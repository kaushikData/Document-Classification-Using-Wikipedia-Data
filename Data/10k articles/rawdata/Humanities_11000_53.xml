      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14977">A controversy arose during the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016|2016 Legislative Council election]] in Hong Kong as the [[Electoral Affairs Commission]] (EAC) banned six potential [[Localism in Hong Kong|localist]] candidates from running for the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo). The EAC carried out a new election measure to require all candidates to sign an additional "confirmation form" in the nomination to declare their understanding of Hong Kong being an inalienable part of China as stipulated in the Article 1, Article 12 and Article 159(4) of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]].

Localist [[Hong Kong Indigenous]]'s [[Edward Leung]] and [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democrat]] [[League of Social Democrats]] (LSD) [[Avery Ng]] sought a [[judicial review]] but the court refused to immediately hear the judicial reviews. Leung subsequently signed the confirmation form but was asked by returning officers whether they would still advocate independence along with some other localist candidates including [[Civic Passion]]'s [[Alvin Cheng]] and [[Hong Kong National Party]]'s [[Chan Ho-tin]].

After the end of the nomination period, nominations of six localist candidates, Hong Kong National Party's Chan Ho-tin, [[Democratic Progressive Party of Hong Kong|Democratic Progressive Party]]'s Yeung Ke-cheong, Nationalist Hong Kong's Nakade Hitsujiko, [[Conservative Party (Hong Kong)|Conservative Party]]'s Alice Lai Yee-man, Hong Kong Indigenous's Edward Leung and independent Chan Kwok-keung, were "invalidated", including Edward Leung which EAC returning officer Cora Ho Lai-sheung rejected Leung's nomination on the basis of she did not trust Leung "genuinely changed his previous stance for independence."

==Course of events==

===Confirmation form===
On 14 July 2016, the [[Electoral Affairs Commission]] (EAC) announced its plan to require all candidates to sign an additional "confirmation form" in the nomination to declare their understanding of Hong Kong being an inalienable part of China as stipulated in the Article 1 of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]], Article 12 which stated that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall be a local administrative region of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), which shall enjoy a high degree of autonomy and come directly under the [[Central People's Government]], as well as Article 159(4) which stipulated that no amendment to the Basic Law shall contravene the established basic policies of the PRC regarding Hong Kong (i.e. Hong Kong should be a special administrative region of the PRC under the “one country, two systems” principle). Article 104 also required members of the Legislative Council to swear to uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region before assuming office.&lt;ref name="gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=
HKSAR Government responds to media enquiries regarding 2016 Legislative Council election|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201607/30/P2016073000700.htm|work=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As many potential localist candidates are advocating or promoting Hong Kong independence, the EAC stated that “independence of the HKSAR” was inconsistent with the constitutional and legal status of the HKSAR as stipulated in the Basic Law, as well as the established basic policies of the PRC regarding Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="gov"/&gt; It also stated that returning officers were required to take into account all relevant information before deciding whether a nomination is valid according to {{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|name=Legislative Council Ordinance|542|42A}} and Electoral Affairs Commission (Electoral Procedure) (Legislative Council) Regulation [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/03A8423C8A03F968482575EF0016E835?OpenDocument&amp;bt=0 541D] § 16 (the Regulation) and request the candidate to provide any other information the returning officer deems appropriate to satisfy him/her that the nomination is valid according to Sections 10 or 11 of the Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201607/19/P2016071900950p.htm|title=EAC's request to sign Confirmation Form has legal basis|date=19 July 2016|work=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor]] director Law Yuk-kai criticised the government's move as "censorship of political ideas" and a breach of [[freedom of thought]].&lt;ref name="cant run"/&gt;

[[Localism in Hong Kong|Localist]] candidates reacted differently to the new measure. [[Civic Passion]]'s [[Alvin Cheng]] signed the confirmation form when he submitted his nomination to run in the [[Hong Kong Island (constituency)|Hong Kong Island constituency]]. Civic Passion spokesman and [[New Territories West (constituency)|New Territories West]] candidate [[Cheng Chung-tai]] justified the group's decision as a form of civil disobedience.

[[Edward Leung]] of the pro-independence [[Hong Kong Indigenous]] who won over 66,000 votes in February's [[New Territories East by-election, 2016|New Territories East by-election]] said he would not sign the form and would seek a [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name="cant run"&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Accept Hong Kong is part of China or you can’t run in Legco elections’|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1989910/accept-hong-kong-part-china-or-you-cant-run-legco-elections|date=14 July 2016|newspaper=South China Morning Post|first1=Joyce|last1=Ng|last2=Ng|first2=Kang-chung}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pan-democrats]] also stated they would boycott the new election measure by not signing the additional form.&lt;ref name=thestandard171871&gt;{{cite news|title=Pan-dems reject poll declaration|first=Phoenix|last=Un|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news.php?id=171871|newspaper=The Standard|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Returning officers' emails===
On 22 July, Edward Leung, who had not yet signed the confirmation form, received email from the EAC asking if he would still advocate Hong Kong independence after submitting the original nomination form stating he would uphold the Basic Law and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Civic Passion’s Alvin Cheng and the Hong Kong National Party’s [[Chan Ho-tin]] both received similar emails on 25 July.&lt;ref name=20160726hongkongfp&gt;{{cite news|title=Election officials email more pro-independence LegCo candidates asking about political stance|first=Kris|last=Cheng|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/07/26/election-officials-email-more-pro-independence-legco-candidates-asking-about-political-stance/|newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other localist candidates, Nationalist Hong Kong's Nakade Hitsujiko and [[Conservative Party (Hong Kong)|Conservative Party]]'s Alice Lai Yee-man, received similar emails in the following days. Those questions were claimed to be a factor to determine the validity of their nominations.

===Judicial review attempt===
Represented by [[Senior Counsel]] [[Martin Lee]], [[Edward Leung]] and [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democrat]] [[League of Social Democrats]] (LSD) chairman [[Avery Ng]] and general secretary Chan Tak-cheung filed a judicial review, arguing that the EAC had acted beyond its powers, and accuse the government of political censorship. On 27 July, [[High Court of Hong Kong|High Court]] judge Justice Thomas Au Hing-cheung refused to immediately hear the judicial reviews, as he said he saw no urgency in dealing with the case before the end of the nomination period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Setback to legal challenge against new Hong Kong election rule|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1995611/setback-legal-challenge-against-new-hong-kong-election-rule|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=27 July 2016|first1=Eddie|last1=Lee|first2=Owen|last2=Fung}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the court's decision, Leung agreed to sign the confirmation form.&lt;ref name=scmp1996189&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong localist gives in to election rule while others stick to their guns and are cleared to run|first=Owen|last=Fung|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1996189/hong-kong-localist-gives-election-rule-while-others-stick|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invalidations===
On 30 July, Chan Ho-tin received an email from the EAC which said his nomination in New Territories West had been "invalidated" as he did not comply with the {{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|name=Legislative Council Ordinance|542|40|1|b}}, since he had refused to sign the additional confirmation form.&lt;ref name="disqualified"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong National Party convenor disqualified from running in Legislative Council polls|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=30 July 2016|first1=Emily|last1=Tsang|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Cheung|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1996994/hong-kong-national-party-convenor-disqualified-running}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day after, Yeung Ke-cheong of the localist [[Democratic Progressive Party of Hong Kong|Democratic Progressive Party]], positioned second on a candidate list with Jonathan Ho Chi-kwong in [[Kowloon West (constituency)|Kowloon West]] was also invalidated as he, unlike Chan, explicitly rejected the Basic Law by not signing both the original and additional confirmation forms to pledge to uphold the Basic Law. Yeung said he would launch a judicial review.&lt;ref name=scmp1997371&gt;{{cite news|title=‘I was disqualified’: second Hong Kong localist candidate barred from running in Legco elections|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=31 July 2016|first=Jeffie|last=Lam|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1997371/i-was-disqualified-second-hong-kong-localist-candidate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-independence candidate Nakade Hitsujiko for New Territories West became the third candidate to be disqualified on 1 August even though he had signed the new form.&lt;ref name=scmp1997860&gt;{{cite news|title=Two radical Hong Kong localists await their fate while a third Legco candidate is banned|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=1 August 2016|first=Joyce|last=Ng|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1997860/two-radical-hong-kong-localists-await-their-fate-while-third}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also previously run in [[Hong Kong local elections, 2015|2015 District Council election]].

On 2 August, three more localist candidates were disqualified, Conservative Party's Alice Lai Yee-man in Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong Indigenous' Edward Leung who ran in February and received more than 66,000 votes in the [[New Territories East by-election, 2016|New Territories East by-election]] and independent Chan Kwok-keung in New Territories East while nominations of Clarence Ronald Leung Kam-shing and Yau Man-king on Chan's list were validated.&lt;ref name=20160802standnews&gt;{{cite news|title=梁天琦遭選管會　取消參選資格|work=Stand News|date=2 August 2016|url=https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E6%A2%81%E5%A4%A9%E7%90%A6%E9%81%AD%E9%81%B8%E7%AE%A1%E6%9C%83-%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%88%E5%8F%83%E9%81%B8%E8%B3%87%E6%A0%BC/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her letter, EAC returning officer Cora Ho Lai-sheung rejected Leung's nomination with the attachment of Leung’s Facebook posts, newspaper clippings and cited transcripts of his remarks at press conferences, and stated that although Leung had signed the forms, she did not believe that Leung "genuinely changed his previous stance for independence."&lt;ref name=scmp1998201&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Indigenous’ Edward Leung disqualified from Legco elections

===Lawyers' joint statement===
On 3 August, all 30 Legal Subsector members of the 1,200-strong [[Election Committee]], which is responsible for choosing [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] including former [[Hong Kong Bar Association]] chairmen Edward Chan King-sang SC and Philip Dykes SC questioned whether returning officers had the power to investigate the “genuineness” of candidates’ declarations and accordingly disqualify their candidacies. In the statement, it wrote that "[the Section 40 of the Legislative Council Ordinance] does not give the returning officer any power to inquire into the so-called genuineness of the candidates’ declarations, let alone making a subjective and political decision to disqualify a candidate without following any due process on the purported ground that the candidate will not genuinely uphold the Basic Law." It also wrote that "arbitrary and unlawful exercise of powers by government officials ... are most damaging to the rule of law in Hong Kong."&lt;ref name="lawyers"/&gt;

However, [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Rimsky Yuen]] said officers did have the power to consider some evidence, as they had done in the past. He did not specify any past cases.&lt;ref name="lawyers"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawyers question power of returning officers to disqualify Hong Kong poll candidates|date=3 August 2016|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1998842/lawyers-question-power-returning-officers-disqualify-hong|first=Joyce|last=Ng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="First pro-independence rally"===
On 5 August, the Hong Kong independence advocates who were banned from the election launched a rally which was dubbed “first pro-independence rally in Hong Kong”. The rally drew about 12000 people. The pro-independence activists vowed they would press on with their cause and campaign for wider public support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong localists remain defiant at ‘historic’ rally|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=5 August 2016|first1=Joyce|last1=Ng|first2=Tony|last2=Cheung|first3=Owen|last3=Fung|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1999664/more-1000-hong-kong-police-mobilised-localist-rally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the course of [[Enlargement of the European Union|EU accession negotiations]] [[Croatia]] harmonised its media legislation to European standards. This process touched also legislation on access to public information which has been amended to reflect European and international standards.&lt;ref name=KAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.13596/ |title=Media Freedom in Croatia (2006-2016) |last= |first= |date=2016 |website= Kas.de |publisher=KAS Media Program South East Europe |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Croatia thus adopted its law on the Right of Access to Public Information in 2013, after a decade of advocacy, campaigns, and public discussions led by civil society organisations.&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/croatia |title=Croatia. Freedom of the Press 2015 |last= |first= |date=2015 |website=Freedomhouse.org |publisher=Freedom House |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ECPMF&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecpmf.eu/news/ecpmf/interviews-balkan/barbara-matejcic-freelance-journalist-croatia |title=”I can’t say it raised the level of general transparency” |last= |first= |date=12 January 2017 |website= Ecpmf.eu |publisher=European Centre for Press and Media Freedom |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the improvements of the legal framework regulating access to public information, problems remain in the implementation, especially for journalists willing to request and obtain information from the government.&lt;ref name="KAS" /&gt;
 
==Legal framework==
 
In Croatia, access to public information has become a constitutional right with the 2010 amendments of the Constitution.&lt;ref name=GONG&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nives Miošić and Duje Prkut  |date=July 2012 |title=Access to information in Croatia: Exercise of a Constitutional Right in an Institutional Culture of Secrecy|url= https://dgap.org/sites/default/files/article_downloads/GONG%20(Zagreb)_Access%20to%20information%20in%20Croatia.pdf  |publisher=GONG Policy Research Center |issue= |access-date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regulated by the '''Law on the Right to Access Information''' adopted by the [[Croatian Parliament]] in 2013. The Law also regulates the [[re-use of information]] held by public authorities. The Law complies with the Directive 2003/98/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] on the re-use of public sector information and with Regulation 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revizija.hr/en/access-to-information/law-on-the-right-to-access-information |title=Law on the Right of Access to Information |last= |first= |date= |website=Revizija.hr |publisher=Republic of Croatia. State Audit Office |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the Law, the right of access to information encompasses the right of the beneficiaries, i.e. any local or foreign natural person or legal entity, to seek and acquire information, as well as the obligation of public authorities to guarantee access to requested information, regardless of the request.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
The Croatian law on Access to public information is  in informed by four principles:
 	
* the principle of '''publicity''' and '''free access''', meaning that information are available to any national or foreign natural persons or legal entity as established by the Law;
* the principle of '''timeliness, entirety and accuracy''' of information, meaning that information disclosed under the Law must be timely provided, complete and accurate;
* the principle of '''equality''', meaning that the right of access to information is granted to every beneficiary in an equal manner;	
* the principle of '''disposal of information''', meaning that beneficiaries that obtained the information in accordance with the Law, are entitled to disclose this information in public.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

Public bodies are obliged to publish on the Internet the following relevant information: laws and other regulations in their field of activity, including draft proposals of laws; general acts and decisions affecting the interests of beneficiaries; annual plans, programmes, strategies and financial reports referring to the work of public authority bodies; information on budget, financing sources and subsidies; information on their internal organisation; notes and conclusions from official sessions; information on public procurement and tenders; information on the way of exercising rights of access to and re-use of information, including contact details of the Information Commissioner and the fee required to access and re-use of information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
For the purpose of ensuring the right of access to information, the Law establishes that public bodies are obliged to appoint an [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]], a special official in charge of resolving the issues emerging from the exercise of the right of access to information. Specifically, the Information Commissioner shall conduct the tasks connected to disclosure of public information in accordance with the Law, including providing the necessary assistance to applicants, improving the manner of processing, classification and safe-keeping of the information, and maintaining the Information Commissioner Register.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

===Restrictions to the right of access to information===
 
Public authority bodies may restrict access to information if:
 		 
* the information has been classified, in accordance with the law regulating classified information;
 
* if the information represents a trade or professional secret;
 
* in the information is a tax-related secret;
 
* is the information is protected by the law regulating the protection of personal information;
 
* the information may seriously undermine an ongoing decision-making process;
 
* the information is restricted in accordance with international treaties.
 
Moreover, restrictions may be operated when there can be reasonable doubts that disclosing the requested information might  prevent the efficiency, independence or impartiality of ongoing proceedings or the execution of court orders and sentence.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
===Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test===
 
The public authority body in charge of acting upon the request of access to information is obliged to conduct the Proportionality Interest Test in order to reach the decision about disclosure. [[Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test]] refer to the assessment of proportionality between reasons for granting access to information and reasons for imposing restrictions and granting access to information only when the public interest prevails. If, on the basis of the Test, the public interest prevails over the damage caused to other protected interests, the information shall be disclosed.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
===Procedures===
 
Public authorities are bound to grant access to information by timely publishing the information on their work in an accessible manner, i.e. on the webpage, or in the Official Gazette and the Central catalogue of officials documents of the Republic of Croatia, etc. Information can be provided directly, or in writing, or by giving insight into documents and making copies of the documents containing the requested information, or by delivering copies of the requested information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Applicants can submit the request either orally or in written form. The submitter of the request is not obliged to mention any reason for requesting access to information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Access to public information does not require paying any administrative and court fees. The beneficiaries might only be called to pay for the actual costs of providing the information requested.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Authorities are obliged to issue their decisions within 15 days from the day of submitting a request. This deadline can be prolonged  by other 15 days in case of complex requests (e.g. when the information must be sought outside the offices of the public authority concerned, when a single request contains a request for different information, or when the situation requires to conduct the Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test, etc.) &lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
If the public authority does not hold the information, it is obliged to transfer the request to the body that might have it and notify the submitter thereof.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 	
===Right to appeal===
 
Against the Decision taken by the public authority, the applicant may file a Complaint to the Commissioner within 15 days since the Decision has been delivered. 
 
No complaint may be filed against the decision issued by the Commission, but an administrative dispute may be initiated before the High Administrative Court of the Republic of Croatia.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 	
===Re-use of information===
 
The Croatian law on access to public information regulates also the right to re-use information for commercial or non-commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 

==Access to public information in practice==
 
The Croatian law on access to public information is quite advanced and in line with international standards and best practices. However, in the country a culture of secrecy persists. &lt;ref name=MySociety&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mysociety.org/2016/09/29/journalists-celebrate-freedom-of-information-croatia/  |title=Journalists celebrate Freedom of Information: Croatia |last= |first= |date=29 September 2016 |website=Mysociety.org |publisher=mySociety |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the law, by itself, has not changed this and so far it has not raised the level of general transparency in Croatian society and institutions.&lt;ref name=ECPMF/&gt;&lt;ref name=MySociety/&gt;
 	
One of the main problem affecting the realization of the right of access to public information is the lack of adequate resources allocated to the office of the Commissioner. According to the 2015 Report on the implementation of the law presented to the Parliament, an increase in the resources for the functioning of the Commissioner’s Office if compared with previous years, they are still too limited to allow for the full application of the law. Over the course of 2015, the number of cases dealt with by the Commissioner’s Office has increased. However, the report showed that, due to a lack of staff and resources, not all the complaints received during 2015 have been solved by the Commissioner’s Office.&lt;ref name=HALTER&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Croazia/Croazia-al-di-sopra-dell-opinione-pubblica-17749 |title=Croazia: al di sopra dell'opinione pubblica |last=Gabrić |first=Toni |date=14 February 2017 |website=Balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa|language=Italian |access-date=14 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another problem concerns the limited application of proactive disclosure, which - according to the Commissioner [[Anamarija Musa]] - together with re-use of information, a milestone of access to public information in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt; Also, according to Commissioner Musa, the implementation of the law is particularly problematic at regional and local level and when it comes to requesting information to private entities providing a public service or to enterprises where the state holds the majority of capital shares.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt; Moreover, Commissioner Musa deems particularly concerning the fact that access to public information requests are regularly ignored, so that the two thirds of the overall complaints received by the Commissioner are caused by this reason.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt;
 
===''Imamo pravo znati'' (“We have right to know”) platform===
 	
In Croatia, the web platform imamopravoznati.org, developed using the Alavetely software, has been launched to facilitate citizens' exercise of the right of access to public information. It allows to submit requests for public information to Croatian public authorities, and track their answers. Historic requests, any correspondence between the applicant and public authorities, are archived and publicly online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imamopravoznati.org |title= Imamo pravo znati |last= |first= |date= |website=Imamopravoznati.org |publisher= |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Air Pirates''' were a group of cartoonists who created two issues of an [[underground comics|underground comic]] called ''Air Pirates Funnies'' in [[1971 in comics|1971]], leading to a famous lawsuit by [[Walt Disney Productions]].&lt;ref name="ts"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Sito|authorlink=Tom Sito|title=Drawing the Line: The Untold Story of the Animation Unions from Bosko to Bart Simpson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZ0PsCWPSZ0C|date=October 6, 2006|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-7148-2|pages=236–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Dan O'Neill]], the group also included [[Bobby London]], [[Shary Flenniken]], [[Gary Hallgren]], and [[Ted Richards (comics artist)|Ted Richards]].

The original Air Pirates were a gang of [[Mickey Mouse]] antagonists of the 1930s; Dan O'Neill imagined Mickey Mouse to be a symbol of conformist hypocrisy in American culture, and therefore a ripe target for satire.

== Overview ==
The lead stories in both issues of ''Air Pirates Funnies'' (published by [[Last Gasp]] in July &amp; August 1971), created by O'Neill, London, and Hallgren, focused on [[Walt Disney]] characters, most notably from [[Floyd Gottfredson]]'s Mickey Mouse newspaper strip, with the Disney characters engaging in adult behaviors such as [[sexual intercourse|sex]] and [[recreational drug use|drug]] consumption. O'Neill insisted it would dilute the parody to change the names of the characters, so his adventurous mouse character was called "Mickey". Ted Richards took on the [[Big Bad Wolf]] and the [[Three Little Pigs]], opening up a second wave of parody attacking Disney's appropriation of European (and American) folklore. In doing so, they infringed Disney's copyrights by using characters the company created without permission. On October 21, 1971, Disney filed a lawsuit against O'Neill, Hallgren, London and Richards (Flenniken had not contributed to the parody stories).

== Air Pirates collective history ==
The nucleus of the ''Air Pirates'' collective began to form in late 1969-early 1970, when London met Richards at the office of the ''[[Berkeley Tribe]]'', an underground newspaper where both were staff cartoonists. (London later drew a highly fictionalized account of their experiences at the ''Tribe'' in his story "Why [[Bobby Seale]] is Not Black" in ''Merton of the Movement'' [Last Gasp's "Cocoanut Comix" imprint, Oct. 1972].) In 1970 London and Richards attended the [[Sky River Rock Festival]] near [[Portland, Oregon]], and met Flenniken and O'Neill at the media booth,&lt;ref name=Ringgenberg&gt;RINGGENBERG, S.C. [http://www.comic-art.com/intervws/londart.htm "Bobby London and the Air Pirates Follies,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716132120/http://www.comic-art.com/intervws/londart.htm |date=2011-07-16 }} ''Comix Art &amp; Graffix Gallery'' (5-12-98).&lt;/ref&gt; where Flenniken was producing a daily Sky River newsletter on a mimeograph machine. Before the festival was over the four of them produced a four-page tabloid comic, ''Sky River Funnies'', mostly drawn by London. O'Neill also met Seattle-based cartoonist [[Gary Hallgren]] at the festival.

Meanwhile, O'Neill, who was producing the strip ''[[Odd Bodkins]]'' for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', but was fearful of losing his copyright over it, decided on an odd tactic to regain control of his strip: ''he'' would engage in copyright infringement, which he reasoned would force the newspaper to surrender the strip's copyright back to him for fear of being sued. O'Neill worked 28 Walt Disney characters, including Mickey Mouse and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], into the strip. In late November 1970, the ''Chronicle'' fired O'Neill for the final time and discontinued the strip.

After the Sky River Rock Festival, Flenniken, Richards, and Hallgren returned to Seattle, where Flenniken created graphics for the [[Seattle Liberation Front]]'s brief-lived underground newspaper, ''[[Sabot (newspaper)|Sabot]]''. London went back to San Francisco with O'Neil and started working with him, contributing a "basement" strip to ''Odd Bodkins''. 

In early 1971 O'Neill invited Flenniken, Richards, and Hallgren  to San Francisco to form the Air Pirates collective.&lt;ref name="Rosenkranz2002b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Rosenkranz|title=Rebel Visions: the Underground Comix Revolution, 1963-1975|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;ei=zuchSp_yEYbikwTq9qnzDA&amp;as_brr=0&amp;id=tn9QAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Larry+Welz%22&amp;q=%2B%22media+booth%22|year=2002|publisher=Fantagraphics Books|isbn=978-1-56097-464-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Pirates lived together in a warehouse on Harrison Street in San Francisco,&lt;ref name=Apex&gt;Donahue, Don and Susan Goodrick, editors. ''The Apex Treasury of Underground Comics'' (Links Books/Quick Fox, 1974), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; where London and Flenniken began a relationship that turned into a short-lived marriage.&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;Boyd, Robert. [http://www.tcj.com/the-shary-flenniken-interview/ "The Shary Flenniken Interview,"] ''The Comics Journal'' #146 (November 1991): "We were up here from 1973 ’til ’76. We broke up and Bobby went back to New York."&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the cartoonists shared a common interest in the styles of past masters of the comic strip, and — unrelated to their assault on Disney — in creating their stories for Air Pirates projects each set out to imitate the style of an old-time cartoonist:
* [[Shary Flenniken]]'s ''Trots and Bonnie'' imitated [[Clare Briggs]] and [[H. T. Webster]]
* [[Gary Hallgren]]'s ''Pollyanna Pals'' imitated [[Cliff Sterrett]]'s ''[[Polly and Her Pals]]''
*  [[Bobby London]]'s ''[[Dirty Duck (comics)|Dirty Duck]]'' imitated [[George Herriman]]'s [[Krazy Kat]]
* [[Ted Richards (comics artist)|Ted Richards]]' ''Dopin' Dan'' imitated [[Mort Walker]]'s ''[[Beetle Bailey]]''&lt;ref name="Rosenkranz2002b" /&gt;

After the Pirates were established, [[Willy Murphy]], [[Larry Todd]] and Gary King started hanging around the collective and contributing to their projects, missing the original ''Air Pirates Funnies'' but appearing in later Air Pirates comics.

== Disney lawsuit==
Accurately telling the story of Disney's lawsuit against the Air Pirates is difficult, due to the conflicting memories of the litigants; however, it is fair to say that all through the lawsuit, O'Neill was deviant. He was so eager to be sued by Disney that he had copies of ''Air Pirates Funnies'' am  into a Disney board meeting by the son of a board member. On October 21, 1971, he got his wish as Disney filed a lawsuit against O'Neill, Hallgren, London and Richards (Flenniken had not contributed to the parody stories),&lt;ref name=Ringgenberg /&gt; alleging, among other things, copyright infringement, trademark infringement, and unfair competition. Disney later added Last Gasp publisher [[Ron Turner (publisher)|Ron Turner]]'s name to the suit. The Pirates, in turn, claimed that the parody was [[fair use]].&lt;ref name="ts" /&gt;

The initial decision by Judge Wollenberg in the California District Court, delivered on July 7, 1972, went against the Air Pirates, and O'Neill's lawyers appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]. O'Neill suggested the other Pirates settle, and leave him to defend the case alone. Hallgren and Turner settled with Disney, but London and Richards decided to continue fighting. To raise money for the Air Pirates Defense Fund, O'Neill and other underground cartoonists sold original artwork — predominantly of Disney characters — at [[comic book conventions]].

During the legal proceedings and in violation of the temporary restraining order, the Air Pirates published some of the material intended for the third issue of ''Air Pirates Funnies'' in the comic ''The Tortoise and the Hare'' (Last Gasp, 1971), of which nearly 10,000 issues were soon confiscated under a court order. In 1975, Disney won a $200,000 preliminary judgement and another restraining order, which O'Neill defied by continuing to draw Disney parodies.&lt;ref name="ts" /&gt;

The case dragged on for several years. Finally, in 1978, the Ninth Circuit ruled against the Air Pirates 3-0 for copyright infringement, although they dismissed the trademark infringement claims.&lt;ref name="ts" /&gt; In 1979 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] refused to hear an appeal. O'Neill later claimed that his plan in the Disney lawsuit was to lose, appeal, lose again, continue drawing his parodies, and eventually to force the courts to either allow him to continue or send him to jail.

O'Neill's four-page Mickey Mouse story ''Communiqué #1 from the M.L.F.'' (Mouse Liberation Front) appeared in the magazine ''[[CoEvolution Quarterly]]'' #21 in 1979. Disney asked the court to hold O'Neill in [[contempt of court]] and have him prosecuted criminally, along with [[Stewart Brand]], publisher of ''CoEvolution Quarterly''.&lt;ref name="ceo"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Brand|first=Stewart|date=Summer 1979|title="Disney Sues O'Neill, Brand and POINT"|magazine=Co-Evolution Quarterly|issue=22|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1979, O'Neill recruited diverse artists for a "secret" artist's organization, The Mouse Liberation Front. An M.L.F. art show was displayed in [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]. With the help of sympathetic Disney employees, O'Neill delivered ''The M.L.F. Communiqué #2'' in person to the Disney studios, where he posed drawing Mickey Mouse at an animation table and allegedly smoked a [[joint (cannabis)|joint]] in Walt Disney's office.&lt;ref name="bl"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bob Levin|title=The Pirates and the Mouse: Disney's War Against the Counterculture|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=ya2RAAAAMAAJ|date=2003|publisher=Fantagraphics Books|isbn=1-56097-530-X|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, weighing the unrecoverable $190,000 in damages and $2,000,000 in legal fees against O'Neill's continuing disregard for the court's decisions, Disney settled the case, dropping the contempt charges and promising not to enforce the judgment as long as the Pirates no longer infringed Disney's copyrights.

In Bob Levin's 2003 book ''The Pirates and The Mouse: Disney's War Against the Counterculture'', [[New York Law School]] professor Edward Samuels said, "I was flabbergasted. He told me he had won the case. 'No, Dan,' I told him, 'You lost.'  'No, I won.' 'No, you lost.' To Dan O'Neill, not going to jail constituted victory." However, Samuels said of the Air Pirates, "They set parody back twenty years."

Before television, studios played their films in theaters exclusively. However, in 1950 many studios began to sell all their pre-1948 features to television syndicators. The television syndicators then would use these films to fill in their programming schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Criticism-Ideology/Distribution-ANCILLARY-MARKETS.html |title=Ancillary markets - Distribution |first= |last= |work=filmreference.com |year=2013 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in the 1960s, the first domestic ancillary market for feature films was created. NBC was the first to practice the market on September 23, 1961 by programming "NBC Saturday Night at the Movies." After such success, ABC became the second network ever to program a series of prime time features in 1962. One of the other networks, CBS, followed and added a prime time feature program in 1965.

Today, feature films opens in motion picture theaters to establish its box-office value. After that is established, it is then released to ancillary markets in a particular order as follows:

* Video and [[Pay Per View]] (PPV)
* Premium cable services such as HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax
* Cable television
* Network television
* Television syndication

The sequence is to maximize the full economic potential of each market.

==VCR==
Home video recorders were made public when Sony introduced the half-inch Betamax cassette in 1975. Following Betamax, the company JVC introduced the Video Home System (VHS).  Marketed by RCA and manufactured by Matsushita, VHS soon became known as the video-cassette recorders (VCRs). VCRs, which gave the consumer the option of recording programs from television, were a new form of competition in the demanding consumer market. VCRs revenue contributed to the development of the ancillary market of video and DVD. By the 1980s, five million households owned VCRs. Major studios had not yet adapted to the new video technologies that were being developed for consumers. There were no anticipations of new markets or other opportunities to expand until an entrepreneur, Andre Blay, opened Hollywood film companies’ eyes. Blay wanted the license to transfer and sell their films on tape.  After he succeeded and his approach was beneficial, film companies all around became a part of the video distribution. The film companies could not deny the fact that this new distribution would lead to a new revenue stream.&lt;ref&gt;P., McDonald &amp; J., Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==DVD==
As the VHS market saturated, multiple media executives and manufacturers liked the idea of utilizing other home video technologies. In 1993, the film industry upgraded their technology with the creation of several new formats including the DVD, or digital video disc. Many manufacturers such as the Japanese (Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Pioneer, Sony and Toshiba) and the European (Philips and Thomson) collaborated to facilitate development of the DVD Forum. In March 1997, the US launch of the DVD systems went smoothly due to Hollywood's solidarity. Manufacturers and film studios decided to avoid making the same mistake of the VHS format battles and agreed upon a universal standard of cooperation. When first introduced in 1997, DVDs sold at the low price of $20, for which they offered high-quality image and extra special features. Consumers liked the advantages of the DVDs and soon surpassed VHS sales.&lt;ref&gt;Wasser, Frederick.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video and DVD: Hollywood Retools". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premium television==

The first premium rate television services were [[Phonevision]], [[Telemeter (pay television)|Telemeter]], SubscriberVision, among others. None of them were successful, until the launch of Home Box Office ([[HBO]]) in 1972, considered the first successful premium-rate subscription television service. Other services were launched: [[Z Channel]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], [[The Movie Channel]], [[Cinemax]], [[Spotlight (TV channel)|Spotlight]] and [[Home Theater Network]]. Only Showtime, The Movie Channel and Cinemax survived through the 1980s. These premium rate services air features unedited, uncut, and commercial-free, the same way they were shown on theaters and/or home video.

==Cable television==
{{Empty section|date=June 2011}}

==Network television==
Out of the many ancillary markets out there, none were more effective and revenue rewarding than network television, and eventually syndication began. [[Amanda D. Lotz]] spoke on the radical change in her book titled ''Television Will Be Revolutionized (2008)."
She mentions how time went on and as the post-network era developed, that the limited ways there were for medium to be distributed was eliminated. What was expanding, and evolving was network television as a whole.&lt;Lotz 85&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lotz|first=Amanda|title=Television Will be Revolutionized|year=2007|publisher=NYU Press|pages=86|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/archivedassets/096/15646.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt; At first channels were few, and very limited. But soon came the multi-channel transition, then on with the creation of cable TV. As that later expended cable began to see the 'cash cow' in that and began selling shares to different networks in order to air their studio programs. Not only did Network Television open up ancillary markets for TV, but other markets as well. The VCR then became a hot commodity, because the consumer wanted the option of recording. That slowly transitioned to the DVD that took out the VCR, and finally DVR. Which seems to be just that, a VCR and a DVD combined. Network television took a gigantic step when it later allowed programs to have different showing dates, and even multiple air times. This offered different networks to still be able to ear revenue off of an older film that already has left the box office.

==Making Television Safe for Film==

According to McDonald and Wasko, Hollywood's interest in emerging medium of television dates from the 1920s and includes experiments with the developing technology, an alternative model of television as home theater, applications for television frequencies, as well as investments in broadcasting companies that were exploring television (Anderson, 1994; Hilmes, 1990; Wasko, 1994). The evidence suggests that studios clearly wanted to control the development and implementation of television technology. Securing that control required the assistance of the Federal Communication Commission, which regulated television's development by articulating technical standards and operating rules and through the FCC's exclusive right to license the use of television frequencies for experimentation or broadcast (McDonald and Wasko, p.&amp;nbsp;107).

==Video games==
Video games are a rapidly growing ancillary market for feature films. Video game over-all gross income has consistently surpassed that of movie sales since 2004. Because of the increased interest in video games many major media and communication companies have begun to show interest in video games as a way to market, brand, and advertise for their product.  Some movies that have benefited from this are the ''Harry Potter'', ''Lord of the Rings'', and ''James Bond'' series. Because the video game industry has been able to outplay and outgross many movies, video game manufacturers are beginning to look in the direction of producing their own movies as well. Microsoft's producers of ''Halo'' have decided to pass Hollywood studios and produce their own movie.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Randy.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video Games: Promises and Challenges of an Emerging Industry". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollywood has shown interest in the video game industry as an ancillary market almost as far as video games have existed. The film industry's goal within the video game industry is to either seek control and therefore ownership of the video game market or to license products to video game producers. Once the video game profits are high, that is when Hollywood seeks control. On the other hand, when profits are down, that is when Hollywood offers the licensing. The collaboration had always been problematic since the film industry had been uncertain about the development of video games. Hollywood has seen video games as another promotional scheme for a film.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Randy.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video Games: Promises and Challenges of an Emerging Industry". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recorded Music==
Hollywood has had interactions with the recorded music industry that dates back as far as the studio system itself.  The interactions between the two include three main periods; 1927-1957: recorded music as a form of promotion, 1957-1977: recorded music as cross-promotion and ancillary revenue, and 1977-1997: recorded music as cross-promotion, ancillary revenue stream, and means of spreading risk.
In addition to music's promotional value, studios realized that, "A chart success was an effective way of generating additional revenue for their companies, both in terms of publishing and performance royalties and, of course, in outright sales."  Recorded music proved to be of great value as an ancillary market to the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-3388-3|pages=143–151|author=Smith, Jeff|authorlink=Ancillary Markets-Recorded Music: Charting the Rise and Fall of the Soundtrack Album|editor=McDonald &amp; Wasko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antisemitica''' designates, in the fields of [[book collecting]], and [[rare book]] dealing, the collection and distribution of books, pamphlets, serials, posters, and other printed literature, of an [[antisemitic]] nature. It is to be noted that antisemitica does not, generally, designate antisemitic activity, or antisemites themselves. In the [[United States]], the [[freedom of the press]] does not limit the publication or distribution of antisemitic literature, and there are scholarly and historical interests in such material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10855">[[File:Stonedhenge.jpg|thumb|The sun shining through a trilithon at Stonehenge]]
The prehistoric monument of [[Stonehenge]] has long been studied for its possible connections with ancient astronomy. The site is aligned in the direction of the sunrise of the summer solstice and the sunset of the winter solstice. [[archaeoastronomy|Archaeoastronomers]] have made a range of further claims about the site’s connection to astronomy, its meaning, and its use.

==Early work==
Stonehenge has an opening in the henge earthwork facing northeast, and suggestions that particular significance was placed by its builders on the [[solstice]] and [[equinox]] points have followed. For example, the summer solstice sun rose close to the Heel Stone, and the sun’s first rays shone into the centre of the monument between the horseshoe arrangement. While it is possible that such an alignment could be coincidental, this astronomical orientation had been acknowledged since [[William Stukeley]] drew the site and first identified its axis along the midsummer sunrise in 1720.&lt;ref&gt;William Stukeley, [http://newensign.christsassembly.com/Stonehenge_Stuckley.pdf ''Stonehenge, A Temple Restor’d to the British Druids''], W Innys &amp; R Manby, London (1740), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stukeley noticed that the Heel Stone was not precisely aligned on the sunrise. The drifting of the position of the sunrise due to the change in the obliquity of the [[ecliptic]] since the monument’s erection does not account for this imprecision. Recently, evidence has been found for a neighbour to the [[Heel Stone]], no longer extant. The second stone may have instead been one side of a ‘solar corridor’ used to frame the sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stonehenge: Circles of the Season | url = http://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/xpeditions/activities/07/popup/stonehenge.html | accessdate = 2008-04-12 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080427012558/http://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/xpeditions/activities/07/popup/stonehenge.html| archivedate= 27 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Ruggles | first = Clive | author2 = Hoskin, Michael | title = Astronomy Before History | encyclopedia = The Cambridge Concise History of Astronomy | editor-last = Hoskin | editor-first = Michael |volume=| pages = 6 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge | date = 1999 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4nmjGztzfZwC&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=heel+stone+companion+discovered#PPR5,M1 | accessdate = 2008-04-12 | isbn = 0-521-57600-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stukeley and the renowned astronomer [[Edmund Halley]] attempted what amounted to the first scientific attempt to date a prehistoric monument. Stukeley concluded the Stonehenge had been set up “by the use of a magnetic compass to lay out the works, the needle varying so much, at that time, from true north.” He attempted to calculate the change in magnetic variation between the observed and theoretical (ideal) Stonehenge sunrise, which he imagined would relate to the date of construction.  Their calculations returned three dates, the earliest of which, 460&amp;nbsp;BC, was accepted by Stukeley. That was incorrect, but this early exercise in dating is a landmark in field archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Anthony. (2008). ''Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|978-0-500-05155-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early efforts to date Stonehenge exploited changes in astronomical declinations and led to efforts such as H.&amp;nbsp;Broome’s 1864 theory that the monument was built in 977&amp;nbsp;BC, when the star [[Sirius]] would have risen over Stonehenge’s [[Avenue (archaeology)|Avenue]]. Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Norman Lockyer]] proposed a date of 1680 BC based entirely on an incorrect sunrise [[azimuth]] for the Avenue, aligning it on a nearby [[Ordnance Survey]] [[trig point]], a modern feature. Petrie preferred a later date of 730&amp;nbsp;AD. The relevant stones were leaning considerably during his survey, and it was not considered accurate.

An archaeoastronomy debate was triggered by the 1963 publication of ''Stonehenge Decoded'', by [[Gerald Hawkins]] an American astronomer. Hawkins claimed to observe numerous alignments, both lunar and solar.  He argued that Stonehenge could have been used to predict eclipses. Hawkins’ book received wide publicity, in part because he used a computer in his calculations, then a novelty. Archaeologists were suspicious in the face of further contributions to the debate coming from British astronomer C.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;‘Peter’ Newham and Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Fred Hoyle]], the famous Cambridge cosmologist, as well as by [[Alexander Thom]], a retired professor of engineering, who had been studying stone circles for more than 20&amp;nbsp;years. Their theories have faced criticism in recent decades from [[Richard J. C. Atkinson]] and others who have suggested impracticalities in the ‘Stone Age calculator’ interpretation.

==Gerald Hawkins’ work==
[[Image:Stonehenge back wide.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Stonehenge in 2004]]
Gerald Hawkins’ work on Stonehenge was first published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1963 following analyses he had carried out using the Harvard-Smithsonian IBM computer. Hawkins found not one or two alignments but dozens. He had studied 165&amp;nbsp;significant features at the monument and used the computer to check every alignment between them against every rising and setting point for the sun, moon, planets, and bright stars in the positions they would have been in 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE. Thirteen solar and eleven lunar correlations were very precise in relation to the early features at the site but precision was less for later features of the monument. Hawkins also proposed a method for using the [[Aubrey holes]] to predict lunar eclipses by moving markers from hole to hole. In 1965 Hawkins and J.B.&amp;nbsp;White wrote ''[[Stonehenge Decoded]]'', which detailed his findings and proposed that the monument was a ‘Neolithic computer’.

Atkinson replied with his article “Moonshine on Stonehenge” in ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' in 1966, pointing out that some of the pits which Hawkins had used for his sight lines were more likely to have been natural depressions, and that he had allowed a margin of error of up to 2&amp;nbsp;degrees in his alignments. Atkinson found that the probability of so many alignments being visible from 165&amp;nbsp;points to be close to 0.5 (or rather 50:50) rather that the “one in a million” possibility which  Hawkins had claimed. That the Station Stones stood on top of the earlier Aubrey Holes meant that many of Hawkins’ alignments between the two features were illusory. The same article by Atkinson contains further criticisms of the interpretation of [[Aubrey Holes]] as astronomical markers, and of Fred Hoyle’s work.

A question exists over whether the English climate would have permitted accurate observation of  astronomical events. Modern researchers were looking for alignments with phenomena they already knew existed; the prehistoric users of the site did not have this advantage.

==Newham and the Station Stones==
In 1966, C. A. ‘Peter’ Newham described an alignment for the equinoxes by drawing a line between one of the [[Station Stones]] with a posthole next to the Heel Stone. He also identified a lunar alignment; the long sides of the rectangle created by the four station stones matched the moon rise and moonset at the [[major standstill]]. Newham also suggested that the postholes near the entrance were used for observing the [[Saros (astronomy)|saros cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-vWrImYK8K0C&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=peter+Newham+and+the+Station+Stones#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20Newham%20and%20the%20Station%20Stones&amp;f=false | title = Stonehenge | isbn = 1847650759 | author1 = Hill | first1 = Rosemary | date = 2010-12-09 | pmid = 17830710 | volume = 133 | issue = 3460 | pages = 1216–22 | doi = 10.1126/science.133.3460.1216 | journal = Science|bibcode = 1961Sci...133.1216H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Station Stones are damaged and although their positions would create an approximate rectangle, their date and thus their relationship with the other features at the site is uncertain. Stonehenge’s latitude (&amp;nbsp;51°&amp;nbsp;10′&amp;nbsp;44″&amp;nbsp;N&amp;nbsp;) is unusual in that only at this approximate latitude (within about 50&amp;nbsp;km) do the lunar and solar alignments mentioned above occur at right angles to one another. More than 50&amp;nbsp;km north or south of the [[latitude]] of Stonehenge, the station stones could not be set out as a rectangle.

==Alexander Thom’s work==
[[Alexander Thom]] had been examining stone circles since the 1950s in search of astronomical alignments and the [[megalithic yard]].  It was not until 1973 that he turned his attention to Stonehenge. Thom chose to ignore alignments between features within the monument, considering them to be too close together to be reliable. He looked for landscape features that could have marked lunar and solar events. However, one of Thom’s key sites – Peter’s Mound – turned out to be a twentieth-century rubbish dump.

==Later theories==
Although Stonehenge has become an increasingly popular destination during the summer solstice, with 20,000&amp;nbsp;people visiting in 2005, scholars have developed growing evidence that indicates prehistoric people visited the site only during the winter solstice. The only megalithic monuments in the British Isles to contain a clear, compelling solar alignment are [[Newgrange]] and [[Maeshowe]], which both famously face the winter solstice sunrise.

The most recent evidence supporting the theory of winter visits includes bones and teeth from pigs which were slaughtered at nearby [[Durrington Walls]]. Their age at death indicating that they were slaughtered either in December or January every year. Mike Parker Pearson of the [[University of Sheffield]] has said, “We have no evidence that anyone was in the landscape in summer.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Stonehenge druids ‘mark wrong solstice’ | author = Clover, Charles | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1492482/Stonehenge-druids-mark-wrong-solstice.html | accessdate = 2008-04-12 | location=London | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=2005-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cartagena Manifesto''' was written by [[Simón Bolívar]] during the [[Colombia#Independence_from_Spain|Colombian]] and [[Venezuelan War of Independence]], after the fall of the [[First Republic of Venezuela|First Republic]],&lt;ref name="Lemaitre"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lemaitre|first1=Eduardo|title=A Brief History of Cartagena|date=1994|publisher=Compania Litografica Nacional S.A.|location=Medellin|isbn=9789586380928|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; explaining with great detail and precision what he believed to be the causes of this loss. It was written in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]], on 15 December 1812. This is the first of Bolívar's public documents, which due to his later fame as the "Liberator of five nations," have become quite well known. The document contained the conceptual framework of his new agenda, which he then acted out in the field.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Simón Bolívar: A Life|last=Lynch|first=John|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=0300110626|location=New Haven|pages=63-66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the document's publication, Bolívar had been an officer in the Venezuelan army. The First Republic, however, was defeated due to a number of movements that confronted and exploited each other such as the royalists who fought for the old order, the supporters of independence who fought for creole supremacy, and the ''pardos'', blacks, and slaves who fought for their liberation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The conflict was exacerbated by a number of factors such as the shortage of provisions and the effects of the [[1812 Caracas earthquake]], among others. Bolivar started acting on his own, leaving [[La Guaira]] on a Spanish ship. He briefly stayed in [[Curaçao|Curacao]] before finally arriving in Cartagena. he accepted a commission in the army of the  [[United Provinces of New Granada]] (Colombia), which later granted him permission to lead a force to free Venezuela, in what became known as the [[Admirable Campaign]].

== The Manifesto ==
In Cartagena Manifesto, Bolivar outlined a framework that would prevent New Granada from suffering the fate of Venezuela since the territory reproduced the prevailing pattern of colonial dissent from loyal juntas to independent governments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The political, economic, social, and natural causes which Bolívar mentioned included:

*The use of a [[Federalism|federal system]], which Bolivar considered weak for a time of war
*Bad administration of the public income by the republican government
*The [[1812 Caracas earthquake|earthquake of Caracas of 1812]], which worsened the economic and political situation
*The impossibility of establishing a permanent army due to the intransigence of the general population
*The opposing influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which clandestinely promoted anti-republican views

Bolivar advocated a strong central government and powerful executive to avoid infighting between city, state, and national authorities, which in his view created stalemate, dissipating funds and energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Simón Bolívar's Quest for Glory|last=Slatta|first=Richard|last2=De Grummond|first2=Jane|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2003|isbn=1585442399|location=College Station, TX|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that "the government must necessarily adjust itself, so to speak, to the context of the times, men, and circumstances in which it operates. If these are prosperous and serene, it has to be gentle and protective, but if they are calamitous and turbulent, it has to be severe and armed with a strength equal to the dangers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Libertador: Writings of Simón Bolívar|last=Bolivar|first=Simon|last2=Bushnell|first2=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0195144805|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Church reordering''' refers to the rearrangement and adaption of churches to accommodate changes in religious practice. More recently it has been used to describe the introduction of [[Secularity|secular]] uses in under-used places of worship, while retaining their primary purpose as places of worship.&lt;ref name="CCAA Scotland"&gt;[http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/3031/church_interiors.pdf Re-ordering Church Interiors (leaflet)], Committee on Church Art and Architecture, Church of Scotland, 2003 (updated August 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birm"&gt;[http://www.birmingham.anglican.org/upload/pdf/GuidanceReordering.pdf DAC Guidance Notes: Re-ordering], Diocese of Birmingham (undated)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Twenty-first century [[Church (building)|church]] church re-ordering involves the transformation of under-used places of worship by the introduction of secular uses, while retaining their primary purpose as places of worship.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}   use the term to describe the latter.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Church conversions, where large under-used religious buildings have been transformed into other uses, are nothing new.  The impressive [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] Library in Oxford (formerly the city's baroque church of All Saints), the spacious OAP's Day Centre contained within the shell of York's [[Medieval parish churches of York#St Sampson, Church Street|Church of St Sampson]], and the world famous music performance space at [[St John's, Smith Square]] in Westminster, are all English exemplars which pre-date the reordering movement.

In 1977, London's [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] mounted a major exhibition entitled 'Change or Decay', curated by its then Director Sir [[Roy Strong]].  Its central theme was that Britain had too many places of worship and that, because of their architectural significance, many needed to be saved from closure and demolition.  An accompanying book, by [[Marcus Binney]] (co-founder of the conservation pressure group [[SAVE Britain's Heritage]]) and the architect [[Peter Burnham]], illustrated the plight of many of these threatened church buildings, in an era when attrition was severe.  Between 1970 and 2004 the CofE closed 1,630 of its churches; some 85 of these, which were listed buildings, were subsequently demolished.

The national attendance records maintained by the [[Church of England]] (CofE) show that fewer than 2% of the population are regular churchgoers.  Church reordering advocates believe that broader community-based uses of under-used churches could turn the tide.

Though the technique of church reordering has been embraced by many faiths, it is the [[Anglican Communion]] which leads the way.  In England, there are just over 16,000 'active' church buildings, with 14,500 of them owned by the CofE, which as of 2013 spends £100M annually on their maintenance.  Some 12,000 of these churches are 'listed' by [[English Heritage]] as being of architectural significance, with around 4,000 now classified as being [[English Heritage#Purpose and remit|Grade I]] (the highest category).

[[File:Maastricht, Selxyz Dominkanen foto3 2011-01-30 13.06.JPG|thumb|Selexyz bookstore in Maastricht; a conversion from a 13th-century Dominican church]]
Other European countries have tackled the problem of what to do with their unwanted places of worship rather more radically.  In the Dutch town of [[Arnhem]], the former church of St Joseph is now an indoor [[skatepark]], while in [[Maastricht]] the city's 13th century [[:nl:Dominicanenkerk (Maastricht)|Dominican Church]] has been converted (by the Amsterdam-based architects Merckx + Girod) into the award-winning [[Selexyz]] bookstore.

[[Deconsecration]] - where a church building's religious use is officially removed - is a drastic step which many faiths are reluctant to take.  In the five years 2007-12, 123 CofE church buildings were deconsecrated and put to other uses, residential being the largest (22%).  A further 29 were demolished and six were transferred to the [[Churches Conservation Trust]] (CCT) for repair and preservation.  Founded in 1968, the CCT currently cares for 341 English churches.  Its reordering schemes range from the cultural centre in the [[King's Lynn]], Norfolk church of St Nicholas, to [[Circomedia]]'s award-winning training school for aspiring circus trapeze artists in the [[Bristol]] church of [[St Pauls, Bristol|St Paul's]].

In general, the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] hierarchy is opposed to 'mixed-use' conversions, preferring to see its under-used consecrated buildings closed rather than becoming involved with non-worship activities. Nevertheless, several churches in [[Quebec]] have moved to mixed uses. Montreal's [[Church of the Gesù (Montreal)|Church of the Gesù]], while still an active church, is best known as a cultural centre and concert hall, while in rural Quebec, several churches have been partially repurposed, for example by converting the nave into community space but preserving the chancel behind a movable wall which can be opened for services. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nos églises: Un patrimoine à convertir|url=http://www.patrimoine-religieux.qc.ca/fr/telechargement/Patrimoine_a_convertir_Continuite_CPRQ2.pdf|website=Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Québec|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Giles' ''Re-pitching the tent'' is now widely regarded as the definitive guide to reordering, while the American historian Katherine French's study of community life in medieval England (''The People of the Parish'') reveals that activities other than conventional worship would frequently be encountered in many town churches.  People might met to trade, complete business deals or consult lawyers.  [[Scrivener]]s were usually on hand, on the lookout for work.  It is a return to this medieval concept of the church being 'community-based' which is at the heart of the reordering movement.

In Britain, national awards schemes and conferences have helped to promote the reordering movement.  In 2008, the City of London's Mercers Livery Company launched its 'Village Church for Village Life' award, with a first prize of £10,000.  The winner was the parish church of St Phillip &amp; St James at Newton St Philip in [[Somerset]].  In October 2012, at [[Lambeth Palace]] (the London residence of the CofE's Leader, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]), a national conference entitled 'New work in churches' also focussed on church reordering.

==Examples==
[[File:All Saints Church, Hereford - IMG 0023.JPG|thumb|All Saints Church, Hereford]]
One of the most successful church reordering schemes in England is the award-winning conversion of All Saints in the West Midlands cathedral city of Hereford, completed in 1999 and designed by local architect Rod Robinson.  All Saints is the oldest parish church in [[Hereford]] (parts of its interior date back to the late-12th century), yet in 1991 it came perilously close to being closed and deconsecrated.  The solution to the dwindling congregations and spiralling maintenance costs was to 'insert' a café at the west end of the [[nave]], linked to a new mezzanine eating area 'suspended' above the south arcade, and to sacrifice the church's South Chapel, which is now available for commercial lettings such as arts and crafts exhibitions.  Both the central nave and [[chancel]], as well as the [[Lady chapel|Lady Chapel]], are retained as areas of worship.  A new [[vestry]], formed from curved sheets of frosted glass, completes the transformation.  An indication of the success of this radical reordering scheme, which cost £1.7M, is that around 2,000 people pass through Café @ All Saints every week, and church worship attendances have quadrupled.

The [[Diocese of Hereford]] has played a leading role in propagating the ideas of church reordering right across [[Herefordshire]], where 90% of the county's 425 churches are listed.  A dedicated team within the Diocese Office has overseen or advised on 40 church reordering exercises, several of which have won national architectural awards.  Among these are a community centre (shared by five neighbouring parishes) in the 12th-century church of St Andrew's at [[Bridge Sollers]] and St Peter's at [[Peterchurch]], where a village lending library, a children's play area and a space for music recitals have all been seamlessly woven into the fabric of this little [[Norman architecture|Norman]] church.  The latter project won the prestigious national ACE/[[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] design award in 2012.  Both conversions are the work of the Herefordshire practice Communion Design.

The '''confession album''', or '''confession book''',&lt;ref&gt;So called by e. g. A. A. Milne, ''Not that it Matters '', London: Methuen (1921), 79; ''Once a Week '', London: Methuen (1922), 180.&lt;/ref&gt; was a kind of [[autograph book]] popular in late nineteenth century Britain.  Instead of leaving free room for invented or remembered poetry, it provided a formulaic catechism.  The genre died out towards the end of the century, with occasional brief revivals in the twentieth century.  The same kind of form is now found in the Dutch ''vriendenboek'' ("friends  book") and German ''Freundschaftsbuch'' ("friendship book"), used by small children; and the questions that the confession album contained live on in the [[Proust Questionnaire]] often used for celebrity interviews.

==Questions==
The questions posed in a confession album varied from volume to volume.  A typical set of questions, in a book from the 1860s, is given below along with the answers of one respondent (see picture, right). The same set of questions were presented to Queen Victoria's second son, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in 1873,&lt;ref&gt;The earliest dated answer in the album pictured is 1868.  Prince Alfred's answers are given in A.M. Broadley, ''Chats on Autographs'', London: T. Fisher Unwin (1910), 148-51, with the comment: "It is not often that Royalty honours one of those irritating social tortures entitled 'An Album of Confessions to Record Thoughts and Feelings.'" ([https://archive.org/details/chatsonautograph00broaiala online] at archive.org).
&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Marcel Proust]] around 1885 and to [[Claude Debussy]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Touttavoult (1990), 14-17 (Proust) and 138-9 (Debussy).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the questions found in other albums, several seem designed to help courtship, sometimes with a reflection of changing relations between the sexes, for instance "What is your opinion of the girl of the period?", " What is your opinion of the man of the period?"&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (2000), 137-8; 141; 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Britain and America===
[[File:Confessions cover.JPG|right|thumb|The cover of a confession album from the late 1860s]]
The origins of the confession album are unclear. Samantha Matthews notes the similarity to oracle games of the first half of the nineteenth century (she cites examples from 1810 to 1852).  These interactive books, which bore titles such as ''The Young Lady's Oracle: A Fireside Amusement'', included questions that resemble those of the confession albums (for instance "Which is your favourite flower?", "Which is your favourite historical character?"), including sexually distinguished questions appropriate to courtship (for instance, "What is the character of your lady love?", "What is the character of him you love?").&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (2000), 126-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever their origins, confession albums were an established form by the 1860s: Henry d'Ideville records using an album in 1861 (see [[#Germany and France|Germany and France]] below); [[Karl Marx]] filled out answers to one in the spring of 1865 (his favourite colour was red); and [[Friedrich Engels]] answered another in 1868 (his idea of happiness was [[Château Margaux]] 1848).&lt;ref&gt;''Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Collected Works'', London: Lawrence and Wishart, vol. 42 (1987), 567 and 674 (Marx); vol 43 (1988), 541 (Engels). For online transcriptions of the Marx and Engels confessions, and a reproduction of his entry in Jenny's confession book, see [[#External links|External links]]. Marx filled out answers on two other occasions, including one for his daughter Jenny's confession album, the book from which Engels' confession is taken.  Omura et al. (2005) contains a facsimile of this album with some commentary and a (slightly inaccurate) transcription.&lt;/ref&gt; Early albums often had blank pages into which owners would paste the questionnaires; the questions on these could be preprinted or handwritten.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlbecher (2007), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; One such album with handwritten questions, was that of Karl Marx's daughter [[Jenny Longuet|Jenny]], which contains entries dated from 1865 to 1870.  For some of these, she sent the questions to friends, asking them to fill them out and return them.  Her comments in a letter of November 1865 suggest that she regarded the genre as a novelty:&lt;ref&gt;Omura et al. (2005), 24-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have a whole book filled up in that way and the answers are very amusing when compared with one another.  These Confession books have put albums and stamp books quite into the shade.  … I should much like to have answers.  It is more interesting and amusing than a mere Autograph.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the end of the decade, the printed and bound confession book had been introduced.  The earliest currently known example with a printed publication date is ''Mental Photographs'', an album published in New York in 1869, which contained place for a photograph as well as the set of questions (a combination already found in Jenny Marx's album).&lt;ref&gt;R. Saxton (ed.), ''Mental Photographs. An Album for Confessions of Tastes, Habits and Convictions'' New York: Leypoldt &amp; Holt (1869). See Kolhbecher (2007), 25-6; 28-9; 32. The questions elicited a satirical response from [[Mark Twain]], "Mental Photographs", published in ''Mark Twain's Sketches'', London: Routledge (1872), 148-9 ([https://archive.org/details/marktwainssketc00clemgoog online] at archive.org).&lt;/ref&gt; The albums seem to have enjoyed their greatest popularity in the following decades, but to have become unfashionable by the early years of the twentieth century.  At their height, confession albums were widespread enough that in 1883 [[Douglas Sladen]] could rely on readers' familiarity with the form to play on it with a poetical answer.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. B. Sladen, "A Confession. (Written for a Lady's Character Book)" in ''Australian Lyrics'', Melbourne and Sydney: George Robertson (1883), 39-40. The poem is quoted and discussed in Matthews (2000), 139-40.&lt;/ref&gt; He begins:&lt;blockquote&gt;
My favorite  virtue, I confess, is chivalrous devotedness,&lt;br /&gt;
My favorite quality in man, the manful genius that can&lt;br /&gt;
With iron will and eye sublime, up to the heights of empire climb;&lt;br /&gt;
Although in woman, as I think, gentleness is perfection's pink
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This ubiquity was accompanied by a certain exasperation.  In a novel of 1886, a character asks:&lt;ref&gt;Annie G. Savigny, ''A heart-song of to-day (disturbed by fire from the 'unruly member')'', Toronto: Hunter Rose (1886), Chapter 31 ([http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7184 online] at Project Gutenberg).&lt;/ref&gt; "''A propos'' of the confessional, did any of you ever come under the torture of that modern Inquisition, the 'Confession Book?'"  Early twentieth century writers look back on the books as a long unfashionable genre.  A writer in 1915 records:&lt;ref&gt;C.F. ''Really &amp; Truly: A Book of Literary Confessions: Designed by a Late-Victorian'' London: Arthur L. Humphreys (1915), 7, cited in Matthews (2000), 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
So far as I can recollect it was voted a bore at the end of the 'seventies and, except in suburban homes, such as my own, was never referred to except with a yawn or a smile after the early eighties.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;The ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'' in 1906 remarks:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' s.v. "confession" III.9 and in Matthews (2000), 132; similarly Jerome K. Jerome, ''Idle Ideas in 1905'' London: Hurst &amp; Brackett (1905), 25, speculates about a future revival of the "old confession book".&lt;/ref&gt; "'If not yourself, who would you rather be?' was a favourite question of the confession album of the seventies." [[A. A. Milne]] (1882–1956) looked back in 1921 on the album as something from his childhood:&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Milne, ''Not that it Matters'', London: Methuen (1921), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The confession-book, I suppose, has disappeared. It is twenty years since I have seen one. As a boy I told some inquisitive owner what was my favourite food (porridge, I fancy), my favourite hero in real life and in fiction, my favourite virtue in woman, and so forth.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some album producers saw [[World War I]] as an opportunity to revive the confession book.  The new albums, unlike their Victorian predecessors, ignored questions appropriate to courtship.  They were clearly intended to be filled out by soldiers, a point spelt out in the title of one: ''My Brave Friend's Confession Book'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (2000), 132; 147-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany and France===
According to Henry d'Ideville, he had an "album-questionnaire" in which he collected the responses of friends and acquaintances in 1861, when as a diplomat in Naples he took the answers of [[Urbano Rattazzi]] and [[Laetitia Marie Wyse Bonaparte|Mme de Solms]], which he reproduces.  His account, written in 1872, explains the nature of the album, as though he did not expect readers to be familiar with it:&lt;ref&gt;H. d'Ideville, ''Journal d'un diplomate en Italie, Notes intimes pour servir à l'historie du second empire, Turin 1859-1862'', Paris: Hachette, 1872, 101 "Voici en quoi consiste l'opération: On adresse au malheureux interrogé une série de questions auxquelles il doit répondre successivement. – Quel poëte? quelle occupation? quel plaisir? quelle sensation, etc., etc., préférez-vous? Les réponses sont inscrites, puis la personne signe, date son interrogatoire et le tour est joué."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here is what the operation consists of: you pose a series of questions to the unfortunate subject of the interrogation and he has to answer them one after the other. – What poet, what painter, what occupation, what pleasure, what sensation, etc. etc. do you prefer? The answers are written down, then the person signs and dates his interrogation and that's the game over.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

British confession albums also circulated on the continent (see [[#Questions|Questions]] above), and (perhaps in imitation of them) there were also questionnaire books in other languages.  In Germany there were several, notably ''Erkenne Dich Selbst!'' ("Know Yourself"), which first appeared in 1878 and survived to around 1900, going through at least 22 impressions, produced by Friedrich Kirchner (1848–1900). The ''Leipziger Illustrirte Zeitung'', which belonged to the same publishers as Kirchner's album, set his questions to celebrities, a forerunner of the modern use as the [[#Proust Questionnaire|Proust Questionnaire]]; facsimiles of these answers were in turn printed in the album. In France, two are known, both containing the word ''Confidences'' in the title to represent the English "confessions".  Here too the ''Revue illustrée'' set confession album questions to the famous, including Zola and Verlaine.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlbecher (2007), 28-9; 33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revivals==

===Friendship books===
In the Netherlands, where autograph books are very popular among young schoolchildren, publishers have recently started bringing out an alternative in the so-called ''vriendenboek'' or ''vriendjesboek'' ("Friends book"), which much like the confession album come preprinted with a set of questions about the respondents' hobbies, idols and wishes.  Some children prefer the new format, which says more about the person answering, but most prefer the traditional autograph book, which leaves more room for their own creativity.&lt;ref&gt;M. Van den Berg, "Zur Erinnerung, Poesiealben aus Flandern", ''Acta Ethnographica Hungarica'' 44 (1999), 247-59 (on this point 249).&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern German ''Freundschaftsbuch'' ("Friendship book") has the same kind of preprinted questions and is typically aimed at the same age group.&lt;ref&gt;For instance ''Pettersson und Findus - Alle meine Freunde'', illustrated by Sven Nordquist, Oetinger (2005), {{ISBN|978-3-7891-1330-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, [[Marcel Proust]], then a child of fourteen, filled out the answers to an English confession album, which bore the title ''Confessions. An Album to Record Thoughts, Feelings, &amp;c.'' (his answers were auctioned in 2003 for $34,000).&lt;ref&gt;L. Van Gelder, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/05/theater/arts-briefing.html Arts briefing]", ''New York Times'', May 5, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in Proust led to a later revival of the questions as a kind of formulaic interview for celebrities, first by Léonce Peillard in France in the 1950s, later in French and American television and in the magazine of the German ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', starting in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Kohlbecher (2007), 25; 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' since 1993, under the name of "The Proust Questionnaire", which disguises its unintellectual British origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/archives/features/proust "Proust Questionnaire"].&lt;/ref&gt; This use too had been anticipated by nineteenth century journals (see [[#Germany and France|Germany and France]]).

===Slam Books===
{{main article|Slam book}}
A slam book is a notebook (commonly the spiral-bound type) which is passed among children and teenagers. The keeper of the book starts by posing a question (which may be on any subject) and the book is then passed round for each contributor to fill in their own answer to the question

'''Copy editing''' (also '''copyediting''', sometimes abbreviated '''ce''') is the process of reviewing and correcting written material to improve accuracy, readability, and fitness for its purpose, and to ensure that it is free of error, omission, inconsistency, and repetition.&lt;ref name="What is copy editing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stainton|first1=Elsie Myers|title=The Fine Art of Copyediting|date=2002|publisher=Columbia University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAeT5hN1XfAC|accessdate=21 February 2017|isbn=9780231124782}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of publication in print, copy editing is done before [[typesetting]] and again before [[proofreading]], the final step in the editorial cycle.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|1–5|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref name="What is copy editing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfep.org.uk/about/faqs/what-is-copy-editing/ |title= What Is Copy Editing? |accessdate= March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Canada, an editor who does this work is called a ''copy editor''. An organization's highest-ranking copy editor, or the supervising editor of a group of copy editors, may be known as the ''copy chief'', ''copy desk chief'', or ''news editor''. In book publishing in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world that follow British [[nomenclature]], the term ''copy editor'' is used, but in newspaper and magazine publishing, the term is '''''subeditor''''' (or '''''sub-editor'''''), commonly shortened to ''sub''. The senior subeditor of a publication is frequently called the ''chief subeditor''. As the prefix ''sub'' suggests, copy editors typically have less authority than regular editors.&lt;ref&gt;Lozano, George A. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.2401 Ethics of Using Language Editing Services in an Era of Digital Communication and Heavily Multi-Authored Papers]. Retrieved 24 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the Internet, online copy refers to the text content of web pages. Similar to print, online copy editing is the process of revising the raw or draft text of web pages and reworking it to make it ready for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparkleweb.org/copy-editing-ux|title=Copy Editing Services in Chennai.|website=www.sparkleweb.org|access-date=2016-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528190011/http://www.sparkleweb.org/copy-editing-ux|archive-date=2016-05-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copy editing has three levels: light, medium, and heavy. Depending on the budget and scheduling of the publication, the publisher will let the copy editor know what level of editing to employ. The type of editing one chooses (light, medium, or heavy) will help the copy editor prioritize their efforts.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|12}}

Within copy editing, there is mechanical editing and substantive editing: mechanical editing is the process of making a text or manuscript follow editorial or house style, keeping the preferred style and grammar rules of publication consistent across all content. It refers to editing in terms of spelling, punctuation, and correct usage of grammatical symbols, along with reviewing special elements like tables, charts, formatting footnotes, and endnotes. [[Content editing]], also known as substantive editing, is the editing of material, including its structure and organization, to correct internal inconsistencies and discrepancies. Content editing may require heavy editing or rewriting as compared to mechanical editing.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|5–10}}

In addition, copy editing may change punctuation, spelling and usage for a different country. For a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] readership, the American spelling of "organize" may be changed to "organise", and "color" changed to "colour".

== Practices ==
=== Mechanical editing ===
Mechanical editing is the process of proofreading a piece of writing for consistency, either internally or in accordance with the publisher's house style. According to Einsohn, mechanical editors work with such things as the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Einsohn |first=Amy |title=The Copyeditor's Handbook: A Guide for Book Publishing and Corporate Communications, with Exercises and Answer Keys |year=2011 |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0-520-27156-2 | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=hbMwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | quote= The heart of copyediting consists of making a manuscript conform to an ''editorial style'' (also called ''house style''). Editorial style includes: &lt;br/&gt; spelling &lt;br/&gt; hyphenation &lt;br/&gt; capitalization &lt;br/&gt; punctuation &lt;br/&gt; treatment of numbers and numerals &lt;br/&gt;treatment of quotations &lt;br/&gt; use of abbreviations and acronyms &lt;br/&gt; use of italics and bold type &lt;br/&gt; treatment of special elements (headings, lists, tables, charts, and graphs) &lt;br/&gt; format of footnotes or endnotes and other documentation. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Abbreviations and acronyms
* Additional elements, such as charts, tables, and graphs
* Capitalization
* Footnotes and endnotes
* Hyphenation
* Italicization and boldfaced type
* Numbers and numerals
* Punctuation
* Quotations
* Spelling

Gilad also mentions the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilad |first=Suzanne |title=Copyediting &amp; Proofreading for Dummies |year=2007 |page=50 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-470-12171-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=April 2016}}
* Charts, graphs, maps, and their keys
* Initialisms
* Page numbers, headers, and footers
* Tables of contents and page numbers
* Underscoring

Proper spelling and punctuation are subjective in some cases, where they must be left to the discretion of the copyeditor or the publisher. Most publishing firms use a widely recognized style manual such as ''The Chicago Manual of Style'' or ''The Associated Press Stylebook''. Companies that produce documents and reports but do not consider themselves publishers in the usual sense, tend to rely on in-house style guides or on the judgment of the copyeditor.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

=== Grammar and usage ===
The goal of the copyeditor is to enforce inviolable rules while respecting personal stylistic preferences. This can be difficult, as some writers view grammatical corrections of the copyedited manuscript as a challenge to their intellectual ability or professional identity. For this reason, copy editors are encouraged to side with the author. If the author's preference is acceptable, it should be respected. This practice is complicated further by constantly evolving language conventions as recorded by books on grammar and usage. Additionally, the authors of such books often disagree.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|333–337}}

=== Content editing ===
Content editing consists of reorganizing or restructuring the content of a document. This involves any inconsistent parts of the content as well as any variances. Copyeditors can either fix the content by rewriting it or heavily editing it. However, the copyeditor will often point out any difficult passages for the author to resolve on his or her own time.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

Although copyeditors are not responsible for factual correctness of the document, they can provide comments for the author on any information they know to be incorrect,&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|9}} such as year discrepancies or misleading ideas. This type of fact checking is acceptable for copyeditors that know the document's subject matter.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|7–10}}

The copyeditor must also point out any biased language without infringing on the author's meaning. This includes material "that might form the basis for a lawsuit alleging libel, invasion of privacy, or obscenity". Some see censoring biased language as [[political correctness]], so it is important the copyeditor distinguishes between the two.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|7–10}} To do this, the copyeditor will permit intentional "politically incorrect" views and censor only marginalized, offensive, or exclusive language.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|405}}

=== Correlating parts, typecoding, and permissions ===
Most [[manuscript]]s will require the copyeditor to correlate the parts within it. Copyeditors must carry out the following tasks in this process:&lt;ref name="einsohn2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Einsohn |first=Amy |title=The Copyeditor's Handbook: A Guide for Book Publishing and Corporate Communications, with Exercises and Answer Keys |year=2011 |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0-520-27156-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Verify any [[cross-reference]]s that appear in the text
* Check the numbering of footnotes, endnotes, tables, and illustrations
* Specify the placement of tables and illustrations
* Check the content of the illustrations against the captions and the text
* Read the list of illustrations against the illustrations and captions
* Read the [[table of contents]] against the manuscript
* Read the footnotes/endnotes and in-text citations against the [[bibliography]]
* Check the alphabetization of the bibliography or reference list
 
Some manuscripts may require special cross-checking. For example, in a how-to text, a copyeditor might need to verify that the list of equipment or parts matches the instructions given within the text.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
 
Typecoding is the process of identifying which sections of the manuscript are not regular running text. These portions of text, known as elements, include the following:&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|10}}
* Part and chapter numbers
* Titles and subtitles
* Headings and subheadings
* Lists
* Extracts
* Displayed equations
* Table numbers
* Source lines
* Footnotes
* Figure numbers and captions

It is the copyeditor's job to typecode (or make note of) all manuscript elements for the publication designer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160508130210/http://www.cyranoworks.com/documents/Editinglevels.pdf Cyranoworks.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Hard copy copyeditors are usually asked to pencil in the typecodes in the left margin of the manuscript. On-screen copyeditors may be asked to insert typecodes at the beginning and end of each element.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

Finally, if the manuscript contains long quotations from a published work that is still under [[copyright]], the copyeditor should remind the author to acquire permission to [[reprint]] said quotations. The same goes for the reprinting of tables, charts, graphs, and illustrations that have appeared in print. Rules vary for the reproduction of unpublished materials (letters, diaries, etc.)&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

== Processes ==
There are several basic procedures that every copyeditor must follow: copyeditors need a system for marking changes to the author's text (marking), a process for querying the author and the editorial coordinator ([[question|querying]]), a method for keeping track of editorial decisions (recordkeeping), and procedures for incorporating the author's review of the copyediting into a final manuscript or electronic files (cleanup). These systems were originally developed in an era before that of the computer, but over time these procedures were adapted to exist in a digital on-screen space.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|7–10}}

Each medium (in print and on screen) has its own affordances, and although a copyeditor may prefer one editing process over the other, copyeditors are practically required to use both techniques.

=== Hard-copy editing ===
Traditional markup copy editing, or hard-copy editing, is still important because screening tests for employment are administered in hard copy. Also, the author whose text the copy editor is editing may prefer hard-copy markup, and copy editors need to know traditional markup in case documents and materials cannot be exchanged electronically. When editing in hard-copy, all participating parties (the editor, author, typesetter, and proofreader) must understand the marks the copy editor makes, and therefore a universal marking system that signifies these changes exists. This is also why the copy editor should write legibly and neatly. Copy editors working hard-copy write their corrections in the text directly, leaving the margins for querying. Usually the copy editor is asked to write in a bright color, so the author and other parties can easily recognize the editor's changes.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|7–10}}

=== On-screen editing ===
Every year, more editing projects are being done on computer and fewer in print. Also, if there is a digital version of a text the copyeditor is editing, they can more easily search words, run spellcheckers, and generate clean copies of messy pages. The first thing copyeditors must do when editing on-screen is to copy the author's files, as the original document must be preserved.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|7–10}} Each word processing program provides various options for how an editor's markups are shown on screen and on the printout. On-screen editing mainly differs from hard-copy editing in the fact that the copyeditor should edit more cleanly on-screen, refraining from saving parts of words, and be careful in maintaining proper line spacing.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|7–10}}

=== Querying ===
Copyeditors often need to query their authors in order to address questions, comments, or explanations: most of these can be done in the margins of the text, or the comment section when on-screen.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|7–10}} The copyeditor must consider when to query and the length and tone of their queries, as querying too frequently or infrequently, cryptically, or sarcastically can result in a negative relationship between the copyeditor and the author.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|7–10}}

== Goals ==
Depending on which publication a copyeditor is employed with, his or her goals may change, however there are a few constituencies that must always be served – the author (the person who wrote or compiled the manuscript), the publisher (the person or company that is paying to produce the material), and the readers (the audience for whom the material is being produced). These parties (in conjunction with the copyeditor) work to achieve the same goal, which is to produce an error free publication. The copyeditor strives to improve clarity, coherency, consistency, and correctness – otherwise known as the "4 C's". Each of these components serve the copyeditor's "Cardinal C", which is communication.&lt;ref name="einsohn2011" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

== History ==
The advent of the printing press in the middle of the 15th century opened the doors to the first printing houses in Europe. Even after the invention of the printing press and on to today, the editor's job is to correct perceived mistakes. Within these printing houses, there were a variety of employees, one being correctors, or as it is referred to today, editors.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
 
The biggest difference between monastic copyists and copyeditors is that copyeditors leave editions as suggestions that the original author can choose to reject. These printing houses established procedures for editing, preparing the text, and proofreading. Specialist correctors made sure texts were in accordance with the standards of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hellinga, Lotte (2009). ''The Gutenberg Revolutions A Companion to the History of the Book'', p. 211.Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford. {{ISBN|9781405192781}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Before the printing press, monastic copyists altered words or phrases they thought were odd, under the assumption that the copyist before them had made a mistake. This is what led to so much variety in standard texts like the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mmmporium.com/copyreading|title=Copy Editing|accessdate=5 April 2016|date=16 October 2016|publisher=MMMporium}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the globalization of the book from 1800 to 1970, the rise of American authors and editors came to fruition. One editor in particular, Maxwell Perkins, was sought out by writers such as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Wolfe because he greatly improved the work on these prominent authors with his editorial eye. Perkins was known editing, guiding, and befriending his writers – but the times were changing.&lt;ref name="Luey, Beth 2009 p. 369"&gt;Luey, Beth (2009). ''Modernity and Print III: The United States 1890-1970 A Companion to the History of the Book'', p. 369.Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford. {{ISBN|9781405192781}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the late 19th century, the role of an editor was to decide if a manuscript was good enough to be published. As time passed, the role of an editor and [[publisher]] became more distant. Although there was a newfound relationship between editors and authors, thoughtful editing did not end.&lt;ref name="Luey, Beth 2009 p. 369"/&gt;
 
Copyeditors were employed at various publishing houses, magazines, journals, and by private authors seeking revisions on their work. Some copyeditors were even employed by [[public relations]] and [[advertising]] firms who valued strong editing practices in their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrigan|first1=Jane R.|last2=Dunlap|first2=Karen Brown|title=The Editorial Eye|date=2003|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|isbn=9780312152703|page=387|edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The symbols used by copyeditors today are based on those that have been used by proofreaders since the beginnings of publishing, though they have undergone some changes over time. However, the exact beginnings of the copyediting language used today are unclear. Despite its long history, copyediting as a practice has not experienced any extreme upheaval other than the desktop publishing revolution of the 1980s. This phenomenon began as the result of a series of inventions that were released during the middle of this decade, and refers to the growth of technology usage in the field of copyediting.&lt;ref name="History Design."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designtalkboard.com/design-articles/desktoppublishing.php  |title=History of Desktop Publishing |publisher=DesignTalk |access-date= March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book Publishing."&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.bookediting.ca/timeline.html |title=Book Editing Looks at Developments in the History of Book Printing and Publishing |publisher=The Authors Guild |access-date=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namely, the development of the [[Macintosh]] computer, the desktop laser printer by Hewlett-Packard, and a software for desktop publishing called [[PageMaker]] created by Aldus (a company now under the control of Adobe)  allowed the revolution to begin.&lt;ref name="History Design." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3401200365.html |title=Desktop Publishing |author= Allen Renear |publisher= The Gale Group Inc. |year=2002 |access-date= March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing both individuals and publishing agencies alike to cheaply and effectively begin to edit compositions entirely on-screen rather than by hand, desktop publishing revolution morphed copyediting into the practice it is today. Most copyeditors today rely on more modern WYSIWYG ('what you see is what you get') text processors such as Microsoft Word that are based on the original PageMaker to do their work.
 
There were a few events that led to changes within copyediting as a career. One of these, the successful strike of the editorial department of the Newark Ledger from November 17, 1934 to March 28, 1935, was "the first major action of its kind by any local guild...[it] both confirmed the irreversibility of the guilds' movement away from the professional association idea and greatly accelerated that process".&lt;ref name="Toward Unionization: The American Newspaper Guild and the Newark  Ledger Strike of 1934–35."&gt;{{cite web |title=Toward Unionization: The American Newspaper Guild and the Newark Ledger Strike of 1934-35 |author=Daniel J. Leab |publisher=Tamiment Institute |access-date=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paired with another string of strikes led by The New York Newspaper Guild against a number of smaller newspapers in the summer of 1934, these actions served to shift the image of the editorial worker as a 'professional' to one as an average citizen.&lt;ref name="Toward Unionization: The American Newspaper Guild and the Newark  Ledger Strike of 1934–35." /&gt;  Another strike from the year 1934 was the strike at the Macaulay Company, reportedly the first ever strike to occur at a publishing firm. At the conclusion of the second Macaulay strike,which occurred three months after the first, the nationwide drive towards unionization had entered the publishing industry and was "sweeping through all the major publishing houses".&lt;ref name="Women Writers in the United States: A Timeline of Literary, Cultural, and Social History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yqi0x7BEvCoC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;dq=macaulay+newspaper+strike+1934&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=61GqHL-Em7&amp;sig=7C0Ugv1IO3P3SisBPQpM-U4swvo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHqO3E883LAhUFbSYKHbweDVYQ6AEINDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=macaulay%20newspaper%20strike%201934&amp;f=false |title=Women Writers in the United States: A Timeline of Literary, Cultural, and Social History |author=Cynthia J. Davis, Kathryn West |publisher=Oxford UP |year= 2006 |access-date=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these events seemed to have the secondary result of lowering the status of editors across the various publishing fields, it could be said that they sparked the decline of copyeditors that can be seen across the publishing fields today.
 
Owing to the rise of the [[Digital Age]], the roles and responsibilities of a copyeditor have changed. For instance, beginning in 1990, copyeditors learned pagination electronically.&lt;ref name= "digital age"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Avery-Ahlijian|first=Angela Anne. |date=2011|title=Copy Editing in the Digital Age: How Technology Has Changed Copy Editing |publisher=Eastern Michigan University |url=http://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1252&amp;context=honors}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} They could now look at different pages of a text on multiple screens and easily edit on there, as opposed to pasting them by hand on a board. This technological advance also required that copyeditors learn new software such as Pagemaker, [[Quark Xpress]], and now [[Adobe InDesign]].

Modern copyeditors are often required to edit for digital as well as print versions of text. Digital copyediting requires copyeditors to understand [[RSS feed]]s, [[social media]] such as Twitter and Facebook, and [[Hyper Text Markup Language]].&lt;ref name="digital age" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} What should be accounted for is that in this digital age, information is constantly being released which then leads to the decline in editing of the online versions. Editors of the website Buzzfeed commented that sometimes they "simply can't get every post before it's published".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajr.org/2014/05/13/copy-editors-digital-media/ |title=Copy Editors Carve Niche in Digital Media Landscape |author= Dan Appenfeller |date= May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While copyeditors still do traditional tasks such as checking for facts, grammar, style, and writing headlines, some of their duties have been pushed aside to make way for technology. Some copyeditors now have to design page layouts and some even edit video content. Copyeditors are now sometimes referred to as "copy/layout editors" or "producers/designers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copydesk.org/blog/2013/06/01/editing-job-losses/ |title=A look at the numbers: Editing job losses in the newsroom |author=Fred Vultee |date=June 1, 2013 |access-date=April 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809022924/http://www.copydesk.org/blog/2013/06/01/editing-job-losses/ |archive-date=August 9, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Changes in the field ==
[[File:Example of copyedited manuscript.jpg|thumb|Example of non-professional copy editing in progress]] 
Traditionally, the copy editor would read a [[printing|printed]] or written manuscript, manually marking it with editor's correction marks. At sizable newspapers, the main copy desk was often U-shaped; the copy desk chief sat in the "slot" (the center space of the U) and was known as the "slot man", while copy editors were arrayed around him or her on the outside of the U, known as the "rim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theslot.com/slotman.html |title=What's a slot man? |author=Bill Walsh |work=The Slot |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, copy editors were sometimes known humorously as "rim rats". Chief copy editors are still sometimes called "the slot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/26/AR2007102601865.html |title=The Power and Perils of Headlines |author=Deborah Howell |date=October 28, 2007 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But nowadays, the manuscript is more often read on a [[computer display]] and text corrections are entered directly.

The nearly universal adoption of computerized systems for editing and layout in newspapers and magazines has also led copy editors to become more involved in design and the technicalities of production. Technical knowledge is therefore sometimes considered as important as writing ability, though this is truer in journalism than it is in [[book publishing]]. Hank Glamann, co-founder of the [[American Copy Editors Society]], made the following observation about ads for copy editor positions at American newspapers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We want them to be skilled grammarians and wordsmiths and write bright and engaging headlines and must know Quark. But, often, when push comes to shove, we will let every single one of those requirements slide except the last one, because you have to know that in order to push the button at the appointed time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asne.org/index.cfm?ID=3836 |title=Workshop: Keeping your copy editors happy |accessdate=2 January 2009 |date=7 August 2002 |publisher=The American Society of Newspaper Editors |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207193451/http://www.asne.org/index.cfm?ID=3836 |archivedate=7 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Traits, skills, and training==
Besides an excellent command of language, copy-editors need broad general knowledge for spotting factual errors; good critical thinking skills in order to recognize inconsistencies or vagueness; interpersonal skills for dealing with writers, other editors and designers; attention to detail; and a sense of style. Also, they must establish priorities and balance a desire for perfection with the necessity to follow deadlines.

Many copy editors have a college degree, often in journalism, the language the text is written in, or communications. In the United States, copy editing is often taught as a college journalism course, though its name varies. The courses often include news design and [[pagination]].

In the United States, The Dow Jones Newspaper Fund sponsors internships that include two weeks of training. Also, the American Press Institute, the [[Poynter Institute]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], UC San Diego Extension and conferences of the American Copy Editors Society offer mid-career training for newspaper copy editors and news editors (news copy desk supervisors).

Most US newspapers and publishers give copy-editing job candidates an editing test or a tryout. These vary widely and can include general items such as acronyms, current events, math, punctuation, and skills such as the use of [[AP Stylebook|Associated Press style]], headline writing, info graphics editing, and [[journalism ethics]].

In both the US and the UK, there are no official bodies offering a single recognized qualification.

In the UK, several companies provide a range of courses unofficially recognized within the industry. Training may be on the job or through publishing courses, privately run seminars, or correspondence courses of the Society for Editors&lt;ref name="SfEP"&gt;{{cite web|title=society for editors and proofreaders|url=https://www.sfep.org.uk/training/choose-a-course/|website=Society for Editors and Proofreaders|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Proofreaders. The [[National Council for the Training of Journalists]] also has a qualification for subeditors.

== Contemporary ==
Before the digital era, copy-editors used to take a red pen to a piece of paper to point out errors and inconsistencies using a markup language made up of symbols universally known by copy-editors. The traditional copy editor was once defined as editing for grammar, spelling, punctuation and other mechanics of style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.editors.ca/hire/definitions.html |title=Definitions of editorial skills |accessdate=5 April 2016|publisher=Editors' Association of Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Copy editing symbols can no longer be used when editing digitally because they are not supported on digital platforms such as track changes. With more posting online and less printing on paper, this means current publishing processes are faster. Hard copy is no longer able to keep up with digital publishing.&lt;ref name="Eastern Michigan University"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1252&amp;context=honors | title=Copy Editing in the Digital Age: How Technology Has Changed Copy Editing | accessdate=5 April 2016|date= 2011 |publisher=Eastern Michigan University }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a publisher to hire copy editors to print hard copy, make edits, and then make changes is no longer the most efficient process. The position of copy editors is at risk because time demands quicker results that can be done by automatic correction software that catches grammatical errors.&lt;ref name="American Journalism Review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ajr.org/2014/04/15/copy-editors-in-digital-world/ | title=Will Automated Copy Editors Replace Human Ones? | accessdate=5 April 2016|date= 14 April 2014 |publisher=American Journalism Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transferring the responsibility from human copy editors to digital software has been adopted by some publishing companies because it is available free of cost.
 
Professionals feared that the introduction of digital editing software would put an end to copyediting careers. Copy editors are still employed and needed for heavy editing, such as fact-checking and content organization, which software is not yet able to do. With grammar software and journalists that can edit, copy editors are seen as a luxury in publishing.&lt;ref name="American Journalism Review"/&gt; The potential for a company to use editing software may also require the copy editor to only perform heavy editing and querying. Though the steps for copyediting are the same, the execution is what has been changed due to the introduction of digital environments.

The technological development of Cloud storage allows contemporary copy editors and writers to upload and share files across multiple devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coolheadtech.com/blog/four-differences-between-google-drive-and-dropbox | title=Four Differences Between Google Drive and Dropbox |accessdate=5 April 2016|date= 23 October 2013 |publisher=Coolhead Tech }}&lt;/ref&gt; Online word processors such as Google Docs, Dropbox, Zoho, OpenGoo and Buzzword allow users to perform a number of tasks. Each processor has its advantages and disadvantages based on the users' preferences, but primarily allow users to share, edit and collaborate on documents.&lt;ref name="Make Use Of"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-great-alternatives-to-google-docs-you-should-consider/ | title= 5 Great Alternatives to Google Docs You Should Consider |accessdate=5 April 2016|date= 26 October 2009 |publisher=Make Use Of }}&lt;/ref&gt; On Google Docs users can invite others via e-mail to view, comment and edit any file of their choosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://support.google.com/docs/answer/49008?hl=en | title=Overview of Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides |accessdate=5 April 2016 |publisher=Google }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those invited can view and edit the document together in real time.&lt;ref name="Google"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://support.google.com/docs/answer/49008?hl=en |title=Overview of Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides |accessdate=5 April 2016 |publisher=Google }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Google Docs whose files can only be shared through the web app, Dropbox shares from a desktop app.&lt;ref name="Eastern Michigan University"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Google"/&gt; Dropbox users can share documents as links or as shared folders.&lt;ref name="Make Use Of"/&gt; Users can create shared folders and add others to the folder.&lt;ref name="Make Use Of"/&gt; Files in a shared folder will appear in the other user's Dropbox and all involved users receive notifications when edits are made to a file in the folder.&lt;ref name="Make Use Of"/&gt;  Adobe's Buzzword allows users to share files, with the user's choice from varying levels of editing access, and includes a Version History feature which tracks changes made to documents and lets users revert to earlier versions.&lt;ref name="Google"/&gt; 
Useful in many word processors, a Track Changes feature allows users to make changes to a document and view them separately from the original document. In Microsoft Word users can choose whether to show or hide changes by clicking Track Changes under the Review ribbon.&lt;ref name="Track changes while you edit"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Track-changes-while-you-edit-024158a3-7e62-4f05-8bb7-dc3ecf0295c4 |title=Track changes while you edit |accessdate=5 April 2016|publisher=Google }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those editing documents can leave comments by clicking wherever the user desires to leave a comment and clicking New Comment under the review ribbon or by highlighting text and clicking New Comment.&lt;ref name="Track changes while you edit"/&gt;  Users can select the revision of specific users whom they have allowed to revise their work and choose which level of mark ups to view under the Show Markup dropdown menu in the Review ribbon.&lt;ref name="Track changes while you edit"/&gt;  Users can also choose to accept or reject changes by clicking either Accept or Reject in the Review Ribbon.&lt;ref name="Track changes while you edit"/&gt;

=== Contemporary copy-editor ===
The field of copy-editing is not obsolete. Teresa Schmedding, president of the American Copy Editors Society (ACES) and a deputy managing editor at the Daily Herald in Chicago, thinks that copyeditors are "a natural fit" for digital journalism and social media because though publishing has been made available to almost anyone, quality and credibility is brought to content only by copy editors.&lt;ref name="Track changes while you edit"/&gt; 
 
When editing a piece, copy editors now have to consider multimedia aspects of the story. The inclusion of video, images, SEO, and audio are just some of the components that are now created and included to digital publications by copy editors.&lt;ref name="Track changes while you edit"/&gt;  Digital journalism has created many new roles for a copy editor, such as editing on the Web. Digital editing now requires copy editors to become familiar with [[search engine optimization]], understanding HyperText Markup Language, [[Cascading Style Sheets]], and RSS feeds.&lt;ref name="Track changes while you edit"/&gt;  In addition to Web-based skills, contemporary copy editors must also obtain a larger skill set, having knowledge of and the ability to operate software such as Adobe Illustrator for generating graphics or Adobe Dreamweaver for designing web pages.

=== Issues ===
One of the problems with copy-editing is that it may slow the publication of text. With the digital publishing era came an increased demand for a fast turnover of information. Additional details such as color printing, page size, and layout are determined by the allotted budget.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Web-based publications, such as BuzzFeed and Slate, do not have enough room in their budgets to keep a sufficient number of staff to edit their massive, daily rushes of content. Because of this, copy chief Emmy Favila says lower-priority posts are published without copy edits at Buzzfeed.&lt;ref name="ajr.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ajr.org/2014/05/13/copy-editors-digital-media/ |title= Copy Editors Carve Niche in Digital Media Landscape |accessdate=5 April 2016|date= 13 May 2014|publisher=American Journalism Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slate does not edit its blog posts before publication, but all of its news articles are copy edited before publication, say Slate copy chief Lowen Liu and deputy editor Julia Turner.&lt;ref name="ajr.org" /&gt; 
 
In response to such high demands for fast-produced content, some online publications have started publishing articles first and then editing later, a process known as back-editing. Editors prioritize stories to edit based on traffic and whether the content was originally reported for needing edits.

Reading material has become increasingly accessible to users with a wide range of disabilities. Carolyn Rude exemplifies such cases in alternatively replacing illustrations with text and audio translations for the visually impaired.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60188071|title=Technical editing|last=D.|first=Rude, Carolyn|date=2006|publisher=Longman|others=Dayton, David., Maylath, Bruce.|isbn=032133082X|edition= 4th|location=New York|oclc=60188071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rude also suggests that web developers attempt to stick to print guidelines, such as "clear and simple language and consistent terms and navigation devices", especially when readers are looking at text in a second language.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Effects of the Internet==

As online resources rise in popularity, copy editors endeavor to meet the increase of digital consumerism to the best of their abilities, and such high competition has resulted in a gradually "declining of quality in editing", such as proofreading grammatical errors or fact checking.&lt;ref name="digital age" /&gt; However, this doesn't mean the Internet has limited the scope of a copy editor's responsibilities or job opportunities. One of the most important advancements of the digital age is the advent of pagination, which gives copy editors more control over the construction and revisions of their content. Pagination is a convenient feature in programs such as "Pagemaker, the Quark Xpress, and AdobeIndesign".&lt;ref name="digital age" /&gt; Despite the increasing number of programs, however, some copy editors believe their basic functions and duties haven't changed much. Other copy editors think the Internet has simplified the process of fact checking and online programs such as Facebook or Twitter have also expedited the process of information-gathering. Other digital skills, such as image selection and search-engine optimization, increase the visibility of search results, especially when searching for keywords in headlines.

In all likelihood, the Internet will continue to evolve, but this shouldn't hamper the overall importance of copy editing. Although it may be tempting to neglect proper revisions in favor of convenience, the credibility and quality of an editor's work should still be maintained, as there will always be updates in software and technology.&lt;ref name="digital age" /&gt; As formats evolve, so too will the opportunities for journalists and other writers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11914">A '''dance squad''' or '''dance team''', sometimes called a '''pom squad''' or '''song team''', is a team of participants that participates in [[competitive dance]]. In a routine, a squad will incorporate a specific dance style (i.e. [[hip hop]],  [[jazz]], or [[lyrical dance|lyrical]]), technical work (leaps, turns, kicks, splits, jumps), and, depending on the routine, [[pom-pom]]s and/or [[cheering|cheers]]. A pom squad slightly differs from a regular dance squad in that it uses pom-poms in all its dance routines, whilst a regular dance squad may or may not do pom work in a dance routine. Dance teams are also popular in [[Concert dance|performance dance]], especially at sporting events, most commonly performing during the pre-game and halftime periods (and, in a number of cases, on the sidelines) of football and basketball games.
[[File:Spartan Gs Dance Team.JPG|thumb|The [[UNC Greensboro Spartans|Spartan Gs]], a collegiate dance team]]
Dance is a highly competitive activity. Youth/association, middle school, high school, collegiate, all-star, and professional teams, compete on local, regional, state, national, and international levels. Teams are judged on a number of criteria including form, team unison, showmanship, precision of motions, jumps, leaps, turns, choreography, enthusiasm, and, in the case of pom squads, visual use of poms-poms. Pom squads are like cheerleading or dance, but they use poms (pom-poms). Pom squads also use kicklines in their routines, after they set down their poms, or choose to hold them during the kickline. A kickline routine is a routine of kicks, which cheerleaders also use:  high kicks, fan kicks, low kicks, and kicks that go to their waist. Pom squads regularly compete in competitions and perform at sporting events.

==Overview==
Dance squads emphasize precise, synchronized motions along with technical dance skills (such as jumps, turns, and leaps). Their routines encompass various styles of dance including the more usually incorporated [[hip hop]], [[jazz]], [[lyrical dance|lyrical]], and [[kickline]] styles, to the more unusually used styles like [[disco]], [[rock and roll]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. A key feature of the dance is the ability to change formations very smoothly.

==Types of dance squads==

===High school and collegiate pom===

Traditional high school dance/pom squads include competition, performance dance, and promoting school spirit with dance. Dance/pom is usually a year-round sport, performing in competitions and at sporting events, most commonly football and basketball games. Some schools also have their dance team perform short sideline dances, and some dance teams also perform at school [[pep rally|pep rallies]].

College dance squads are like traditional high school squads in that both include competition and performance dance, but there are many differences between the two. For example, a college squad will most likely dance on the sidelines at games or have a specific spot in the stands, whereas high schools usually reserve this activity for [[cheerleading|cheerleaders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsity.com/event/1164/college_dance.aspx |title=Dance Team - College Dance Team |publisher=Varsity.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===All-star===

The [[U.S. All Star Federation]] governs all-star dance-pom squads.

Tryouts for all-star dance squads may be conducted in different ways. Some teams have only one tryout in the spring, whereas others may have a tryout in the spring and another in the fall. Some squads have year-round open tryouts where anyone can try out at any time during the season. The opportunity to compete in many large competitions attracts dancers to all-star programs. All-star dance teams can compete regionally, nationally, and even internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varsity.com/event/1163/allstar_dance.aspx |title=Dance Team - All Star Dance Team |publisher=Varsity.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas dance/drill teams===

Most high schools in Texas have a precision dance/drill team, usually with 25-75 members. The traditional uniform for teams typically includes a white hat and white boots, with team officers wearing a solid white uniform while the line members wear school colors. Teams perform visual routines at football games, both in the stands during the game, and on the field at halftime. During the spring, teams often perform at basketball game halftimes, and compete in many different dance styles at competitions sponsored by dance and drill team companies. They often conclude the year with a spring show in late April or early May.

Texas dance/drill teams are structured with a chain of command similar to the military including captains and lieutenants leading squads. Traditionally, Texas drill teams have been all female, but males have auditioned and been selected to teams in recent years.

Several colleges in Texas also have dance teams. Well-known teams include the [[Kilgore College Rangerettes]] and the [http://www.tjc.edu/belles/ Tyler Junior College Apache Belles]. A fierce but friendly rivalry between KC &amp; TJC has existed since the Apache Belles were formed in 1947. The Rangerettes were the first college drill team created in 1939 by Miss Gussie Nell Davis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danceadts.com/edsupport/history_drillteam.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Barbara Tidwell, a former Kilgore College Rangerette, created the [[Texas State University Strutters|Strutters]] at Southwest Texas State University (now [[Texas State University]]), the first precision dance team created at a four-year university.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danceadts.com/edsupport/history_drillteam.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===MSHSL dance team===

In Minnesota, competitive high school dance team is regulated under the [[Minnesota State High School League]]. The season begins after a two-week choreography period in October and ends after the state tournament in February each year. Team selection is led by the coaching staff in a tryout process individual to each participating school.

Teams within this league are able to compete in one of three class divisions: A, AA, or AAA and in one or both of two categories: high kick or jazz. The high kick division requires a routine that ranges from 2:30 to 3:00 in length, contains 45-60 kicks performed by all members, and consists of up to 34 competing members. The jazz division has a range between 2:30 and 3:00 in length and may have up to 26 competing members. Music selection is done by the coaching staff and/or members of the team. Throughout the state, a wide variety of costume styles are worn to enhance the theme or mood of each routine.

During the competition season, teams compete within their designated conference, at team invites, within designated sections, and may qualify to compete at the state tournament. Visit [[MSHSL dance team judging]] for more information on dance team scoring process. In addition to competitions, MSHSL dance teams also can perform at invitationals and school events including pep fests and basketball games.

===Professional===
Professional cheerleading incorporates a lot of pom dance styles, particularly in [[National Football League Cheerleading|NFL Cheerleading]] and [[National Basketball Association Cheerleading|NBA Cheerleading]].

==Tryouts==
Many dance squads both in high school and  college require everyone to attend a tryout. These are typically held in the spring or early summer, before most sports begin. There are many different aspects of a tryout. The first thing many tryouts do is go through basic dance techniques that will be used during the season. These include but are not limited to toe touches, fouetté turn combinations, kicks, and switch leaps. Other things that are many times included in a dance team tryout is the expectation that you can quickly master multiple short routines in different styles. Depending on what type of dance team the tryout is for will depend on what styles of dance you must know. NDA teams compete with routines that must incorporate jazz, hip hop, and pom styles, so many times you will learn a routine in each of these types of dance and then perform them shortly thereafter in front of a panel of judges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancespirit.com/articles/1344 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520161625/http://www.dancespirit.com/articles/1344 |date=May 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions==
In 1967, the legendary Dr. [[Kay Teer Crawford]] (1914-2001) founded [[Miss Dance Drill Team USA]], which is historically verified as the first [http://www.mddtusa.com national dance team competition] for precision dance teams, drill teams, and dance-sport teams in the United States. This event is recognized as the origin of the worldwide dance competition industry and hosts dance squads from elementary schools, secondary schools, and dance studios from across the United States. In 1981, Crawford started the world's first international dance/drill competition (Miss Dance Drill Team International World Championships) which has regularly hosted past international dance teams from the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Lithuania]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Poland]], [[Singapore]], and [[South Africa]]. In 1991, Crawford founded the world's first [http://www.mddtusa.com/street-dance-usa-national-hip-hop-dance-competition/ national hip hop dance competition]: National Street Dance USA. All events are held in the continental United States, with national events held in California each year. The international dance competition has been held in [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oliver|first1=Myrna|title=Kay Crawford: The Mother of Drill Team|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/sep/07/local/me-43200|agency=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Douglas|first1=Martin|title=Kay Teer Crawford, 88; Guided Drill Teams' Growth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/01/sports/kay-teer-crawford-88-guided-drill-teams-growth.html|agency=The New York Times|date=October 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Dance Drill Team USA|url=http://www.mddtusa.com|website=www.mddtusa.com|accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Champion Tours &amp; Events, Inc. conducts competitions for secondary school and all-star dance teams.

'''eMINTS''' is an [[education]]al program designed to train educators of children in the [[United States]].  The program's goals focus on technology in the classroom as well as social interaction and student research.  The program began in the US state of [[Missouri]].  It was originally an [[acronym]] for "enhancing Missouri's Instructional Networked Teaching Strategies", but is now used in [[Utah]], [[Illinois]], [[Maine]], [[Minnesota]], [[Nevada]], and [[Ohio]] as well.

The program is now being used with over 20,000 students in third to twelfth grade.

== Instructional Model ==
eMINTS professional development uses interactive group sessions and in-classroom coaching/mentoring to help teachers integrate technology into their teaching using an instructional model that supports high-quality lesson design, promotes inquiry-based learning, creates technology-rich learning environments, and builds community among students and teachers. These components comprise eMINTS's instructional model.

eMINTS professional development is available from eMINTS staff instructional specialists and through a “train-the-trainer” program called the eMINTS Affiliate Trainer program (formerly Professional Development for Educational Technology Specialists (PD4ETS).&lt;ref name="Official Site"&gt;[http://www.emints.org/about/what-is-emints/ website].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6432">'''Einar Ingvald Haugen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aʊ|ɡ|ən}}; April 19, 1906 – June 20, 1994) was an American [[linguistics|linguist]], author and [[Professor]] at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and [[Harvard University]].

==Biography==
Haugen was born in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] to Norwegians from the town of [[Oppdal]] in Norway.  When he was a young child, the family moved back to Oppdal for a few years, but then returned to the United States.  He attended [[Morningside College]] in Sioux City but transferred to [[St. Olaf College]] to study with [[Ole Edvart Rølvaag]]. He earned his B.A. in 1928 and immediately went on to graduate studies in linguistics at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], where he was awarded his [[Ph.D.]] in 1931.

In 1931 Haugen joined the faculty of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], where he stayed until 1962.  He was made Victor S. Thomas Professor of Scandinavian and Linguistics at [[Harvard University]] in 1964, and stayed here until his retirement in 1975.  Haugen served as president of the [[Linguistic Society of America]], the [[American Dialect Society]], and the [[Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study]]. Haugen was also a member of the Board of Editors of the [[Norwegian-American Historical Association]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.carli.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/npu_sahq&amp;CISOPTR=580&amp;filename=581.pdf ''Einar Haugen (1906-1994)'' ([[Lloyd Hustvedt]].  Swedish-American Historical Society.  April 1995, v.46, no.2, pages 141-142)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 he was awarded an [[honorary degree]], doctor philos. honoris causa, at the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]], later part of [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntnu.edu/phd/honorary-doctors|title=Honorary doctors at NTNU|publisher=Norwegian University of Science and Technology|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haugen is credited for having pioneered{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} the field of [[sociolinguistics]] and being a leading scholar within the field of Norwegian-American studies, including [[Old Norse]] studies.  Perhaps his most important work was ''The Norwegian language in America; A study in bilingual behavior'' ({{ISBN|0-253-34115-9}}).  In addition to several important works within these fields, he wrote the authoritative work on the dialect of his ancestral home of Oppdal and a book entitled ''The Ecology of Language'', with which he pioneered a new field of linguistics later called [[Ecolinguistics]].
Einar Haugen also wrote ''Norwegian English Dictionary/Norsk engelsk ordbok'' ({{ISBN|0-299-03874-2}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Einar Haugen, leading authority on Norwegian culture in US'' (The Boston Globe. Boston, MA.   June 25, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/05.24/16-haugen.html ''Memorial minute from Harvard University'']&lt;/ref&gt;

His last book was a biography of Norwegian virtuoso violinist [[Ole Bull]] co-written with his daughter, Camilla Cai.&lt;ref name="memorial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Memorials==
The ''Einar and Eva Lund Haugen Memorial Scholarship'' has been established by the Norwegian-American Historical Association to honor Einar Haugen and his wife [[Eva Lund Haugen]]. Additionally, the Boston Chapter of the American-Scandinavian Foundation voted to establish the ''Einar and Eva Haugen Prize''. The prize is awarded annually to an undergraduate or graduate student for excellence in the field of Scandinavian languages and literature at Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710080610/http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k4326&amp;pageid=icb.page50285 ''Einar and Eva Haugen Prize'' (The President and Fellows of Harvard College)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "English Plus" originated in a 1985 letter to then-[[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]] [[William Bennett]] from the [[Spanish American League Against Discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crawford|1992|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We fear that Secretary Bennett has lost sight of the fact that English is a key to equal educational opportunity, necessary but not sufficient. English by itself is not enough. Not English Only, English Plus! ...

Bennett is wrong. We won't accept English Only for our children. We want English plus. English plus math. Plus science. Plus social studies. Plus equal educational opportunities. English plus competence in the home language. Tell Bennett to enforce bilingual education and civil rights laws you enacted, or tell the President he cannot do his job. English Plus for everyone!}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5710">'''Environmental archaeology''' is a sub-field of [[archaeology]] and is the science of reconstructing the relationships between past societies and the environments they lived in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/envarch/what/|title=What is Environmental Archaeology?|last=|first=|date=|website=Florida Museum of Natural History|publisher=University of Florida|access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Archaeology: Approaches, Techniques &amp; Applications|last=Wilkinson|first=Keith|publisher=Tempus|year=2003|isbn=0752419315|location=Stroud|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field represents an archaeological-palaeoecological approach to studying the palaeoenvironment through the methods of human palaeoecology. Reconstructing past environments and past peoples' relationships and interactions with the landscapes they inhabited provides archaeologists with insights into the origin and evolution of anthropogenic environments, and prehistoric adaptations and economic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Archaeology: Theoretical and Practical Approaches|last=Branch|first=Nick|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=0340808713|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental archaeology is commonly divided into three sub-fields: 
* [[archaeobotany]] (the study of plant remains)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archaeobotany.dept.shef.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page|title = Online Archaeobotany Tutorial|last =|first =|date =|website = Integrated Archaeobotanical Research Project|publisher = University of Sheffield|access-date = 6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[zooarchaeology]] (the study of faunal remains)
* [[geoarchaeology]] (the study of geological processes and their relationship to the archaeological record)

Other related fields include:
*[[landscape archaeology]]
*[[bioarchaeology]] and [[human ecology]]
*[[climatology]]
*[[palaeoecology]]
*[[archival research]]

Environmental archaeology often involves studying plant and animal remains in order to investigate which plant and animal species were present at the time of prehistoric habitations, and how past societies managed them. It may also involve studying the physical environment and how similar or different it was in the past compared to the present day. An important component of such analyses represents the study of site formation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/sterms/g/siteformation.htm|title=Site Formation Processes|last=Kris|first=Hirst|date=|website=about education|publisher=|access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field is particularly useful when [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s may be absent from an excavated or surveyed site, or in cases of earth movement, such as [[erosion]], which may have buried artifacts and archaeological features. While specialist sub-fields, for example [[bioarchaeology]] or [[geomorphology]], are defined by the materials they study, the term "environmental" is used as a general template in order to denote a general field of scientific inquiry that is applicable across time periods and geographical regions studied by archaeology as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butzer|first=Karl W.|date=2012|title=Collapse, environment, and society|url=|journal=PNAS |volume=109 |pages=3632–3639|doi=10.1073/pnas.1114845109|pmid=|access-date=|pmc=3309741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental archaeology has emerged as a distinct discipline in the course of the last 50 years. In recent years it has grown rapidly in significance and is now an established component of most excavation projects. The field is multidisciplinary, and environmental archaeologists as well as palaeoecologists work side by side with archaeologists and anthropologists specialising in material culture studies in order to achieve a more holistic understanding of past human lifeways and people-environment interactions.

A notable pioneer of environmental archaeology has been [[Karl Butzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk9Q0XUHdLU|title=An interview with Professor Karl W. Butzer|last=|first=|date=1987|website=YouTube|publisher=Anne Buttimer|access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Each focus within environmental archaeology collects information about a different aspect of human relation with their surrounding environment. Together these components (along with methods from other fields) are combined to fully understand a past society’s lifestyle and interactions with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;
Environmental archaeology: theoretical and practical approaches. Place of publication not identified: Routledge, 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; Past aspects of land use, food production, tool use, and occupation patterns can all be established and the knowledge applied to current and future human-environment interactions.

{{global|date=April 2012}}
'''Excusable negligence''' is a [[paradox]]ical phrase, since if the failure to exercise [[Duty of care|reasonable care]] under the circumstances is excusable, there is no [[negligence]]. 38 Am J1st Negl § 12.  As used in statutes authorizing the opening of a default and allowing a party to defend [[on the merits]], the standard set by courts is slippery to define, but cases seem to agree that a reasonable excuse is sufficient, where it appears that the defense is meritorious and no substantial prejudice will result from setting aside the default.

'''Finnur Jónsson''' (May 29, 1858 – March 30, 1934) was an Icelandic [[philologist]] and Professor of Nordic Philology at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He made extensive contributions to the study of [[Old Norse literature]].

Finnur Jónsson was born at [[Akureyri]] in northern [[Iceland]]. He graduated from [[Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík]] in 1878 and went to Denmark for further studies at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He received a doctorate in philology in 1884 with a dissertation on [[skaldic poetry]]. He became a [[docent]] at the University in 1887 and a professor in 1898, serving until 1928. After retiring he continued work on his subject with new publications until the year he died.

|date=

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected member of the [[Royal Society of Arts and Sciences in Gothenburg]] in 1905 and corresponding member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://runeberg.org/nfbm/0067.html|title=Nordisk familjebok|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1910|isbn=|editor-last=Westrin|editor-first=Theodor|volume=13|location=|pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finnur's principal area of study was [[Old Norse poetry]]. His three most important works are ''Den norsk-islandske skjaldedigtning'', an edition of the entire corpus of skaldic poetry in two parts - one which gives the text of the manuscripts with variants and one which gives a normalized text and a Danish translation. Another of Finnur's major works is ''Lexicon Poeticum'', a dictionary of Old Norse poetry, ostensibly an update of a work with the same name by [[Sveinbjörn Egilsson]] but in effect an original work. The third principal work is ''Den oldnorske og oldislandske litteraturs historie'', a detailed history of Old Norse literature.

Finnur was an unusually prolific scholar, preparing editions of, among other works, numerous [[Icelanders' sagas]], [[Kings' sagas]], ''[[Rímur]]'' (along with a dictionary of ''rímur'') and the [[Edda]]s. A skilled [[polemic]]ist, he defended his belief in the historical accuracy of the sagas and the antiquity of the Eddic poems in debates with other scholars.

The '''Georgian calendar''' ({{lang-ka|ქართული კალენდარი}}) is the ancient or modern calendar of '''[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'''.

Though Georgia now uses the modern [[Gregorian calendar]], the old names for the months are still used.

[[File:IPA chart 2018.pdf|thumb|upright=1.5|The latest chart of the International Phonetic Alphabet, revised to 2018.]]

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] was created soon after the [[International Phonetic Association]] was established in the late 19th century. It was intended as an international system of phonetic transcription for [[oral language]]s, originally for pedagogical purposes. The Association was established in [[Paris]] in 1886 by French and British language teachers led by [[Paul Passy]]. The prototype of the alphabet appeared in {{harvp|Phonetic Teachers' Association|1888b}}. The Association based their alphabet upon the [[Romic alphabet]] of [[Henry Sweet]], which in turn was based on the [[English Phonotypic Alphabet|Phonotypic Alphabet]] of [[Isaac Pitman]] and the [[Palaeotype alphabet|Palæotype]] of [[Alexander John Ellis]].{{sfnp|Kelly|1981}}

The alphabet has undergone a number of revisions during its history, the most significant being the one put forth at the Kiel Convention in 1989. Changes to the alphabet are proposed and discussed in the Association's organ, ''[[Journal of the International Phonetic Association]]'', previously known as ''Le Maître Phonétique'' and before that as ''The Phonetic Teacher'', and then put to a vote by the Association's Council.

The [[extensions to the IPA]] for disordered speech were created in 1990, with its first major revision approved in 2016.{{sfnp|Ball|Howard|Miller|2018}}

==Early alphabets==
The International Phonetic Association was founded in Paris in 1886 under the name ''Dhi Fonètik Tîtcerz' Asóciécon'' (The Phonetic Teachers' Association), a development of ''L'Association phonétique des professeurs d'Anglais'' ("The English Teachers' Phonetic Association"), to promote an international phonetic alphabet, designed primarily for English, French, and German, for use in schools to facilitate acquiring foreign pronunciation.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=194–7}}

Originally the symbols had different phonetic values from language to language. For example, English {{IPA|[ʃ]}} was transcribed with {{angbr|c}} and French {{IPA|[ʃ]}} with {{angbr|x}}.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=196}}

As of May and November of 1887, the alphabets were as follows:{{sfnp|Phonetic Teachers' Association|1887a}}{{sfnp|Phonetic Teachers' Association|1887b}}

==1888 alphabet==
In the August–September 1888 issue of its journal, the Phonetic Teachers' Association published a standardized alphabet intended for transcription of multiple languages, reflecting its members' consensus that only one set of alphabet ought to be used for all languages,{{sfnp|Phonetic Teachers' Association|1888a}} along with a set of six principles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# There should be a separate sign for each distinctive sound; that is, for each sound which, being used instead of another, in the same language, can change the meaning of a word.
# When any sound is found in several languages, the same sign should be used in all. This applies also to very similar shades of sound.
# The alphabet should consist as much as possible of the ordinary letters of the roman alphabet; as few new letters as possible being used.
# In assigning values to the roman letters, international usage should decide.
# The new letters should be suggestive of the sounds they represent, by their resemblance to the old ones.
# Diacritic marks should be avoided, being trying for the eyes and troublesome to write.{{sfnp|Phonetic Teachers' Association|1888b}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The principles would govern all future development of the alphabet, with the exception of #5 and in some cases #2,{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1949|loc=back endpaper}} until they were revised drastically in 1989.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1989a}} #6 has also been loosened, as diacritics have been admitted for limited purposes.{{sfnp|Kemp|2006|p=407}}

The devised alphabet was as follows. The letters marked with an asterisk were "provisional shapes", which were meant to be replaced "when circumstances will allow".{{sfnp|Phonetic Teachers' Association|1888b}}

==1900 chart==
During the 1890s, the alphabet was expanded to cover sounds of Arabic and other non-European languages which did not easily fit the Latin alphabet.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=196}}

Throughout the first half of the 1900s, the Association published a series of booklets outlining the specifications of the alphabet in several languages, the first being a French edition published in 1900.{{sfnp|MacMahon|1986|pp=35, 38 n.&amp;nbsp;20}} In the book, the chart appeared as follows:{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1900b|p=7}}

Initially, the charts were arranged with laryngeal sounds on the left and labial ones on the right, following the convention of [[Alexander Melville Bell]]'s [[Visible Speech]].{{sfnp|Esling|2010|p=681}} Vowels and consonants were placed in a single chart, reflecting how sounds ranged in openness from stops (top) to open vowels (bottom). The [[voiced velar fricative]] was represented by {{angbr|[[File:Looptail g.svg|8px]]}} (distinct from {{angbr|{{IPA|ɡ}}}}, which represents a plosive) since 1895 until it was replaced by {{angbr|{{IPA|ǥ}}}} in 1900.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1895}}{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1900a}} {{angbr|{{IPA|ǥ}}}} too would be replaced by {{angbr|{{IPA|ɣ}}}} in 1931.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1931}}

Not all symbols, especially those in the fricatives row which included both [[fricative]]s in modern terms and [[approximant]]s, were self-explanatory and could only be discerned in the notes following the chart, which re-defined symbols using the orthographies of languages wherein the sounds they represent occur. For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(θ) is the English hard ''th'', Spanish ''z'', Romaic θ, Icelandic þ; (ð) the English soft ''th'', Icelandic ð, Romaic δ. (ɹ) is the non-rolled ''r'' of Southern British, and can also be used for the simple ''r'' of Spanish and Portuguese&amp;nbsp;... (x) is found in German in ''ach''; (ǥ), in ''wagen'', as often pronounced in the north of Germany. (ᴚ) is the Arabic ''kh'' as in ''khalifa''; (ʁ) the Danish ''r''; the Parisian ''r'' is intermediate between (ʀ) and (ʁ). (ʜ) and (ɦ) are the ''ha'' and ''he'' in Arabic.—(ᵷ) and (&lt;span style="display: inline-block; {{transform|rotate(180deg) translateY(-0.3em)}}"&gt;ʒ&lt;/span&gt;) are sounds in [[Adyghe language|Circassian]].{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1900b|p=8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Nasalized vowel]]s were marked with a [[tilde]]: {{angbr|{{IPA|ã}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ẽ}}}}, etc. It was noted that {{angbr|{{IPA|ə}}}} may be used for "any vowel of obscure and intermediate quality found in weak syllables".{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1900b|p=8}} A long sound was distinguished by trailing {{angbr|{{IPA|ː}}}}. Stress may be marked by {{angbr|{{IPA|´}}}} before the stressed syllable as necessary. It was noted that in Swedish and Norwegian texts the sign {{angbr|{{IPA|ˇ}}}} was placed before the stressed syllable of words with "the so-called compound tone".{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1900b|p=8}}

A voiced sound was marked by {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̬}}}} and a voiceless one by {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̥}}}}. [[Retroflex consonant]]s were marked by {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̣}}}}, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|ṣ, ṭ, ṇ}}}}. Arabic [[emphatic consonant]]s were marked by {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̤}}}}: {{angbr|{{IPA|s̤, t̤, d̤}}}}. Consonants accompanied by a glottal stop ([[ejective]]s) were marked by {{angbr|{{IPA|ʼ}}}}: {{angbr|{{IPA|kʼ, pʼ}}}}. [[Tense and lax vowels]] were distinguished by acute and grave accents: ''naught'' {{IPA|[nɔ́ːt]}}, ''not'' {{IPA|[nɔ̀t]}}. Non-syllabic vowels were marked by a [[breve]], as in {{angbr|{{IPA|ŭ}}}}, and syllabic consonants by an acute below, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|n̗}}}}. Following letters, {{angbr|{{IPA|{{resize|50%|⊢}}}}}} stood for advanced tongue, {{angbr|{{IPA|{{resize|50%|⊣}}}}}} for retracted tongue, {{angbr|{{IPA|˕}}}} for more open, {{angbr|{{IPA|˔}}}} for more close, {{angbr|{{IPA|˒}}}} for more rounded, and {{angbr|{{IPA|˓}}}} for more spread. It was also noted that a superscript letter may be used to indicate a tinge of that sound in the sound represented by the preceding letter, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|ʃ&lt;sup&gt;ç&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1900b|p=9}}

It was emphasized, however, that such details need not usually be repeated in transcription.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1900b|p=9}} The equivalent part of the 1904 English version said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t must remain a general principle to ''leave out everything self-evident, and everything that can be explained once for all''. This allows us to dispense almost completely with the modifiers, and with a good many other signs, except in scientific works and in introductory explanations. We write English ''fill'' and French ''fil'' the same way {{IPA|'''fil'''}}; yet the English vowel is 'wide' and the French 'narrow', and the English {{IPA|'''l'''}} is formed much further back than the French. If we wanted to mark these differences&lt;!-- corrected from 'difference' per [[MOS:SIC]] --&gt;, we should write English {{IPA|'''fìl'''{{resize|50%|⊣}}}}, French {{IPA|'''fíl'''{{resize|50%|⊢}}}}. But we need not do so: we know, once for all, that English short {{IPA|'''i'''}} is always {{IPA|ì}}, and French {{IPA|'''i'''}} always {{IPA|í}}; that English {{IPA|'''l'''}} is always {{IPA|'''l'''{{resize|50%|⊣}}}} and French {{IPA|'''l'''}} always {{IPA|'''l'''{{resize|50%|⊢}}}}.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1904|p=10}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In comparison to the 1900 chart, the [[glottal stop]] appeared as a modifier letter {{angbr|{{IPA|ˀ}}}} rather than a full letter {{angbr|{{IPA|ʔ}}}}, and {{angbr|{{IPA|ʊ}}}} replaced {{angbr|{{IPA|ᴜ}}}}. {{angbr|{{IPA|1=ᵷ, &lt;span style="display: inline-block; {{transform|rotate(180deg) translateY(-0.3em)}}"&gt;ʒ&lt;/span&gt;}}}} were removed from the chart and instead only mentioned as having "been suggested for a Circassian dental hiss and its voiced correspondent".{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1904|p=10}} Laryngeal consonants had also been moved around, reflecting little understanding about the mechanisms of laryngeal articulations at the time.{{sfnp|Heselwood|2013|pp=112–3}} {{angbr|{{IPA|ʜ}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|{{sc2|Q}}}}}} were defined as the Arabic {{lang|ar|ح}} and {{lang|ar|ع}}.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1904|p=8}}{{efn|name=q|The small capital Q {{angbr|{{IPA|ꞯ}}}} was adopted for a voiceless upper pharyngeal stop by the [[extensions to the IPA]] in 2016.{{sfnp|Ball|Howard|Miller|2018|pp=160–1}}}}

In the notes, the half-length symbol {{angbr|{{IPA|ˑ}}}} was now mentioned. It was noted that whispered sounds may be marked with a diacritical comma, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|u̦, i̦}}}}. A syllabic consonant was now marked by a vertical bar, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|n̩}}}}, rather than {{angbr|{{IPA|n̗}}}}.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1904|p=9}} It was noted, only in this edition, that "shifted vowels" may be indicated: {{angbr|{{IPA|{{resize|50%|⊣⊣}}}}}} for in-mixed or in-front, and {{angbr|{{IPA|{{resize|50%|⊢⊢}}}}}} for out-back.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Association phonétique internationale|1904|p=9}}, citing {{harvp|Sweet|1902|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1912 chart==
Following 1904, sets of specifications in French appeared in 1905 and 1908, with little to no changes.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1905}}{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1908}} In 1912, the second English booklet appeared. For the first time, labial sounds were shown on the left and laryngeal ones on the right:{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1912|p=10}}

{{angbr|{{IPA|ř}}}}, for the [[Voiced alveolar fricative trill|Czech fricative trill]], and {{angbr|{{IPA|ɛ̈}}}}, replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|ä}}}}, were added, following their approval in 1909.{{sfnp|Passy|1909}} Though not included in the chart, {{angbr|{{IPA|ɱ}}}} was mentioned as an optional symbol for the [[labiodental nasal]]. {{angbr|{{IPA|ɹ}}}} was still designated as the "provisional" symbol for the alveolar tap/flap. {{angbr|{{IPA|σ, ƍ}}}} were defined as the Bantu sounds with "tongue position of '''θ, ð''', combined with strong lip-rounding". {{angbr|{{IPA|ʜ, {{sc2|Q}}}}}} were still included though not in the chart.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1912|p=12}} {{angbr|{{IPA|ᴙ}}}} was removed entirely.

For the first time, affricates, or {{"'}}[a]ssibilated' consonant groups, i.&amp;nbsp;e. groups in which the two elements are so closely connected that the whole might be treated as a single sound", were noted as able to be represented with a [[tie (typography)|tie bar]], as in {{angbr|{{IPA|t͡ʃ, d͜z}}}}. [[Palatalization (phonetics)|Palatalized]] consonants could be marked by a [[dot (diacritic)|dot]] above the letter, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|ṡ, ṅ, ṙ}}}}, "suggesting the connexion with the sounds '''i''' and '''j'''".{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1912|p=13}}

{{angbr|{{IPA|{{resize|50%|⊢}}, {{resize|50%|⊣}}}}}} were no longer mentioned.

{{angbr|{{IPA|χ}}}} replaced {{angbr|{{IPA|ᴚ}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|ɤ}}}} replaced {{angbr|{{IPA|{{sc2|Ɐ}}}}}}, both of which would not officially be approved until 1928.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1928}} {{angbr|{{IPA|ƕ}}}} replaced {{angbr|{{IPA|ʍ}}}} and {{angbr|[[File:H turned H ligature.svg|12px]]}} was added for a devoiced {{IPAblink|ɥ}}, but neither has appeared in any other IPA chart. Also added were central vowels {{angbr|{{IPA|ɨ, ʉ, ɘ, ɵ, ɜ, ʚ}}}}, which also appeared in {{harvp|Trofimov|Jones|1923|p=40}}, and in the chart in ''Le Maître Phonétique'' from 1926 to 1927, though without the Council's approval.{{sfnp|Esling|2010|pp=681–2}}{{sfnp|Wells|1975}} Of these, only {{angbr|{{IPA|ɨ, ʉ, ɜ, ɵ}}}} were approved in the 1928 revision, with a different value for {{angbr|{{IPA|ɜ}}}}, until {{angbr|{{IPA|ɘ, ʚ}}}} were revived and {{angbr|{{IPA|ɜ}}}} regained the 1921 value in 1993.

The book also mentioned symbols "already commonly used in special works", some of which "have not yet been definitively adopted":{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1921|pp=8–9}}

*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɾ}}}} for a single-tap ''r''
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ř}}}} for the Czech fricative trill
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɦ}}}} for a voiced {{IPAblink|h}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ħ, ʕ}}}} for the Arabic {{lang|ar|ح}} and {{lang|ar|ع}}, "whose formation we do not yet agree on"
*{{angbr|{{IPA|σ, ƍ}}}} (dental) and {{angbr|{{IPA|ƪ, ƺ}}}} (alveolar or palatal) for labiolized sibilants found in South African languages
*As merely "suggested":
**{{angbr|{{IPA|1=ᵷ, &lt;span style="display: inline-block; {{transform|rotate(180deg) translateY(-0.3em)}}"&gt;ʒ&lt;/span&gt;}}}} for Circassian dental fricatives
**{{angbr|{{IPA|ɮ}}}} for fricative {{IPA|[l]}} of Bantu languages
**{{angbr|{{IPA|ɺ}}}} for a sound between {{IPA|[r]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} found in African languages and in Japanese
*Small ''j'' for palatalized consonants: {{angbr|{{IPA|ƫ, ᶎ}}}}
*Overlaying tilde for velarized and Arabic emphatic consonants: {{angbr|{{IPA|ᵵ, ᵭ}}}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɕ, ʑ}}}} for "dentalized palatals"
*{{angbr|[[File:T with left hook.svg|7px]]}}, {{angbr|[[File:D with left hook.svg|11px]]}}, etc. for retroflex
*{{angbr|{{IPA|1=&lt;span style="{{mirrorH}}"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;}}}} for the Hindustani retroflex ''r''
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ʧ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ʤ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ʦ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ʣ}}}}, etc. for affricates
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ᴜ, ɪ, ʏ}}}} for closer varieties of {{IPA|[o, e, ø]}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɒ, æ}}}} for the vowels in English ''not, man'' between open and half-open
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ʇ, ʖ, ʞ, ʗ}}}} for clicks

It also introduced several new suprasegmental specifications:{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1921|p=9}}

*{{angbr|{{IPA|ˎ}}}} for "half-accent"
*{{angbr|{{IPA|˝}}}} for "reinforced accent"
*Tones could be indicated either before the syllable or on the nuclear vowel: {{angbr|{{IPA|´◌, ◌́}}}} high rising, {{angbr|{{IPA|ˉ◌, ◌̄}}}} high level, {{angbr|{{IPA|ˋ◌, ◌̀}}}} high falling, {{angbr|{{IPA|ˏ◌, ◌̗}}}} low rising, {{angbr|{{IPA|ˍ◌, ◌̱}}}} low level, {{angbr|{{IPA|ˎ◌, ◌̖}}}} low falling, {{angbr|{{IPA|ˆ◌, ◌̂}}}} rise-fall, {{angbr|{{IPA|ˇ◌, ◌̌}}}} fall-rise
*Medium tones, as necessary: {{angbr|{{IPA|1=&lt;span style="display: inline-block; {{transform|translateY(0.5em)}}"&gt;´&lt;/span&gt;◌}}}} mid rising, {{angbr|{{IPA|1=&lt;span style="display: inline-block; {{transform|translateY(0.5em)}}"&gt;ˉ&lt;/span&gt;◌}}}} mid level, {{angbr|{{IPA|˴◌}}}} mid falling

It recommended the use of a circumflex for the Swedish grave accent, as in {{IPA|[ˆandən]}} ("the spirit").{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1921|p=9}} It was mentioned that some authors prefer {{angbr|{{IPA|˖, ˗}}}} in place of {{angbr|{{IPA|{{resize|50%|⊢}}, {{resize|50%|⊣}}}}}}. Aspiration was marked as {{angbr|{{IPA|pʻ, tʻ, kʻ}}}} and stronger aspiration as {{angbr|{{IPA|ph, th, kh}}}}.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1921|p=10}}

The click symbols {{angbr|{{IPA|ʇ, ʖ, ʞ, ʗ}}}} were conceived by [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Daniel Jones]]. In 1960, [[A.&amp;nbsp;C. Gimson]] wrote to a colleague:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Paul Passy recognized the need for symbols for the various clicks in the July–August 1914 number of ''Le Maître Phonétique'' and asked for suggestions. This number, however, was the last for some years because of the war. During this interval, Professor Daniel Jones himself invented the four symbols, in consultation with Paul Passy and they were all four printed in the pamphlet ''L'Écriture Phonétique Internationale'' published in 1921. The symbols were thus introduced in a somewhat unusual way, without the explicit consent of the whole Council of the Association. They were, however, generally accepted from then on, and, as you say, were used by Professor Doke in 1923. I have consulted Professor Jones in this matter, and he accepts responsibility for their invention, during the period of the First World War.{{sfnp|Breckwoldt|1972|p=285}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{angbr|{{IPA|ʇ, ʖ, ʗ}}}} were later approved by the Council in 1928.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1928}} {{angbr|{{IPA|ʞ}}}} would be included in all subsequent booklets,{{sfnp|Jones|1928|p=26}}{{sfnp|Jones|Camilli|1933|p=11}}{{sfnp|Jones|Dahl|1944|p=12}}{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1949|p=14}} but not in the single-page charts. It is considered to have been withdrawn by 1979 because the production of a velar click was deemed impossible. The symbol was repurposed by the [[extensions to the IPA]] to denote a velodorsal stop in 2004, but this usage was withdrawn in 2016 because [[back-released velar click]]s were reported to occur in some languages.{{sfnp|Ball|Howard|Miller|2018|pp=159, 161}}

The 1921 book was the first in the series to mention the word ''phoneme'' (''phonème'').{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1921|p=10}}

==1925 Copenhagen Conference and 1927 revision==
In April 1925, 12 linguists led by [[Otto Jespersen]], including IPA Secretary [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Daniel Jones]], attended a conference in Copenhagen and proposed specifications for a standardized system of phonetic notation.{{sfnp|Jespersen|Pedersen|1926}} The proposals were largely dismissed by the members of the IPA Council.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|1998|p=315}} Nonetheless, the following additions recommended by the Conference were approved in 1927:{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1927}}

*{{angbr|{{IPA|ˑ}}}} could now indicate full length when there is no need to distinguish half and full length
*Straight {{angbr|{{IPA|ˈ}}}} for stress instead of the previous slanted {{angbr|{{IPA|´}}}}, and {{angbr|{{IPA|ˌ}}}} for secondary stress
*{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̫}}}} for labialized and {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̪}}}} for dental
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ʈ, ɖ, ɳ, ɭ, ɽ, ʂ, ʐ}}}} for retroflex consonants, previously represented by {{angbr|{{IPA|ṭ, ḍ, ṇ, ḷ, ṛ, ṣ, ẓ}}}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɸ, β}}}} for bilabial fricatives, replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|ꜰ, ʋ}}}} ({{angbr|{{IPA|ʋ}}}} was repurposed for the [[labiodental approximant]])
*{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̣}}}} for more close and {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̨}}}} for more open

==1928 revisions==
In 1928, the following symbols were adopted:{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1928}}

*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɬ, ɮ}}}} for lateral fricatives
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɕ}}}} for Polish ''ś'' or Pekingese ''hs'', and {{angbr|{{IPA|ʑ}}}} for Polish ''ź''
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ᵭ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ᵶ}}}}, etc. for [[velarization]] or [[pharyngealization]] (by extension from {{angbr|{{IPA|ɫ}}}})
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ħ, ʕ}}}} for the Arabic {{lang|ar|ح}} and {{lang|ar|ع}}, replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|ʜ, {{sc2|Q}}}}}}{{efn|name=q}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|χ}}}} for a voiceless uvular fricative, replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|ᴚ}}}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ƫ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ᶁ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ᶇ}}}}, etc. for [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] consonants
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɨ, ʉ, ɵ}}}} for {{IPA|[ï, ü, ö]}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɜ}}}} for a central vowel closer than {{IPA|[ɐ]}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ʇ, ʖ, ʗ}}}} for clicks (Zulu ''c, q, x'')
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɓ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ɗ}}}}, etc. for [[implosive]]s
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ƪ, ƺ}}}} for labialized {{IPA|[ʃ, ʒ]}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɺ}}}} for a sound "intermediate between {{IPA|'''l'''}} and {{IPA|'''d'''}} in African languages"

In the same year, {{angbr|{{IPA|ɒ}}}} for the rounded variety of {{IPA|[ɑ]}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|ɤ}}}}, replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|{{sc2|Ɐ}}}}}}, were also approved.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|1998|p=315}}

{{harvp|Jones|1928}} also included {{angbr|{{IPA|ɱ}}}} for a [[labiodental nasal]], {{angbr|{{IPA|ɾ}}}} for a dental or alveolar tap, {{angbr|{{IPA|ʞ}}}} for a [[velar click]], and the tonal notation system seen in {{harvp|Association phonétique internationale|1921|p=9}}. For the Swedish and Norwegian compound tones he recommended "any arbitrarily chosen mark", with the illustration {{IPA|[˟andən]}} ("the spirit"). He used {{angbr|{{IPA|ᴜ}}}} in place of {{angbr|{{IPA|ʊ}}}}.{{sfnp|Jones|1928|pp=23, 25–7}} Apart from {{angbr|{{IPA|ᴜ}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|ʞ}}}}, these new specifications would be inherited in the subsequent charts and booklets. The diacritic for whispered {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̦}}}} or those for tense and lax {{angbr|{{IPA|◌́, ◌̀}}}} were no longer mentioned.

==1932 chart==

The vowels were now arranged in a right-angled trapezium as opposed to an [[isosceles trapezium]], reflecting [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Daniel Jones]]' development of the [[Cardinal Vowel]] theory. A practically identical chart—with the exception of {{angbr|{{IPA|ɣ}}}}—in German had appeared in {{harvp|Jones|1928|p=23}}. The substitution of {{angbr|{{IPA|ɣ}}}} for {{angbr|{{IPA|ǥ}}}} was approved in 1931.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1931}}

The accompanying notes read:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1938 chart==
A new chart appeared in 1938, with a few modifications. {{angbr|{{IPA|ɮ}}}} was replaced by {{angbr|{{IPA|ꜧ}}}}, which was approved earlier in the year with the compromise {{angbr|[[File:Lezh old.svg|8px]]}} also acknowledged as an alternative.{{sfnp|Jones|1938}} The use of tie bars {{angbr|{{IPA|◌͡◌, ◌͜◌}}}} was allowed for [[Co-articulated consonant|synchronous articulation]] in addition to affricates, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|m͡ŋ}}}} for simultaneous {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[ŋ]}}, which was approved in 1937.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1937}} In the notes, the reference to {{harvp|Association phonétique internationale|1921|p=9}}, in regard to tonal notation was removed.{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1938}}

==1947 chart==
A new chart appeared in 1947, reflecting minor developments up to the point. They were:{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1947}}

*{{angbr|{{IPA|ʔ}}}} for the glottal stop, replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|ˀ}}}}
*{{angbr|[[File:Lezh old.svg|8px]]}}, the compromise form approved as an alternative in 1938,{{sfnp|Jones|1938}} replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|ꜧ}}}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ʆ, ʓ}}}} for palatalized {{IPA|[ʃ, ʒ]}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɼ}}}} replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|ř}}}}, approved in 1945{{sfnp|Jones|1945}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ƞ}}}} for the Japanese syllabic nasal
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɧ}}}} for a combination of {{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[ʃ]}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɩ, ɷ}}}} replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|ɪ, ʊ}}}}, approved in 1943 while condoning the use of the latter except in the Association's official publications{{sfnp|Jones|1943}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ƾ, ƻ}}}} as alternatives for {{IPA|[t͡s, d͡z]}}
*[[R-coloured vowel]]s: {{angbr|{{IPA|eɹ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|aɹ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ɔɹ}}}}, etc., {{angbr|{{IPA|eʴ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|aʴ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ɔʴ}}}}, etc., or {{angbr|{{IPA|ᶒ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ᶏ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ᶗ}}}}, etc.
*R-coloured {{IPA|[ə]}}: {{angbr|{{IPA|əɹ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|əʴ}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ɹ}}}}, or {{angbr|{{IPA|ᶕ}}}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̟, ◌˖}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̠, ◌˗}}}} (or with serifs, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|1=◌&lt;span style="font-family: serif; display: inline-block; {{transform|rotate(90deg) scaleY(0.5) translateX(0.2em)}}"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;}}}}) for advanced and retracted, respectively, officially replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|◌{{resize|50%|⊢}}, ◌{{resize|50%|⊣}}}}}}

The word "plosives" in the description of ejectives and the qualifier "slightly" in the definitions of {{angbr|{{IPA|˔, ˕}}}} were removed.

==1949 ''Principles''==
The 1949 ''Principles of the International Phonetic Association'' was the last installment in the series until it was superseded by the ''Handbook of the IPA'' in 1999.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=vii}} It introduced some new specifications:{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1949|pp=15–9}}

*Inserting a hyphen between a plosive and a homorganic fricative to denote they are separately pronounced, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|t-s}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|d-z}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|t-ʃ}}}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|eh}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ah}}}}, etc. or {{angbr|{{IPA|e̒}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|a̒}}}}, etc. for "vowels pronounced with 'breathy voice' (h-coloured vowels)"
*{{angbr|{{IPA|m̆b}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|n̆d}}}}, etc. "to show that a nasal consonant is very short and that the intimate combination with the following plosive counts as a single sound", in parallel to use for non-syllabic vowels
*An "arbitrarily chosen mark" such as {{angbr|{{IPA|˟}}}} or {{angbr|{{IPA|ˇ}}}} for a Swedish or Norwegian compound tone, as in {{IPA|[ˇandən]}} ("the spirit"), mentioning both symbols simultaneously for the first time

None of these specifications were inherited in the subsequent charts. {{angbr|{{IPA|ˌ}}}} was defined as an indicator of "medium stress".{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1949|p=18}}

In 1948, {{angbr|{{IPA|ɡ}}}} and {{angbr|[[File:Looptail g.svg|8px]]}} were approved as typographic alternatives, while it was also acknowledged that {{angbr|[[File:Looptail g.svg|8px]]}} may be used for a velar plosive and {{angbr|{{IPA|ɡ}}}} for an advanced one in narrow transcription of a language where it is preferable to distinguish the two, such as Russian.{{sfnp|Jones|1948}} The 1949 ''Principles'' recommended this alternation of the symbols but did not mention their typographic equivalency in other languages.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1949|p=14}} Nevertheless, the recommendation was hardly adopted,{{sfnp|Wells|2006}} not even by {{harvp|Jones|Ward|1969}}, who used {{angbr|{{IPA|ɡ}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|ᶃ}}}}.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=115}}

==1951 chart==
The 1951 chart added {{angbr|{{IPA|ɚ}}}} as yet another alternative to an r-coloured {{IPA|[ə]}},{{sfnp|Association phonétique internationale|1952}} following its approval in 1950.{{sfnp|Gimson|1950}} Conceived by [[John S. Kenyon]], the symbol was in itself a combination of {{angbr|{{IPA|ə}}}} and the hook for retroflex consonants approved by the IPA in 1927. Since its introduction in 1935, the symbol was widely adopted by American linguists and the IPA had been asked to recognize it as part of the alphabet.{{sfnp|Kenyon|1951|pp=315–7}}{{sfnp|Editors of ''American Speech''|1939}}

==1979 chart==
In 1979, a revised chart appeared, incorporating the developments in the alphabet which were made earlier in the decade:{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1978}}

{{angbr|{{IPA|ɻ}}}} for a [[retroflex approximant]] was approved in 1973. On the same occasion, {{angbr|{{IPA|š}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|ž}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|č}}}}, and {{angbr|{{IPA|ǰ}}}} or {{angbr|{{IPA|ǧ}}}} as alternatives for {{IPA|[ʃ, ʒ, tʃ, dʒ]}} were proposed but the votes were inconclusive. Diacritics {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̢}}}} (subscript, not attached) for retroflexion, {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̮}}}} for palatalization, and {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̯}}}} for indicating non-fricative continuant were proposed but rejected.{{sfnp|Gimson|1973}}

The following changes were approved in 1976:{{sfnp|Wells|1976}}

*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɶ}}}} for the rounded equivalent of {{IPA|[a]}} (taken from the accompanying text to [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Daniel Jones]]' 1956 recording of the Secondary [[Cardinal Vowels]]){{sfnp|Wells|1975}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̈}}}} representing "centralized" rather than "central"
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ʰ}}}} for [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] (though this was approved merely as an alternative to {{angbr|{{IPA|ʻ}}}}, neither the latter symbol nor {{angbr|{{IPA|h}}}} succeeding a plosive were mentioned in the 1979 chart)
*{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̚}}}} for [[Unreleased stop|absence of audible release]] (omitted in the chart)
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ʘ}}}} for a [[bilabial click]]
*{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̤}}}} for [[breathy voice]]
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ɰ}}}} for a [[velar approximant]]
*Application of {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̣, ◌̨}}}} (but not {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̝ ◌˔, ◌̞ ◌˕}}}}) to consonant symbols to denote fricative and approximant, respectively, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|ɹ̣, ɹ̨}}}}

On the same occasion, the following symbols were removed because they had "fallen into disuse":{{sfnp|Wells|1976}}

*{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̇}}}} for palatalization
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ƾ, ƻ}}}} for {{IPA|[t͡s, d͡z]}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|ƞ}}}} for Japanese moraic nasal
*{{angbr|{{IPA|σ, ƍ, ƪ, ƺ}}}} for labialized {{IPA|[θ, ð, ʃ, ʒ]}}
*{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̢}}}} for r-colouring, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|ᶒ, ᶏ, ᶗ, ᶕ}}}}

On the other hand, {{angbr|{{IPA|ɘ}}}} for the [[close-mid central unrounded vowel]], {{angbr|{{IPA|ɞ}}}} for the [[open-mid central rounded vowel]], and {{angbr|{{IPA|ᴀ}}}} for the [[open central unrounded vowel]] were proposed but rejected.{{sfnp|Wells|1975}}{{sfnp|Wells|1976}} The proposal of {{angbr|{{IPA|ɘ, ɞ}}}} was based on {{harvp|Abercrombie|1967|p=161}}.{{sfnp|McClure|1972|p=20}} {{angbr|{{IPA|ʝ}}}} for the [[voiced palatal fricative]] and {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̰}}}} for [[creaky voice]] were proposed but the votes were inconclusive.{{sfnp|Wells|1976}}

In the 1979 chart, {{angbr|{{IPA|ɩ, ʏ, ɷ}}}}, previously defined as "lowered varieties of {{IPA|'''i''', '''y''', '''u'''}}", appeared slightly centered rather than simply midway between {{IPA|[i, y, u]}} and {{IPA|[e, ø, o]}} as they did in the 1912 chart. {{angbr|{{IPA|ɪ, ʊ}}}}, the predecessors to {{angbr|{{IPA|ɩ, ɷ}}}}, were acknowledged as alternatives to {{angbr|{{IPA|ɩ, ɷ}}}} under the section "Other symbols". {{angbr|{{IPA|ɵ}}}} appeared as the rounded counterpart to {{IPA|[ə]}} rather than between {{IPA|[ø]}} and {{IPA|[o]}}.

The name of the column "Dental and alveolar" was changed to "Dental, alveolar, or post-alveolar". "Pharyngeal", "trill", "tap or flap", and "approximant" replaced "{{not a typo|pharyngal}}", "rolled", "flapped", and "frictionless continuants", respectively. {{angbr|{{IPA|ɹ, ʁ}}}}, which were listed twice in both the fricative and frictionless continuant rows in the previous charts, now appeared as an approximant and a fricative, respectively, while the line between the rows was erased, indicating certain fricative symbols may represent approximants and vice versa, with the employment of the raised and lowered diacritics if necessary. {{angbr|{{IPA|ʍ}}}}, previously defined as "voiceless {{IPA|'''w'''}}", was specified as a fricative. {{angbr|{{IPA|j}}}} remained listed twice in the fricative and approximant rows. {{angbr|{{IPA|ɺ}}}}, previously defined merely as "a sound between {{IPA|'''r'''}} and {{IPA|'''l'''}}", was redefined as an [[alveolar lateral flap]].

==1989 Kiel Convention==
[[File:IPA as of 1989.png|thumb|upright=2|The IPA in 1989. (Recreated from the 2005 chart. Some of the glyphs may not be accurate.)]]
By the 1980s, phonetic theories had developed so much since the inception of the alphabet that the framework of it had become outdated.{{sfnp|Ladefoged|Roach|1986}}{{sfnp|Ladefoged|1987a}}{{sfnp|Ladefoged|1987b}} To resolve this, at the initiative of IPA President [[Peter Ladefoged]], approximately 120 members of the IPA gathered at a convention held in [[Kiel]], [[West Germany]], in August 1989, to discuss revisions of both the alphabet and the principles it is founded upon.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1989a}} It was at this convention that it was decided that the ''Handbook of the IPA'' {{harv|International Phonetic Association|1999}} be written and published to supersede the 1949 ''Principles''.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1989a|p=69}}

In addition to the revisions of the alphabet, two workgroups were set up, one on computer coding of IPA symbols and computer representation of individual languages, and the other on pathological speech and voice quality.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1989a}}{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=165, 185}} The former group concluded that each IPA symbol should be assigned a three-digit number for computer coding known as IPA Number, which was published in {{harvp|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=161–185}}. The latter devised a set of recommendations for the transcription of disordered speech based on the IPA known as the [[Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet]] or extIPA, which was published in 1990 and adopted by the [[International Clinical Phonetics and Linguistics Association]], which now maintains it, in 1994.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=186}}

A drastically renewed chart of the alphabet reflecting decisions made at the convention appeared later in the year. Additions were:{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1989b}}

*Consonants
**{{angbr|{{IPA|ʙ}}}} for a [[voiced bilabial trill]]
**{{angbr|{{IPA|ʝ}}}} for a [[voiced palatal fricative]], with {{angbr|{{IPA|j}}}} now standing only for the approximant
**{{angbr|{{IPA|ʟ}}}} for a [[voiced velar lateral approximant]]
**{{angbr|{{IPA|ʄ, ʛ}}}} for voiced palatal and uvular implosives
**{{angbr|{{IPA|ƥ, ƭ, ƈ, ƙ, ʠ}}}} for voiceless implosives
**{{angbr|{{IPA|ʜ, ʢ}}}} for epiglottal fricatives
**{{angbr|{{IPA|ʡ}}}} for a [[voiced epiglottal plosive]]
**{{angbr|{{IPA|ǀ, ǃ, ǁ}}}} for dental, (post)alveolar, and alveolar lateral clicks, replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|ʇ, ʖ, ʗ}}}}, and {{angbr|{{IPA|ǂ}}}} for a palatal click (these new symbols were devised by {{harvnb|Lepsius|1855}} and had been adopted widely among linguists working on [[Khoisan languages]]){{sfnp|Köhler|Ladefoged|Snyman|Traill|1988}}
*Diacritics
**{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̰}}}} for [[creaky voice]]
**{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̼, ◌̺, ◌̻}}}} for [[Linguolabial consonant|linguolabial]], [[Apical consonant|apical]], and [[Laminal consonant|laminal]]
**{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̹, ◌̜}}}} for more and less rounded, now placed under the symbol
**{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̽}}}} for mid-centralized
**{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̘, ◌̙}}}} for [[advanced and retracted tongue root]]
**{{angbr|{{IPA|◌{{hairsp}}˞}}}} for [[R-colored vowel|rhoticity]]
**{{angbr|{{IPA|◌ʷ}}}} for [[labialization]], replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̫}}}}
**{{angbr|{{IPA|◌ʲ}}}} for [[palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]], replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̡}}}}
**{{angbr|{{IPA|◌ˠ, ◌ˤ}}}} for [[velarization]] and [[pharyngealization]]
**{{angbr|{{IPA|◌ⁿ, ◌ˡ}}}} for [[nasal release|nasal]] and [[lateral release (phonetics)|lateral release]]
**{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̯}}}} for [[Semivowel|non-syllabic]], replacing {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̆}}}}, which now stands for extra-short
*Suprasegmentals
**{{angbr|{{IPA|◌̆}}}}, which previously stood for non-syllabic, for [[extra-short]]
**{{angbr|{{IPA|.}}}} for a syllable break
**{{angbr|{{IPA|{{!}}, ‖}}}} for minor (foot) and major (intonation) groups
**{{angbr|{{IPA|‿}}}} for linking (absence of a break)
**{{angbr|{{IPA|↗, ↘}}}} for global rise and fall of pitch
**{{angbr|{{IPA|ꜜ, ꜛ}}}} for [[downstep]] and [[upstep]]

Tone, which had been indicated with an iconic line preceding the syllable or above or below the vowel, was now written one of two ways: with a similar iconic line following the syllable and anchored to a vertical bar, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|˥, ˦, ˧˩˨}}}} (Chao's [[tone letter]]s), or with more abstract diacritics written over the vowel (acute = high, macron = mid, grave = low), which could be compounded with each other, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|ə᷄, ə᷆, ə᷈, ə̋, ə̏}}}}.

The palato-alveolar column was removed and {{angbr|{{IPA|ʃ, ʒ}}}} were listed alongside the postalveolars. {{angbr|{{IPA|ɹ}}}} appeared at the same horizontal position as the other alveolars rather than slightly more back as did in the previous charts. {{angbr|{{IPA|ʀ}}}} was specified as a trill rather than either a trill or flap. The alternative raised and lowered diacritics {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̣, ◌̨}}}} were eliminated in favour of {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̝, ◌̞}}}}, which could now be attached to consonants to denote fricative or approximant, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|ɹ̝, β̞}}}}. Diacritics for relative articulation placed next to, rather than below, a letter, namely {{angbr|{{IPA|1=◌˖, ◌˗, ◌&lt;span style="font-family: serif; display: inline-block; {{transform|rotate(90deg) scaleY(0.5) translateX(0.2em)}}"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;, ◌˔, ◌˕}}}}, were no longer mentioned. The diacritic for no audible release {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̚}}}} was finally mentioned in the chart.

{{angbr|{{IPA|ɩ, ɷ}}}} were eliminated in favour of {{angbr|{{IPA|ɪ, ʊ}}}}. The symbol for the [[close-mid back unrounded vowel]] was revised from {{angbr|[[File:Latin letter small capital Gamma.svg|10px]]}} ("baby gamma"), with a flat top, to {{angbr|[[File:Ram's horns.svg|10px]]}} ("ram's horns"), with a rounded top, to better distinguish it from {{angbr|{{IPA|ɣ}}}}, which represents a [[voiced velar fricative]]. {{angbr|{{IPA|ɮ}}}} was revived in place of {{angbr|[[File:Lezh old.svg|8px]]}}. {{angbr|{{IPA|ɚ}}}} was no longer mentioned, and instead a right-hook diacritic {{angbr|{{IPA|˞}}}} was added for rhoticity (not attached to the letter, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|ə{{hairsp}}˞}}}}, unlike {{angbr|{{IPA|ɚ}}}}); the superscript rhotic diacritics were no longer mentioned.

{{angbr|{{IPA|ʆ, ʓ}}}} for palatalized {{IPA|[ʃ, ʒ]}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|ɼ}}}} for the [[alveolar fricative trill]] were withdrawn (now written {{angbr|{{IPA|ʃʲ, ʒʲ}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|r̝}}}}). The affricate ligatures were withdrawn. The tie bar below symbols for affricates and doubly articulated consonants, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|t͜s}}}}, was no longer mentioned. The practice of placing a superscript symbol to indicate the resemblance to a sound, previously illustrated by {{angbr|{{IPA|ʃˢ}}}}, was no longer explicitly recommended.

At the convention, proposals such as {{angbr|[[File:W with left hook.svg|12px]]}} for a voiced labial–velar fricative, {{angbr|[[File:L with reversed belt.svg|6px]]}} for a [[voiceless velar lateral fricative]], {{angbr|{{IPA|1=&lt;span style="{{mirrorH}}"&gt;ɮ&lt;/span&gt;}}}} for a [[voiced velar lateral fricative]], {{angbr|[[File:Turned Y with reversed belt.svg|8px]]}} for a [[voiceless palatal lateral fricative]], {{angbr|{{IPA|ŝ, ẑ}}}} for "the 'hissing-hussing' fricatives of some Caucasian languages", and {{angbr|{{IPA|ᴀ}}}} for an [[open central unrounded vowel]] were discussed but dismissed.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1989a|pp=72, 74}}

===New principles===
The six principles set out in 1888 were replaced by a much longer text consisting of seven paragraphs.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1989a}} The first two paragraphs established the alphabet's purpose, namely to be "a set of symbols for representing all the possible sounds of the world's languages" and "representing fine distinctions of sound quality, making the IPA well suited for use in all disciplines in which the representation of speech sounds is required".{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1989a|p=67}} The second paragraph also said, "{{IPA|[p]}} is a shorthand way of designating the intersection of the categories voiceless, bilabial, and plosive; {{IPA|[m]}} is the intersection of the categories voiced, bilabial, and nasal; and so on",{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1989a|p=68}} refining the previous, less clearly defined principle #2 with the application of the [[distinctive feature]] theory.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=37–8}} Discouragement of diacritics was relaxed, though recommending their use be limited to cases: "(i) For denoting length, stress and pitch. (ii) For representing minute shades of sounds. (iii) When the introduction of a single, diacritic obviates the necessity for designing a number of new symbols (as, for instance, in the representation of nasalized vowels)".{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1989a|p=68}} The principles also adopted the recommendation of enclosing phonetic transcriptions in square brackets [&amp;nbsp;] and phonemic ones in slashes /&amp;nbsp;/,{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1989a|p=68}} a practice that emerged in the 1940s.{{sfnp|Heitner|2003|p=326 n.&amp;nbsp;6}} The principles were reprinted in the 1999 ''Handbook''.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=159–60}}

==1993 revision==
[[File:IPA chart (C)2005.pdf|thumb|upright=1.5|The 2005 chart. There are only minor changes from 1993.]]
Following the 1989 revision, a number of proposals for revisions appeared in the ''[[Journal of the International Phonetic Association|Journal of the IPA]]'', which were submitted to the Council of the IPA. In 1993, the Council approved the following changes:{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1993a}}

*{{angbr|{{IPA|ƥ, ƭ, ƈ, ƙ, ʠ}}}} for the voiceless implosives were withdrawn.
*The non-pulmonic consonants (ejectives and implosives) were removed from the main table and set up with the clicks in a separate section, with {{angbr|{{IPA|ʼ}}}} acknowledged as an independent modifier for ejective (therefore allowing combinations absent in the chart).
*It was noted that subdiacritics may be moved above a letter to avoid interference with a descender.
*The alternative symbol for the mid central vowel {{angbr|{{IPA|ɜ}}}} was redefined as open-mid, and the one for the mid central rounded vowel {{angbr|{{IPA|ɵ}}}} as close-mid rounded. Two new vowel letters, {{angbr|{{IPA|ɘ}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|ʚ}}}}, were added, representing close-mid unrounded and open-mid rounded, respectively.
*The right half of the cell for pharyngeal plosives was shaded, indicating the impossibility of a voiced pharyngeal plosive.

On the same occasion, it was reaffirmed that {{angbr|{{IPA|ɡ}}}} and {{angbr|[[File:Looptail g.svg|8px]]}} are typographic alternatives.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1993a}}

The revised chart was now portrait-oriented. {{angbr|{{IPA|ə}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|ɐ}}}} were moved to the centerline of the vowel chart, indicating that they are not necessarily unrounded. The word "voiced" was removed from the definition for {{angbr|{{IPA|ʡ}}}}, now simply "[[epiglottal plosive]]". "Other symbols" and diacritics were slightly rearranged.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1993b}}

==1996 update==
In 1996, it was announced that the symbol for the [[open-mid central rounded vowel]] in the 1993 chart, {{angbr|{{IPA|ʚ}}}}, was a typographical error and should be changed to {{angbr|{{IPA|ɞ}}}}, stating the latter was the symbol which "[[J.&amp;nbsp;C. Catford]] had in mind when he proposed the central vowel changes&amp;nbsp;... in 1990", also citing {{harvp|Abercrombie|1967}} and {{harvp|Catford|1977}},{{sfnp|Esling|1995}} who had {{angbr|{{IPA|ɞ}}}}.{{sfnp|Abercrombie|1967|p=161}}{{sfnp|Catford|1977|pp=178–9}} However, the symbol Catford proposed for the value in 1990 was in fact {{angbr|{{IPA|1=&lt;span style="display: inline-block; {{transform|rotate(180deg) translateY(-0.2em)}}"&gt;ꞓ&lt;/span&gt;}}}} (a barred {{angbr|{{IPA|ɔ}}}}), with an alternative being {{angbr|{{IPA|ʚ}}}}, but not {{angbr|{{IPA|ɞ}}}}.{{sfnp|Catford|1990}} Errata for {{harvp|Catford|1990}} appeared in 1992&lt;!-- dated 1991 but published in 1992 --&gt;, but the printed symbol was again {{angbr|{{IPA|ʚ}}}} and the errata even acknowledged that {{angbr|{{IPA|ʚ}}}} was included in {{harvp|Association phonétique internationale|1921|pp=6–7}}, pointed out by [[David Abercrombie (linguist)|David Abercrombie]].{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1991}}

In the updated chart, the subsections were rearranged so that the left edge of the vowel chart appeared right beneath the palatal column, hinting at the palatal place of articulation for {{IPA|[i, y]}}, as did in all pre-1989 charts, though the space did not allow the back vowels to appear beneath the velars.{{sfnp|Esling|2010|p=697}} A tie bar placed below symbols, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|t͜s}}}}, was mentioned again. {{angbr|{{IPA|˞}}}} was now attached to the preceding letter, as in {{angbr|{{IPA|ə˞}}}}. A few illustrations in the chart were changed: {{angbr|{{IPA|a˞}}}} was added for rhoticity, and {{angbr|{{IPA|i̠, ɹ̩}}}} were replaced with {{angbr|{{IPA|e̠, n̩}}}}. The word "etc." was dropped from the list of tones.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=ix}}

==1999 ''Handbook''==
The 1999 ''Handbook of the International Phonetic Association'' was the first book outlining the specifications of the alphabet in 50 years, superseding the 1949 ''Principles of the IPA''. It consisted of just over 200 pages, four times as long as the ''Principles''. In addition to what was seen in the 1996 chart, which was reprinted in the front matter,{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=ix}} the book included {{angbr|{{IPA|ᵊ}}}} for mid central vowel release, {{angbr|{{IPA|ᶿ}}}} for voiceless dental fricative release, and {{angbr|{{IPA|ˣ}}}} for voiceless velar fricative release as part of the official IPA in the "Computer coding of IPA symbols" section.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=167, 170–1, 179}} It also said {{angbr|{{IPA|ᶹ}}}} "might be used" for "a secondary reduction of the lip opening accompanied by neither protrusion nor velar constriction".{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=17}} It abandoned the 1949 ''Principles''{{'}} recommendation of alternating {{angbr|[[File:Looptail g.svg|8px]]}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|ɡ}}}} for ordinary and advanced velar plosives, and acknowledged both shapes as acceptable variants.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=19}}

==21st-century developments==
In 2005, {{angbr|{{IPA|ⱱ}}}} was added for the [[labiodental flap]].{{sfnp|Nicolaidis|2005}}

In 2011, it was proposed that {{angbr|{{IPA|ᴀ}}}} be added to represent the [[open central unrounded vowel]], but this was declined by the Council the following year.{{sfnp|Keating|2012}}

In 2012, the IPA chart and its subparts were released under the [[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]].{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|2012}}

In 2016, three versions of a revised chart dated 2015 were released online, each with the phonetic symbols rendered in a different typeface (IPA Kiel/LS Uni developed by Linguist's Software, [[Doulos SIL]], and [[DejaVu Sans]]).{{sfnp|Keating|2016}}{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|2016}} No symbols were added or withdrawn, but some notes and the shapes of a few symbols were slightly modified. In particular, {{angbr|{{IPA|ə˞}}}} was replaced by {{angbr|{{IPA|ɚ}}}}, with a continuous, slanted stroke.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|2016}}

In 2018, another slightly modified chart in different fonts was released, this time also in [[TIPA (software)|TeX TIPA Roman]] developed by Rei Fukui, which was selected as best representing the IPA symbol set by the Association's Alphabet, Charts and Fonts committee, established the previous year.{{sfnp|Keating|2018}}{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|2018}}{{sfnp|Keating|2017}}

'''Jacob Baden''' (4 May 1735 – 5 July 1804), was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[philologist]], pedagogue, and critic. He was professor of rhetoric and the [[Latin]] language at [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1779. He was the first person to lecture on Danish grammar at the university between 1782 and 1783. He was the editor of the "University Journal" from 1793 to 1801.&lt;ref name="R1"&gt;[http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~fkarlsso/Hist_Ling_Nord.pdf The History of Linguistics in the Nordic Countries&amp;nbsp;– p.32 and p.56]&lt;/ref&gt;

He published a Danish grammar, [[Latin]] grammar, and also wrote an elementary [[Greek language|Greek]] grammar in 1764. He produced a Danish grammar in [[German language]] in 1767. His Danish grammar is well recognized till today.&lt;ref name="R1" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was born at [[Vordingborg]] on 4 May 1735. His father, who was also called Jacob Baden, was rector of the local [[latin school]]. His mother Else Jacobine née From was a daughter of county manager (''amtsforvalter'') From at ]]Antvorskov]]. He lost his father when he was 2 and was brought up by his mother. He enrolled at the [[University of Copenhagen]]  at age 15. He was a resident of [[på Ehlers' Kollegium]] after passing his theological exams.&lt;ref name="R4"&gt;[http://skeel.info/getperson.php?personID=I21438&amp;tree=ks Jacob Baden (1735–1804)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He later continued his studies at the [[University of Göttingen]] and [[University of Leipzig]].

==Personal life==
He married [[Charlotte Baden]], a [[Denmark|Danish]] writer in 1763. He died on 5 July 1804.&lt;ref name="R2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="R4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Thomas|title=The Universal Dictionary of Biography and Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U688e78e9wkC&amp;pg=PA239|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-61640-069-9|pages=239–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Junction Grammar''' is a descriptive model of language developed during the 1960s by [[Dr. Eldon G. Lytle]] (1936&amp;ndash;2010)[http://www.heraldextra.com/lifestyles/announcements/obituaries/article_cc7e75b8-42d8-5ac8-889e-6a6a58bf48b9.html].

Junction Grammar is based on the premise that the meaning of language can be described and precisely codified by the way language elements are joined together.

The model was used during the 1960s and 1970s in the attempt to create a functional computer-assisted translation system. It has also been used for linguistic analysis in the language instruction field.

==Background==
Early [[generative grammar]]s dealt with language from a ''syntactic'' perspective, i.e. as the problem presented by the task of creating  rules able to combine words into well-formed (i.e., ''grammatical'') sentences.  The rules used by these grammars were referred to as [[phrase-structure rule]]s (P-rules). It was soon apparent, however, that a generative component composed solely of P-rules could not generate a wide variety of commonly occurring sentence types. In response to this dilemma, we find Harris proposing an explanation:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''Some of the cruces in descriptive linguistics have been due to the search for a constituent analysis in sentence types where this does not exist'' '''because the sentences are transformationally derived from each other''' [boldface added]&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Zellig S. (1981). "Co-occurrence and transformation." In ''Papers in Syntax.'' Dordrecht: Reidel, 1 edition. ''Synthese language library,'' vol.14,  Henry Hiz, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chomsky’s model of syntax - [[transformational grammar]] -picked up on this line of reasoning and added a supplementary set of transformations (T-rules). T-rules effected combinations and permutations of words in step-wise fashion to fill in structural gaps where P-rules alone could not generate the sentences which Harris had pointed out as problems. The structural forms generated by P-rules alone were said to constitute ‘[[deep structure]].’ ‘Surface structure’ was then derived transformationally by T-rules from the ‘kernel’ structures first generated by the operation of P-rules. In this way, Chomsky proposed to generate an infinite number of sentences using finite means (the closed sets of P-rules and T-rules). Syntax-based models of this vintage set [[semantics]] and [[phonology]] apart as linguistic processes to be approached separately.

==Advent of Junction Grammar==
Enter from the sidelines under these circumstances  ''junction grammar'' (JG),&lt;ref&gt;Baird, Rey L. (1972) “Essentials of  Junction Grammar.”  ''LINGUISTICS SYMPOSIUM: AUTOMATIC LANGUAGE PROCESSING'', 30–31 March 1972. Provo, Utah : BYU Language Research Center. [http://www.junction-grammar.com/html/essentials.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; a model of natural language created by Eldon Lytle in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s.  Junction grammar did not propose an amendment to Chomsky’s model of syntax, but purported to eliminate the need for transformations altogether through theoretical innovation and a novel design for generative grammars. Innovations fundamental to the new approach rejected common-place reliance on existing mathematics and [[formal language]] theory as tools for linguistic modeling and description ''in deference to the intuition of more fundamental structuring in the body and in natural language itself'' which appeared to provide a ''universal base for linguistic description'' - not only for natural language but also for the synthetic notation systems employed at the time for linguistic description. Implementation of the novelties in question entailed:

* Recasting the generative component in a semantic mold. This entailed dispensing with all 'operationally-deprived' (and hence ''meaningless''&lt;ref&gt;Junction theory held that a simple concatenation of operands in linguistic formulations was as 'meaningless' as any string of mathematical operands devoid of operators.&lt;/ref&gt;) concatenations of P-rules and replacing them with ''junction rules'' (J-rules). J-rules operationalized for the first time a set of structural relations having universal syntacto-semantic significance and were based on the proposition that natural language ''has its own math''. Indeed, the position of JG was that lucubrations advanced by Chomsky and others as to whether this or that rung of a given formal language hierarchy was in principle capable of generating the sentences of natural language were ultimately circular, natural language being the womb which had mothered them all. Lytle held, in effect, that natural language is the ''meta-language'' upon which all forms of synthetic notation (including mathematics) supervene.&lt;ref&gt;Lytle, Eldon G. (1974) “A Summary Comparison of Junction Grammar and Transformational Grammar.” First published in ''LINGUISTICS SYMPOSIUM: AUTOMATED LANGUAGE PROCESSING'', 9 April 1974.  Republished in ''JUNCTION THEORY AND APPLICATION'', V. 2, no. 2, Spring 1979. Provo, Utah : BYU Translation Sciences Institute [http://www.junction-grammar.com/html/a_summary_comparison_of_jg_and.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complementing the base with biologically-oriented ‘tracts’ (sometimes referred to in early JG literature as ''levels of representation'') specializing in the distinct data types required to support lexicalization, articulation, orthography, etc.  Junction theory explicitly prohibited the intermingling of distinct data types in a single representation, noting, for example, that one could not reasonably expect the vocal tract to have use for 'semantic' data nor would the 'tract' executing movements in the writing hand have any use for data driving the musculature of the vocal tract.
* Implementing Saussure’s concept of ''signified-signifier'' linkages&lt;ref&gt;De Saussure, Ferdinand. ''Course in General Linguistics.'' (1966) New York:McGraw-Hill Book Company, 2 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; by constructing coding grammars to transpose the structuring of one tract to the data type of another, as for example the transposition of J-rule structuring into the lexical strings required for writing or articulation. The essence of the departure from Chomsky's model in this case was that ''coding'' between biologically grounded tracts supplanted ''interpretation'' of deep structure in the abstract.

In sum, the junction grammar model of language (1) moved the base into a sub-verbal semantic domain, (2) added universally relevant linguistic operators to generation rules - thus, for example, solving the quandary of how to handle 'conjunction' - (3) incorporated auxiliary  'tracts' together with specialized data types for voice, audition, etc., and (4) added coding grammars to physically interface between tracts.

[[File:levelsofrepresenation.png|frame|alt=JG Modular Components|left|Graphic depicting modular components and their interaction in a junction grammar.]]

===Transformations and Their Representations Are Superseded in JG===
''The right-left, top-down representational format which forced everything into one big tree was dispensed with in favor of an ensemble of interfacing representations which employed as many data-specific descriptions as necessary to capture the functionality of the diverse neurobiological manifestations of linguistic behavior being dealt with.'' Because target structuring was generable directly by the powerful J-rule base component and its array of linguistic operators, structure-oriented transformations required to combine kernel sentences and/or otherwise manipulate constituent structure were no longer required. Transformations formulated to generate correct word order and otherwise massage surface strings were supplanted by coding algorithms/grammars in the JG model.   It may be said by way of general comparison that, whereas Chomsky's model of syntax was by design ''derivative'' (speaking of its roots in existing forms of notation), ''derivational,'' and ''manipulative,'' the JG model was ''seminal'' (speaking of its formal novelty), ''modular,'' and  ''transpositional.'' Despite polar differences, however, ''Chomsky's objective of generating an infinite number of sentences with finite means, remained firmly intact in JG, as did the presumption of the fundamental innateness of natural language in the normal speaker/hearer.''

===J-rules===
The base/junction rules (J-rules) of junction grammars are a set of algebraic formulas which generate for natural language what is akin to the [[Periodic Table]] of elements in chemistry, namely, an enumeration of well-formed linguistic structures&lt;ref&gt;Melby, Alan K. 1985. “Generalization and prediction of syntactic patterns in junction grammar”. In ''Linguistics and Philosophy.'' Festschrift for Rulon S. Wells, Makkai, Adam and Alan K. Melby (eds.).&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as the ''Periodic Chart of Constituent structures'' (PCCS).&lt;ref&gt;See Lytle,Eldon G.(2009) ''LANGUAGE in Capital Letters'' (eBook edition), Chapters 4, 8.  Rose Valley, NV: Linguistic Technologies, Inc. [http://www.language-icl.com]&lt;/ref&gt; J-rules generate composite structures consisting of the labeled operands entering into them plus the relations established by operators, and assign a category to the composite produced, to wit: X ∘ Y ≐ Z. Composites thus generated become potential operands for subsequent operations. The resulting algebra may be represented in string form (e.g., infix, postfix, reverse polish) or graphed as a branching diagram (J-tree).

===Operators===
The universal operators utilized by these rules are ''subjunction'' (*), ''conjunction'' (&amp;), and ''adjunction'' (+), plus subtypes required under particular circumstances, e.g., restrictive (.*) versus non-restrictive (=*=) under subjunction. Expressed in more familiar terms, subjunction joins modifiers and complements to their heads, conjunction bonds constituents of homogeneous category which are in some respect similar, and adjunction&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with ‘Chomskyan adjunction.’&lt;/ref&gt; attaches relations and processes to their operands to form predicates, statements, and relational phrases. Supplemental operators effect the requirements of data management in [[mental model]]ing and conversational settings, corresponding in large part to the conventional classification of [[deixis]].&lt;ref&gt;Lytle, Eldon G. (1979) “Doing More with Structure.” ''JUNCTION THEORY AND APPLICATION'', V. 2, no. 2, Spring 1979. Provo, Utah : BYU Translation Sciences Institute. [http://www.junction-grammar.com/html/doing_more_with_structure.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operands===
The operands of the base are drawn from a dictionary of [[sememe]]s (meaningful concepts) which are by definition non-lexical in JG and may be plausibly viewed as electromagnetic signatures in their neurobiological setting&lt;ref&gt;See Presman, A.S. (1970) ''Electromagnetic Fields and Life.'' New York:Plenum Press, 1 edition. Translation of “Elektromagnitnye polia i zhivaia priroda” by F.L. Sinclair; edited by Frank A. Brown, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; arising in connection with the formation of the mental models which provide the content and sensory linkages for their meanings.

===Coding Grammars===
While the link between ''signified'' and ''signifier'' (as per Saussure) may be separately represented in a junction grammar, the interfacing between J-rule structuring and the coding extant in other components of the model is provided by context-sensitive coding grammars formulated as [[algorithm]]s in an appropriate [[pattern matching]] language. For example, JG incorporates a lexical coding grammar consisting of ''lexical rules'' (L-rules) which encodes unordered sememic structuring as ordered lexical strings in a separate coding space.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,  Billings, Floyd and  Thompson, Tracy (1972). “Proposals for Ordering Well-formed Syntactic  Statements.” ''LINGUISTICS SYMPOSIUM: AUTOMATIC LANGUAGE PROCESSING'', 30–31 March 1972. Provo, Utah: BYU Language Research Center.[http://www.junction-grammar.com/html/ordering_well-formed_syntactic.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent coding provides either the distinct patterning of the voice contour, or the formatting and punctuation of printed material.

===Nature of JG Analysis===
With the foregoing as a frame of reference, we draw renewed attention to significant differences between JG sentence analysis and conventional syntactic analysis. The more familiar syntax approach analyzes phrases and sentences in terms of outward ('surface') appearance, i.e. in terms of the words which they contain and how intuition groups them. Structural diagrams reflecting this method strive to depict constituent clusters in the word stream supplemented by labels, perhaps, or other information of focal interest to the analyst - some of it perhaps semantic. A change in word order requires that the diagram be changed.

In contrast, the JG approach, while taking note of the words, looks beyond them to the base constructions from which they have presumably been encoded, concentrating all the while on the semantic effects associated with the constituents and their structural nuances. JG diagrams (J-trees), therefore, are not directly representative of the word stream but, rather, of rational constructs in the neural mass having linkage with the words which we read or write. This means that a variety of structuring detail made explicit in J-trees is only implicit in the word stream. Conversely, it means that certain lexical detail made explicit in the word stream is only implicit in J-trees. For example, depending upon the ordering rules of the lexical coding grammar in play ''and'' the discourse context of the sentence - the same J-tree  may yield alternative word orders in the lexical coding space.

The overall effect - as previously noted - is that, inasmuch as JG uses ''coding'' rather than ''derivation'' as a bridge between levels of representation, much that models of syntax have been preoccupied with in deriving ''surface structure'' from ''deep structure'' (movement, deletion, insertion, etc.) is taken over in JG by coding operations.

==Early Application==
The first junction grammar was worked out by Eldon Lytle in connection with his Ph.D. dissertation during the late ‘60s,&lt;ref&gt;Lytle, Eldon G. (1972) ''Structural Derivation in Russian.'' Ph.D. Dissertation. University of Illinois, Champaign/Urbana&lt;/ref&gt; in which he constructed such a grammar for the analysis of structural derivation in Russian. That grammar relegated the data to four levels of representation, corresponding to:

# ''Level 1'' - ‘real world' structuring
# ''Level 2'' - syntacto-semantic structuring reflective of mental activity
# ''Level 3'' - lexical code transposed from ''Level 2''
# ''Level 4'' - articulatory/orthographic code transposed from ''Level 3''

Lytle employed one of the junction operators (subjunction) as a formal device to impose the properties of a governing category upon existing structure to obtain ‘derived’ forms (e.g., ‘transform-ation’ - '''Noun * Verb''').

==Early Literature==
Early literature on JG was published in ''Junction Theory and Application'', the journal of the BYU ''Translation Sciences Institute'' (TSI), and/or the proceedings of the University’s ''Annual Linguistic Symposium''.&lt;ref&gt;This symposium was sponsored in the early ‘70s either by TSI or the ''Language Research Center'' and subsequently by the ''Deseret Language and Linguistics Society.'' Materials published by these institutions have been catalogued and are currently available in the BYU Library.&lt;/ref&gt; More widely distributed overviews and analyses of junction theory first appeared in monograph form under Mouton’s ''Janua Linguarum Series'',&lt;ref&gt;Lytle, Eldon G. (1974). ''A Grammar of Subordinate Structures in English.'' Mouton (''Janua Linguarum: Series Practica, 175, Studia Memoriae Nicolai Van Wijk Dedicata''), The Hague, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by papers and research reports presented at LACUS forum proceedings&lt;ref&gt;Lytle, Eldon G. (1979) “Junction Grammar: Theory and Application.” ''THE SIXTH ANNUAL LACUS FORUM''. (Columbia, SC: Hornbeam Press, Incorporated)&lt;/ref&gt; and linguistic conferences abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Melby, Alan K. (1974) "Some Aspects of Junction Grammar."  Paper read as an invited lecture at the International Summer School of Computational Linguistics held in Pisa, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, others tested the model for applicability to natural languages distanced from English.  The latter studies applied junction analysis to particular languages of diverse families, including Finnish,&lt;ref&gt;Luthy, Melvin J. (1982) “Junction Grammar Analysis of Finnish Passives.” Ural-Altaic Yearbook 54. Gyula Decsy &amp; A.J.E. Bodrogligeti, eds. (Bloomington: Eurolingua)&lt;/ref&gt; Samoan,&lt;ref&gt;Baird, Rey L. (1974) "A Variable Recursive Mechanism in Samoan.'' Ph.D. Dissertation: Indiana University&lt;/ref&gt; Korean,&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Kwang Oo (1980) ''A Contrastive Analysis Between Korean and English Relative Clauses''. MA thesis: BYU&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Seiko T. (1972) A Comparison of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Subjunction in Japanese and English. MA thesis: BYU&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, Kenji (1973) Junction Grammar as Applied to Japanese Synthesis. MA thesis:BYU&lt;/ref&gt; and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;Gibb, Daryl K. (1970)  ''An application to mechanical translation of a variable recursive algorithm based on the operations of union and intersection.'' MA thesis: BYU&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese were added to this list in due course (see below) . Following these studies, it was concluded that the J-rules comprising the syntacto-semantic base of the model proffered a pool of structural possibilities from which all natural languages draw, but that none necessarily uses them all nor the same subset.

==Early NLP Application==
During the early ‘70s, at the urging and under the auspices of the Department of Defense, Lytle and a team of colleagues conducted research at  BYU in computer-assisted, human-interactive translation in which junction grammars were subjected to formalization&lt;ref&gt;Melby, Alan K. (1972). “A Formalization of Junction Grammar.” ''LINGUISTICS SYMPOSIUM: AUTOMATIC LANGUAGE PROCESSING'', 30–31 March 1972. Provo, Utah: BYU Language Research Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lytle, Eldon and Packard, Dennis (1974). “Junction Grammar as a Base for Natural Language  Processing.” First published in ''LINGUISTIC SYMPOSIUM: AUTOMATED LANGUAGE PROCESSING'', 9 April 1974.  Republished in ''JUNCTION THEORY AND APPLICATION'', V. 2, no. 2, Spring 1979. Provo, Utah: BYU Translation Sciences Institute)”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Theodore A. (1972). “Random Generation of Well-formed Syntactic  Statements.” ''LINGUISTICS SYMPOSIUM: AUTOMATIC LANGUAGE PROCESSING'', 30–31 March 1972. Provo, Utah: BYU Language Research Center.&lt;/ref&gt; and applied to the problem of English-Russian translation. When positive results evinced proof of concept and a software prototype, funds from the private sector were invested to develop and test a one-to-many system based on the same translation model in expanded form - in particular, translations were synthesized from J-trees of English obtained via human interaction into Russian, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Melby, Alan K. (1973) "Junction Grammar and Machine Translation." Paper read at the International Conference on Computational Linguistics held in Pisa, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just prior to his inauguration as president, Gerald Ford and an entourage of VIPS visited the development site to receive a briefing on the concept and progress of the work.

At the conclusion of this  endeavor, an alpha model of the software translated a book submitted for test purposes and yielded translations in the cited target languages. While significant post-editing was required, suggesting - among other improvements -  that a second, language-specific interaction may well improve the design, the utility of computers as a useful translation aid, both in standardizing the use of terminology and expediting the overall translation process had been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;ALP Systems, a private corporation subsequently acquired rights from BYU to commercialize the technologies developed under its computer-interactive translation research programs. ALP Systems later offered translation services as ALPNET.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Computer-translation Briefing for Gerald Ford.jpg|frame|alt=President Ford|left|Briefing for President Gerald Ford on the JG-based, one-to-many translation model. Eldon G. Lytle is at left.]]

==Junction Phonology==
JG adherents soon observed that the structural particulars of ''adjunction, conjunction,'' and ''subjunction'' are relevant beyond conventional linguistic structuring. More specifically, they lend themselves to such diverse structural scenarios as spousal interaction, departmental interaction in institutions, and a host of other real-world phenomena. In response to this observation, Lytle developed a method of phonological representation based on phonemic operands and junction operators.&lt;ref&gt;Lytle, Eldon G. (1976). “Junction Grammar as a Base for Dynamic Phonological Representation.” ''LANGUAGE &amp; LINGUISTICS SYMPOSIUM'', 22–23 March 1976. Provo, Utah: BYU Language Research Center.&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of representation was subsequently utilized as the basis for synthesizing speech contours which reflected the structure of the source text.&lt;ref&gt;Melby, Alan K., Strong,William J., Lytle, Eldon G., Millett, Ronald P. . (1976) "Evaluation of Rule-Generated Pitch Contours" Paper for the 92nd Acoustical Society of America Meeting&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melby, Alan K.  (1976) ''Pitch Contour Generation in Speech Synthesis: A Junction Grammar Approach.'' Ph.D. Dissertation, published as AJCL microfiche #60, Spring 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==
JG proved to be classroom friendly, not only because its base structures were more intuitive, comprehensive, and explicit than traditional forms of diagramming, but also because their connection to overt forms of language were straightforward. Students quickly picked up on the challenge presented by the structural predictions of the PCCS and undertook to assist in verifying them. Among the memorable sentence types brought forward in class to challenge instructors and the Chart were:

* ''Come on up from out of down in under there.''&lt;ref&gt;Lytle deemed this sentence - a verb followed by nine prepositions and particles - of sufficient interest to analyze in a published article. See Lytle, Eldon G.(1985) “Come on up.” ''LINGUISTICS AND PHILOSOPHY. Essays in honor of Rulon S. Wells.'' Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Co. [http://www.junction-grammar.com/html/come_on_up.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Watermelon is a fruit that you can eat, drink, and wash your face and hands in.''
* ''She drank more of her milkshake than I did of my exotic herbal tea.''&lt;ref&gt;Lytle  published a lengthy response to this challenge. See Lytle, Eldon G.(1975) “A Junction Grammar Analysis of Quantifiers.” ''IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE.'' BYU Translation Sciences Institute. [http://www.junction-grammar.com/html/jg_analysis_of_quantifiers.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies were conducted to determine whether exposure to the JG method of diagramming was useful as a point of reference in teaching/learning foreign languages. Olson and Tuttle found that the answer was affirmative.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Royden S. and Tuttle, David M. (1972) “The Effect of Language Trees on the Acquisition of Generative Capacity in a Foreign Language.” ''LINGUISTICS SYMPOSIUM: AUTOMATIC LANGUAGE PROCESSING'', 29–30 March 1972. Provo, Utah: BYU Language Research Center.[http://www.junction-grammar.com/html/the_acquisition_of_generative_.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Roydon S. (1980).''The Effect of Language Trees in Foreign Language Learning.'' Masters Thesis:BYU.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational software==
Subsequent to his experience with computer-assisted translation and voice synthesis, Lytle undertook the development of JG-based educational software in the private sector. To facilitate his objectives he designed what is referred to as ‘JG Markup Notation’ and created a [[pattern matching]] language (JGPL) to complement it.&lt;ref&gt;Lytle, Eldon G.(1987) ''JGPL User Manual.''  Gardnerville, NV: LinguisticTechnologies, Inc. Corporate document.&lt;/ref&gt; This endeavor relied on the escalating power of micro-computers to field JG-powered applications able to provide constructive feedback to student writers and their teachers in a writing-lab context.  The project culminated in a successful field test in a district of the public school system&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, Neldon C. and Lytle, E. G. (1986) “Field Test of the WordMAP(TM) Writing Aids System.” Panaca, NV. District document.&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately a study conducted jointly with the Educational Testing Service (ETS) to evaluate the potential of such software to holistically [[Automated essay scoring|score]] student written products. The joint conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...computer analysis of student ways can provide a level of detail in feedback to students, teachers, and others that is not possible using human readers alone.  This kind of feedback has important implications for instruction in English composition.  Moreover, computer analysis can provide detailed feedback on many written products, even lengthy ones; a teacher of English will normally provide detailed feedback on only a few brief essays.''&lt;ref&gt;Breland, Hunter M. and Lytle, Eldon G.(1990) “Computer-Assisted Writing Skill Assessment Using WordMAP (TM).” Paper presented at the Annual Meetings of the American Educational Research Association and the National Council on Measurement in Education. Boston, MA).[http://www.writinglab.com/brelandlytle.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In more recent research, Millett has independently demonstrated the ability of the same JG-based software to evaluate the writing of ESL students of mixed nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;Millett, Ronald P.(2006) ''AUTOMATIC HOLISTIC Scoring OF ESL ESSAYS USING LINGUISTIC MATURITY ATTRIBUTES.'' MA Thesis: BYU. [http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/762/]&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its demonstrated potential for educational assessment, overtures have been made to declare JGPL and its associated software applications - ''The WordMap Writing-Aids Software Ensemble'' - ‘open source’ so that it may serve as an expandable and adaptable public educational resource. This proposal is presently 'under advisement.' Meanwhile, to test the utility of JG-related writing assessment in an internet environment, the JGPL analysis engine has been made available free of charge for experimentation in an online writing-lab setting.[http://www.writinglab.com]

==Sample J-tree==
[[File:GlossedSentence.png|frame|alt=NetObjectsFusion utility|left| J-tree for "Students who apply themselves get good grades."]]

This tree was constructed in a tutorial setting equipped with experimental software for computer-aided JG diagramming. Note the explicit specification of junction operators on the squiggly lines connecting the node labels. This is one aspect of JG linguistic description which sets it apart from other models and from which its name derives. Conventional branching diagrams may also be used, but in any case the junction operator ''must'' be written between the nodes serving as its operands. ''Junction theory holds that linguistic structures written without junctions have no more meaning/substance than concatenations of algebraic operands written without any indication of the operations to be performed with them.'' Because of its algebraic format - and owing to its use of non-verbal formatives -  JG base description has of late been dubbed ''MindMath.''

==Review of Theoretical and Practical Highlights==
*As formerly noted, junction grammar does not analyze or describe natural language with respect to formal, synthetic languages (whether separately or arranged in some hierarchy), but considers all of these to be ‘derivative’ in the sense that they themselves are defined with reference to one natural language or another. Junction grammar construes this dependency upon natural language to mean that natural language is itself the meta-language upon which all formal, synthetic languages (including all forms of mathematics and computer programming languages) supervene. From this it follows that to analyze the meta-language with derivative tools is circular and can yield no more in a particular case than the subset of the source which it circumscribes. For this reason,  junction grammar holds that “natural language has its own math.” To discover the rudiments of this foundational math and expand upon it has been the objective of proponents since its inception.
* Junction theory further insists that natural language modeling be done with reference to the biology of the organism in which the language manifests. Grammars fashioned in this way use `levels’ of representation or ‘tracts’ in which purpose-specific transpositions of language occur and are separately coded in their peculiar data types - and must therefore be separately described. In a word, JG does not permit intermixture of data types in a single representation except where used to gloss correspondents in related tracts, i.e., to specify context-sensitivity between types.
*''Junction theory anticipates that the various interfaces between tracts and their respective coding grammars will correspond to linguistic R&amp;D now subsumed under distinct titles and demonstrate the utility of dealing with them as the integral components of a larger unified model.'' For example, the 'sememic' data of J-trees lacks the ambiguity and imprecision of lexical strings and is therefore an attractive candidate for use in rational forms of mental modeling. The construction of algorithms to encode this data type as lexical strings forces the analyst to confront the subtleties of morphology (e.g., word-building) and the logic of similarity and difference associated with the principles of semiotics.  By way of further illustration: The data type developed for the 'lexical coding space' (tract) of the JG model at its inception served readily as input to the coding algorithms required for voice synthesis (as described above). The overall perspective which emerged in this case was a trace from phonemic representation, to phonetic representation, to the computerized generation of wave forms simulating voice.  ''In sum, junction theory argues for the utility of operating from the perspective of a comprehensive, unified model with interlocking components - at least to the extent that the 'big picture' comes into focus.''

==Cross-Fertilization==
Some theoreticians have suggested that it would be productive to merge certain features of junction grammar with other models. Millett and Lonsdale, in fact, have proposed an expansion of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) to create junction trees.&lt;ref&gt;Millet, Ronald and Lonsdale, Deryle (2005).  “Expanding Tree Adjoining Grammar to Create Junction Grammar Trees.” ''Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Tree Adjoining Grammar and Related Formalisms'', pg. 162-170; BC, Canada: Simon Fraser University.  [http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/TAG+7/papers/millett.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==JG Upgrade Model==

===Orders of Specificity===

In planning for systematic expansion of the JG model of language, ‘elevator shafts’ were included in its original layout for the eventual incorporation of modules to deal with such phenomena as sensation, cognition, mental modeling, and communication - all of these being considered integral to the operation of language in its natural setting. Inasmuch as the addition of modules entails addition of data types and their dictionaries, reference was made in the literature to such future expansion as a function of `orders of specificity,' with each module or significant rule refinement ascending to a higher order, as it were.&lt;ref&gt;Lytle,Eldon G.,  “The Evolution of Junction Grammar” (1977). ''Translation Sciences Institute, '' Brigham Young University, September 1975, with minor revisions in April 1976,  and October, 1977. See `Orders of Specificity.’[http://www.junction-grammar.com/html/the_evolution_of_junction_gram.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===`LANGUAGE, THOUGHT, and REALITY'===
JG had - through its use of non-verbal data types - tacitly implemented Whorf’s expanded definition of language from its inception. To wit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...The linguistic order embraces all symbolism, all symbolic process, all process of reference and of logic...&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, John B., editor (1998)  ''Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf.''  THE MIT PRESS, pg. 248-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At that point where formal development of the module for ''Level 1'' (the `real’ world) was contemplated, it became apparent that JG was graduating from a model managing the connection between MIND and EXPRESSION as a matter of linkage between familiar and readily representable data types (e.g., between the sememic data of the ‘mind tract’ and those required for the 'vocal tract') ... to a model which must now also make explicit the connection between MIND and REALITY in a general way among a profusion of data types systematically written upon by MIND in the ‘cold and dreary’ world itself. The fact of the matter was that even though ''Level 1'' had been occupying space in the schematic from its inception, with the exception of voice synthesis, no ‘order of specificity’ had as yet been implemented in JG to formalize the linkage between sememic data and forms of physical reality.

[[File:WhorfFullModel.png|frame|alt=JG Upgrade Model|left|Graphic depicting Benjamin Whorf's Full Conceptual Model of Language.]]

That the linkage existed was simply a matter of observation: Each time an instruction was given and carried out, for example, the structuring specified by the instruction was realized in the physical media to which the terms of the language referred. Ditto for the relation between recipes and cakes, blueprints and houses, constitutions and governments, etc. In each case, the linguistic relations became real, with the referents to which they applied representing themselves - a circumstance referred to in the parlance of JG as ''reflexive symbolism''. As the ramifications of this scenario were examined, it became apparent that the emergent ‘JG Upgrade Model’ was now making direct contact with Benjamin Whorf’s full conceptual model, which saw structuring in the world at large as a ''physical'' extension of the language in MIND, while writing and speech - by way of comparison -  were ''rational'' extensions of language in MIND. To quote Whorf:

  &lt;blockquote&gt; All that I have to say on the subject that may be new is of the PREMONITION IN LANGUAGE of the unknown, vaster world - that world of which the physical is but a surface or skin, and yet which we ARE IN, and BELONG TO ... Speech is the best show man puts on ... But we suspect the watching Gods perceive that the order in which his amazing set of tricks builds up to a great climax has been stolen - from the  Universe! &lt;ref&gt;Carroll (1998), pg. 252&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here then was the explanation for the relevance of JG’s fundamental constituent relations to external relationships and the reason why Lytle had been able to represent articulatory structuring with junction operations. There is indeed a linguistic linkage between MIND and REALITY ... and hence, theoretically, a 'linguistic' description for every structured phenomenon. This, perhaps, portends the ultimate ascent of linguistic science to a level of prominence previously envisioned only by Whorf.  (We resume discussion of this eventuality below.)

===Linking to REALITY===
To formally implement the linkage in question as a feature of the JG Upgrade Model, it was necessary to add notational symbolism able to describe the nature of the coding which transpires at the MIND-REALITY interface. To this end, symbols were introduced to signify the mental processes which are used to create instruction and to apply it, as well as the act of describing such processes. To this end, corresponding operators were added to the JG inventory for:

* prescription (formula creation)
* inscription  (formula implementation)
* description  (discussion)

Other symbolism was incorporated to signify authorship (  '''''Kx'''''  ), as well as the language being employed ('''''Lx''''' ) vis-a-vis the ''language continuum'' (the global blend of ideolects,  dialects, and languages), as well as the data types operative as media to be structured in the physical domain  ('''''Mx''''').&lt;ref&gt;Lytle, Eldon G. (2009) ''LANGUAGE in Capital Letters'' (eBook edition), Chapt. 17. Rose Valley NV: Linguistic Technologies, Inc. [http://www.language-icl.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versatility of the Notation===
These notational addenda, when systematically organized and augmented with other pertinent formal devices, enable the linguist to write expressions for such diverse activities as mental modeling, conversation, putting one’s words into action, and use of the empirical method for discovery. Inasmuch as the system of classical junction rules can be derived directly from the new, more comprehensive symbolism, it is clear that the enhancements in question are a natural extension of the original model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7535">In [[linguistics]], '''lexical similarity''' is a measure of the degree to which the word sets of two given [[language]]s are similar. A lexical similarity of 1 (or 100%) would mean a total overlap between vocabularies, whereas 0 means there are no common words.

There are different ways to define the lexical similarity and the results vary accordingly. For example, [[Ethnologue]]'s method of calculation consists in comparing a standardized set of wordlists and counting those forms that show similarity in both form and meaning. Using such a method, [[English language|English]] was evaluated to have a lexical similarity of 60% with [[German language|German]] and 27% with [[French language|French]].

Lexical similarity can be used to evaluate the degree of [[Language family|genetic relationship]] between two languages. Percentages higher than 85% usually indicate that the two languages being compared are likely to be related [[dialect]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/introduction.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The lexical similarity is only one indication of the [[mutual intelligibility]] of the two languages, since the latter also depends on the degree of phonetical, morphological, and syntactical similarity. The variations due to differing wordlists weigh on this. For example, lexical similarity between French and English is considerable in lexical fields relating to culture, whereas their similarity is smaller as far as basic (function) words are concerned.  Unlike mutual intelligibility, lexical similarity can only be symmetrical.

==Indo-European languages==

The table below shows some lexical similarity values for pairs of selected Romance, Germanic, and Slavic languages, as collected and published by [[Ethnologue]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, lexical similarity data for [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=fra French], [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=deu German], [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=eng English]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Notes:''
*Language codes are from standard [[ISO 639-3]].
*Ethnologue does not specify for which [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] variety the lexical similarity was calculated. The answer could drastically change the data, since Ethnologue controversially considers Sardinian to be a [[macrolanguage]] by adding also two Sardo-Corsican transitional lects spoken in Sardinia (Corsican is in fact the closest lect to Tuscan and Italian of all in the Neolatin panorama). Based on the studies of Roberto Bolognesi and Wilbert Heeringa, the average divergence between the Sardinian language (without considering the aforementioned Corso-Sardinian lects) and Italian is around 48,7%, ranging from a minimum dialectal degree of divergence being 46,6% to the highest one of 51,1%.&lt;ref name="Bolognesi"&gt;[http://www.sardegnadigitallibrary.it/mmt/fullsize/2010011412224500014.pdf Bolognesi, Roberto; Heeringa, Wilbert. ''Sardegna fra tante lingue'', pp.123, 2005, Condaghes]&lt;/ref&gt; That would make the various dialects of Sardinian slightly more divergent from Italian than Spanish (with an average degree of divergence from Italian being around 46,0%) is.&lt;ref name="Bolognesi"/&gt;
*"-" denotes that comparison data are not available.
*In the case of English-French lexical similarity, at least two other studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finkenstaedt |first=Thomas |author2=Dieter Wolff  |title=Ordered profusion; studies in dictionaries and the English lexicon |publisher=C. Winter |year=1973 |isbn=3-533-02253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0029344700 |title=Joseph M. Willams, Origins of the English Language at |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimate the number of English words directly inherited from French at 28.3% and 41% respectively, with respectively 28.24% and 15% of other English words derived from Latin, putting English-French lexical similarity at around 0.56, with reciprocally lower English-German lexical similarities. Another study estimates the number of English words with an Italic origin at 51%, consistent with the two previous analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nation |first=I.S.P. |authorlink1= Paul Nation |date=2001|title=Learning Vocabulary in Another Language|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKqx8k8gYTkC|page=477|isbn=0-521-80498-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the three parts were enacted under the respective Malay states of Kelantan, (Taman Negara Enactment (Kelantan) 1938), Pahang (Taman Negara Enactment (Pahang) 1939) and Terengganu (Taman Negara Enactment (Terengganu) 1939), and hence came under the purview of the respective Sultans of the three states and the British High Commissioner. However, after Independence in 1957 “Taman Negara” came under the jurisdiction of the King (Yang Dipertuan Agong) and the respective Sultans of the three states. Administratively it was put under the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment and the administration and management came under the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, Peninsular Malaysia or PERHILITAN.

This informal geographical named remained until the 1980s when the quartz ridge was then better known as the Klang Gates Quartz Ridge or Permatang Kuarza Genting Kelang. On 24 June 2015 the Klang Gates Quartz Ridge was formally named the Gombak Selangor Quartz Ridge or Permatang Kuarza Gombak Selangor (PKGS) by the Selangor State Government.

The nominated site is built entirely of quartz, a natural mineral with chemical composition of silicon dioxide (SiO2), formed when residual magma crystallized and consolidated within vertical slab of dyke as the magma forced themselves through large linear fissures within massive granitic rock known as Kuala Lumpur Granite about 200 million years ago.

The most spectacular part of the quartz ridge is its protruding mid-section, which encompasses Taman Melawati, National Zoo (Zoo Negara) in the Ampang Jaya area and part of Selayang Municipal Area. From a distance, this section is said to resemble the guling ayam (cocks combs) or more dramatically, the spine of a dragon.

Pseudo-karst morphology comprising at least four shapes; the dome, table, ramp and tower may be observed on the Gombak Selangor Quartz Ridge.}}

|{{hidden|Information|The Royal Belum State Park, Perak Malaysia originally, was gazetted as Hutan Simpan Belum (Belum Forest Reserve) in 1971 and subsequently in 2007 it was regazetted in accordance with the Enakmen Perbadanan Taman Negeri Perak 2001 Sek. 6 (Section 6, Perak State Park Corporation Enactment 2001) as a State Park, stately called as the Crowning Glory of the Peninsula. In 2012, it was also gazzeted under the Enakmen Perhutanan Negeri Perak (Perak State Forestry Enactment) as well as National Heritage site which is the highest recognition accorded by the Government of Malaysia.

In the 1970s the importance of the Belum Forest Reserve was recognised for biodiversity conservation by the Colombo Plan Report and further recommendations for biodiversity conservation was made under the Third Malaysia Plan (1976-1980) and in 1988 by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, Peninsular Malaysia (PERHILITAN). The Royal Belum State Park borders the Halabala National Park, Thailand to the north, thus making the area of about 300,000 ha of a potential transfrontier park and the Peninsular Malaysian state of Kelantan on the east. The Royal Belum State Park was gazetted in May 2007 (Enakmen Perbadanan Taman Negeri Perak 2001 Sek. 6 No. 519) for biodiversity conservation to facilitate biodiversity education, research and ecotourism. The Royal Belum State Park is only accessible by boat via the public jetty at Pulau Banding (Banding Island) which is situated at the southern part of the State Park.

The total area of the Royal Belum State Park is 117,500 ha and straddles the northern undisturbed and pristine lowland dipterocarp, hill dipterocarp and lower montane forests (up to about 1,533 m above sea level) of northern Peninsular Malaysia forming the northern and strategic component of the Central Forest Spine (CFS). The State Park is considered as one of the oldest, protected, undisturbed and pristine land mass in Peninsular Malaysia of more than 130 millions years old, relics of the geological confluence of the southern Gondwanaland supercontinent and northern Laurasian supercontinent. Geographically, about 57% of its area is located in the range of 80-300 m above sea level and 41% in the range of 300-1,533 m above sea level. There is only one main river system, Sungai (River) Perak that originates from the Perak-Kelantan border in the north-east and flows southward to the Straits of Malacca at Bagan Datoh. Among the smaller rivers that are found in the State Park and drain most of the areas are Sungai Kenarong that originates on the west, Sungai Tiang and Sungai Kejar that originate on the east of the State Park, in addition to more than hundreds of smaller tributaries and streams that feed the Lake Temengor.

Geologically, the Royal Belum State Park is situated on the eastern side of the Western Belt of Peninsular Malaysia, right along the tectonic boundary of two continental plates (Sibumasu and East Malaya plates).  This area consists of diverse rock formations of mostly metamorphosed marine sedimentary rocks of Early Silurian-Devonian age (~ 440 to 400 m.y. ago) belonging to the Baling Group, and the Triassic granites. The igneous body intrusion that occurred in the Late Triassic age (ca. 220 m.y.) had lifted the area and became a land mass and physical landscape what we observed today. This intrusion and other related tectonic activities resulted from the collision of two supercontinental plates had shaped the area to what it is today as a metamorphed and uplifted Baling Group. This substratum has become the niche and habitats for the rich and diverse biodiversity in the State Park.}}

Throughout the [[history of literature]], since the creation of [[book binding|bound]] texts in the forms of [[books]] and [[codices]], various works have been published and written anonymously, often due to their political or controversial nature, or merely for the purposes of the privacy of their authors, among other reasons. This article provides a '''list of literary works [[anonymous work|published anonymously]]''', either attributed to "[[Anonymity|Anonymous]]", or with no specific author's name given.

Not included in this list are works which predate the advent of [[publishing]] and general attribution of authorship, such as ancient written inscriptions (such as hieroglyphic or pictographical, transcribed texts), certain historical folklore and myths of oral traditions now published as text, and reference or plain texts (letters, notes, graffiti) recovered archaeologically, which are otherwise unimportant to literary studies. [[Religious texts]] and [[grimoires]], which are often written anonymously, may appear, along with works initially written anonymously whose authors are now known.

This list is ordered alphabetically by title.

[[Image:Livingstone Stanley engraving.jpg|thumb|Monument engraving]]
The '''Livingstone–Stanley Monument''' at '''Mugere''' in [[Burundi]] is 12&amp;nbsp;km south of the capital [[Bujumbura]], overlooking [[Lake Tanganyika]], and marks a location where explorer and missionary Dr [[David Livingstone]] and journalist and explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] visited and spent two nights on 25–27 November 1871. In French it is referred to as ''La Pierre de Livingstone et Stanley''. Some Burundians claim the location is where the famous first meeting of Livingstone and Stanley took place, at which the latter uttered the famous words "Dr Livingstone, I presume?".

However that meeting actually took place in [[Ujiji]] in [[Tanzania]] on 10 November 1871 as clearly detailed in Stanley's book, "How I Found Livingstone".&lt;ref name=Stanley&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5157 Henry M. Stanley: ''How I Found Livingstone''] on Project Gutenberg website accessed 13 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; David Livingstone's journal also confirms Ujiji as the location, with an entry the day before the meeting reading "At dawn, off and go to Ujiji", a town he knew well. Livingstone then details meetings with several Arab residents of Ujiji including one who was supposed to be keeping his goods from his previous visit, before recording Stanley's arrival.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Livingstone]] and [[Horace Waller (activist)|Horace Waller]] (ed.): ''The Last Journals of David Livingstone in Central Africa from 1865 to his Death''. Two Volumes. John Murray, London, 1874. [Note that after several years out of contact with Europeans, Livingstone was out on the European calendar by 18 days because of the many days passed delirious with fever, and his servants did not keep a calendar. Until corrected by Stanley, he thought the date of the meeting was 24 October.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From their writings, the visit to Mugere appears to be the one on 25–27 November which Livingstone and Stanley described as being one of the most hospitable they enjoyed. The date 25 November 1871 can be seen scratched on the rock. They had rested in Ujiji for six days, and then set off by canoe up the north-east shore of the lake to explore rivers which might flow out of the Lake Tanganyika. At the Mugere River they found the village of Chief Mukropeans to visit the area, their arrival was memorable, and it must be at some time later the event became confused in some people's minds as the first meeting between Livingstone and Stanley. A number of websites make this wrong claim.

'''Mr. Bill''' is a clay [[figurine]] [[clown]] star of a [[parody]] of children's shows, created by [[Walter Williams (comedian filmmaker)|Walter Williams]].  Mr. Bill got its start on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as a series [[Super 8 film]] sent in response to the show's request for [[home movies]] during the [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|first season]]. Mr. Bill's first appearance occurred on the February 28, 1976, episode. After five submitted films, Williams became a full-time writer for the show in [[Saturday Night Live (season 4)|1978]], and would ultimately write more than 20 sketches based on Mr. Bill.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
[[File:SNL MrBill Doll.jpg|thumb|A rubber doll representing the "Mr. Bill" character.  This particular doll has been a travel mascot for 10 years and so is quite battered. The head has been cyanoacrylate-glued back onto the body, after suffering a Mr. Bill-like accident.]]

Each Mr. Bill episode would start innocently enough but would quickly turn dangerous for Mr. Bill. Along with his dog, Spot, he would suffer various indignities inflicted by "Mr. Hands,"&lt;ref name="imdb-20th-anniv"&gt;{{cite web
  | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892883/
  | title = Oh Noooooo! It's Mr. Bill's 20th Anniversary (1995)
  | work = [[Internet Movie Database]]
  | accessdate = 2008-06-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt; a man seen only as a pair of hands (originally performed by [[Vance DeGeneres]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/09/01/Ohhhhh-noooooooo-Mr-Bill-lives/2342525931200/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the abuse would ostensibly come from the mean Sluggo, another clay character. The violence would inevitably escalate, generally ending with Mr. Bill being crushed or dismembered while squealing in a high pitched voice, "Ohhhh noooooooooooooo...".  The concept for Mr. Hands came from Williams' observation that children's cartoons in the 70s were so static, he expected the artist's hands to enter the screen at any moment and physically start moving the drawings around.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Bill-Show-Walter-Williams/dp/0894710850|title=The Mr. Bill Show|last=Williams|first=Walter|date=1998-08-01|publisher=Running Pr|isbn=9780894710858|location=Philadelphia|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial ''Saturday Night Live'' sketches featuring Mr. Bill were self-contained episodes with no direct continuity, with the earliest installments featuring higher pitched character voices. After Walter Williams joined ''SNL'''s writing staff in 1978, Mr. Bill formally moved to New York at the start of the season. Later sketches saw Mr. Bill become aware of Mr. Hands and Sluggo's mistreatment, with [[Saturday Night Live (season 5)|the 1979-80 season]] harboring an extended story arc where Mr. Bill lost his home, sought psychiatric help, attempted to get Mr Hands and Sluggo arrested, and was ultimately thrown into prison.

Though Williams left ''Saturday Night Live'' after that season, Mr. Bill returned for a Christmas short film in [[Saturday Night Live (season 6)|December 1980]], as well as the sixth-season finale, where guest [[Chevy Chase]] found Mr. Bill in a garbage can. The last Mr. Bill sketch on ''SNL'' aired early in [[Saturday Night Live (season 7)|the 1981-1982]] season, where Mr. Bill moved to [[Los Angeles]]. After ''SNL'', Mr. Bill has subsequently appeared on numerous other television programs and advertisements, including regular new sketches on the [[USA Network]] series ''[[Night Flight (TV series)|Night Flight]]'' in the 1980s.

==Film==
The character's popularity spawned the 1986 live-action Showtime [[television film]] ''[[Mr. Bill's Real Life Adventures]]'', with [[Peter Scolari]] as Mr. Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Rosenberg |title=The First Arrivals on the Home Front |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/58024463.html?dids=58024463:58024463&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+10%2C+1986&amp;author=HOWARD+ROSENBERG&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=THE+FIRST+ARRIVALS+ON+THE+HOME+FRONT&amp;pqatl=google |work=Los Angeles Times |page=1, Calendar section |date=1986-09-10 |publisher= [[ProQuest]]|accessdate=2015-03-17 |quote= And 'Mr. Bill's Real Life Adventures' is a clunker Showtime special starring Peter Scolari as a real-life version of the ever-clobbered 10-inch clay character of long-ago 'Saturday Night Live' fame.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new Mr. Bill short film entitled ''Mr. Bill Goes To Washington'' premiered in theaters in 1993, preceding the movie ''[[Ernest Rides Again]]''. The short, which sees Mr. Bill elected as [[President of the United States]], was also featured on the ''Ernest Rides Again'' home video release.

Two new Mr. Bill home videos were released in the mid-1990s featuring new content, including 1996's ''"Ohh Nooo!!! It's Mr. Bill's 20th Anniversary"'', and 1997 straight-to-video ''Ho Ho Noooooo!!! It's Mr Bill's Christmas Special!'', the latter featuring a guest appearance by former SNL contributor [[Don Novello]] as [[Father Guido Sarducci]].

==Advertising ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
* In the 1980s, Mr. Bill was featured in advertising spots for [[Pringles]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In 1988, Mr. Bill also appeared in a series of anti-drug announcements which showed him engaging in various activities until Sluggo would bury him under a bunch of pills, in which the tagline would be "Say ''OH NO!'' to drugs".{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
* In the 1990s, Williams created ''[[The Pizza Head Show]]'', a series of Mr. Bill-like advertising spots for [[Pizza Hut]], featuring "Pizza Head" in the usual Mr. Bill role and a [[pizza cutter]] named "Steve" in the Sluggo role.
* Mr. Bill appeared{{when|date=March 2015}} in a [[Burger King]] commercial where Mr. Hands tells Mr. Bill that Burger King changed their Whopper. Mr. Bill was upset about the loss of his favorite burger, but Mr. Hands tells him that the new Whopper was bigger than [[McDonald's]] [[Big Mac]] or [[Wendy's]] Single. Mr. Hands sends Mr. Bill into the restaurant and gives him one. Mr Bill loves the Whopper and asks for another one. Mr. Hands agrees but he says it's on him and drops the Whopper box onto Mr. Bill, crushing him.
* Beginning in June 2008, [[MasterCard]] enlisted Mr. Bill for one of its [[MasterCard#Priceless|"Priceless" ads]]. The commercial starts with Mr. Bill being served coffee by Mr. Hands (coffee: $2). Mr. Hands fills the cup too much causing the coffee to spill all over the floor and Mr. Bill, but Mr. Bill takes it with good nature, saying, "I always wanted brown shoes. Yay!" Next, Mr. Hands tells Mr. Bill at a gym, "Your fitness instructor says to take it up a notch. [gym membership: $59]" He turns the treadmill all the way up and drops Mr. Bill on it, causing him to fly across the gym. Luckily, Mr. Bill lands safely on a stationary bike, where he says, "Hey! There's a bike open!" Next, Mr. Bill is seen in his luxurious office, where Mr. Hands helps him unpack his suitcase (suitcase: $120). When the suitcase opens, it knocks into Mr. Bill, sending him flying out the window. He lands on the windshield of a bus, where he remarks, "Hey, the bus is right on schedule!" He is then knocked off the bus by its windshield wipers as the commercial ends (Getting through the day: Priceless).&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite news  | first = Wendy A.  | last = Lee  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/business/media/03adco.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin  | title = Mr. Bill Returns (in One Piece) to Pitch a Debit Card  | work = [[New York Times]]  | date = June 3, 2008  | accessdate = 2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In December 2008, Mr. Bill became one of [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]'s spokesmen, along with Mr. Hands. In the commercial, Mr. Bill learns how to make bread with Mr. Hands, but suddenly Chef Sluggo comes in to roll the dough. But Sluggo never gets a chance to hurt Mr. Bill, as a boulder comes and crushes the whole Subway restaurant with both characters inside. When Mr. Hands finds Mr. Bill flattened with the dough on the side of the boulder, he says, "Great idea, Mr. Bill! Flatbread!"
*In 2011, Mr. Bill was in a commercial for [[Wonderful Pistachios]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Other appearances == 
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
* Mr. Bill also made a cameo appearance during the 1981 "Get High On Yourself" [[NBC-TV]] anti-drug campaign.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Mr. Hands suggests to Mr. Bill that he try getting high on himself. Mr. Bill agrees, and the camera pulls back to reveal that Mr. Bill is lashed to the exterior of a NASA [[Space Shuttle]]. As it lifts off, he cries "Oh noooooo...".
* In 1983, [[Data Age]] had plans to release a Mr. Bill video game, ''Mr. Bill's Neighborhood'', for the [[Atari 2600]] in April 1983, but the game was cancelled despite being finished. It would have been the first Mr. Bill video game if it had been released. No prototypes or ROMs of the game are known to exist.
* With Comedy Central producing many "We're all going to die" promos{{clarify|date=June 2016}} in the early 1990s, Mr. Bill starred in one of them, featuring him in a powder room explaining how making movies can be dangerous, but the real world can be more dangerous, so he reminds us to always be careful. Mr. Hands tells Mr. Bill the crew need him on the set and has to blow dry his hair, resulting in Mr. Bill's entire face melting. {{cite web|title=We're All Going to Die Comedy Central commercial with Mr. Bill|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2hdivl}}
* In 1998, Mr. Bill appeared in ''[[Ohh Nooo! Mr. Bill Presents]]'' on the [[ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]]. As well as featuring typical Mr. Bill-type sketches, other sketches, including [[Mr. Bean]] and separately [[The Baldy Man]] ([[Gregor Fisher]]), were present in the one-hour variety show.
* In 2004, Mr. Bill was part of a campaign aimed at teaching people, especially children, about the loss of [[Louisiana]]'s [[Salt marsh|coastal marshes]] and [[swamp]]s. On May 27, 2004 CNN showed a segment with Mr. Bill being 'evacuated' from a New Orleans roof the year before [[Hurricane Katrina]]. {{cite web|title=Mr. Bill: Hurricane Sluggo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsAvG3tXYXk}}
* The March 29, 2010, episode of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' featured a category called "Mr. Bill Plays the Bard".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3353&lt;/ref&gt; The category featured the character portraying various [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearian]] characters in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] [[Sketch comedy|vignettes]], who, like the sketches, all met their untimely demise.
*On September 23, 2010, an official Mr. Bill [[iPhone]] game was launched on Apple's App Store by [[Capcom]].
*The October 22, 2010, episode of the CBS drama ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]'', featured Mr. Bill being abused by the show's principal character during the opening dream sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Medium Watch: Talk To The Hand | first=Patrick |last=Hodges | url= http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Medium-Watch-Talk-Hand-27735.html | accessdate= 2015-03-17| publisher= CinemaBlend | quote= For those of you who weren’t around when ''Saturday Night Live'' first started in 1976, Mr. Bill was a clay figurine who was the star of a series of short skits that was meant to be a parody of kiddie shows. He had a high-pitched voice, and usually met some kind of sadistically violent end at the hands of… well, “Mr. Hands”, a pair of human hands (complete with voiceover) that would proceed to squash or dismember Mr. Bill and his little clay friends, eliciting Mr. Bill’s trademark cry, “Ohhh nooooooooo…” Tonight’s ODS seems to be a perfect mimicry of one of those shorts, except that Mr. Hands this time is actually Mrs. Hands (Allison), who tortures Mr. Bill for a minute or so before accidentally spilling boiling water on her left hand.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A segment of "Western Hay Batch", a Season 8 episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', shows Mr. Bill finally getting revenge on Mr. Hands and Sluggo. After flattening Mr. Bill with a [[rolling pin]] despite being warned not to, Mr. Hands remarks that his clay was not as flexible as usual. Mr. Bill then triumphantly reveals the reason: He is now composed of [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]]. Mr. Bill then explodes, vaporizing Sluggo and blasting both of Mr. Hands' hands off.
* In 1979, [[Running Press]] published a book titled ''The Mr. Bill Show'' with a red [[Flexi disc|soundsheet]] featuring the voices and sound effects of the show. The story is the origin of Mr. Bill in a series of snaps from a photo album (adding that his father was in vaudeville suffering the same indignities that Mr. Bill now suffers, and that he died when Mr. Bill was born, being decapitated in a freak accident). After several assaults are made on him by Sluggo and Mr. Hands during his childhood, Mr. Bill starts to get suspicious and tells Mr. Hands that he does not seem to have been a good friend after all, and gets smashed in the photo album.

'''Natalia Andreyevna O'Shea''' ({{lang-ru|Ната́лья Андре́евна О’Шей}}, née '''Nikolayeva''', {{lang-ru|Николаева}}, known as '''Hellawes'''; born 3 September 1976) is a Russian [[Irish harp|harpist]], singer-songwriter, linguist and band leader of "[[Melnitsa]]" ([[folk-rock]]), "[[Clann Lir (band)|Clann Lir]]" (traditional [[Celtic folk]]) and "Romanesque" ([[Folk music|folk]]). Earlier she took part in the "Till Eulenspiegel" project ([[Folk music|folk]]), for which she was a vocalist, author and co-author of many songs.

==Biography==
O'Shea is a linguist, and expert in [[Indo-European languages]] especially [[Celtic languages]]. She is also a PhD of philological science and was an instructor in [[Lomonosov Moscow State University]].

Natalia has been living and working in [[Ireland]] ([[Dublin]]) and in [[Switzerland]] ([[Geneva]]) since 2004, but periodically she returns in [[Russia]] to take part in concerts of "[[Melnitsa]]", "[[Clann Lir (band)|Clann Lir]]" or in solo concerts.

O'Shea has been appearing on the stage since 1998. She is one of the most popular folk-rock singers on the Russian scene and cult author-performer in the youth (and especially in student) midst of Moscow, Saint-Petersburg and other cities. Also she is a very popular singer for the players of ''role-playing game movement''.

The Hellawes's songs have spread through the [[Internet]] and have won recognition of listeners long ago in many cities of Russia and outside.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4723">'''Neo-Sovietism''' is the [[Soviet Union]]-style of policy decisions in some [[Post-Soviet states]], as well as a [[political movement]] of reviving the [[Soviet Union]] in the modern world or to reviving specific aspects of Soviet life based on the [[nostalgia for the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Heathershaw2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Heathershaw|title=Post-Conflict Tajikistan: The Politics of Peacebuilding and the Emergence of Legitimate Order|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CkZMU9srK7IC&amp;pg=PA63|date=7 May 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-01418-7|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shevtsova2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lilia Shevtsova|title=Russia--lost in Transition: The Yeltsin and Putin Legacies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7giTPNSJx3cC&amp;pg=PA200|year=2007|publisher=Carnegie Endowment|isbn=978-0-87003-236-3|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have said that current [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] holds many neo-Soviet views, especially concerning law and order and military strategic defense.&lt;ref&gt;Slade, G [http://www.sras.org/news2.phtml?m=633 Deconstructing the Millennium Manifesto: The Yeltsin-Putin Transition and the Rebirth of Ideology] ''The School of Russian and Asian Studies'',  2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Sovietism in Russian state policies==
According to Pamela Druckerman of ''[[The New York Times]]'', an element of Neo-Sovietism is that "the government manages civil society, political life and the media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Russians Love Their Children, Too|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/09/opinion/druckerman-the-russians-love-their-children-too.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2014-05-08|access-date = 2015-12-27|issn = 0362-4331|first = Pamela|last = Druckerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Mathew Kaminski of [[The Wall Street Journal]], in includes efforts by Putin to express the glory of the Soviet Union in order to generate support for a "[[Eurasia#Geopolitics|revived Great Russian power in the future]]" by bringing back memories of various Russian accomplishments that legitimatized Soviet dominance, including the Soviet victory against [[Nazi Germany]]. Kaminski continues on by saying that Neo-Sovietism "offers up Russian jingoism stripped bare of Marxist internationalist pretenses" and uses it to scare Russia's neighbours and to generate [[Russian nationalism|Russian patriotism]] and [[anti-Americanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Putin's Neo-Soviet Men|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304256404579451333189423754|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-12-27|issn = 0099-9660|first = Matthew|last = Kaminski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Meier of the [[Los Angeles Times]] in 2008 listed three points that laid out Neo-Sovietism and how modern Russia resembles the Soviet Union: First was that Russia was a land of [[doublespeak]]. Meier claims that Russia has deliberately distorted words and facts on various subjects, particularly regarding the [[Russo-Georgian War]] at the time by claiming that the [[United States]] instigated the conflict and that [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] was committing [[genocide]] in [[South Ossetia]]. Second was that Russia was willing to enhance its power by any means possible, including harsh repression of its own citizens with examples being [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] and the [[Mothers of Beslan]]. Lastly, Russia remains a land in which "fear of the state -- and its suffocating reach -- prevails" by introducing numerous laws that limit free expression and promote [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is the Soviet Union back?|url = http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oew-meier-moynihan29-2008aug29-story.html|website = latimes.com|accessdate = 2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsANoun.htm Glossary of linguistic terms: What is a noun?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lexical categories (parts of speech) are defined in terms of the ways in which their members combine with other kinds of expressions.  The [[syntactic]] rules for nouns differ from language to language. In [[English language|English]], nouns are those words which can occur with [[article (grammar)|articles]] and [[adjective|attributive adjectives]] and can function as the [[head (linguistics)|head]] of a [[noun phrase]].

== History &lt;span id="Substantive as a word for noun"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;==
{{hatnote|See also [[Part of speech#History|History of parts of speech]]}}
[[Word class]]es (parts of speech) were described by [[Sanskrit]] grammarians from at least the 5th century BC. In [[Yāska]]'s ''[[Nirukta]]'', the noun (''nāma'') is one of the four main categories of words defined.&lt;ref name=Matilal&gt;[[Bimal Krishna Matilal]], ''The word and the world: India's contribution to the study of language'', 1990 (Chapter 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek]] equivalent was ''ónoma'' (ὄνομα), referred to by [[Plato]] in the [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialog]], and later listed as one of the eight parts of speech in ''[[The Art of Grammar]]'', attributed to [[Dionysius Thrax]] (2nd century BC). The term used in [[Latin grammar]] was ''nōmen''. All of these terms for "noun" were also words meaning "name".&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|nomen|nōmen|ref}}; {{LSJ|o/noma|ὄνομα|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English word ''noun'' is derived from the Latin term, through the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''noun''.

The word classes were defined partly by the grammatical [[morphology (linguistics)|forms]] that they take. In Sanskrit, Greek and Latin, for example, nouns are categorized by [[grammatical gender|gender]] and inflected for [[grammatical case|case]] and [[grammatical number|number]]. Because [[adjective]]s share these three [[grammatical category|grammatical categories]], adjectives are placed in the same class as nouns.&lt;br /&gt;

Similarly, the Latin ''nōmen'' includes both nouns (substantives) and adjectives, as originally did the English word ''noun'', the two types being distinguished as ''nouns substantive'' and ''nouns adjective'' (or ''substantive nouns'' and ''adjective nouns'', or short ''substantives'' and ''adjectives''). (The word ''[[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]]'' is now sometimes used to denote a class that includes both nouns and adjectives.)

Many European languages use a [[cognate]] of the word ''substantive'' as the basic term for noun (for example, Spanish ''[[wikt:sustantivo|sustantivo]]'', "noun"). Nouns in the dictionaries of such languages are demarked by the abbreviation ''s.'' or ''sb.'' instead of ''n.'', which may be used for proper nouns or neuter nouns instead. In English, some modern authors use the word ''substantive'' to refer to a class that includes both nouns (single words) and [[noun phrase]]s (multiword units, also called noun equivalents).&lt;ref name="CMOS"&gt;{{Citation |author = Chicago Manual of Style |authorlink = The Chicago Manual of Style |title = The Chicago Manual of Style |section = 5.10: Noun-equivalents and substantives |publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] |url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/ch05/ch05_sec010.html |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as a counterpart to ''attributive'' when distinguishing between a noun being used as the [[head (linguistics)|head]] (main word) of a noun phrase and a noun being used as a [[noun adjunct]]. For example, the noun ''knee'' can be said to be used substantively in ''my knee hurts'', but attributively in ''the patient needed knee replacement''.

== Definitions ==

Nouns have sometimes been defined in terms of the grammatical categories to which they are subject (classed by gender, inflected for case and number). Such definitions tend to be language-specific, since nouns do not have the same categories in all languages.

Nouns are frequently defined, particularly in informal contexts, in terms of their [[semantics|semantic]] properties (their meanings). Nouns are described as words that refer to a ''person'', ''place'', ''thing'', ''event'', ''substance'', ''quality'', ''quantity'', etc. However this type of definition has been criticized by contemporary linguists as being uninformative.&lt;ref name=jackendoff&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackendoff|first=Ray|authorlink=Ray Jackendorff|date=2002|title=Foundations of language: brain, meaning, grammar, evolution|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://npu.edu.ua/!e-book/book/djvu/A/iif_kgpm_Foundations%20of%20Language.pdf|isbn= 0-19-827012-7|chapter=§5.5 Semantics as a generative system}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been offered several examples of English-language nouns which do not have any reference: ''drought'', ''enjoyment'', ''finesse'', ''[[wikt:behalf|behalf]]'' (as found in ''on behalf of''), ''[[wikt:dint|dint]]'' (''in dint of''), and ''[[wikt:sake|sake]]'' (''for the sake of'').&lt;ref&gt;pages 218, 225 and elsewhere in {{cite book|last=Quine|first=Willard Van Orman|title=Word and Object|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=MIT Press|date=2013|origyear=1960 print|chapter=7 Ontic Decision|pages=215–254|authorlink=Willard Van Orman Quine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reference/#NonRefExp |title=Reference §3.4 Non-Referring Expressions |last1=Reimer |first1= Marga|last2= |first2= |date=May 20, 2009 |website= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2010 Edition)|editor1-first=Edward N. |editor1-last=Zaita|publisher= |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:Appendix:English nouns with restricted non-referential interpretation in bare noun phrases|English nouns with restricted non-referential interpretation in bare noun phrases]]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there may be a relationship similar to reference in the case of other parts of speech: the verbs ''to rain'' or ''to mother''; many adjectives, like ''red''; and there is little difference between the adverb ''gleefully'' and the noun-based phrase ''with glee''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Nouns occur in idioms with no meaning outside the idiom: ''rock and roll'' does not describe two different things named by ''rock'' and by ''roll''; someone who falls for something ''lock, stock and barrel'' does not fall for something ''lock'', for ''stock'', and for ''barrel''; a trick using ''smoke and mirrors'' does not separate into the effect of ''smoke'' and each ''mirror''. See [[hendiadys]] and [[hendiatris]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are [[placeholder names]], such as the [[legal fiction]] ''[[reasonable person]]'' (whose existence is not in question), an experimental ''[[Artifact (error)|artifact]]'', or [[Anthropomorphism|personifications]] such as ''[[gremlin]]''.

[[Linguistics|Linguists]] often prefer to define nouns (and other lexical categories) in terms of their formal properties. These include [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] information, such as what [[prefix]]es or [[suffix]]es they take, and also their [[syntax]]&amp;nbsp;– how they combine with other words and expressions of particular types. Such definitions may nonetheless still be language-specific, since syntax as well as morphology varies between languages. For example, in English it might be noted that nouns are words that can co-occur with definite articles (as stated at the start of this article), but this would not apply in [[Russian language|Russian]], which has no definite articles.

There have been several attempts, sometimes controversial, to produce a stricter definition of nouns on a semantic basis. Some of these are referenced in the {{slink||Further reading}} section below.

== Gender ==
{{main article|Grammatical gender}}

In some languages, genders are assigned to nouns, such as masculine, feminine and neuter. The gender of a noun (as well as its number and case, where applicable) will often entail [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] in words that modify or are related to it. For example, in [[French language|French]], the singular form of the definite article is ''le'' with masculine nouns and ''la'' with feminines; adjectives and certain verb forms also change (with the addition of {{nowrap|''-e''}} with feminines). Grammatical gender often correlates with the form of the noun and the inflection pattern it follows; for example, in both [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] most nouns ending {{nowrap|''-a''}} are feminine. Gender can also correlate with the [[sex]] of the noun's referent, particularly in the case of nouns denoting people (and sometimes animals). Nouns arguably do not have gender in Modern English, although many of them denote people or animals of a specific sex (or ''social gender''), and pronouns that refer to nouns must take the appropriate gender for that noun. (The '''girl''' lost '''her''' spectacles.)

== Classification ==

=== Proper nouns and common nouns ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Czech language]] --&gt;

{{main article|Proper noun}}

A ''proper noun'' or ''proper name'' is a noun representing unique entities (such as ''[[India]]'', ''[[Pegasus]]'', ''[[Jupiter]]'', "[[Kaumarya saurav]]", ''[[Confucius]]'', or ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]''), as distinguished from common nouns which describe a class of entities (such as ''country'', ''animal'', ''planet'', ''person'' or ''ship'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lester|Beason|2005| page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''

=== Countable and uncountable nouns ===
{{Main article|Count noun|Mass noun}}

''Count nouns'' or ''countable nouns'' are common nouns that can take a [[plural]], can combine with [[numeral system|numerals]] or counting [[Quantifiers (linguistics)|quantifiers]] (e.g., ''one'', ''two'', ''several'', ''every'', ''most''), and can take an indefinite article such as ''a'' or ''an'' (in languages which have such articles). Examples of count nouns are ''chair'', ''nose'', and ''occasion''.

''Mass nouns'' or ''uncountable'' (or ''non-count'') ''nouns'' differ from count nouns in precisely that respect: they cannot take plurals or combine with number words or the above type of quantifiers.  For example, it is not possible to refer to ''a furniture'' or ''three furnitures''. This is true even though the pieces of furniture comprising ''furniture'' could be counted. Thus the distinction between mass and count nouns should not be made in terms of what sorts of things the nouns refer to, but rather in terms of how the nouns ''present'' these entities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Krifka|Krifka, Manfred]]. 1989. "Nominal Reference, Temporal Constitution and Quantification in Event Semantics". In R. Bartsch, J. van Benthem, P. von Emde Boas (eds.), Semantics and Contextual Expression, Dordrecht: Foris Publication.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nouns have both countable and uncountable uses; for example, ''soda'' is countable in "give me three sodas", but uncountable in "he likes soda".

=== Collective nouns ===
{{Main article|Collective noun}}

''Collective nouns'' are nouns that – even when they are inflected for the [[Grammatical number|singular]] – refer to ''groups'' consisting of more than one individual or entity. Examples include ''committee'', ''government'', and ''police''. In English these nouns may be followed by a singular or a plural verb and referred to by a singular or plural pronoun,  the singular being generally preferred when referring to the body as a unit and the plural often being preferred, especially in British English, when emphasizing the individual members.&lt;ref name="Gowers 2014"&gt;{{harvnb|Gowers|2014|pages=189–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of acceptable and unacceptable use given by Gowers in ''Plain Words'' include:&lt;ref name="Gowers 2014"/&gt;
{{block indent|"A committee ''was'' appointed to consider this subject." (singular)}}
{{block indent|"The committee ''were'' unable to agree." (plural)}}
{{block indent|* "The committee were of one mind when I sat on them." (unacceptable use of plural)}}

=== Concrete nouns and abstract nouns ===
{{Further information|Physical body|Abstract object}}

''Concrete nouns'' refer to [[physical bodies|physical entities]] that can, in principle at least ''(i.e. different schools of philosophy and sciences may question the assumption, but, for the most part, people agree to the existence of something. E.g. a rock, a tree,  universe)'', be observed by at least one of the [[sense]]s (for instance, ''chair'', ''apple'', ''Janet'' or ''atom''). ''Abstract nouns'', on the other hand, refer to [[abstract object]]s; that is, ideas or concepts (such as ''justice'' or ''hatred''). While this distinction is sometimes exclusive, some nouns have multiple senses, including both concrete and abstract ones: consider, for example, the noun ''art'', which usually refers to a concept (e.g., ''Art is an important element of human culture.'') but which can refer to a specific artwork in certain contexts (e.g., ''I put my daughter's art up on the fridge.'')

Some abstract nouns developed etymologically by figurative extension from literal roots. These include ''drawback'', ''fraction'', ''holdout'' and ''uptake''. Similarly, some nouns have both abstract and concrete senses, with the latter having developed by figurative extension from the former. These include ''view'', ''filter'', ''structure'' and ''key''.

In English, many abstract nouns are formed by adding a suffix (''-ness'', ''-ity'', ''-ion'') to adjectives or verbs. Examples are ''happiness'' (from the adjective ''happy''), ''circulation'' (from the verb ''circulate'') and ''serenity'' (from the adjective ''serene'').

=== Alienable vs. inalienable nouns ===
Some languages refer to nouns differently, depending on how ownership is being given for the given noun. This can be broken into two categories: alienable and [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]]. An alienable noun is something that does not belong to a person indefinitely. Inalienable nouns, on the other hand, refer to something that is possessed definitely. Examples of alienable nouns would be a tree or a shirt or roads. Examples of inalienable nouns would be a father or shadow or hair.

==== Pingelapese ====
The [[Pingelapese language]] uses a distinction between nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22068434|title=Papers in Kosraean and Ponapeic|last=M.|first=Good, Elaine|date=1989-01-01|publisher=Dept. of Linguistics, Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University|isbn=0-8588-3390-5|oclc=22068434}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several classifier forms: The first is for objects which tend to be pretty large in size and not being a favorite possession (tree or shirt), and the second is for small, controllable, favorite objects like dogs, books or spears. A third form would be set aside for food objects like bananas, oranges or fish. Drinks like water or coconut liquor also have classifier forms. A fifth classifier would be designated for things that are to be chewed but not fully consumed. The only example of this was from the book ''Papers in Kosraean and Ponapeic'': the fruit, pandanus, is chewed for the sweet/bitter juice, but what remains after consuming the juice discarded. The 6th classifier forms are set aside for ways of transportation (bikes, canoes, and boats). The last two classifiers are designated for land and houses.

== Noun phrases ==
{{main article|Noun phrase}}

A noun phrase is a phrase based on a noun, pronoun, or other noun-like word (nominal) optionally accompanied by modifiers such as [[determiner]]s and [[adjective]]s. A noun phrase functions within a clause or sentence in a role such as that of [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[object (grammar)|object]], or [[complement (grammar)|complement]] of a verb or preposition. For example, in the sentence "The black cat sat on a dear friend of mine", the noun phrase ''the black cat'' serves as the subject, and the noun phrase ''a dear friend of mine'' serves as the complement of the preposition ''on''.

== Pronouns ==
{{main article|Pronoun}}

Nouns and noun phrases can typically be replaced by [[pronoun]]s, such as ''he'', ''it'', ''which'', and ''those'', in order to avoid repetition or explicit identification, or for other reasons. For example, in the sentence ''Gareth thought that he was weird'', the word ''he'' is a pronoun standing in place of the person's name. The word ''one'' can replace parts of noun phrases, and it sometimes stands in for a noun.  An example is given below:

{{block indent|John's car is newer than ''the one'' that Bill has.}}

But ''one'' can also stand in for larger parts of a noun phrase. For example, in the following example, ''one'' can stand in for ''new car''.

{{block indent|This new car is cheaper than ''that one''.}}

== Nominalization ==
{{main article|Nominalization}}
Nominalization is a process whereby a word that belongs to another part of speech comes to be used as a noun.
In French and Spanish, for example, adjectives frequently act as nouns referring to people who have the characteristics denoted by the adjective. This sometimes happens in English as well, as in the following examples:

{{block indent|This legislation will have the most impact on the ''poor''.}}
{{block indent|The race is not to the ''swift'', nor the battle to the ''strong''.}}
{{block indent|The Socialist ''International'' is a worldwide association of political parties.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6615">'''Obadiah Rich''' (November 25, 1777 – January 20, 1850) was an American diplomat, [[bibliophile]] and [[bibliographer]] specializing the history of [[Latin America]].  He was credited with making the field of [[Americana]] a recognized field of scholarship by the bibliographer [[Nicholas Trübner]].&lt;ref name="B1"&gt;Basbanes 1999, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Obadiah Rich was born on [[Cape Cod]], at [[Truro, Massachusetts]], on November 25, 1777.  He was the  son of Captain Obadiah Rich (1758–1805) who commanded the brig ''Intrepid'' in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and his first wife Salome Lombard (1761–1807).&lt;ref&gt;Genealogy at Wellfleet and Beyond&lt;/ref&gt; He was the older brother of the [[botanist]] [[William Rich]].&lt;ref name="W"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/calbk:@field(DOCID+@lit(calbk177div0))|title=Glances at California 1847–1853 ... with a brief memoir and notes by Willard O. Waters|last=Hutton|first= William Rich|publisher=Library of Congress: American Memory|year=1942|accessdate=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obadiah Rich was elected to the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]] at the early age of 22, and helped found the [[Anthology Club|Anthology Society]] in 1804, which later became the [[Boston Athenæum]].  President [[James Madison]] appointed him American [[consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Valencia]], Spain, in 1816.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Basbanes 1999, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  He was consul in [[Madrid]] from 1823, and was working full-time in the book trade in London by 1830.&lt;ref name="B1" /&gt; He was again resident in [[Madrid]] and in [[Mahón]] on the island of [[Menorca]]  between 1834 and 1835.  He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistr American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Spain, Rich compiled an extensive collection of ancient Spanish and Latin American books and manuscripts, and was part of the circle of Latin America historians and scholars that included [[George Ticknor]], [[William H. Prescott]], and [[Washington Irving]], who researched his 1828 biography of [[Christopher Columbus]] while staying with Rich in Madrid.&lt;ref name="B1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="br"&gt;Brownrigg 1978, "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich wrote ''A Catalog of Books relating principally to America, arranged under the Years in which they were printed, 1500-1700'' (London, 1832);&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1832&lt;/ref&gt; ''Miscellaneous Catalog of Books in all Languages'' (1834), and ''Bibliotheca Americana Nova, or a Catalog of Books in Various Languages, relating to America, printed since the Year 1700'' (2 vols., London and New York, Volume I, 1835 and Volume II, 1846).&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1835&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1846&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in London in 1850.

==The collection==

Rich's books eventually were acquired by [[Edward G. Allen (bibliophile)|Edward G. Allen]] of London, and dispersed. A substantial portion were acquired by the American bibliophile [[James Lenox]] in 1848 who subsequently donated them to the [[New York Public Library]] in 1897. The Obadiah Rich Collection is now housed in the Library’s Manuscripts and Archives Division.&lt;ref name="br" /&gt;

This collection contains hundreds of original manuscripts and transcriptions of manuscripts covering the period from [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first voyage of 1492 to the last years of the colonial period.  The collection contains papers on [[New Spain]] ([[Mexico]]), [[Peru]] and the other Spanish colonies and [[Brazil]]. The collection is documented in the catalog ''Colonial Latin American Manuscripts and Transcripts in the Obadiah Rich Collection''. Among his notable pieces is the only known copy of the first printing of Columbus's  announcement of his discovery ([[Barcelona]], 1493) and "The Brief and Most Concise Christian Doctrine in the Mexican Language" of [[Juan de Zumárraga]], first bishop of Mexico. This volume is considered to be the first book printed in the Americas.  It was printed in an imported press in the [[House of the First Print Shop in the Americas|Casa de las Campanas]] in [[Mexico City]] in 1543, nearly one hundred years before the first book was printed in the English colonies.

'''''Paolo and Francesca da Rimini''''' is a [[watercolour]] by English artist and poet [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], painted in 1855 and currently housed at [[Tate Britain]].

==History==
Rossetti's real name was Charles Gabriel Dante Rossetti, but his admiration for the great Florentine poet led him to change it to Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and he proceeded to sign all his work so. In the specific, the very subject of this painting is taken from [[Dante Aligheri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', [[Inferno (Dante)#Second Circle .28Lust.29|Canto V]] – it is a small watercolour [[triptych]] executed in the archaic, [[medieval]]ising style of this period in Rossetti's art, and was never painted in oil. Although the artist had been sketching the subject for many years, the watercolour took him just one week to complete. The buyer was the writer and critic [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref&gt;The subject was commissioned by Ellen Heaton, but [[John Ruskin]], who had requested five watercolours from Rossetti, bought it for 35 guineas and offered it, along with another picture, to Miss Heaton. He described the picture to her in a letter as 'a most gloomy drawing – very grand – but dreadful – of Dante seeing the soul of Francesca and her lover!' Not surprisingly, Heaton was dissuaded from buying the picture, which Ruskin kept for himself. Cf. V. Surtees, ''The Paintings &amp; Drawings of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882): A Catalogue Raisonné'', vol.1, Oxford 1971, p.37. See also the Tate's ref.[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=12779&amp;tabview=text&amp;texttype=10]&lt;/ref&gt; The drawing is simple and the colours generally muted. Only Francesca's long golden hair looks forward to the more sensuous creatures of Rossetti's later works. The picture was originally planned as a triptych in oil, with the same scenes as in the watercolour, but with the lovers kissing as the central motif.

===The Triptych and the inspiring ''Canto''===
[[Francesca da Rimini|Francesca]] was the sister-in-law of [[Paolo Malatesta]], and both were married, but they fell in love. Their tragic adulterous story was told by Dante in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Canto V of the ''Inferno'', and was a popular subject with [[Victorian era|Victorian]] artists and sculptors, especially with followers of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] ideology, and with other writers.

The triptych has several inscriptions taken from Canto V, with Rossetti bringing the story to life by writing relevant quotations in the original Italian around the edge of the composition.&lt;ref&gt;The top of central panel has the inscription ''O lasso!'' ("Alas!"). At bottom left, another continues the same verse, ''quanti dolci pensier, quanto disio...'' ("how many sweet thoughts, how great desire"), Inferno, Canto V, vv.112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Its three parts read from left to right. The left-hand panel shows the adulterous kiss that condemns the lovers: staying faithful to Dante's poem, Rossetti depicts them reading about the [[Arthurian legend|Arthurian]] knight [[Sir Lancelot]] who also suffered for his forbidden love (his figure can be seen on the book's open page, dressed, like Paolo, in red and blue). The scene illustrates the following lines from Dante's text:
{{quote|One day we read, to pass the time away,
of Lancelot, of how he fell in love;
alone we were, and no suspicion near us 
... then he, who never from me shall separate,
at once my lips all trembling kissed.|''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Canto V, vv.127–136 (free transl.)}}

The central panel depicts two of Rossetti's literary heroes crowned with laurel: the Roman poet [[Virgil]] and the much-revered Dante himself – they regard with concern the two lovers on the right, who appear to float like wraiths in each other's arms, amid the flames of hell. Their adulterous relationship uncovered, they were murdered by Francesca's husband and Paolo's brother, [[Sigismondo Malatesta]], and banished to the second circle of hell.

In the final panel of the triptych, the lovers are being blown about violently with the wind, as described by Dante's verses: {{quote|The infernal storm, eternal in its rage, sweeps and drives the spirits with its blast.|''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Canto V, vv.31–32}}

In [[political science]] and [[political history]], the term '''power vacuum,''' also known as a power void, is an analogy between a physical [[vacuum]], to the [[politics|political]] condition "when someone has lost control of something and no one has replaced them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/power-vacuum|title=power vacuum Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation can occur when a [[government]] has no identifiable central [[Power (social and political)|power]] or [[authority]]. The physical analogy suggests that in a power vacuum, other forces will tend to "rush in" to fill the vacuum as soon as it is created, perhaps in the form of an armed [[militia]] or [[insurgency|insurgents]], [[military]] [[Coup d'état|coup]], [[warlord]] or [[dictator]]. The term is also often used in [[organized crime]] when a [[crime family]] becomes vulnerable to competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9037101-mob-murder-and-the-hamilton-connection/|title=Mob, murder and the Hamilton connection|date=16 November 2018|publisher=thespec.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hereditary or statutory [[order of succession]] or effective [[succession planning]] are orderly ways to resolve questions of succession to positions of power. When such methods are unavailable, such as in failed [[dictatorship]]s or [[civil war]]s, a power vacuum arises, which prompts a '''power struggle''' entailing [[politics|political]] competition, [[violence]], or (usually) both. A power vacuum can also occur after a [[constitutional crisis]] in which large portions of the government resign or are removed, creating unclear succession.

== Historical examples ==

Historic examples include the [[death of Alexander the Great]], the 11th century power vacuum in the middle east which allowed the [[Seljuks]] to take over, the defeat of France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]], and the decrease in power of Great Britain and France in the Middle East after the [[Suez Crisis]].

During the course of the [[Ming treasure voyages]] (1405-1433), the Chinese [[Ming dynasty|Ming empire]] was the dominant political and military force within the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=fin92/&gt; However, in 1433, the Chinese government withdrew their [[Chinese treasure fleet|treasure fleet]] and thus left a large void within the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=fin92&gt;{{cite journal | last=Finlay | first=Robert | title=Portuguese and Chinese Maritime Imperialism: Camoes's Lusiads and Luo Maodeng's Voyage of the San Bao Eunuch|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=1992 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=225–241 | jstor=178944 | ref=harv | doi=10.1017/S0010417500017667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary examples ==

When in 2003 the [[United States]] led [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|a coalition]] to oust [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Iraq War]], the absence of an all-out Iraqi opposition force at war with government forces meant that once the [[Ba'ath Party]] was removed, no local figures were on hand to immediately assume the now-vacant administerial posts. For this reason, [[Paul Bremer]] was appointed by the United States government as the interim head of state to oversee the transition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/CPA_ORHA/Doc_128_CPA_Legal_Instruments.pdf Memo to Bremer from Office of General Counsel, CPA dated 22 May 2003, Retrieved February 28, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113023438/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/CPA_ORHA/Doc_128_CPA_Legal_Instruments.pdf |date=13 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other western-led interventions such as in [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Kosovo]] (1999) and [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libya]] (2011) where the initial claim of justification in each case was a humanitarian matter, there had been active opposition fighting on the ground to oust the relevant governments (in the case of Kosovo, this meant removal of state forces from the desired territory rather than ousting the government itself). Subsequently, successor entities were immediately effective in Libya and Kosovo.

One observer has stated that, "different forms of female suffering are minimized, mocked, coaxed into silence."&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt;

Clinicians are not as likely to assess women for substance abuse as often as they assess men. They also tend to miss signs of substance addiction in women. Women are not as likely as men to be assessed for alcohol abuse. Out of those women who are found to have an alcohol problem, they were found to be less likely to be referred for treatment. Those women in the childbearing years are prescribed more prescription medications than men. It is generally more common for women to be prescribed [[antipsychotic]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and opioids.&lt;ref name="Terplan2017"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Terplan M|date=August 2017|title=Women and the opioid crisis: historical context and public health solutions|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=108|issue=2|pages=195–199|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2017.06.007|pmid=28697909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Women report feeling like they were 'silly' by male physicians but female physicians were more sensitive and preferred.&lt;ref name =huff2017/&gt; In a study of multiple men, women, and married couples, it was observed that men’s complaints about physical health were evaluated more in depth than women’s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Armitage, K.

[[Sex-selective abortion]] is the medical procedure or treatment that terminates a pregnancy when the baby is an undesired gender.

Sex selective abortion has been heavily utilized in numerous Asian countries. A British medical journal stated: "Compared with the normal ratio of about 95 girls being born per 100 boys (which is what we observe in Europe and North America), Singapore and Taiwan have 92, South Korea 88, and China a mere 86 girls born per 100 boys."&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Amartya. “Missing Women—revisited: Reduction in Female Mortality Has Been Counterbalanced by Sex Selective Abortions.” ''BMJ : British Medical Journal'' 327, no. 7427 (December 6, 2003): 1297. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.327.7427.1297&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical trials and research==
Most clinical trials published before 1988 included no women and so many older medications on the market were never evaluated for their effects and side effects on women.&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mazure&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mazure CM, Jones DP | title = Twenty years and still counting: including women as participants and studying sex and gender in biomedical research | journal = BMC Women's Health | volume = 15 | pages = 94 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26503700 | pmc = 4624369 | doi = 10.1186/s12905-015-0251-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiology of male sex differentiation is described as "well studied, whereas the pathways that regulate female sexual differentiation remain incompletely defined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biason-Lauber A, De Filippo G, Konrad D, Scarano G, Nazzaro A, Schoenle EJ | title = WNT4 deficiency--a clinical phenotype distinct from the classic Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome: a case report | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 224–9 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 16959810 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/del360 | url = https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/22/1/224/2939474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s "women's health' was mostly considered only as [[reproductive health]], and women who were capable of bearing children were excluded from clinical trials to avoid any risk to a potential fetus.&lt;ref name=NAP1994/&gt;  Additionally, the [[thalidomide]] tragedy led the FDA to issue regulations in 1977 recommending that women should be excluded from participating in Phase I and Phase II studies in the US.&lt;ref name=Liu2016/&gt; The approach to women shifted from [[paternalism|paternalistic]] protection to access in the early 1980s as AIDS activists like [[ACT UP]] and women's groups challenged ways that drugs were [[drug development|developed]].  The NIH responded with policy changes in 1986, but a Government Accountability Office report in 1990 found that women were still being excluded from clinical research. That report, the appointment of [[Bernadine Healy]] as the first woman to lead the NIH, and the realization that important clinical trials had excluded women led to the creation of the [[Women's Health Initiative]] at the NIH and to the federal legislation, the 1993 National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act, which mandated that women and minorities be included in NIH-funded research.&lt;ref name=NAP1994&gt;{{cite book|last1=Institute of Medicine|editor1-last=Mastroianni|editor1-first=Anna C.|editor2-last=Faden|editor2-first=Ruth|editor3-last=Federman|editor3-first=Daniel | name-list-format = vanc |title=Women and Health Research: Ethical and Legal Issues of Including Women in Clinical Studies, Volume 1|date=1994|publisher=The National Academy Press|isbn=0-309-04992-X|pages=2–3|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/2304/chapter/2|language=en|chapter=Executive Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;{{cite book|last1=U.S. Government Accountability Office|title=National Institutes of Health: Problems in Implementing Policy on Women in Study Populations|date=1990|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO/T-HRD-90-50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2003/&gt;  The initial large studies on the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the 1970s and 1980s are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men, but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women.&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2003&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiebinger L | title = Women's health and clinical trials | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 112 | issue = 7 | pages = 973–7 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14523031 | pmc = 198535 | doi = 10.1172/JCI19993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Regular aspirin intake and acute myocardial infarction | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 5905 | pages = 440–3 | date = March 1974 | pmid = 4816857 | pmc = 1633212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elwood PC, Cochrane AL, Burr ML, Sweetnam PM, Williams G, Welsby E, Hughes SJ, Renton R | title = A randomized controlled trial of acetyl salicylic acid in the secondary prevention of mortality from myocardial infarction | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 5905 | pages = 436–40 | date = March 1974 | pmid = 4593555 | pmc = 1633246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 the FDA reversed its 1977 guidance, and included in the new guidance a statement that the former restriction was “rigid and paternalistic, leaving virtually no room for the exercise of judgment by responsible research subjects, physician investigators, and investigational review boards (IRBs)”.&lt;ref name=Liu2016/&gt;

The [[National Academy of Medicine]] published a report called "Women and Health Research: Ethical and Legal Issues of Including Women in Clinical Studies" in 1994&lt;ref name=NAP1994/&gt; and another report in 2001 called "Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health: Does Sex Matter?” which each urged including women in clinical trials and running analyses on subpopulations by sex.&lt;ref name=Liu2016&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu KA, Mager NA | title = Women's involvement in clinical trials: historical perspective and future implications | journal = Pharmacy Practice | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 708 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27011778 | pmc = 4800017 | doi = 10.18549/PharmPract.2016.01.708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Institute of Medicine|title=Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health: Does Sex Matter?|date=2001|publisher=National Academy Press|isbn=9780309072816|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/10028/exploring-the-biological-contributions-to-human-health-does-sex-matter|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 review by the [[International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] found that regulation in the US, Europe, and Japan required that clinical trials should reflect the population to whom an intervention will be given, and found that clinical trials that had been submitted to agencies were generally complying with those regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ICH|title=Gender Considerations in the Conduct of Clinical Trials (EMEA/CHMP/3916/2005)|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2010/01/WC500059887.pdf|publisher=EMA|date=5 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of NIH-funded studies (not necessarily submitted to regulatory agencies) published between 1995 and 2010 found that they had an "average enrollment of 37% (±6% standard deviation [SD]) women, at an increasing rate over the years. Only 28% of the publications either made some reference to sex/gender-specific results in the text or provided detailed results including sex/gender-specific estimates of effect or tests of interaction."&lt;ref name=Foulkes&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foulkes MA | title = After inclusion, information and inference: reporting on clinical trials results after 15 years of monitoring inclusion of women | journal = Journal of Women's Health | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 829–36 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21671773 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.2010.2527 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA published a study of the 30 sets of clinical trial data submitted after 2011, and found that for all of them, information by sex was available in public documents, and that almost all of them included subanalyses by sex.&lt;ref name=Liu2016/&gt;

In addition to falling victim to sexual assault in the workplace, female surgeons have also been found to fall victim to the wage gap.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Females were reported to have lower salaries than male surgeons.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In a study conducted in 1990, male clinicians were making a mean earnings of $155,400, while female clinicians were making a mean earnings of $109,900; about $45,500 less than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Laurence C.|date=1996-04-11|title=Differences in Earnings between Male and Female Physicians|url=https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199604113341506|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=334|issue=15|pages=960–964|doi=10.1056/NEJM199604113341506|issn=0028-4793|pmid=8596598}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, female physicians have statistically been found to make about $18,677 less than male physicians.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desai|first=Tejas|last2=Ali|first2=Sadeem|last3=Fang|first3=Xiangming|last4=Thompson|first4=Wanda|last5=Jawa|first5=Pankaj|last6=Vachharajani|first6=Tushar|date=2016-06-27|title=Equal work for unequal pay: the gender reimbursement gap for healthcare providers in the United States|url=http://pmj.bmj.com/content/early/2016/06/27/postgradmedj-2016-134094|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|language=en|pages=postgradmedj–2016–134094|doi=10.1136/postgradmedj-2016-134094|issn=0032-5473|pmid=27528703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparities between male and female surgeons has also been blamed upon not being as qualified as men to commit to leadership roles that earn them higher salaries.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Yet women are just as willing as men to accept positions of leadership when they are equally qualified. In many cases, women clinicians are equal to men at leadership tasks.&lt;ref name="zhuge"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhuge Y, Kaufman J, Simeone DM, Chen H, Velazquez OC | title = Is there still a glass ceiling for women in academic surgery? | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 253 | issue = 4 | pages = 637–43 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21475000 | doi = 10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182111120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other clinicians have expressed that they believe women in medicine are less committed to their careers and women are less effective as leaders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Moreover, female clinicians have also experienced barriers within finding the support to balance both working and having or maintaining a family. It has been reported that females are more likely to return back to work after having a child part-time as opposed to full-time because they lack the support they receive by both their employers and society as a whole. It was found that the percentage of female clinicians working part-time in either a hospital setting or a general physician’s office after having a child is much higher than the percentage of these women working full time after having a child (92.7%, 96.3% 59.2%, 76.5% respectively). &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=V|date=2001|title=Career Obstacles for Women in Medicine: An

Unfortunately, women are less likely to return back full time if having worked in the hospital because those shifts require longer hours and a lot of help that they may not be receiving.

Furthermore, female physician narratives have described instances of sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Koven S|date=May 2017|title=Letter to a Young Female Physician|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=376|issue=20|pages=1907–1909|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1702010|pmid=28514609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female physicians are often mistaken for nurses by patients.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Patients have also been reported to have less trust in their physician if they are female and instead ask for a second opinion from a male physician.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women physicians, on the other hand, have also been found to partake in sexist actions.

==Male clinicians==

Men often decide to become nurses for self-actualization or survival needs, or simply because their original plans did not work out. However, there are a handful of men who decide to become nurses and start their studies with that goal in mind. Unfortunately, when men enter the field of nursing, they encounter many barriers that limit their choice of specialty. They run the risk of being labeled and stereotyped. These gender biases and role stereotyping occur because of the fact that nursing facilities are often composed mainly of women. Nursing tends to be identified with feminine style of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kouta|first=Christina|date=2011|title=Gender Discrimination and Nursing|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S8755722310001468/1-s2.0-S8755722310001468-main.pdf?_tid=841c9e65-25d6-47d1-bddf-c29cea94ce0e&amp;acdnat=1523315142_2628a13261b5f42cbfe83c9cfb9c3311|journal=Journal of Professional Nursing|volume=27|pages=59-63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males only make up 9% of nurses. Stereotyping of men is related to nursing being considered a profession for women.&lt;ref name="kron"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kronsberg|first1=Suzanne|last2=Bouret|first2=Josephine Rachel|last3=Brett|first3=Anne Liners | name-list-format = vanc |title=Lived experiences of male nurses: Dire consequences for the nursing profession|journal=Journal of Nursing Education and Practice|volume=8|issue=1|year=2017|pages=46|issn=1925-4059|doi=10.5430/jnep.v8n1p46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men tend to face two common stereotypes when it comes to being nurses. The first being the stereotype that male nurses are gay since they are in a “feminine occupation.” The other common stereotype is that men are generally hypersexual and that this will inhibit them from being able to provide intimate care to women in nonsexual ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Heteronormative Labour|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=32c8867a-e474-43e9-9c84-1f36707061ec%40sessionmgr104|journal=Gender, Work, and Organization|volume=23|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues regarding sexism in/against male clinicians are harder to describe except possibly by example. Male nurses report:

* being mistaken for a doctor
* being asked to see the 'pretty' nurse
* being called 'Doc' even when the patient knew the man was a nurse
* being discounted as 'only' a nurse rather than a doctor by other professionals
* being asked: "when are you going to become a doctor?"
* being told that a female nurse is preferred&lt;ref name = nurse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minoritynurse.com/male-nurses-confronting-stereotypes-and-discrimination-part-1-the-issues/|title=Male Nurses Confronting Stereotypes and Discrimination: Part 1, The Issues - Minority Nurse|website=minoritynurse.com|access-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*being bullied on the job
*being teased as a child for wanting to be a nurse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2017/mar/01/why-so-few-male-nurses|title=Why are there so few male nurses?|first=Rachel|last=Williams | name-list-format = vanc |date=1 March 2017|publisher=|access-date=4 September 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other questions are often asked of male nurses such as 'why did you go into nursing'? Or they are asked if they are [[gay]] failed medical school and became a nurse because it was easier. Sometimes a male nurse can be asked if he is nurse so that he can see undressed women.&lt;ref name = nurse/&gt; In some instances male nurses were assumed to be the 'muscle' for other female nurses. Nursing supervisors tended to ask patients if it was alright to assign a male nurse to provide care. Male nurses have reported bias directed toward them during their studies. They experienced anxiety, insomnia, anger, and trepidation in anticipation of being treated poorly.&lt;ref name=kron/&gt;

Another difficulty that male nurses face is that they are passed over for work with female patients, or they are not allowed on birthing or gynecological units. This is concerning due to the fact that male doctors are completely welcome in these situations. In addition, male nurses find that they are pushed toward tasks that are stereotypically consistent with their gender role. Some of these might include heavy lifting, administrative roles, or psychiatric nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clow|first=Kimberley|date=September 2014|title=Are You Man Enough to be a Nurse?|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=16&amp;sid=32c8867a-e474-43e9-9c84-1f36707061ec%40sessionmgr104|journal=Springer|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Medical education==
Women are underrepresented in leadership positions in academic medicine. Women and men begin their medical careers at similar rates but they do not advance at the same rate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Studies indicate a systematic bias that has resulted in relatively fewer appointments to academic chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grant-Kels JM | title = Sexism in medicine, circa 2016-2017 | journal = International Journal of Women's Dermatology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 68–69 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28492058 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijwd.2017.01.007 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352647517300072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huff2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.healthline.com/health-news/sexism-is-alive-in-healthcare|title=Sexism Is Alive, Well in the Healthcare Industry|last1=Haskins|first1=Julia|date=March 25, 2016|work=Healthline|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armato|first1=Michael|date=July 2013|title=Wolves in Sheep's Clothing: Men's Enlightened Sexism &amp; Hegemonic Masculinity in Academia|journal=Women's Studies|volume=42|issue=5|pages=578–598|doi=10.1080/00497878.2013.794055}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savigny|first1=Heather|date=24 October 2014|title=Women, know your limits: cultural sexism in academia|journal=Gender and Education|volume=26|issue=7|pages=794–809|doi=10.1080/09540253.2014.970977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-two percent of associate professors at medical schools are women, 32% of associate professors are women, 20% of full professors are women, 14% of department chairs are women, and 11% of deans of medical schools are women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carnes M, Bartels CM, Kaatz A, Kolehmainen C | title = Why is John More Likely to Become Department Chair Than Jennifer? | journal = Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association | volume = 126 | pages = 197–214 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26330674 | pmc = 4530686 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A factor that impedes women’s opportunities for advancement in academic medicine is a “stereotype-based cognitive bias.” There are two forms of this. The first type is related to clear personal beliefs about women, such as believing that women are less committed to their careers than men and believing that women are worse leaders than men. The second type is implicit bias, which is harder to see because the biases are harder to see, but they still influence one’s judgment and actions towards women. Although implicit gender bias still plays a role, explicit bias in academic medicine has significantly decreased during the past half century in the United States as a result of Title IX getting passed. Implicit bias has had little to no improvement. Cultural stereotypes characterize women as “communal,” such as kind, dependent, and nurturing, but characterize women as lacking “agentric” traits, such as logical, independent, and strong, which are typically used as a male stereotype. These stereotypes make it difficult for women to achieve in the workforce, specifically in medicine, science, and in leadership. While men are associated with “agentic” traits and women are not, this can lead to women feeling that their work is less valued and they typically receive fewer nominations for opportunities that can advance their career. It has also been found that gender stereotypes play a role in socializing students towards their specialties. For example, women are more likely to go into communal specialties, including family medicine, pediatrics, and internal medicine, while men are more likely to go into surgery, research, and be the chair of a position. If women to go into specialties dominated by males, they typically have lower statuses. Residency is the first time the medical students, or new physicians, get to be in a leadership role. Men who are too communal can be accused of being “wimpy” or “soft” whereas women who are too agentic can be accused of being “bossy” or “domineering.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carnes M, Bartels CM, Kaatz A, Kolehmainen C | title = Why is John More Likely to Become Department Chair Than Jennifer? | journal = Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association | volume = 126 | pages = 197–214 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26330674 | pmc = 4530686 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These stereotypes are due to the lack of gender awareness and role models. Female medical students have reported sexual harassment and discrimination. This is of concern because these obstacles affect "the professional identity formation and specialty choice." Personality differences exist between male and female surgical students. Fewer women choose to specialize in surgery. The lack of female role models may discourage some from choosing a surgical career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burgos CM, Josephson A | title = Gender differences in the learning and teaching of surgery: a literature review | journal = International Journal of Medical Education | volume = 5 | pages = 110–24 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 25341220 | doi = 10.5116/ijme.5380.ca6b | url = https://www.ijme.net/archive/5/gender-differences-in-learning-and-teaching-of-surgery/?ref=linkout }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the National Medical Foundation found that 60% of women have reported that gender has had an effect on their educational experience whereas only 25% of males have reported that gender has had an effect on their educational experience. Women said they felt as though they had to be twice as good to be treated equal to men. Additionally, 30.7% of women reported overcoming fear and failure whereas only 19.4% of males reported overcoming fear and failure in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bright CM, Duefield CA, Stone VE | title = Perceived barriers and biases in the medical education experience by gender and race | journal = Journal of the National Medical Association | volume = 90 | issue = 11 | pages = 681–8 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9828583 | pmc = 2608378 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One response to bias against women academics has been to conduct training for faculty and students to recognize bias and change their habits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Wage gap==
Communal specialties, which women are more likely to go into, often have a lower pay than the specialties in which men typically go into. Women have been found to have a larger representation than men in lower-paying specialties, such as pediatrics and men lave a larger representation in higher-paying specialties, such as cardiology and surgery. In New York State between 1999 and 2008, the average starting salary for men was $187,385 whereas the mean starting salary for women was $158,727.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lo Sasso AT, Richards MR, Chou CF, Gerber SE | title = The $16,819 pay gap for newly trained physicians: the unexplained trend of men earning more than women | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–201 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21289339 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0597 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, it was found that male physicians earned roughly around 41% more than their female colleagues.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As of 2017, an updated version then found that the percentage had dropped to roughly around 27.7%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/14/news/economy/gender-pay-gap-doctors/index.html|title=The gender pay gap for women doctors is big -- and getting worse|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That is roughly around a 100,000 dollar difference in salary per year. However, interestingly enough, women who work in radiology are the only women who make more than their male colleagues and the difference is only about 2,000 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wimlf.org/news/post/37|title=THE WAGE GAP IN MEDICINE: WHAT WE KNOW|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 2005 found that women physicians in the US had an annual earning gap of 11% if they were married, 14% if they had one child, and 22% if they had more than one child. Women typically had household obligations that affected their ability to work as much as men and therefore led to a trade-off of higher earnings for family-friendly jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sasser|first=Alicia C. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2005|title=Gender Differences in Physician Pay: Tradeoffs between Career and Family|jstor=4129534|journal=The Journal of Human Resources|volume=40|issue=2|pages=477–504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the Salem Witch Trials in the late 1600s, women were disproportionately accused of witchcraft due to induced seizures induced by mold. Despite ergotism affecting both male and female populations, young females were more likely to be tried and killed for witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Alan. 2000. “Witchcraft or Mycotoxin? The Salem Witch Trials.” ''Journal of Toxicology:'' 

''Clinical Toxicology'' 38 (4): 457–60. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1081/CLT-100100958&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1800s, physicians (predominately male) described physical ailments of women as '[[hysteria]]'. In 1948 some women volunteered to take part in an [[experiment]] designed to quantify pain in [[childbirth|laboring women]]. During their labor, their hands were burned.&lt;ref name="verilymag.com" /&gt;

In a 1979 observational study, 104 women and men gave responses to their health in 5 areas: “back pain, headaches, dizziness, chest pain, and fatigue. When receiving these complaints, it was seen that doctors gave extensive checkups to men more often than women with similar complaints, supporting that female patients tend to be taken less seriously than their male counterparts with regard to receiving medical illnesses. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1990, the [[National Institutes of Health]] recognized the disparities in research of disease in men and when. At this time the Office of Research on Women’s Health was created. A large part of its purpose is to raise awareness of sex affects disease and treatments.&lt;ref name = "verilymag.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name = huff2017/&gt; In 1991 and 1992 recognition that a 'glass ceiling' existed which prevented from female clinicians from being promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Madsen MK, Blide LA | title = Professional advancement of women in health care management: a conceptual model | journal = Topics in Health Information Management | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 45–55 | date = November 1992 | pmid = 10122424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiggins C | title = Female healthcare managers and the glass ceiling. The obstacles and opportunities for women in management | journal = Hospital Topics | volume = 69 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–14 | date = 3 September 1991 | pmid = 10109490 | doi = 10.1080/00185868.1991.9948448 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the FDA created an Office of Women’s Health by congressional mandate.&lt;ref name="Liu2016" /&gt;

==Gender Roles==

According to a study done in 2003, it can be seen that the numbers of women in medicine have increased significantly. This trend continues into today. In the United States, there has actually been a “progressive decrease in male applicants to medicine and a substantial rise in female applicants.” Gender difference have been found in the motivations for applying to medical school. Studies suggest that “male applicants are more motivated by financial, prestige, scientific and technical issues, whereas female applicants stress more ‘person orientated’ humanistic and altruistic reasons.” Gender differences have also been found in “attitudes toward health promotion.” In addition, male and female clinicians are likely to use different styles of communication. Male doctors were found to be more likely to “speak in an authoritative manner, give direct commands to patients, interrupt more, are perceived as more imposing and presumptuous, spend less time with patients, make fewer positive statements and smile and nod less.” Some studies have found that female doctors “provide more intensive therapeutic milieu that could lead to more open exchange and comprehensive diagnosis and treatment.” In addition, females have been found to take more precautionary measures and give more tests than men are&lt;ref&gt;Kilminster, Sue, et al. “Women in Medicine. Is There a Problem? A Literature Review of the Changing Gender Composition, Structures and Occupational Cultures in Medicine.” Medical Education, vol. 41, no. 1, 2007, pp. 39-49., doi:10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02645.x.
 &lt;/ref&gt;. 

There is also a connection between gender roles in the medical field and family pressures. A study was done to determine how doctors combine their working lives with having a normal family life. This study analyzes three different strategies used by men and women in order to cope with managing a normal family life and a work-heavy career. The three different types of strategies that men and women use are “career dominant, segregated, and accommodated.” When it comes to the career dominant strategy, about 15% of women and 3% of men adopt this strategy. This strategy “implies a continuous, full time career and a reduced family life- living single or divorced and childless as a consequence of the career.” The segregated strategy is composed of 55% of women and 85% of men, and it “implies a continuous, full time career with family roles organized so as to enable more time to be devoted to the career.” And lastly, the accommodating strategy is adopted by 30% of women and 12% of men. This strategy “implies that work involvement has been reduced in some way to allow more time for family roles.” As can be seen by these statistics, men are more likely than women to devote more time to their job as opposed to their family.&lt;ref&gt;Theorell, T. “Changing Society: Changing Role of Doctors.” Bmj, vol. 320, no. 7247, 2000, pp. 1417-1418., doi: 10.1136/bmj.320.7247.1417.

'''''The Conservative Case for Trump''''' is a 2016 book by [[Phyllis Schlafly]], a [[movement conservative]] best known for helping to defeat the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Thorner"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Thorner | first1=Nancy | title=Thorner: 'The Conservative Case for Trump' Takes on Special Meaning with Schlafly's Death | url=http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2016/09/thorner-the-conservative-case-for-trump-takes-on-special-meaning-with-schlaflys-death.html | date=September 7, 2016 | publisher=''Illinois Review'' | accessdate=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was her final book, being published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regnery.com/books/the-conservative-case-for-trump/|website=Regency Publishing|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in September 2016, following the nomination of [[Donald Trump]] for [[President of the United States]], and explains in detail Schlafly's rationale for viewing Trump a serious conservative and a better candidate than [[Hillary Clinton]].

The book, co-written by [[Ed Martin (Missouri politician)|Ed Martin]] and [[Brett M. Decker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/politics/phyllis-schlafly-donald-trump-book/index.html|title=When Phyllis Schlafly made the case for Donald Trump|first=Eugene|last=Scott|work=cnn.com|date=September 7, 2016|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   describes Trump's anti-establishment stances on the following issues:

* [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic regulations]]
* [[education]]
* [[family values]]
* [[illegal immigration]]
* [[judicial activism]]
* [[political correctness]]
* [[social security]]
* the [[U.S. military]]
* [[trade]]

One argument the book makes is that Republicans who do not support Trump would wind up helping to elect Hillary Clinton instead of him.&lt;ref name="Amazon reviewers"&gt;"This book by Phyllis Schlafly, Ed Martin, and Brett Decker shows why Republicans not supporting Trump are helping elect Hillary Clinton." —[[Laura Ingraham]]&lt;/ref&gt; It also argues that Republicans and independents ought to "unify behind his candidacy".&lt;ref follow="Amazon reviewers"&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In The Conservative Case for Trump, Phyllis Schlafly, Ed Martin, and Brett M. Decker show how President Trump can get our country back on the right track, and why Republicans and independents need to unify behind his candidacy."—Newt Gingrich&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[William F. Buckley Jr.#Buckley Rule|Buckley Rule]].)

The book's publication followed Schlafly's tussle with the board of the [[Eagle Forum]] after she unilaterally endorsed Trump's presidency.&lt;ref name="Thorner" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2965">'''The Politics of Social Change in the Middle East and North Africa''' is a 1963 book by [[Manfred Halpern]].  For years it was "the only academic treatment of [[Islamism]]," and served as "the basic text" on the politics of the Arab world for a generation of students.&lt;ref name=KramerWar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Martin|title=The War on Error|date=2016|publisher=Trnasaction Publishers|page=72|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Politics of Social change'' was written at the behest of the [[RAND Corporation]] and published by [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;ref name=MacDonaldHistory&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=David Bruce|title=Thinking History, Fighting Evil|date=2009|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0739125036|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was widely reviewed and went through 6 printings.&lt;ref name=KramerWar/&gt;

==Neo-Islamic Totalitarianism== 

Halpern describes the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and similar [[Islamist]] movements as a new kind of "Neo-Islamic Totalitarianism" best understood as a uniquely Islamic form of [[fascism]].  He argued that it is distinctive in drawing on a deeply Islamic apocalyptic tradition whereby at times of crises "an apocalyptic vision of spiritual and political redemption" comes to the fore.  That modernity and urbanization deprived enormous numbers of people of livelihoods, and attracting many to faith and to an ideological rejection of material goods, while the literacy produced by urban life and modernity enable them to access religious texts. And that Islamic fascism drew these seekers to charismatic leaders who offered "an intoxicating sense of nihilism" in an atmosphere in which leaders made [[martyrdom]] into a spiritual goal and followers were "sent to death as robots" with the "illusion of dying as martyrs".
&lt;ref name=MacDonaldHistory/&gt;

He described the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] as aiming to unify all Muslims under a new caliphate.&lt;ref name=MacDonaldHistory/&gt;

==Criticism==

Frédéric Volpi argues that Halpern's work represents a mix of mid-[[Cold War]]  and [[orientalism]].   &lt;ref name=Volpe&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8357">'''The Triangle Network '''(formally known as the''' '''Triangle Arts Trust) is an international arts organization that brings together artists from different countries to explore new ideas and expand the boundaries of their practice. Triangle was initiated through a series of artists' workshops providing an uninterrupted period of two weeks where 20–25 artists from diverse [[culture|cultural]] backgrounds engage with each other, to explore new ideas and expand the boundaries of their practice. Now the Triangle Network coalesces grassroots arts organisations around the world (many of which were initiated as workshops while others grew independently), in order that artists' mobility, international cultural exchange and capacity building objectives can be shared.

The Triangle Network is registered as a charitable organization in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/ScannedAccounts/Ends11%5C0000326411_AC_20040331_E_C.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Triangle Network was established in 1982 by [[Robert Loder]] and [[Anthony Caro]], and is organised as a network of [[artist]]s, [[visual art]] organisations, and artists-led workshops. It currently is active in over 30 countries. Each centre within the Network is independent and set up to respond to local needs. The object of the workshops is "to counterbalance the tendency of the Western art world to put the emphasis on the object and its marketing rather than on the creative process itself".
