'''''A Nature Conservation Review''''' is a 2-volume work by [[Derek Ratcliffe]], published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 1977. It set out to identify the most important places for nature conservation in Great Britain. It is often known by the acronym NCR, and sites listed in it are termed "NCR sites".

The approach adopted by Ratcliffe was adapted and applied to the selection of sites important for geological conservation in the [[Geological Conservation Review]]. A [[Marine Nature Conservation Review]] has also been published.

Volume 1 set out the rationale and methods used, and gave descriptions of the major habitat types.

Volume 2 consisted entirely of a site inventory. Sites were grouped into six major habitat types:
* Coastal sites - 135 sites
* Woodlands - 234 sites
* Lowland grasslands, heaths and scrub - 159 sites
* Open waters - 99 sites
* Peatlands - 116 sites
* Upland grasslands and heaths - 101 sites

'''''A Place in the Land''''' is a 1998 American [[short film|short]] [[documentary film]] directed by [[Charles Guggenheim]]. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Best Documentary Short]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/300851/Place-in-the-Land/details |title=NY Times: A Place in the Land |accessdate=December 6, 2008|work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Place in the Land considers the history of conservation stewardship in America as reflected in the property of Billings Farm, an operating dairy farm first established in 1871, and the {{convert|555|acre|km2|adj=on}} Mount Tom, as well as through the work of [[George Perkins Marsh]], [[Frederick Billings]], and [[Laurance Rockefeller]] who were successive residents of the estate. The documentary is shown daily at the visitor center for the [[Billings Farm &amp; Museum]] and the [[Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park]]. The [[National Park Service]] and the American Memory project of the [[Library of Congress]] served as advisers to the Woodstock Foundation in the production of the film.

It also is an intermediate in mixed-oxide ([[MOX]]) fuel fabrication.

[[File:Ammoniumdiuranat.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ammonium diuranate]]
It is [[precipitate]]d by adding aqueous [[ammonium hydroxide]] after uranium extraction by [[tertiary amine]]s in [[kerosene]]. This precipitate is then thickened and centrifuged before being [[Calcination|calcined]] to [[uranium oxide]]. Canadian practice favours the production of [[uranium oxide]] from ammonium diuranate, rather than from [[uranyl nitrate]] as is the case elsewhere.

Ammonium diuranate was once used to produce colored glazes in ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Safford|first=Hurd W.|last2=Kuebel|first2=A.|date=1943-02-01|title=Preparations and properties of ammonium diuranate|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ed020p88|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=20|issue=2|pages=88|doi=10.1021/ed020p88|issn=0021-9584|bibcode = 1943JChEd..20...88S }}&lt;/ref&gt; However when being fired this will decompose to uranium oxide, so the uranate was only used as a lower cost material than the fully purified uranium oxide.

'''Areva Wind''' is a subsidiary of [[Areva]], a French nuclear company. The company designs, assembles, installs and commissions 5-Megawatt [[wind turbines]] for [[offshore wind farm]]s, a growing international industry. Each turbine can produce enough electricity to power 4,000 to 5,000 homes. Areva also designs and manufactures rotor blades through its subsidiary Areva Blades. Areva Wind is headquartered in Bremerhaven, Germany&lt;ref name="areva.com"&gt;http://www.areva.com/EN/operations-412/areva-wind-design-assembly-manufacture-of-offshore-wind-turbines.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Areva Blades is located in Stade, Germany.&lt;ref name="areva.com"/&gt;

Areva Wind produced 6 of 12 turbines for the first German offshore test field alpha ventus and is  producing turbines for commercial wind farms in the North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pretoria.diplo.de/Vertretung/pretoria/en/__pr/GIC/2011/07/07__Alpha__ventus__production.html|title=German Missions in South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oilvoice.com/n/AREVA_wins_400_million_euros_Wind_Farm_Contract_in_Germany/54fded5ed.aspx|title=OilVoice - AREVA wins 400 million euros Wind Farm Contract in Germany|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areva says it is Europe’s second largest offshore wind industry player,&lt;!--doubtful; no place on the Top25 [[List of offshore wind farms]]--&gt; and it will have installed more than 120 turbines in the waters around Europe by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-18/Areva-gdf-suez-vinci-team-up-to-develop-wind-farms-in-france.html|title=Areva, GDF Suez, Vinci Team Up to Develop Wind Farms in France|author=Tara Patel|date=18 May 2011|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is active in the UK and France and has stated that it plans to develop offshore wind in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.Areva.com/EN/home-135/offshore-wind.html|title=Offshore wind - AREVA Group|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Areva Wind began as Multibrid GmbH which, along with Areva Blades, was owned by the energy company Prokon Nord Energiesysteme. The Areva Group first invested in Multibrid in 2007, buying 51% of the company’s shares from Prokon Nord Energiesysteme for €150 million. It bought the remaining 49% of shares in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rechargenews.com/hardcopy/article219860.ece|title=Areva snaps up Multibrid to create new division|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Areva acquired Areva Blades, formerly PN Rotor, and added the subsidiary to its Renewables business group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rechargenews.com/hardcopy/article193832.ece|title=Areva snaps up German turbine-blade manufacturer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
Areva Wind is one of four units in Areva’s Renewable Energies business group (AREVA Renewables). Jean Huby is Areva Wind’s Executive Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windtech-international.com/company-news/areva-names-jean-huby-new-ceo-of-areva-wind|title=AREVA  names Jean Huby new CEO of AREVA Wind|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areva Wind is headquartered in the North of Germany. All of its M5000 wind turbines are developed and manufactured at Bremerhaven. The blades for the M5000 are manufactured in Stade (Areva Blades).&lt;ref name="areva.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.areva.com/EN/operations-413/areva-blades-design-and-manufacture-blades-for-offshore-wind-turbine.html|title=AREVA Blades: design and manufacture blades for offshore wind turbine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both plants are located near the port of Bremerhaven or Hamburg.&lt;ref name="areva.com1"/&gt;

Areva operates a 50/50-joint venture for offshore turbines with [[Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica]] called Adwen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adwenoffshore.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-25818347| title=Wind turbine firms Gamesa and Areva in joint venture | publisher=BBC| accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the year of 2015, Adwen had a market share of 18%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-gamesa-siemens-idUSKCN0WO0YR |title=Siemens ready to buy Areva wind venture in Gamesa deal: paper|author=Reuters Editorial|date=22 March 2016|work=Reuters|accessdate=28 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328102828/https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-gamesa-siemens-idUSKCN0WO0YR |archivedate=28 March 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
The Areva M5000 (the M stands for “Multibrid”, which means multi-megawatts and a hybrid design) is designed for harsh offshore conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://us.areva.com/EN/home-135/offshore-wind.html#tab=tab3 |title=Offshore wind - AREVA Group|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design has been made by [[aerodyn Energiesysteme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/06/areva-multibrids-series-production-an-ambitious-growth-path |title=Areva Multibrid's Series Production: An Ambitious Growth Path|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turbine design has got the iF Design Award 1999 [Bartsch / aerodyn].&lt;ref&gt;http://exhibition.ifdesign.de/winner_en.html?ma_id=7359&lt;/ref&gt; It can power up to 5,000 households, assuming each household consumption of 1 [[kilowatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://us.areva.com/EN/home-135/offshore-wind.html |title=Offshore wind - AREVA Group|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its hybrid drive system and lightweight blades were designed for compactness and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;http://offshore-windport.de/fileadmin/downloads/unternehmen/Multibrid/MB_PROSPEKT_10_uk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Weighing 815 metric tons (including the 500-metric ton tower), the wind turbine operates at wind speeds of 3.5–25&amp;nbsp;m/s. The hub height is 90 m (LAT), and the diameter of the rotor is 116 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thewindpower.net/turbine_technical_en_326_areva_m5000.php |title=Areva M5000-116 - Manufacturers and turbines - Online access - The Wind Power|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The turbine includes a unique anti corrosion system, an innovation which was given the European Inventor AWARD 2008 by the [[European Patent Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.epo.org/learning-events/european-inventor/finalists/2008/siegfriedsen.html |title= Planting wind turbines on the sea|work= [[European Patent Office]] |accessdate= 2017-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winergy and Adwen developed a gearbox for the AD 8-180 turbine (180 m rotor, 8 MW generator). The gearbox weighs 86 tonnes and has an input torque of 10 MNm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offshorewind.biz/2016/09/01/adwen-and-winergy-unveil-worlds-largest-wind-turbine-gearbox/ |title=Adwen and Winergy Unveil World’s Largest Wind Turbine Gearbox |work=Offshore Wind |date=1 September 2016 |accessdate=22 February 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920021819/http://www.offshorewind.biz/2016/09/01/adwen-and-winergy-unveil-worlds-largest-wind-turbine-gearbox |archivedate=20 September 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adwen's new parent Siemens discontinued the AD8 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.windpoweroffshore.com/article/1444951/sgre-drops-adwen-8mw-turbine |title=SGRE drops Adwen 8MW turbine |date=2017-09-19 |access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.windpoweroffshore.com/article/1436083/adwen-restructures-uncertain-future |title=Adwen restructures for uncertain future |date=2017-06-09 |access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
The first prototype was installed in 2004. Three additional onshore turbines were installed in 2008 in order to develop expertise with tripods, large hub heights, erection, lifting equipment, logistics and serial manufacturing.&lt;ref name="renewable-energy-sources.com"&gt;http://www.renewable-energy-sources.com/2009/06/15/alpha-ventus-offshore-project-six-tripods-for-5-mw-m5000-wind-turbines-are-ready/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Areva Wind completed the EPC supply and commissioning of 6 M5000 turbines for the first German offshore wind farm, [[alpha ventus]].&lt;ref name="renewable-energy-sources.com1"&gt;http://www.renewable-energy-sources.com/2009/07/21/alpha-ventus-project-first-areva-multibrid-m5000-wind-turbine-installed/&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha ventus is situated near the German island of Borkum in the North Sea.&lt;ref name="renewable-energy-sources.com1"/&gt; The farm was completed in September 2009 and incorporates 12 wind turbines with a total production of 60 MW.

[[Image:Aubreyhole.jpg|right|thumb|A white disc marks the location of Aubrey hole number 21 on the western side of the southern entrance to Stonehenge. The monument's encircling bank and ditch are visible behind it.]]
The '''Aubrey holes''' are a ring of fifty-six (56) [[chalk]] pits at [[Stonehenge]], named after the seventeenth-century [[antiquarian]] [[John Aubrey]]. They date to the earliest phases of Stonehenge in the late [[fourth millennium BC|fourth]] and early [[third millennium BC]]. Despite decades of argument and analysis, their purpose is still unknown although an [[astronomy|astronomical]] role has often been suggested.

Whilst visiting the monument in 1666, Aubrey noticed five circular cavities in the ground and noted them in his records. These features were ignored or not seen by the later antiquarians to investigate the site, and it was not until the 1920s during the work carried out by Colonel [[William Hawley]] that Hawley's assistant [[Robert Newall]] identified a ring of pits he named in honour of Aubrey and his early survey.

The depressions seen by Aubrey himself are more likely to have been different features from those that now bear his name. [[Mike Pitts (archaeologist)|Mike Pitts]] in a 1981 article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' pointed out that the holes had been backfilled thousands of years before Aubrey visited the site.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, M. W. (5 March 1981). "Stones, Pits and Stonehenge". Nature 290: 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of later cremation burials and [[sarsen]] stone chips in the holes' upper fills supports this. That none of the other antiquarians who visited the site noticed any such holes implies that they were not permanent features either. Pitts argues that they were more likely to be the cavities left by features that had recently been removed. He has suggested that perhaps further megaliths stood at Stonehenge which occupied these other holes and are now lost.

==The Aubrey holes themselves==
Twenty-five of the holes were excavated by Hawley in 1920 and seven more in 1924.  In 1950 [[Stuart Ernest Piggott|Stuart Piggott]] and [[Richard J. C. Atkinson|Richard Atkinson]] dug two more Aubrey Holes which brought the total excavated to thirty-five, including one that [[Richard Colt Hoare]] may have encountered whilst digging beneath the fallen [[Slaughter Stone]] in the early nineteenth century. It was found that the pits were an average of 0.76m deep and 1.06m in diameter. Twenty-five of the pits contained later [[cremation]] burials inserted into their upper fills along with long bone pins which may have secured leather or cloth bags used to hold the remains. Their presence makes Stonehenge Britain's oldest cremation cemetery.

[[Image:Stonehenge phase one.jpg|left|thumb|Plan of Stonehenge 1 with the Aubrey holes shown as white circles. After Cleal et al.]]
The pits appear to have been refilled with the freshly excavated [[chalk]] rubble soon after being dug as no weathering has been noted on the chalk sides of the pits. They may also have been dug out and refilled numerous times. The holes are in an accurate, 271.6m circumference circle, distributed around the edge of the area enclosed by Stonehenge's earth bank, with a [[standard deviation]] in their positioning of 0.4m. The circle they describe is around 5m inside the monument's bank. Twenty-one of the holes remain unexcavated and no reliable dating material has been recovered from the other thirty-five. The only available [[carbon dating|carbon date]] from the holes comes from charcoal in one of the later cremations. It gives the broad range of 2919-1519 cal BC. That [[sarsen]] stone chips have only been found in the upper fills of the excavated pits implies that the digging of the holes predates the megalithic phases of Stonehenge. From this stratigraphic evidence it is therefore likely that the holes were dug during the first phase of the monument, [[Stonehenge#Stonehenge 1|Stonehenge 1]] (around 3100 BC) and were then reused for burials during [[Stonehenge#Stonehenge 2|Stonehenge 2]] in successive centuries. By the time the standing stones of [[Stonehenge#Stonehenge 3|Stonehenge 3]] were erected (around 2600 BC), the holes had fallen out of use.

The positions of the holes are today marked at the Stonehenge site by white discs laid in the ground surface. Archaeologists number them 1 to 56 counting clockwise from the later Slaughter Stone at the eastern side of the north east entrance. Hawley reburied the human cremations he found, placing them in the backfilled hole number 7. These remains were re-excavated in August 2008 as part of the [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]]. A plaque dating from the 1935 reburial was uncovered at the site. The project was detailed in an episode of the [[PBS]] TV series [[Nova (TV series)|Nova]] around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/secrets-stonehenge.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories about the holes==
Many interpretations prefer an astronomical explanation for the purpose of the holes although this is by no means proved. It was thought that{{Weasel inline|date=September 2010}} when the Aubrey holes were first dug, the only standing feature at Stonehenge was the [[Heelstone]], which marked the point of the midsummer sunrise, viewed from the centre of the henge. The Heel Stone is now attributed to Stonehenge 3 and was therefore not contemporary with the holes.

It has been suggested that the Aubrey holes were originally intended to be [[posthole]]s containing timbers or stones but this is uncertain. Analogous [[timber circle]]s at sites such as [[Woodhenge]] have influenced this interpretation; the positioning of the Aubrey Hole circle relative to the earth bank and ditch at Stonehenge is reproduced at similar sites with rings of timber postholes.  That the holes appear to have been filled soon after excavation and then possibly redug does not exclude the possibility that they held timber posts which were replaced intermittently. No evidence of [[postpipe]]s has been recovered with the holes although modern archaeological excavation techniques have not been applied to the pits. If the putative timbers were purposefully removed when they fell out of use, then even this evidence would be difficult to spot however. The lack of full documentation from the early Stonehenge digs in the twentieth century and the disturbance caused by the insertion of the later cremations during Stonehenge 2 have also added to the uncertainty over the function of the holes.

In a survey of twentieth-century excavations at Stonehenge, [[English Heritage]]'s ''[[Stonehenge in its landscape]]'', archaeologist [[Karen Walker (archaeologist)|Karen Walker]] collated and studied the surviving records from all the earlier work on the holes and concluded that "Although the evidence is inconclusive, and will no doubt be the subject of continued debate, the authors are inclined to support the view that the Aubrey Holes held posts, which were removed, rather than burnt in situ or left to decay."&lt;ref&gt;Cleal, R. M. J., Walker, K. E. &amp; Montague, R., ''[[Stonehenge in its landscape]]''. p107 ([[English Heritage]], London, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, further excavation of Aubrey Hole 7 by [[Mike Parker-Pearson]], [[Mike Pitts (archaeologist)|Mike Pitts]] and [[Julian Richards (archaeologist)|Julian Richards]] led the archaeologists to suggest that the 56 holes held Welsh [[Bluestone#Bluestone of Stonehenge|bluestones]], since they are too shallow to be postholes. In fact the holes are identical in width, depth, and shape to the bluestones located elsewhere in Stonehenge.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Parker, Pearson, Stonehenge A New Understanding: Solving the Mysteries of the Greatest Stone Age Monument, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; They are confident that the Aubrey holes belong to Stonehenge's initial phase of construction. Professor Parker-Pearson said: "It's very exciting that we have evidence for stones right from its beginnings around 3000 BC. That's almost 500 years earlier than anyone had thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Stonehenge earlier than believed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/7660860.stm|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeoastronomy and the Aubrey Holes==
The astronomical readings of the holes are largely a product of the interpretation of them as being simple pits without any structural features. This approach has required finding an explanation which tends towards the theory that the holes were repeatedly dug, filled and redug and excludes possibilities relating to any possible timber posts standing in them. The theory that they may have been used to hold temporary markers for use in astronomical observations gained credence in the 1960s.

An early attempt to analyse the positions of the Aubrey holes was undertaken by [[Gerald Hawkins]] a professor of astronomy at [[Boston University]] in the 1960s using an [[IBM 7090]] computer. In his book ''[[Stonehenge Decoded]]'', Hawkins argued that the various features at the Stonehenge monument were arranged in such a way to predict a variety of astronomical events. He believed that the key to the holes' purpose was the [[lunar eclipse]], which occurs on average about once a year on a 346.62&amp;nbsp;day cycle. Lunar eclipses are not always visible as the moon may be below the horizon as it moves across the sky, but over 18 to 19&amp;nbsp;years (18.61&amp;nbsp;years to be precise) the date and position of a visible eclipse will return to its beginning point on the horizon again. As the motion of the moon's orbit also causes it to work its way across the sky on an 18.61&amp;nbsp;year cycle in what is known as the journey between [[major standstill|major]] and [[minor standstill]] and back, the theory that this period was both measurable and useful to Neolithic peoples seemed attractive.

Lunar movements may have had calendrical significance to early peoples, especially farmers who would have benefited from the division of the year into periods which indicated the best times for planting. 18.61 is not a whole number and so it cannot be used to predict an eclipse without precision equipment, using only crude marker stones or timber posts in a circle instead. Hawkins' theory was that three 18.61&amp;nbsp;year cycles multiply out to 55.83, which is much closer to an [[integer]] and therefore easier to mark using 56&amp;nbsp;holes. Hawkins argued that the Aubrey Holes were used to keep track of this long time period and could accurately predict the recurrence of a lunar eclipse on the same [[azimuth]], that which aligned with the Heel Stone, every 56&amp;nbsp;years. Going further, by placing marker stones at the ninth, eighteenth, twenty-eighth, thirty-seventh, forty-sixth and fifty sixth holes, Hawkins deduced that other intermediate lunar eclipses could also be predicted.

More recent examination, notably by Richard Atkinson, has proved Hawkins largely wrong, as it is now established that the different features at the monument that he tried to incorporate into many of his alignment theories were in use at different times and could not have worked alone, the lateness of the installation of the Heel Stone being the final nail in the coffin. Furthermore, the 56&amp;nbsp;year period is not in fact a reliable method of predicting eclipses and it is now accepted that they never repeat their date and position over three consecutive 18.61&amp;nbsp;year-long lunar cycles. Hawkins' theories also required strict observance of the [[lunar phases|phases of the moon]] which further complicated predictions using his model.

In 1966 Sir [[Fred Hoyle]] examined the arguments in favour of an astronomical purpose for the holes and concluded that the 28&amp;nbsp;day lunar cycle could still have been indicated by moving a marker stone representing the moon [[anticlockwise]] by two holes every day, ending up with 56&amp;nbsp;holes in total. By moving another marker anticlockwise two holes every 13&amp;nbsp;days, which represented the Sun, an annual journey around the circle could also be made. Two further marker stones would also have had to be moved round 3&amp;nbsp;holes per year to represent the points where the moon (or rather its marker) crossed the Sun marker's path. Hoyle proved that this could have been used to produce a much more reliable method of predicting [[eclipse]]s as whenever the moon and sun markers are directly opposite each other and the other two stones occupy those same opposing points, an eclipse can be guaranteed. This also has the additional benefit of not needing any standing stones to be present at the site.

Although less complex and romantic than Hawkins' 'stone age calculator' such a technique is certainly feasible if only in theory. Much more elaborate predictive practices have also been suggested for the holes although all these methods, including Hoyle's, require a high level of astronomical awareness and a grasp of some very abstract concepts including knowing where and when to first position the stones around the circle. It has also been pointed out by R. Colton and R. L. Martin that simpler methods exist, based on observing the position of each moonrise, which would have worked just as well and which would not require moving numerous markers amongst 56&amp;nbsp;holes. This diminishes the astronomical significance of the number of the Aubrey Holes and their circular arrangement and tends to suggest that any astronomical purpose for the site may have been no more than symbolic.

On astronomical symbolism several analysts from Gerald Hawkins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=January 2004 |title=Gerald Hawkins |department=Obituary |magazine=British Archeology |issue=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Anthony Johnson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Anthony |year=2008 |title=Solving Stonehenge: The new key to an ancient enigma |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-05155-9 |pages=259-260}}&lt;/ref&gt; have noted that Plutarch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Plutarch |author-link=Plutarch |title=Moralia |at=V}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that Typhon / Seth in Egyptian and Greek myth was identified as the shadow of the Earth which covers the Moon during lunar eclipses. Plutarch further records that the Pythagoreans symbolically associated Typhon with a polygon of 56&amp;nbsp;sides, hence the connection of 56 to lunar eclipses is explicit, at least for the Hellenistic era.

According to the astrologers [[Bruno Huber|Bruno and Louise Huber]] the Aubrey holes were an astronomical abacus to mark the positions and calculate the movement of [[lunar nodes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Huber, B. |author1-link=Bruno Huber |author2=Huber, L. |year=1995 |title=Moon-Node Astrology |location=York Beach, Maine |publisher=Samuel Weiser, Inc. |pages=8–10 |ISBN=0-87728-784-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extra-astronomical interpretations==
Mike Pitts has asserted that the Aubrey Holes did in fact originally hold timbers and compares the site at this stage to Woodhenge, [[The Sanctuary]] and other Neolithic timber circles. Such a view contradicts the archaeo-astronomical view of the holes as being a unique predictive device.

In fact, early Stonehenge may have been barely different from the other Neolithic [[timber circle]]s of the British Isles which had varying numbers of postholes and orientations and could therefore not have been used for in island-wide eclipse predicting. The interpretation of such timber circles is unclear, although parallels were drawn with [[North American Indians|Native American]] [[totem pole]]s by [[Stuart Piggott]] in a 1946 [[BBC]] radio lecture. A 50&amp;nbsp;cm high carved wooden figure found in the Thames Marshes in 1912 and carbon dated to 2460-1980&amp;nbsp;BCE has been used rather tenuously to support the theory of carved wooden posts serving a more terrestrial purpose.

Another possible explanation for the holes, suggested by Richard Atkinson, is that they were excavated in turn in some unknown [[ritual]] involving a procession around the inside of the monument. Others have pointed out the significance of the 28&amp;nbsp;day human [[menstrual cycle]] and argued that the holes may have been fertility indicators. [[Alexander Thom]] calculated that the circle of holes had been laid out in a circumference of 131 of his [[megalithic rod]]s although this number has no known significance. A recent CAD study of the holes has shown that a 56&amp;nbsp;sided polygon can be generated by the simple use of square and circle geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Anthony |year=2008 |title=Solving Stonehenge: The new key to an ancient enigma |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-05155-9 |pages=208–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aubrey Burl also notes that the azimuth of the Heel Stone, beyond the Aubrey Circle, marks the midpoint in the swing of the Moon between major and minor standstill points, at 51.3&amp;nbsp;degrees.&lt;ref name="Burl1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |title=Great Stone Circles: Fables, fictions, facts |year=1999 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |isbn=0-300-07689-4 |pages=130–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The true purpose of the holes may never be known, although future excavation of the remaining twenty-four using modern archaeological techniques will certainly provide more information.

'''Boron nitride''' is a heat and chemically resistant [[refractory]] compound of [[boron]] and [[nitrogen]] with the [[chemical formula]] '''BN'''. It exists in various [[Polymorphism (materials science)|crystalline forms]] that are [[isoelectronic]] to a similarly structured [[carbon]] lattice. The [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal form]] corresponding to [[graphite]] is the most stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic ([[Zincblende (crystal structure)#Zincblende structure|sphalerite structure]]) variety analogous to [[diamond]] is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare [[Wurtzite crystal structure|wurtzite]] BN modification is similar to [[lonsdaleite]] and may even be harder than the cubic form.

Because of excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has potential use in nanotechnology. Nanotubes of BN can be produced that have a structure similar to that of [[carbon nanotube]]s, i.e. [[graphene]] (or BN) sheets rolled on themselves, but the properties are very different.

==Structure==
Boron nitride exists in multiple forms that differ in the arrangement of the boron and nitrogen atoms, giving rise to varying bulk properties of the material.

=== Amorphous form (a-BN) ===

The amorphous form of boron nitride (a-BN) is non-crystalline, lacking any long-distance regularity in the arrangement of its atoms. It is analogous to [[amorphous carbon]].

All other forms of boron nitride are crystalline.

=== Hexagonal form (h-BN) ===

The most stable crystalline form is the hexagonal one, also called h-BN, α-BN, g-BN, and ''graphitic boron nitride''. Hexagonal boron nitride (point group = D&lt;sub&gt;6h&lt;/sub&gt;; space group = P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/mmc) has a layered structure similar to graphite. Within each layer, boron and nitrogen atoms are bound by strong [[covalent bond]]s, whereas the layers are held together by weak [[van der Waals force]]s. The interlayer "registry" of these sheets differs, however, from the pattern seen for graphite, because the atoms are eclipsed, with boron atoms lying over and above nitrogen atoms. This registry reflects the polarity of the B–N bonds. Still, h-BN and graphite are very close neighbors and even the BC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N hybrids have been synthesized where carbon substitutes for some B and N atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kawaguchi, M. | title = Electronic Structure and Intercalation Chemistry of Graphite-Like Layered Material with a Composition of BC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N | journal = Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids | volume = 69 | year = 2008 | page = 1171 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpcs.2007.10.076 |issue = 5–6 |bibcode = 2008JPCS...69.1171K |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cubic form (c-BN) ===

Cubic boron nitride has a crystal structure analogous to that of [[diamond]]. Consistent with diamond being less stable than graphite, the cubic form is less stable than the hexagonal form, but the conversion rate between the two is negligible at room temperature, as it is for diamond. The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure, the same as that of diamond, and is also called β-BN or c-BN.

=== Wurtzite form (w-BN) ===

The [[Wurtzite crystal structure|wurtzite]] form of boron nitride (w-BN; point group = C&lt;sub&gt;6v&lt;/sub&gt;; space group = P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;mc) has the same structure as [[lonsdaleite]], a rare hexagonal polymorph of carbon. As in the cubic form, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into [[tetrahedra]], but in w-BN the angles between neighboring tetrahedra are different.{{clarify|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Silberberg, M. S. | title = Chemistry: The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change | edition = 5th | location = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2009 | page = 483 |isbn=0073048593}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the cubic form, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into 6-membered rings; in the cubic form all rings are in the [[chair configuration]], in w-BN the rings between 'layers' are in [[boat configuration]]. The Wurtzite form is thought to be very strong, and was estimated by a simulation as potentially having a strength 18% stronger than that of diamond, but because only small amounts of the mineral exist in nature, this has not yet been experimentally verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16610-diamond-no-longer-natures-hardest-material/ |title=Diamond no longer nature’s hardest material |last=Griggs |first=Jessica  |date=2014-05-13 |website=New Scientist |language=en-US |access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partly [[ionic bond|ionic]] structure of BN layers in h-BN reduces covalency and electrical conductivity, whereas the interlayer interaction increases resulting in higher hardness of h-BN relative to graphite. The reduced electron-delocalization in hexagonal-BN is also indicated by its absence of color and a large [[band gap]]. Very different bonding – strong covalent within the [[basal plane]]s (planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded) and weak between them – causes high [[anisotropy]] of most properties of h-BN.

For example, the hardness, electrical and thermal conductivity are much higher within the planes than perpendicular to them. On the contrary, the properties of c-BN and w-BN are more homogeneous and isotropic.

Those materials are extremely hard, with the hardness of bulk c-BN being slightly smaller and w-BN even higher than that of diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pan, Z. | title = Harder than Diamond: Superior Indentation Strength of Wurtzite BN and Lonsdaleite | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 102 | page = 055503 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.055503 | pmid = 19257519 | bibcode = 2009PhRvL.102e5503P | issue = 5 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polycrystalline c-BN with grain sizes on the order of 10&amp;nbsp;nm is also reported to have [[Vickers hardness]] comparable or higher than diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tian, Yongjun |doi=10.1038/nature11728|title=Ultrahard nanotwinned cubic boron nitride|year=2013|journal=Nature|volume=493|issue=7432|pages=385–8|pmid=23325219|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2013Natur.493..385T }}

===Thermal stability===
Hexagonal and cubic (and probably w-BN) BN show remarkable chemical and thermal stabilities. For example, h-BN is stable to decomposition at temperatures up to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C in air, 1400&amp;nbsp;°C in vacuum, and 2800&amp;nbsp;°C in an inert atmosphere. The reactivity of h-BN and c-BN is relatively similar, and the data for c-BN are summarized in the table below.

Thermal stability of c-BN can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;
*In air or oxygen: B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; protective layer prevents further oxidation to ~1300&amp;nbsp;°C; no conversion to hexagonal form at 1400&amp;nbsp;°C.
*In nitrogen: some conversion to h-BN at 1525&amp;nbsp;°C after 12&amp;nbsp;h.
*In vacuum ({{val|e=-5|u=Pa}}): conversion to h-BN at 1550–1600&amp;nbsp;°C.

===Chemical stability===
Boron nitride is insoluble in the usual acids, but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and nitrides, such as [[Lithium hydroxide|LiOH]], [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]]-[[Sodium carbonate|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Sodium nitrate|NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium nitride|Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N]], [[Magnesium nitride|Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Strontium nitride|Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Barium nitride|Ba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] or [[Lithium boron nitride|Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which are therefore used to etch BN.&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

===Thermal conductivity===
The theoretical thermal conductivity of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) can approach 1700–2000 W/(m·K), which has the same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for [[graphene]], and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lan, J.

The thermal conductivity of zigzag-edged BNNRs is about 20% larger than that of armchair-edged nanoribbons at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Thermal Transport in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanoribbons | doi = 10.1088/0957-4484/21/24/245701 | journal = Nanotechnology | volume = 21 | issue = 24 | year = 2010 | page = 245701 |bibcode = 2010Nanot..21x5701O | last1 = Ouyang | first1 = Tao | last2 = Chen | first2 = Yuanping | last3 = Xie | first3 = Yuee | last4 = Yang | first4 = Kaike | last5 = Bao | first5 = Zhigang | last6 = Zhong | first6 = Jianxin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
In 2009, a naturally occurring boron nitride mineral in the cubic form (c-BN) was reported in [[Tibet]], with a proposed name of ''[[qingsongite]]''. The substance was found in dispersed [[micron]]-sized inclusions in chromium-rich rocks. In 2013, the International Mineralogical Association affirmed the mineral and the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dobrzhinetskaya, L.F. |year=2013|title=Qingsongite, IMA 2013-030|journal=CNMNC Newsletter|volume=16|pages=2708|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dobrzhinetskaya, L.F. |year=2014|title=Qingsongite, natural cubic boron nitride: The first boron mineral from the Earth's mantle|journal=American Mineralogist|volume=99|issue=4|pages=764–772|url=http://www.minsocam.org/msa/ammin/toc/Abstracts/2014_Abstracts/APR14_Abstracts/Dobr_p764_14.pdf|doi=10.2138/am.2014.4714|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2014AmMin..99..764D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==

===Preparation and reactivity of hexagonal BN===
Boron nitride is produced synthetically. Hexagonal boron nitride is obtained by the reacting boron trioxide (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or boric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[urea]] (CO(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in a nitrogen atmosphere:&lt;ref name=prod&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rudolph, S. | journal = American Ceramic Society Bulletin | volume = 79 | year = 2000 | page = 50 | url = http://www.a-m.de/deu/literatur/cb0600.html | title = Boron Nitride (BN) | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120306221940/http://www.a-m.de/deu/literatur/cb0600.html | archivedate = 2012-03-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting disordered ([[amorphous]]) boron nitride contains 92–95% BN and 5–8% B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The remaining B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be evaporated in a second step at temperatures {{nowrap|&gt; 1500 °C}} in order to achieve BN concentration &gt;98%. Such annealing also crystallizes BN, the size of the crystallites increasing with the annealing temperature.&lt;ref name=dkg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hubacek.jp/bn/bn.htm | accessdate = 2009-06-06 | title = Synthesis of Boron Nitride from Oxide Precursors | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071212115253/http://hubacek.jp/bn/bn.htm | archivedate = December 12, 2007 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

h-BN parts can be fabricated inexpensively by hot-pressing with subsequent machining. The parts are made from boron nitride powders adding boron oxide for better compressibility.

===Preparation of cubic BN===
Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods as that of diamond: Cubic boron nitride is produced by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as [[synthetic diamond]] is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18&amp;nbsp;GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230&amp;nbsp;°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion.&lt;ref name=wentorf&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wentorf, R.

As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine.&lt;ref name=vel&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0921-5107(91)90121-B | title = Cubic Boron Nitride: Synthesis, Physicochemical Properties and Applications | author = Vel, L. | journal = Materials Science and Engineering: B | volume = 10 | year = 1991 | page = 149 | issue = 2 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fukunaga, O. | title = Science and Technology in the Recent Development of Boron Nitride Materials | year = 2002 | journal = Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter | volume = 14 | page = 10979 | doi = 10.1088/0953-8984/14/44/413 | issue = 44 |bibcode = 2002JPCM...1410979F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature gradient, or explosive [[shock wave]]. The shock wave method is used to produce material called [[heterodiamond]], a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Komatsu, T. | title = Creation of Superhard B–C–N Heterodiamond Using an Advanced Shock Wave Compression Technology | journal = Journal of Materials Processing Technology | volume = 85 | year = 1999 | page = 69 | doi = 10.1016/S0924-0136(98)00263-5 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-pressure deposition of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, the major problem is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, [[boron trifluoride]] is used for c-BN. [[Ion beam deposition]], [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]], [[pulsed laser deposition]], [[Sputter deposition|reactive sputtering]], and other [[physical vapor deposition]] methods are used as well.&lt;ref name=cvd/&gt;

===Preparation of wurtzite BN===
Wurtzite BN can be obtained via static high-pressure or dynamic shock methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Characterization of Wurtzite Type Boron Nitride Synthesized by Shock Compression | author = Soma, T. | journal = Materials Research Bulletin | volume = 9 | year = 1974 | page = 755 | doi = 10.1016/0025-5408(74)90110-X | issue = 6 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limits of its stability are not well defined. Both c-BN and w-BN are formed by compressing h-BN, but formation of w-BN occurs at much lower temperatures close to 1700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=vel/&gt;

===Production statistics===
Whereas the production and consumption figures for the raw materials used for BN synthesis, namely boric acid and boron trioxide, are well known (see [[boron]]), the corresponding numbers for the boron nitride are not listed in statistical reports. An estimate for the 1999 world production is 300 to 350 metric tons. The major producers and consumers of BN are located in the United States, Japan, China and Germany. In 2000, prices varied from about $75/kg to $120/kg for standard industrial-quality h-BN and were about up to $200–$400/kg for high purity BN grades.&lt;ref name=prod/&gt;

==Applications==

===Hexagonal BN===
{{main|Synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride}}
[[Image:BNcrucible.jpg|thumb|right|Ceramic BN crucible]]
Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is the most widely used polymorph. It is a good lubricant at both low and high temperatures (up to 900&amp;nbsp;°C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in [[cosmetics]], [[paint]]s, [[dental cement]]s, and [[pencil]] leads.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book |author1=Greim, Jochen |author2=Schwetz, Karl A. | chapter = Boron Carbide, Boron Nitride, and Metal Borides | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a04_295.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexagonal BN was first used in cosmetics around 1940 in [[Japan]]. However, because of its high price, h-BN was soon abandoned for this application. Its use was revitalized in the late 1990s with the optimization h-BN production processes, and currently h-BN is used by nearly all leading producers of cosmetic products for [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundations]], [[make-up]], [[eye shadow]]s, blushers, [[eye liner|kohl pencils]], [[lipstick]]s and other skincare products.&lt;ref name=dkg/&gt;

Because of its excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] and in steelmaking.&lt;ref name=dkg/&gt; Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis, R.F. | title = III-V Nitrides for Electronic and Optoelectronic Applications | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | year = 1991 | volume= 79 | pages = 702–712 | doi = 10.1109/5.90133 | issue= 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as dielectric in resistive random access memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Chengbin|last2=Ji|first2=Yanfeng|last3=Xiao|first3=Na|last4=Hui|first4=Fei|last5=Tang|first5=Kechao|last6=Guo|first6=Yuzheng|last7=Xie|first7=Xiaoming|last8=Puglisi|first8=Francesco M.|last9=Larcher|first9=Luca|date=2017-01-01|title=Coexistence of Grain-Boundaries-Assisted Bipolar and Threshold Resistive Switching in Multilayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.201604811/abstract|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|volume=27|issue=10|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1002/adfm.201604811|issn=1616-3028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puglisi|first=F.

The binder utilizes the unique temperature stability and insulating properties of h-BN.&lt;ref name=dkg/&gt;

Parts can be made by [[hot pressing]] from four commercial grades of h-BN. Grade HBN contains a [[boron trioxide|boron oxide]] [[binder (material)|binder]]; it is usable up to 550–850&amp;nbsp;°C in oxidizing atmosphere and up to 1600&amp;nbsp;°C in vacuum, but due to the boron oxide content is sensitive to water. Grade HBR uses a [[calcium borate]] binder and is usable at 1600&amp;nbsp;°C. Grades HBC and HBT contain no binder and can be used up to 3000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Harper, Charles A. | title = Handbook of Ceramics, Glasses and Diamonds | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2001 | isbn = 007026712X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

h-BN has been used since the mid-2000s as a bullet and bore lubricant in precision target rifle applications as an alternative to [[molybdenum disulfide]] coating, commonly referred to as "moly". It is claimed to increase effective barrel life, increase intervals between bore cleaning, and decrease the deviation in point of impact between clean bore first shots and subsequent shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bulletin.accurateshooter.com/2014/09/hexagonal-boron-nitride-hbn-how-well-does-it-work/ | title = Hexagonal Boron Nitride (HBN) — How Well Does It Work? | author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | date = 8 September 2014 | website = AccurateShooter.com | access-date = 28 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cubic boron nitride===
Cubic boron nitride (CBN or c-BN) is widely used as an [[abrasive]].&lt;ref name="mprg"&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Todd RH, Allen DK, Dell KAlting L | year = 1994 | title = Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide | publisher = Industrial Press Inc. | pages = 43–48 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6x1smAf_PAcC | isbn = 0-8311-3049-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its usefulness arises from its insolubility in [[iron]], [[nickel]], and related [[alloy]]s at high temperatures, whereas diamond is soluble in these metals to give carbides. Polycrystalline c-BN (PCBN) abrasives are therefore used for machining steel, whereas diamond abrasives are preferred for aluminum alloys, ceramics, and stone. When in contact with oxygen at high temperatures, BN forms a passivation layer of boron oxide. Boron nitride binds well with metals, due to formation of interlayers of metal borides or nitrides. Materials with cubic boron nitride crystals are often used in the [[tool bit]]s of [[cutting tool]]s. For grinding applications, softer binders, e.g. resin, porous ceramics, and soft metals, are used. Ceramic binders can be used as well. Commercial products are known under names "[[Borazon]]" (by Diamond Innovations), and "Elbor" or "Cubonite" (by Russian vendors).&lt;ref name=b1/&gt; 

Contrary to diamond, large c-BN pellets can be produced in a simple process (called sintering) of annealing c-BN powders in nitrogen flow at temperatures slightly below the BN decomposition temperature. This ability of c-BN and h-BN powders to fuse allows cheap production of large BN parts.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

Similar to diamond, the combination in c-BN of highest thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity is ideal for [[heat spreader]]s. 

As cubic boron nitride consists of light atoms and is very robust chemically and mechanically, it is one of the popular materials for X-ray membranes: low mass results in small X-ray absorption, and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=El Khakani, M. A. |author2=Chaker, M. | title = Physical Properties of the X-Ray Membrane Materials | journal = Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B | volume = 11 | pages = 2930–2937 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1116/1.586563 | issue = 6 |bibcode = 1993JVSTB..11.2930E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amorphous boron nitride===
Layers of amorphous boron nitride (a-BN) are used in some [[semiconductor device]]s, e.g. [[MOSFET]]s. They can be prepared by chemical decomposition of [[trichloroborazine|trichloro]][[borazine]] with [[caesium]], or by thermal chemical vapor deposition methods. Thermal CVD can be also used for deposition of h-BN layers, or at high temperatures, c-BN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schmolla, W. | title = Positive Drift Effect of BN-InP Enhancement N-Channel MISFET | doi =10.1080/00207218508939000 | journal = International Journal of Electronics | volume = 58 | year = 1985 | page = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms of boron nitride==
=== Atomically thin boron nitride ===
Hexagonal boron nitride can be exfoliated to mono or few atomic layer sheets. Due to its analogous structure to that of graphene but white appearance, atomically thin boron nitride is sometimes call “white graphene”.&lt;ref name="LiChen2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Lu Hua|last2=Chen|first2=Ying|title=Atomically Thin Boron Nitride: Unique Properties and Applications|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|volume=26|issue=16|year=2016|pages=2594–2608|issn=1616301X|doi=10.1002/adfm.201504606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechanical properties.''' Atomically thin boron nitride is one of the strongest electrically insulating materials. Monolayer boron nitride has an average Young’s modulus of 0.865TPa and fracture strength of 70.5GPa, and in contrast to graphene, whose strength decreases dramatically with increased thickness, few-layer boron nitride sheets have a strength similar to that of monolayer boron nitride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falin|first=Aleksey|last2=Cai|first2=Qiran|last3=Santos|first3=Elton J.G.|last4=Scullion|first4=Declan|last5=Qian|first5=Dong|last6=Zhang|first6=Rui|last7=Yang|first7=Zhi|last8=Huang|first8=Shaoming|last9=Watanabe|first9=Kenji|date=2017-06-22|title=Mechanical properties of atomically thin boron nitride and the role of interlayer interactions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15815|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15815|doi=10.1038/ncomms15815|issn=2041-1723|bibcode=2017NatCo...815815F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermal conductivity.''' Atomically thin boron nitride has one of the highest thermal conductivity coefficients among semiconductors and electrical insulators, and its thermal conductivity increases with reduced thickness due to less intra-layer coupling.

'''Thermal stability.''' The air stability of graphene shows a clear thickness dependence: monolayer graphene is reactive to oxygen at 250°C, strongly doped at 300°C, and etched at 450°C; in contrast, bulk graphite is not oxidized until 800°C.&lt;ref name="LiSantos2014"/&gt; Atomically thin boron nitride has much better oxidation resistance than graphene.

'''Dielectric properties.''' Atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride is an excellent dielectric substrate for graphene, molybdenum disulphide (MoS&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;), and many other 2D material-based electronic and photonic devices. As shown by electric force microscopy (EFM) studies, the electric field screening in atomically thin boron nitride shows a weak dependence on thickness, which is in line with the smooth decay of electric field inside few-layer boron nitride revealed by the first-principles calculations.&lt;ref name="LiSantos2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Lu Hua|last2=Santos|first2=Elton J.

'''Raman characteristics.''' Raman spectroscopy has been a useful tool to study a variety of 2D materials, and the Raman signature of high-quality atomically thin boron nitride was first reported by Gorbachev et al&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorbachev|first=Roman V.|last2=Riaz|first2=Ibtsam|last3=Nair|first3=Rahul R.|last4=Jalil|first4=Rashid|last5=Britnell|first5=Liam|last6=Belle|first6=Branson D.|last7=Hill|first7=Ernie W.|last8=Novoselov|first8=Kostya S.|last9=Watanabe|first9=Kenji|date=2011-01-07|title=Hunting for Monolayer Boron Nitride: Optical and Raman Signatures|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smll.201001628|journal=Small|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=465–468|doi=10.1002/smll.201001628|issn=1613-6810}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Li et al.&lt;ref name="LiCervenka2014"/&gt; However, the two reported Raman results of monolayer boron nitride did not agree with each other.

Nevertheless, the Raman intensity of G band of atomically thin boron nitride can be used to estimate layer thickness and sample quality.[[Image:STMnm-2.JPG|thumb|left|150px|BN nanomesh observed with a [[scanning tunneling microscope]].

Structurally, it is a close analog of the [[carbon nanotube]], namely a long cylinder with diameter of several to hundred nanometers and length of many micrometers, except carbon atoms are alternately substituted by nitrogen and boron atoms. However, the properties of BN nanotubes are very different: whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius, a BN nanotube is an electrical insulator with a bandgap of ~5.5 eV, basically independent of tube chirality and morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1209/0295-5075/28/5/007 | title = Stability and Band Gap Constancy of Boron Nitride Nanotubes | year = 1994 | author = Blase, X. | journal = Europhysics Letters (EPL) | volume = 28 | page = 335 | issue = 5 |bibcode = 1994EL.....28..335B |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a layered BN structure is much more thermally and chemically stable than a graphitic carbon structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.glue.umd.edu/~cumings/PDF%20Publications/15.APL81han.pdf | doi = 10.1063/1.1498494 | title = Transformation of B&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; Nanotubes to Pure BN Nanotubes | year = 2002 | author = Han, Wei-Qiang | journal = Applied Physics Letters | volume = 81 | page = 1110 | issue = 6 |bibcode = 2002ApPhL..81.1110H |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=golberg&gt;{{cite journal | title = Boron Nitride Nanotubes | doi = 10.1002/adma.200700179 | journal = Advanced Materials | volume = 19 | year = 2007 | page = 2413 | issue = 18 | last1 = Golberg | first1 = D. | last2 = Bando | first2 = Y. | last3 = Tang | first3 = C. C. | last4 = Zhi | first4 = C. Y. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boron nitride aerogel===
{{main|Boron nitride aerogel}}
Boron nitride aerogel is an [[aerogel]] made of highly porous BN. It typically consists of a mixture of deformed BN nanotubes and [[Boron nitride nanosheet|nanosheets]]. It can have a density as low as 0.6 mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a specific surface area as high as 1050 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g, and therefore has potential applications as an [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]], catalyst support and gas storage medium. BN aerogels are highly [[hydrophobic]] and can absorb up to 160 times their weight in oil. They are resistant to oxidation in air at temperatures up to 1200 °C, and hence can be reused after the absorbed oil is burned out by flame. BN aerogels can be prepared by template-assisted [[chemical vapor deposition]] using [[borazine]] as the feed gas.&lt;ref name=nat/&gt; 

===Composites containing BN===
Addition of boron nitride to [[silicon nitride]] ceramics improves the [[thermal shock]] resistance of the resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-[[alumina]] and [[titanium nitride]]-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and [[zirconia]], [[borosilicate glass]]es, [[glass ceramic]]s, [[vitreous enamel|enamels]], and composite ceramics with [[titanium boride]]-boron nitride, titanium boride-[[aluminium nitride]]-boron nitride, and [[silicon carbide]]-boron nitride composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Handbook of Composite Reinforcements | author = Lee, S. M. | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 1992 | isbn = 0471188611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health issues==
Boron nitride (along with Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, NbN, and BNC) is reported to show weak [[fibrogenic]] activity, and to cause [[pneumoconiosis]] when inhaled in particulate form. The maximum concentration recommended for nitrides of nonmetals is 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for BN and 4 for AlN or ZrN.&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

'''''Catching the Sun''''' is a 2015 [[documentary film]] on the growth of the [[solar power]] industry that premiered on [[Netflix]] in April, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charlie-saginaw/the-hidden-green-in-earth_b_9739738.html|title=The Hidden Green in Earth Day|last=Saginaw|first=Charlie|date=2016-04-21|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by [[Shalini Kantayya]], the film features portraits of diverse personalities and their roles in the [[renewable energy commercialization|transition to solar power]]. Unemployed workers in [[Richmond, California]], businessmen in China, [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] activists, and would be [[White House]] adviser are all featured in the film. The film debunks a [[false dilemma]] that [[clean energy]] requires sacrificing economic prosperity.

== Synopsis ==
The film begins with the [[Chevron Richmond Refinery#2012 fire|2012 Chevron refinery fire]] in [[Richmond, California]]  and contrasts the possibilities for Richmond of an energy sector based on [[solar power|solar installation]] versus continued pollution and economic stagnation from an [[energy industry]] rooted on the [[oil refinery]].&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/la-et-mn-mini-catching-the-sun-review-20160408-story.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The film gives a short history of [[Solar power in the United States|solar technology in the United States]], and the road not taken when, on his first day in office, [[Ronald Reagan]] removed the solar panels [[Jimmy Carter]] had placed on the White House, and abandoned policies to further [[Renewable energy commercialization|solar development]].&lt;ref name="theepochtimes.com"&gt;[http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2001916-documentary-review-catching-the-sun-a-solar-energy-shot-of-climate-change-hope/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt;

The film features unemployed workers in Northern California receiving [[Green-collar worker|Green-collar job]] training from [[Solar Richmond]] to work in the emergent field of solar installation.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/movies/review-catching-the-sun-profiles-solar-energy-entrepreneurs-and-activists.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Van Jones]] features prominently in the documentary, which depicts his early work in [[Green for All]], his family's relocation from Oakland to Washington, DC to take advantage of a White House job offer, and Jones's subsequent resignation in the face sustained attacks from conservative media.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Conservative Debbie Dooley from [[Atlanta, Georgia]] rejects an ideological divide between the left and right on clean energy.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Through her organization, Conservatives for Energy Freedom, she advocates for [[clean energy]] by breaking down barriers that favor the incumbent energy industry and restrict a true free market.

While ideological gridlock weighs on American energy policy, other countries move forward. A profile on Zhongwei Jiang, a Chinese entrepreneur based in [[Wuxi, China]] gives perspective on solar growth in Germany, India, and China. Jiang, who grew up without electricity until the age of seven, founded the solar company WesTech in 2003.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Jiang conducts an international business in solar products and dreams of a "Solar City" in Texas where thousands of Americans would be employed in the solar sector.&lt;ref name="theepochtimes.com"/&gt;

== Director ==
The film is the documentary debut for Indian-born and Brooklyn-based, eco-activist and filmmaker [[Shalini Kantayya]].&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filmindependent.org"&gt;[http://www.filmindependent.org/blog/how-one-indie-filmmaker-went-from-being-on-the-lot-to-saving-the-planet/]&lt;/ref&gt; Kantayya had a career breakthrough when she became a finalist in the 2007 reality TV show ''[[On the Lot]]''.&lt;ref name="filmindependent.org"/&gt;

== Release ==
The film debuted at the 2015 [[LA Film Festival]] and had a limited theatrical release in the United States in Spring 2016. ''Catching the Sun'' made its public debut on Earth Day 2016 on [[Netflix]].

The '''Coal Authority''' is a [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[United Kingdom government]].

==History==
It was established under the '''Coal Industry Act 1994''' to manage some functions, in which the [[British Coal Corporation]] (formerly the [[National Coal Board]]) had previously undertaken, including ownership of unworked coal. Its offices are in [[Mansfield]], [[Nottinghamshire]]. It was funded by the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]], and now the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] (headed by [[Greg Clark]]) funds it.

==Function==
[[Image:Coal mines on Threshfield Moor - geograph.org.uk - 150196.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Coal Authority sign on former mine on Threshfield Moor in North Yorkshire]]
It is responsible for licensing coal mining operations, and for providing information on coal reserves and past and future coal mining. It settles subsidence claims not falling on coal mining operators. It deals with the management and disposal of property, and with surface hazards, such as abandoned coal mine shafts. It operates a twenty four hour call out service for surface hazards.

The '''Cockcroft–Walton''' ('''CW''') '''generator''', or '''multiplier''', is an [[electric circuit]] that generates a high [[Direct current|DC]] [[voltage]] from a low-voltage [[Alternating current|AC]] or pulsing DC input.  It was named after the British and Irish physicists [[John Douglas Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton|Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton]], who in 1932 used this circuit design to power their [[particle accelerator]], performing the first artificial nuclear disintegration in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Mechanics |last1=Kleppner |first1=Daniel |last2=Kolenkow |first2=Robert J. |year=1973 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Boston |isbn=0-07-035048-5 |page=498 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They used this [[voltage multiplier]] cascade for most of their research, which in 1951 won them the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for "Transmutation of atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles". The circuit was discovered in 1919, by [[Heinrich Greinacher]], a Swiss [[physicist]]. For this reason, this doubler cascade is sometimes also referred to as the '''Greinacher multiplier'''.  Cockcroft–Walton circuits are still used in particle accelerators. They also are used in everyday electronic devices that require high voltages, such as [[X-ray machine]]s, [[television set]]s, [[microwave oven]]s and [[photocopier]]s.

==Operation==

[[Image:CW building.jpg|right|thumb|Output with some capacitor on a CW circuit]]
[[Image:Full wave Cockcroft Walton Voltage multiplier.png|right|thumb|A three-stage full-wave CW multiplier]]

The CW is a [[voltage multiplier]] that converts AC or pulsing DC electrical power from a low [[voltage]] level to a higher DC voltage level.  It is made up of a voltage multiplier ladder network of [[capacitor]]s and [[diode]]s to generate high voltages. Unlike [[transformer]]s, this method eliminates the requirement for the heavy core and the bulk of insulation/potting required. Using only capacitors and diodes, these voltage multipliers can step up relatively low voltages to extremely high values, while at the same time being far lighter and cheaper than transformers. The biggest advantage of such circuits is that the [[voltage]] across each stage of the cascade is equal to only twice the peak input voltage in a half-wave rectifier.  In a full-wave rectifier it is three times the input voltage.  It has the advantage of requiring relatively low-cost components and being easy to insulate. One can also tap the output from any stage, like in a multitapped transformer.

To understand the circuit operation, see the diagram of the two-stage version at right.  Assume the circuit is powered by an alternating voltage '''''V''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' with a peak value of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, and initially the capacitors are uncharged.  After the input voltage is turned on  
*When the input voltage '''''V''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' reaches its negative peak  −''V''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, current flows through diode ''D1'' to charge capacitor ''C1'' to a voltage of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.  
*When  '''''V''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' reverses polarity and reaches its positive peak +''V''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, it adds to the capacitor's voltage to produce a voltage of 2''V''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; on ''C1''s righthand plate.   Since ''D1'' is reverse-biased, current flows from ''C1'' through diode ''D2'', charging capacitor ''C2'' to a voltage of 2''V''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.  
*When  '''''V''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' reverses polarity again, current from ''C2'' flows through diode ''D3'', charging capacitor ''C3'' also to a voltage of  2''V''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.
*When  '''''V''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' reverses polarity again, current from ''C3'' flows through diode ''D4'', charging capacitor ''C4'' also to a voltage of  2''V''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.  
With each change in input polarity, current flows up the "stack" of capacitors through the diodes, until they are all charged.   All the capacitors are charged to a voltage of 2''V''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, except for ''C1'', which is charged to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.  The key to the voltage multiplication is that while the capacitors are charged in parallel, they are connected to the load in series.  Since ''C2'' and ''C4'' are in series between the output and ground, the total output voltage (under no-load conditions)  is '''''V''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 4''V''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. 

This circuit can be extended to any number of stages.  The no-load output voltage is twice the peak input voltage  multiplied by the number of stages '''''N''''' or equivalently the [[peak-to-peak]] input voltage swing (''V''&lt;sub&gt;pp&lt;/sub&gt;) times the number of stages
:&lt;math&gt;V_o = 2NV_p = NV_\text{pp},&lt;/math&gt;
The number of stages is equal to the number of capacitors in series between the output and ground.

One way to look at the circuit is that it functions as a charge "pump", pumping electric charge in one direction, up the stack of capacitors.   The CW circuit, along with other similar capacitor circuits, is often called [[charge pump]]. For substantial loads, the charge on the capacitors is partially depleted, and the output voltage drops according to the output current divided by the capacitance.

==Characteristics==
In practice, the CW has a number of drawbacks. As the number of stages is increased, the voltages of the higher stages begin to "sag", primarily due to the [[electrical impedance]] of the capacitors in the lower stages. And, when supplying an output current, the voltage ripple rapidly increases as the number of stages is increased. For these reasons, CW multipliers with large number of stages are used only where relatively low output current is required. These effects can be partially compensated by increasing the capacitance in the lower stages, by increasing the frequency of the input power and by using an AC power source with a square or triangular waveform. By driving the CW from a high-frequency source, such as an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]], or a combination of an inverter and HV transformer, the overall physical size and weight of the CW power supply can be substantially reduced.

CW multipliers are typically used to develop higher voltages for relatively low-current applications, such as bias voltages ranging from tens or hundreds of volts to millions of volts for [[high-energy physics]] experiments or [[lightning]] safety testing. CW multipliers are also found, with a higher number of stages, in [[laser]] systems, high-voltage power supplies, [[X-ray]] systems, LCD [[backlight]]ing, [[traveling-wave tube]] amplifiers, [[Ion pump (physics)|ion pump]]s, [[electrostatic]] systems, [[air ioniser]]s, [[particle accelerator]]s, [[photocopier|copy machines]], scientific instrumentation, [[oscilloscope]]s, television sets and [[cathode ray tube]]s, [[electroshock weapon]]s, [[bug zapper]]s and many other applications that use high-voltage DC.

A similar circuit is the [[Marx generator]], which has the same "ladder" structure, but consists of resistors, capacitors and spark gaps. The Marx generator produces short pulses, whereas the CW generator produces a constant DC. Unlike the Cockcroft-Walton multiplier (generator), the Marx generator need air for the spark gaps and can not be immersed in oil as an insulator.

[[Image:12-6 Curveball.gif|thumb|200px|An animated diagram of a [[12–6 curveball]]]]
The '''curveball''' is a type of [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] in [[baseball]] thrown with a characteristic grip and hand movement that imparts forward spin to the [[baseball (object)|ball]], causing it to dive in a downward path as it approaches the plate. Varieties of curveballs include the [[12-6 curveball]] and the [[knuckle curve]]. Its close relatives are the [[slider]] and the [[slurve]]. The "curve" of the ball varies from pitcher to pitcher.

Outside the context of baseball, variants of the expression "to throw a curveball" essentially translate to introducing a significant deviation to a preceding concept.

==Grip and action==
The curveball is gripped much like a cup or drinking glass is held. The pitcher places the middle finger on and parallel to one of the long seams, and the thumb just behind the seam on the opposite side of the ball such that if looking from the top down, the hand should form a "C shape" with the horseshoe pointing in towards the palm following the contour of the thumb. The index finger is placed alongside the middle finger, and the other two extraneous fingers are folded in towards the palm with the knuckle of the ring finger touching the leather. Occasionally some pitchers will flare out these two fingers straight and away from the ball to keep them clear of the throwing motion. The curveball and slider share nearly identical grips and throwing motion.

The delivery of a curveball is entirely different from that of most other pitches. The pitcher at the top of the throwing arc will snap the arm and wrist in a downward motion. The ball first leaves contact with the thumb and tumbles over the index finger thus imparting the forward or "top-spin" characteristic of a curveball. The result is the exact opposite pitch of the [[four-seam fastball]]'s backspin, but with all four seams rotating in the direction of the flight path with forward-spin, with the [[axis of rotation]] perpendicular to the intended flight path much like a [[reel-type mower]] or a [[bowling ball]].

The amount of break on the ball depends on how hard the pitcher can snap the throw off, or how much forward spin can be put on the ball. The harder the snap, the more the pitch will break. Curveballs primarily break downwards, but can also break toward the pitcher's off hand to varying degrees. Unlike the fastball, the height of the ball's flight path arc does not necessarily need to occur at the pitcher's release point, and often peaks shortly afterwards. Curveballs are thrown with considerably less velocity than fastballs, because of both the unnatural delivery of the ball and the general rule that pitches thrown with less velocity will break more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/pdf/pitchingpage.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090324011336/http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/pdf/pitchingpage.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-03-24 |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical curveball in the major collegiate level and above will average between 65 and 80&amp;nbsp;mph, with the average [[MLB]] curve at 77&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efastball.com/baseball/pitching/grips/curve-ball-grip/ |title=Curve Ball Grip |publisher=Efastball.com |date=2009-07-26 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a hitter's perspective, the curveball will start in one location (usually high or at the top of the strike zone) and then dive rapidly as it approaches the plate. The most effective curveballs will start breaking at the height of the arc of the ball flight, and continue to break more and more rapidly as they approach and cross through the strike zone. A curveball that a pitcher fails to put enough spin on will not break much and is colloquially called a "hanging curve". Hanging curves are usually disastrous for a pitcher because the low velocity, non-breaking pitch is left high in the zone where hitters can wait on it and drive it for power.

The curveball is a popular and effective pitch in professional baseball, but it is not particularly widespread in leagues with players younger than college-level players. This is with regard for the safety of the pitcher – not because of its difficulty – though the pitch is widely considered difficult to learn as it requires some degree of mastery and the ability to pinpoint the thrown ball's location. There is generally greater chance of throwing [[wild pitch]]es when throwing the curveball.

When thrown correctly, it could have a break from seven to as much as 20&amp;nbsp;inches in comparison to the same pitcher's fastball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/blog_article/holy-mother-of-strasburg-with-pitch-f-x/ |title=Holy mother of Strasburg (with Pitch f/x!) |publisher=Hardballtimes.com |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
Due to the unnatural motion required to throw it, the curveball is considered a more advanced pitch and poses inherent risk of injury to a pitcher’s elbow and shoulder. There has been a controversy, as reported in the ''New York Times'', March 12, 2012, about whether curveballs alone are responsible for injuries in young pitchers or whether it is the number of pitches thrown that are the predisposing factor.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/sports/baseball/debate-grows-over-how-to-protect-young-pitching-arms.html|title=Young Arms and Curveballs: A Scientific Twist|author=Bill Pennington|work=The New York Times|date=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, allowing time for the [[cartilage]] and [[tendon]]s of the arm to fully develop would protect against injuries. While acquisition of proper form might be protective, Dr. James Andrews is quoted in the article as stating that in many children, insufficient neuromuscular control, lack of proper mechanics, and fatigue make maintenance of proper form unlikely.

The parts of the arm most commonly injured by the curveball are the [[ligament]]s in the elbow, the [[biceps]], and the forearm muscles.&lt;ref name=thurston&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.baseball-articles.com/teachcurve.html|title=Age to Teach the Curve Ball and How to Teach It|author=Bill Thurston|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major elbow injury requires repair through elbow ligament reconstruction, or [[Tommy John surgery]].

==The 12–6 curveball vs. the "slurve"==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Curveballs have a variety of trajectories and breaks among pitchers. This chiefly has to do with the arm slot and release point of a given pitcher, which is in turn governed by how comfortable the pitcher is throwing the overhand curveball.

Pitchers who can throw a curveball completely over handed with the arm slot more or less vertical will have a curveball that will break straight downwards. This is called a [[12–6 curveball]] as the break of the pitch is on a straight path downwards like the hands of a clock at 12 and 6. The [[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]] of a 12–6 curve is parallel with the level ground and perpendicular to its flight path.

Pitchers who throw their curveballs with the arm slot at an angle will throw a curveball that breaks down and toward the pitcher's off-hand. In the most extreme cases the curve will break very wide laterally. Because the slider and the curveball share nearly the same grip and have the same unique throwing motions, this curveball breaks much like a slider, and is colloquially termed a "[[slurve]]." The axis of rotation on a slurve will still be more or less perpendicular to the flight path of the ball; the latter however, will not be parallel to the ground. With some pitchers, the difference between curveball and other pitches such as slider and slurve, may be difficult to detect or even describe. A less common term for this type of curveball is a 1-7 or 2-8  curve.

==Physics==
Generally the [[Magnus effect]] describes the laws of physics that make a curveball curve. A fastball travels through the air with backspin, which creates a higher pressure zone in the air ahead of and under the baseball. The baseball's raised seams augment the ball's ability to develop a [[boundary layer]] and therefore a greater differential of pressure between the upper and lower zones. The effect of [[gravity]] is partially counteracted as the ball rides on and into increased pressure. Thus the fastball falls less than a ball thrown without spin (neglecting [[knuckleball]] effects) during the 60&amp;nbsp;feet 6&amp;nbsp;inches it travels to home plate.

On the other hand, a curveball, thrown with [[topspin]], creates a higher pressure zone on top of the ball, which deflects the ball downward in flight. Instead of counteracting gravity, the curveball adds additional downward force, thereby gives the ball an exaggerated drop in flight.

==Real or illusion?==
There was once a debate on whether a curveball actually curves or is an [[optical illusion]]. In 1949, Ralph B. Lightfoot, an aeronautical engineer at [[Sikorsky Aircraft]], used wind tunnel tests to prove that a curveball does in fact actually curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phschool.com/science/science_news/articles/pitching_science.html |title=Pitching Science – Engineers who track baseballs catch insights into the game |publisher=Phschool.com |date=2001-06-09 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On whether a curveball is caused by an illusion, [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Dizzy Dean]] has been quoted in a number of variations on this basic premise: "Stand behind a tree 60&amp;nbsp;feet away, and I will whomp you with an optical illusion!"

However, optical illusion caused by the ball's spinning may play an important part in what makes curveballs difficult to hit. The curveball's trajectory is smooth, however the batter perceives a sudden, dramatic change in the ball's direction. When an object that is spinning and moving through space is viewed directly, the overall motion is interpreted correctly by the brain. However, as it enters the peripheral vision, the internal spinning motion distorts how the overall motion is perceived. A curveball's trajectory begins in the center of the batter's vision, but overlaps with peripheral vision as it approaches the plate, which may explain the suddenness of the break perceived by the batter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=2009finalist |url=http://illusioncontest.neuralcorrelate.com/2009/the-break-of-the-curveball/ |title=2009 Vision Sciences Meeting: Curveball Demo Wins Illusion Contest |publisher=Illusioncontest.neuralcorrelate.com |date=2009-05-10 |accessdate=2010-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027064948/http://illusioncontest.neuralcorrelate.com/2009/the-break-of-the-curveball/ |archivedate=2010-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227114.300-revealed-why-curve-balls-are-so-hard-to-hit.html |title=Revealed: Why curveballs are so hard to hit |publisher=New Scientist |date=2009-06-07 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=https://www.wired.com/playbook/2010/10/curveball-illusion/ |title=Wired |publisher=Wired |date= 2010-10-19|accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uscnews.usc.edu/science_technology/breaking_curveball_too_good_to_be_true.html |title=Breaking Curveball Too Good to Be True – USC News |publisher=Uscnews.usc.edu |date=2010-10-13 |accessdate=2010-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023013800/http://uscnews.usc.edu/science_technology/breaking_curveball_too_good_to_be_true.html |archivedate=2010-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A peer-reviewed article on this hypothesis was published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Transitions between Central and Peripheral Vision Create Spatial/Temporal Distortions: A Hypothesis Concerning the Perceived Break of the Curveball |journal=Plosone.org/ |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=e13296 |date=2010-10-13 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013296|pmid=20967247 |pmc=2954145 |last1 = Shapiro|first1 = Arthur|last2=Lu |first2=Zhong-Lin |last3=Huang |first3=Chang-Bing |last4=Knight |first4=Emily |last5=Ennis |first5=Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicknames==
Popular nicknames for the curveball include "the bender" and "the hook" (both describing the trajectory of the pitch), "Uncle Charlie", "Lord Charles", "the yellow hammer", and "the yakker".

Baseball lore has it that the curveball was invented in the early 1870s by  [[Candy Cummings]] (it is debatable). An early demonstration of the "skewball" or curveball occurred at the [[Capitoline Grounds]] in Brooklyn in August 1870 by [[Fred Goldsmith (baseball)|Fred Goldsmith]]. In 1869, a reporter for the ''[[New York Clipper]]'' described [[Phonney Martin]] as an "extremely hard pitcher to hit for the ball never comes in a straight line‚ but in a tantalizing curve." If the observation is true, this would pre-date Cummings and Goldsmith.&lt;ref name="1869chrono"&gt;{{cite web |title=Charlton's Baseball Chronology – 1869 |website=baseballlibrary.com |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1869 |accessdate=2008-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211104100/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1869 |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, the first known collegiate baseball player to perfect the curveball was [[Clarence Emir Allen]] of Western Reserve College, now known as [[Case Western Reserve University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CdyMqAs9Cm4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Clarence+Emir+Allen%22+baseball#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Clarence+Emir+Allen%22+baseball&amp;f=false|title=Base Ball on the Western Reserve: The Early Game in Cleveland and Northeast Ohio, Year by Year and Town by Town, 1865-1900|first=James M.

It told of how a boy pitcher mastered the curveball to defeat the opposing batters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBEbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA924|title=St. Nicholas|author=|date=9 May 1885|publisher=Scribner &amp; Company|accessdate=9 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the sport, use of the curveball was thought to be dishonest and was outlawed,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} but officials could not do much to stop pitchers from using it.

Records of the [[Princeton University]] (then the College of New Jersey) game from September 26, 1863 in the [[New York Clipper]] of the Nassaus facing the Athletics refer to F. P. Henry, Princeton Class of 1866, "slow pitching with a great twist to the ball achieved a victory over fast pitching."  By 1866, many Princeton players were pitching and hitting "curved balls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTUCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Athletics at Princeton: A History|first1=Frank|last1=Presbrey|first2=James Hugh|last2=Moffatt|date=9 May 2018|publisher=Frank Presbrey Company|accessdate=9 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University|Harvard]] President [[Charles William Eliot|Charles Eliot]] was among those opposed to the curve, claiming it was a dishonest practice that Harvard students should not want to partake in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/eliot-house/|title=A look inside: Eliot House|website=[[Harvard Gazette]] |accessdate=14 October 2015|date=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/11/7/throwback-thursday-baseball/|title=Throwback Thursday |website=[[Harvard Crimson]]  | author=Kiara F.

In the past, major league pitchers [[Bob Feller]], [[Virgil Trucks]], [[Herb Score]], [[Camilo Pascual]] and [[Sandy Koufax]] were regarded as having outstanding curveballs. Other notable curveball pitchers since 1900 are/were [[Barry Zito]], [[Kerry Wood]], [[Adam Wainwright]], [[Dwight Gooden]], [[Nolan Ryan]], [[David Wells]], [[Darryl Kile]], [[Clayton Kershaw]], [[Orel Hershiser]], [[Bert Blyleven]], [[Yu Darvish]], [[Justin Verlander]],  [[Steve Carlton]], [[Mordecai Brown]], [[Seth Lugo]], and [[Lance McCullers Jr.]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2212">In [[chemistry]], a '''derivative''' is a [[Chemical compound|compound]] that is [[wikt:derive#Verb|derived]] from a similar compound by a [[chemical reaction]].

In the past, derivative also meant a compound that ''can be imagined to'' arise from another compound, if one [[atom]] or [[functional group|group of atoms]] is replaced with another atom or group of atoms,&lt;ref name=chemicool&gt;{{cite web
 |title = Definition of Derivative
 |publisher = Chemicool
 |date = 2007-09-18
 |url = http://www.chemicool.com/definition/derivative.html
 |accessdate = 2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but modern chemical language now uses the term [[structural analog]] for this meaning, thus eliminating ambiguity.{{Citation needed|reason=Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry – IUPAC Recommendations and Preferred Names 2013 still uses “derivative” and does not use “structural analogue”.|date=December 2016}} The term "structural analogue" is common in [[organic chemistry]].

In [[biochemistry]], the word is used for compounds that at least theoretically can be formed from the [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] compound.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite book
 |title = Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
 |publisher = Oxford University Press
 |isbn = 0-19-850673-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical derivatives may be used to facilitate analysis. For example, [[melting point]] (MP) analysis can assist in identification of many organic compounds. A crystalline derivative may be prepared, such as a [[semicarbazone]] or [[2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone]] (derived from [[aldehyde]]s or [[ketone]]s), as a simple way of verifying the identity of the original compound, assuming that a table of derivative MP values is available.&lt;ref name=Williamson&gt;{{cite book

'''East Base''' on [[Stonington Island]] is the oldest American research station in [[Antarctica]], having been commissioned by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1939. The station was built as part of two US wintering expeditions – [[United States Antarctic Service Expedition]] (1939–1941) and [[Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition]] (1947–1948). The base covers {{convert|1000|m}} from north to south and {{convert|500|m}} from east to west. The base was accorded the status of one of the [[Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica]] on 7 May 2004.&lt;ref name="ATS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.aq/devPH/apa/ep_protected_detail.aspx?type=1&amp;id=130&amp;lang=e |title=HSM 55: East Base |publisher= [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]] |accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ATS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.aq/devAS/info_measures_listitem.aspx?lang=e&amp;id=181 |title=Recommendation ATCM XV-12 (Paris, 1989) |publisher= [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]] |accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/east-base |title=East Base |publisher=[[Atlas Obscura]] |accessdate=12 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213001210/http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/east-base |archivedate=13 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First expedition==
The [[United States Antarctic Service Expedition|Antarctic Service Expedition]] was the first government-funded expedition of [[Richard E. Byrd|Admiral Richard E. Byrd]] (his first two expeditions in 1928–1930 and 1933–1935 were privately funded). East Base was built using Army knockdown buildings and a crew of 23 led by Richard Black, after Admiral Byrd had to return to Washington on the [[USS Bear (1874)|USS ''Bear'']]. The war time pressures and pack-ice in the bay which prevented ship movement led to the evacuation of the base in 1941 by air.&lt;ref name="PA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmerstation.com/history/8595/eastbasecrm.pdf |title=CRM at East Base, Antarctica – Palmer Station |publisher=[[Palmer Station]] |accessdate=12 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226181634/http://www.palmerstation.com/history/8595/eastbasecrm.pdf |archivedate=26 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second expedition and subsequent decline==
A private expedition led by [[Finn Ronne]] (second in command in the 1941 expedition) in 1947 ended with the participants' evacuation in 1948. The expedition crew included [[Jackie Ronne]] and [[Jennie Darlington]], who became the first women to spend a winter in Antarctica.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The base and all its equipment have since not been utilized, even though the [[British Antarctic Survey]] developed Base E in the vicinity of East Base.

The '''Electrical Trades Union''' (ETU) was a [[trade union]] representing electricians in the [[United Kingdom]], much of its membership consisting of wiring fitters and telephone engineers.

==Early history==
The union was founded in 1889 with the merger of the Union of Electrical Operatives, a [[London]]-based union formed in 1868, and the Amalgamated Society of Telegraph and Telephone Construction Men, based in [[Manchester]].  Initially, the union had 570 members,&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, ''Historical Directory of British Trade Unions'', vol.2, pp.33-34&lt;/ref&gt; most of whom were employees of the [[National Telephone Company]].  Its first part-time secretary, elected at the inaugural conference in 1890, was Dick Steadman.&lt;ref name="lloyd"&gt;{{cite book|title=Light &amp; liberty : a history of the EETPU|first=John |last=Lloyd|location=London|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|year=1990|isbn=0-297-79662-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Telephone Company's [[Brighton]] office was known for poor working conditions and, in 1891, an ETU branch was formed there, led by [[Alfred Ewer]].  After failed negotiations, the union began a strike, but this collapsed after five weeks.  The remaining strikers were sacked, although the union helped them find them work elsewhere.  In response, the union decided to appoint its first full-time general secretary; [[Arthur Walker (trade unionist)|Arthur Walker]] was elected unopposed.  He raised concerns that the union was unable to meet its commitments to out-of-work benefits to members.  The became an immediate problem with a downturn in trade the following year; union membership peaked at 1,183 that year but then began to fall.  The executive decided to institute a levy of three pennies per member per week in order to make up a shortfall, but this just led to more members leaving, and membership fell to only 402 in 1894.  Walker was forced to resign after stealing union funds, and Steadman replaced him on a temporary basis.&lt;ref name="lloyd" /&gt;

Steadman was unable to solve the union's problems, and membership reached an all-time low of 236 members at the end of 1895.  [[Francis Sims]] was elected as a full-time general secretary, in a final attempt to turn its fortunes around.  He undertook a tour of the UK, attempting to form new branches and strengthen existing ones.  While this produced mixed results, membership began to recover, and a successful strike in Bolton in 1899, and an agreement signed with [[Sheffield Town Council]] in 1900 further improved his reputation.  However, the following year, he too was found to have embezzled union funds, leading to his imprisonment for six months.  On release, he tried to set up a breakaway union, the Electrical Wiremen's Union, but this failed to grow and was disbanded in 1903.&lt;ref name="lloyd" /&gt;

[[Alfred Ewer]] was elected as Sims' replacement, and the union joined the [[Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;  Ewer's time in office was marked by conflict between the London-based executive and the provincial branches, culminating in a vote in 1907 to move the head office to Manchester.  He disappeared in May 1907, and was later found to have emigrated to Australia without informing his wife or friends, having stolen £144 of union funds.&lt;ref name="lloyd" /&gt;

==Growth under Rowan==
[[Jimmy Rowan]], the union's national organiser, was elected as Ewer's replacement, and he ultimately served until 1941.  He and oversaw rapid growth in the union; from 1,500 members in 1907, it grew to more than 80,000 on his retirement.&lt;ref name="lloyd" /&gt;

In 1918, the union balloted its members on joining the new [[Amalgamated Engineering Union]], but this was not approved.&lt;ref name="aeu"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jefferys |first1=James B. |title=The Story of the Engineers |date=1970 |publisher=Reprints in Social and Economic History |location=Edinburgh |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The early 1920s proved a difficult time for the union, and Rowan negotiated a merger with the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]], but this too was rejected by the membership.&lt;ref name="lloyd" /&gt;  [[Walter Citrine]] was appointed as an assistant general secretary of the union in 1920, and transformed its finances, making the reputation which led to his later appointment as [[General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress]].&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;

==Communism and anti-communism==
Rowan was known for his anti-communism but, despite this, members of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) became prominent in the union under his leadership; by the 1950s, both General Secretary and General President were CPGB members.&lt;ref name="lloyd" /&gt;

In June 1961, the ETU was taken to court for "conspiracy to defraud" by the union leadership.

After its leader Jock Byrne suffered a [[stroke]], [[Frank Chapple]] became the union's leader in 1966. Unusually for a union leader at the time,Chapple espoused [[Free market|free-market]] thinking, and he aimed to rid his union of [[communist]]s; his former union - the ETU had been run by communists. He was a "reluctant loyalist" to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2009}} The union went on to advocate [[nuclear power]], [[privatisation]] of state-owned industries and membership of the [[European Union]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Merger==
In July 1968, the ETU merged with the [[Plumbing Trades Union]] to form the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union]].&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;

The '''environmental impact of [[nuclear power]]''' results from the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], operation, and the effects of [[nuclear accidents]].

The [[greenhouse gas emission]]s from nuclear fission power are much smaller than those associated with coal, oil and gas, and the routine health risks are much smaller than those associated with coal. However, there is a "catastrophic risk" potential if containment fails,&lt;ref name="ipfm2010" /&gt; which in nuclear reactors can be brought about by overheated fuels melting and releasing large quantities of fission products into the environment. This potential risk could wipe out the benefits. The most long-lived radioactive wastes, including spent nuclear fuel, must be contained and isolated from the environment for a long period of time. On the other side, spent nuclear fuel could be reused, yielding even more energy, and reducing the amount of waste to be contained. The public has been made sensitive to these risks and there has been considerable [[Anti-nuclear movement|public opposition to nuclear power]].

The 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] and 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]], along with high construction costs, also compounded by delays resulting from a steady schedule of demonstrations, injunctions and political actions, caused by the anti-nuclear opposition, ended the rapid growth of global nuclear power capacity.&lt;ref name=ipfm2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fissilematerials.org/library/rr09.pdf |title=The Uncertain Future of Nuclear Energy |author=International Panel on Fissile Materials |date = September 2010|work=Research Report 9 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A release of radioactive materials followed the 2011 Japanese tsunami which damaged the [[Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]], resulting in [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|hydrogen gas explosions and partial meltdowns]] classified as a [[International Nuclear Event Scale|Level 7]] event. The large-scale release of radioactivity resulted in people being evacuated from a 20&amp;nbsp;km exclusion zone set up around the power plant, similar to the 30&amp;nbsp;km radius [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] still in effect. But published works suggest that the radioactivity levels have lowered enough to now have only a limited impact on wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:WIPP-04.jpeg|thumb|right|Technicians emplacing [[transuranic waste]] at the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]], near [[Carlsbad, New Mexico]]. Various mishaps at the plant in 2014 brought focus to the problem of what to do with a mounting stockpile of spent fuel, from commercial nuclear reactors, currently stored at individual reactor sites. In 2010, the [[USDOE]] mothballed plans to develop the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/us-seeks-waste-research-revival-1.14804 |title=US seeks waste-research revival: Radioactive leak brings nuclear repositories into the spotlight |volume=507 |issue=7490 |pages=15–16 |author=Jeff Tollefson |date=4 March 2014 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/507015a |pmid=24598616 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The spent nuclear fuel from  [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium-239]] nuclear fission contains a wide variety of [[carcinogen]]ic [[radionuclide]] [[isotope]]s such as [[strontium-90]], [[iodine-131]] and [[caesium-137]], and includes some of the most long-lived [[Transuranium element|transuranic elements]] such as [[americium-241]] and isotopes of [[plutonium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Department of Energy Carlsbad Field Office | title = Final Environmental Assessment for Actinide Chemistry and Repository Science Laboratory.

Disposal of these wastes in engineered facilities, or repositories, located deep underground in suitable geologic formations is seen as the reference solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.fr/html/rwm/reports/2008/nea6433-statement.pdf NEA – Moving forward with geological disposal]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Panel on Fissile Materials]] has said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is widely accepted  that spent nuclear fuel and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for long periods of time, to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment. Safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use. There is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface.&lt;ref name=har&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/managing-nuclear-spent-fuel-policy-lessons-10-country-study |title=Managing nuclear spent fuel: Policy lessons from a 10-country study |author=Harold Feiveson, Zia Mian, [[M.V. Ramana]], and [[Frank von Hippel]]  |date=27 June 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Common elements of repositories include the radioactive waste, the containers enclosing the waste, other engineered barriers or seals around the containers, the tunnels housing the containers, and the geologic makeup of the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=USDOE&gt;[http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/factsheets/doeymp0405.shtml US DOE – Radioactive waste: an international concern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924002031/http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/factsheets/doeymp0405.shtml |date=2006-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of natural geologic barriers to isolate radioactive waste is demonstrated by the [[natural nuclear fission reactor]]s at [[Oklo]], Africa. During their long reaction period about 5.4 tonnes of fission products as well as 1.5 tonnes of [[plutonium]] together with other [[transuranic elements]] were generated in the uranium ore body. This plutonium and the other transuranics remained immobile until the present day, a span of almost 2 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;R. Naudet. 1976. ''The Oklos nuclear reactors: 1800 millions years ago''. Interdisciplinary Science Reviews, 1(1) p.72-84.&lt;/ref&gt; This is quite remarkable in view of the fact that [[ground water]] had ready access to the deposits and they were not in a chemically inert form, such as glass.

Despite a long-standing agreement among many experts that geological disposal can be safe, technologically feasible and environmentally sound, a large part of the general public in many countries remains skeptical.&lt;ref name = vandenbosch&gt;Vandenbosch, Robert, and Susanne E. Vandenbosch. 2007. ''Nuclear waste stalemate''. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the challenges facing the supporters of these efforts is to demonstrate confidently that a repository will contain wastes for so long that any releases that might take place in the future will pose no significant health or [[Natural environment|environmental]] risk.

[[Nuclear reprocessing]] does not eliminate the need for a repository, but reduces the volume, reduces the long term radiation hazard, and long term heat dissipation capacity needed. Reprocessing does not eliminate the political and community challenges to repository siting.&lt;ref name=har/&gt;

The countries that have made the most progress towards a repository for high-level radioactive waste have typically started with [[public consultation]]s and made voluntary siting a necessary condition. This consensus seeking approach is believed to have a greater chance of success than top-down modes of decision making, but the process is necessarily slow, and there is "inadequate experience around the world to know if it will succeed in all existing and aspiring nuclear nations".&lt;ref&gt;[[M.V. Ramana]]. Nuclear Power: Economic, Safety, Health, and Environmental Issues of Near-Term Technologies, ''Annual Review of Environment and Resources'', 2009, 34, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[NIMBY|most communities do not want to host]] a nuclear waste repository as they are "concerned about their community becoming a de facto site for waste for thousands of years, the health and environmental consequences of an accident, and lower property values".&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', World Scientific, p. 144; See also ''[[Nuclear Nebraska]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 Presidential Memorandum, U.S. President Obama established the "Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future".&lt;ref name="About the Commission"&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Commission |url= http://www.brc.gov/index.php?q=page/about-commission |accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission, composed of fifteen members, conducted an extensive two-year study of nuclear waste disposal.&lt;ref name="About the Commission"/&gt;  During their research the Commission visited Finland, France, Japan, Russia, Sweden, and the UK, and in 2012, the Commission submitted its final report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Please Note |url= http://www.brc.gov |accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission did not issue recommendations for a specific site but rather presented a comprehensive recommendation for disposal strategies.&lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"&gt;{{cite web |title= Disposal Subcommittee Report to the Full Commission |author= Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future |url= http://www.brc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/disposal_report_updated_final.pdf |accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In their final report the Commission put forth seven recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue. A major recommendation was that "the United States should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste".&lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"/&gt;

=== Other waste ===

Moderate amounts of low-level waste are through chemical and volume control system (CVCS). This includes gas, liquid, and solid waste produced through the process of purifying the water through evaporation. Liquid waste is reprocessed continuously, and gas waste is filtered, compressed, stored to allow decay, diluted, and then discharged. The rate at which this is allowed is regulated and studies must prove that such discharge does not violate dose limits to a member of the public (see [[#Radioactive gases and effluents|radioactive effluent emissions]]).

Solid waste can be disposed of simply by placing it where it will not be disturbed for a few years.  There are three low-level waste disposal sites in the United States in South Carolina, Utah, and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;NRC. [https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/brochures/br0216/ Radioactive Waste: Production, Storage, Disposal (NUREG/BR-0216, Rev. 2)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Solid waste from the CVCS is combined with solid radwaste that comes from handling materials before it is buried off-site.&lt;ref&gt;NRC. [https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/teachers/10.pdf Radioactive Waste Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States environmental groups have said that uranium mining companies are attempting to avoid cleanup costs at disused uranium mine sites. Environmental remediation is required by many states after a mine becomes inactive. Environmental groups have filed legal objections to prevent mining companies from avoiding compulsory cleanups.  Uranium mining companies have skirted the cleanup laws by reactivating their mine sites briefly from time-to-time. Letting the mines sites stay contaminated over decades increases the potential risk of radioactive contamination leeching into the ground according to one environmental group, the Information Network for Responsible Mining, which started legal proceedings about March 2013. Among the corporations holding mining companies with such rarely used mines is [[General Atomics]].&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes-2013.04.16"&gt;Frosch, Dan.

A15 in the New York edition. Published online April 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power plant emission ==

=== Radioactive gases and effluents ===
[[Image:Kernkraftwerk Grafenrheinfeld - 2013.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Grafenrheinfeld Nuclear Power Plant]].  The tallest structure is the chimney that releases effluent gases.]]

Most commercial nuclear power plants release gaseous and liquid radiological effluents into the environment as a byproduct of the Chemical Volume Control System, which are monitored in the US by the EPA and the NRC. Civilians living within {{convert|50|mi|km}} of a nuclear power plant typically receive about 0.1&amp;nbsp;[[Sievert|μSv]] per year.&lt;ref name=dosechart&gt;[http://www.ans.org/pi/resources/dosechart/ ANS dosechart] [American Nuclear Society]&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the average person living at or above sea level receives at least 260&amp;nbsp;μSv from [[cosmic radiation]].&lt;ref name=dosechart/&gt;

All reactors in the United States are required by law to have a containment building.  The walls of containment buildings are several feet thick and made of concrete and therefore can stop the release of any radiation emitted by the reactor into the environment. If a person is to worry about an energy source that releases large amounts of radiation into the environment, they should worry about coal-fired plants. "The waste produced by coal plants is actually more radioactive than that generated by their nuclear counterparts. In fact, the fly ash emitted by a [coal] power plant—a by-product from burning coal for electricity—carries into the surrounding environment 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant producing the same amount of energy." Coal-fired plants are much more hazardous to people’s health than nuclear power plants as they release much more radioactive elements into the environment and subsequently expose people to greater levels of radiation than nuclear plants do. "Estimated radiation doses ingested by people living near the coal plants were equal to or higher than doses for people living around the nuclear facilities. At one extreme, the scientists estimated fly ash radiation in individuals' bones at around 18 millirems (thousandths of a rem, a unit for measuring doses of ionizing radiation) a year. Doses for the two nuclear plants, by contrast, ranged from between three and six millirems for the same period. And when all food was grown in the area, radiation doses were 50 to 200 percent higher around the coal plants."&lt;ref name="sciam-coalash"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hvistendahl|first1=Mara|title=Coal Ash Is More Radioactive Than Nuclear Waste|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=28 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total amount of radioactivity released through this method depends on the power plant, the regulatory requirements, and the plant's performance.  Atmospheric dispersion models combined with pathway models are employed to accurately approximate the dose to a member of the public from the effluents emitted. [[Airborne particulate radioactivity monitoring|Effluent monitoring]] is conducted continuously at the plant.

A leak of [[radioactive]] water at [[Vermont Yankee]] in 2010, along with similar incidents at more than 20 other US nuclear plants in recent years, has kindled doubts about the reliability, durability, and maintenance of aging nuclear installations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Daley. [http://www.boston.com/news/local/vermont/articles/2010/01/31/leaks_imperil_nuclear_industry/ Leaks imperil nuclear industry: Vermont Yankee among troubled] ''Boston Globe'', January 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tritium]] is a radioactive isotope of [[hydrogen]] that emits a low-energy beta particle and is usually measured in [[becquerel]]s (i.e. atoms decaying per second) per liter (Bq/L).  Tritium can be contained in water released from a nuclear plant.  The primary concern for tritium release is the presence in drinking water, in addition to biological magnification leading to tritium in crops and animals consumed for food.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]. [https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/grndwtr-contam-tritium.html Groundwater Contamination (Tritium) at Nuclear Plants].&lt;/ref&gt;

Tritium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/tritium.html EPA]&lt;/ref&gt; the mass 3 isotope of hydrogen is deliberately created for thermonuclear weapons use, at government-owned reactors like Watts Bar, by irradiating lithium 6 with neutrons to fission i1. Light water reactors, the standard kind in the USA, generate small quantities of deuterium by neutron capture in the water. This consumes enough neutrons that the natural uranium needs enrichment to raise its fissile U-235 content from 0.72% to 3.6% for Pressurised Water Reactors. Canada's CANDU design uses "heavy water", deuterium oxide, and can use un-enriched uranium because deuterium captures so very few of the neutrons. So the rate of production of tritium from the small amount of deuterium in US reactors must be quite low.
18 millilitres  (ml) of water contain Avogadro's number of molecules, by definition, which is just over 6 times the 23rd power of 10, in other words 600 thousand million million million. That gives some idea of how small a unit the Becquerel is. A Litre, of course, is a thousand ml.

Legal concentration limits have differed greatly from place to place (see table right).

Uranium mining is the process of extraction of [[uranium]] ore from the ground. The worldwide production of uranium in 2009 amounted to 50,572 [[tonne]]s. [[Kazakhstan]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]] are the top three producers and together account for 63% of world uranium production.&lt;ref name="WNA-WUM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf23.html|title=World Uranium Mining|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent use of uranium from mining is as fuel for [[nuclear power plant]]s. The mining and milling of uranium present significant dangers to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

"An average value for the thermal energy of coal is approximately 6150 kilowatt-hours(kWh)/ton. .... The thermal energy released in nuclear fission produces about 2 x 10E9 kWh/ton."

It follows that, for the same amount of energy, much less uranium needs to be mined than coal, cutting the environmental impacts of uranium mining on nuclear energy generation.

In 2010, 41% of the world's uranium production was produced by [[in-situ leaching]], which uses solutions to dissolve the uranium while leaving the rock in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/ENF-Continued_growth_in_uranium_production-0305114.html |title=Continued growth in uranium production |publisher=World-nuclear-news.org |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder was produced by conventional mining, in which the mined uranium ore is ground to a uniform particle size and then the uranium extracted by chemical leaching. The product is a powder of [[enriched uranium|unenriched]] uranium, "[[yellowcake]]," which is sold on the uranium market as U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. Uranium mining can use large amounts of water — for example, the [[Roxby Downs]] [[Olympic Dam, South Australia|Olympic Dam]] mine in South Australia uses 35,000&amp;nbsp;m³ of water each day and plans to increase this to 150,000&amp;nbsp;m³ per day.&lt;ref name="powerandwater"&gt;[http://www.sciencealert.com.au/opinions/20072910-16508.html Nuclear power and water scarcity], ScienceAlert, 28 October 2007, Retrieved 2008-08-08&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk of cancer===
{{See also|Nuclear power debate#Health effects on population near nuclear power plants and workers| Nuclear labor issues}}
Numerous studies have been done on possible effect of nuclear power in causing cancer. Such studies have looked for excess cancers in both plant workers and surrounding populations due to releases during normal operations of nuclear plants and other parts of the nuclear power industry, as well as excess cancers in workers and the public due to accidental releases. There is agreement that excess cancers in both plant workers and the surrounding public have been caused by accidental releases such as the Chernobyl accident.&lt;ref&gt;US National Cancer Institute, [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/nuclear-power-accidents Accidents at Nuclear Power Plants and Cancer Risk], 19 Apr. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also agreement that some workers in other parts of the nuclear fuel cycle, most notably uranium mining – at least in past decades – have had elevated rates of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pgms/worknotify/uranium.html Uranium miners], 13 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, numerous studies of possible cancers caused by nuclear power plants in normal operation have come to opposing conclusions, and the issue is a matter of scientific controversy and ongoing study.&lt;ref name="nrc.gov"&gt;US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, [https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/fs-analys-cancer-risk-study.html Fact Sheet on Analysis of Cancer Risk in Populations Near Nuclear Facilities—Phase 1 Feasibility Study], 29 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Ghirga, [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1824-7288-36-60#page-1 "Cancer in children residing near nuclear power plants: an open question"], Italian Journal of Pediatrics,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, [http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/resources/mythbusters/index.cfm Mythbusters], 3 Feb. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power reactor accidents can result in a variety of [[radioisotope]]s being released into the environment. The health impact of each radioisotope depends on a variety of factors. [[Iodine-131]] is potentially an important source of morbidity in accidental discharges because of its prevalence and because it settles on the ground. When iodine-131 is released, it can be inhaled or consumed after it enters the food chain, primarily through contaminated fruits, vegetables, milk, and groundwater. Iodine-131 in the body rapidly accumulates in the thyroid gland, becoming a source of [[beta radiation]].&lt;ref name=chris11&gt;{{cite journal |title=Short-Term and Long-Term Health Risks of Nuclear-Power-Plant Accidents |volume=364 |issue=24 |pages=2334–2341 |author=John P.

Production of nuclear power relies on the nuclear fuel cycle, which includes uranium mining and milling. Uranium workers are routinely exposed to low levels of [[radon]] decay products and [[gamma radiation]]. Risks of [[leukemia]] from acute and high doses of gamma radiation are well-known, but there is a debate about risks from lower doses. The risks of other [[hematological cancer]]s in uranium workers have been examined in very few studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Leukemis, lymphoma and multiple myeloma mortality |author=Lydia B.

===Comparison to coal-fired generation===

In terms of net radioactive release, the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP) estimated the average radioactivity per short ton of coal is 17,100 millicuries/4,000,000 tons.  With 154 coal plants in the United States, this amounts to emissions of 0.6319 TBq per year for a single plant.

In terms of dose to a human living nearby, it is sometimes cited that coal plants release 100 times the radioactivity of nuclear plants.  This comes from NCRP Reports No. 92 and No. 95 which estimated the dose to the population from 1000 MWe coal and nuclear plants at 4.9 [[Collective dose|man-Sv]]/year and 0.048 man-Sv/year respectively (a typical [[Chest x-ray]] gives a dose of about 0.06 mSv for comparison).&lt;ref name=ornl&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html Coal Combustion – ORNL Review Vol. 26, No. 3&amp;4, 1993&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205103749/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |date=February 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates an added dose of 0.3 µSv per year for living within {{convert|50|mi|km}} of a coal plant and 0.009 milli-rem for a nuclear plant for yearly radiation dose estimation.&lt;ref name=epac&gt;The EPA.

Unlike coal-fired or oil-fired generation, nuclear power generation does not directly produce any [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]], or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (pollution from fossil fuels is blamed for 24,000 early deaths each year in the U.S. alone&lt;ref name="catf-dada"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catf.us/publications/view/24|title=Dirty Air, Dirty Power: Mortality and Health Damage Due to Air Pollution from Power Plants|accessdate=2006-11-10|publisher=Clean Air Task Force|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  However, as with all energy sources, there is some pollution associated with support activities such as mining, manufacturing and transportation.

A major European Union-funded research study known as ExternE, or [[Externality|Externalities]] of Energy, undertaken over the period of 1995 to 2005 found that the environmental and health costs of nuclear power, per unit of energy delivered, was €0.0019/kWh. This is lower than that of many [[renewable]] sources including the environmental impact caused by [[biomass]] use and the manufacture of photovoltaic [[solar panels]], and was over thirty times lower than coals impact of €0.06/kWh, or 6 cents/kWh. However, the energy source of the lowest external costs associated with it was found to be [[wind power]] at €0.0009/kWh, which is an environmental and health impact just under half the price of Nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.externe.info/externe_2006/exterpols.html ExternE-Pol, External costs of current and advanced electricity systems, associated with emissions from the operation of power plants and with the rest of the energy chain, final technical report.] See figure 9, 9b and figure 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents argue that the problems of nuclear waste "do not come anywhere close" to approaching the problems of fossil fuel waste.&lt;ref&gt;

===Waste heat===
{{see also|Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources#Heat from thermal power plants}}
[[Image:North Anna NPP.jpg|thumb|right|The North Anna plant uses direct exchange cooling into an artificial lake.]]
As with all thermoelectric plants, nuclear power plants need cooling systems. The most common systems for thermal power plants, including nuclear, are:

* Once-through cooling, in which water is drawn from a large body, passes through the cooling system, and then flows back into the water body.
* Cooling pond, in which water is drawn from a pond dedicated to the purpose, passes through the cooling system, then returns to the pond. Examples include the [[South Texas Nuclear Generating Station]].The [[North Anna Nuclear Generating Station]] uses a cooling pond or artificial lake, which at the plant discharge canal is often about 30&amp;nbsp;°F warmer than in the other parts of the lake or in normal lakes (this is cited as an attraction of the area by some residents).&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/27/AR2007112702224.html Happy in Their Haven Beside the Nuclear Plant].&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental effects on the artificial lakes are often weighted in arguments against construction of new plants, and during droughts have drawn media attention.&lt;ref&gt;NBC. [http://www.nbc17.com/midatlantic/ncn/news.apx.-content-articles-NCN-2007-11-29-0033.html Dropping Lake Levels Affect Shearon Harris]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station]] is credited with helping the conservation status of the [[American Crocodile]], largely an effect of the waste heat produced.&lt;ref name="fpl-abouttp"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2007-07-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cooling towers, in which water recirculates through the cooling system until it evaporates from the tower. Examples include the [[Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant]].

A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory determined that the median nuclear plant with cooling towers consumed 672 gallons of water per megawatt-hour, less than the median consumption of concentrating solar power (865 gal/MWhr for trough type, and 786 gal/MWhr for power tower type), slightly less than coal (687 gal/MWhr), but more than that for natural gas (198 gal/MWhr). Once-through cooling systems use more water, but less water is lost to evaporation. In the median US nuclear plant with once-through cooling, 44,350 gal/MWhr passes through the cooling system, but only 269 gal/MWhr (less than 1 percent) is consumed by evaporation.&lt;ref name="nrel.gov"&gt;John Macknick and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies], National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear plants exchange 60 to 70% of their thermal energy by cycling with a body of water or by evaporating water through a [[cooling tower]]. This thermal efficiency is somewhat lower than that of coal-fired power plants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/cooling_power_plants_inf121.html Cooling power plants World Nuclear Association]&lt;/ref&gt; thus creating more [[waste heat]].

It is possible to use waste heat in [[cogeneration]] applications such as [[district heating]].  The principles of cogeneration and district heating with nuclear power are the same as any other form of [[thermal power station|thermal power production]]. One use of nuclear heat generation was with the [[Ågesta Nuclear Power Plant]] in Sweden. In Switzerland, the [[Beznau Nuclear Power Plant]] provides heat to about 20,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;SUGIYAMA KEN'ICHIRO (Hokkaido Univ.) et al. [http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200607/000020060706A0175205.php Nuclear District Heating: The Swiss Experience] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202140901/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200607/000020060706A0175205.php |date=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, district heating with nuclear power plants is less common than with other modes of waste heat generation: because of either [[zoning|siting regulations]] and/or the [[NIMBY]] effect, nuclear stations are generally not built in densely populated areas. Waste heat is more commonly used in industrial applications.&lt;ref&gt;[[IAEA]], 1997: [http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull392/39205082125.pdf Nuclear power applications: Supplying heat for homes and industries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709202753/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull392/39205082125.pdf |date=2010-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Europe's [[2003 European heat wave|2003]] and [[2006 European heat wave|2006 heat waves]], French, Spanish and German utilities had to secure exemptions from regulations in order to discharge overheated water into the environment. Some nuclear reactors shut down.&lt;ref&gt;The Observer. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1833620,00.html Heatwave shuts down nuclear power plants].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0810/p04s01-woeu.html |title=Nuclear power's green promise dulled by rising temps |journal=Christian Science Monitor |author=Susan Sachs |date=2006-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Water consumption and risks==
During the process of nuclear power generation, large volumes of water are used. The uranium fuel inside reactors undergoes induced nuclear fission which releases great amounts of energy that is used to heat water. The water turns into steam and rotates a turbine, creating electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall|first=Brian|title=How Nuclear Power Works|url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-power.htm|work=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=30 March 2014|author2=Robert Lamb|date=9 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear plants must collect around 600 gallons/MWh for this process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Western Resource Advocates|title=Water Use for Energy|url=http://www.westernresourceadvocates.org/water/waterenergy.php|work=Western Resource Advocates|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the plants are built near bodies of water.

A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that nuclear plants with cooling towers consumed 672 gal/MWhr. The water consumption intensity for nuclear was similar to that for coal electricity (687 gal/MWhr), lower than the consumption rates for concentrating solar power (865 gal/MWhr for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWhr for CSP tower), and higher than that of electricity generated by natural gas (198 gal/MWhr).&lt;ref name="nrel.gov"/&gt;

When intaking water for cooling, nuclear plants, like all [[thermal power plants]] including coal, [[geothermal]] and [[biomass power plant]]s, use special structures. Water is often drawn through screens to minimise to entry of debris. The problem is that many aquatic organisms are trapped and killed against the screens, through a process known as impingement. Aquatic organisms small enough to pass through the screens are subject to toxic stress in a process known as entrainment. Billions of marine organisms, such as fish, seals, shellfish, and turtles, essential to the food chain, are sucked into the cooling systems and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunter|first=Linda|author2=Paul Gunter |author3=Scott Cullen |author4=Nancy Burton |title=Licensed To Kill|year=2001|url=http://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/licensedtokill/LiscencedtoKill.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]], p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2014}}

== Greenhouse gas emissions ==
{{main|Comparisons of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions}}
[[File:Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Electricity Production IEA.PNG|thumb|right|"Hydropower-Internalised Costs and Externalised Benefits"; Frans H. Koch; [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA)-Implementing Agreement for Hydropower Technologies and Programmes; 2000. It depicts the [[emission intensity]] of various energy sources over their [[life cycle assessment|total life cycle]]. The [[intergovernmental panel on climate change]](IPCC) routinely assesses the most common energy sources life cycle [[emission intensity]] and found [[Comparisons of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions|similar emissions from wind energy as nuclear in 2014]].]]

Many stages of the [[nuclear fuel chain]] — mining, milling, transport, fuel fabrication, enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning and waste management — use fossil fuels, or involve changes to land use, and hence emit carbon dioxide and conventional pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Kleiner. [http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0810/pdf/climate.2008.99.pdf Nuclear energy: assessing the emissions] ''Nature Reports'', Vol. 2, October 2008, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', University of New South Wales Press, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=markd&gt;Mark Diesendorf. [http://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/content/userDocs/NukesSocialAlternativesMD.pdf Is nuclear energy a possible solution to global warming?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722213838/http://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/content/userDocs/NukesSocialAlternativesMD.pdf |date=July 22, 2012 }} pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nuclear energy contributes a very small amount of emissions into the atmosphere which can cause many environmental problems such as global warming. Uranium is not burned in a nuclear power plant as coal is so there are no emissions from it.  All of the waste that comes from the fission of uranium stays in the plant and is therefore able to be disposed of in a safe way in which the uranium is kept out of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;The Franklin Institute Science Museum 2014&lt;/ref&gt; “About 73 percent of emissions-free electricity in the United States comes from nuclear plants.”  Nuclear energy produces far less carbon dioxide than coal, 9 grams per kilowatt hour compared with 790–1017 grams per kilowatt hour for coal.  Also, nuclear energy produces the same amount if not less greenhouse gasses than renewable resources.
Like all energy sources, various [[life cycle analysis]] (LCA) studies have led to a range of estimates on the [[median]] value for nuclear power, with most comparisons of carbon dioxide emissions show [[nuclear power]] as comparable to [[renewable energy]] sources.&lt;ref name=koch&gt;"Hydropower-Internalised Costs and Externalised Benefits"; Frans H. Koch; [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA)-Implementing Agreement for Hydropower Technologies and Programmes; 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=briten&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-energy.com/opendocument.php?did=341|title=Environmental Product Declaration of Electricity from Torness Nuclear Power Station|author=AEA Technology environment|date=May 2005|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To better quantify and compare greenhouse gas emissions reported by researchers using many different assumptions and techniques, the US [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] is sponsoring meta-analysis studies using harmonization, in which reported life-cycle emissions are adjusted to consistent assumptions. The results commonly narrow the range of carbon emissions for a given energy source.&lt;ref&gt;US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, [http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lcah.html Life cycle assessment harmonization], 17 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting 2012 study published in the ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'' analyzing CO2 [[life cycle assessment]] emissions from [[nuclear power]] determined that "the collective LCA literature indicates that life cycle GHG emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies".&lt;ref&gt;Ethan S. Warner, Garvin A. Heath. Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Nuclear Electricity Generation, Journal of Industrial Ecology, Vol. 16, Issue Supplement S1, pp. S73–S92, April 2012. Article first published online: April 17, 2012, {{DOI|10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00472.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also said that for the most common category of reactors, the [[light water reactor]] (LWR): "Harmonization decreased the [[median]] estimate for all LWR technology categories so that the [[median]]s of [[BWR]]s, [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]]s, and all LWRs are similar, at approximately 12 g CO2-eq/kWh".&lt;ref&gt;US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, [http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_nuclear.html Nuclear power results – life cycle assessment harmonization], 17 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this data in hand, therefore historically, nuclear power, primarily from ~1970 to 2013,  is estimated to have prevented the atmospheric emission of 64 [[gigatonne]]s of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|CO2-equivalent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es3051197 | pmid=23495839 | volume=47 | issue=9 | title=Prevented Mortality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Historical and Projected Nuclear Power | journal=Environmental Science | pages=4889–4895 | last1 = Kharecha | first1 = Pushker A.| year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators have argued that an expansion of nuclear power would help combat [[climate change]]. Others have argued that it is one way to reduce emissions, but it comes with its own problems, such as risks related to severe [[nuclear accident]]s, war attacks on nuclear sites, nuclear terrorism and currently no generally accepted solution for the disposal of [[radioactive waste]] which needs to be heavily guarded for hundreds of thousands of years.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} These advocates also believe that there are better ways of dealing with climate change than investing in nuclear power, including the improved [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and greater reliance on decentralized and [[renewable energy]] sources.&lt;ref name=mvr&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ramana | first1 = M.V. | year = 2009 | title = Nuclear Power: Economic, Safety, Health, and Environmental Issues of Near-Term Technologies | url = | journal = Annual Review of Environment and Resources | volume = 34 | issue = | page = 143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also some uncertainty surrounding the future [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions of nuclear power, which has to do with the potential for a declining uranium ore grade without a corresponding increase in the [[Enriched uranium|efficiency of enrichment methods]]. In a scenario analysis of future global nuclear development, as it could be effected by a decreasing global [[uranium market]] of average ore grade, the analysis determined that depending on conditions, median life cycle nuclear power GHG emissions could be between 9 and 110 g CO2-eq/kWh by 2050, with the latter figure regarded as an unrealistic "worst-case scenario" by the authors of the study.&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Warner | first1 = E.

Although this future analyses deals with extrapolations for present [[Generation II reactor]] technology, the same paper also summarizes the literature on "FBRs"/[[Fast Breeder Reactor]]s, of which two are in operation as of 2014 with the newest being the [[BN-800 reactor|BN-800]], for these reactors it states that the "median life cycle GHG emissions&amp;nbsp;... [are] similar to or lower than [present] [[LWR]]s and purports to consume little or no uranium ore.''&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE"/&gt;

Concerns about the possibility of a large-scale release of radioactivity resulted in 20&amp;nbsp;km exclusion zone being set up around the power plant and people within the 20–30&amp;nbsp;km zone being advised to stay indoors.

In the second half of August 2011, Japanese lawmakers announced that [[Naoto Kan|Prime Minister Naoto Kan]] would likely visit the Fukushima Prefecture to announce that the large contaminated area around the destroyed reactors would be declared uninhabitable, perhaps for decades. Some of the areas in the temporary {{convert|12|mi|km}} radius evacuation zone around Fukushima were found to be heavily contaminated with radionuclides according to a new survey released by the Japanese [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Science and Education]]. The town of [[Ōkuma, Fukushima|Okuma]] was reported as being over 25 times above the safe limit of 20 [[sievert|millisieverts]] per year.&lt;ref name="NYT-2011.08.21"&gt;Fackler, Martin.

Instead, 5 years later, the government expects to gradually lift the designation of some “difficult-to-return- zones”, a total {{convert|337|km2|sqmi}} area, from around 2021.

As of 2013 the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] in the [[Ukraine]] was and remains the world's worst nuclear power plant disaster. Estimates of its death toll are controversial and range from 62 to 25,000, with the high projections including deaths that have yet to happen. Peer reviewed publications have generally supported a projected total figure in the low tens of thousands; for example an estimate of 16,000 excess cancer deaths are predicted to occur due to the Chernobyl accident out to the year 2065, whereas, in the same period, several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes (from [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] published in the ''[[International Journal of Cancer]]'' in 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Cardis, Elisabeth, et al., ''[[International Journal of Cancer]]'', Vol. 119, Iss. 6, pp. 1224–1235, September 15, 2006. Published online: April 20, 2006, {{DOI|10.1002/ijc.22037}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IARC also released a press release stating "To put it in perspective, tobacco smoking will cause several thousand times more cancers in the same population", but also, referring to the numbers of different types of cancers, "The exception is [[thyroid cancer]], which, over ten years ago, was already shown to be increased in the most contaminated regions around the site of the accident".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2006/pr168.html Press Release N° 168: The Cancer Burden from Chernobyl in Europe], Lyon Cedex, France: [[World Health Organization]], [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], April 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The full version of the [[World Health Organization]] health effects report adopted by the [[United Nations]], also published in 2006, included the prediction of, in total, no more of 4,000 deaths from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Peplow, Mark.

Large amounts of [[radioactive contamination]] were spread across Europe due to the Chernobyl disaster, and [[cesium]] and [[strontium]] contaminated many agricultural products, livestock and soil. The accident necessitated the [[Chernobyl disaster#Evacuation developments|evacuation of the entire city of Pripyat]] and of 300,000 people from [[Kiev]], rendering an area of land unusable to humans for an indeterminate period.&lt;ref name = cost&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sovacool | first1 = Benjamin K. | authorlink = Benjamin K.

As radioactive materials decay, they release particles that can damage the body and lead to cancer, particularly [[cesium-137]] and [[iodine-131]]. In the Chernobyl disaster, releases of cesium-137 contaminated land. Some communities, including the entire city of Pripyat, were abandoned permanently. One news source reported that thousands of people who drank milk contaminated with radioactive iodine developed thyroid cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/04/12/112048/us-begins-to-reconsider-nuclear.html |title=Japan's nuclear crisis comes home as fuel risks get fresh look |author=Renee Schoof  |date=April 12, 2011  |work=McClatchy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusion zone (approx. 30&amp;nbsp;km radius around Chernobyl) may have significantly elevated levels of radiation, which is now predominantly due to the decay of [[cesium-137]], for around 10 half-lives of that isotope, which is approximately for 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearinfo.net/Nuclearpower/HealthEffectsOfTheChernobylAccident Health Impact of the Chernobyl Accident], NuclearInfo.net website, August 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===SL-1 meltdown===
[[File:Sl-1-ineel81-3966.jpg|thumb|This image of the SL-1 core served as a sober reminder of the damage that a [[nuclear meltdown]] can cause.]]
The [[SL-1]], or Stationary Low-Power Reactor Number One, was a [[United States Army]] experimental [[nuclear reactor|nuclear power reactor]] which underwent a [[steam explosion]] and [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] on January 3, 1961, killing its three operators; John Byrnes, Richard McKinley, and Richard Legg.&lt;ref name=radiationworks&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The direct cause was the improper manual withdrawal of the central [[control rod]], responsible for absorbing neutrons in the reactor core. This caused the reactor power to surge to about 20,000MW and in turn, an explosion occurred. The event is the only known fatal reactor accident in the United States and the first to occur in the world.&lt;ref name=ProvePrinciple16&gt;{{cite book

===Attacks and sabotage===
{{Main|Vulnerability of nuclear plants to attack}}
[[Nuclear power plant]]s, [[uranium enrichment]] plants, fuel fabrication plants, and even potentially uranium mines are vulnerable to attacks which could lead to widespread [[radioactive contamination]]. The attack threat is of several general types: commando-like ground-based attacks on equipment which if disabled could lead to a reactor [[core meltdown]] or widespread dispersal of radioactivity; and external attacks such as an aircraft crash into a reactor complex, or cyber attacks.&lt;ref name=fas12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/pubs/_docs/Nuclear_Energy_Report-lowres.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power in the United States |author1=Charles D. Ferguson |author2=Frank A. Settle |year=2012 |work=Federation of American Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Terrorists could target [[nuclear power plant]]s in an attempt to release [[radioactive contamination]] into the environment and community.

Nuclear reactors become preferred targets during military conflict and have been repeatedly attacked by military air strikes:&lt;ref name=benj&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', World Scientific, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In September 1980, Iran bombed the incomplete Osirak reactor complex in Iraq.
*In June 1981, an Israeli air strike completely destroyed Iraq’s Osirak reactor.
*Between 1984 and 1987, Iraq bombed Iran’s incomplete Bushehr nuclear plant six times.
*In Iraq in 1991, the U.S. bombed three nuclear reactors and an enrichment pilot facility.

The United States 9/11 Commission has said that nuclear power plants were potential targets originally considered for the [[September 11, 2001]] attacks. If terrorist groups could sufficiently damage safety systems to cause a [[core meltdown]] at a nuclear power plant, and/or sufficiently damage spent fuel pools, such an attack could lead to a widespread radioactive contamination. According to a 2004 report by the U.S. [[Congressional Budget Office]], "The human, environmental, and economic costs from a successful attack on a nuclear power plant that results in the release of substantial quantities of radioactive material to the environment could be great."&lt;ref name="cbo.gov"&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=6042&amp;type=0&amp;sequence=3 "Congressional Budget Office Vulnerabilities from Attacks on Power Reactors and Spent Material"].&lt;/ref&gt; An attack on a reactor’s [[spent fuel pool]] could also be serious, as these pools are less protected than the reactor core. The release of radioactivity could lead to thousands of near-term deaths and greater numbers of long-term fatalities.&lt;ref name="fas12"/&gt;

Insider sabotage occurs because insiders can observe and work around security measures. In a study of insider crimes, the authors repeatedly said that successful insider crimes depended on the perpetrators’ observation and knowledge of security vulnerabilities. Since the [[atomic age]] began, the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]’s nuclear laboratories have been known for widespread violations of security rules. A better understanding of the reality of the insider threat will help to overcome complacency and is critical to getting countries to take stronger preventative measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amacad.org/content/publications/pubContent.aspx?d=1427 |title=A Worst Practices Guide to Insider Threats: Lessons from Past Mistakes |author=[[Matthew Bunn]] and [[Scott Sagan]] |date=2014 |work=The American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have emphasized the need to make nuclear facilities extremely safe from sabotage and attacks that could release massive quantities of radioactivity into the environment and community. New reactor designs have features of [[passive safety]], such as the flooding of the reactor core without active intervention by reactor operators. But these safety measures have generally been developed and studied with respect to accidents, not to the deliberate reactor attack by a terrorist group. However, the US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] does now requires new reactor license applications to consider security during the design stage.&lt;ref name=fas12/&gt;

Following the 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] there has been an increased focus on the risks associated with [[earthquake|seismic activity]] and the potential for environmental radioactive release. [[Genpatsu-shinsai]], meaning ''nuclear power plant earthquake disaster'' is a term which was coined by Japanese [[Seismology|seismologist]] Professor [[Katsuhiko Ishibashi]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="ishibashi-slides-2003"&gt;[http://historical.seismology.jp/ishibashi/opinion/0307IUGG_slides.pdf Genpatsu-Shinsai: Catastrophic Multiple Disaster of Earthquake and Quake-induced Nuclear Accident Anticipated in the Japanese Islands (Slides)], [[Katsuhiko Ishibashi]], 23rd. General Assembly of IUGG, 2003, Sapporo, Japan, accessed 2011-03-28&lt;/ref&gt; It describes a [[domino effect]] scenario in which a major [[earthquake]] causes a severe accident at a [[nuclear power plant]] near a major population centre, resulting in an uncontrollable release of radiation in which the radiation levels make damage control and rescue impossible, and earthquake damage severely impedes the evacuation of the population. Ishibashi envisages that such an event would have a global impact seriously affecting future generations.&lt;ref name="ishibashi-slides-2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ishibashi-abstract-2003"&gt;[http://historical.seismology.jp/ishibashi/opinion/0307IUGG_Genpatsu_Abstract.pdf Genpatsu-Shinsai: Catastrophic Multiple Disaster of Earthquake and Quake-induced Nuclear Accident Anticipated in the Japanese Islands (Abstract)], [[Katsuhiko Ishibashi]], 23rd.

The [[1999 Blayais Nuclear Power Plant flood]] was a [[flood]] that took place on the evening of December 27, 1999.

==Sustainability==
According to [[Joshua M. Pearce]] of [[Michigan Technological University]], on a global-scale a “sustainable nuclear power system” would entail: (i) dramatically improving [[efficient energy use]] and greenhouse gas emissions intensity by updating technology and functionality through the entire life cycle; (ii) improving nuclear security to reduce nuclear power risks and making sure that the nuclear industry can operate without large public nuclear accident insurance subsidies; (iii) eliminating all radioactive waste at the end of life and minimizing the environmental impact during the nuclear fuel cycle; and (iv) the nuclear industry must regain public trust or face obsolescence, as a diverse range of [[renewable energy]] technologies are quickly commercialized. Pearce also believes that the nuclear industry must address the issue of equity, both in the present and for later generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/4/6/1173 |title=Limitations of Nuclear Power as a Sustainable Energy Source |author=Joshua M.

Nuclear decommissioning is the process by which a [[nuclear power plant]] site is dismantled so that it will no longer require measures for radiation protection.

Decommissioning is an administrative and technical process. It includes clean-up of radioactivity and progressive demolition of the plant. Once a facility is fully decommissioned, no danger of a radiologic nature should persist. The costs of decommissioning are to be spread over the lifetime of a facility and saved in a decommissioning fund. After a facility has been completely decommissioned, it is released from regulatory control, and the licensee of the plant will no longer be responsible for its nuclear safety. With some plants the intent is to eventually return to "greenfield" status.

[[File:Matteo Maestri e Birò.jpg|thumb|alt=Matteo Maestri, CEO of Estrima, standing beside a Birò microcar in what seems to be an apartment|Matteo Maestri, CEO of Estrima, and a Birò microcar]]'''Birò''' is a four-wheeled electric vehicle with two seats side by side. It is produced and distributed by Estrima, an Italian company located in [[Pordenone]].
It belongs to the category of electric [[mopeds]], in particular to light [[Motorised quadricycle|quadricycle]] mopeds.
Depending on the country you are in it is legally comparable to a {{convert|50|cc|abbr=on}} moped: its maximum speed is {{convert|45|km/h|abbr=on}} and can go up to {{convert|55|km/h|abbr=on}} with a small controller update. In [[Italy]] it can be driven from the age of 14 with a driver's license.

==History==
Estrima is a [[startup company]] established in Pordenone in 2008 by its president, Matteo Maestri, with the intention of evolving the experience of the family corporation Brieda Srl into new emerging sectors.
The goal of Estrima is to reduce urban mobility problems such as [[traffic congestion]] and [[pollution]] by creating the smallest four-wheel electric vehicle on the market, the Birò.
Production of the vehicle started in June 2009, and in 2010 and 2011 Birò was the most registered electric vehicle in Italy among the categories of 2, 3 and 4 wheels.
At the end of 2012, Red Circle Investments, the company of the Rosso family, acquired 30% of the shares of Estrima.

==Features==
===Aesthetic===
Birò is the smallest four-wheel electric vehicle on the market; it is {{convert|1.03|m|in}} wide and {{convert|1.74|m|in}} long. The vehicle has a reinforced dark-green roof and rear glass, a roomy compartment, a headrest and an armrest. The roof can be opened for ventilation. Available options are kit doors, radio pre-installation and an external trunk trolley.

The Birò has much larger windows than other microcars, resulting in better visibility for the driver and more appealing looks of the car.

The structure of the Birò is made of 3&amp;nbsp;mm thick tubular [[steel]], protecting the driver and the passenger.

===Technical===
The very low center of gravity of Birò ensures stability and a good road grip.

The Birò is driven by two brushless 48&amp;nbsp;V [[electric motor]]s, mounted directly in the rear wheels, producing a total of 4&amp;nbsp;kW of power. Thanks to the electric motors it has great pickup power that can be increased further by pulling the "boost" lever.

For the Birò two different kinds of batteries are available, a pure lead battery and a [[lithium battery]]. Depending on the type of batteries, the Birò has a range of about 40 or 70&amp;nbsp;km, varying according to temperature, driving style, travel type and weight.

===Consumption===
# On a low range or urban cycle, with many start-stop process, the Biro uses 78 Wh/km.
# On a mid range or combined usage, mixing urban traffic and driving open roads, consumption decreases to 64 Wh/km.
# On a maximum range, or extra-urban trip, with open roads, including hills, provided the "Boost" function is not used it can achieve 55 Wh/km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyclurba.fr/forum/262486/vie-fable-d-un-estrima-biro.html?discussionID=0#msg262486 |title=Vie et fable d'un Estrima Biro. Forum Cyclurba.fr. Voitures &amp; camions électriques |publisher=Cyclurba.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the maximum range, if a consumption indicator has been installed, the Ah consumed is the same as the kilometres travelled (25 Ah = 25 km).

===Power===
The current used by the Birò for normal operations is restricted to a maximum of 80 A with a voltage ranging from 36 V to 53 V.
A so-called boost function can be selected for uphill driving. When this function is used the current can temporarily be increased to a restricted maximum of 130 A.

# The "boost" function is restricted as the normal current by the temperature sensor on each motor and by the "36v" low alert voltage.
# At 36 V, the Biro controllers restrict the current to "stay at 36v" ... the speed and torque decrease dramatically (it's not a "reserve indicator").
# The "reserve" way of the Biro it's more like you feel a low torque because of the decrease of the voltage of the battery.

During normal operation the "in drive" voltage is 48 V (in 80 A mode) or 46 V (in 130 A mode).

On "reserve" range, the voltage is 45 V (80 A) and 43 V (130 A) so, at that point, one must find a way to quickly reach a point of recharge.

'''''Extraterrestrial''''' (also '''''Alien Worlds''''' in the UK) is a [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] two-part [[television documentary]] [[miniseries]], aired in 2005 in the UK by [[Channel 4]], by the [[National Geographic Channel]] (as '''''Extraterrestrial''''') in the US on Monday, May 30, 2005&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;{{cite news|last=Lovgran|first=Stefan|title=Flying Whales, Other Aliens Theorized by Scientists|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/05/0520_050520_tv_aliens.html|accessdate=16 October 2011|newspaper=National Geographic News|date=3 June 2005}}{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced by Blue Wave Productions Ltd.

The documentary is based on speculative collaboration of a group of American and British scientists, who were collectively commissioned by [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]. For the purposes of the documentary, the team of scientists divides two hypothetical examples of realistic worlds on which [[extraterrestrial life]] could evolve: A tidally locked [[planet]] orbiting a red dwarf star (dubbed "Aurelia") and a large [[Natural satellite|moon]] (dubbed "Blue Moon") orbiting a [[gas giant]] in a [[binary star system]]. The scientific team of the series used a combination of [[accretion theory]], [[climatology]], and [[xenobiology]] to imagine the most likely locations for extraterrestrial life and most probable [[evolution|evolutionary path]] such life would take.&lt;ref name="Extraterrestrial documentary TV review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Make Contact with Alien Creatures in National Geographic Channel Special 'Extraterrestrial'|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/make-contact-with-alien-creatures-in-national-geographic-channel-special-extraterrestrial-67058057.html|website=www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/|publisher=prnewswire.com|date=20 May 2005|accessdate=27 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028084954/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/make-contact-with-alien-creatures-in-national-geographic-channel-special-extraterrestrial-67058057.html|archive-date=2016-10-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Aurelia" and "Blue Moon" concepts seen in the series were also featured in the touring exhibition [[The Science of Aliens]].

The show's concept shares basic similarities with ''[[The Future is Wild]]''. Both series depict imaginary but scientifically-plausible ecosystems and the species that inhabit them, with commentary by scientists. The key difference is that in ''The Future is Wild'' the ecosystems represent the possible future [[evolution]] of life on planet [[Earth]], while in ''Extraterrestrial'' they are designed from scratch based on possible conditions on [[extrasolar planets]].

== Series concept and scientific basis ==

At the start of the documentary, the presenter and team of scientists draw attention to their reasons for speculating about life on extrasolar planets. Discoveries regarding extrasolar planets were first published in 1989 raising the prospect of whether life (as we know it or imagine it) could be supported on other planets. It is currently believed that for this to happen a planet must orbit in a relatively narrow band around its parent star, where temperatures are suitable for water to exist as a liquid. This region is called the [[habitable zone]].

The most Earth-like exoplanets yet found, [[Gliese 667 Cc]] and [[Gliese 581g]] (disputed), have masses larger than Earth's and orbit red dwarf stars in the habitable zone.

The sensitivity of current detection methods makes it difficult for scientists to search for [[terrestrial planets]] smaller than this. To allow smaller bodies to be detected, [[NASA]] was studying a project called the [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF), a two-[[telescope]] concept slated to begin launching around 2014. However, Congressional spending limits under House Resolution 20 passed on January&amp;nbsp;31, 2007 by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and February&amp;nbsp;14 by the [[U.S. Senate]] have all but canceled the program.

Prior to the TPF's cancellation, astrophysicists had begun speculating about the best places to point the telescope in order to find Earth-like planets. Whereas life on Earth has formed around a stable [[yellow dwarf]], [[solar twins]] are not as common in the galaxy as [[red dwarf]] stars (which have a mass of less than one-half that of the Sun and consequently emit less heat), or bigger, brighter [[blue giant]]s. In addition, it is estimated that more than a quarter of all stars are at least [[binary system]]s, with as many as 10% of these systems containing more than two stars (trinary etc.)—unlike our own sun, which has no companion. Therefore, it may be prudent to consider how life might evolve in such environments. Such speculation may still be of use should a future planet-finding telescope be launched, and possibly for NASA's [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]] mission.

==Episode 1: Aurelia==

The first episode of the series focused on Aurelia, a hypothetical Earth-sized [[extrasolar planet]] orbiting a [[red dwarf]] star in our local area of the [[Milky Way]].

=== Planetary concept ===

The scientists on the project theorized that aiming the TPF at a red dwarf star might yield the best opportunities for seeing smaller planets. Due to the slow rate at which they burn [[hydrogen]], red dwarfs have an enormous estimated lifespan, allowing plenty of time for life to evolve on surrounding planets. Also, red dwarfs are very common in the universe. Therefore, if they support habitable planets, it substantially increases the chances of finding life in the universe. However, being much dimmer than other stars, it will be harder to detect planetary systems around them. In addition, lower gravity would limit the potential size of a system. The discovery of Gliese 581g raises hopes of finding more red dwarf systems, including potentially habitable ones.

However, the dwarf's smaller nature and fainter heat/light output would mean that such a planet would need to be particularly close to the [[star]]'s surface. The cost of such an orbit would be that an Earth-sized body would become [[tidally locked]]. When this happens, the object presents the same face to its parent at all times as it orbits, just as the Moon does with the Earth (more technically, one [[sidereal day]] is exactly equal to one year for the orbiting body).

Traditional scientific theories proposed that such a tidally locked planet might be incapable of holding on to an [[atmosphere]]. Having such a slow rotation would weaken the [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic effect]] that protects the atmosphere from being blown away by [[solar wind]] (see [[Rare Earth hypothesis]]).{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==== Traditional assumptions tested ====

Nonetheless, the scientists employed by the programme decided to test the traditional assumptions for such a planet and start a model out for it from a [[protoplanetary disk]] through to its eventual death. Their estimations suggested such a planet could indeed hold on to its atmosphere, although with freakishly unusual results by Earth standards. Aurelia would be gravitationally locked. Due to this, Aurelia would not have seasons or a day/night cycle,&lt;ref name=natgeo /&gt; as half would be in perpetual darkness, a permanent [[ice age]]. The other half would contain a giant, unending [[hurricane]] with permanent torrential rain at the point directly opposite the local star. Between these two zones, it would be suitable for life.

The giant hurricane might generate enormous waves in the ocean, which would migrate outwards. They would be wind-driven and would not reach the top of an ocean to the bottom, as a [[tsunami]] does. Nonetheless, waves as big and as devastating as those humans call [[Rogue wave|freak waves]] might be regular.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Simple bacterial and algal life would not be threatened.

===Lifeforms of Aurelia===

In continued speculation, and assuming that there was land in this habitable zone, it would be likely to form large networks of [[river deltas]] and [[swampland]], due to rain runoff from the nearby storm.

At the far end of assumptions about Aurelia were attempting to construct lifeforms based on Earthly [[evolution]]ary models and how [[ecosystem]]s might develop. The scientists' assumptions included the idea that the long life of a red dwarf allows for evolution to fine-tune any ecosystem on the planet. The scientists involved in the project hypothesized that the vast majority, if not all, of extra-solar biology, will be [[carbon-based life|carbon-based]].

This assumption is often referred to by critics as [[carbon chauvinism]], as it may be possible for life to form that is [[alternative biochemistry|not based on carbon]].

From this carbon-based hypothesis, the scientific team assumed some form of staple [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] animal/plant combination would be the principal [[autotroph]]. They decided upon a plant-like creature called a Stinger Fan. It has five [[heart]]s and limited mobility. Its fan-like leaves trap the red dwarf star's energy to produce sugars. Its hearts pump them around its body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Richard|title=Stinger Fans on Alien Worlds|url=http://www.wildyorkshire.co.uk/naturediary/docs/2005/11/25.html|work=Richard Bell's Wild West Yorkshire Nature Diary|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=25 November 2005| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070519122256/http://www.wildyorkshire.co.uk/naturediary/docs/2005/11/25.html| archivedate= 19 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeding upon the Stinger Fans are six-legged semi-amphibious beaver-like creatures called Mudpods. They use their long, continually growing thumb claws to cut down a Stinger Fan and dam the river systems, creating artificial lagoons and swamps which provide safety from predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.02/alien.html | title=Alien Animal Planet | author=Cooper, Sean | journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=February 2006 | volume=14 | issue=2 | accessdate=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon that animal, a large [[emu]]-like animal, the Gulphog, is the main predator. These 2-meter tall carnivores live socially in packs and display promising signs of intelligence. Finally, there is a second semi-amphibious creature called the Hysteria – a cross between a plague of [[tadpole]]s and [[piranha]]. These tiny, orange creatures can collect together (in a manner similar to [[slime mold]]s) and form one huge super-organism, moving together up banks to paralyze and consume other animals. Sabian Slugs that live by the water can fall victim to the Hysteria, but it can take something as large as a Gulphog to satisfy them.

The planet's ecosystem suffers from a number of particular peculiarities, most notably evolutionary quirks to allow all living organisms to detect and avoid [[solar flare]]s. Red dwarf stars are unstable and eject frequent solar flares. Such intense [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]] is deadly to all carbon-based life forms as it breaks down the atomic bonds formed by organic compounds. The Gulphogs have adapted by having an ultraviolet light sensitive eye on top of their heads. Stinger Fans fold up to protect themselves. Mudpods have sensitive backs that can sense the ultraviolet rays. The Hysteria's protection is the water. However, the flare stage might only be when the red dwarfs are relatively young.

== Episode 2: Blue Moon ==

[[Image:The Blue Moon.png|thumb|right|250px|A hypothetical rendition of the Blue Moon orbiting high above the plane of its parent gas giant planet.]]
The second episode of the program focuses on a fictional [[moon]] called Blue Moon, which orbits an enormous [[gas giant]] that is itself orbiting a [[binary star system]].

=== Planetary concept ===

The Blue Moon is covered in life-giving water and an [[atmosphere]] so dense that enormous creatures hypothetically can take flight. The Blue Moon orbits a [[Sudarsky extrasolar planet classification#Class II:Water clouds|Water Cloud Jovian planet]] (a Jupiter-like planet that is cool enough to have visible rain clouds in its atmosphere) orbiting a close binary star system. The Blue Moon itself is roughly an earth mass but has an air pressure around three times that of Earth's at sea level.

A distinguishing feature of Blue Moon is that it has no [[polar ice cap]]s: the thick atmosphere keeps temperatures constant across the moon's surface. There is also a greenish haze over the moon from large carpets of floating moss and algae.

The denser atmosphere allows more massive creatures to remain airborne than on Earth. Skywhales, gargantuan [[whale]]-like animals which evolved away from the ocean into the air, fill the ecological niche this creates. Because of the increased muscle power from excess atmospheric oxygen, these creatures can have wingspans of ten meters and remain airborne their entire lives. They feed on the previously mentioned Air Moss. They evolved from seagoing animals into flying ones in one evolutionary leap.

High levels of [[oxygen]] (30% of the atmosphere) push the atmosphere to the brink of spontaneous combustion during [[lightning storm]]s. [[Carbon dioxide]] levels are thirty times higher than on Earth making the air clammy and warm.

===Lifeforms of the Blue Moon===

Skywhales are prey to the [[insect]]-like [[Wiktionary: caped|caped]] Stalkers, colony-living predators that have several different tasks. Scouts find skywhales and mark them with a special scent, then return to the nest to spread the word. Workers then swarm out in huge numbers, detecting the whale and working together to bring them down from the sky and kill them. Finally, there is a queen, who stays in the nest and constantly lays eggs that become new stalkers. This lifestyle is based on earth's [[hornet]]s. The Stalkers are also prey, for the Pagoda branches are draped with the lethal webs of the plant-like ghost traps. Once a Stalker is caught in a ghost trap web, the carnivore uses its tentacles to lift its catch up into its mouth, to be digested by the acid in a primitive stomach.

As well as Skywhales, giant Kites also fly above the [[forest canopy]]. These parasol-like grazers can grow up to {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter and still stay airborne. Their tethers help control their floating, while their [[jellyfish]]-like tentacles snatch Helibug larvæ from the water-filled sky pond. Helibugs have a trilaterally symmetrical body plan, with three eyes, three wings, three legs, three mouthparts and three tongues.

70% of Blue Moon's land mass is coated with two main plant types, pagoda trees, and balloon plants. Pagoda trees interconnect with each other to allow them to grow {{convert|700|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall. Their hollow leaves collect rainwater since the trees are too tall to draw it from the ground. Balloon plants release their seeds by filling them with hydrogen to float in the dense atmosphere, in a way similar to [[kelp]] on Earth.

At the foot of the pagoda forest there is a completely different ecosystem, governed by bioluminescent beings. A wide range of [[fungi]], such as giant [[mushroom]], helibugs and other creatures lurk in the shadows, waiting for any creature from the bottom to fall into their trap. The fungi species have an alert system that warns when the body of a creature falls dead, which soon ends up being digested by them.

The Blue Moon is threatened by mass wildfires that can wipe out entire pagoda forests. Balloon plants grow in the gaps resulting. The floating balloons released by the plants are full of explosive hydrogen, and when a fire hits, they explode like bombs, releasing seeds flying through the air. Skywhales and Kites will gain altitude until the fire ends. The ghost traps sway from branch to branch like monkeys using their tentacles. The Stalkers' escape strategy is unknown.

==Home video releases==

Channel 4 provided a DVD release of the whole documentary (at a run length of 100 minutes) in January 2005.&lt;ref name="Extraterrestrial Documentary 2005 DVD release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extraterrestrial - Alien Worlds [DVD] Amazon.co.uk: DVD and Bluray|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Extraterrestrial-Alien-Worlds-DVD/dp/B000AAVDS8|website=Extraterrestrial - Alien Worlds [DVD] Amazon.co.uk: DVD and Bluray|publisher=Amazon.co.uk, Channel 4|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geothermal Development Company''' (GDC), whose full name is '''Geothermal Development Company Limited''', is a wholly owned [[parastatal]] of the [[government of Kenya]]. It is mandated to execute surface geothermal development, including prospecting, drilling, harnessing and selling steam to electricity generating companies for energy production and sale to the national grid.&lt;ref name="Update"&gt;{{cite web|last=Omenda|

==Location==
The headquarters of GDC are located in the capital city of Nairobi, on Red Cross Road, in the neighborhood known as [[South C]]. The coordinates of GDC's headquarters are: 1°19'32.0"S, 36°49'56.0"E (Latitude:-1.325558; Longitude:36.832222).&lt;ref&gt;{{google maps|accessdate=6 April 2016|

==Overview==
In 2006, Kenya enacted the Energy Act No. 12 of 2006. The energy sector was unbundled into 5 sub-sectors: (a) generation (b) transmission (c) distribution (d) regulation and (e) policy. The country was heavily dependent on hydroelectric energy from the time of independence until the early 2000s. Due to unpredictable rainfall patterns, the levels of the country's rivers fell and Kenya underwent a marked reduction in electricity output in the 2003 to 2006 time frame.&lt;ref name="Update"/&gt;

The country has vast undeveloped geothermal potential along the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Rift Valley]], in excess of 10,000 MW. As at 2012, only 212.5MW of geothermal power was contributed to the national electric grid. As a response to these realities and to fulfill a pledge to install 5,000 MW of electricity by the year 2030, the Kenya Government, in 2008 incorporated Geothermal Development Company to carry out rapid geothermal exploration and drilling to allow independent power producers (IPPs) to build power stations and not only increase but diversify the national electricity grid.&lt;ref name="Update"/&gt;

Outside development partners have offered help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EFIK| url=http://www.ambafrance-ke.org/France-and-Kenya-sign-agreement |

'''Hydrogen leak testing''' is the normal way in which a [[hydrogen]] [[pressure vessel]] or installation is checked for [[leak]]s or [[flaw (defect)|flaw]]s. This usually involves charging hydrogen as a tracer gas into the device undergoing testing, with any leaking gas detected by hydrogen sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fukuda-jp.com/en/leak/f03/|title=Mechanisms of the Hydrogen Leak Test|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fukuda-jp.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various test mechanisms have been devised.

==Test mechanisms==

=== Hydrostatic test ===
In the [[hydrostatic test]], a vessel is filled with a nearly incompressible liquid – usually [[water]] or [[oil]] – and examined for leaks or permanent changes in shape. The test pressure is always considerably higher than the operating pressure to give a margin for safety, typically 150% of the operating pressure.

=== Burst test ===
In the [[burst test]], a vessel is filled with a gas and tested for leaks. The test pressure is always considerably more than the operating pressure to give a margin for safety, typically 200% or more of the operating pressure.

=== Helium leak test ===
The [[Helium mass spectrometer|helium leak test]] uses [[helium]] (the lightest inert gas) as a tracer gas and detects it in concentrations as small as one part in 10 million. The helium is selected primarily because it penetrates small leaks readily, is inert and will not react with the test piece while having a naturally low quantity in air making detection less complicated. It is possible to detect leaks as small as 5.10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s in vacuum mode and modern digital machines can detect 5.10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s in sniffing mode.

=== Vacuum test ===
Usually a vacuum inside the object is created with an external pump connected to the instrument. Alternatively helium can be injected inside the product while the product itself is enclosed in a vacuum chamber connected to the instrument. In this case, burst and leakage tests can be combined in one operation.

=== Hydrogen sensor test ===
During the [[hydrogen sensor]] test, the object is filled with a mixture of  5% [[hydrogen]]/ 95% [[nitrogen]], (below 5.7% hydrogen) is non-flammable (ISO-10156). This is called typically a sniffing test. The handprobe connected to the microelectronic hydrogen sensors is used to check the object. An audiosignal increases in proximity of a leak. Detection of leaks go down to 5x10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; cubic centimeters per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reedlink.com/SingleArticle~ContentId~11957~pub~IA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111211007/http://www.reedlink.com/SingleArticle~ContentId~11957~pub~IA.html |archivedate=2006-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the helium test, hydrogen is cheaper than helium, no need for a vacuum, the instrument could be cheaper but is not as sensitive as a helium leak detector so will not find smaller leaks.

Chemo-chromic hydrogen leak detectors are materials that can be proactively applied to a connection or fitting. In the event of a hydrogen leak, the chemo-chromic material changes color to alert an inspector that a leak is present. Chemo-chromic indicators can also be added to silicone tapes for hydrogen detection purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detectape.com/ |title=DetecTape H2 - Low Cost Visual Hydrogen Leak Detector |publisher=Detectape.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2307">[[International standard]] '''[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 61400-25''' (Communications for monitoring and control of wind power plants, TC 88) provides uniform information exchange for monitoring and control of wind power plants. This addresses the issue of proprietary communication systems utilizing a wide variety of protocols, labels, semantics, etc., thus enabling one to exchange information with different wind power plants independently of a vendor. It is a subset of [[IEC 61400]]; a set of standards for designing wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec61400-1%7Bed3.0%7Den.pdf International Standard IEC 61400-1, Third Edition] ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'', August 2005. Accessed: 12 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IEC 61400-25 standard is a basis for simplifying the roles that the [[wind turbine]] and [[SCADA]] systems have to play. The crucial part of the [[wind power plant]] information, information exchange methods, and communication stacks are standardized. They build a basis to which procurement specifications and contracts could easily refer.

The standard has specified five mapping (IEC 61400-25-4) to communication protocol stacks in order to address the real wind power business needs for communication. The mappings specified in the part of IEC 61400-25 comprises a mapping to [[SOAP]]-based [[web service]]s, [[OLE for process control|OPC]]/[[XML]]-[[OPC Data Access|DA]], [[IEC 61850]]-8-1 [[Manufacturing Message Specification|MMS]], [[IEC 60870-5]]-104 and a mapping to [[DNP3]].

== Interoperability ==
For supporting the interoperability of the IEC 61400-25 standard, a user group was formed with a high degree of cooperation with user groups on [[IEC 61850]] and [[DNP3]]. Users, manufacturers, service providers, and system integrators with interest in the specific issues on interoperatibility are recommend to address the IEC 61400-25 user group on http://www.USE61400-25.com/.

The '''Kaiser effect''' is a phenomenon observed in geology and material science that describes a pattern of [[acoustic emission]] or [[seismicity]] in a body of rock or other material subjected to repeated cycles of mechanical [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]. In material that exhibits an initial seismic response under a certain load, the Kaiser effect describes the absence of acoustic emission or seismic events until that load is exceeded. The Kaiser effect results from discontinuities (fractures) created in material during previous steps that do not move, expand, or propagate until the former stress is exceeded.

== Observed examples of the Kaiser effect ==
=== Borehole seismicity ===
Induced seismicity associated with fluid pumping in boreholes and wells often exhibits the Kaiser effect, whereby seismicity may be observed shortly following an initial fluid injection, but further seismicity is limited if the fluid flow remains at a constant pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Zang, A., Oye, V., Jousset, P., Deichmann, N., Gritto, R., McGarr, A., ... &amp; Bruhn, D. (2014). Analysis of induced seismicity in geothermal reservoirs–An overview. Geothermics, 52, 6-21.&lt;/ref&gt; If the fluid pressure at the injection site is later increased, renewed seismicity may be observed due to the greater ease of fracturing caused by higher pore fluid pressure in the rock.

=== Volcanic systems ===
The Kaiser effect has also been observed in relation to recharge of [[Magma chamber|magma chambers]] below active volcanic systems.&lt;ref&gt;Heimisson, E. R., Einarsson, P., Sigmundsson, F., &amp; Brandsdóttir, B. (2015). Kilometer‐scale Kaiser effect identified in Krafla volcano, Iceland. Geophysical Research Letters, 42(19), 7958-7965.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Land Trust Alliance''', originally formed in 1982 as the Land Trust Exchange, is a national conservation organization representing more than 1,700 [[land trust]]s across the [[United States]]. The organization describes its objectives as working to increase the pace and quality of conservation by advocating favorable tax policies, training land trusts in best practices, and working to ensure the permanence of conservation in the face of continuing threats. The Land Trust Alliance is based in Washington, DC. As of December 2010, national, regional and local land trusts have conserved a total of 47 million acres (190,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;²&lt;/sup&gt;) of land in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtrustalliance.org/land-trusts/land-trust-census/census The Land Trust Alliance] - Official website, October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''low-carbon fuel standard''' (LCFS) is a rule enacted to reduce [[carbon intensity]] in transportation fuels as compared to conventional [[petroleum fuel]]s, such as [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. The most common low-carbon fuels are [[alternative fuel]]s and cleaner [[fossil fuel]]s, such as [[natural gas]] ([[Compressed Natural Gas|CNG]] and [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]). The main purpose of a low-carbon fuel standard is to decrease [[carbon dioxide]] emissions associated with  vehicles powered by various types of internal combustion engines while also considering the entire [[Life cycle assessment|life cycle]] ("well to wheels"), in order to reduce the [[carbon footprint]] of transportation.

The first low-carbon fuel standard mandate in the world was enacted by [[California]] in 2007, with specific eligibility criteria defined by the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) in April 2009 but taking effect in January 2011.&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=california-adopts-low-carF|title= California Adopts Low-Carbon Fuel Standard|author=Debra Kahn  |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |date=2009-04-24|accessdate=2009-05-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFG042409"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT042409"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN0409"/&gt; Similar legislation was approved in [[British Columbia]] in April 2008,&lt;ref name="Vancouver08"/&gt; and by [[European Union]] which proposed its legislation in January 2007 and which was adopted in December 2008.&lt;ref name="EU08"/&gt;  The [[United Kingdom]] is implementing its [[Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation]] Program, which also applies the concept of low-carbon fuels.&lt;ref name="UKRTFO"/&gt;

Several bills have been proposed in the [[United States]] for similar low-carbon fuel regulation at a national level but with less stringent standards than California.&lt;ref name="TwoBillion"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Sperling, Daniel and Deborah Gordon | title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability | year = 2009 | pages= 194–196 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]], New York| isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2010 none have been approved. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) issued its final rule regarding the expanded [[Renewable Fuel Standard]]  (RFS2) for 2010 and beyond on February 3, 2010.&lt;ref name=EPArule2010/&gt; This ruling, as mandated by the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] (EISA), included [[ILUC|direct emissions and significant indirect emissions from land use changes]].&lt;ref name=EPAdraft/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA0509/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA2010/&gt;

==California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard==

[[Californian Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] issued [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] S-1-07 on January 19, 2007 to enact a low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS).&lt;ref name="GovernorPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?/press-release/5074|title= Gov. Schwarzenegger Issues Directive to Establish World's First Low Carbon Standard for Transportation Fuels|publisher=Office of the Governor (Press Release)|date=2007-01-07 |accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CARB01"/&gt; The LCFS requires [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] and distributors to ensure that the mix of fuel they sell in the Californian market meets the established declining targets for [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions measured in [[carbon dioxide equivalent|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent]] [[gram]]s per unit of fuel energy sold for transport purposes. The LCFS directive calls for a reduction of at least 10 percent in the carbon intensity of California's transportation fuels by 2020. These reductions include not only [[tailpipe]] emissions but also all other associated emissions from production, distribution and use of transport fuels within the state. Therefore, California LCFS considers the fuel's [[Life cycle assessment|full life cycle]], also known as the "well to wheels" or "seed to wheels" efficiency of transport fuels.&lt;ref name="TwoBillion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CARB01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/lcfs.htm|title=Low-Carbon Fuel Standard Program|publisher=[[California Air Resources Board]]|date=2009-04-14|accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard is also aimed to reduce the state’s dependence on petroleum, create a market for clean transportation technology, and stimulate the production and use of alternative, low-carbon fuels in California.&lt;ref name="ARBproposal"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/2009/lcfs09/lcfsisor1.pdf |format=PDF|title=Proposed Regulation to Implement the Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Volume I: Staff Report: Initial Statement of Reasons|publisher=[[California Air Resources Board]]|date=2009-03-05|accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LCFS is a mix of [[command and control regulation]] and  [[emissions trading]], as it will use market-based mechanisms that allow providers to choose how they will reduce emissions while responding to consumer demand. Some believe that oil companies could opt for several actions to comply. For example, they state that refiners and producers could improve the efficiency of the refineries and upstream production, or may purchase and blend more low-carbon ethanol into gasoline products, or purchase credits from electric utilities supplying low carbon electrons to electric passenger vehicles, or diversifying and selling low carbon hydrogen for use by vehicles as a product, or any new strategy as the standard is being designed.&lt;ref name="TwoBillion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GovernorPR"/&gt; The [[California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]] authorized the establishment of emissions trading in California, with rules to be adopted by 2010, and taking effect no later than January 2012.&lt;ref name="TwoBillion"/&gt;

===Regulatory proceedings===

In accordance to the [[California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]] and the Governor's Directive, the [[California Air Resources Board]] is the agency responsible for developing the "Low-Carbon Fuel Standard Program", and it was directed to initiate the regulatory proceedings to establish and implement the LCFS."&lt;ref name="TwoBillion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CARB01"/&gt; CARB identified the LCFS as an early action item with a regulation to be adopted and implemented by 2010.&lt;ref name="CARB01"/&gt; Also Executive Order S-1-07 ordered the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]] to coordinate activities between the [[University of California]], the [[California Energy Commission]] and other state agencies to develop and propose a draft compliance schedule to meet the 2020 target.&lt;ref name="CARB01"/&gt;

As mandated by the Executive Order, a University of California team, led by [[Daniel Sperling]] of [[University of California Davis|UC Davis]] and the late [[Alexander E. Farrell]] ([[University of California Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]), developed two reports that established the technical feasibility of an LCFS, proposed the methodology to calculate the full life cycle GHG emissions from all fuels sold in the state, identified technical and policy issues, and provided a number of specific recommendations, thus providing an initial framework for the development of CARB's LCFS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/low_carbon_fuel_standard/UC_LCFS_study_Part_1-FINAL.pdf|format=PDF |title=A Low-Carbon Fuel Standard for California - Part 1: Technical Analysis |publisher=[[University of California]] |author=Alexander E.

====Public consultation process====
During 2008 and until the April 2009 LCFS ruling, CARB published in its website all technical reports prepared by its staff and collaborators regarding the definition and calculations related to the proposed LCFS regulation, conducted 16 public workshops, and also submitted its studies for external peer review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/lcfs.htm |title=Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program |publisher=[[California Air Resources Board]] |accessdate=2009-04-28}}'' See activities listed throughout the page with links to the reports, and records of public activities''.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the April 23, 2009 ruling, the Board held a 45-day public hearing that received 229 comments, 21 of which were presented during the Board Hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/lispub/comm/bccommlog.php?listname=lcfs09|title=Comment Log for Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS09) |publisher=[[California Air Resources Board]] |accessdate=2009-04-28}} ''All letters and attachments are posted for public view of this site''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy about indirect land use impacts====

Among relevant and controversial comments submitted to CARB as public letters, on June 24, 2008, a group of 27 scientists and researchers from a number of universities and national laboratories, expressed their concerns arguing that there "''is not enough hard empirical data to base any sound policy regulation in regards to the indirect impacts of renewable biofuels production. The field is relative new, especially when compared to the vast knowledge base present in fossil fuel production, and the limited analyses are driven by assumptions that sometimes lack robust empirical validation''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bioenergywiki.net/images/7/7b/DOE_letter.pdf |format=PDF |title= Public letter to Mary D. Nichols, Chairman California Air Resources Board|publisher=BioenergyWiki |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GCC08"/&gt; With a similar opposing position, on October 23, 2008, a letter submitted to CARB by the New Fuels Alliance, representing more than two-dozen advanced biofuel companies, researchers and investors, questioned the Board intention to include [[ILUC|indirect land use change]] (ILUC).&lt;ref name="GCC08"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/10/biofuel-compani.html |title=Biofuel Companies Question ARB’s Inclusion of Indirect Effects in Low Carbon Fuel Standard |publisher=[[Green Car Congress]] |date=2008-10-24 |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newfuelsalliance.org/NFA%20ARB%20ILUC%20Press%20Release%20Final.pdf |format=PDF |title=Leading Advanced Biofuel Companies, Researchers, Investors Call on Air Resources Board to Reconsider Draft Low Carbon Fuel Regulations |publisher=New Fuels Alliance |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another public letter just before the ruling meeting, more than 170 scientists and economists sent a letter to CARB, urging it to account for GHG emissions from indirect land use change for biofuels and all other transportation fuels. They argued that ''"...there are uncertainties inherent in estimating the magnitude of indirect land use emissions from biofuels, but assigning a value of zero is clearly not supported by the science."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/call_to_action_biofuels_and_land_use_change.pdf |format=PDF |title=Public letter to Mary D.

===2009 Ruling===

On April 23, 2009, CARB approved the specific rules and carbon intensity reference values for the LCFS that will go into effect on January 1, 2011.&lt;ref name="SFG042409"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/04/23/BABA1782HB.DTL&amp;type=green&amp;tsp=1 |title=Air Resources Board moves to cut carbon use |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |author=Wyatt Buchanan |date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT042409"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E6DB113CF937A15757C0A96F9C8B63 |title=California: Low-Carbon-Fuels Mandate |publisher=[[New York Times]] |author=[[The Associated Press]]|date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technical proposal was approved without modifications by a 9-1 vote, to set the 2020 maximum carbon intensity reference value for gasoline to 86 grams of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] released per [[megajoule]] of energy produced.&lt;ref name="UNICA01"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://world-wire.com/news/0904230003.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426072816/http://world-wire.com/news/0904230003.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-04-26 |title=Sugarcane Ethanol Passes Critical Test in California |publisher=World-Wire |author=[[UNICA, Brazil|UNICA]] Press release |date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2009-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One standard was established for gasoline and the alternative fuels that can replace it, and a second similar standard is set for diesel fuel and its replacements.&lt;ref name ="CARBruleB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/lcfs_att_b_mod.pdf |format=pdf|title=Draft Attachment B: Public Hearing to Consider Adoption of a Proposed Regulation to Implement the Low Carbon Fuel Standard -  Staff’s Suggested Modifications to the Original Proposal|date=2003-04-23|publisher=CARB|accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation is based on an average declining standard of [[carbon intensity]] that is expected to achieve 16 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2020.&lt;ref name="CARBpr"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/nr042309b.htm |title=California Adopts Low Carbon Fuel Standard |publisher=[[California Air Resources Board]] Press release |date=2009-04-23 |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426085637/http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/nr042309b.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10226803-54.html |title=Calif. sets low-carbon standard for cars |publisher=CNetNews |author=Jonathan Skillings |date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; CARB expects the new generation of fuels to come from the development of technology that uses [[cellulosic ethanol]] from [[algae]], wood, agricultural waste such as [[straw]] and [[switchgrass]], and also [[natural gas]] from municipal solid waste.

The ruling is controversial. Representatives of the US ethanol industry complained that this rule overstates the environmental effects of corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of [[Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels|indirect effects of land-use changes]] as an unfair penalty to home-made corn ethanol because deforestation in the developing world is being tied to US ethanol production.&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT042409"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SFC042209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT042409_2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/low-carbon-fuel-standard/?scp=1-b&amp;sq=Calif.+approves+nation%27s+1st+low+carbon+fuel+standard&amp;st=nyt |title=California Fuel Move Angers Ethanol Makers  |publisher=[[New York Times]] |author=  Kate Galbraith|date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BDigest"&gt;{{cite web|title=CARB votes 9-1 for California Low Carbon Fuel Standard; moves up indirect land use review to Jan 2011 in response to outcry on ILUC |url=http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/blog2/2009/04/24/carb-votes-9-1-for-california-low-carbon-fuel-standard-moves-up-indirect-land-use-review-to-jan-2011-in-response-to-outcry-on-iluc/ |publisher=BiofuelsDigest |author=Jim Lane |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2009-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911202522/http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/blog2/2009/04/24/carb-votes-9-1-for-california-low-carbon-fuel-standard-moves-up-indirect-land-use-review-to-jan-2011-in-response-to-outcry-on-iluc |archivedate=2009-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenM"/&gt; The initial reference value set for 2011 for LCFS means that [[ethanol fuel in the United States|Mid-west corn ethanol]] will not meet the California standard unless current carbon intensity is reduced.&lt;ref name="SFG042409"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN0409"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BDigest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SACBee"/&gt; Oil industry representatives complained that there is a cost associated to the new standard, as the LCFS will limit the use of corn ethanol blended in gasoline, thus leaving oil refiners with few available and viable options, such as sugarcane ethanol from Brazil, but this option means paying costly U.S. import tariffs.&lt;ref name="GreenM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/california-adopts-low-carbon-fuel-standard-6083.html|title=California Adopts Low Carbon Fuel Standard|publisher=GreenMedia|author=Jeff St. John |date=2009-04-23|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SACBee"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1808713.html |title=California's low-carbon fuel standard has oil companies anxious |publisher=[[The Sacramento Bee]] |author=Dale Kasler |date=2009-04-25 |accessdate=2009-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430120657/http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1808713.html |archivedate=April 30, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CARB officials and environmentalists reject such scenario because they think there will be plenty of time and economic incentive to developed inexpensive biofuels, hydrogen-based fuels, even ethanol from such cellulosic materials, or new ways to make ethanol out of corn with a smaller carbon footprint.&lt;ref name="GreenM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SACBee"/&gt;

The only Board member who voted against the ruling explained that he had "hard time accepting the fact that we’re going to ignore the comments of 125 scientists", referring to the letter submitted by a group of scientists questioning the indirect land use change penalty.

The LCFS standards established in CARB's rulemaking will be periodically reviewed. The first formal review will occur by January 1, 2011. Additional reviews are expected to be conducted approximately every three years thereafter, or as necessary. The 2011 review will consider the status of efforts to develop low carbon fuels, the compliance schedule, updated technical information, and provide recommendations on metrics to address the sustainable production of low carbon fuels.&lt;ref name ="CARBruleB"/&gt;

According to CARB's ruling, providers of transportation fuels must demonstrate that the mix of fuels they supply meet the LCFS intensity standards for each annual compliance period. They must report all fuels provided and track the fuels’ carbon intensity through a system of "credits" and "deficits." Credits are generated from fuels with lower carbon intensity than the standard. Deficits result from the use of fuels with higher carbon intensity than the standard. A fuel provider meets its compliance obligation by ensuring that amount of credits it earns (or otherwise acquires from another party) is equal to, or greater than, the deficits it has incurred. Credits and deficits are generally determined based on the amount of fuel sold, the carbon intensity of the fuel, and the efficiency by which a vehicle converts the fuel into usable energy. Credits may be banked and traded within the LCFS market to meet obligations.&lt;ref name="ARBproposal"/&gt;

Two "lookup tables" (similar to the one above) and its carbon intensity values are part of the regulation, one for gasoline and another for diesel. The carbon intensity values can only be amended or expanded by regulatory amendments, and the Board delegated to the Executive Officer the responsibility to conduct the necessary rulemaking hearings and take final action on any amendments, other than amending indirect land-use change values included in the lookup tables.&lt;ref name ="CARBruleB"/&gt;

On July 20, 2009, CARB published a Notice of Public Availability of modified text and availability of additional documents regarding the April 2009 rule making (Resolution 09-31), open for public comment until August 19. The supporting documents and information added to the rule making record include new pathways for [[Liquefied Natural Gas]] (LNG) from several sources, [[Compressed Natural Gas]] (CNG) from dairy digester biogas, [[biodiesel]] produced in California from used cooking oil, renewable diesel produced in California from [[tallow]] (U.S. sourced), and two additional new pathways for [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazilian sugarcane ethanol]] which reflect best practices already implemented in some regions of the country.&lt;ref name=UNICA0709/&gt;&lt;ref name=CARB0809&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/2009/lcfs09/lcfs09.htm|title=HEARING ACTION AND SUPPLEMENTAL 15-DAY NOTICES - Posted July 20, 2009|publisher=[[California Air Resources Board]]|date=2009-07-20|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two additional scenarios for sugarcane ethanol were requested by the Board in order to account for improved harvesting practices and the export of electricity from sugarcane ethanol plants in Brazil using energy from [[bagasse]].&lt;ref name=ARBsugarcane/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNICA0709/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biofuels0709/&gt; These two scenarios are not to be considered average for all of Brazilian ethanol but specific cases when such practices are adopted in Brazil. Scenario 1 considers mechanized harvesting of cane which is gradually replacing the traditional practice of burning straw before harvesting cane, and the sale of electricity (co-generated) from power plants that are capable of exporting additional energy beyond that required for processing in the plant (co-product credit). Scenario 2 only considers the export of electricity (co-product) from power plants capable of producing the additional electricity for export. The assumptions or values for the baseline pathway published in February 2009 are the same, including the estimates of [[ILUC|indirect land use change]] for all Brazilian sugarcane scenarios.&lt;ref name=ARBsugarcane/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNICA0709/&gt;

On December 2009 the [[Renewable Fuels Association]] (RFA) and [[Growth Energy]], two U.S. ethanol lobbying groups, filed a lawsuit in the Federal District Court in Fresno, California, challenging the constitutionality of the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). The two organizations are arguing that the LCFS violates both the [[Supremacy Clause]] and the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[US Constitution]], and "''jeopardizes the nationwide market for ethanol''."&lt;ref name=WSJ1209&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126169282611304857|title=Ethanol Groups Sue California Over Low-Carbon Rule|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=2009-12-24|accessdate=2009-12-29 | first=Stephen | last=Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC1209&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/12/rfa-lcfs-20091225.html#more|title=Ethanol Groups File Suit Challenging Constitutionality of California Low Carbon Fuel Standard|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2009-12-25|accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press release both association announced that “''If the United States is going to have a low carbon fuel standard, it must be based on sound science and it must be consistent with the U.S. Constitution''..." and that "''One state cannot dictate policy for all the others, yet that is precisely what California has aimed to do through a poorly conceived and, frankly, unconstitutional LCFS''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renewablefuelsassociation.cmail1.com/T/ViewEmail/y/9E510C2CBC9CF893/968C17640481D3A09A8E73400EDACAB4|title=Ethanol Groups Challenge Constitutionality of California LCFS|publisher=[[Renewable Fuels Association]]|date=2009-12-24|accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional lawsuits against the California regulation were filed by refiners and truckers including Rocky Mountain Farmers Union; Redwood County Minnesota Corn and Soybean Growers; Penny Newman Grain, Inc.; Red Nederend; Fresno County Farm Bureau; Nisei Farmers League; California Dairy Campaign; [[National Petrochemical and Refiners Association]]; [[American Trucking Associations]]; Center for North American Energy Security; and the Consumer Energy Alliance.&lt;ref name=CalBlocked1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/30/us/judge-blocks-californias-low-carbon-fuel-standard.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=California%20fuel%20standard&amp;st=cse|title=Judge Blocks a California Fuel Regulation|author=Felicity Barringer|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2011-12-29|accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CalBlocked2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/12/lcfs-20111231.html|title=California ARB withholding enforcement of LCFS post Federal Court injunction; appealing and seeking stay of injunction; Judge O’Neill’s 3 rulings|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2011-12-31|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In December 2011 a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction against the implementation of California's LCFS. In three separate rulings the judge rejected CARB's defense as he concluded that the state  that the state acted unconstitutionally and the regulation ''“impermissibly treads into the province and powers of our federal government, reaches beyond its boundaries to regulate activity wholly outside of its borders.”'' CARB announced it intends to appeal the decision.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay of the injunction on 23 April 2012 during the tendency of the litigation.  In other words, the challenge to the constitutionality of the LCFS continues, but until it is resolved there is no bar on the CARB continuing to enforce the LCFS. (While the stay did not specifically authorize a return to the LCFS, CARB argued in its briefs before the Court that a stay would "permit the LCFS to go back into effect as though the injunction had never been issued".  That is the approach currently taken by CARB and it continues to refine carbon intensity standards and applicability).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/072413lcfs-rep-adv.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a provision was added to the LCFS that allows refiners to receive credits for the deployment of innovative crude production technologies, such as carbon capture and sequestration or solar steam generation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theicct.org/blogs/staff/carb-looks-innovative-methods-reduce-upstream-oil-production-emissions&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery]] is a form of [[enhanced oil recovery]] (EOR), which is key to harvesting California’s heavy crude.&lt;ref&gt;http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/oil-gas/enhanced-oil-recovery&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, California uses EOR to help produce about 60% of its crude output.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.platts.com/2014/05/30/solar-eor-california-lcfs/&lt;/ref&gt; By using solar power instead of natural gas to create steam for EOR, solar steam generation reduces the amount of emissions produced during oil extraction, thus lowering the overall carbon intensity of crude. California currently has two solar EOR projects in operation, one in McKittrick, operated by LINN Energy (formerly Berry Petroleum) using enclosed trough technology from [[GlassPoint Solar]], and another in Coalinga operated by [[Chevron Corporation]] using [[BrightSource Energy]] power tower technology.

CARB is currently considering an amendment to allow upstream operators to receive credits for deploying innovative crude production technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/lcfs_meetings/041814crudehandout.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, California's LCFS was re-adopted in order to address some of the issues in the original proposed standard. A number of the changes were made, including updated crude provisions, a new model used to be used to calculate carbon intensity, the establishment of a "Credit Clearance" process that would take effect at the end of the year should the LCFS credit market become too competitive, and other provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/lcfs-background.htm|title=Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program Background|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the Seneca Solar Project became the first facility to start earning LCFS credits. Located in the North Midway Sunset oil field in Taft, Kern County, California, this facility met the threshold of 0.10gCO2/ MJ carbon intensity (CI) reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/crude-oil/innovative-crude/2016-0804_seneca-application.pdf|title=Seneca Solar Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after that, in August 2016, the SB 32 was passed, which changed the target for green house gas (GHG) reduction to 40% below the levels in 1990, to be achieved by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.manatt.com/Insights/Newsletters/Climate-Change/Move-Over-AB-32,-Here-Comes-SB-32!-(and-AB-197)|title=SB 32 and AB 197|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is anticipated that this will lead to the tightening of LCFS standards from 2020 all the way through 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/lcfs_meetings/080717conceptpaper.pdf|title=Low Carbon Fuel Standard 2018 Amendments|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, GlassPoint announced a partnership with [[Aera Energy]] to bring its enclosed trough technology to the [[South Belridge Oil Field]], near [[Bakersfield, California]]. When done, the facility will be California’s largest solar EOR field. It is projected to produce approximately 12 million barrels of steam per year through a 850MW thermal solar steam generator. It will also cut carbon emissions from the facility by 376,000 metric tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mailchi.mp/glasspoint/belridge-solar-announcement|title=GlassPoint Announces Belridge Solar Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Senate|Senator]]s [[Barbara Boxer]], [[Dianne Feinstein]], and future President [[Barack Obama]] introduced in 2007 competing bills with varying versions of California's LCFS.&lt;ref name="SFGate0507"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/05/18/MNGR2PTFOD1.DTL&amp;type=printable|title=Governor to detail plans to curb fuel emissions |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |author=Robert Collier |date=2007-05-18 |accessdate=2009-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In March 2007, Senator Dianne Feinstein sponsored the "Clean Fuels and Vehicles Bill", which would have reduced emissions from motor vehicle fuels by 10 percent below projected levels by 2030, and would have required fuel suppliers to increase the percentage of low-carbon fuels – biodiesel, E-85 (made with cellulosic ethanol), hydrogen, electricity, and others – in the motor vehicle fuel supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?ContentRecord_id=a4499663-9559-b897-f40b-7b3ba9c94fcd&amp;FuseAction=NewsRoom.PressReleases |title=Senators Feinstein, Collins and Snowe Introduce Measure to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions from the Use of Motor Vehicles |publisher= Dianne Feinstein Press Release|date=2007-03-30 |accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*California Senator Barbara Boxer presented on May 3, 2007 the "Advanced Clean Fuels Act of 2007". This bill was an amendment to the [[United States Clean Air Act|Clean Air Act]] to promote the use of advanced clean fuels that help reduce air and water pollution and protect the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-1297|title=1297: Advanced Clean Fuels Act of 2007|publisher=Govtrackus|accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Then Senator Obama introduced his bill on May 7, 2007. The "National Low Carbon Fuel Standard Act of 2007" would have required fuel refineries to reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation fuels sold in the U.S. by 5 percent in 2015 and 10 percent in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2007/05/obama-introduces-national-low-carbon-fuel-standard-48427 |title=Obama Introduces National Low-Carbon Fuel Standard |publisher=Renweable Energy World |date=2007-05-17 |accessdate=2009-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===
In March 2009, the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act|Waxman-Markey Climate Bill]] was introduced in the [[U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce]], and it has been praised by top [[Obama Administration]] officials.&lt;ref name="NYT042209"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/04/22/22greenwire-obama-admin-portrays-house-emissions-bill-as-e-10632.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Obama%20admin%20House%20climate%20bill%20economic%20boon&amp;st=cse|title=California Weighs Low-Carbon Fuel Standard|author=Kate Galbraith |publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2009-04-23|accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT042309"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/california-weighs-low-carbon-fuel-standard/|title=Obama admin portrays House climate bill as economic boon|author=Darren Samulsohn |publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2009-04-22|accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill requires a slightly higher targets for reductions in emissions of [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], and other [[greenhouse gas]]es than those proposed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]. The bill proposed a 20-percent emissions reduction from 2005 levels by 2020 (Obama had proposed a 14 percent reduction by 2020). Both plans aim to reduce emissions by about 80 percent by 2050. The Climate Change Bill was approved by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on June 26, 2009. As approved, emissions would be cut 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and 83 percent by 2050.&lt;ref name=Economist07/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT07/&gt;

===EPA Renewable Fuel Standard===
The [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] (EISA) established new renewable fuel categories and eligibility requirements, setting mandatory [[life cycle assessment|life cycle]] [[greenhouse gas]] emissions thresholds for renewable fuel categories, as compared to those of average petroleum fuels used in 2005.&lt;ref name=EPAdraft&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/renewablefuels/420f09024.pdf|format=PDF |title=EPA Lifecycle Analysis of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Renewable Fuels - Technical Highlights |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-06-07}} ''See Table 1''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA0509&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/OMS/renewablefuels/420f09023.htm|title=EPA Proposes New Regulations for the National Renewable Fuel Standard Program  for 2010 and Beyond|publisher=[[US Environmental Protection Agency]] |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; EISA definition of life cycle GHG emissions explicitly mandated the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to include "''direct emissions and significant indirect emissions such as significant emissions from land use changes''."&lt;ref name=EPAdraft/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA0509/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0509&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/05/epa-nprm-20090505.html|title=EPA Proposes New Regulations for Renewable Fuel Standard to Implement Requirements of EISA; GHG Reduction and Indirect Land Use Change Effects Included|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]] |date=2009-05-05|accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 2009 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its [[notice of proposed rulemaking]] for implementation of the 2007 modification of the [[Renewable Fuel Standard]] (RFS).&lt;ref name=GCC0509/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPAproposal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/renewablefuels/#regulations |title=Renewable Fuel Standard Program (RFS2): Notice of Proposed Rulemaking |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draft of the regulations was released for public comment during a 60-day period. EPA's proposed regulations also included the [[carbon footprint]] from [[ILUC|indirect land-use changes]], which, as CARB's ruling, caused controversy among ethanol producers.&lt;ref name="LAT0609"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-corn-ethanol6-2009may06,0,2321568.story |title=New standards could cut tax breaks for corn-based ethanol |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2009-05-06 |author= Jim Tankersley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian0609"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/06/obama-ethanol-green-biofuel|title=Barack Obama's $1.8bn vision of greener biofuel|author= Suzanne Goldenberg |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2009-05-06 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/05/AR2009050503731.html?hpid%3Dmoreheadlines&amp;sub=AR|title=EPA Proposes Changes To Biofuel Regulations |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |author= Steven Mufson and Juliet Eilperin |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth2tech.com/2009/05/05/corn-ethanol-crew-cries-foul-over-epa-emissions-ruling/ |title=Corn Ethanol Crew Cries Foul Over EPA Emissions Ruling |publisher=earth2tech.com |author= Jennifer Kho |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://triangle.bizjournals.com/triangle/prnewswire/press_releases/national/California/2009/05/05/SPTU003 |title=Sugarcane Ethanol Industry Eager to Implement U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard |publisher=National Press Release |author=[[UNICA, Brazil|UNICA]] Press Release|date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, President [[Barack Obama]] signed a [[Presidential Directive]] with the aim to advance biofuels research and improve their commercialization.

An amendment was introduced in the [[House Appropriations Committee]] during the discussion of the fiscal 2010 Interior and Environment spending bill, aimed to prohibit EPA to consider indirect land-use changes in the RFS2 ruling for five years. This amendment was rejected on June 18, 2009 by a 30 to 29 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/06/19/19greenwire-farm-interests-use-epa-spending-bill-to-fight-85048.html |title=Farm Interests Use EPA Spending Bill to Fight Climate Regs|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2009-06-19 |accessdate=2009-06-26 | first1=Robin | last1=Bravender | first2=Ben | last2=Geman | first3=Taryn | last3=Luntz}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar amendment to the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act|Waxman-Markey Climate Bill]] was introduced in the [[U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/06/peterson-20090626.html|title=Compromise Amendment to Waxman-Markey Bill Prohibits EPA From Using Indirect Land Use Change Metrics on Biofuels for 5 Years While National Academies Research the Issue|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Climate Bill was approved by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] with a vote of 219 to 212, and included a mandate for EPA to exclude any estimation of international indirect land use changes due to biofuels for a five-year period for the purposes of the RFS2.

On February 3, 2010, EPA issued its final rule regarding the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard  (RFS2) for 2010 and beyond.&lt;ref name=EPArule2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/OMS/renewablefuels/|title=Renewable Fuel Standard Program (RFS2): Final Rule|publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=2010-02-03|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final rule revises the annual renewable fuel standards, and the required renewable fuel volume continues to increase reaching 36 billion gallons (136.3 billion liters) by 2022. For 2010, EISA set a total renewable fuel standard of 12.95 billion gallons (49.0 billion liters). This total volume, presented as a fraction of a refiner's or importer's gasoline and diesel volume, must be renewable fuel. The final 2010 standards set by EPA are shown in the table in the right side.&lt;ref name=EPA2010/&gt;

As mandated by law, and in order to establish the fuel category for each biofuel, EPA included in its modeling direct emissions and significant indirect emissions such as [[ILUC|emissions from land use changes]] related to the full lifecycle. EPA's modeling of specific fuel pathways incorporated comments received through the third-party peer review process, and data and information from new studies and public comments. EPA's analysis determined that both [[Ethanol fuel in the United States|ethanol produced from corn starch]] and [[Butanol fuel|biobutanol]] from corn starch comply with the 20% GHG emission reduction threshold required to classify as a renewable fuel.&lt;ref name=EPA2010/&gt; EISA [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] existing U.S. corn ethanol plants, and only requires the 20% reduction in life cycle GHG emissions for any renewable fuel produced at new facilities that commenced construction after December 19, 2007.&lt;ref name=EPAdraft/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA0509/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0509/&gt;

EPA also determined that [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|ethanol produced from sugarcane]], both in [[Brazil]] and [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]] countries, complies with the applicable 50% GHG reduction threshold for the advanced fuel category. Both [[Green diesel|diesel produced from algal oils]] and [[biodiesel]] from soy oil and renewable diesel from waste oils, fats, and greases complies with the 50% GHG threshold for the biomass-based diesel category. [[Cellulosic ethanol]] and cellulosic diesel (based on currently modeled pathways) comply with the 60% GHG reduction threshold applicable to cellulosic biofuels.&lt;ref name=EPA2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/OMS/renewablefuels/420f10007.htm#7|title=Greenhouse Gas Reduction Thresholds|publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=2010-02-03|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table summarizes the mean GHG emissions estimated and the range of variations considering that the main source of uncertainty in the life cycle analysis is the emissions related to international land use change GHG emissions.&lt;ref name=EPAFinal2010/&gt;

UNICA, a Brazilian ethanol producers association, welcomed the ruling and commented that they hope the classification of Brazilian sugarcane ethanol as an advanced biofuel will contribute to influence those who seek to lift the trade barriers imposed against clean energy, both in the U.S. and the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=UNICA022010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unica.com.br/noticias/show.asp?nwsCode={BF4E1F8C-A8C0-4E1A-A0F0-208D2513D8DE}|title=Agência ambiental dos EUA reconhece etanol de cana como biocombustível avançado|publisher=[[UNICA, Brazil|UNICA]]|language=Portuguese|date=2010-02-03|accessdate=2010-02-14}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domesticfuel.com/2010/02/04/epa-deems-sugarcane-ethanol-an-advanced-biofuel/|title=EPA Deems Sugarcane Ethanol an Advanced Biofuel|publisher=DOMESTICFUEL.com|date=2010-02-04|accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA's final ruling is expected to benefit Brazilian producers, as the blending mandate requires an increasing quota of advanced biofuels, which is not likely to be fulfill with cellulosic ethanol, and then it would force blenders to import more Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, despite the existing 54¢ per gallon tariff on ethanol imported directly from Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unica.com.br/clipping/show.asp?cppCode=13A49164-27FE-4B6D-A67F-30BD74E1DCCE |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720191940/http://unica.com.br/clipping/show.asp?cppCode=13A49164-27FE-4B6D-A67F-30BD74E1DCCE |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-20 |title=Brazilian Ethanol Producers Hope to Benefit From US Ruling |publisher=[[UNICA, Brazil|UNICA]] |author=Oil Daily |accessdate=2010-02-14 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20100221/BUSINESS01/2210322/1001/=|title=U.S. law assists Brazilian ethanol imports|date=2010-02-21|publisher=[[The Des Moines Register]]|author=Philip Brasher|accessdate=2010-02-23}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of corn-based ethanol, EPA said that manufacturers would need to use “advanced efficient technologies” during production to meet RSF2 limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/business/energy-environment/12biofuel.html|title=Questions About Biofuels' Environmental Costs Could Alter Europe's Policies|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=James Kanter|date=2010-02-11|accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Renewable Fuels Association]] also welcomed the ruling, as ethanol producers "''require stable federal policy that provides them the market assurances they need to commercialize new technologies.''" However, they complained that "''EPA continues to rely on oft-challenged and unproven theories such as international indirect land use change to penalize U.S. biofuels to the advantage of imported ethanol and petroleum.''"&lt;ref name=RFA012010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renewablefuelsassociation.cmail1.com/T/ViewEmail/y/78B3C6C380747C63|title=RFS Rules "Workable" - ILUC Inclusion Still Problematic|publisher=[[Renewable Fuels Association]]|date=2010-02-03|accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other U.S. regional proposals==

Eleven U.S. [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] states have committed to analyzing a single low-carbon fuel standard for the entire region, driving commercialization and creating a larger market for fuels with low [[carbon intensity]]. The standard is aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fuels for vehicles and other uses, including fuel used for heating buildings, industrial processes, and electricity generation.&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARBproposal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="11States01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="11States02"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/Eoeea/docs/pr_lcfs_attach.pdf|format=PDF |title=Letter of Intent: NortheastlMid-Atiantic States Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program |publisher=Massachusetts Government |date= 2008-12-31|accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="11States03"/&gt; Ten of these states are members of the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] (RGGI).&lt;ref name="11States03"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/01/eleven-northeas.html |title=Eleven Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States to Develop Regional Low Carbon Fuel Standard |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) staff has been coordinating with representatives of these States.&lt;ref name="ARBproposal"/&gt; The states developing a regional LCFS are [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]].&lt;ref name="ARBproposal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="11States01"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://green.foxnews.com/2009/01/09/eleven-eastern-states-agree-to-low-carbon-standard/ |title=Eleven Eastern States Agree to Low Carbon Standard |publisher=FoxNews.com |author=The  Associated Press|date=2009-01-09 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Memorandum of Understanding concerning the development of the regional low carbon fuel standard program was signed by the Governors of each State on December 30, 2009, committing the states to an economic analysis of the program, consultation with stakeholders before ruling, and a draft model rule by early 2011.&lt;ref name="ARBproposal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="11States03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nescaum.org/documents/lcfs-mou-govs-final.pdf/ Memorandum of Understanding about the regional LCFS program signed by the Governors of each State on December 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Columbia Low-Carbon Fuel Requirements==
The [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]], [[Canada]], approved in April 2008 the [[Renewable and Low Carbon Fuel Requirements Act]], which mandates fuel suppliers in B.C. to sell gasoline and diesel containing 5% and 4% percent renewable fuels,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/RET/RLCFRR/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, by 2010, and allows the provincial government to set thresholds for the [[carbon intensity]] of fuels, taking into account their entire [[carbon footprint]].&lt;ref name="Vancouver08"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/business/story.html?id=23e7f256-4ebc-4468-974a-c4219d78b13b&amp;p=1 |title=Government brings in low-carbon fuel bill |publisher=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |author=Derrick Penner |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2009-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314153812/http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/business/story.html?id=23e7f256-4ebc-4468-974a-c4219d78b13b&amp;p=1 |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bill 16"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.leg.bc.ca/38th4th/amend/gov16-2.htm#section6 |title= Bill 16 - 2008: Greenhouse Gas Reduction (Renewable and Low Carbon Fuel Requirements) Act|publisher= [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]] |date=2008-04-17 |accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RLCFR Act also provides flexibility for regulated fuel suppliers to meet their obligations as they may receive notional transfers of renewable fuels and of attributable greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Bill 16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=66514 |title=Canada: Climate Change Law Update: Recent North American Developments - June 2008 |publisher=Mondaq |author=Gray E.

==Europe==

===Existing regulations===
The EU has mainly acted to mitigate road transport greenhouse emissions mainly through its voluntary agreement on CO2 emissions from cars and subsequently through Regulation 443/2009 which sets mandatory CO2 emission limits for new cars. The EU promoted the use of biofuels through the [[directive on the promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport]] (2003/30/EC), also known as Biofuel Directive, which calls for countries across the EU aiming at replacing 5,75% of all transport fossil fuels ([[petrol]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]) with [[biofuel]]s by 2010. None of these regulations, however, were based on [[carbon intensity]] of fuel. Fuel quality standards in the [[European Union]] are regulated by [[Directive 98/70/EC]].

Other European countries have their own mandates limiting consumption of conventional [[fossil fuel]]s by substituting to cleaner fuels in order to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, such as the [[United Kingdom]] [[Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation]] Program (RTFO), requiring transport fuel suppliers to ensure that 5% of all road vehicle fuel comes from sustainable renewable sources by 2010.&lt;ref name="UKRTFO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UKfaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/faq |title=Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation: frequently asked questions |publisher=UK Department of Transport (DfT) |date= |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907015825/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/faq |archivedate=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation===
{{main|Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation}}
The [[Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation]] is similar to California's LCFS in some aspects. Biofuel suppliers are required to report on the level of carbon savings and [[sustainability]] of the biofuels they supplied in order to receive Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs). Suppliers have to report on both the net GHG savings and the sustainability of the biofuels they supply according to the appropriate sustainability standards of the feedstocks from which they are produced and any potential indirect impacts of biofuel production, such as [[ILUC|indirect land-use change]] or changes to food and other commodity prices that are beyond the control of individual suppliers.  Suppliers that do not submit a report will not be eligible for RTFO certificates.&lt;ref name="UKRTFO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UKfaq"/&gt;

Certificates can be claimed when renewable fuels are supplied and fuel duty is paid on them. At the end of the obligation period, these certificates may be redeemed to the RTFO Administrator to demonstrate compliance. Certificates can be traded, therefore, if obligated suppliers don't have enough certificates at the end of an obligation period they have to 'buy-out' the balance of their obligation by paying a buy-out price. The buy out price will be 15 pence per litre in the first two years.&lt;ref name="UKRTFO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UKfaq"/&gt;

===EU low-carbon fuel standard===
On January 31, 2007, the [[European Commission]] (EC) proposed new standards for transport fuels to reduce full life cycle emissions by up to 10 percent between 2011 and 2020&lt;ref name="EU07"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2007/2007-01-31-05.asp |title=EU Government Proposes Low Carbon Transport Fuel Standard |publisher= |author=[[Environment News Service]] |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was three weeks after the California LCFS Directive was announced.&lt;ref name="TwoBillion"/&gt; The EU proposal aimed to encourage the development of low-carbon fuels and biofuels, considering reductions in greenhouse gas emissions caused by the production, transport and use of the suppliers fuels.&lt;ref name="EU07"/&gt;

On December 2008 the [[European Parliament]], among other measures to address [[climate change]] in the [[European Union]], approved amendments to the fuel quality directive (98/70) as well as replacing the [[Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport|Biofuels Directive]] with a Directive on the promotion of Renewable Energy Sources as proposed by the European Commission. The revision of Directive 98/07/EC introduced a mechanism to monitor and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the use of road transport fuels, requiring fuel suppliers to reduce GHG emissions by up to 10 percent by 2020 on a life cycle basis. Regarding land use changes, the EC was ordered to "''develop a concrete methodology to minimise greenhouse gas emissions caused by [[Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels|indirect land use changes]]''." The fuel directive includes provisions to promote sustainable biofuels which minimized the impacts of ILUC.&lt;ref name="EU08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+20081217+ITEMS+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN#sdocta5 | title=Texts adopted Wednesday, 17 December 2008: Monitoring and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fuels |author=[[European Parliament]]|date=2008-12-17 |accessdate=2009-04-27}} ''For the text referring to ILUC see item 18''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "ARBproposal"/&gt; The approved goal of 10 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved in several ways, and not exclusively from low-carbon fuels:&lt;ref name="EU08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/12/european-parl-4.html |title=European Parliament Climate Change Package Includes Vehicle CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Regulations and Low Carbon Fuel Standard |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At least 6% by 31 December 2020, compared to the EU-average level of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy from fossil fuels in 2010, obtained through the use of biofuels, alternative fuels and reductions in flaring and venting at production sites.
* A further 2% reduction (subject to a review) obtained through the use of environmentally friendly [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies and electric vehicles.
* An additional further 2% reduction obtained through the purchase of credits under the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] of the [[Kyoto Protocol]].
The Commission is continuing development of the EU LCFS, in particular on the methodology for fossil fuel emissions, has recently consulted&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/pdf/art7a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on various aspects of the implementation and responses have been published.&lt;ref&gt;http://circa.europa.eu/Public/irc/env/fuel_quality/library?l=/article_7a/2009_consultation&amp;vm=detailed&amp;sb=Title&lt;/ref&gt; Further work is underway to address Indirect Land Use Change emissions. Two modelling exercises and a model comparison exercise are being carried out to better understand the scale and nature of indirect land use change due to biofuels before the Commission makes proposals to address it.

On June 10, 2010, the EC adopted guidelines explaining how the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) should be implemented, as the Directive came into effect in December 2010.&lt;ref name=EC0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC0610/&gt; Three measures focus on the criteria for sustainability of biofuels and how to control that only sustainable biofuels are used in the EU. First, the Commission is encouraging E.U. nations, industry and [[NGO]]s to set up voluntary schemes to certify biofuel sustainability. Second, the EC laid down the rules to protect untouched nature, such as forests, wetlands and protected areas, and third, a set of rules to guarantee that biofuels deliver substantial reduction in [[Life cycle assessment#Well-to-wheel|well-to-wheel]] [[greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref name=EC0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0610/&gt;

====Sustainable biofuel certificates====
The EC decided to request governments, industry and NGO's to set up voluntary schemes to certify biofuel sustainability for all types of biofuels, including those imported into the EU.&lt;ref name=EC0610&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/711&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=Commission sets up system for certifying sustainable biofuels|publisher=European Commission|date=2010-06-10|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0610&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/06/ecsust-20100610.html#more|title=European Commission Sets Up System for Certifying Sustainable Biofuels|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2010-06-10|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the EC, the overall majority of biofuels are produced in the EU, and for 2007, only 26% of [[biodiesel]] and 31% of [[ethanol fuel|bioethanol]] consumed in the EU was imported, mainly from [[Brazil]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=BBC0610&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10283258.stm|title=EU biofuels need to be certified for sustainability|publisher=BBC News|author=Mark Kinver|date=2010-06-10|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission set standards that must be met for these schemes to gain EU recognition. One of the main criteria is that the certification scheme must be interdependently audited and fraud-resistant. Auditors must check the whole production chain, from the farmer and mill to the filling station ([[Life cycle assessment#Well-to-wheel|well-to-wheel life cycle]]). Auditors must check all the paper and inspect a sample of the farmers, mills and traders, and also whether the land where the feedstock for the ethanol is produced has been indeed farm land before and not a tropical forest or protected area.&lt;ref name=GCC0610/&gt;  The certificates are to guarantee that all the biofuels sold under the label are sustainable and produced under the criteria set by the Renewable Energy Directive.&lt;ref name=EC0610_2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/247&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=en&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=Commission sets up system for certifying sustainable biofuels: MEMO/10/247|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=2010-06-10|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several private certification systems originally designed for sustainability more generally have adapted their standards to qualify for recognition under the Renewable Energy Directive, including the [[Sustainable biofuel#Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels|Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials]] and [[Bonsucro]].&lt;ref name="SolomonBailis2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christine Moser|author2=Tina Hildebrandt|author3=Robert Bailis|editor=Barry D.

Environmental groups complained the measures "are too weak to halt a dramatic increase in deforestation."&lt;ref name=BBC0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenpeace0610/&gt; According to [[Greenpeace]]  "[[Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels]] (ILUC) production still are not properly addressed" because if not properly regulated, "ILUC impacts will continue causing major biodiversity loss and more greenhosuse gas emissions."&lt;ref name=Greenpeace0610&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/eu-unit/press-centre/press-releases2/broken-biofuel-policies-still|title=Broken biofuel policies still driving rainforest destruction|publisher=Greenpeace European unit|date=2010-06-10|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, industry representatives welcomed the introduction of a certification system and some dismissed the concerns regarding the lack of criteria about ILUC.&lt;ref name=BBC0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT0610&gt;{{cite news|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/parsing-europes-new-biofuel-rules/?emc=eta1|title=Parsing Europe's New Biofuel Rules|author=James Kanter|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Unica0610/&gt;[[UNICA, Brazil|UNICA]], the Brazilian ethanol producers association welcome the rules more cautiously, as they consider "''that gaps in the rules needed to be filled in so the "industry has a clear framework within which to operate".''"&lt;ref name=NYT0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=Unica0610/&gt; Some other industry organizations also said that further clarification is needed in order to implement the Renewable Energy Directive.&lt;ref name=Unica0610&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unica.com.br/clipping/show.asp?cppCode=5C3F6D12-67A2-4614-8746-FBC406C74D38|title=Trade bodies welcome EU biofuels rules, but call for more guidance|publisher=[[UNICA, Brazil]]|author=Platts Commodity News|date=2010-06-11|accessdate=2010-06-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110706154801/http://unica.com.br/clipping/show.asp?cppCode=5C3F6D12-67A2-4614-8746-FBC406C74D38|archivedate=2011-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EC clarified that it would publish a report on [[Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels|the impacts of indirect land use]] by the end of 2010, as requested in the Renewable Energy Directive and on the basis of recently released reports that suggest that biofuels are saving greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name=EC0610_2/&gt;

====Protecting untouched nature====
The rules set by the Commission establish that biofuels should not be made from [[feedstock]]s from [[tropical forest]]s or recently deforested areas, drained [[peatland]], [[wetland]] or highly [[Biodiversity|biodiverse]] areas. The corresponding Communication explains how this should be assessed and as an example, it makes it clear that the conversion of a forest to a [[palm oil]] plantation would not meet the sustainability requirements.&lt;ref name=EC0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC0610/&gt;

====Promote only biofuels with high greenhouse gas savings====
The Commission reiterated that Member States have to meet binding, national targets for renewable energy and that only those biofuels with high [[greenhouse gas emission]] savings count for the national targets. The corresponding Communication explains how to make the calculation, which not only includes [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but also [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), both stronger greenhouse gases than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Biofuels must deliver greenhouse gas savings of at least 35% compared to [[fossil fuel]]s, rising to 50% in 2017 and to 60%, for biofuels from new plants, in 2018.&lt;ref name=EC0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=EC0610_2/&gt;

Each layer of platelets is oriented in a different direction, giving the resulting object greater strength. The inventors claimed that the process is 10x faster than commercial [[3D printing]]. The magnetisation and orientation of the ceramic platelets has been patented.&lt;ref name=zme&gt;{{Cite web|title = Artificial tooth is as good as the real deal|url = http://www.zmescience.com/medicine/magnetic-casting-artificial-enamel-827834/|accessdate = 2015-09-29 |date= September 29, 2015 |first=Alexandru |last=Micu |publisher=ZME}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

The technique involves pouring a suspension of magnetized ceramic micro-plates. Pores in the plaster mold absorb the liquid from the suspension, solidifying the material from the outside in. The particles are subjected to a strong [[magnetic field]] as they solidify that causes them to align in one direction. The field’s orientation is changed at regular intervals, moving the plates still in suspension, without disturbing already-solidified plates. By varying the composition of the suspension and the direction of the platelets, a continuous process can produce multiple layers with differing material properties in a single object. The resulting objects can closely imitate their natural models.&lt;ref name=zme/&gt;

== Artificial tooth ==

Researchers produced an artificial tooth whose microstructure mimicked that of a real tooth. The outer layers, corresponding to enamel, were hard and structurally complex. The outer layers contained glass [[nanoparticles]] and [[aluminium oxide]] plates were aligned perpendicular to the surface. After the outer layers hardened, a second suspension was poured. It contained no glass, and the plates were aligned horizontally to the surface of the tooth.  These deeper layers were tougher, resembling [[dentine]]. The tooth was then cooked at 1,600 degrees to compact and harden the material — a process known as [[sintering]]. The last step involved filling remaining pores with a synthetic [[monomer]] used in [[dentistry]], which [[polymerizes]] after treatment.&lt;ref name=zme/&gt; Hardness and durability approximated that of both the enamel and dentine of a tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Creating Fake Teeth as Strong as the Real Deal|url = http://www.rdmag.com/articles/2015/09/creating-fake-teeth-strong-real-deal|date=September 29, 2015 |first=Greg |last=Watry,|accessdate = 2015-09-29 |publisher=R&amp;D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MigrantWatch''' is a [[citizen science]] non-governmental organisation project in [[India]] for collection of information about bird migration. The organisation was conceived in July 2007 and is coordinated by the [http://www.ncbs.res.in/citsci/Citizen Science Programme]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} of the [[The National Centre for Biological Sciences|National Centre for Biological Sciences]], in association with [http://www.indianbirds.in/ Indian Birds] journal.&lt;ref name="MigrantWatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrantwatch.in/ |title=Migrant Watch home page |author=NCBS and Indian Birds Journal |date= |work= |publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the MigrantWatch programme is to collect information on the arrival, presence and departure of migrant birds that spend the winter in India and to assess any changes that occur in the timing of migration.&lt;ref name="Qader &amp; Raza (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quader |first1=S. |last2=Raza |first2=R. H. |year=2008 |title=MigrantWatch: A citizen science programme for the study of bird migration |journal=Indian Birds |publisher=New Ornis Foundation |volume=3 |issue=6  |pages=202–209 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MigrantWatch program provides a website where registered members can upload observations of migratory bird species,and access all the sighting records and maps with data plotted. 

In the first year, the program targeted nine species of migratory birds:&lt;ref name="Qader &amp; Raza (2008)"/&gt;

* Northern shoveller ''[[Anas clypeata]]''
* Marsh harrier, ''[[Circus aeruginosus]]''
* Wood sandpiper ''[[Tringa glareola]]''
* Common (or barn) swallow ''[[Hirundo rustica]]''
* Grey wagtail ''[[Motacilla cinerea]]''
* Brown shrike ''[[Lanius cristatus]]''
* Black redstart ''[[Phoenicurus ochruros]]''
* Greenish warbler ''[[Phylloscopus trochiloides]]''
* Rosy starling ''[[Sturnus roseus]]''

Subsequently, the list was increased to 30 migratory species.

'''Palmitoleic acid''', or (9''Z'')-hexadec-9-enoic acid, is an [[omega-7 fatty acid|omega-7]] [[monounsaturated fat|monounsaturated]] [[fatty acid]] with the formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CH(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;COOH that is a common constituent of the [[glyceride]]s of human [[adipose tissue]].  It is present in all tissues but, in general, found in higher concentrations in the [[liver]]. It is biosynthesized from [[palmitic acid]] by the action of the enzyme [[Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1]]. 

==Dietary sources==

==Assembly of Patchy Particles==

===Simulations===

One simulation done involves a [[Monte Carlo method]], where the best “move” ensures equilibrium in the particle. One type of move is rototranslation. This is carried out by choosing a random particle, random angular and radial displacements, and a random axis of rotation.&lt;ref name="Rovigatti"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rovigatti |first1=Lorenzo, J.R. |last2=Romano |first2=Flavio |title=How to Simulate Patchy Particles |journal=The European Physical Journal E |date=2018 |volume=49 |issue=59 |doi=10.1140/epje/i2018-11667-x |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140%2Fepje%2Fi2018-11667-x.pdf |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rotational degrees of freedom need to be determined prior to the simulation. The particle is then rotated/moved according to these values. Also, the integration time step needs to be controlled because it will affect the resulting shape/size of the particle. 
Another simulation done is the grand-canonical ensemble. In the grand-canonical ensemble, the system is in equilibrium with a thermal bath and reservoir of particles.&lt;ref name="Rovigatti" /&gt; Volume, temperature, and chemical potential are fixed. Because of these constants, a number of particles (n) changes. This is typically used to monitor phase behavior. With these additional moves, the particle is added at a random orientation and random position. 


Other simulations involve biased Monte Carlo moves. One type is aggregation volume-bias moves. It consists of 2 moves; the first tries to form bond between two previously unbonded particles, the second tries to break an existing bond by separation. Aggregation volume-bias moves reflects the following procedure: two particles are chosen, I and J, which are not neighboring particles, particle J is moved inside the bonding volume of particle I. This process is carried out uniformly. Another aggregation volume-bias move follows a method of randomly choosing a particle J that is bonded to I. Particle J is then moved outside the bonding volume of particle I, resulting in the two particles no longer being bonded.&lt;ref name="Rovigatti" /&gt; A third type of aggregation volume-bias move takes a particle I bonded to particle J and inserts it into a third particle.
 

[[Grand canonical ensemble]] is improved by aggregation volume-bias moves. When aggregation volume-bias moves are applied, the rate of monomer formation and depletion in enhanced and the grand-canonical ensemble moves increase. 


A second biased Monte Carlo simulation is virtual move Monte Carlo. This is a cluster move algorithm. It was made to improve relaxation times in strongly interacting, low density systems and to better approximate diffusive dynamics in the system.&lt;ref name="Rovigatti" /&gt; This simulation is good for self-assembling and polymeric systems that can find natural moves that relax the system. 


===Self Assembly===

Self-Assembly is also a method to create patchy particles. This method allows formation of complex structures like chains, sheets, rings, icosahedra, square pyramids, tetrahedra, and twisted staircase structures. &lt;ref name="ZhangNanoLett2004"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Zhang| first=Zhenli| last2=Glotzer| first2=Sharon C.| title=Self-Assembly of Patchy Particles| journal=Nano Letters| date=2004| volume=4| pages=1407–1413| doi=10.1021/nl0493500| bibcode=2004NanoL...4.1407Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; By coating the surface of particles with highly anistropic, highly directional, weakly interacting patches, the arrangement of the attractive patches can organize disordered particles into structures. The coating and the arrangement of the attractive patches is what contributes to the size, shape, and structure of the resulting particle. &lt;ref name="ZhangNanoLett2004"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Zhang| first=Zhenli| last2=Glotzer| first2=Sharon C.| title=Self-Assembly of Patchy Particles| journal=Nano Letters| date=2004| volume=4| pages=1407–1413| doi=10.1021/nl0493500| bibcode=2004NanoL...4.1407Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Emergent valence self-assembly====


Developing entropic patches that will self-assemble into [[simple cubic]], [[simple cubic|body-centered cubic]] (bcc), diamond, and dodecagonal quasicrystal structures. The local coordination shell partially dictates the structure that is assembled.&lt;ref name="vanAndersACSNano2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Anders| first=Greg| last2=Ahmed| first2=N.

This allows for entropic patches to self-assemble.


[[Tetrahedron|Tetrahedral]] faceted spheres are targeted by beginning with simple spheres. In coordination with the faces of a tetrahedron, the sphere is sliced at four equal facets.

Simple cubic lattices are achieved in a similar way by slicing cubic facets into spheres. This allows for the assembly of simple cubic lattices.

The faceting amount, α, is used in the emergent valence self-assembly to determine what crystal structure will form. A perfect sphere is set as α=0.

Changes include effects on self-assembly, packing structure, amount of coordination of the faceting patch to the sphere, shape of the faceting patch, type of crystal lattice formed, and the strength of the entropic patch.&lt;ref name="vanAndersACSNano2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Anders| first=Greg| last2=Ahmed| first2=N.

'''Peds''' are aggregates of soil particles formed as a result of [[Pedogenesis|pedogenic]] processes; this natural organization of particles forms discrete units separated by pores or voids. The term is generally used for macroscopic (visible; i.e. greater than 1 mm in size) structural units when observing soils in the field. Soil peds should be described when the soil is dry or slightly moist, as they can be difficult to distinguish when wet.&lt;ref name="Jahn2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jahn|first1=R.|last2=Blume|first2=H.-P.|last3=Asio|first3=V.B.|last4=Spaargaren|first4=O.|last5=Schad|first5=P.|title=Guidelines for soil description|date=2006|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|isbn=9251055211|edition=4th|pages=44-48|url=http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/fulltext/27622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five major classes of macrostructure seen in soils:  platy, prismatic, columnar, granular, and blocky.  There are also structureless conditions. Some soils have simple structure, each unit being an entity without component smaller units. Others have compound structure, in which large units are composed of smaller units separated by persistent planes of weakness.
[[File:Polyedergefüge.JPG|thumb|right|Blocky peds]]

==Types of soil structures==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
===Platy===

In platy structure, the units are flat and platelike. They are generally oriented horizontally. A special form, lenticular platy structure, is recognized for plates that are thickest in the middle and thin toward the edges. Platy structure is usually found in subsurface soils that have been subject to leaching or compaction by animals or machinery. The plates can be separated with a little effort by prying the horizontal layers with a pen knife. Platy structure tends to impede the downward movement of water and plant roots through the soil.

They are found most frequently in the C, E, Bs and K horizons as well as in [[sesquioxide]]s (very old soils that are rich in iron and magnesium).

===Prismatic===

In the prismatic structure, the individual units are bounded by flat to rounded vertical faces. Units are distinctly longer vertically, and the faces are typically casts or molds of adjoining units. Vertices are angular or subrounded; the tops of the prisms are somewhat indistinct and normally flat. Prismatic structures are characteristic of the B horizons or subsoils. The vertical cracks result from freezing and thawing and wetting and drying as well as the downward movement of water and roots.

===Columnar===

In the columnar structure, the units are similar to prisms and are bounded by flat or slightly rounded vertical faces. The tops of columns, in contrast to those of prisms, are very distinct and normally rounded. Columnar structure is common in the subsoil of sodium affected soils and soils rich in swelling clays such as the [[smectites]] and the kandite [[Halloysite]]. Columnar structure is very dense and it is very difficult for plant roots to penetrate these layers. Techniques such as deep plowing have help to restore some degree of fertility to these soils.

===Blocky===

In blocky structure, the structural units are blocklike or polyhedral. They are bounded by flat or slightly rounded surfaces that are casts of the faces of surrounding peds. Typically, blocky structural units are nearly equidimensional but grade to prisms and to plates. The structure is described as angular blocky if the faces intersect at relatively sharp angles; as subangular blocky if the faces are a mixture of rounded and plane faces and the corners are mostly rounded. Blocky structures are common in subsoil but also occur in surface soils that have a high clay content. The strongest blocky structure is formed as a result of swelling and shrinking of the clay minerals which produce cracks. Sometimes the surface of dried-up sloughs and ponds shows characteristic cracking and peeling due to clays.

===Granular===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Seedbed]] --&gt;

In the granular structure, the structural units are approximately spherical or [[Polyhedron|polyhedral]] and are bounded by curved or very irregular faces that are not casts of adjoining peds. In other words, they look like cookie crumbs. Granular structure is common in the surface soils of rich [[grasslands]] and highly amended garden soils with high [[organic matter]] content. Soil mineral particles are both separated and bridged by organic matter breakdown products, and soil biota exudates, making the soil easy to work. [[Tillage|Cultivation]], [[earthworms]], [[frost action]] and rodents [[bioturbation|mix]] the soil and decreases the size of the peds. This structure allows for good [[porosity]] and easy movement of air and water. This combination of ease in [[tillage]], good moisture and air handling capabilities, and good structure for planting and [[germination]], are definitive of the phrase ''good tilth''.

In [[nanobiotechnology]], a '''peptoid [[nanosheet]]''' is a synthetic protein structure made from [[peptoid]]s. Peptoid nanosheets have a thickness of about three nanometers and a length of up to 100 micrometers, meaning that they have a two-dimensional, flat shape that resembles paper on the nanoscale.&lt;ref&gt;Nam, K.T., Shelby, S.A., Choi, P.H., Marciel, A.B., Chen, R., Tan, L., Chu, T.K., Mesch, R.A., Lee, B., Connolly, M.D., Kisielowski, C., Zuckermann, R.N. “Free-floating ultrathin two-dimensional crystals from sequence-specific peptoid polymers” Nat. Mater. 9(5), 464-460 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

This makes them one of the thinnest known two-dimensional organic [[crystalline]] materials with an area to thickness ratio of greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; nm. Peptoid nanosheets were discovered in the laboratory of Dr. Ron Zuckermann at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] in 2010. Due to the ability to customize peptoids and therefore the properties of the peptoid nanosheet, it has possible applications in the areas of drug and small molecule delivery and [[biosensing]].

==Synthesis==
For assembly, a purified amphiphilic polypeptoid of specific sequence is dissolved in aqueous solution.&lt;ref&gt;Kudirka, R., Tran, H., Sanii, B., Nam, K.T., Choi, P.H., Venkateswaran, N., Chen, R., Whitelam, S., Zuckermann, R.N. “Folding of a single-chain, information-rich polypeptoid sequence into a highly ordered nanosheet” Pept. Sci. 96, 586-595 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; These form a monolayer ([[Langmuir–Blodgett film]]) on the air-water interface with their hydrophobic side chains oriented in air and hydrophilic side chains in the water. When this mono-layer is shrunk, it buckles into a bilayer with the hydrophobic groups forming the interior core of the peptoid nanosheet.&lt;ref&gt;Sanii, B., Kudirka, R., Cho, A., Venkateswaran, N., Olivier, G.K., Olson, A.M., Tran, H., Harada, R.M., Tan, L., Zuckermann, R.N. “Shaken, not stirred: collapsing a peptoid monolayer to produce free-floating, stable nanosheets” J. Am. Chem. Soc. 133, 20808–20815 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; This method has been standardized in the Zuckermann laboratory by repetitively tilting vials of peptoid solution at 85° before returning the vials to the upright position. This repetitive vial “rocking” motion lessens the interfacial area of the air-water interface inside the vial, compressing the peptoid mono-layer by a factor of four and causing the mono-layer to buckle into peptoid nanosheets. Using this method, nanosheets are produced in high yield, and 95% of the peptoid polymer starting material is efficiently converted into peptoid nanosheets after rocking the vials several hundred times.

==Applications==
Peptoid nanosheets have a very high surface area, which can be readily functionalized to serve as a platform for sensing and templating.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier, G.K.; Cho, A.; Sanii, B.; Connolly, M.D.; Tran, H.; Zuckermann, R.N. "Antibody-mimetic peptoid nanosheets for molecular recognition" ACS Nano. 7, 9276-9386, (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Also, their hydrophobic interiors can accommodate hydrophobic small molecule cargos, which have been demonstrated by the sequestration of [[Nile red]] when this dye was injected into an aqueous solution of the peptoid nanosheets.&lt;ref&gt;Tran, H., Gael, S.L., Connolly, M.D., Zuckermann, R.N. “Solid-phase submonomer synthesis of peptoid polymers and their self-assemble into highly-ordered nanosheets” J. Vis. Exp. 57, e3373, (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  For these reasons, the hydrophobic interior of the 2D nanosheets could be an attractive platform for loading or embedding hydrophobic cargo, such as drug molecules, [[fluorophores]], [[aromatic]] compounds, and metal [[nanoparticles]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="860">'''Picratol''' is a [[high explosive]] mixture, comprising 52% '[[ammonium picrate|Explosive D]]' and 48% [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. It has a [[detonation velocity]] of approximately 6,972 metres per second. Picratol has no civilian applications. It was exclusively intended for military use and was especially popular during the [[Second World War]]. The basic advantage of Picratol is its insensitivity to shock. As a result, it proved useful as the main explosive filling in [[armour-piercing]] shells and aerial bombs.

Picratol is an [[obsolete]] explosive and is therefore unlikely to be encountered, except in the form of legacy munitions and [[unexploded ordnance]].

While [[geostrophic motion]] refers to the wind that would result from an exact balance between the [[Coriolis force]] and horizontal [[pressure-gradient force]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, N.A. (1963). “Geostrophic Motion.” Reviews of Geophysics Volume 1, No. 2., p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; '''quasi-geostrophic (QG) motion''' refers to flows where the Coriolis force and pressure gradient forces are ''almost'' in balance, but with [[inertia]] also having an effect. 
&lt;ref&gt;Kundu, P.K. and Cohen, I.M. (2008). Fluid Mechanics, 4th edition. Elsevier., p. 658.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Atmospheric and oceanographic flows take place over horizontal length scales which are very large compared to their vertical length scale, and so they can be described using the [[shallow water equations]]. The [[Rossby number]] is a [[dimensionless number]] which characterises the strength of inertia compared to the strength of the Coriolis force. The quasi-geostrophic equations are approximations to the shallow water equations in the limit of small Rossby number, so that inertial forces are an [[order of magnitude]] smaller than the Coriolis and pressure forces. If the Rossby number is equal to zero then we recover geostrophic flow.

The quasi-geostrophic equations were first formulated by [[Jule Charney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Majda|first1=Andrew|last2=Wang|first2=Xiaoming|title=Nonlinear Dynamics and Statistical Theories for Basic Geophysical Flows|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3rBY0tnGa0C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivation of the single-layer QG equations ==

In Cartesian coordinates, the components of the [[geostrophic wind]] are
: &lt;math&gt; {f_0} {v_g} = {\partial \Phi \over \partial x}&lt;/math&gt; (1a)
: &lt;math&gt; {f_0} {u_g} = - {\partial \Phi \over \partial y}&lt;/math&gt; (1b)
where &lt;math&gt; {\Phi} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[geopotential]].

The geostrophic vorticity
: &lt;math&gt; {\zeta_g} = {\hat{k} \cdot \nabla \times \overrightarrow{V_g}}&lt;/math&gt;

can therefore be expressed in terms of the geopotential as

: &lt;math&gt; {\zeta_g} = {{\partial v_g \over \partial x} - {\partial u_g \over \partial y} = {1 \over f_0} \left({ {\partial^2 \Phi \over \partial x^2} + {\partial^2 \Phi \over \partial y^2}}\right) = {1 \over f_0}{\nabla^2 \Phi}} &lt;/math&gt; (2)

Equation (2) can be used to find &lt;math&gt;{\zeta_g (x,y)}&lt;/math&gt; from a known field &lt;math&gt;{\Phi (x,y)}&lt;/math&gt;.  Alternatively, it can also be used to determine &lt;math&gt;{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; from a known distribution of &lt;math&gt;{\zeta_g}&lt;/math&gt; by inverting the [[Laplacian]] operator.

The quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation can be obtained from the &lt;math&gt;{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{y}&lt;/math&gt; components of the quasi-geostrophic momentum equation which can then be derived from the horizontal momentum equation

: &lt;math&gt;{D\overrightarrow{V} \over Dt} + f \hat{k} \times \overrightarrow{V} = - \nabla \Phi&lt;/math&gt; (3)

&lt;br /&gt;
The [[material derivative]] in (3) is defined by

: &lt;math&gt; {{D \over Dt} = {\left({\partial \over \partial t}\right)_p} + {\left({\overrightarrow{V} \cdot \nabla}\right)_p} + {\omega {\partial \over \partial p}}} &lt;/math&gt; (4)  
:where &lt;math&gt; {\omega = {Dp \over Dt}} &lt;/math&gt; is the pressure change following the motion.

The horizontal velocity &lt;math&gt; {\overrightarrow{V}} &lt;/math&gt; can be separated into a geostrophic &lt;math&gt;{\overrightarrow{V_g}}&lt;/math&gt; and an [[Ageostrophy|ageostrophic]] &lt;math&gt; {\overrightarrow{V_a}} &lt;/math&gt; part

: &lt;math&gt; {\overrightarrow{V} = \overrightarrow{V_g} + \overrightarrow{V_a}} &lt;/math&gt; (5)

&lt;br /&gt;
Two important assumptions of the quasi-geostrophic approximation are

:: 1. &lt;math&gt;{\overrightarrow{V_g} \gg \overrightarrow{V_a} }&lt;/math&gt;, or, more precisely &lt;math&gt;{{|\overrightarrow{V_a}| \over  |\overrightarrow{V_g}|}} \sim O(\text{Rossby number})&lt;/math&gt;.
:: 2. the [[beta-plane approximation]] &lt;math&gt;{f = f_0 + \beta y}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\beta y}{f_0} \sim O(\text{Rossby number})}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The second assumption justifies letting the Coriolis parameter have a constant value &lt;math&gt;{f_0}&lt;/math&gt; in the geostrophic approximation and approximating its variation in the Coriolis force term by &lt;math&gt;{f_0 + \beta y}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Holton, J.R. (2004). Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology, 4th Edition. Elsevier., p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because the acceleration following the motion, which is given in (1) as the difference between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, depends on the departure of the actual wind from the geostrophic wind, it is not permissible to simply replace the velocity by its geostrophic velocity in the Coriolis term.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  The acceleration in (3) can then be rewritten as

: &lt;math&gt;{f \hat{k} \times \overrightarrow{V} + \nabla \Phi} = {(f_0 + \beta y)\hat{k} \times (\overrightarrow{V_g} + \overrightarrow{V_a}) - f_0 \hat{k} \times \overrightarrow{V_g}} = {f_0 \hat{k} \times \overrightarrow{V_a} + \beta y \hat{k} \times \overrightarrow{V_g} } &lt;/math&gt; (6)

&lt;br /&gt;
The approximate horizontal momentum equation thus has the form

: &lt;math&gt;{D_g \overrightarrow{V_g} \over Dt} = {-f_0 \hat{k} \times \overrightarrow{V_a} - \beta y \hat{k} \times \overrightarrow{V_g}}&lt;/math&gt; (7)

&lt;br /&gt;
Expressing equation (7) in terms of its components,

: &lt;math&gt;{{D_g u_g \over Dt} - {f_0 v_a} - {\beta y v_g} = 0}&lt;/math&gt; (8a)

: &lt;math&gt;{{D_g v_g \over Dt} + {f_0 u_a} + {\beta y u_g} = 0}&lt;/math&gt; (8b)

&lt;br /&gt;
Taking &lt;math&gt;{{\partial (8b) \over \partial x} - {\partial (8a) \over \partial y}}&lt;/math&gt;, and noting that geostrophic wind is nondivergent (i.e., &lt;math&gt;{\nabla \cdot \overrightarrow{V} = 0}&lt;/math&gt;), the vorticity equation is

: &lt;math&gt;{{D_g \zeta_g \over Dt} = f_0 \left ({{\partial u_a \over \partial x}+{\partial v_a \over \partial y}} \right) - \beta v_g }&lt;/math&gt; (9)

&lt;br /&gt;
Because &lt;math&gt;{f}&lt;/math&gt; depends only on &lt;math&gt;{y}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;{{D_g f \over Dt} = \overrightarrow{V_g} \cdot \nabla f = \beta v_g}&lt;/math&gt;) and that the divergence of the ageostrophic wind can be written in terms of &lt;math&gt;{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; based on the continuity equation

: &lt;math&gt;{{\partial u_a \over \partial x}+{\partial v_a \over \partial y}+{\partial \omega \over \partial p}=0}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
equation (9) can therefore be written as

: &lt;math&gt;{{\partial \zeta_g \over \partial t} = {-\overrightarrow{V_g} \cdot \nabla ({\zeta_g + f})} + {f_0 {\partial \omega \over \partial p}} }&lt;/math&gt; (10)

&lt;br /&gt;

===The same identity using the geopotential===

Defining the geopotential tendency &lt;math&gt;{\chi = {\partial \Phi \over \partial t}}&lt;/math&gt; and noting that partial differentiation may be reversed, equation (10) can be rewritten in terms of &lt;math&gt;{\chi}&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt;{{1 \over f_0}{\nabla^2 \chi} = {-\overrightarrow{V_g} \cdot \nabla \left({{1 \over f_0}{\nabla^2 \chi} + f} \right)} + {f_0 {\partial \omega \over \partial p}}}&lt;/math&gt; (11)

&lt;br /&gt;
The right-hand side of equation (11) depends on variables &lt;math&gt;{\chi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;.  An analogous equation dependent on these two variables can be derived from the thermodynamic energy equation

: &lt;math&gt;{{{ \left ({{\partial \over \partial t} + {\overrightarrow{V_g} \cdot \nabla}} \right) \left({-\partial \Phi \over \partial p} \right)}-\sigma \omega}={kJ \over p}}&lt;/math&gt; (12)

&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{\sigma = {-R T_0 \over p}{d \log \Theta_0 \over dp}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\Theta_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the potential temperature corresponding to the basic state temperature.  In the midtroposphere, &lt;math&gt;{\Theta_0}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ &lt;math&gt;{2.5 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{m}{^2}\mathrm{Pa}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;
Multiplying (12) by &lt;math&gt;{f_0 \over \sigma}&lt;/math&gt; and differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt;{p}&lt;/math&gt; and using the definition of &lt;math&gt;{\chi}&lt;/math&gt; yields

: &lt;math&gt;{{{\partial \over \partial p} \left ({{f_0 \over \sigma}{\partial \chi \over \partial p}} \right )}=-{{\partial \over \partial p}\left({{f_0 \over \sigma}{\overrightarrow{V_g} \cdot \nabla}{\partial \Phi \over \partial p}}\right)}-{{f_0}{\partial \omega \over \partial p}}-{{f_0}{\partial \over \partial p}\left({kJ \over \sigma p}\right)}}&lt;/math&gt; (13)

&lt;br /&gt;
If for simplicity &lt;math&gt;{J}&lt;/math&gt; were set to 0, eliminating &lt;math&gt;{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; in equations (11) and (13) yields &lt;ref&gt;Holton, J.R. (2004). Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology, 4th Edition. Elsevier., p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{{ \left({\nabla^2 + {{\partial \over \partial p} \left({{f_0^2 \over \sigma}{\partial \over \partial p}}\right)}}\right){\chi}}=-{{f_0}{\overrightarrow{V_g} \cdot \nabla}\left({{{1 \over f_0}{\nabla^2 \Phi}}+f}\right)}-{{\partial \over \partial p}\left({{-}{f_0^2 \over \sigma}{\overrightarrow{V_g} \cdot \nabla}\left({\partial \Phi \over \partial p}\right)}\right)}}&lt;/math&gt; (14)

&lt;br /&gt;
Equation (14) is often referred to as the ''geopotential tendency equation''.  It relates the local geopotential tendency (term A) to the vorticity advection distribution (term B) and thickness advection (term C).

===The same identity using the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity===


Using the chain rule of differentiation, term C can be written as

: &lt;math&gt;{-{{\overrightarrow{V_g} \cdot \nabla}{\partial \over \partial p}\left({{f_0^2 \over \sigma}{\partial \Phi \over \partial p}}\right)}-{{f_0^2 \over \sigma}{\partial \overrightarrow{V_g} \over \partial p}{\cdot \nabla}{\partial \Phi \over \partial p}}}&lt;/math&gt; (15)

&lt;br /&gt;
But based on the [[thermal wind]] relation,

: &lt;math&gt;{{f_0{\partial \overrightarrow{V_g} \over \partial p}}={\hat{k} \times \nabla \left({\partial \Phi \over \partial p} \right)}}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;
In other words,&lt;math&gt;{\partial \overrightarrow{V_g} \over \partial p}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;{\nabla ({\partial \Phi \over \partial p})}&lt;/math&gt; and the second term in equation (15) disappears. 

The first term can be combined with term B in equation (14) which, upon division by  &lt;math&gt;{f_0}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the form of a conservation equation &lt;ref&gt;Holton, J.R. (2004). Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology, 4th Edition. Elsevier., p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{{\left({{\partial \over \partial t}+{\overrightarrow{V_g} \cdot \nabla}}\right)q}={D_g q \over Dt}=0}&lt;/math&gt; (16)

&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{q}&lt;/math&gt; is the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity defined by

: &lt;math&gt;{q = {{{1 \over f_0}{\nabla^2 \Phi}}+{f}+{{\partial \over \partial p}\left({{f_0 \over \sigma}{\partial \Phi \over \partial p}}\right)}}}&lt;/math&gt; (17)

&lt;br /&gt;
The three terms of equation (17) are, from left to right, the geostrophic ''relative'' vorticity, the ''planetary'' vorticity and the ''stretching'' vorticity.

== Implications ==

As an air parcel moves about in the atmosphere, its relative, planetary and stretching vorticities may change but equation (17) shows that the sum of the three must be conserved following the geostrophic motion.

Equation (17) can be used to find &lt;math&gt;{q}&lt;/math&gt; from a known field &lt;math&gt;{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;.  Alternatively, it can also be used to predict the evolution of the geopotential field given an initial distribution of &lt;math&gt;{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; and suitable boundary conditions by using an inversion process.

More importantly, the quasi-geostrophic system reduces the five-variable primitive equations to a one-equation system where all variables such as &lt;math&gt;{u_g}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{v_g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{T}&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from &lt;math&gt;{q}&lt;/math&gt; or height &lt;math&gt;{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, because &lt;math&gt;{\zeta_g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\overrightarrow{V_g}}&lt;/math&gt; are both defined in terms of &lt;math&gt;{\Phi(x,y,p,t)}&lt;/math&gt;, the vorticity equation can be used to diagnose [[Q-Vectors|vertical motion]] provided that the fields of both &lt;math&gt;{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\partial \Phi \over \partial t}&lt;/math&gt; are known.

[[Snowstorms]] organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. [[Snowflake]]s [[Nucleation|nucleate]] around particles in the atmosphere by attracting [[supercooling|supercooled]] water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and [[Hard rime|rime]]. As snow accumulates into a [[snowpack]], it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by [[sintering]], [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] and [[freeze-thaw]]. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a [[glacier]] may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging [[groundwater]].

Major snow-prone areas include the [[Polar regions of Earth|polar regions]], the upper half of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and mountainous regions worldwide with sufficient moisture and cold temperatures. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], snow is confined primarily to mountainous areas, apart from [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;

Snow affects such human activities as [[transportation]]: creating the need for keeping roadways, wings, and windows clear; [[agriculture]]: providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock; [[sport]]s such as [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]], and [[Snowmobile|snowmachine]] travel; and [[warfare]]. Snow affects [[ecosystem]]s, as well, by providing an insulating layer during winter under which plants and animals are able to survive the cold.&lt;ref name=Snowenclyclopedia&gt;{{Citation

Snow develops in clouds that themselves are part of a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.&lt;ref name = Classificationonground/&gt;

===Cloud formation===
Snow clouds usually occur in the context of larger weather systems, the most important of which is the low pressure area, which typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their circulation. Two additional and locally productive sources of snow are lake-effect (also sea-effect) storms and elevation effects, especially in mountains.

====Low pressure areas====
{{Main article|Extratropical cyclone}}
[[File:Feb242007 blizzard.gif|thumb|right|Extratropical cyclonic snowstorm, February 24, 2007—(Click for animation.)]]

[[Extratropical cyclone|Mid-latitude cyclones]] are [[Low-pressure area|low pressure areas]] which are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild [[Winter storm#Snow|snow storms]] to heavy [[blizzard]]s.&lt;ref name="ExtraLessonMillUni"&gt;{{cite web| title = ESCI 241&amp;nbsp;– Meteorology; Lesson 16&amp;nbsp;– Extratropical Cyclones | author =  DeCaria| publisher = Department of Earth Sciences, [[Millersville University]]| date = December 7, 2005| url = http://www.atmos.millersville.edu/~adecaria/ESCI241/esci241_lesson16_cyclones.html | accessdate = June 21, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080208224320/http://www.atmos.millersville.edu/~adecaria/ESCI241/esci241_lesson16_cyclones.html |archivedate = February 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During a hemisphere's [[autumn|fall]], winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the [[troposphere]] to cause snowfall. In the Northern Hemisphere, the northern side of the low pressure area produces the most snow.&lt;ref&gt;

====Fronts====
{{Main article|Weather front}}
[[File:Snowsquall line-Bourrasque neige frontal NOAA.png|thumb|right|Frontal snowsquall moving toward [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]]]
A [[cold front]], the leading edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce [[Snowsquall#Frontal snowsquall|frontal snowsqualls]]—an intense frontal [[convective]] line (similar to a [[rainband]]), when [[temperature]] is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow.&lt;ref name=EC-2&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed [[thundersnow]].

A [[warm front]] can produce snow for a period, as warm, moist air overrides below-freezing air and creates precipitation at the boundary. Often, snow transitions to rain in the warm sector behind the front.&lt;ref name=EC-2/&gt;

Lake-effect snow is produced during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer [[lake]] water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up [[water vapor]] from the lake, rises up through the colder air above, freezes and is deposited on the [[leeward]] (downwind) shores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/features/02_monitoring/lakesnow.html|title=NOAA - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - Monitoring &amp; Understanding Our Changing Planet|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102173430/http://www.noaa.gov/features/02_monitoring/lakesnow.html|archivedate=January 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld012.htm |title=Fetch |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515101954/http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld012.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same effect also occurs over bodies of salt water, when it is termed ''ocean-effect'' or ''bay-effect snow''.  The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the [[orographic lift|orographic]] influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores. This uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation, which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour, often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall.&lt;ref name=mass&gt;{{cite book |last= Mass |first= Cliff |title= The Weather of the Pacific Northwest |year= 2008 |publisher= [[University of Washington Press]] |isbn= 978-0-295-98847-4 |page= 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The areas affected by lake-effect snow are called [[snowbelt]]s.  These include areas east of the [[Great Lakes]], the west coasts of northern Japan, the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in Russia, and areas near the [[Great Salt Lake]], [[Black Sea]], [[Caspian Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]], and parts of the northern Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name="SCHMID"&gt;Thomas W.

====Mountain effects====
{{Main article|Precipitation types#Orographic}}
[[Orography|Orographic]] or relief snowfall is caused when masses of air pushed by [[wind]] are forced up the side of elevated land formations, such as large [[mountain]]s. The lifting of air up the side of a mountain or range results in [[Adiabatic lapse rate|adiabatic]] cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving [[Foehn wind|drier, warmer air]] on the descending, leeward side.&lt;ref name="MT"&gt;Physical Geography.

A snowflake consists of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; water [[molecule]]s, which are added to its core at different rates and in different patterns, depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through on its way to the ground.

Snow crystals form when tiny [[supercool]]ed cloud droplets (about 10&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] in diameter) [[freezing|freeze]]. These droplets are able to remain liquid at temperatures lower than {{convert|-18|°C|°F|0}}, because to freeze, a few molecules in the droplet need to get together by chance to form an arrangement similar to that in an ice lattice. Then the droplet freezes around this "nucleus". In warmer clouds an aerosol particle or "ice nucleus" must be present in (or in contact with) the droplet to act as a nucleus. Ice nuclei are very rare compared to that cloud condensation nuclei on which liquid droplets form. Clays, desert dust and biological particles can be nuclei.&lt;ref name=Christner2008&gt;{{cite journal

Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the supersaturated environment—one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of [[micrometer]]s or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets by the [[Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process]]. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.&lt;ref name="natgeojan07"&gt;{{cite journal|author=M.

As Nakaya discovered, shape is also a function of whether the prevalent moisture is above or below saturation. Forms below the saturation line trend more towards solid and compact. Crystals formed in supersaturated air trend more towards lacy, delicate and ornate. Many more complex growth patterns also form such as side-planes, bullet-rosettes and also planar types depending on the conditions and ice nuclei.&lt;ref name=BaileyHallett&gt;{{cite journal

==Metamorphosis==
[[File:Sparkling-snow.crystals.jpg|thumb|Fresh snow beginning to metamorphose: The surface shows wind packing and [[sastrugi]]. In the foreground are [[hoar frost]] crystals, formed by refrozen water vapor emerging to the cold surface.]]
After deposition, snow progresses on one of two paths that determine its fate, either ''ablation'' (mostly by melting) or transitioning from [[firn]] (multi-year snow) into ''glacier ice''. During this transition, snow "is a highly porous, sintered material made up of a continuous ice structure and a continuously connected pore space, forming together the snow microstructure". Almost always near its melting temperature, a snowpack is continually transforming these properties in a process, known as ''metamorphism'', wherein all three phases of water may coexist, including liquid water partially filling the pore space.&lt;ref name = Classificationonground/&gt; Starting as a powdery deposition, snow becomes more granular when it begins to compact under its own weight, be blown by the wind, sinter particles together and commence the cycle of melting and refreezing. Water vapor plays a role as it deposits ice crystals, known as [[hoar frost]], during cold, still conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0Bpscs7Gqb8C&amp;pg=PA71|title=The Avalanche Handbook|author1=David McClung  |author2=Peter Schaerer |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=49–51|isbn=978-0-89886-809-8|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|year=2006|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasonal snowpack===
{{Main article|Snowpack|Névé}}
Over the course of time, a snowpack may settle under its own weight until its density is approximately 30% of water. Increases in density above this initial compression occur primarily by melting and refreezing, caused by temperatures above freezing or by direct solar radiation. In colder climates, snow lies on the ground all winter. By late spring, snow densities typically reach a maximum of 50% of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdec.water.ca.gov/snow/misc/density.html|author=California Data Exchange Center|publisher=Department of Water Resources California|title=Depth and Density|year=2007|accessdate=July 8, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713000814/http://cdec.water.ca.gov/snow/misc/density.html|archivedate=July 13, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snow that persists into summer evolves into [[névé]], granular snow, which has been partially melted, refrozen and compacted. Névé has a minimum [[density]] of {{convert|500|kg/m3|lb/ft3}}, which is [[Density#Water|roughly half]] of the density of liquid water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Firn|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=firn1|year=2009|accessdate=June 30, 2009|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824054449/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=firn1|archivedate=August 24, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firn===
{{Main article|Firn}}
[[File:Firn field on the top of Säuleck.jpg|thumb|right|[[Firn]]—metamorphosed multi-year snow]]
Firn is snow that has persisted for multiple years and has been [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallized]] into a substance denser than [[névé]], yet less dense and hard than glacial [[ice]]. Firn resembles caked sugar and is very resistant to shovelling. Its density generally ranges from {{convert|550|kg/m3|lb/ft3}} to {{convert|830|kg/m3|lb/ft3}}, and it can often be found underneath the snow that accumulates at the head of a [[glacier]]. The minimum altitude that firn accumulates on a glacier is called the ''firn limit'', ''firn line'' or ''snowline''.&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Glacialprocess&gt;

==Movement==
There are four main mechanisms for movement of deposited snow: ''drifting'' of unsintered snow, ''avalanches'' of accumulated snow on steep slopes, ''snowmelt'' during thaw conditions, and the ''movement of glaciers'' after snow has persisted for multiple years and metamorphosed into glacier ice.

===Drifting===
[[File:Long Mynd snowdrift.jpeg|thumb|right|Snow drifts forming around downwind obstructions]]
When powdery, snow drifts with the [[wind]] from the location where it originally fell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cocorahs.org/media/docs/KS/CoCoRaHS%20Snow.PDF|title=CoCoRaHS in the Cold – Measuring in Snowy Weather|publisher=Colorado Climate Center|author=Joy Haden|date=February 8, 2005|accessdate=July 12, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172302/http://www.cocorahs.org/media/docs/KS/CoCoRaHS%20Snow.PDF|archivedate=July 18, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming deposits with a depth of several meters in isolated locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/weather/4434935/Snow-Britain-Snow-drifts-and-blizzards-of-the-past.html|title=Snow Britain: Snow drifts and blizzards of the past|author=Caroline Gammel|date=February 2, 2009|accessdate=July 12, 2009|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205075802/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/weather/4434935/Snow-Britain-Snow-drifts-and-blizzards-of-the-past.html|archivedate=February 5, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attaching to hillsides, blown snow can evolve into a snow slab, which is an avalanche hazard on steep slopes.&lt;ref name="McClung 2006"/&gt;

===Avalanche===
{{Main article|Avalanche}}
[[File:2007-02-15-CLB-Couloir2-1c.JPG|thumb|A powder snow avalanche]]
An avalanche (also called a snowslide or snowslip) is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they [[Entrainment (physical geography)|entrain]] more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of [[gravity current]]. They occur in three major mechanisms:&lt;ref name="McClung 2006"&gt;McClung, David and Shaerer, Peter: The Avalanche Handbook, The Mountaineers: 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-89886-809-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Slab avalanches'' occur in snow that has been deposited, or redeposited by wind. They have the characteristic appearance of a block (slab) of snow cut out from its surroundings by fractures. These account for most back-country fatalities.
* ''[[Powder snow avalanche]]s'' result from a deposition of fresh dry powder and generate a powder cloud, which overlies a dense avalanche. They can exceed speeds of {{convert|300|kph}}, and masses of {{convert|10000000|tonnes}}; their flows can travel long distances along flat valley bottoms and even uphill for short distances.
* ''Wet snow avalanches'' are a low-velocity suspension of snow and water, with the flow confined to the surface of the pathway.&lt;ref name="McClung 2006"/&gt; The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~{{convert|10|to|40|km/h|0}}), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.

===Snowmelt===
[[File:1997 Red River Flood Grand Forks.jpg|thumb|right|Snowmelt-induced flooding of the [[Red River of the North]] in [[1997 Red River flood|1997]]]]
Many rivers originating in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive a significant portion of their flow from snowmelt. This often makes the river's flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic [[flooding]]&lt;ref name="Howard Perlman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclesnowmelt.html|title=The Water Cycle: Snowmelt Runoff|author=Howard Perlman|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=May 13, 2009|accessdate=July 7, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813020946/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclesnowmelt.html|archivedate=August 13, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the spring months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain West of the US or most of [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]], very low flow for the rest of the year. In contrast, if much of the melt is from [[glaciated]] or nearly glaciated areas, the melt continues through the warm season, with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watershed.ucdavis.edu/copper_river/background/data/BowersoxCopper.pdf|title=Hydrology of a Glacial Dominated System, Copper River, Alaska|author=Randy Bowersox|page=2|accessdate=July 8, 2009|date=June 20, 2002|publisher=[[University of California]]-Davis|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612005951/http://watershed.ucdavis.edu/copper_river/background/data/BowersoxCopper.pdf|archivedate=June 12, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glaciers===
{{Main article|Glacier}}
Glaciers form where the accumulation of snow and ice exceeds ablation. The area in which an alpine glacier forms is called a cirque (corrie or cwm), a typically armchair-shaped geological feature, which collects snow and where the snowpack compacts under the weight of successive layers of accumulating snow, forming névé. Further crushing of the individual snow crystals and reduction of entrapped air in the snow turns it into 'glacial ice'. This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it 'overflows' through a geological weakness or vacancy, such as the gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure.  On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15&amp;nbsp;m (50&amp;nbsp;ft) of snow-ice.&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

==Snow science==
{{Main article|Snow science}}
Scientists study snow at a wide variety of scales that include the [[physics]] of [[chemical bonds]] and [[Cloud physics|clouds]]; the distribution, accumulation, metamorphosis, and ablation of snowpacks; and the contribution of snowmelt to river [[hydraulics]] and ground [[hydrology]]. In doing so, they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied. Their findings contribute to knowledge applied by [[engineer]]s, who adapt vehicles and structures to snow, by [[agronomist]]s, who address the availability of snowmelt to [[agriculture]], and those, who design equipment for sporting activities on snow. Scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging from the individual crystal to the aggregated snowpack. A sub-specialty is [[avalanche]]s, which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people, alike.

Snow science addresses how snow forms, its distribution, and processes affecting how snowpacks change over time. Scientists improve storm forecasting, study global snow cover and its effect on climate, glaciers, and water supplies around the world. The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover. In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish [[ground truth]] and [[remote sensing]] techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.&lt;ref&gt;

===Measurement and classification===
In the field snow scientists often excavate a snow pit within which to make basic measurements and observations. Observations can describe features caused by wind, water percolation, or snow unloading from trees.Water percolation into a snowpack can create flow fingers and ponding or flow along capillary barriers, which can refreeze into horizontal and vertical solid ice formations within the snowpack. Among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks that the ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' includes are: snow height, snow water equivalent, snow strength, and extent of snow cover. Each has a designation with code and detailed description. The classification extends the prior classifications of Nakaya and his successors to related types of precipitation and are quoted in the following table:&lt;ref name = Classificationonground/&gt;

''All are formed in cloud, except for rime, which forms on objects exposed to supercooled moisture.''

It also has a more extensive classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack and the formation of ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.&lt;ref name=Classificationonground&gt;

===Satellite data===
[[Remote sensing]] of snowpacks with satellites and other platforms typically includes multi-spectral collection of imagery. Multi-faceted interpretation of the data obtained allows inferences about what is observed. The science behind these remote observations has been verified with ground-truth studies of the actual conditions.&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

Satellite observations record a decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellites when satellite observations began. In some areas, including China, snow cover has increased. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover has been observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less coverage area. However, in some areas there may be an increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40°. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.&lt;ref name = Review&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dietz, A. |author2=Kuenzer, C. |author3=Gessner, U. |author4= Dech, S.  | year=2012 |title=Remote Sensing of Snow – a Review of available methods |journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing |doi=10.1080/01431161.2011.640964|bibcode = 2012IJRS...33.4094D |volume=33 |pages=4094–4134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most frequently used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, which has led to other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, it is important to have continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.&lt;ref name = Review/&gt;

===Models===
[[File:Watercyclesummary.jpg|thumb|Snowfall and snowmelt are parts of the Earth's water cycle.]]
Snow science often leads to predictive models that include snow deposition, snow melt, and snow hydrology—elements of the Earth's [[water cycle]]—which help describe [[global climate change]].&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

[[Climate model|Global climate change models]] (GCMs) incorporate snow as a factor in their calculations. Some important aspects of snow cover include its [[albedo]] (reflectivity of incident radiation, including light) and insulating qualities, which slow the rate of seasonal melting of sea ice. As of 2011, the melt phase of GCM snow models were thought to perform poorly in regions with complex factors that regulate snow melt, such as vegetation cover and terrain. These models typically derive snow water equivalent (SWE) in some manner from satellite observations of snow cover.&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt; The ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' defines SWE as "the depth of water that would result if the mass of snow melted completely".&lt;ref name = Classificationonground/&gt;

Given the importance of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between the air and the snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute ''Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to ''Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

==Effects on human activity==
Snow affects human activity in four major areas, transportation, agriculture, structures, and sports. Most transportation modes are impeded by snow on the travel surface. Agriculture often relies on snow as a source of seasonal moisture. Structures may fail under snow loads. Humans find a wide variety of recreational activities in snowy landscapes.

===Transportation===
{{See also|Snowplow}}
Snow affects the rights of way of highways, airfields and railroads. They share a common tool for clearing snow, the [[snowplow]]. However, the application is different in each case—whereas roadways employ anti-icing chemicals to prevent bonding of ice, airfields may not; railroads rely on abrasives to enhance traction on tracks.

In the late 20th century, an estimated $2 billion was spent annually in North America on roadway winter maintenance, owing to snow and other winter weather events, according to a 1994 report by Kuemmel. The study surveyed the practices of jurisdictions within 44 US states and nine Canadian provinces. It assessed the policies, practices, and equipment used for winter maintenance. It found similar practices and progress to be prevalent in Europe.&lt;ref name = Kuemmel/&gt;

The dominant effect of snow on vehicle contact with the road is diminished friction. This can be improved with the use of [[snow tire]]s, which have a tread designed to compact snow in a manner that enhances traction. However, the key to maintaining a roadway that can accommodate traffic during and after a snow event is an effective anti-icing program that employs both chemicals and [[Snowplow|plowing]].&lt;ref name = Kuemmel&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I3gxuwTE5_MC&amp;pg=PA10|title=Managing roadway snow and ice control operations|author=David A.

Key aspects of the practice include: understanding anti-icing in light of the level of service to be achieved on a given roadway, the climatic conditions to be encountered, and the different roles of deicing, anti-icing, and abrasive materials and applications, and employing anti-icing "toolboxes", one for operations, one for decision-making and another for personnel.

[[File:2008 aircraft deicing at gate.jpg|thumb|right|Deicing an aircraft during a snow event]]
In order to keep airports open during winter storms, runways and taxiways require snow removal. Unlike roadways, where chloride chemical treatment is common to prevent snow from bonding to the pavement surface, such chemicals are typically banned from airports because of their strong corrosive effect on aluminum aircraft. Consequently, mechanical brushes are often used to complement the action of snow plows. Given the width of runways on airfields that handle large aircraft, vehicles with large plow blades, an echelon of plow vehicles or [[rotary snowplow]]s are used to clear snow on runways and taxiways. Terminal aprons may require {{Convert|6|ha}} or more to be cleared.&lt;ref name=Vinson&gt;

====Rail====
Railroads have traditionally employed two types of snow plows for clearing track, the [[wedge plow]], which casts snow to both sides, and the rotary snowplow, which is suited for addressing heavy snowfall and casting snow far to one side or the other. Prior to the invention of the rotary snowplow ca. 1865, it required multiple [[locomotive]]s to drive a wedge plow through deep snow. Subsequent to clearing the track with such plows, a "flanger" is used to clear snow from between the rails that are below the reach of the other types of plow. Where icing may affect the steel-to-steel contact of locomotive wheels on track, abrasives (typically sand) have been used to provide traction on steeper uphills.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both standards employ methods that translate maximum expected ground snow loads onto design loads for roofs.

====Roofs====
[[File:Ice dam and roof leakage.jpg|thumb|right|Icings resulting from meltwater at the bottom of the snow pack on the roof, flowing and refreezing at the eave as icicles and from leaking into the wall via an ice dam.]]
Snow loads and icings are two principal issues for roofs. Snow loads are related to the climate in which a structure is sited. Icings are usually a result of the building or structure generating heat that melts the snow that is on it.

''Snow loads'' – The ''Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures'' gives guidance on how to translate the following factors into roof snow loads:&lt;ref name = ASCE7/&gt;
* Ground snow loads
* Exposure of the roof
* Thermal properties of the roof
* Shape of the roof
* Drifting

It gives tables for ground snow loads by region and a methodology for computing ground snow loads that may vary with elevation from nearby, measured values. The ''Eurocode 1'' uses similar methodologies, starting with ground snow loads that are tabulated for portions of Europe.&lt;ref name=Eurocode1/&gt;

''Icings'' – Roofs must also be designed to avoid [[Ice dam (roof)|ice dams]], which result from meltwater running under the snow on the roof and freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the [[eaves]]. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam.&lt;ref name="Paul" &gt;Paul Fisette, "Preventing Ice Dams", ''Roofing, flashing &amp; waterproofing''. Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 2005. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Ice dams may result in [[Water damage|damaged]] building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.state.mn.us/portal/mn/jsp/content.do?test=y&amp;id=-536881350&amp;subchannel=-536881511&amp;sc2=null&amp;sc3=null&amp;contentid=536884951&amp;contenttype=EDITORIAL&amp;programid=536886479&amp;agency=Commerce|title=Ice Dams|publisher=Minnesota Department of Commerce|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824154322/http://www.state.mn.us/portal/mn/jsp/content.do?test=y&amp;id=-536881350&amp;subchannel=-536881511&amp;sc2=null&amp;sc3=null&amp;contentid=536884951&amp;contenttype=EDITORIAL&amp;programid=536886479&amp;agency=Commerce| archivedate=August 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen" &gt;

===Sports and recreation===
[[File:Ski Famille - Family Ski Holidays.jpg|thumb|Alpine skiing.]]
{{Main article|Winter sport}}
Snow figures into many winter sports and forms of recreation, including [[skiing]] and [[sledding]]. Common examples include [[cross-country skiing]], [[Alpine skiing]], [[snowboarding]], [[snowshoe]]ing, and [[Snowmobile|snowmobiling]]. The design of the equipment used, typically relies on the bearing strength of snow, as with skis or snowboards and contends with the [[coefficient of friction]] of snow to allow sliding, often enhance by [[ski wax]]es.

Skiing is by far the largest form of winter recreation. As of 1994, of the estimated 65–75 million skiers worldwide, there were approximately 55 million who engaged in [[Alpine skiing]], the rest engaged in [[cross-country skiing]]. Approximately 30 million skiers (of all kinds) were in Europe, 15 million in the US, and 14 million in Japan. As of 1996, there were reportedly 4,500 ski areas, operating 26,000 ski lifts and enjoying 390 million skier visits per year. The preponderant region for downhill skiing was Europe, followed by Japan and the US.&lt;ref&gt;

Increasingly, ski resorts are relying on [[snowmaking]], the production of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a [[Snowmaking#Snowmaking guns|snow gun]] on ski slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number=2676471|inventor=W. M. Pierce Jr.|title=Method for Making and Distributing Snow|issue-date=December 14, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at [[ski resort]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/25/newsid_2786000/2786871.stm On This Day: March 25] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412010130/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/25/newsid_2786000/2786871.stm |date=April 12, 2011 }}, [[BBC News]], accessed December 20, 2006. "The first artificial snow was made two years later, in 1952, at Grossinger's resort in New York, USA. "&lt;/ref&gt; This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. [[Wet-bulb temperature]] is used as a metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://bachler.cms1.ch/Portals/41/docs/energy_usage_for_snowmaking.pdf|title=Energy usage for snowmaking|author=Jörgen Rogstam|author2=Mattias Dahlberg|last-author-amp=yes|date=April 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201200900/http://bachler.cms1.ch/Portals/41/docs/energy_usage_for_snowmaking.pdf|archivedate=February 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ski wax]] enhances the ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the properties of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.&lt;ref name="Bhavikatti"&gt;{{cite book

===Warfare===
{{main article|Cold-weather warfare}}
{{see also|Ski warfare}}
Snow affects warfare conducted in winter, alpine environments or at high latitudes. The main factors are ''impaired visibility'' for acquiring targets during falling snow, ''enhanced visibility'' of targets against snowy backgrounds for targeting, and mobility for both [[Mechanized infantry|mechanized]] and [[infantry]] troops. Snowfall can severely inhibit the [[Military logistics|logistics of supplying troops]], as well. Snow can also provide cover and fortification against small-arms fire.&lt;ref name=chew&gt;{{cite journal

==Effects on ecosystems==
[[File:Chlamydomonas nivalis.jpg|thumb|right|Algae, ''[[Chlamydomonas nivalis]]'', that thrive in snow form red areas in the [[Suncup (snow)|suncups]] on this snow surface]]
Both plant and animal life endemic to snow-bound areas develop ways to adapt. Among the adaptive mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.&lt;ref name = SnowEcology/&gt;

===Plant life===
Snow interacts with vegetation in two principal ways, vegetation can influence the deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of [[conifer]]s intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth is dependent on the departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

===Animal life===
[[File:Fjellrev - Arctic fox (24490250823).jpg|thumb|right|[[Arctic fox]], a predator of smaller animals that live beneath the snow]]
Snow supports a wide variety of animals both on the surface and beneath. Many [[invertebrate]]s thrive in snow, including [[spider]]s, [[wasp]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[snow scorpionfly]]s and [[springtail]]s. Such [[arthropod]]s are typically active at temperatures down to {{convert|-5|C}}. Invertebrates fall into two groups, regarding surviving subfreezing temperatures: freezing resistant and those that avoid freezing because they are freeze-sensitive. The first group may be cold hardy owing to the ability to produce [[antifreeze]] agents in their body fluids that allows survival of long exposure to sub-freezing conditions. Some organisms [[Fasting|fast]] during the winter, which expels freezing-sensitive contents from their digestive tracts. The ability to survive the absence of oxygen in ice is an additional survival mechanism.&lt;ref name = SnowEcology/&gt;

Small [[vertebrates]] are active beneath the snow. Among vertebrates, [[alpine salamander]]s are active in snow at temperatures as low as {{convert|-8|C}}; they burrow to the surface in springtime and lay their eggs in melt ponds. Among mammals, those that remain active are typically smaller than {{convert|250|g}}. [[Omnivore]]s are more likely to enter a torpor or be [[Hibernate|hibernators]], whereas [[herbivore]]s are more likely to maintain food caches beneath the snow. [[Vole]]s store up to {{convert|3|kg}} of food and [[pika]]s up to {{convert|20|kg}}. Voles also huddle in communal nests to benefit from one another's warmth. On the surface, [[wolves]], [[coyotes]], [[fox]]es, [[lynx]], and [[weasel]]s rely on these subsurface dwellers for food and often dive into the snowpack to find them.&lt;ref name = SnowEcology&gt;

== Extraterrestrial snow ==
Extraterrestrial "snow" includes water-based precipitation, but also precipitation of other compounds prevalent on other planets and moons in the [[Solar System]]. Examples are:
* On [[Mars]], observations of the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' Mars lander]] reveal that water-based snow crystals occur at high latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/07/090702-snow-mars-phoenix.html|title="Diamond Dust" Snow Falls Nightly on Mars|author=Anne Minard|date=July 2, 2009|publisher=[[National Geographic News]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917075510/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/07/090702-snow-mars-phoenix.html|archivedate=September 17, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[carbon dioxide]] precipitates from clouds during the Martian winters at the poles and contributes to a seasonal deposit of that compound, which is the principal component of that [[Martian polar ice caps|planet's ice caps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:06. Експерименти со стаклена инка.ogv|thumb|right|250px|An experiment with a glass funnel showing the action of [[vacuum]] on the ball caused by suction out of the funnel's stem. The ball is suspended and doesn't fall as long as there is suction.]]
'''Suction''' is the flow of a fluid into a partial [[vacuum]], or region of low pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tnuf0g6J5KEC&amp;pg=PA976&amp;dq=suction+is+flow+of+fluid+into+partial+vacuum+-pump&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyu9GZrcbUAhUBwmMKHUS1Cyw4ChDoAQg8MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=suction%20is%20flow%20of%20fluid%20into%20partial%20vacuum%20-pump&amp;f=false|title=A Dictionary of Mechanical Science, Arts, Manufactures and Miscellaneous Knowledge|last=(LL.D.)|first=Alexander JAMIESON|date=1827|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pressure gradient force|pressure gradient]] between this region and the ambient pressure will propel matter toward the low pressure area. Dust is sucked into a [[vacuum cleaner]] when it is pushed in by the higher pressure air on the outside of the cleaner.

This is similar to what happens when humans breathe or drink through a [[drinking straw|straw]]. Both breathing and using a straw involve contracting the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and muscles around the rib cage. The increased volume in the chest cavity or thoracic cavity decreases the pressure inside, creating an imbalance with the ambient air pressure, or [[atmospheric pressure]]. This imbalance results in air pushing into the lungs or liquid pushing up through a straw and into the mouth.

==Pumps==
{{main|Pump}}
{{also|Suction pump}}
[[Pumps]] typically have an inlet where the fluid (or air) enters the pump and an outlet where the fluid/air comes out. The inlet location is said to be at the '''suction side''' of the pump. The outlet location is said to be at the '''discharge side''' of the pump. Operation of the pump creates suction (a lower pressure) at the suction side so that fluid/air can enter the pump through the inlet. Pump operation also causes higher pressure at the discharge side by forcing the fluid/air out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at the pump's suction and/or discharge sides which control the operation of the pump. For example, if the suction pressure of a [[centrifugal pump]] is too high, a device may trigger the fluid pump to shut off to keep it from running dry; i. e. with no fluid entering.

Under normal conditions of [[atmospheric pressure]] suction can draw pure water up to a maximum height of approximately 10.3 m (33.9 [[Foot (length)|feet]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Calvert|2000|loc="[http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/fluids/hydstat.htm#Maxh Maximum height to which water can be raised by a suction pump]"}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Suction (medicine)|In medicine, suction]] devices are used to clear airways of materials that would like to impede breathing or cause infections, to aid in surgery, and for other purposes.

'''Suspended solids''' refers to small solid particles which remain in [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] in water as a [[colloid]] or due to the motion of the water.&lt;ref&gt;http://in.grundfos.com/service-support/encyclopedia-search/suspended-solids.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as one indicator of [[water quality]].

It is sometimes abbreviated '''SS''', but is not to be confused with [[settling|settleable solids]], also abbreviated SS, which contribute to the blocking of [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] pipes.

==Explanation==
Suspended solids are important as [[pollutant]]s and [[pathogen]]s are carried on the surface of particles. The smaller the particle size, the greater the total surface area per unit mass of particle in grams, and so the higher the pollutant load that is likely to be carried.

==Removal==
Removal of suspended solids is generally achieved through the use of [[sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] and/or [[water filter]]s (usually at a municipal level). By eliminating most of the suspended solids in a water supply, the significant water is usually rendered close to drinking quality. This is followed by [[water disinfection|disinfection]] to ensure that any free floating pathogens, or pathogens associated with the small remaining amount of suspended solids, are rendered ineffective.

==Effectiveness of filtering==
The use of a very simple [[cloth filter]], consisting of a folded cotton [[sari]], drastically reduces the load of [[cholera]] carried in the water, and is suitable for use by the very poor; in this case, an [[appropriate technology]] method of disinfection might be added, such as [[solar water disinfection]].

A major exception to this generalization is [[arsenic contamination of groundwater]], as [[arsenic]] is a very serious pollutant which is soluble, and thus not removed when suspended solids are removed. This makes it very difficult to remove, and finding an alternative water source is often the most realistic option.

'''''Syriana''''' is a 2005 American [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] [[thriller film]] written and directed by [[Stephen Gaghan]], and executive produced by [[George Clooney]], who also stars in the film with an [[ensemble cast]]. Gaghan's screenplay is loosely [[Film adaptation|adapted]] from [[Robert Baer]]'s memoir ''[[See No Evil (book)|See No Evil]]''. The film focuses on [[petroleum politics]] and the global influence of the [[oil industry]], whose political, economic, legal, and social effects are experienced by a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operative ([[George Clooney]]), an energy analyst ([[Matt Damon]]), a [[Washington, D.C.]] attorney ([[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]), and a young unemployed [[Pakistani]] migrant worker ([[Mazhar Munir]]) in an [[Arab]] state in the Persian Gulf. The film also features an extensive supporting cast including [[Amanda Peet]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Mark Strong]], [[Alexander Siddig]], [[Amr Waked]], and [[Academy Award]] winners [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Chris Cooper]] and [[William Hurt]].

As with Gaghan's screenplay for ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'', ''Syriana'' uses multiple, parallel storylines, jumping between locations in [[Iran]], [[Texas]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Switzerland]], [[Spain]] and [[Lebanon]].

Clooney won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role as Bob Barnes, and Gaghan's script was nominated by the Academy for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. As of April 20, 2006, the film had grossed a total of $50.82 million at the U.S. box office and $42.9 million overseas, for a total of $93.73 million.

==Plot==
U.S. energy giant Connex Oil is losing control of key [[oil field]]s in a Persian Gulf kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The [[emirate]]'s [[foreign minister]], Prince Nasir, has granted [[natural gas]] drilling rights to a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and the U.S. government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in [[Kazakhstan]]. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] have concerns. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption.

===Emir storyline===
Bryan Woodman is an American energy analyst based in Geneva. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai, shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted.

In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth $75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir wants to utilize his nation's oil profits to diversify the economy and introduce democratic reforms, in sharp contrast to his father's repressive government, which has been supported by American interests. His father, at the urging of the American government, names the younger Meshal as his successor, causing Nasir to attempt a coup.

===Assassination storyline===
Bob Barnes is a veteran [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent trying to stop illegal arms trafficking in the [[Middle East]]. While on assignment in Tehran to kill two arms dealers, Barnes notices that one of two [[anti-aircraft missiles]] intended to be used in a bombing was diverted to an Egyptian, while the other explodes and kills the two arms dealers. The dealers are later revealed to be Iranian Intelligence agents. Barnes makes his superiors nervous by writing memos about the missile theft and is subsequently reassigned to a desk job. However, unaccustomed to the political discretion required, he quickly embarrasses the wrong people by speaking his mind and is sent back to the field with the assignment of assassinating Prince Nasir, whom the CIA identifies as being the financier behind the Egyptian's acquisition of the missile. Prior to his reassignment, Barnes confides in his ex-CIA agent friend, Stan Goff, that he will return to [[Lebanon]]. Goff advises him to clear his presence with [[Hezbollah]] so they know he is not acting against them. Barnes travels to Lebanon, obtains safe passage from a Hezbollah leader, and hires a mercenary named Mussawi to help kidnap and kill Nasir. But Mussawi has become an Iranian agent and has Barnes abducted. Mussawi tortures Barnes and prepares to behead him, but the Hezbollah leader arrives and stops him.

When the CIA learns that Mussawi plans to broadcast the agency's intention to kill Nasir, they set Barnes up as a scapegoat, portraying him as a rogue agent. Barnes's boss, Terry George, worries that Barnes might talk about the Nasir assassination plan and that killing Nasir with a drone would make it obvious as an American-backed assassination. He has Barnes's passports revoked, locks him out of his computer at work, and initiates an investigation of him. Barnes, however, learns from Goff that Whiting, working on behalf of a group of businessmen calling themselves The Committee to Liberate Iran, is responsible for Barnes's blackballing and the assassination, and threatens him and his family unless he halts the investigation and releases Barnes's passports.

Barnes returns to the Middle East and approaches Prince Nasir's convoy to warn him of the assassination plan. As he arrives, a guided bomb from a circling Predator drone strikes the automobile of Nasir and his family, killing them instantly. Woodman, having earlier offered his seat in Nasir's car to members of his family, survives the missile strike and goes home to his wife and son.

===Wasim storyline===
Pakistani migrant workers Saleem Ahmed Khan and his son Wasim board a bus to go to work at a Connex refinery, only to discover that they have been laid off. Since the company had provided food and lodging, the workers face the threat of poverty and deportation due to their unemployed status. Wasim desperately searches for work but is refused because he doesn't speak Arabic. Wasim and his friend join a madrasa to learn Arabic in order to improve their employment prospects. While playing soccer, they meet a charismatic cleric who eventually leads them to execute a suicide attack on a Connex-Killen tanker using an explosive from the missing Tehran missile.

===Merger storyline===
Bennett Holiday meets with Dean Whiting, who is convinced that Killen bribed someone to get the drilling rights in [[Kazakhstan]]. While investigating Connex-Killen's records, Holiday discovers a wire transfer of funds that leads back to a transaction between Texas oilman and Killen colleague Danny Dalton and Kazakh officials. Holiday tells Connex-Killen of his discovery, and they pretend not to have known about it. Holiday advises Dalton that he will likely be charged with corruption in order to serve as a "body" to get the DOJ off the back of the rest of Connex-Killen. [[U.S. Attorney]] Donald Farish III then strong-arms Holiday into giving the DOJ information about illegal activities he has discovered. Holiday gives up Dalton, but Farish says this is not enough. Holiday meets with the CEO of Killen Oil, Jimmy Pope, and informs him that the DOJ needs a second body in order to drop the investigation. Pope asks Holiday whether a person at Holiday's firm above him would be sufficient as the additional body. Holiday acknowledges that if the name were big enough, the DOJ would stop the investigation and allow the merger.

Holiday is brought by his colleague and mentor Sydney Hewitt to meet with the Chairman &amp; CEO of Connex Oil, Leland "Lee" Janus. Holiday reveals an under-the-table deal that Hewitt made while the Connex-Killen merger was being processed. Holiday has given Hewitt to the DOJ as the second body, thereby protecting the rest of Connex-Killen. Janus is able to accept the "Oil Industry Man of the Year" award with a load taken off his shoulders.

==Production==
While working on ''Traffic'', Stephen Gaghan began to see parallels between drug addiction and America's dependency on foreign oil.&lt;ref name= "Grady"&gt;{{cite news| last = Grady| first = Pam| coauthors =| title = ''Syriana'', Staccato Style| work = FilmStew| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = December 16, 2005| url = http://www.filmstew.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ContentID=12969| accessdate = 2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of inspiration came from 9/11 and Gaghan's lack of knowledge about the Middle East. He said, "When 9/11 happened, it suddenly was a war on terror, which I think of as a war on emotions. It all started to click for me."&lt;ref name="Nguyen"&gt;{{cite news| last = Nguyen| first = Ky N| coauthors = | title = Tracks of Terrorism| work = The Washington Diplomat| pages = | language = | publisher = | date = January 2006| url = http://www.washdiplomat.com/January%202006/b_filminter_01_06.html| accessdate = 2009-04-15| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110511150135/http://www.washdiplomat.com/January%202006/b_filminter_01_06.html| archivedate = 2011-05-11| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks after 9/11, [[Steven Soderbergh]] sent Gaghan a copy of ex-CIA officer Robert Baer's memoir, ''See No Evil''.&lt;ref name= "Halbfinger"&gt;{{cite news| last = Halbfinger| first = David M| coauthors =| title = Hollywood has a Hot New Agency| work = [[The New York Times]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = May 15, 2005| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/movies/15halb.html?_r=1&amp;scp=13&amp;sq=%22Syriana%22&amp;st=nyt| accessdate = 2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenwriter read the book and wanted to turn it into a film because it added another layer to the story that Gaghan wanted to tell.&lt;ref name="Grady"/&gt; Soderbergh bought the rights to ''See No Evil'' and negotiated the deal with [[Warner Bros.]]&lt;ref name= "Tyrangiel"&gt;{{cite news| last = Tyrangiel| first = Josh| coauthors =| title = So, You Ever Kill Anybody?| work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = November 13, 2005| url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1129565,00.html| accessdate = 2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaghan met Baer for lunch and then, for six weeks in 2002, the two men traveled from Washington to Geneva to the [[French Riviera]] to Lebanon, Syria and Dubai, meeting with lobbyists, arms dealers, oil traders, Arab officials and the spiritual leader of Hezbollah.&lt;ref name="Halbfinger"/&gt; Meeting Baer, Gaghan realized that the man had "gone out there and done and seen things that he was not allowed to talk about, and wouldn't, but he was angry about and also trying to make amends for."&lt;ref name="Halbfinger"/&gt; Before any filming took place, Gaghan convinced Warner Bros. to give him an unlimited research budget and no deadline.&lt;ref name="Tyrangiel"/&gt; He did his own legwork, meeting with oil traders in [[London, England|London]] and lawyers in Washington, D.C. Moments after arriving in Beirut in 2002, Gaghan was taken from the airport in a blindfold and hood where he met with Sheik [[Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah]], who was interested in films. He decided to grant the writer an audience even though he had not requested one. In addition, Gaghan dined with men suspected of killing former Lebanese Prime Minister [[Rafiq Hariri]] and met with former Defense Policy Board chairman [[Richard Perle]].&lt;ref name="Tyrangiel"/&gt;

Gaghan has cited as influences on ''Syriana'', European films like [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Rome, Open City]]'', [[Costa Gavras]]' ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'', and [[Gillo Pontecorvo]]'s ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]''.&lt;ref name= "Farber"&gt;{{cite news| last = Farber| first = Stephen| coauthors =| title = A Half-Dozen Ways to Watch the Same Movie| work = [[The New York Times]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = November 13, 2005| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/movies/13farb.html?scp=18&amp;sq=%22Syriana%22&amp;st=nyt| accessdate = 2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence, or resource—one that might also explain the movie's use of a documentary clip featuring [[John D. Rockefeller]]—is the fact that Gaghan's fashion-designer wife [[Minnie Mortimer]] is the great-granddaughter of onetime [[Standard Oil]] executive Henry Morgan Tilford.

[[Harrison Ford]] turned down the role of Bob Barnes (the role played by George Clooney), regretting it later, stating, "I didn't feel strongly enough about the truth of the material and I think I made a mistake."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2006/03/04/story247617.asp Harrison Ford: 'I should have been in Syriana'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110442/http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2006/03/04/story247617.asp |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second Stephen Gaghan-written role Ford has declined, having turned down the role of Robert Wakefield in ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'', a role that eventually went to [[Michael Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Daly| first = Steve| title = Dope &amp; Glory| work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]| date = 2001-03-02| url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,280028,00.html| accessdate = 2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal photography===
Gaghan shot in over 200 locations on four continents with 100 speaking parts.&lt;ref name="Farber"/&gt; ''Syriana'' originally had five storylines, all of which were filmed. The fifth storyline, centering on [[Michelle Monaghan]] playing a [[Miss USA]] who becomes involved with a rich Arab oilman, was cut when the film became too complicated.&lt;ref name="Grady"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farber"/&gt; Also, a role played by [[Greta Scacchi]], as Bob Barnes' wife, was also cut before the final release. Parts of the film were shot in Dubai and other parts of the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/how-hollywood-located-dubai-1.340635|title=How Hollywood located Dubai|author=Vinita Bharadwaj, Staff Reporter|work=GulfNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
The film's title is suggested to derive from the hypothesized ''[[Pax Syriana]],'' as an allusion to the necessary state of peace between Syria and the U.S. as it relates to the oil business. In a December 2005 interview, Baer told [[NPR]] that the title is a [[metaphor]] for foreign intervention in the Middle East, referring to post-[[World War II]] [[think tank]] strategic studies for the creation of an artificial state (such as [[Iraq]], created from elements of the former [[Ottoman Empire]]) that ensured continued western access to crude oil. The movie's website states that "‘Syriana’ is a real term used by Washington think-tanks to describe a hypothetical reshaping of the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syrianamovie.warnerbros.com/about.html|title=Syriana Blu-ray|work=www.WBShop.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaghan said he saw Syriana as "a great word that could stand for man's perpetual hope of remaking any geographic region to suit his own needs."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Gaghan]]'s [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/11/14/DI2005111400923.html discussion] with [[Washington Post|''The Washington Post'']] in November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
The word ''Syriana'' derives from ''Syria'' + the Latin suffix ''-ana''; it means, roughly, "in the manner of Syria."  Historically, [[Syria]] refers not to the state that since 1944 has borne the name, but to a [[region of Syria|more extensive land]] stretching from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the middle Euphrates River and the western edge of the desert steppe, and from the Tauric system of mountains in the north to the edge of the Sinai desert in the south.  This land was part of the [[Fertile Crescent]], and has historically been a geopolitically crucial junction for trade routes from the east, from Asia Minor and the Aegean, and from Egypt, and has long been a focus of great power conflicts.  The word ''Syria'' does not appear in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew original of the Scriptures]], but appears in the [[Septuagint]] as the translation of [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. Herodotus speaks of "Syrians" as identical with [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], but the term's geographical significance was not well defined in pre-Greek and Greek times. As an ethnic term, "Syrian" came to refer in Antiquity to [[Semitic people]]s living outside Mesopotamian and Arabian areas.  Greco-Roman administrations were the first to apply the term to a definite district.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 11th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Syriana'' was released on November 23, 2005 in limited release in only five theaters grossing $374,502 on its opening weekend. It went into wide release on December 9, 2005 in 1,752 theaters grossing $11.7 million on that weekend. It went on to make $50.8 million in North America and $43.1 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $93.9 million.&lt;ref name= "boxoffice"&gt;{{cite news| last =| first =| coauthors =| title = ''Syriana''| work = Box Office Mojo| pages =| language =| publisher =| date =| url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=syriana.htm| accessdate = 2009-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Censor authorities in some parts of the Middle East censored parts of the movie, because it depicted foreigners being ill-treated. Although abuse of foreign workers is rife, the censor authorities deemed such scenes as insulting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/dubai-censor-cuts-scenes-of-labour-abuse-from-syriana-6103242.html|title=Dubai censor cuts scenes of labour abuse from 'Syriana'|author=Jerome Taylor|date=20 April 2006|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Syriana'' received generally positive reviews. On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has a rating of 72% based on 196 reviews, with an average score of 6.9/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/syriana/|title=Syriana|date=9 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has a score of 76 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 40 critics indicating "Generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/syriana|title=Syriana|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a motion picture, the main criticism, even among reviewers who praised the film, was the confusion created by following numerous stories. Most critics stated that it was almost impossible to follow the plot, though some, notably [[Roger Ebert]], praised precisely that quality of the film and offered an interesting hidden story possibility (a covert deal between the U.S. and China involving oil being shipped through Kazakhstan and passed off as coming from a different source).&lt;ref name= "ebert"&gt;{{cite news| last = Ebert| first = Roger| coauthors =| title = ''Syriana''| work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = December 9, 2005| url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051208/REVIEWS/51130002/1023| accessdate = 2009-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience confusion mimics the confusion of the characters, who are enmeshed in the events around them without a clear understanding of what precisely is going on. As with Gaghan's screenplay for ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'', ''Syriana'' uses multiple, parallel storylines, jumping from locations in [[Texas]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[Switzerland]], [[Spain]], and the [[Middle East]], leading film critic Ebert to describe the film as [[hyperlink cinema]].&lt;ref name= "ebert"/&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, "Gaghan relies on Clooney's agnostic heroism to lure viewers into his maze. When they get there, they will find not a conventionally satisfying movie but a kind of illustrated journalism: an engrossing, insider's tour of the world's hottest spots, grandest schemes and most dangerous men."&lt;ref name= "corliss"&gt;{{cite news| last = Corliss| first = Richard| coauthors =| title = A Thriller That Thinks| work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = November 21, 2005| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1132826,00.html| accessdate = 2009-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Kenneth Turan wrote, "This is conspiracy-theory filmmaking of the most [[bravura]] kind, but if only a fraction of its suppositions are true, we—and the world—are in a world of trouble."&lt;ref name="turan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Turan |first=Kenneth |coauthors= |title=''Syriana'' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |pages= |language= |publisher= |date=November 23, 2005 |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/turan/cl-et-syriana23nov23,0,7214793.story |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121200016/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/turan/cl-et-syriana23nov23,0,7214793.story |archivedate=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, "Gaghan assumes his audience is smart enough to follow his explosive tour of global petro-politics.

In his review for ''[[The New York Observer]]'', [[Andrew Sarris]] wrote: "If anything, ''Syriana'' tends to oversimplify a mind-bogglingly multifaceted problem that cannot so easily be resolved by a diatribe against the supposedly all-powerful 'Americans.'"&lt;ref name= "sarris"&gt;{{cite news| last = Sarris| first = Andrew| coauthors =| title = Soderbergh, Clooney and Co.

Instead of complexity, there is a blank, uncompelling tangle, which conceals a kind of complacent political correctness."&lt;ref name= "bradshaw"&gt;{{cite news| last = Bradshaw| first = Peter| coauthors =| title = ''Syriana''| work = [[The Guardian]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = March 3, 2006| url = https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/mar/03/1| accessdate = 2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Titanium]] was first introduced into surgeries in the 1950s after having been used in dentistry for a decade prior. It is now the metal of choice for prosthetics, internal fixation, inner body devices, and instrumentation. Titanium is used from head to toe in biomedical implants. One can find titanium in neurosurgery, bone conduction hearing aids, false eye implants, spinal fusion cages, [[pacemakers]], toe implants, and shoulder/elbow/hip/knee replacements along with many more. The main reason why titanium is often used in the body is due to titanium's [[biocompatibility]] and, with surface modifications, bioactive surface. The surface characteristics that affect biocompatibility are [[surface texture]], steric hindrance, binding sites, and [[hydrophobicity]] (wetting). These characteristics are optimized to create an ideal cellular response. Some medical implants, as well as parts of surgical instruments are coated with [[titanium nitride]] (TiN).

==Biocompatibility ==
Titanium is considered the most [[biocompatible]] metal due to its resistance to corrosion from bodily fluids, bio-inertness, capacity for osseointegration, and high fatigue limit.  Titanium's ability to withstand the harsh bodily environment is a result of the protective oxide film that forms naturally in the presence of oxygen. The oxide film is strongly adhered, insoluble, and chemically impermeable, preventing reactions between the metal and the surrounding environment. The mechanical properties of the material and the loading conditions in the host have, conventionally, influenced material selection for different clinical applications: predominantly Ti6Al4V in orthopaedics while commercially pure titanium in dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shah |first1=Furqan A. |last2=Trobos |first2=Margarita |last3=Thomsen |first3=Peter |last4=Palmquist |first4=Anders |title=Commercially pure titanium (cp-Ti) versus titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) materials as bone anchored implants — Is one truly better than the other? |journal=Materials Science and Engineering: C |date=May 2016 |volume=62 |pages=960–966 |doi=10.1016/j.msec.2016.01.032 |pmid=26952502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osseointegration interaction and proliferation===

====High energy surfaces induce angiogenesis during osseointegration====
It has been suggested that titanium's capacity for [[osseointegration]] stems from the high dielectric constant of its surface oxide, which does not denature proteins (like [[tantalum]], and [[cobalt]] [[alloy]]s).&lt;ref name=Black&gt;Black J (1994) Biological performance of tantalum. Clin Mater 16: 167–173.&lt;/ref&gt; Its ability to physically bond with bone gives titanium an advantage over other materials that require the use of an adhesive to remain attached. Titanium implants last longer and much higher forces are required to break the bonds that join them to the body compared to their alternatives.&lt;ref name=raines&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.02.071 |title=Regulation of angiogenesis during osseointegration by titanium surface microstructure and energy |year=2010 |last1=Raines |first1=Andrew L. |last2=Olivares-Navarrete |first2=Rene |last3=Wieland |first3=Marco |last4=Cochran |first4=David L. |last5=Schwartz |first5=Zvi |last6=Boyan |first6=Barbara D. |journal=Biomaterials |volume=31 |issue=18 |pages=4909–17 |pmid=20356623 |pmc=2896824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Surface properties determine osseointegration====
The surface properties of a biomaterial play an important role in determining cellular response (cell adhesion and proliferation) to the material. Titanium's microstructure and high surface energy enable it to induce angiogenesis, which assists in the process of osseointegration.&lt;ref&gt;http://titaniumthemetal.org/Resources/DataSheetMedical.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surface energy==

===Redox potential===
Titanium can have many different standard electrode potentials depending on its oxidation state.  Solid titanium has a [[standard electrode potential]] of -1.63V. Materials with a greater standard electrode potential are more easily reduced, making them better oxidizing agents.&lt;ref name= poten/&gt;  As can be seen in the table below, solid titanium prefers to undergo oxidation, making it a better reducing agent.

===Surface coating===
[[File:Protein Absorption to Oxide Layer.jpg|thumb|Cellular binding to a titanium oxide surface]]

Titanium naturally passivates, forming an oxide film that becomes heterogeneous and polarized as a function of exposure time to bodily environments.&lt;ref name=healy&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1751087 |year=1991 |last1=Healy |first1=Kevin E. |last2=Ducheyne |first2=Paul |title=A physical model for the titanium-tissue interface |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=M150–1 |journal=ASAIO Transactions |url=http://journals.lww.com/asaiojournal/Abstract/1991/07000/A_Physical_Model_for_the_Titanium_Tissue_Interface.16.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the increased adsorption of hydroxyl groups, lipoproteins, and glycolipids over time.&lt;ref name=healy/&gt;  The adsorption of these compounds changes how the material interacts with the body and can improve biocompatibility.  In titanium alloys such as Ti-Zr and Ti-Nb, zirconium and niobium ions that are liberated due to corrosion are not released into the patient's body, but rather added to the passivation layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0142-9612(97)00146-4 |title=Titanium alloys in total joint replacement—a materials science perspective |year=1998 |last1=Long |first1=Marc |last2=Rack |first2=H.J |journal=Biomaterials |volume=19 |issue=18 |pages=1621–39 |pmid=9839998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The alloying elements in the passive layer add a degree of biocompatibility and corrosion resistance depending on the original alloy composition of the bulk metal prior to corrosion.

Protein surface concentration, (&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;), is defined by the equation

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma={Q_{\text{ADS}}M\over nF}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/la991497x |title=Electrochemical Studies of the Adsorption Behavior of Serum Proteins on Titanium |year=2000 |last1=Jackson |first1=Douglas R. |last2=Omanović |first2=Saša |last3=Roscoe |first3=Sharon G. |journal=Langmuir |volume=16 |issue=12 |pages=5449–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where Q&lt;sub&gt;ADS&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface charge density in C cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, M is the molar mass of the protein in g mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, n is the number of electrons transferred (in this case, one electron for each protonated amino group in the protein), and F is the Faraday constant in C mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The equation for collision frequency is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{c}}={2\pi DcdN_{\text{A}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;

where D = 8.83 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is the diffusion coefficient of the BSA molecule at 310 K, d = 7.2&amp;nbsp;nm is the “diameter” of the proteinwhich is equivalent to twice the Stokes radius, NA = 6.023 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is Avogadro's number, and c* = 0.23 g L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (3.3 μM) is the critical bulk supersaturation concentration.

===Wetting and solid surface===

[[Wetting]] occurs as a function of two parameters: surface roughness and surface fraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0927-7757(02)00061-4 |title=Wetting of textured surfaces |year=2002 |last1=Bico |first1=José |last2=Thiele |first2=Uwe |last3=Quéré |first3=David |journal=Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects |volume=206 |pages=41–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By increasing wetting, implants can decrease the time required for osseointegration by allowing cells to more readily bind to the surface of an implant.&lt;ref name=raines/&gt; Wetting of titanium can be modified by optimizing process parameters such as temperature, time, and pressure (shown in table below).

==Adsorption==

===Corrosion===
Mechanical abrasion of the titanium oxide film leads to an increased rate of [[corrosion]].&lt;ref name=urban&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jbm.b.31171 |title=''In vivo'' severe corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement of retrieved modular body titanium alloy hip-implants |year=2009 |last1=Rodrigues |first1=Danieli C. |last2=Urban |first2=Robert M. |last3=Jacobs |first3=Joshua J. |last4=Gilbert |first4=Jeremy L. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials |volume=88 |pages=206–19 |pmid=18683224 |issue=1 |pmc=2667129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titanium and its alloys are not immune to corrosion when in the human body. Titanium alloys are susceptible to hydrogen absorption which can induce precipitation of hydrides and cause embrittlement, leading to material failure.&lt;ref name=urban/&gt; "Hydrogen embrittlement was observed as an in vivo mechanism of degradation under fretting-crevice corrosion conditions resulting in TiH formation, surface reaction and cracking inside Ti/Ti modular body tapers."&lt;ref name=urban/&gt; Studying and testing titanium behavior in the body allow us to avoid malpractices that would cause a fatal breakdown in the implant, like the usage of dental products with high fluoride concentration or substances capable of lowering the pH of the media around the implant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dynadental.com/editor/download-121/091102%20Nakagawa%20M%20-%20Effect%20of%20Fluoride%20and%20pH%20on%20Titanium%20-%20ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adhesion===
[[File:Bioactive Surface Coating Sketch On a Metal Surface.jpg|thumb|A metal surface with grafted polymers multimeric constructs to promote cell binding.  The polymers grafted on the metal surface are brushed, increasing the contact area for cell integration]]

The cells at the implant interface are highly sensitive to foreign objects. When implants are installed into the body, the cells initiate an inflammatory response which could lead to encapsulation, impairing the functioning of the implanted device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.078 |title=Immune responses to implants – A review of the implications for the design of immunomodulatory biomaterials |year=2011 |last1=Franz |first1=Sandra |last2=Rammelt |first2=Stefan |last3=Scharnweber |first3=Dieter |last4=Simon |first4=Jan C. |journal=Biomaterials |volume=32 |issue=28 |pages=6692–709 |pmid=21715002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal cell response to a bioactive surface is characterized by biomaterial stabilization and integration, as well as the reduction of potential bacterial infection sites on the surface. One example of biomaterial integration is a titanium implant with an engineered [[biointerface]] covered with [[biomimetic]] motifs. Surfaces with these biomimetic motifs have shown to enhance integrin binding and signaling and stem cell differentiation. Increasing the density of ligand clustering also increased integrin binding. A coating consisting of trimers and pentamers increased the bone-implant contact area by 75% when compared to the current clinical standard of uncoated titanium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001002 |title=Multivalent Integrin-Specific Ligands Enhance Tissue Healing and Biomaterial Integration |year=2010 |last1=Petrie |first1=T.

J. |journal=Science Translational Medicine |volume=2 |issue=45 |pages=45ra60 |pmid=20720217 |pmc=3128787}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase in area allows for increased cellular integration, and reduces rejection of implanted device. 
The [[Langmuir isotherm]]:

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma={B_{\text{ADS}}\Gamma_{\text{max}}\over (1+cB_{\text{ADS}})}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;

where c is the concentration of the adsorbate &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the max amount of adsorbed protein, B&lt;sub&gt;ADS&lt;/sub&gt; is the affinity of the adsorbate molecules toward adsorption sites. The Langmuir isotherm can be linearized by rearranging the equation to,

&lt;math&gt;{c\over\Gamma}={{1\over {B_{\text{ADS}}\Gamma_{\text{max}}}} + {c\over \Gamma_{\text{max}}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;

This simulation is a good approximation of adsorption to a surface when compared to experimental values.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;  The Langmuir isotherm for adsorption of elements onto the titanium surface can be determined by plotting the know parameters. An experiment of [[fibrinogen]] adsorption on a titanium surface "confirmed the applicability of the Langmuir isotherm in the description of adsorption of fibrinogen onto Ti surface."&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;

In the bulk of a non-interacting topological insulator, the [[electronic band structure]] resembles an ordinary band insulator, with the [[Fermi level]] falling between the conduction and valence bands. On the surface of a topological insulator there are special states that fall within the bulk energy gap and allow surface metallic conduction. Carriers in these surface states have their [[Spin quantum number|spin]] locked at a right-angle to their momentum (spin-momentum locking). At a given energy the only other available electronic states have different spin, so the [[Umklapp scattering|"U"-turn scattering]] is strongly suppressed and conduction on the surface is highly metallic. Non-interacting topological insulators are characterized by an index (known as '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; topological invariants) similar to the [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] in topology.&lt;ref name=KM/&gt;

The "protected" conducting states in the surface are required by [[time-reversal symmetry]] and the band structure of the material. The states cannot be removed by [[Passivation (chemistry)|surface passivation]] if it does not break the time-reversal symmetry, which does not  happen with potential and/or spin-orbit scattering, but happens in case of true magnetic impurities (e.g. spin-scattering).&lt;ref&gt;Th.

The non-trivialness of topological insulators is encoded in the existence of a gas of helical Dirac fermions. [[Helical Dirac fermion]]s, which behave like massless relativistic particles, have been observed in 3D topological insulators. Note that the gapless surface states of topological insulator differ from those in the [[Quantum Hall effect]]: the gapless surface states of topological insulator are symmetry-protected (i.e. not topological), while the gapless surface states in [[Quantum Hall effect]] are topological (i.e. robust against any local perturbations that can break all the symmetries). The '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; topological invariants cannot be measured using traditional transport methods, such as spin Hall conductance, and the transport is not quantized by the '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; invariants. An experimental method to measure '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; topological invariants was demonstrated which provide a measure of the '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; topological order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1167733 | last = Hsieh | first = D. |author2=D.

'''Toyota Canada Inc. (TCI)''' is the exclusive distributor of [[Toyota]], [[Lexus]] and [[Scion (automobile)|Scion]] cars, SUV’s and trucks in [[Canada]].   Founded in 1964, Toyota has sold more than 4 million vehicles in [[Canada]] through a national network of 285 Toyota, Lexus and Scion dealerships.  TCI’s head office is located in [[Toronto]], Ontario, with regional offices in [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Montreal]] and [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] and parts distribution centres in [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]].
In January 2013, TCI became a subsidiary of [[Toyota Motor Corporation]] (TMC) with 51% ownership share and [[Mitsui &amp; Co.]] Ltd. as minority 49% shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/toyota-brings-outsiders-into-the-fold/article9390433/|title=Toyota Brings Outsiders Into The Fold|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=2013-04-06|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current CEO and president of Toyota Canada is Larry Hutchinson, who replaced Seiji Ichii on January 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/toyota-canadas-ceo-to-leave-job/article4181501/|title=Toyota Canada's CEO to leave job|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=2011-12-11|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 1990, TCI expanded its operations to begin selling luxury vehicles to Canadians through the [[Lexus]] brand.  Twenty years later, in October 2010, TCI further expanded its sales operations to begin selling [[Scion (automobile)|Scion]] branded vehicles in Canada.  As of July 2014, there are 247 Toyota, 38 Lexus, and 92 Scion franchises in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.ca/toyota/en/company-info/toyota-invest/overview|title=Toyota Investing In Canada|publisher=Toyota Canada Inc.|date=2015-01-08|accessdate=2015-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822170540/http://www.toyota.ca/toyota/en/company-info/toyota-invest/overview|archivedate=2015-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 half (50.0%) of all Toyota vehicles sold in Canada were built at [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada]], Inc. (TMMC) while 83.0% of all Toyota vehicles sold in Canada were produced at one of Toyota's 14 plants throughout North America.  By comparison, in 2001 only 32.1% of Toyota vehicles sold in Canada were produced in Canada and only 45.1% were produced in North America.  In 2017, Toyota Canada Inc. experienced its best year of sales to date with 224,547 vehicles sold, a 3.1% increase in overall annual sales growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toyota Canada Inc.

Beginning September 2014, Toyota celebrated its 50th Anniversary in Canada. The anniversary festivities began with the introduction of a special edition 2015 [[Toyota Corolla]] S and special edition 2015 [[RAV4]] sporting unique Canadian interior and exterior features and paint colours.  Only 2000 of each of these vehicles were produced for Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.ca/toyota/en/build-price/cor|title=TOYOTA CANADA:Build and Price|publisher=Toyota Canada Inc.|date=2015-01-08|accessdate=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing &amp; Engineering in Canada==
Toyota operates two vehicle manufacturing facilities in Canada at [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada]], Inc. (TMMC) which build popular [[Toyota]] and [[Lexus]] vehicles for the North American market.  The [[Toyota Corolla]], [[Lexus RX]] 350 and [[Lexus RX]] 450h Hybrid are manufactured at TMMC’s North and South plant in Cambridge, Ontario.  The [[Toyota RAV4]] is manufactured at TMMC’s Woodstock, Ontario plant which was opened in 2007.  The [[Toyota Matrix]] built at TMMC's Cambridge plant from 2002 ceased production in June 2014 while the Toyota [[RAV4 EV]] (electric vehicle for the North American market) built at TMMC's Woodstock plant from 2012 ceased production in August 2014.

Since opening in 1988, TMMC has built more than 6 million vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodstocksentinelreview.com/2014/09/30/toyota-motor-manufacturing-canada-donates-its-six-millionth-vehicle-to-canadian-mental-health-association-of-oxford-county-during-woodstock-ceremony|title=Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada donates Rav4 to CMHA in celebration of its six-millionth vehicle|publisher=Woodstock Sentinel Review|date=2014-09-30|accessdate=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Canadian and U.S. consumers with the vast majority (approximately 4.6 million) being exported to the [[United States]].  In September 2003, TMMC's Cambridge facility was expanded and became the first Toyota plant outside Japan to manufacture a luxury vehicle [[Lexus RX]]).  Production was further expanded in 2014 to also produce the ([[Lexus RX]] 450h.  It is expected to continue to be the only [[Lexus]] manufacturer outside [[Japan]] until Fall 2015 when [[Lexus ES]] 350 production is expected to commence at [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky]], Inc. (TMMK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressroom.toyota.com/releases/lexus+tmmk+construction+begins+assembly+line.htm|title=Lexus' New Kentucky Home Celebrates First Milestone|publisher=Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.|date=2014-01-08|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, TMMC remains the largest Toyota plant in North America by production volume (579,411 vehicles) with a 15% increase in production versus 2013.

The Toyota's Canadian operation has received various awards and recognitions. TMMC's plant has earned 14 [[J.D. Power &amp; Associates]] Plant Quality awards including SIX (6) Gold awards and TWO (2) coveted Platinum Plant Quality Award in 2011 and 2014 – the first Toyota plant outside Japan that has ever won this award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmmc.ca/en/news-18-11-2011-2.html|title=Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada Celebrates J.D.

Toyota also operates several parts manufacturing operations in Canada including '''Canadian Auto Parts Toyota, Inc. (CAPTIN)''', a wholly owned subsidiary of TMC which manufactures aluminum alloy wheels for the global market.  Established in [[Delta, British Columbia]] in 1983, this 24,645 m2 facility produced approximately 1.7 million aluminum alloy wheels and employed 310 people in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.ca/cgi-bin/WebObjects/WWW.woa/5/wo/Home.AboutToyota.NorthAmericanization-tt7tAbzNIoPavq8gLv8dBM/3.7?a130140e.html|title=Manufacturing In Canada|publisher=Toyota Canada Inc.|date=2014-04-29|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In August 2011, CAPTIN and the [[University of British Columbia]] announced a partnership to refine the manufacturing process for water-cooled die casting to produce stronger, lighter and lower-cost aluminum wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/2011/08/29/ubc-and-toyota-receive-federal-funds-to-re-invent-wheel-manufacturing/|title=UBC and Toyota receive federal funds to re-invent wheel manufacturing|publisher=University of British Columbia - Public Affairs|date=2011-08-29|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toyota Canada’s Cold Weather Testing Centre''' was established in 1974 in [[Timmins, Ontario]] to test vehicles from across Toyota’s global lineup to ensure optimal performance in extreme cold weather conditions.  With the addition of a cold chamber, Toyota can test vehicles year-round in harsh sub-zero conditions to ensure that vehicles meet highest customer expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.ca/cgi-bin/WebObjects/WWW.woa/7/wo/Home.AboutToyota.NorthAmericanization-dPN6cVL9bbXB3cknjVsJIg/0.7?a130150e%2ehtml|title=Toyota In North America|publisher=Toyota Canada Inc.|date=2014-04-29|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
In 2011, Toyota introduced the '''Star Safety System™''' as standard on every new vehicle. It features six advanced accident avoidance safety technologies:
#'''[[Anti-Lock Braking System]] (ABS)''' - helps prevent brakes from locking up by "pulsing" brake pressure to each wheel to help you stay in control in emergency braking situations
#'''Brake Assist''' - is designed to detect sudden or "panic" braking and adds the full pressure needed to help prevent a collision
#'''Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD)''' – helps keep the vehicle more stable and balanced when braking
#'''[[Vehicle Stability Control]] (VSC)''' - helps prevent wheel slip and loss of traction by reducing engine power and applying brake force to the wheels that need it
#'''[[Traction Control]]''' - helps maintain traction on wet, icy, loose or uneven surfaces by applying brake force to the spinning wheel(s)
#'''Smart Stop Technology''' - automatically cuts engine power and allows the brakes to take precedence over the accelerator when both pedals are pressed at the same time

In January 2011, Toyota launched the '''Collaborative Safety Research Center (CSRC)''' to serve as a catalyst for the advancement of auto safety in North America. Toyota shares its talent, technology and data with many research partners, including the [[University of Toronto]], who focus on some of the most pressing issues of the day, from improving driver-and-vehicle command interfaces to advanced pre-crash notification systems. Most importantly, Toyota shares the results of its research so that the entire automotive industry can benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/csrc|title=Toyota Collaborative Safety Research Center|publisher=Toyota Motor Sales, USA., Inc.|date=2014-04-29|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toyota also partners with other stakeholders engaged in road safety research, in the development of safe driving programs and new safety technologies, and in hands-on driver education.  
The '''Traffic Injury Research Foundation (TIRF)''' is Canada's road safety research institute. Since 2002, Toyota Canada has partnered with TIRF to conduct studies and develop educational resources for young drivers and, more recently, turned the focus to helping all Canadians better understand the often complex and wide ranging safety technologies in today's automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainonboard.ca|title=About The Program|publisher=Brain on Board, Inc.|date=2014-04-29|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''kartSTART''' is a hands-on driver's education program that uses go-karts to introduce young drivers to the demands and dynamics of life behind the wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kartstart.ca|title=kartSTART|publisher=kartSTART, Inc.|date=2014-04-29|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advanced Technology Powertrains==
TCI markets hybrid electric vehicles under the [[Toyota]] and [[Lexus]] brands throughout [[Canada]], including the [[Prius]], the world’s first mass-produced gas-electric hybrid vehicle.  Since the launch of the [[Prius]] in Canada in 2000, [[Toyota]] and [[Lexus]] have added an additional 10 hybrids and 1 hybrid plug-in vehicle to its Canadian model line-up:
#[[Toyota Prius]]
#[[Toyota Prius c]]
#[[Toyota Prius v]]
#[[Toyota Camry Hybrid]]
#[[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]]
#[[Toyota Highlander Hybrid]]
#[[Toyota RAV4 Hybrid]]
#[[Lexus CT 200h]]
#[[Lexus ES 300h]]
#[[Lexus GS 450h]]
#[[Lexus LS 600h L]]
#[[Lexus RX 450h]]
#[[Lexus NX]] 300h

Since the introduction of the Toyota Prius in 2000, more than 75% of all hybrid vehicles sold in Canada were made by Toyota.  In September 2014, Toyota celebrated the sale of its 100,000th hybrid vehicle in Canada.  Toyota estimates that Toyota and Lexus hybrids have saved Canadians almost 260 million litres of fuel - the equivalent of 103 Olympic-sized swimming pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.toyota.ca/releases/toyota-reaches-milestone-of-100-000-hybrids-sold-in-canada/|title=Toyota reaches milestone of 100,000 hybrids sold in Canada|publisher=Toyota Canada Inc.|date=2014-09-03|accessdate=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
Since 2001, Toyota Canada Inc. has maintained [[ISO 14001]] registration for an effective environmental management system (EMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://media.toyota.ca/pr/tci/en/toyota-canada-reaches-10-years-219744.aspx|title=Toyota Canada reaches 10 years of ISO 14001 compliance|publisher=Toyota Canada Inc. Newsroom|date=2011-11-23|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TCI’s head office was the first Toyota facility in North America to achieve this certification. 
TCI has established a Corporate Environmental Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.ca/toyota/en/environment/tci-environmental-policy?woSessionId=9ZsrT2Yr2alQpmBkFui6nw&amp;woInstanceId=18&amp;locale=en|title=Corporate Environmental Policy|publisher=Toyota Canada Inc., Inc.|date=2014-04-29|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which outlines its commitment towards continually reducing the daily impact of all its activities, services and operations. TCI also contributes to the publication of an annual North American Environmental Report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.ca/toyota/en/environment/environmental-report|title=2013 North American Environmental Report|publisher=Toyota Motor Sales, USA., Inc, Inc.|date=2014-04-29|accessdate=2014-04-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923160241/http://www.toyota.ca/toyota/en/environment/environmental-report|archivedate=2015-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on progress, success, and future inspirations.  A number of Toyota’s Canadian dealerships have also achieved LEED Gold Standard, one of the strictest levels of LEED certification.

Since 2000, through the '''Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds''', Toyota Canada and its dealerships have contributed over $3.2 million in grants to more than 5,500 schools and impacted more than 1.15 Million students through projects that transform school grounds into green outdoor classrooms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.toyota.ca/toyota/en/about/environment|title=Environment - Toyota Canada|website=Toyota Canada|language=en|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''West Cork oil spill''' was an [[oil spill]] off the southern coast of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The spill was first identified by the [[European Maritime Safety Agency]]'s CleanSeaNet satellite monitoring system on 14 February 2009.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Siggins | first = Lorna | work = The Irish Times | title = Oil slick drifts towards Irish coast as polluter silence hurts clean-up efforts| date = 18 February 2009 | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0218/1224241331512.html | accessdate = 2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[Irish Air Corps]] marine patrol aircraft confirmed the slick's presence near the {{ship|Russian aircraft carrier|Admiral Kuznetsov||2|up=y}} which was undergoing refuelling around the same time. The British Coastguard and Irish Department of Transport agreed that around 300 tonnes of oil were spilled.  The Russian Navy accepted responsibility for the incident but disputed the quantity, claiming around 20-30 tonnes had been spilt either whilst washing the decks or pumping out the bilges of the carrier, the Russian Navy made no notification to any authority at the time of the spill. The oil spill drifted eastwards and there were fears that the spill would wash up on the coast of south eastern Ireland or Wales but it broke up before this.

== Discovery ==
On 14 February 2009, the [[Irish Coast Guard]] received a European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) surveillance report indicating the presence of water pollution off the south coast of Ireland.&lt;ref name="transport.ie"&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = Irish Department of Transport|  title = Coastguard Press Release- Oil Spill fifty miles south of Fastnet| date =  17 February 2009 | url = http://www.transport.ie/pressRelease.aspx?Id=52 | accessdate = 2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  EMSA's [[CleanSeaNet]] system made the initial detection and reported up to four separate slicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Journel|first1=Marc|title=CleanSeaNet: Satellite-based monitoring service for marine oil spill detection and surveillance in European waters|journal=European Maritime Safety Agency Bulletin|date=2009|volume=104|issue=2|page=51|url=http://thordonbearings.com/system/documents/documents/123/original/CleanSeaNet_detecting_spills_via_satellite.pdf?1284040507|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pelizzari|first1=Sónia|title=CleanSeaNet: "The New Generation"|date=20 June 2012|publisher=EMSA Unit C3 Satellite Based Monitoring Services|location=Tromso|page=60|url=https://earth.esa.int/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=233928&amp;name=DLFE-2186.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Coast Guard dispatched an [[Irish Air Corps]] [[CASA CN-235]] maritime patrol aircraft to investigate which confirmed the presence of oil on the surface of the sea around a Russian Navy oil tanker and the ''Admiral Kuznetsov'' aircraft carrier.&lt;ref name="transport.ie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RIA"&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = RIA Novosti | title =Media exaggerating oil spill off Irish coast| url = http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090217/120186914.html | date = 17 February 2009 |accessdate = 2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The spill was located in [[international waters]] 80&amp;nbsp;km (50&amp;nbsp;mi) south of [[Fastnet Rock]], Ireland's most southwesterly point, and spread over an area measuring 6.4&amp;nbsp;km (4&amp;nbsp;mi) by 8&amp;nbsp;km (5&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith| first = Lewis| title = Huge oil slick from Russian ship heads for British coastline| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article5753603.ece |date = 2009-02-17 |accessdate = 2009-02-17 | publisher=[[The Times]]|work=Times Online | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Sweeney| first = Conor | title = Russia denies causing oil spill off Irish coast| date = 17 February 2009 | publisher = Reuters | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKLH43140520090217 | accessdate = 2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 February, the Russian [[naval attaché]] in Ireland confirmed that the carrier had been carrying out [[underway replenishment|replenishment of fuel at sea]] from a Russian supply tanker. The attaché confirmed an internal investigation was being carried out into the cause of the incident and said that Russian aerial surveillance considered that approximately 300 tonnes of oil was on the sea surface but could not tell how this happened or whether it was from their refuelling operations.&lt;ref name="transport.ie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = Bloomberg.com| title = Oil Spill Off Ireland May Hit Irish, Welsh Shores (Update1) | date = 17 February 2009 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=an22dhjynQrw&amp;refer=uk | accessdate = 2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Navy offered no explanation for the presence of the oil but began an internal investigation into the matter.&lt;ref name="transport.ie"/&gt;  Admiral Korolev, the commander of the Russian ships stated that the refuelling proceeded in a routine manner and that there had been no leaks.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = Agence France-Presse | title = Ireland scrambles over Russian navy oil spill | date = 17 February 2009 | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iBNa8BOeeKCzKfZlrck3S4ztBYNA| accessdate = 2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Russian Navy stated that it was willing to share data in an attempt to identify the origin of the spill but stated that it was "not catastrophic in nature and [did] not present a threat to the coastal environment".&lt;ref name="RIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;  The ''Admiral Kuznetsov'' is normally accompanied by at least one ocean-going tug in case of breakdown, on this occasion she was also accompanied by the ''[[Russian destroyer Admiral Chabanenko|Admiral Chabanenko]]''. &lt;ref name="RIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;  The carrier was en route to its home port following exercises in the Mediterranean Sea where, on 6 January, it suffered a fire which resulted in the death of one sailor.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

The [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|British Coastguard]] initially estimated the quantity of oil spilled at around 1,000 tonnes, later revised down to 522 and then to 300 tonnes, a figure with which the Irish [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Department of Transport]] agreed with.&lt;ref name="transport.ie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RTE"&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = RTÉ News | title = Oil slick may reach Wexford in 16 days | date = 17 February 2009 | url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0217/oil.html | accessdate = 2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AssociatedPress"/&gt;  If the original 1,000 tonnes estimate had proven accurate then this oil spill would have been the biggest to have affected Great Britain and Ireland since the {{MV|Sea Empress||2}} ran aground near [[Milford Haven]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

Late on 17 February 2009, the spill was confirmed to have broken into three streams moving eastwards along Ireland's south coast, at a distance of around 48–64&amp;nbsp;km (30-40&amp;nbsp;mi) offshore.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="transport.ie"/&gt;  On 18 February changing wind patterns and unexpected mild weather had pushed the oil slick, which had not moved significantly since the evening before, further from shore.&lt;ref name="PressAsoc"&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = Press Association| author-link =Press Association | title = Mild weather may avert disaster| date = 18 February 2009 | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5heUnLqLwk1fL9BmWBn4R4T8Ree6g | accessdate = 2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Irish Coast Guard ran computer simulations of the spill and expected some oil to dissolve or evaporate. Depending on weather conditions, the spill could have washed up onto the Irish south-east coast in late February and may have hit Wales shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; On 20 February, however, the spill was reported to be moving very slowly eastwards and the Irish Coast Guard said that it was possible that the slick may avoid the Irish coast completely, owing to favourable winds. By 23 February the spill was moving at just five nautical miles per day and was {{convert|50|km|mi}} south of Cork harbour and continuing to disperse.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com3"/&gt;  By 25 February the slick was expected to move further away from the Irish coastline whilst continuing to disperse and break up and on 27 February the Irish Coast Guard confirmed it now expected the spill to disperse before making landfall unless there was a significant change to the expected weather.&lt;ref name="Wexford"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = County safe from major oil spillage| url = http://www.wexfordpeople.ie/news/county-safe-from-major-oil-spillage-1654407.html|date = 2009-02-25 |accessdate = 2009-02-26 | publisher=Wexford People|work=Wexford People}}&lt;/ref&gt;  EMSA continued to monitor the spill until its complete dispersal on 8 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil spill detection examples: Admiral Kuznetsov, February 2009|url=http://www.emsa.europa.eu/csn-menu/csn-service/oil-spill-detection-examples/item/1872-oil-spill-detection-examples-admiral-kuznetsov-february-2009.html|publisher=European Maritime Safety Agency|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental impact ===
The spill threatened birds, dolphins, porpoises and seals native to Ireland's south coast.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; The [[Irish Farmers' Association]] (IFA) Aquaculture division called on the relevant local authorities and the [[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)|Environmental Protection Agency]] to ensure that shellfish farmers in counties Cork, [[Wexford]] and [[Waterford]] were protected, as the area accounted for over 25% of Ireland's mussels and oyster production.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"/&gt; The [[Bord Iascaigh Mhara]] (Irish Fisheries Board) tested wild and farmed shellfish on the southern coast as a precautionary measure.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com3"/&gt;  Both the Irish and Russian authorities stated that the spill had not affected fishing areas or coastal habitats.&lt;ref name="Scotsman"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Russia admits oil leak off Ireland| url = http://news.scotsman.com/world/Russia-admits-oil-leak-off.5025772.jp|date = 2009-02-28 |accessdate = 2009-02-28 | publisher=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses ==
=== British and Irish national response ===

Both {{HMS|Gloucester|D96|6}}, a British destroyer,  and {{LÉ|Aisling|P23|6}}, an [[Irish Naval Service]] vessel responded to the scene.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"/&gt;  Samples of the oil were taken for analysis at the British [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]]'s (MCA) labs in [[Edinburgh]], and Ireland requested samples of oils carried on board the Russian vessels via the Russian Embassy in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;  The Irish Coast Guard contracted a tug, the ''Celtic Isle'', equipped with oil dispersal equipment from a [[Cork (city)|Cork]]-based company to assist in the clean-up operation.&lt;ref name="transport.ie"/&gt; The tug assessed and attempted to deploy [[Skimmer (machine)|skimmers]] on 18 February, but the Irish Coast Guard director said that international experience showed that success could be very limited. “unless this fuel oil can be sprayed within the first day of a spill, it is very difficult to deal with, and collection at sea has a success rate of about 1%”.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"/&gt;  The ''Celtic Isle'' was stood down by 26 February after having little success in recovering the oil.&lt;ref name="AFP2"/&gt;  The EMSA’s pollution response vessel for the Atlantic region, the ''Galway Fisher'', also made its way to Cork to take on board anti-pollution equipment and remain on stand-by.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"/&gt;  The MCA laboratory confirmed that the oil involved was a [[light crude oil]] on 21 or 22 February and further results announced on 26 February revealed the oil to be of Russian origin.&lt;ref name="AFP2"&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = Agence France-Presse | title = Russian navy accepts blame for oil spill off Ireland | date = 26 February 2009 | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtMlMM7M5Tlg5ddFw8zI8vjG0ebQ| accessdate = 2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com3"/&gt;

=== Local authorities ===
It was reported that both the British and Irish governments had drafted emergency plans for the cleaning of any affected coasts.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com2"/&gt; Oil washed up in Ireland was due to be recovered mechanically by local authorities using [[bulldozer]]s and skimmers with the assistance and supervision of the Coast Guard.&lt;ref name="transport.ie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="transport.ie2"&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = Irish Department of Transport| author-link = Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport | title = Update regarding oil pollution incident off Fastnet Rock | date =  17 February 2009 | url = http://www.transport.ie/pressRelease.aspx?Id=54 | accessdate = 2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 23 February it was reported that none of the Wexford, Waterford or Cork local authorities had in place oil pollution response plans as required by law since 1999, but Wexford's plan was almost complete.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com3"/&gt;

=== Russian Navy ===
The Russian Navy vessels left the area around 18 February, having completed refuelling.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"/&gt;  On 20 February the Russian military stated that it believed that the spill might have been caused during cleaning of the deck of the ''Admiral Kuznetsov''.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com2"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Siggins | first = Lorna | work = The Irish Times | title = Russian delegation to discuss oil slick| date = 20 February 2009 | url =http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0220/1224241488906.html | accessdate = 2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They dispatched a high-level diplomatic delegation to Ireland to discuss the impact of the spill which included experts in the field and Vice-Admiral Vyacheslav Popov, the deputy commander of the Russian Navy.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wexford"/&gt; They met with the Irish [[Minister of State (Ireland)|Minister of State]] for the [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Department of Transport]], [[Noel Ahern]], and Irish Coast Guard officials on 23 February.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com3"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Siggins | first = Lorna | work = The Irish Times | title = Light fuel oil slick likely to disperse| date = 23 February 2009 | url =http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0223/1224241663573.html | accessdate = 2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com4"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Siggins | first = Lorna | work = The Irish Times | title = Oil slick prompts criticism of emergency planning| date = 21 February 2009 | url =http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0221/1224241586223.html | accessdate = 2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussions included an assessment of the cost of recovery of the oil and the determination of liability for the spill.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com3"/&gt;

On 24 February, 10 days after the initial spill, the Russian delegation admitted, with extreme regret, responsibility for the incident.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com5" /&gt; The high-level Russian military delegation told the Irish Coast Guard that the incident may have occurred when bilges were inadvertently pumped out 80&amp;nbsp;km southeast of Fastnet Rock.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com5"/&gt;  The Russian internal investigation stated that "technical malfunction and human error" were the causes of the spill.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Russia admits Irish oil spillage| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7913007.stm|date = 2009-02-26 |accessdate = 2009-02-26 | publisher=[[BBC News]]|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Irish and Russian governments still disagreed over the size of the spill with Russian estimates placing it at 20 to 30 tons.&lt;ref name="AssociatedPress"&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = Associated Press| author-link =Associated Press | title =Russian Navy admits causing Irish oil slick| date = 27 February 2009 | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j6VDapPlFKcq4LwmPyCiSV1pDAGQD96K1IF00 | accessdate = 2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish Coast Guard expressed disappointment that notification of the pollution incident had not been made earlier as this would have made spraying more efficient and reduced potential risk. However, Irish Coast Guard director Chris Reynolds said he accepted the delegation’s explanation. The total cost of the Irish government's monitoring operation was estimated at €250,000.  Bilateral discussions were held with regards a Russian contribution towards these costs.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com5"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Siggins | first = Lorna | work = The Irish Times | title = Russian navy takes blame for oil slick off coast| date = 24 February 2009 | url =http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0224/1224241711699.html| accessdate = 2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
