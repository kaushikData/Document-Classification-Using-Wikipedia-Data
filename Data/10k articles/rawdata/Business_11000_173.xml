'''Australian Food and Grocery Council''' ('''AFGC''') represents [[Australia|Australia's]] food, drink and grocery manufacturing industry. AFGC's stated vision is for Australia's food, beverage and grocery manufacturing industry to be socially responsible and competing profitably domestically and overseas. The [[chief executive officer]] of the Australian Food and Grocery Council is former Liberal party politician, [[Kate Carnell]], who was Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) from 1995 to 2000.

They are a membership-based organisation totally funded by industry to work on behalf of industry in the following areas:

* '''Policy''' - Analyse and influence federal and state policies to ensure our members' views are represented at the highest level.
* '''Member Service''' - Offering a wide range of professional services specifically tailored to meet their members' needs.
* '''Programs''' - Providing targeted programs to deliver solutions for members and stakeholders.
* '''Representation and Advocacy''' - Presenting a united voice and advocate on behalf of the food and grocery manufacturing industry.
* '''Communication''' - Keeping members up to date, and promoting the industry.

==Political influence==
In November 2009, the AFGC successfully lobbied the [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]] to exempt agriculture and food processing from their [[emissions trading scheme]] negotiations for good. Dr [[Rosemary Stanton]] has argued this was a lost opportunity to reform the food industry and the health of Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2009/11/03/reform-the-food-industry-for-the-sake-of-the-planet/|title=Reform the food industry — for the sake of the planet|last=Stanton|first=Rosemary|publisher=Crikey.com.au|accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFGC has also supported advertisements for a business lobby group describing itself as "Responsible Recycling" that criticise the Northern Territory container deposit scheme as a verity of it

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16456">'''Business relations''' are connections between [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s in the process of businesses, such as [[employer]]–[[employee]] relationships, managers as well as outsourced [[business partner]]s. The association of businesses began relationships which have been constructed through communication channels such as the likes of [[telephone]]s, personal contacts, and [[e-mail]]s. These types of contacts  are maintained and deepened through similar channels in internal businesses and organizations.

Within the business of this era, the aim of many businesses whether small or internationally established is to develop a target to [[motivation|motivate]] all types of employees to form a professional relationship with one-another which will have many benefits to the business which will strongly lead to success. Furthermore, external business relationships are essential to any organization as it will improve the companies image, develop [[brand loyalty]], and improve sales.

There are many different forms through which business relations are maintained. Primarily, these relations as stated previously, constructed through [[communication]] channels however face-to-face interactions and the [[social media]] are seen to be the most effective allowing people to form stronger ties. There have been many research studies suggesting that multiple modes of communication are important to build strong business relationships. Face-to-face interactions are typically the most effective due to the in-person communication aspect, as it allows people to form stronger ties. The more communication and interaction there is  between two entities, the stronger the business relationship builds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smallbiztrends.com/2015/06/build-lasting-business-relationships.html|title=11 Ways to Build Solid, Lasting Business Relationships - Small Business Trends|website=smallbiztrends.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, internal business relations are important to maintain, as loyal employees can benefit the business by increasing profits. Moreover, loyal employees allow better relationships to be established with key suppliers and distributors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=W.Y. Yee|first1=Rachel|last2=Yeung|first2=Andy C.L.|last3=Cheng|first3=T.C.

Commitments of employees is therefore highly recommended for further positive influence on the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The new age employee: An exploration of changing employee-organization relations.|last = Mir|first = Ali|date = 2002|journal = Public Personnel Management|doi = 10.1177/009102600203100205|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Raza|first2 = Mir|issue = 2|pages = 187–200|last3 = Mosca|first3 = Joseph B.|volume = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Importance Of Loyalty and Trust in a Business ==

Business relations are important both externally and internally. Research has shown that "trust" is one of the most critical factors to develop and enhance effective long-term relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Yimin|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Ian F.|title=The dynamics and evolution of trust in business relationships|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|date=April 2013|volume=42|issue=3|pages=455–465|doi=10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.02.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether its with other business networks, individuals in a partnered firm or employees within the organization; who with a strong positive relationship can increase one or more of the following; long-term [[stock market]], [[employment rate]], [[productivity]], overall performance and other measures as  stated, with companies that are more aware and engaged with [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] matters, leading to a better performance level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karnes|first1=Roger Eugene|title=A Change in Business Ethics: The Impact on Employer–Employee Relations|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=12 August 2008|volume=87|issue=2|pages=189–197|doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9878-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, researchers of organizational behavior stress about organizational effectiveness being linked with employee's attribution. Therefore, creating an environment with employee satisfaction will hinder and solve such disagreements and arguments between one employee to another and the data will significantly preferable.

Moreover, as the business environment is constantly changing, it is causing firms to address new entrepreneurial innovative ideas that could out-stand them from the [[competition]]. Trust plays an important role in this as with developed business relations it allows one to react and initiate such innovative ideas to the business more effectively. There are two different types of trust that exists between business relations that affect one another, firstly " interpersonal" which refers to the individuals trust in one organization on other in the partnered organization. Secondly " inter organizational " which refers to members from the organization having a collective orientation or culture of trust towards a partner in a different organization.

With loyalty established internally in the organization and the employer aims and directs constant communication, the employer will form a strong relationship and bond between the employees and organizations; allowing them to feel more attached and sense commitment. This will result in a more motivated group of employees that will deliver high-quality services which is one of the key characteristics of  "[[social exchange]]". Delivering high quality services is essential as it allows organizations to gain customer satisfaction which gives a positive impact on the firm as customer satisfaction boosts [[customer loyalty]] and future behaviors. Customers become less concerned and sensitive towards prices as by being satisfied they tend to pay and tolerate such an increase in prices which in the long-term establishes a positive reputation as well as increasing the economic performance of the firm. Therefore, loyalty is essential in order to gain a strong employee relationship which can link to having a better customer loyalty, with time resulting in a more organized business that has a good flow of communication both internally and externally.

== Communication and Its Effect On Business Relations ==

Communication contact plays an important role in re-shaping the internal and external management in the organization. Communication cooperation internally can encourage " processes, strategies, activities, policies and programs" to be developed which enforce information and communication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wisner|first1=Joel D.|last2=Stanley|first2=Linda L.|title=Internal Relationships and Activities Associated with High Levels of Purchasing Service Quality|journal=The Journal of Supply Chain Management|date=June 1999|volume=35|issue=3|pages=25–32|doi=10.1111/j.1745-493X.1999.tb00059.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will have an effect on external relations which is considered to be rather important. Furthermore, establishing good communications at the beginning of the business between the employees, will provide the business with a positive reputation in the industry towards its rivalries and competitors in the market. Therefore, this could be constructed though the use of effective training programs and measurement systems.

Focusing on the internal aspect of communications, will allow external networks to trust the business by having the right perspective on the processes which may occur. This is due to the fact that communication is vital to sustain, especially when partnering with another company; whether its through [[mergers and acquisitions|merging]] or just joining a particular project. Therefore, the ability of associating with the right businesses is relevant in order to keep the company more innovative; as networks allow for " an effective transfer of information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geigenmüller|first1=Anja|last2=Mitręga|first2=Maciej|title=Network partner knowledge and internal relationships influencing customer relationship quality and company performance|journal=Journal of Business &amp; Industrial Marketing|date=27 July 2012|volume=27|issue=6|pages=486–496|doi=10.1108/08858621211251488}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, by gaining connections through networks; it can provide employee's, managers or owners to develop personal networks that can benefit oneself in the long term whether its towards a new entrepreneurial business plan, a project or even an incident that may occur within the business. An example is an entrepreneurial designer who used his personal connections in the industry to seek a potential supplier in China to continue developing his new business plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Ian F.|last2=Young|first2=Louise C.|title=Innovation and Evolution of Business Relations and Networks: Theory and Method |arxiv=1203.1332|date=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasizes on why obtaining and sustaining relations is beneficial for a business. Moreover, communication links with relationship marketing perfectly as both focus towards activities directed as establishing, developing and maintaining successful exchanges with customers and other constituents. (Morgan and Hunt 1994).

On the other hand, even though communication is a key concept to any business. Organizations should not fully depend on establishing only a few relations and shutting down others that may be beneficial, due to the fact that networking and developing relationships should not have limits. Engaging with new businesses frequently can provide positive change within the business by introducing new concepts and innovative ideas that keep up with the changes that take place in the industry regularly. Thus, businesses should accept some new organizations as well as keep close to old ones in order to sustain its position in the industry and adapt to the changes that take place.

To further extend, there are multiple ways of communicating within a business to improve relations whether its through technology, discussions in the office or through annual reports. More specifically, organizations are recommending the use of technological devices such a videoconferencing and teleconferencing which allows individuals to not be present at the same place but still be able to interact with one another, similarly the use of laptops and such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Dave|last2=Raffo|first2=Carlo|last3=Anderton|first3=Alain|title=Business studies.|date=2008|publisher=Causeway|location=Ormskirk|isbn=9781405892315|pages=446–455|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owners and managers consequently highlight the importance of communication in the business, especially in large organizations as there are longer layers in the [[hierarchy]] as well as more commitment.

'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'&lt;nowiki/&gt;''The effect of Social Media on business relationships'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''

Nowadays, Social Media plays an important role in establishing relationships. It is reported that there  is 1.5 billion social media users globally, with at least 70% of companies using some form of social media ([[McKinsey Global Institute]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The social economy: Unlocking value and productivity through social technologies|url = http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_social_economy|website = www.mckinsey.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many connections can be constructed through organizations  such as “ [[LinkedIn]]” where one can form new relations that can be beneficial in the longterm and contacts are usually made between individuals from different businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The art of business relationships through social media {{!}} Ivey Business Journal|url = http://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/the-art-of-business-relationships-through-social-media/|website = iveybusinessjournal.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Millennials|millennial generation]] more specifically are actively involved with social media on a daily basis and with the continuous change that is occurring in the industry, social media is essential for improving business performance and helping firms achieve a [[competitive advantage]]. In addition, (Cross and Katzenbach 2012 ) found that 90% of the information used for decision making came from informal networks rather than formal reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cross|first1=Rob|last2=Katzenbach|first2=Jon|title=The Right Role for Top Teams|url=http://www.strategy-business.com/article/00103?gko=97c39|website=www.strategy-business.com/|publisher=Strategy and Leadership|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships with Different Business Sizes ==

Business relations within a small organization differs from the regular as it is a mix of both formal and informal management. However, this depends on the internal management and more specifically the owners/managers own personal preferences. Even though this style of management is seen to be less flexible, it is more beneficial towards expanding in size and profitability. Many believe that with owners/managers, having both a formal and informal approach operations will occur more efficiently; resulting with a better positive outcome causing growth, an increase in profitability and a positive reputation between other competitors in the market, which is what every small business intends to achieve. In addition, small business control more than half of the market but many are seen to fail due to poor planning and inefficient external business relations.

Small businesses external relations are essential for success, an external relationship is defined as " a commercially oriented connected between a small business and other two organizations". The most known types are alliances and networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Street|first1=Christopher T.|last2=Cameron|first2=Ann-Frances|title=External Relationships and the Small Business: A Review of Small Business Alliance and Network Research*|journal=Journal of Small Business Management|date=April 2007|volume=45|issue=2|pages=239–266|doi=10.1111/j.1540-627X.2007.00211.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a relationship based on mutual interests and benefits as well as forming relationships within different organizations together into one. An example of forming an external relationship based on networking is engaging with a foreign organization, to increase financial gain and [[market share]] within the industry.This emphasizes the importance of forming external relationships, as this can push the business into having a more effective; higher position in the market, ahead of its competitors with greater brand awareness and recognition. Small businesses have a difficult time building good business relations as business relations is connected with such marketing performances and the need of having a good starting profit, time, planning and marketing expertise, therefore establishing strong external social ties from different organizations can strengthen the overall performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamprinopoulou|first1=Chrysoula|last2=Tregear|first2=Angela|title=Inter‐firm relations in SME clusters and the link to marketing performance|journal=Journal of Business &amp; Industrial Marketing|date=2 August 2011|volume=26|issue=6|pages=421–429|doi=10.1108/08858621111156412}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Économiesuisse''' is a [[Swiss]] [[Employers' organization|corporate union]], composed of the fusion of the '''Union suisse du commerce et de l'industrie''' ("Swiss union of commerce and industry") or '''[[Vorort]]''', and of the '''Société pour le développement de l'économie suisse''' ("society for development of Swiss economy").

== History ==
The USCI was founded in 1870, following a string of [[workers' strike]]s and demonstrations. In 1882, it was renamed Vorort.&lt;ref&gt;Grégoire NAPPEY, Histoire Suisse, lep, 2007, Lausanne, 94 pages, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed at favouring the interests of business owners.

From 1870 to 1882, the USCI lacked a permanent committee, and each member [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] would preside in rotation. From 1882, the USCI was re-organised around a nine-member direction organ, the Vorort, seating in [[Zurich]].

From 1931, the chambre Suisse du commerce, another organ of the USCI, was tasked with choosing the committee.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre CORDEY, Les Institutions ou Le Pouvoir chez les vaudois, 1974, Lausanne, 269 pages, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

After its fusion with the Société pour le développement de l'économie suisse, the USCI has been renamed Economiesuisse. According to its website, It represents some 100,000 companies, who employ 2 million workers. Its stated goals are promoting optimum work conditions for Swiss business, and promote enterprise freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economiesuisse.ch/en/vp-members|title=Members {{!}} economiesuisse|website=www.economiesuisse.ch|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also makes statements on [[taxes]], research, [[energy]] and environment, [[public health]] and [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economiesuisse.ch/en/topics|title=Topics {{!}} economiesuisse|website=www.economiesuisse.ch|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreira used his experience in advertising, public relations and promotional services to assist in the political campaigns of several like minded politicians, including Edgar Jara (candidate for president of Ecuador), [[Otto Pérez Molina]] (former constitutional president of Guatemala), and Susana Gonzalez (former leader in the Ecuadorian senate) through [[social media marketing]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Moreira founded the record label [[VIP Music Records]] and Fabrizio’s Talent Agency with the goal of building a pop culture platform that can be used to give media attention to political causes he cares about.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Political views==

Moreira is a member of Ecuador’s Social Christian Party and has a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] political ideology. In his political career, he has promoted ideas of free market policies and entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecuadorinmediato.com/Noticias/news_user_view/ecuadorinmediato_noticias--95813 |title=El Telegrafo (Guayaquil) Desempleo pone a prueba al Gobierno y a Empresarios |publisher=Ecuadorinmediato |date= |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he was accused&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecuadorinmediato.com/Noticias/news_user_view/ecuadorinmediato_noticias--85762|title=ONG niega participación venezolana en ataque opositor en Ecuador|date=|publisher=Ecuadorinmediato|accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; of promoting destabilizing activities&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.business.com/entrepreneurship/a-world-that-demands-political-change-on-a-global-scale-is-turning-to-the-entrepreneurial-spirit/|title=A World That Demands Political Change on a Global Scale is Turning to the Entrepreneurial Spirit|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the President of Ecuador, [[Rafael Correa]]. On behalf of the [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental organization]] CIT Ecuador, Moreira called the accusations "unfounded".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

That same year, Moreira organized a rally in support of political freedom called "Youth for a free democracy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2008/06/09/0001/8/5315E6CA71074958A0BF8A151DE330CD.html|title=Chávez y opositores vendrán al país - JUN. 09, 2008 - Política - Historicos - EL UNIVERSO|last=eluniverso.com.|website=www.eluniverso.com|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Manta during the visit of former Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez]] to Ecuador. The event was censored&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cambiemosecuador.com/2008/07/15/censura/|title=Censuran evento en la ciudad de Manta, Ecuador|date=|publisher=CambiemosEcuador.com|accessdate=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Chavez and Ecuadorian government officials,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/728811/-1/Foro_en_contra_de_Hugo_Ch%25C3%25A1vez.html#.V8V7wLUuueA|title=Foro en contra de Hugo Chávez : Manta : La Hora Noticias de Ecuador, sus provincias y el mundo|website=lahora.com.ec|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a government-mandated media blackout was in effect.

He was eventually forced to leave Ecuador, and now works as a political activist from his residence in Brooklyn, New York. He has since been invited to speak in Spain, Colombia, Chile, and Peru on the subject of economics and entrepreneurship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Failure of consideration''' is a technical [[legal]] term referring to situations in which one person confers a benefit upon another upon some condition or basis ("[[consideration]]") which fails to materialise or subsist. It is also referred to as "failure of basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1479&amp;context=blr |author=Camp T |title=Restitution on a Partial Failure of Basis}} (2016) 28 Bond Law Review 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an '[[English unjust enrichment law|unjust factor]]' for the purposes of the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]]. Where there is a "total failure of consideration" the claimant can seek restitution of the benefit by bringing an action in unjust enrichment against the defendant. Historically speaking, this was as a [[Quasi-contract|quasi-contractual]] claim known as an [[Money had and received|action for money had and received to the plaintiff's use]] for a consideration that wholly failed. The orthodox view is that it is necessary for any relevant contract to be ineffective, for example because it is discharged for [[Breach of contract|breach]], [[Void (law)|void]] ''ab initio'' (from the beginning) or [[Frustration in English law|frustrated]]. However, it will be available on a subsisting contract where it does not undermine the contractual allocation of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|153|2007|litigants=Coshott v Lenin |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure of consideration is a highly technical area of law. Particular areas of controversy include:
*Whether the failure of the consideration must be 'total',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UWALawRw/2006/6.pdf |last=Tarrant |first=J |title=Total Failure of Consideration}} (2006) 33(1) University of Western Australia Law Review 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and the scope and meaning of such a requirement;
*Whether 'consideration' refers not only to bargained-for counter-performance by the defendant, but also a legal or factual state of affairs;
*Whether this ground of restitution only applies to money claims or also extends to non-money benefits (e.g., [[Personal property|chattels]], services);  
*Whether this ground of restitution can be relied upon by a contract-breaker;
*Whether the (now ineffective) contract has any impact upon (a) the availability of a claim; or (b) the valuation of any such claim;  
*Whether a failure of consideration can also generate [[Unjust enrichment#Remedies for unjust enrichment: personal and proprietary restitution|proprietary remedies]] (e.g., a resulting trust);  
*Whether a claimant can elect to terminate a contract for breach and escape a 'bad bargain' by suing in unjust enrichment on the ground of total failure of consideration.

In [[filmmaking]], a '''guarantee''', or informally a '''"pay-or-play" contract''', is a term in a contract of an actor, director, or other participant that guarantees remuneration if the participant is released from the contract without being responsible.

Studios are reluctant to agree to guarantees but accept them as part of the deal for signing major talent. They also have the advantage of enabling a studio to remove a participant under such a contract, with few legal complications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmslaw.com/articles/art60.htm Navigating The "Pay Or Play" Minefield], ''The Business Of Film'' October 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Bonilla''' (born January 2, 1954) is a former congressman who represented [[Texas's 23rd congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. He was defeated in his bid for re-election by [[Ciro Rodriguez|Ciro Davis Rodriguez]], a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of Congress, in a [[special election]] runoff held on December 12, 2006. His term expired January 3, 2007 when the 110th Congress officially began.

==Roots in San Antonio==
Bonilla was born in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], the son of Anita Arellano and Enrique A. Bonilla.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/reps/bonilla.htm 1 "Henry Bonilla,"] ''Rootsweb.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was young he joined a TRIO [[Educational Talent Search]] program, which provides academic support and college awareness activities to students. He graduated from South San Antonio High School in 1972 and received his Bachelor of Journalism degree from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1976. Before entering politics, he was a television news executive at San Antonio's [[CBS]] affiliate, [[KENS-TV]]. His former wife, Deborah Knapp (born December 1, 1954), continues as an anchor at the station. He has since married the former Sheryl White Shelby (born 1959).

==Congressional career==
In March 1992, Bonilla won the 23rd district's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives ([https://web.archive.org/web/20050909082641/http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/preview/congdist/tx23_109.gif map]). The 23rd had been a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] district since its creation in 1967, but Bonilla charged four-term incumbent [[Albert G. Bustamante]] with neglecting his constituents' needs, being involved in the [[House banking scandal]] by writing 30 "cheques calientes" in the House Bank, and taking excessive and questionable junkets abroad.

Bonilla got an inadvertent assist from the state legislature, which left a heavily Republican area of western San Antonio in the 23rd while carving the new 28th District out of much of the 23rd's territory. Despite being outspent by $758,453 to $594,032 and being in a district that [[Bill Clinton]] carried the same year, Bonilla won by a huge 21-point margin, 59 to 38 percent, the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent that year.

In March 1999, Governor [[George W. Bush]] named Bonilla as the only Texan on his presidential [[exploratory committee]]. Bonilla often represented Bush on national news programs and as a surrogate speaker. Although the 23rd had a slight Democratic lean, Bonilla developed a very conservative voting record. Largely because of his popularity in San Antonio, he did not face a credible challenge until 2002, when Democrat [[Henry Cuellar]], a former Texas secretary of state, came within two points of unseating him.

Bonilla announced that he would probably run in 2006 for the [[United States Senate]] seat held by fellow Republican [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] if she ran for [[governor of Texas|governor]] in 2006 against the [[incumbent]] Republican [[Rick Perry]]. However, Hutchison decided to run for another term in the Senate.

==American Dream PAC==
When Bonilla took charge in 1999 of an independent political fund called American Dream PAC, he made clear that its mission was to "give significant, direct financial assistance to first-rate minority GOP candidates". However, between 1999 and the end of 2003, only $48,750 (or 8.9 percent) of the $547,000 the PAC has received, has gone to minority office-seekers, while more than $100,000 has been routed to Republican Party organizations or causes.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Bonilla defends his PAC's record of assisting minority candidates, saying, "We did the best we could." In all, 27 minority office-seekers, predominantly Hispanic-American, received money, mostly small donations. But Bonilla said it was sometimes difficult to find "good, solid minority candidates to expend the funds on". In July 2003, the treasurer of the PAC pleaded guilty to embezzling $119,021 between 1999 and 2003 and was sentenced to 15 months in prison. The thefts were not discovered until almost four years after they began. "It was a black mark on my judgment", Bonilla said in a 2004 interview.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==2003 redistricting==
Bonilla was priming for a rematch against Cuellar in 2004, but in 2003, a controversial [[2003 Texas redistricting|mid-decade redistricting]] by the Texas legislature, the results of efforts by U.S. House Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]], moved most of Laredo, which had been one of the cores of the 23rd since its formation, to the 28th district. In its place, Bonilla received several heavily Republican San Antonio suburbs that had previously been in the nearby 21st District, all but assuring him of a seventh term. Meanwhile, Cuellar entered and won the 2004 primary against the 28th's incumbent Democrat [[Ciro Rodriguez]] and then went on to win the general election.

Bonilla contributed money from his American Dream PAC to the redistricting effort.

Soon after the 2004 election, Bonilla was criticized when he proposed a procedural rule change that would permit House leaders to retain their leadership positions despite having been indicted by a state grand jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/stories/MYSA120306.2H.Bonilla2ed.221ba8a.html|author=Charles Babington|title=GOP Pushes Rule Change to Protect DeLay's Post|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=July 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625041055/http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/stories/MYSA120306.2H.Bonilla2ed.221ba8a.html|archive-date=June 25, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal would have allowed Tom DeLay to remain as Majority Leader despite having been indicted by the Travis County district attorney's office for possible campaign finance violations. Many constituents believed that Bonilla was blatantly repaying a political favor to DeLay for having favorably redrawn the 23rd District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/stories/MYSA120306.2H.Bonilla2ed.221ba8a.html|author=Staff|title=With seniority, Bonilla the better runoff option|date=December 2, 2006|publisher=My San Antonio Opinion|accessdate=July 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625041055/http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/stories/MYSA120306.2H.Bonilla2ed.221ba8a.html|archive-date=June 25, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2006, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], with Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] taking the lead, ruled in ''[[League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry]]'' that Bonilla's district violated the Civil Rights Act, although the justices upheld most of the 2003 redistricting. The Court declared that the Texas legislature violated the rights of Latino voters when it cut most of Laredo out of the 23rd. Although the reconfigured 23rd was still 55 percent Latino, only 46 percent of the district's voting-age population was Latino.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The justices held that as a result, the new district didn't have enough Latinos to pass muster under the [[Voting Rights Act]].  Since the legislature hadn't created an acceptable majority-Latino district (its intended replacement, the [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]-to-[[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]] [[Texas's 25th congressional district|25th]], was not considered compact enough), the reconfigured 23rd had to be struck down as well.  Because of the size of the 23rd, the ruling effectively forced the redrawing of nearly every district from El Paso to San Antonio. Precedent dictated that a new map had to be issued before the November elections.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The court issued the new lines on August 7. It moved all of Laredo out of the 23rd and into the 28th, but nevertheless made the district much friendlier to Democrats by boosting its Latino population to 65 percent. In particular, Bonilla lost many of the strongly Republican areas he had inherited in the 2003 redistricting. At the same time, he picked up much of heavily Democratic south San Antonio.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Bonilla had grown up in this area, which had been part of the 23rd from 1967-93. The court ordered an all-party primary on Election Day, with a December runoff if no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote. The new map included Rodriguez' home and much of his former base, and he announced that he would run against Bonilla in November. [[Federal Elections Commission]] records show Bonilla paid the [[Los Angeles]]-based law firm of [[Latham &amp; Watkins]] $100,000 in 2006, from his campaign funds, to argue that the district boundaries were constitutional. In February, the firm filed an ''amicus'' brief before the Supreme Court in support of the redistricting plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/001156.php|author=Justin Rood|title=Lawmaker Blew Big Bucks to Keep District Lines Unfair – to His Own Voters.|publisher=[[Talking Points Memo|TPM Muckraker]]|accessdate=July 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091428/http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/001156.php|archive-date=September 29, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defeat in 2006==
On November 7, Bonilla faced six Democrats, including [[Ciro Rodriguez]] and [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[Rick Bolanos]] in the all-candidate special election required by the court decision on redistricting (see above). The ballot also included one independent. Bolanos had won the Democratic primary earlier in the year.

In the first special election, Bonilla won 48 percent of the vote to Rodriguez's 20 percent. Since no one gained a majority, there was a runoff between the two former colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/politics/elections/16224956.htm] dead link.&lt;/ref&gt; According to unofficial results of the Texas Secretary of State [http://204.65.107.84/06decspcrun.htm?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;id=824]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Rodriguez won the runoff with 54% of the vote to Bonilla's 46%. Bonilla was the first Republican incumbent in Texas to be unseated by a Democrat in 10 years, since [[Nick Lampson]]'s defeat of [[Steve Stockman]] in a 1996 runoff election. Lampson was also returned to Congress in 2006 after being defeated for reelection in 2004, like Rodriguez in another district. Bonilla said in interviews the night of his defeat that his loss was in part a result of the changed districting. He ran controversial commercials that claimed that Rodriguez took funds from [[terrorist]]s, which media outlets called "bold claims". He later apologized to the press for any of those who took offense, but stood by his statement.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
[[Image:Bonilla Healthcare Facility, Laredo, TX IMG 2271.JPG|right|thumb|200px|&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;The Henry Bonilla Healthcare Facility off [[Texas State Highway 359]] South in [[Laredo, Texas]]&lt;/span&gt;]]
However, a large number of Hispanics and Latinos, who predominantly reside in District 23, had expressed disdain for Bonilla by stating that he had fallen out of touch with the needs and concerns of minorities. His reputation even earned him the nickname "Henry Vanilla", as some Hispanics claimed that Bonilla no longer could relate to his culture. In a year of war, illegal immigration issues, and a proposed border fence, Latinos left the Republicans side in droves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondchron.org/news/index.php?itemid=4016|author=Paul Hogarth|title=Latino Voters Bring Victory to Texas Democrats|publisher=Beyond Chron.org|accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failed nomination as ambassador==
After his term in Congress expired, Bonilla was nominated to be Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the [[Organization of American States]], with the rank of [[Ambassador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/03/20070315-5.html|author=Office of the Press Secretary|title=Personnel Announcement|publisher=The White House|accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two months with no action by the Senate, Bonilla asked U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] to withdraw his nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/one_item_and_teasers/nom_wdr.htm |author=United States Senate |title=Nominations Withdrawn |publisher=Senate.gov|accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the withdrawal of his ambassador nomination, Bonilla joined the Washington-based firm [http://www.thenormandygrp.com/ The Normandy Group].

==Consideration for Trump Cabinet==
In December 2016, Bonilla and two other Texas Republicans, [[Texas Agriculture Commissioner]] [[Sid Miller (politician)|Sid Miller]] and Miller's predecessor in that office, [[Susan Combs]], were interviewed for the position of [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'', December 31, 2016, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early life==
When he was 16 he came to the United Kingdom to learn English at a language school in [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="chm"&gt;{{citation|title=Oral History of Hermann Hauser|publisher=Computer History Museum|author=Gardner Hendrie|date=2014-06-20|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2015/04/102739951-05-01-acc.pdf|accessdate=2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a master's degree in Physics from [[Vienna University]],&lt;ref name="whoswho"/&gt; he returned to the [[University of Cambridge]] to do a PhD in Physics at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="whoswho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hauserphd"/&gt;

==Career==
Hauser is probably best known for his part in setting up [[Acorn Computers]] with [[Chris Curry]] in 1978. When [[Olivetti]] took control of Acorn in 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/5852/Olivetti-buy-49-of-Acorn-Computers/  | title=Olivetti buy 49% of Acorn Computers
 | publisher=Computing History | accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became vice-president for research at Olivetti, in charge of laboratories in the US and Europe. In 1986, Hauser co-founded the [[Olivetti Research Laboratory]] (ORL) in Cambridge with [[Andy Hopper]], who became the laboratory's director. Hauser's role in Acorn was portrayed by [[Edward Baker-Duly]] in the [[BBC]] drama ''[[Micro Men]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1459467|Micro Men (TV 2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00n5b92 | title=BBC Four Programmes Micro Men | publisher=BBC| accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Hauser left Olivetti to start the Active Book Company, investing £1 million of his own money. Not wanting to repeat the mistakes made by Acorn, which had kept its technology to itself, he demonstrated the Active Book to as many large companies as he could. [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] acquired Active Book and incorporated it into [[EO Personal Communicator]] in July 1991. Hauser became chief technical officer and chairman of EO Europe. EO folded on 29 July 1994.

In 1990, Hauser was involved in spinning out [[ARM Holdings|Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)]] from Acorn.

In 1993, Hauser set up [[Advanced Telecommunication Modules Ltd]] with Andy Hopper. The company was acquired by Conexant Systems on 1 March 2004. He founded NetChannel Ltd in June 1996 as a holding company to begin work on marketing the NetStation. NetChannel was sold to AOL in 1996.&lt;ref name="irishtimes lillington 2012"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2012/1108/1224326306603.html | title=From little Acorn grew an angel investor with an eye for the next big thing | work=[[The Irish Times]] | date=8 November 2012 | accessdate=12 November 2012 | author=Lillington, Karlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed in the 1990s that the networking technology used for [[AppleTalk]] was based on the (unpatented) [[Cambridge Ring (computer network)|Cambridge Ring]].&lt;ref name="compmus"&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.poppyfields.net/acorn/docs/armdocs/hauser.shtml | title = Missing The Big Time|first = Wendy | last = Grossman | journal = Personal Computer World Magazine |date=May 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired anderson 1996"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Christopher|title=Herman Hauser's Second Chance|url=http://yoz.com/wired/2.05/features/hauser.html|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=[[Wired UK]]|date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 he co-founded [[Amadeus Capital Partners]] Ltd,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} a venture capital company, and in 1998 he co-founded [[Cambridge Network]] with [[David Cleevely]] and [[Alec Broers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://my.safaribooksonline.com/0130654159/ch11lev1sec11 | title=A Gentle Persuasion to Collaborate – Organizing and Building the Cambridge Network | publisher=Safari Books Online | accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Plastic Logic]] was founded, with Hauser as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 2001, the Hauser-Raspe Foundation was registered as a charity by Hauser and Pamela Raspe to advance education.

In August 2004, Amadeus Capital Partners led the Series B [[venture capital financing]] of Solexa, and Hauser joined its board of directors. Solexa developed a next-generation DNA sequencing technology which became the market leader; the company was sold to [[Illumina (company)|Illumina, Inc]] of San Diego in January 2007 for over $US600 million.

'''Itthipat Peeradechapan''' ({{lang-th|อิทธิพัทธ์ พีระเดชาพันธ์}}, {{RTGS|Itthiphat Phiradechaphan}}, surname changed from '''Kulapongvanich''' ({{lang|th|กุลพงษ์วณิชย์}}) in 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=แช้ต..แช้ต: เปลี่ยนนามสกุล|work=Thai Post|date=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; nicknamed '''Tob''' ({{lang|th|ต๊อบ}}), is a Thai entrepreneur.

He is most well known for his product [[Tao Kae Noi]], a fried [[seaweed]] snack, which is sold around the Asia-Pacific area. He and his family own 73% of the company and Forbes estimated his wealth at $390 million in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karmali|first1=Naazneen|title=Thailand's Rising Stars Are On The Road To Riches|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/naazneenkarmali/2016/06/01/thailands-rising-stars-are-on-the-road-to-riches|work=Forbes|date=1 June 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man, Itthipat gained success at playing online games and winning tournament prizes. He invested his money into selling fried [[chestnut]]s, which became popular in Thailand. With this financial backing, he went on to create the product of packaged deep fried flavored seaweed, which quickly became successful in Thailand, and was exported to [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[United States]].

A Thai movie, ''[[The Billionaire]]'', was loosely based on his life. The title refers to his status as a billionaire in Thai baht.

== Early life ==
Itthipat herminigildo was born in November 24, 1984 in Thailand and of Chinese ethnicity. He was born into a wealthy family and did not think too much about the future. He attained his education from kindergarten and elementary at Panapun Wittaya School, high school at St. Francis Xavier School and senior from Suankularb Wittayalai Nonthaburi School. He obtained his bachelor's degree in business administration from the [[University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce]].

== Business career ==
When he was still 16 years old, he was addicted to online games. Even though he gained success at playing online games and winning tournament prizes because of his hobby playing online games, he was often underestimated by his teachers at school. He decided to drop out from school to become a chestnut peddler when he was 17 years old. He invested his money into selling fried chestnuts, which became popular in Thailand.

In 2004, Itthipat founded Tao Kae Noi (Little Tycoon) Food and Marketing Co., Ltd. The brand sold fried seaweed snacks, which became highly popular among teenagers and officer workers. In December 2015, the company had its initial public offer (IPO) on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, raising 1.8 billion baht.  His success has made him popular among business circles and media. The company reported a net profit of 160 million baht in its third quarter in 2017. Itthipat has said he targets revenue of 1 billion baht in 7–8 years.

'''Jacques Lebaudy''' (1868 - January 11, 1919) was a Frenchman from a wealthy family of sugar refiners known for his eccentricity and his attempt to establish a new nation, the Empire of the Sahara. The circumstances of his death in 1919 in [[Westbury, New York|Westbury, Long Island]], resulted in a sensational grand jury proceeding.

==Family and early life==
Born in 1868, Jacques Lebaudy was the oldest son of Jules Lebaudy (1828-1892), who with his brother Gustave (1827-1889) owned the family sugar refining business, [[Lebaudy Frères]]. Jules also owned property in Paris, including the [[Théâtre du Vaudeville]]. Jacques' mother Amicie (1847-1917) founded a charity to provide low-cost housing to the working poor which is still in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fondationlebaudy.fr|title=Accueil - Fondation de Madame Jules Lebaudy|last=|first=|date=|website=Fondation de Madame Jules Lebaudy|language=fr-FR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Jacques' younger brother Max (1873-1895) in a military hospital in 1895 after being called up for military service despite a serious illness caused a scandal in France. Lebaudy had inherited about $15 million on the death of his father.

Jacques' cousins Paul and Pierre Lebaudy were notable builders of airships, such as [[La République (airship)|''La République'']].

==The Empire of the Sahara==
[[File:Drapeau Empire Du Sahara.gif|thumb|Flag of the Empire of the Sahara]]
In June 1903, Lebaudy sailed with his yacht ''Frasquita'' and two other boats to an area near [[Cape Juby]] on the Moroccan coast and proclaimed the "Empire of the Sahara". Backed by as many as 400 hired soldiers and sixteen [[Hotchkiss gun]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Current Literature'', October 1903, p. 412-3&lt;/ref&gt; Lebaudy established a camp and set up a throne for himself in a large tent. He had various projects for ruling and improving his new domain, but European governments disapproved of his venture, and some of his mercenaries were captured by local Moorish bandits. (They later sued Lebaudy for damages for abandoning them, after being rescued by a French warship.&lt;ref&gt;"Empire Building" in ''Occasional, Critical, and Political Writings'', [[James Joyce]], Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 100 - 101&lt;/ref&gt;) By October 1903 Lebaudy was installed at the [[Savoy Hotel]] in London, and soon installed his government there, appointing American adventurer [[George Edward Gouraud]] as his "Governor-General".&lt;ref&gt;"Emperor of the Sahara", ''Oamaru Mail'', 28 January 1904, Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: George Gouraud was not closely related to [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|Henri Gouraud]], a French officer active at that time in West Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly the orchestra in the Savoy restaurant would play his national anthem whenever he entered to dine under his imperial purple canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-emperor-of-the-sahara-1198247.html|title=The Emperor of the Sahara|last=Maxwell|first=Bennet|date=15 September 1998|work=The Independent|access-date=16 October 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years the embarrassed French government issued a warrant for his arrest and Lebaudy left North Africa for good.

==United States==
About 1908 Lebaudy moved to the United States with his wife Augustine and daughter Jacqueline, residing mostly in expensive New York City hotels, and his behavior became more erratic. In 1915 he was placed in an asylum at the request of his wife; he at first fled the local sheriff on horseback, before surrendering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/08/19/104652535.pdf|title=Emperor of the Sahara surrenders to U.S.|last=|first=|date=19 August 1915|work=New York Times|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but soon escaped,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/08/20/105038289.pdf|title=Sahara's 'Emperor' Flees Sanitarium|last=|first=|date=20 August 1915|work=New York Times|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;only to be recaptured after a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ezproxy.slv.vic.gov.au/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.slv.vic.gov.au/docview/145414535|title=Emperor goes cattle shopping|last=|first=|date=24 August 1915|work=Washington Post (1877-1922)|access-date=17 October 2018|subscription=yes|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lebaudy reportedly tried several times to have his wife and daughter killed, and was finally shot and killed by his wife on January 11, 1919 at her home in Westbury on [[Long Island|Long Island.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19190322.2.125|title=Jaques Lebaudy "Emperor of the Sahara" shot dead by his wife"|last=|first=|date=22 March 1919|work=Evening Post|access-date=16 October 2018|via=Papers Past}}&lt;/ref&gt; A grand jury refused to indict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/01/22/97060820.pdf|title=Clear Mrs.Lebaudy of killing husband|last=|first=|date=22 January 1919|work=New York TImes|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left a large estate, having inherited additional portions of the family money from his brother Max and his mother. He also had the reputation, despite his mental problems, of being at times a shrewd investor in stocks and property; he reportedly made a profit of over $1,000,000 in the stock of the [[Erie Railroad]] in 1907 when it became the subject of a takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/01/12/103454944.pdf|title=Jaques Lebaudy shot dead by his wife in her home|last=|first=|date=12 January 1919|work=New York TImes|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebaudy was buried in the Catholic parish cemetery of St. Brigid's, Westbury, now part of the Catholic [[Cemetery of the Holy Rood]].

In 1922 his wife remarrried a French detective in a double wedding with her daughter, who married his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SU19221005.2.55&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1|title=Widow of Jacques Lebaudy and Daughter Have Double Wedding|last=|first=|date=5 October 1922|work=Sacramento Union|access-date=16 October 2018|issue=26134|volume=228|page=2|via=California Digital Newspaper Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Henry Van Alen II''' (September 19, 1902 – July 3, 1991) was an American tennis official.  He is best known for being the founder of the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]], the largest tennis museum in the world. A poet, musician, publisher, civic leader and raconteur, Jimmy Van Alen achieved his greatest renown in tennis. His greatest legacies are as the inventor of the [[tiebreak]] in tennis, and as founder and primary benefactor of the International Tennis Hall of Fame and Museum at the Newport Casino, which he gave to the United States Tennis Association in 1954, saving the national landmark from a proposed car park.

==Biography==
Van Alen was born on September 19, 1902, in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], United States, to James Laurens Van Alen (1878–1927) and [[Margaret Van Alen Bruguiére|Margaret Louise Post]] (1876–1969). His paternal grandparents were [[James J. Van Alen|James John Van Alen]] (1848–1923) and Emily Astor (1854–1881) of the [[Astor family]]. These and other details are found in his 2010 biography&lt;ref&gt;Dwight, Eleanor. ''Jimmy Van Alen and Tennis in the 20th Century'. New York: MT Train/Scala Books, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated in 1924 from [[Cambridge University]] where he was a member of [[Christ's College, Cambridge |Christ's College]] and won his [[Cambridge blue |blue]] for [[Cambridge University Lawn Tennis Club |Lawn Tennis]].  He was a member of the [[Hawks' Club]] in Cambridge where the main lounge is named the 'Jimmy Van Alen Room'.  He was an avid tennis player and was a national singles and doubles champion in [[court tennis]].

He helped found the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1954 at the [[Newport Casino]] in Newport, Rhode Island.  One of his contributions to the game was the development of the '''Van Alen Streamlined Scoring System''' (VASSS) which, among other elements, advocated a sudden-death tie breaker to end prolonged sets and matches. Van Alen actively promoted his system and in 1970 the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S Open]] became the first Grand Slam tournament to introduce, on an experimental basis, the tie-break. Initially it was a best-of-nine-points, sudden death tie-break which made it possible to have simultaneous match points for both players. Via a few intermediary steps this would evolve into the current best-of-twelve-point tie-break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimsley|first=Will|title=Tennis: Its History, People and Events|year=1971|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0139033777|pages=26–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tignor|first1=Steve|title=1970: The Tiebreaker Is Introduced|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/02/1970-tiebreaker-introduced/54116/|website=tennis.com|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 1965.

He was a great fan of [[Clement C. Moore]]'s famous poem ''A Visit from Saint Nicholas'' which is more commonly known as ''[[Twas the Night Before Christmas]]''. He purchased and restored the Clement C. Moore house on Catherine Street in Newport, RI and would make an annual public reading of the poem to children during the Christmas season.

He died after striking his head in a fall at his home on July 3, 1991. He is buried with his wife at the Berkeley Memorial Cemetery at Saint Columba's Chapel in Middletown, Rhode Island.

==Legacy==
Two days after his death, on July 5, 1991, in a [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] semifinal, [[Stefan Edberg]] lost to [[Michael Stich]] 6&amp;ndash;4, 6&amp;ndash;7&lt;sup&gt;(5&amp;ndash;7)&lt;/sup&gt;, 6&amp;ndash;7&lt;sup&gt;(5&amp;ndash;7)&lt;/sup&gt;, 6&amp;ndash;7&lt;sup&gt;(2&amp;ndash;7)&lt;/sup&gt;. Edberg did not lose serve. Later, after hearing of Van Alen's death, Edberg said: "If he hadn't lived, Michael and I might still be out there playing".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18213">A '''marketing information system''' ('''MKIS''') is a [[management information system]] (MIS) designed to support [[marketing]] [[decision making]]. Jobber (2007) defines it as a "system in which marketing data is formally gathered, stored, analysed and distributed to [[management|manager]]s in accordance with their informational needs on a regular basis." In addition, the online business dictionary defines Marketing Information System (MKIS) as "a system that analyzes and assesses marketing information, gathered continuously from sources inside and outside an organization or a store."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/marketing-information-system.html Marketing information system], Business Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, "an overall Marketing Information System can be defined as a set structure of procedures and methods for the regular, planned collection, analysis and presentation of information for use in making marketing decisions." (Kotler, at al, 2006)

== Overview ==
Reid and Bojanic(2010) claimed that, " The term market research informs relatively narrowerly than Marketing Information System(MkIS) which is altered from the term management information [[systemization]]. Market research indicates that information is not collected for a specific reason or project; the major objective is a one-time use. "&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hospitality Marketing Management|last = Reid|first = Robert D.|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons,Inc.|year = 2010|isbn = 9780470088586|location = New Jersey|pages = 209|last2 = Bojanic|first2 = David C.|edition = 5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A marketing information system, which continuously collects the initial, routine and systematic data, is not only used for one particular topic but is designed for monitoring the degree of the marketing success to ensure the achievable of the operation as well."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Importance ==
Developing a MKIS system is becoming extremely important as the strength of economies rely on services and to better understand the specific needs of customers.   Kotler, et al. (2006) defined it more broadly as "people, equipment, and procedures to gather, sort, analyze, evaluate, and distribute needed, timely, and accurate information to marketing decision makers."&lt;ref name="Kotler"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kotler |first=Philip |authorlink= Philip Kotler |author2=Keller, Kevin Lane |authorlink2=Kevin Lane Keller  |editor= |others= |title=Marketing Management |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= 12 |series= |year=2006 |publisher=Pearson Education |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as an economy focuses on services, marketing is important to "monitor the marketing environment for changes in [[buyer behavior]] competition, technology, economic conditions, and government policies."&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Harmon. (2003). Marketing Information Systems. Encyclopedia of Information Systems, Vol. 3. Elsevier Science (USA), 137-151.&lt;/ref&gt;   In this sense, the role of marketing is becoming pivotal for an organization to "adapt to changes in the market environment." (Harmon, 2003)

As an economy relies on the acquisition of knowledge, MkIS systems are necessary to be able to define and differentiate the [[value proposition]] that one organization provides with respect to another, as well as to define their [[competitive advantage]]. (Harmon, 2003)

The main benefit of MkIS systems is to integrate market-monitoring systems with strategy development and the strategic implementation of policies and processes that help capture and act on [[customer management]] applications with marketing [[decision support system]]s.  This area constitute [[Marketing intelligence]] that supports the analysis and market based activities that support customer relations and customer service with real time information with real time applications that support market based approaches.

=== Relevance of MkIS ===
Shajahan and arya(2004) stated that, "Demands for the MkIS can be expressed by three crucial developments. Firstly, when companies expand and diversify into new markets, both the companies and customer's point of view are needed to be handled by the marketing managers. Therefore, there would be greater need for marketing information. Secondly, when consumers obtain an increment in the level of their income, it causes a tendency for them to be more discriminating during the purchasing procedure. A full awareness of the points that drive a consumer prefer a brand and the points that distinguished his brand from that of the rivals should be obtained by the marketers. This awareness is possible only with the help of a well- designed effective MkIS. Thirdly, the development of the markets and the movement from price to non-price grounds of competition lead to an increase in the importance of adoption and implementation by the competitors and finding the response of the consumers towards them. Analyzing the needs for MkIS from a third person's angle, three more factors come to the forefront viz., the information explosion, increasing complexity in decision making and the technological developments. " &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Management Information Systems|last = Shajahan|first = S.|publisher = New Page International(P) Ltd.|year = 2004|isbn = 8122415490|location = India|pages = 99|last2 = Priyadharshini|first2 = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing Research(MR)and MkIS ===

In addition, "Great demand of information gathering for marketing decisions results in the need of attention by themselves.  Though marketing research information can be generated by studies, which are normally conducted in the market place whereas marketing information systems are designed to gather, integrate, process and distribute marketing information comprehensively from all sources, including that from marketing research. The contrasting characteristics of MkIS and MR are presented in Table 5.1 as shown below:

The business function of marketing is concerned more with the planning, promotion and sale of products in existing markets and the development of new products and new markets. Thus marketing performs a vital function in the operation of a business enterprise. Business firms who turned to computers have been able to perform vital marketing function effectively for organizations' growth in the face of global competition."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Main Structure ==
According to Robert Jamon (2003), MkIS systems are decomposed on four components: (1) user interfaces, (2) application software, (3) databases, and (4) system support.   The following is a description of each one of these components.

1. [[User interfaces]]. The essential element of the MAkINAS is the managers who will use the system and the interface they need to effectively analyze and use marketing information.  The design of the system will depend on what type of decision managers need to make.

2. [[Application software]]. These are the programs that marketing decision makers use to collect, analyze, and manage data for the purpose of developing the information necessary for marketing decisions.

3. [[Database marketing]]. A marketing database is a system in which marketing data files are organized and stored.

4. [[IBM System/34, 36 System Support Program|System support]]. This component consists of system managers who manage and maintain the system assets including software and hardware network, monitor its activities and ensure compliance with organizational policies.

Along with these components, MkIS systems include [[Marketing decision support system|Marketing Decision Support Systems]] (MDSS), which in turn rely on simple systems such as [[Microsoft Excel]], [[SPSS]], and on-line analytical tools that help collect data.  Data compiled for analysis is stored and processed from a [[data warehouse]], which is simply a [[Information repository|data repository]] system that helps store and further process data collected internally and externally. (Harmon, 2003)

=== Databases ===
From Pride and Ferrell (2010), "Internal database is a part of the most marketing information systems. In addition, it's relatively convenient for access and retrieve of information. A databases allow marketers to tap into an abundance of information useful in making marketing decisions: internal sales reports, newspaper articles, company news releases, government economic reports, bibliographies, and more, often accessed through a computer system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marketing|last = Pride|first = William M.|publisher = Cengage Learning,Inc.|year = 2010|isbn = 9780547167473|location = Canada|pages = 148|last2 = Ferrell|first2 = O.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internal Data ====
In with Birn(2004), " internal data is a part of the data that is needed to be collect and handled by the marketing information system. Further more, managers regard this as a command to make effective operation.But getting the information that is really needed from a marketing information system depends on what the information is and how it is used. The following internal operating data are essential:
* Sales data, presented in a graphic format, can provide regular sales trend information and highlight whether certain customer types need to be targeted or focused.
* Price information by product line, compare with competitors, can monitor market trends; analyzed by customer type, it can check price trends in customer groups.
* Stock level data and trends in key accounts or distributors, focusing on whether different outlets need support, provide market share information.
* Market support information, coordinating the effects of marketing promotions, through advertising, direct marketing, trade incentives, consumer competitions and so on, helps to determine whether decisions are being made effectively.
* Competitive information, reviewing competitors'  promotions and communications to see if the company is doing it better or worse than competitors, can improve market targeting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Effective Use of Market Research: How to Drive and Focus Better Business Decisions|last = Birn|first = Robin|publisher = Kogan Page Limited|year = 2004|isbn = 074944200X|location = Great Britain|pages = 22|edition = 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental scanning ===
Sandhusen(2000) defined that, environmental scanning is a display of the nature of MIS processed. " It gives assistance for the marketers to develop the strategies, policies, plans and to make programs and budgets through dealing with the ongoing information on trends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marketing|last = Sandhusen|first = Richard L.|publisher = Barron's Educational Series|year = 2000|isbn = 9780764112775|location = Canada|pages = 165|edition = 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kotler's Model ===
According to Philip Kotler, the four components that comprise the MkIS system are Internal Reports (Records) System, Marketing Research System, Marketing Intelligence System, and Marketing Decision Support System

1.Internal Reports System: It records various data from different department of a company, which is regarded as a major source of information.

2.Marketing Intelligence System: It is a main source used by managers for gaining daily information of the external environment, hence assists the managers to react to the changing rapidly.

3.Marketing Research System: It is used to collect primary and secondary data, and displays the results in forms of reports.

4.Marketing Decision Support System: Compared to the supply of the data by the three previous systems, it focuses more on processing the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/marketing/mis-marketing-information-system-with-diagram/48703/|title = MIS: Marketing Information System (With Diagram)|date = 2015|accessdate = 1 Nov 2015|website = YourArticleLibrary|publisher = |last = Jaideep|first = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages , Limitations &amp; Possible Risks ==

=== Advantages ===
Bhasin stated that,"With an increasingly competitive and expanding market, the amount of information needed daily by an organization is profound. So they have to establish a Marketing Information system. There are several advantages of Marketing information systems

* '''Organized Data collection''' –  MkIS can help the managers to organize loads of data collected from the market, thus results in an increment in the productivity.
* '''A broad perspective''' –  With a proper MkIS in place, the organization can be tracked which can be used to analyze independent processes. This helps in establishing a broader perspective which helps us know which steps can be taken to facilitate improvement.
* '''Storage of Important Data''' – The storage of important data is essential in execution and thus proves again that MkIS is not important only for information but also for execution.
* '''Avoidance of Crisis''' – The best way to analyze a stock (share market) is to see its past performance. Top websites like moneycontrol thrive on MIS. Similarly MIS helps you keep tracks of margins and profits. With an amazing information system established, an organizations direction can be analysed and probably crises averted before they place. 
* '''Co-ordination''' –  Consumer durables and FMCG companies have huge number of processes which needs to be co-ordinated. These companies depend completely on MIS for the proper running of the organization.
* '''Analysis and Planning''' –  MkIS plays a crucial role in the planning process, considering the planning procedure requires information. For planning, the first thing which is needed is the organizations capabilities, then the business environment and finallycompetitor analysis. In a proper MkIS, all these are present by default and are continuously updated. Therefore, MkIS is very important for planning and analysis.
* '''Control''' –  Just like MkIS can help in a crisis, in normal times it provides control as you have information of the various processes going on and what is happening across the company."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.marketing91.com/customer-profitablity-analysis-2/|title = 8 Advantages of Marketing Information Systems|date = 23 Oct 2015|accessdate = 23 Oct 2015|website = Marketing 91|publisher = |last = Bhasin|first = Hitesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible risks ===
"Nevertheless, the collection of marketing information should obey a high-frequent manner due to the rapid change in the external market." The possible risks the business may face if they disobey the manner according to Bhasin are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.marketing91.com/mis-marketing-information-system/|title = MIS – Marketing information system|date = 23 Oct 2015|accessdate = 23 Oct 2015|website = Marketing 91|publisher = |last = Bhasin|first = Hitesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Opportunities may be missed.
* There may be a lack of awareness of environmental changes and competitors' actions.
* [[Data collection]] may be difficult to analyze over several time periods.
* Marketing plans and decisions may not be properly reviewed.
* Data collection may be disjointed.
* Previous studies may not be stored in an easy to use format.
* Time lags may result if a new study is required.
* Actions may be reactionary rather than anticipatory.

Maintenance, complexity and setting up a MkIS are one of the major hindrances to Marketing information systems. Furthermore, wrong information being fed in MkIS can become cumbersome and appropriate filters need to be established.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Limitations ===
Kotler and Philip have said that "both primary and secondary researches offer loads of the data and information needed for the marketers, whereas the secondary data sources are relatively superior in quick provision of data at lower cost. Simultaneously, a firm cannot find all the data required by itself, but sometimes can be done with the help of secondary research. However, researchers must assess those data collected from both primary and secondary data sources to enable the accuracy, updates and fairness.  Each primary data collection method – observational, survey, and experimental – has its own advantages and disadvantages. Similarly, each of the various research contact methods – mail, telephone, personal interview, and online – also has its own advantages and drawbacks." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Marketing|last = Kotler|first = Philip|publisher = Pearson Education,Inc.|year = 2010|isbn = 9780137006694|location = United States of America|pages = 153|last2 = Armstrong|first2 = Gary|edition = 13th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rural Marketing Information System (RuMIS) ==
A RuMIS is necessary not only for corporate organizations engaged in marketing of agricultural goods and manufactured goods intended for sales in rural areas. RuMIS is required also by the agriculturists and farmers who have enormous decis!ion-making to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rural Marketing: Indian Perspective|last = Singh|first = Awadhesh Kumar|publisher = New Age International (P) Ltd.|year = 2005|isbn = 8122416837|location = India|pages = 114|last2 = Pandey|first2 = Satyaprakash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Michael Edwardes''' (born 11 October 1930)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Michael Edwardes|url=http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/e/16007/Michael%20Owen+EDWARDES.aspx|work=Debretts|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a British-South African business executive.

==Biography==
Edwardes matriculated from [[St. Andrew's College (Grahamstown, South Africa)|St. Andrew's College]] in 1947 before graduating from [[Rhodes University]]. He began his career in 1951 with the [[Chloride Group]]. He went on in 1966 to serve as the general manager of Alkaline Batteries, one of the groups operating companies at Redditch, Worcestershire UK. He later joined the Chloride main board and became Chief Executive in 1971 and remained in that position until 1977  

He was appointed to the UK's [[National Enterprise Board]], a [[QUANGO]] whose role was to provide financing to large UK state-owned enterprises (or nationalized industries), including the country's ailing motor giant, [[British Leyland]], when it was established in 1975.  

In 1977 he was appointed as chief executive of [[British Leyland]], and within two weeks he became chairman as the company's board was 'pruned' from 13 to 7 members.&lt;ref name=Motor197711&gt;{{cite magazine| authorlink=Roger Bell (Ed)|title=MotorWeek: Surgery for survival|magazine=[[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]|volume=152: nbr 3919|page=2|date=26 November 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 he was knighted in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref name=Motor1979&gt;{{cite magazine|authorlink=Unsigned|title=Newsflashes|magazine=[[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]|volume=155 nbr 4002|page=4|date=23 June 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The next year, in 1980 he attracted criticism for a speech to the CBI Conference in which he said, "If the Cabinet do not have the wit and imagination to reconcile our industrial needs with the fact of [[North Sea oil]], they would do better to leave the bloody stuff in the ground."{{sfn|Edwardes|1983}}

His tenure with British Leyland lasted until 1982, when he was replaced by [[Harold Musgrove]].

In 1982, on his retirement from British Leyland as CEO, Sir Michael Edwardes was presented with a British Racing Green Jaguar XJS.  He later had this car shipped to South Africa, where he used it for board meetings at General Motors South Africa in 1988.

In 1984, he became Chairman of [[International Computers Limited|ICL]], but resigned six months later when the company was acquired by [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]].

Edwardes wrote ''Back from the Brink'', a book which discusses his experiences at [[British Leyland]].

He donated over [[South African Rand|R]]500,000 to [[St. Andrew's College (Grahamstown, South Africa)|St. Andrew's College]] in 2005. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[File:Neil Rackham Professional.jpg|thumb|]]

'''Neil Rackham''' is an author, consultant and academic. His writing focuses on "consultative selling," an approach he pioneered and documented in his book SPIN Selling (McGraw-Hill).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/SPIN-Selling-Neil-Rackham/dp/0070511136&lt;/ref&gt;

Rackham has been a consultant to executives and board members at more than 40 of the U.S. Fortune 500 companies, including IBM, Xerox, AT&amp;T, Citicorp, GE, Microsoft, and Oracle, as well as to professional services organizations such as KPMG, Booz Allen, and McKinsey &amp; Co..{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}

He is currently a visiting professor at Portsmouth University, Cranfield School of Management, and Sheffield University, all in his native England, as well as at the University of Cincinnati, and is a frequent lecturer at conferences, business schools, and corporations around the world.

== Early life ==

Neil Rackham was born in [[England]] and spent some of his early years in [[Borneo]]. He was later educated at Totton Grammar School, Hampshire, England and then studied [[psychology]] at [[Sheffield University]] where he was awarded a bachelor's degree in 1966.

He continued as a post-graduate research fellow in psychology at Sheffield through 1969, developing new tools to study and measure the role of interpersonal skills in successful negotiating and selling.

== Career ==

Rackham’s work as a research fellow led to his first books, The Evaluation of Management Training (Gower Press, 1970), written with Peter B. Warr and Michael William Bird;  Developing Interactive Skills (Wellens Publishing, 1971), co-authored with Peter Honey and Michael J. Colbert; and Behaviour Analysis in Training (McGraw-Hill UK, 1977), with Terry Morgan.

From 1970 to 1974, Rackham served as managing director of Performance Improvement Ltd., improving high-level job skills for clients such as IBM, BP, British Airways, Xerox and Honeywell.

In 1974, he founded the Huthwaite Research Group, which later became Huthwaite Inc., a global research and consulting firm based in Northern Virginia, and, Huthwaite Ltd., based in the United Kingdom.

Having developed methods for measuring interactive behavior in his research fellowship, Rackham produced a series of seminal articles that focused on practices and behavior associated with successful negotiations:&lt;ref&gt;Developing NEGOTIATING skills, Neil Rackham, Industrial and Commercial Training, Volume: 4 Issue: 6, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Effective Negotiator — Part I: The Behaviour of Successful Negotiators, Neil Rackham, John Carlisle, Journal of European Industrial Training, Volume: 2 Issue: 6, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Effective Negotiator — Part 2: Planning for Negotiations, Neil Rackham, John Carlisle, Journal of European Industrial Training, Volume: 2 Issue: 7, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Deciding to apply these same methods to the world of sales and explore effective behaviors in successful business-to-business selling, Rackham sought the support of major multinational companies including Xerox and IBM, and raised an initial $1 million for a landmark study.

The project, the first to scientifically measure selling and buying behavior and by far the largest study of its kind{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}, involved a team of 30 researchers who studied 35,000 sales calls in over 20 countries. The research spanned 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://neilrackham.com/bio/&lt;/ref&gt;

It led to the publication of Making Major Sales (Gower Press, 1988), a book that had a tremendous impact on the world of sales in Europe{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}, and then to two New York Times business bestsellers — SPIN Selling (McGraw-Hill, 1988) and, one year later, Major Account Sales Strategy (McGraw-Hill) — earning international acclaim for its author.

The theories behind these books, seen as controversial at first,&lt;ref&gt;http://ultimatesalesexecresource.blogspot.com/2013/02/warning-to-ceos-resist-temptation-of.html&lt;/ref&gt; have since been recognized as game-changers in the world of selling.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}

===SPIN Selling===

At the time, the conventional wisdom in the sales world was that "selling was selling" - that the techniques that were successful in smaller consumer sales worked equally well in more complex business-to-business transactions. Rackham’s multi-year research project turned this thinking on its ear and showed that, on the contrary, conventional methods developed for small consumer sales, such as widely used techniques for closing the deal, failed miserably when applied in more complex transactions. He found that greater success could be achieved in larger-scale transactions by focusing on a pattern of questions (situation, problem, implication, and need-payoff) that became widely known as SPIN.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/SPIN-Selling-Neil-Rackham/dp/0070511136&lt;/ref&gt;

Rackham’s premise in SPIN®Selling was that the most successful sellers are seen by their customers as consultants or problem solvers who are working in the customers’ best interest.

In its list of the “Top 10 ‘How To Sell’ Books of All Time,” in 2013 Inc. magazine ranked SPIN®Selling No. 1, writing:

″Finally, this is the book that turned selling from an art into a science. While other sales books are heavy with anecdotes and assumptions, Neil Rackham examined hard evidence of actual sales performance and codified what works — and what doesn’t — in real world sales situations. A must-read for everyone who sells″&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/top-10-sales-books-of-all-time.html&lt;/ref&gt;

SPIN Selling remains one of McGraw-Hill’s all-time top-selling business books. It is currently Amazon’s best-selling book on sales.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/684250011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_4_last&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other publications===

Among Rackham’s other books on sales and marketing are The Management of Major Sales (McGraw-Hill, 1991) with Richard Ruff; Getting Partnering Right (McGraw-Hill, 1996), with Lawrence Friedman and Richard Ruff, and the New York Times business bestseller Rethinking the Sales Force (McGraw-Hill, 2000), co-authored with John DeVincentis.&lt;ref&gt;http://neilrackham.com/books/&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to books, Rackham has written more than 150 articles on marketing, selling and channel strategy including “Ending the War Between Sales and Marketing,” co-authored with Philip Kotler and Suj Krishnaswamy for Harvard Business Review (2006),&lt;ref&gt;https://hbr.org/2006/07/ending-the-war-between-sales-and-marketing&lt;/ref&gt;“Breadth of a Salesman,” with John DeVincentis, for McKinsey Quarterly (1998),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-54793407/breadth-of-a-salesman&lt;/ref&gt; and “Why Bad Things Happen to Good New Products” for the Journal of Product Innovation Management (1998).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allianceperformance.com/White%20Papers/Why_Bad_Things_Happen_to_Good_New_Products.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consulting and teaching===

Rackham led Huthwaite Inc. until 2003 and later became a strategic advisor to the firm he founded.

He has been a visiting professor of sales and marketing at Portsmouth University since 2006; a visiting professor of sales strategy at the Cranfield School of Management since 2008; an executive professor of professional selling at the Carl H. Lindner College of Business at the University of Cincinnati since 2011; and visiting professor of sales at Sheffield University since 2014.

He has also been a guest or visiting lecturer at numerous U.S. business schools including Harvard Business School, Wharton, Kellogg School of Management, Darden School of Business, Kelley School of Business, Ohio University, and Purdue University.

'''Panopticon Software''' (now known as Datawatch Panopticon Streaming Analytics) was a multi-national [[data visualization]] software company specializing in monitoring and analysis of [[real-time data]]. The firm was headquartered in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], with additional offices in [[New York City]], [[London]], [[Boston]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Chicago]]. It partnered with several large systems integrators and infrastructure software companies, including [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Thomson Reuters]], Kx Systems, and One Market Data (OneTick). The company's name is derived from the Greek: 'pan' for all, 'optic' for sight. The company name is derived from the word [[panopticon]] which is an architectural concept originally intended to facilitate surveillance of prisons.

In August 2013, Panopticon was acquired by [[Datawatch Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;

Panopticon Software was a key player in the data visualization sector along with for example [[Qliktech]], [[Tableau Software]] and [[Tibco Software]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its Swedish origins are shared with GapMinder, Qliktech and Spotfire, making Sweden a centre for [[Information visualization|Information Visualization]] research and development.

It historically specialised in selling [[Treemapping]] and [[Heatmap]] visualisation software and development tools to clients within the [[financial services]] and [[telecommunications]] industries. It uses a variety of other visual analysis tools in its products, including [[Scatter plot|Scatter Plots]], [[Dot plot (statistics)|Dot Plots]], [[Pie chart|Pie Charts]], [[Line graph|Line Graphs]], and [[Bullet graph|Bullet Graph]] visualizations. The company's products are sometimes deployed as [[Executive dashboard|Executive Dashboards]] that allow managers to interact, explore, monitor and analyze rapidly changing and/or large data sets. Panopticon tools are also often embedded in other enterprise applications using the company's [[software development kit]], which is available for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Microsoft]] [[.NET Framework|.NET]] and the [[Windows Presentation Foundation]]. The Panopticon products are optimized for use with [[real-time data]] [[Message queue|message buses]], [[complex event processing]] engines, [[relational databases]], and [[Column-oriented DBMS|column-oriented databases]]&lt;ref&gt;

==Pre-attentive processing==
Pre-Attentive Processing is a term from the area of human cognitive psychology and refers to the ability of the low-level human visual system to rapidly identify certain basic visual properties. Examples of visual features that can be detected in this way include hue, intensity, enclosure, orientation, size, and motion.&lt;ref&gt;

==Technology overview==
Panopticon's technology relies on in-memory [[OLAP cube]]s, which are displayed through a series of visualizations including treemaps. This allows the user to load data, select variables and hierarchical structures, and navigate through the resultant visualization, filtering, zooming and drilling (sometimes called slicing and dicing), to identify outliers, correlations and trends.

Its streaming [[OLAP]] implementation takes an in-memory [[OLAP]] cube and allows data to be streamed through it. This combination makes the company's products attractive to industry verticals that require live streaming data, such as financial [[market data]] [[Electric power transmission|utility grid]] monitoring and [[telecommunications]] [[Network traffic measurement|network traffic analysis]]. This is very different than the vast majority of OLAP implementations in which cubes are rebuilt periodically for new batches of data.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Platon Leonidovich Lebedev''' (Russian: Плато́н Леони́дович Ле́бедев; born 29 November 1956) is a Russian [[businessman]] and former [[CEO]] of [[Group Menatep]]. He was convicted of tax evasion, money laundering and embezzlement by Russian courts in two cases and imprisoned from July 2003 to January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Khordorkovsky associate Platon Lebedev to be released | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25858870 | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=23 January 2014 | accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known as a close associate of [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/russian-court-denies-lebedev-his-freedom-560172.html|title= Russian court denies Lebedev his freedom|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=16 February 2010 | location=London | date=16 April 2004 | first=Our | last=City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life ==
Platon Lebedev graduated from the [[Plekhanov Russian University of Economics|Academy of National Economy Plekhanov]] in Moscow in 1981. After graduating he worked in the Foreign Trade Department "Zarubezhgeologia" (Russian: Зарубежгеология) of the Soviet Ministry of Geology until 1989. There he met [[Leonid Nevzlin]] who subsequently introduced him to [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]]. Between 1989 and 1992, Lebedev headed the currency and finance department of Khodorkovsky's [[Bank Menatep]] and became president and a member of the board in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/the-man-behind-menateps-machine/237379.html ''The Man Behind Menatep's Machine''], by Alla Startseva, themoscowtimes.com, Jul. 04 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He served as president until 1995. Since 1996 he sat on the board of oil company [[Yukos]]. Lebedev served as CEO of [[Bank Menatep#Group Menatep Limited|Group Menatep Ltd.]] (principal shareholder of [[YUKOS]]) from 2002 until his arrest in July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=39744482&amp;privcapId=1307783 "''Platon Lebedev''"], bloomberg.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/the-man-behind-menateps-machine/237379.html "''The Man Behind Menatep's Machine''"], themoscowtimes.com, Jul. 04 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, Platon Lebedev holds a stake of about 7 percent in Group Menatep Limited, now GML Limited. Holding company GML Limited controls 51% of Yukos shares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/p538197/r_1/The_Best_Defence_Is_Non-Ownership/ The Best Defence Is Non-Ownership], kommersant.com, Jan. 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The other four ultimate beneficial owners of GML Limited are [[Leonid Nevzlin]], Mikhail Brudno, Vladimir Dubov and Vasily Shakhnovsky.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/23/russia-yukos-idUSL6N0PY3KW20140723 Ruling in Yukos shareholders' $100-bln suit against Russia expected Monday], reuters.com, Jul 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conviction and imprisonment ==
On 2 July 2003, Platon Lebedev, then chairman of the board of Menatep, was summoned as a witness to the Prosecutor General’s Office in an investigation into embezzlement of state funds. Shortly before the scheduled visit, Lebedev however felt ill at about 5 a.m. and was taken to a hospital. Lebedev then subsequently was arrested in the hospital on suspicion of stealing a 20% stake in JSC [[Apatit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasandoil.com/news/russia/4e7da30e813b56d47b6fe5de9464a821  Yukos arrests are part of new campaign on big business], gasandoil.com, Jul 09, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2005, Lebedev was convicted of [[tax evasion]] in 2005, and sentenced to nine years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4482203.stm|title=Khodorkovsky: an oligarch undone |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 February 2010 | date=31 May 2005 | first=Jeremy | last=Scott-Joynt}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently charged with [[embezzlement]] and [[money laundering]] in 2009, and pleaded not guilty to the charges.&lt;ref name="bbc09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8009817.stm|title=Ex-Yukos chief pleads not guilty |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 February 2010 | date=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8465300|title=Khodorkovsky pleads not guilty to embezzlement|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=16 February 2010 | location=London | date=23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been speculation that these charges were politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/03/international/europe/03CND-RUSS.html?ex=1057896000&amp;en=c31af43ea395412e&amp;ei=5062&amp;partner=GOOGLE|title=Oil Executive Is Arrested, and Russians Look for Putin's Role|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=16 February 2010 | first=Sabrina | last=Tavernise | date=3 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 December 2010, Lebedev and [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] were each sentenced to 13 years in prison for money laundering and embezzlement. In the second case against them, they were found guilty of organizing a criminal group in the oil business, embezzling 218 million tonnes of oil from Yukos’ oil extraction subsidiary companies, Uganskneftegaz, Tomskneft and Samaraneftegaz. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/lebedev-yukos-term-down-757/ Khodorkovsky partner given early release], rt.com, November 01, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013 Khodorkovsky was released while Lebedev was released on 24 January 2014. "A short prison sentence might be considered a victory for Mr. Putin’s protégé, President Dmitri A. Medvedev, a former law professor who is thought of as less of a hard-liner. Mr. Medvedev has been promoting policies to modernize Russia, and analysts say the Khodorkovsky case is an obstacle toward convincing foreign investors that the country’s legal system is fair."&lt;ref&gt;CLIFFORD J. LEVY and ANDREW E. KRAMER, 'Imprisoned Russian Oil Tycoon Is Convicted Again', ''[[New York Times]]'', DECEMBER 27, 2010 [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/world/europe/28russia.html?_r=1&amp;hp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Parfitt, 'WikiLeaks: rule of law in Mikhail Khodorkovsky trial merely gloss', ''[[Guardian.co.uk]]'', DECEMBER 27, 2010 [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/27/wikileaks-russia-mikhail-khodorkovsky-trial]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 2011, Lebedev and Khodorkovsky were named [[prisoners of conscience]] by [[Amnesty International]], which criticized the men's second trial and called for their release on the expiry of their initial sentences.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/russian-businessmen-declared-prisoners-conscience-after-convictions-are-upheld-2011 |title=Russian businessmen declared prisoners of conscience after convictions are upheld|date=24 May 2011 |work= |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 August 2012, Lebedev's 13-year sentence was reduced by 3 years and 4 months by a district court judge in the Arkhangelsk region city of Velsk, where Lebedev had been imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/russia-reduces-prison-term-for-lebedev-interfax-says-correct-.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=8 August 2012|title=Russian Court Orders Release Of Khodorkovsky Partner In 2013|first=Henry|last=Meyer|date=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action came as a result of the prosecutor's office requesting a re-qualification of Lebedev's offenses due to the passage of a new legal statute in the Russian Criminal Code which reduced the punishment for offenses of which he had been convicted.

On 25 October 2013, the [[Berlin International Literature Festival]] held a worldwide reading in solidarity with Platon Lebedev and all criminals who allege they are political prisoners in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwide-reading.com/archiv-en/25-10-2013-worldwide-reading-in-solidarity-with-mikhail-khodorkovsky-platon-lebedev-and-all-political-prisoners-in-russia|title=25.10.2013 - Worldwide Reading in Solidarity with Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Platon Lebedev and all Political Prisoners in Russia|work=Worldwide Reading|access-date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
On 23 January 2014, the [[Russian Supreme Court]] reduced Lebedev's sentence and ordered his release from prison. But Supreme Court Judge Pyotr Serkov did not change a court order under which Lebedev and Khodorkovsky had to pay 17bn roubles ($500m; £300m) in tax arrears.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25888975 Russia frees Khodorkovsky ex-partner Lebedev], bbc.co.uk, 24 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after his release, Lebedev said in an interview with [[Ren TV]] that he intended to resume business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.ru/russia/353910 Платон Лебедев думает вернуться в бизнес, не помышляет о политике в чистом виде и обещает всех удивить], interfax.ru, January 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Platon Lebedev announced his first press conference after his release from prison in Moscow on 18 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khodorkovsky.com/platon-lebedev-give-first-press-conference/ Platon Lebedev to Give First Press Conference], khodorkovsky.com, 18 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:QlickTech logo.svg|thumb|Historic logo]]
The company Qlik was previously known as QlikTech. The latter was founded in [[Lund, Sweden]] in 1993 as a software company in [[business intelligence]] (BI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qlik.com/en/company Qlik.com]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2017}} Its PC-based desktop tool was called QuikView. "Quik" stood for "Quality, Understanding, Interaction, Knowledge." Initially the software was sold only in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000606175&amp;fid=1725 JVP makes 4,000% return on QlikTech] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203060453/http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000606175&amp;fid=1725 |date=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company focused on the area of  Business Intelligence (BI),  growing from 35 employees in 1999 to 70 in 2003. A syndicate of existing investors together with venture capital firms [[Accel Partners]] and [[Jerusalem Venture Partners]] (JVP) raised $12.5 million in capital&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20041206005593/en/QlikTech-Secures-12.5-Million-Venture-Capital-Funding QlikTech Secures 12.5 Million Venture Capital Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2017}} 

Alex Ott of Accel and [[Erel Margalit]] of JVP devised a growth strategy that resulted in  a 35% annual growth rate and $13 million in revenue by 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jvpvc.com/news/jvp-sells-30-of-its-holding-in-qlik-technologies-for-112-million JVP sells holding in QLIK Technologies for $112 million] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230041411/http://www.jvpvc.com/news/jvp-sells-30-of-its-holding-in-qlik-technologies-for-112-million |date=December 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2017}}

'''Rosenbaum Brothers Department Store''' (1849–1971) in its prime was one of the largest department stores between [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] and [[Baltimore, Maryland]].  Founded in 1848 in the City of [[Cumberland, Maryland]] along Baltimore Street, the Rosenbaum Department store once employed over 200 people.  Their building was a {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, five story building with bay windows. Trimmed stone, anthropomorphic sculptures on the keystones, and lions heads along the roofline comprise a few of the decorative architectal details. The building was constructed in 1897-1898 and opened in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Albert L. Feldstein, "Allegany County, MD", Arcadia Publishing, 2006, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, The Rosenbaum building is the home of the [[M&amp;T Bank]].

'''Ruth Baird Bryan Leavitt Owen Rohde''', also known as '''Ruth Bryan Owen''', (October 2, 1885 – July 26, 1954) was a politician and the first woman appointed as a United States ambassador. The daughter of attorney [[William Jennings Bryan]] and Mary E. Baird, she was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], who in 1929 was elected as [[Florida]]'s (and the [[Southern United States|South]]'s) first woman US Representative, coming from Florida's 4th district.  Representative Owen was also the first woman to earn a seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/highlights.html?action=view&amp;intID=273|title=Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives - 404|author=Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives|work=house.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, she became the first woman to be appointed as a U.S. ambassador, when President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] selected her as Ambassador to [[Denmark]] and [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, Sarah Pauline.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Ruth Bryan was born on October 2, 1885 in [[Jacksonville, Illinois]] to William Jennings Bryan and his wife Mary E. Baird. Ruth's father was an attorney and three-time presidential candidate. Growing up Ruth had to move several times depending on her father's work in politics. Ruth attended public schools in Washington, D.C and the Monticello Female Academy in [[Godfrey, Illinois]]. In 1901 she began to take classes at the [[University of Nebraska]].

In 1903 Bryan dropped out of the [[University of Nebraska]] to marry [[William H. Leavitt]], a well-known [[Newport, Rhode Island]] portrait painter. The couple met when he was painting Bryan's father's portrait.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/09/23/102023416.pdf "The Leavitt-Bryan Wedding," ''The New York Times,'' Sept. 23, 1903]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children before divorcing in 1909.

Bryan married Reginald Owen, a British Army officer, in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/04/105078012.pdf The Owen-Bryan Wedding, The New York Times, May 4, 1910]&lt;/ref&gt; and had two more children with him. Her second husband died in 1928. She spent three years in [[Oracabessa, Jamaica]], where she oversaw the design and construction of her home, [[Golden Clouds]]. It is now operated as a luxury [[villa]]. Owen kept her home in Jamaica for more than three decades and spent many winters there, particularly in later years when she lived in [[Denmark]] and [[New York City]].  She detailed her time in Jamaica and experiences at Golden Clouds in her book, ''Caribbean Caravel.''&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Brown Owen, ''Caribbean Caravel,'' New York: Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, Bryan served as a war nurse in the Voluntary Aid Detachment in the Egypt–Palestine campaign, 1915–1918. She also served as a secretary for the [[American Women's War Relief Fund]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://americanwomeninwwi.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/helping-in-britain-the-american-womens-war-relief-fund/|title=Helping in Britain: The American Women's War Relief Fund.|last=|first=|date=2017-01-09|work=American Women in World War I|access-date=2018-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927022703/https://americanwomeninwwi.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/helping-in-britain-the-american-womens-war-relief-fund/|archive-date=27 September 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-U8DwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=%22american%20women's%20war%20relief%20fund%22&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q=%22american%20women's%20war%20relief%20fund%22&amp;f=false|title=Ruth Bryan Owen: Congresswoman and Diplomat|last=Brown|first=Rudd|last2=Myers|first2=Paul A.|publisher=Paul Andrew Myers|year=2014|isbn=9781497442023|location=|pages=40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filmmaking career===

Ruth Bryan Owen was a female pioneer in the film industry. She was a director, producer, and screenwriter for a feature film in 1922, called ''Once Upon a Time/Scheherazade,'' which is now considered to be lost.&lt;ref name="bryanowen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-ruth-bryan-owen/|title=Ruth Bryan Owen|work=columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1921, she started production of ''Once Upon a Time.''&lt;ref name=bryanowen /&gt; The film featured the Community Players of [[Coconut Grove, Florida]], and was not related to a major studio at the time.&lt;ref name="Silent Feminists"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slide|first1=Anthony|title=The Silent Feminists: America's First Women Directors|date=January 1, 1996|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=0-8108-3053-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF44Hy1HVj4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story line was said to revolve around a shah who is dethroned by his jealous subordinate, who in turn uses his new power to torture young women who do not amuse him. Towards the end, the sadistic ruler runs into the most beautiful one of all, and the exiled shah returns just in time to save the young woman from his nemesis. According to the [[Moving Picture World]], the costuming was ornate and elaborately done, the staging was complicated, and the [[mise-en-scène]] evoked an "atmosphere of experience in the Far East".&lt;ref name=bryanowen /&gt; Owen had done extensive traveling, and visited countries such as [[India]], [[Burma]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. Inspired by these places, she used them as the backdrop for her film.

Little would be known about the film except that Owen discussed it in correspondence with her friend, Carrie Dunlap. Dunlap was from Illinois and served as campaign treasurer for Ruth's father William Jennings Bryan.&lt;ref name="Owen's Father"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKenzie|first1=Howard Glenn|title=William Jennings Bryan in Miami|journal=diss. University of Miami|date=1956|volume=Unpublished}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her letters to Dunlap, Owen expresses great joy in her film, quoting, "I can scarcely believe the film is mine when I see it 'projected' on the wall above our fireplace."&lt;ref name="Carrie Dunlap Papers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=Ruth Bryan|last2=Dunlap|first2=Carrie|title=Carrie Dunlap Papers|date=1907–1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She thought of herself as a true pioneer in the industry. Her correspondence with Dunlap also revealed her intent to become one of the first female filmmakers in the U.S. Owen funded the film solely from her earnings in the public speaker circuit. In her letters, Owen discussed the support she gained from the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]], and their contribution to help secure a distribution deal with the Society for Visual Education.&lt;ref name=bryanowen /&gt;

===Political career===
[[File:Ruth Bryan Owen taking the oath.gif|200px|thumb|Ruth Bryan Owen, Ambassador to Denmark, America's first woman envoy, taking the oath of office. P.F. Allen, Chief Clerk of the appointment division of the Department of State is administering the oath]]
Owen first ran for office in 1926 for the Democratic nomination for Florida's 4th congressional district. It was a year after the death of her father. It then included nearly the entire east coast of the state from [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to the [[Florida Keys]]: with [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. She lost by fewer than 800 votes.&lt;ref&gt;Morin, Isobel V., ''Women Chosen for Public Office,'' The Oliver Press, (1995), p78&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1925 to 1928, she was an administrator at the [[University of Miami]].

Two years later, after the death of her husband, she ran again. Since Owen played a significant role when hurricane hit Miami in 1927 and put effort on promotions on newspapers, she won over Sears by more than 14,000 votes [http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/19256] and was elected to Congress in November 1928 and began her term of office on March 4, 1929, while a widow and mother of four. Her election was contested on the grounds that she had lost her citizenship by marrying an alien. By the [[Cable Act]] in 1922, she could petition for her citizenship, which she did in 1925, less than the seven years required by the Constitution. She argued her case before the House Committee on Elections, saying that no American man had ever lost his citizenship by marriage. She said that she lost her citizenship because she was a woman, not because of her marital status. The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] voted in her favor.&lt;ref&gt;U. S. Congress. House. ''Arguments and Hearings before Elections Committee No. 1; Contested Election Case of William C. Lawson v. Ruth Bryan Owen, from the Fourth Congressional District of Florida. 71st Cong., 2nd sess., 1930.'' Washington: Government Printing Office, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U. S. Congress. House. ''Report No. 968. Committee on Elections No. 1. William C. Lawson-Ruth Bryan Owen Election Case. Report of the Hon. Carroll L. Beedy, of Maine, chairman. 71st Cong., 2nd sess., 1930.'' Washington: Government Printing Office, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen ran for re-election in 1930, defeating [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] attorney [[Dewitt T. Deen]] by a wide margin in the June Democratic primary election.&lt;ref name=Swamps&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5990309/ruth_bryan_owen_swamps_wet_in_primaries/ "Mrs. Owen Swamps Wet in Primaries,"] ''Oakland Tribune,'' June 4, 1930, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Republican Party was running its first primary campaign in Florida history in 1930 and did not nominate a candidate to run against the Democratic nominee, the pro-[[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|prohibition]] Owen was heralded in the press as presumably having won re-election by virtue of her Democratic nomination.&lt;ref name=Swamps /&gt;

Owen's two-year term won in 1930 would prove to be her last, however, as in the 1932 Democratic primary she was defeated by Democratic candidate [[J. Mark Wilcox]], who advocated the repeal of Prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Weidling. p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Her Congressional career thus came to an end in March 1933.

===First U.S. female ambassador===

From 1933 to 1936 Bryan Owen served as [[United States Ambassador to Denmark]], appointed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/po/com/10497.htm|title=Office of the Historian|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=O000154|title=OWEN, Ruth Bryan - Biographical Information|work=congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served successfully until 1936, when she married Borge Rohde, a Danish Captain of the King's Guard, on July 11. The marriage gave her dual citizenship as a Dane—in addition to that of the United States—so she resigned her ambassadorial post in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,936314,00.html|title=Milestones, Aug. 9, 1954|date=9 August 1954|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/19256|work=history.house.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Bryan Owen married Captain Borge Rohde at the estate of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] in Hyde Park, New York.  [[Fannie Hurst]], noted novelist and close friend of the bride, was matron of honor. Mrs. Owen announced that she would retain her own name in her diplomacy and literary careers.

She served as a delegate to the [[San Francisco Conference]], which established the [[United Nations]] after World War II. In 1948, President Truman named her an alternate delegate to the [[U.N. General Assembly]].

===Later years, death and legacy===

In 1939, Ruth Bryan Owen and her husband purchased "[[Alexander McVeigh Miller House|The Cedars]]", located at [[Alderson, West Virginia]], and began making repairs.  They sold the property in 1945.&lt;ref name="dhr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/fayette/78002794.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Alexander McVeigh Miller House|date=July 1978|accessdate=2011-07-31|author=C.E. Turley|publisher=State of West Virginia, West Virginia Division of Culture and History, Historic Preservation}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen died July 26, 1954 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, and was cremated. Her ashes were interred at Ordrup Cemetery, Copenhagen.

In 1992, Owen was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame.

'''Sales''' are activities related to selling or the number of goods or services sold in a given time period.

The ''seller'' or the provider of the [[Goods and services|goods or services]] complete a sale in response to an [[takeover|acquisition]], [[appropriation (economics)|appropriation]],&lt;ref&gt;Part III, effects of the contract, Rule 5. ''Sale of Goods Act 1979''. [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[purchase order|requisition]] or a direct interaction with the ''buyer'' at the [[point of sale]]. There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the [[Commodity|item]], and the settlement of a [[price]], in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur. The ''seller'', not the [[Purchasing|purchaser]] generally executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of [[payment]]. In the case of indirect interaction, a person who sells goods or service on behalf of the owner is known as a '''salesman''' or '''saleswoman''' or '''salesperson''', but this often refers to someone selling goods in a store/shop, in which case other terms are also common, including ''[[salesclerk]]'', ''shop assistant'', and ''retail clerk''.

In common law countries, sales are governed generally by the [[common law]] and [[commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s. In the [[United States]], the laws governing sales of goods are somewhat uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adopted]] Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], albeit with some non-uniform variations.

==Definition==
A person or organization expressing an interest in acquiring the offered item of value is referred to as a potential buyer, prospective customer or prospect.  Buying and selling are understood to be two sides of the same "coin" or transaction. Both seller and buyer engage in a process of negotiation to consummate the exchange of values. The exchange, or selling, process has implied rules and identifiable stages. It is implied that the selling process will proceed fairly and ethically so that the parties end up nearly equally rewarded. The stages of selling, and buying, involve getting acquainted, assessing each party's need for the other's item of value, and determining if the values to be exchanged are equivalent or nearly so, or, in buyer's terms, "worth the price". Sometimes, sellers have to use their own experiences when selling products with appropriate discounts.&lt;ref name=seller&gt;{{cite journal |title=Buyer Success and Failure in Bargaining and Its Consequences |first=C. |last=Putthiwanit |first2=S.-H. |last2=Ho |journal=Australian Journal of Business and Management Research  |volume=1 |issue=5 |year=2011 |pages=83–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a management viewpoint it is thought of as a part of [[marketing]],&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kotler, ''Principles of Marketing,'' Prentice -Hall, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; although the skills required are different. Sales often form a separate grouping in a corporate structure, employing separate specialist operatives known as ''salespersons'' (singular: ''salesperson''). Selling is considered by many to be a sort of [[persuasion|persuad]]ing "art". Contrary to popular belief, the methodological approach of selling refers to a ''systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, by which a salesman relates his or her offering of a product or service in return enabling the buyer to achieve their goal in an economic way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Greening |first=Jack |title=Selling Without Confrontation |publisher= The Haworth Press, Inc. |year=1993 |pages=23 |isbn=1-56024-326-0 }} Page image [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1560243260&amp;id=O8y4P3tGcEIC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;ots=FBSfQrSxig&amp;dq=methodical+sales+approach&amp;sig=gYaUSDYLWTuMBe_KFzfFOoEYdEY]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2018 survey of salespeople, selling has become more difficult in recent years due to changes in technology and general access to prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marcwayshak.com/sales-statistics/|title=18 Sales Statistics You Need to Know About Right Now! [INFOGRAPHIC]|work=Sales Speaker Marc Wayshak|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[sales process]] refers to a systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, the definition of the selling is somewhat ambiguous due to the close nature of [[advertising]], [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[public relations]], and [[direct marketing]].

Selling is the profession-wide term, much like [[marketing]] defines a profession. Recently, attempts have been made to clearly understand who is in the sales profession, and who is not. There are many articles looking at [[marketing]], [[advertising]], [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]]s, and even [[public relations]] as ways to create a unique [[Financial transaction|transaction]].

Two common terms used to describe a salesperson are "Farmer" and "Hunter". The reality is that most professional salespeople have a little of both. A hunter is often associated with aggressive personalities who use aggressive sales technique. In terms of sales methodology, a hunter refers to a person whose focus is on bringing in and closing deals. This process is called "sales capturing". An example is a commodity sale such as a long distance salesperson, shoe salesperson and to a degree a car salesperson. Their job is to find and convert buyers. A sales farmer is someone who creates sales demand through activities that directly influence and alter the buying process.

Many believe that the focus of selling is on the human agents involved in the exchange between buyer and seller. Effective selling also requires a [[Systems thinking|systems approach]], at minimum involving roles that sell, enable selling, and develop sales capabilities.  Selling also involves [[salesperson|salespeople]] who possess a specific set of [[selling method|sales skills]] and the knowledge required to facilitate the exchange of value between buyers and sellers that is unique from marketing, advertising, etc.

Within these three tenets, the following definition of professional selling is offered by the [[American Society for Training and Development]] (ASTD):
{{cquote|The holistic business system required to effectively develop, manage, enable, and execute a mutually beneficial, interpersonal exchange of goods or services for equitable value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) | work=Sales Competency Project | url=http://www.astd.org/sdp | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921095003/http://www.astd.org/sdp | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2008-09-21 | date= | accessdate=2017-03-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Team selling]] is one way to influence sales. Team selling is "a group of people representing the sales department and other functional areas in the firm, such as finance, production, and research and development". (Spiro) Team selling came about in the 1990s through [[total quality management]] (TQM). TQM occurs when companies work to improve their customer satisfaction by constantly improving all of their operations.

=== Relationships with marketing ===
{{Marketing}}
[[Marketing]] and sales differ greatly but generally have the same goal. Selling is the final stage in marketing which puts the plan into effect, which also includes pricing, promotion, place, and product (the 4 P's). A marketing department in an organization has the goals of increasing the desirability and value to the customer and increasing the number and engagement of interactions between potential customers and the organization. Achieving this goal may involve the sales team using promotional techniques such as [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], [[publicity]], and [[public relations]], creating new [[sales channels]], or creating new products ([[new product development]]), among other things. It can also include bringing the potential customer to visit the organization's website(s) for more information, or to contact the organization for more information, or to interact with the organization via social media such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[blog]]s. Social values also play a major role in consumer decision processes. Marketing is the whole of the work on persuasion made for the whole of the target people. Sales are the persuasion and effort that from one person to one person (B2C), one person makes to the corporation (B2B) in the face or in the phone or in the digital environment, to make a living resource enter the company.

The field of [[sales process engineering]] views "sales" as the output of a larger system, not just as the output of one department. The larger system includes many functional areas within an organization. From this perspective, "sales" and "marketing" (among others, such as "[[customer service]]") label for a number of processes whose inputs and outputs supply one another to varying degrees. In this context, improving an "output" (such as sales) involves studying and improving the broader sales process, as in any system, since the component functional areas interact and are interdependent.&lt;ref name="Selden"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Paul H. Selden|date=December 1998|title=Sales Process Engineering: An Emerging Quality Application|journal=Quality Progress| pages = 59–63}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many large corporations structure their marketing departments so they are directly integrated with all lines of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How To Organize Your Marketing Department In The Digital Age|url = http://www.cmo.com/articles/2015/2/12/organizing-for-digital-cwtk.html|website = www.cmo.com|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They create multiple teams with a singular focus and the managers of these teams must coordinate efforts in order to drive profits and business success. For example, an "inbound" focused campaign seeks to drive more customers "through the door", giving the sales department a better chance of selling their product to the consumer. A good marketing program would address any potential downsides as well.

The sales department would aim to improve the interaction between the customer and the sales facility or mechanism (example, website) or salesperson. As Sales is the forefront of any organization, this would always need to take place before any other business process may begin. Sales management would break down the selling process and then increase the effectiveness of the discrete processes as well as the interaction between processes. For example, in many out-bound sales environments, the typical process includes outbound calling, the sales pitch, handling objections, opportunity identification, and the close. Each step of the process has sales-related issues, skills, and training needs, as well as marketing solutions to improve each discrete step, as well as the whole process. In many cases becoming a salesperson is a default career as not many people aspire to be a salesman but rather fall into the job due to circumstances. It can be highly rewarding as you receive remuneration in the form of a salary and also commission.

One further common complication of marketing involves the inability to measure results for a lot of marketing initiatives. In essence, many marketing and advertising executives often lose sight of the objective of sales/revenue/profit, as they focus on establishing a creative/innovative program, without concern for the [[top line|top]] or [[bottom line]]s – a fundamental pitfall of marketing for marketing's sake.

Many companies find it challenging to get marketing and sales on the same page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ending The War Between Sales And Marketing|url=http://hbr.org/web/special-collections/insight/marketing-that-works/end-the-war-between-sales-and-marketing|website=hbr.org|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=16 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125522/http://hbr.org/web/special-collections/insight/marketing-that-works/end-the-war-between-sales-and-marketing|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two departments, although different in nature, handle very similar concepts and have to work together for sales to be successful. Building a good relationship between the two that encourages communication can be the key to success – even in a [[down economy]].

===Industrial marketing===
The idea that marketing can potentially eliminate the need for salespeople depends entirely on context.  For example, this may be possible in some [[business-to-consumer|B2C]] situations; however, for many [[business-to-business|B2B]] transactions (for example, those involving industrial organizations) this is mostly impossible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Another dimension is the value of the goods being sold. [[Fast moving consumer goods|Fast-moving consumer-goods]] (FMCG) require no sales people at the [[point of sale]] to get them to jump off the supermarket shelf and into the customer's trolley. However, the purchase of large mining equipment worth millions of dollars will require a salesperson to manage the sales process – particularly in the face of competitors. [[Small and medium businesses]] selling such large ticket items to a geographically-disperse client base use [[manufacturers' representative]]s to provide this highly personal service while avoiding the large expense of a captive sales force.

===Sales and marketing alignment and integration===
Another area of discussion involves the need for alignment and integration of corporate sales and marketing functions. According to a report from the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Council, only 40 percent of companies have formal programs, systems or processes in place to align and integrate the two critical functions.

Traditionally, these two functions, as referenced above, have operated separately, left in siloed areas of tactical responsibility. Glen Petersen's book ''The [[Profit maximization|Profit Maximization]] Paradox''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

|page= 176
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; sees the changes in the competitive landscape between the 1950s and the time of writing as so dramatic that the complexity of choice, price, and opportunities for the customer forced this seemingly simple and integrated relationship between sales and marketing to change forever. Petersen goes on to highlight that salespeople spend approximately 40 percent of their time preparing customer-facing deliverables while leveraging less than 50 percent of the materials created by marketing, adding to perceptions that marketing is out of touch with the customer and that sales is resistant to [[messaging]] and [[Marketing strategy|strategy]].

Often the complexity involves one business working closely with the other to define problems, to finding solutions, to supporting after-sale operation. Because of this complexity, there is a need to manage the relationships between the buying and selling organisations, for example using Peter Cheverton's relationship models&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Key Account Management 4th Edition|last = Peter|first = Cheverton|publisher = Kogan Page|year = 2008|isbn = 978 0 7494 5277 3|location = |pages = 90–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stakeholder map by Anderson, Bryson and Crosby&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://cep.lse.ac.uk/seminarpapers/10-02-03-BRY.pdf|title = What To Do When Stakeholders Matter: A Guide to Stakeholder Identification and Analysis Techniques|last = John|first = Bryson|date = 10 Feb 2003|journal = London School of Economics and Political Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sales agents ===
Agents in the sales process can represent either of two parties in the sales process; for example:

# Sales broker, seller agency, seller agent, [[Manufacturers' representative|seller representative]]: This is a traditional role where the salesman represents a person or company on the selling end of a deal.
# Buyers broker or Buyer brokerage: This is where the salesman represents the consumer making the purchase. This is most often applied in large transactions.
# Disclosed dual agent: This is where the salesman represents both parties in the sale and acts as a [[Mediation|mediator]] for the transaction. The role of the salesman here is to oversee that both parties receive an honest and fair deal, and is responsible to both.
# Transaction broker: This is where the salesperson represents neither party but handles the transaction only. The seller owes no responsibility to either party getting a fair or honest deal, just that all of the papers are handled properly.
# Sales outsourcing involves direct branded representation where the sales representatives are recruited, hired, and managed by an external entity but hold quotas, represent themselves as the brand of the client, and report all activities (through their own [[sales management]] channels) back to the client. It is akin to a virtual extension of a sales force (see [[sales outsourcing]]).
# Sales managers aim to implement various sales strategies and management techniques in order to facilitate improved [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] and increased sales volume. They are also responsible for coordinating the sales and marketing department as well as oversight concerning the [[Justice|fair]] and [[honesty|honest]] execution of the sales process by their agents.
# Salesperson: The primary function of professional salespeople is to generate and close business resulting in revenue. The salesperson will accomplish their primary function through a variety of means including phone calls, email, social media, networking, and [[cold calling]].  The primary objective of the successful salesperson is to find the consumers to sell to.  Sales are often referred to as a "numbers game" because a general law of averages and pattern of successful closing of business will emerge through heightened sales activity. These activities include but are not limited to: locating prospects, fostering relationships with prospects, building trust with future clients, identifying and filling needs of consumers, and therefore turning prospective customers into actual ones. Many tools are used by successful salespeople, the most important of which is questioning which can be defined as a series of questions and resulting answers allowing the salesperson to understand a customer's goals and requirements relevant to the product.  The creation of value or [[perceived value]] is the result of taking the information gathered, analyzing the goals and needs of the prospective customer and leveraging the products or services the salesperson's firm represents or sells in a way that most effectively achieves the prospective client's goals or suits their needs.  Effective salespeople will package their offering and present their proposed solution in a way that leads the prospective customer to the conclusion that they acquire the solution, resulting in revenue and profit for the salesperson and the organization they represent.
# Internet Sales Professionals: These people are primarily responsible for ensuring immediate response to the leads generated via social media, website or email campaigns.

==={{anchord|Inside sales}} vs. {{anchord|outside sales}}===
In the United States, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] defines outside sales representatives as "employees [who] sell their employer's products, services, or facilities to customers away from their employer's place(s) of business, in general, either at the customer's place of business or by selling door-to-door at the customer's home" while defining those who work "from the employer's location" as inside sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/overtime/s1.htm |title=elaws - FLSA Overtime Security Advisor |publisher=[[United States Department of Labor]] |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25 |archivedate=2011-05-25 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ywTnhanX?url=http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/overtime/s1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside sales generally involves attempting to [[closing (sales)|close business]] primarily over the phone via [[telemarketing]], while outside sales (or "field" sales) will usually involve initial phone work to book sales calls at the potential buyer's location to attempt to close the deal in person. Some companies have an inside sales department that works with outside representatives and book their appointments for them. Inside sales sometimes refers to [[upselling]] to existing customers.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

[[File:Sir George Burns.jpg|thumb|right|An etching of Sir George Burns]]
'''Sir George Burns, 1st Baronet''' (10 December 1795 – 2 June 1890) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[shipping]] [[business magnate|magnate]].

Burns was born in [[Glasgow]], the son of [[John Burns (minister)|Rev John Burns]] (1744–1839),  a [[Presbyterian]] [[minister of religion|minister]]. George was the younger brother of [[James Burns (1789-1871)]], with whom he formed a [[partnership]], [[J. &amp; G. Burns]]. Together, they started sailing ships between Glasgow and [[Liverpool]], as well as across the [[Atlantic]] to [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. J. &amp; G. Burns set up the regular [[Steamboat|steamer]] service to the [[Inner Hebrides|Inner]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. This was sold to David Hutcheson &amp; Co in 1851, and by the mid-1870s, it formed the basis of [[David MacBrayne Ltd]], which today operates as [[Caledonian MacBrayne]] across the west coast of [[Scotland]].

Burns was party to the consolidation of a number of companies, including the [[British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]], into the [[Cunard Line]], which had been begun by Sir [[Samuel Cunard]]. The Cunard Line merged with the [[White Star Line]] in 1936, and was to launch [[Ocean liner|liner]]s such as the [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']] (1936). Today it is a US-owned [[cruise ship|cruise]] company, which operated the famous [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth 2'']] (QE2).

In addition to his shipping interests, Burns was also one of the largest shareholders in [[Glasgow and South Western Railway|The Glasgow and South-Western Railway]]

Burns retired to [[Wemyss Bay]] in [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]] ([[Inverclyde]]). He was made a [[baronet]] at age 94 in 1889,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=25948 |date=25 June 1889 |page=3407}}&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest ever recipient of the award. A devout [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalian]], Edwin Hodder wrote a [[hagiography]] of Burns, and J.J. Burnet's Inverclyde Church was instituted in the memory of Burns and his wife. [[John William Burns|John Burns]] (1829–1901), his eldest son, succeeded him in the baronetcy, became head of the [[Cunard Line|Cunard Company]] and was created a peer, under the title of [[Baron Inverclyde]], in 1897.

The '''Sohn Conference Foundation''' was founded in 2006 to raise money to support medical research, the development of research equipment, and programs to help children with cancer and other childhood illnesses. {{As of|2018}} more than $85 million has been raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sohn-live-blog-top-investors-pitch-their-best-ideas-2018-04-23|title=Hedge-fund managers offer their top stock-market picks: Sohn live blog|last=Vlastelica|first=William Watts, Ryan|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sohn Conference was founded in 1995 in memory of Ira Sohn, a [[Wall Street]] professional, who died of [[cancer]] at the age of 29. At that time the Conference raised money for Tomorrow’s Children’s Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sohnconference.org/about/mission/|title=About Us {{!}} Sohn|last=Foundation|first=Sohn Conference|date=2015-11-13|newspaper=Sohn Conference Foundation|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation has 501(c)(3) non-profit status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reg.sohnconference.com/sohndonation/index.aspx|title=Sohn Conference Foundation|last=Foundation|first=Sohn Conference|website=reg.sohnconference.com|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was created after the premature death from cancer of Ira W. Sohn, by his friends and colleagues Douglas Hirsch, Lance Laifer and Daniel Nir, together with Sohn’s mother Judith Sohn and brother Evan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.beaconwealthmanagement.com/things-you-didnt-hear-from-the-sohn-investment-conference|title=Things You Didn't Hear from the Sohn Investment Conference|last=Powell|first=Tina|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the Foundation and [[CNBC]] announced a partnership to present the Sohn Investment Conferences in collaboration. The first conference presented as a partnership took place in New York City on May 4, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/09/the-sohn-conference-foundation-and-cnbc-strike-groundbreaking-global-partnership-for-renowned-sohn-investment-conferences.html|title=The Sohn Conference Foundation and CNBC Strike Groundbreaking Global Partnership for Renowned Sohn Investment Conferences|last=CNBC|date=2016-03-09|website=CNBC|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stelio Belletti''' (born November 19, 1932 in [[Mantua]]) is an Italian craftsman and entrepreneur and specialized in bicycle frame construction. He founded the brand [[Stelbel]] in 1973.

==Career==

===In aviation===
At the end of World War II, at the age of 13, Stelio Belletti began working for his father [[Antenore Belletti]] in his workshop in via Giovanni Antonio Amadeo in the Ortica district of [[Milan]], where they repaired and built tubular steel aircraft fuselages. 
They produced fuselages for some important aeronautical companies in Milan, working for the most part with the [[Società Italiana Ernesto Breda]] where his father, [[Antenore Belletti]], apprenticed in the years before the war started. 
In the early years of working with his father, they receive important commissions from [[Fratelli Nardi]] and [[Caproni]] di [[Taliedo]]. 
In the 50s, they established a relationship with the newly founded [[Aviamilano]] owned by [[Mario Vietri]], who commissions a variety of projects from Belletti. The projects were often contracted through the engineer [[Stelio Frati]], who regularly commissioned projects from the Belletti workshop, the majority of which were prototypes. One of the most important projects was the development of a fuselage for the [[Sequoia Falco|F.8L Falco]], a lightweight aircraft designed by Frati. They also built all the fuselages for the [[Aviamilano Scricciolo|P.19 Aircraft]], also for [[Aviamilano]] and designed by the engineer Ermenegildo Preti. 
The Belletti Workshop, driven by the aviation industry, was one of the first in Italy to acquire TIG welding equipment from the American company Miller.

===In the motorcycle industry===
[[File:Honda GP 500 Belletti frame.jpg|thumb|[[Mike Hailwood]] [[Honda]] GP500 with a Belletti frame|266x266px]]
[[File:Linto500GP1969.jpg|thumb|[[Linto]] 500GP 1969|266x266px]]
Towards the end of the 50s, while continuing to work in the aviation industry, the Belletti Workshop began to establish important relationships in the motorcycle racing industry, working closely with Eng. [[Lino Tonti]], building motorcycle frames for racing competitions. Some of the first frames were built for [[Paton (motorcycles)|Paton]] in [[Milan]], who they continued to work with until 1973. Paton motorcycles with Belletti frames, or replicas of the same, are identified with the initials BL, as can be seen in the BL3-R model which is still in production today. 
Starting in the 60s, other important brands such as [[Linto]], [[Puch Frigerio]], and [[Guazzoni]] begin to commission the Belletti family to build prototypes and special motorcycle frames for racing. 
One of the most significant achievements within the motorcycle industry dates back to 1967. That year, Mike Hailwood was to take part in the World Championship with a [[Honda 500 GP]], but after the initial testing carried out that winter, the road racer began to complain about the performance of the frame. In 1967, the engineers at the Japanese company had been focused on developing the engine (which turned out to be among the most powerful in the Championship) and consequently decided not to make any further changes to the chassis. Referred by specialist [[Giuseppe Pattoni]], [[Mike Hailwood|Hailwood]] approached Stelio and Antenore Belletti as a private customer and commissioned them to construct a new chassis for his Honda 500 GP. They completed the tubular-steel [[double cradle frame]] in just 16 days. 
The Honda 500 GP motorcycle equipped with the new [[Belletti frame]] was used for the first time at the [[Mototemporada Romagnola]], in the [[Rimini]] stage on May 14, 1967. The road racer won the race, breaking the winning streak of racer [[Giacomo Agostini]] who rode a [[MV Agusta]]. The motorcycle was also used in the World Championship while testing the [[Hockenheim]] circuit, but Honda forbade the use of the motorcycle during the race and for all subsequent races. 
In 1968, they also began construction on a limited series of frames to equip the Gran Prix motorcycle [[Linto 500 GP]]; all the frames for this model were designed by Belletti’s friend, [[Lino Tonti]], and built by Belletti. 
The Belletti workshop continued to work in the motorcycle industry until the early 70s.

===In the bicycle industry===
Stelio Belletti has been passionate about racing bicycles ever since he was a boy. Starting in the 70s, he began to race in local and amateur competitions with excellent results.
Spurred by a dry-spell in his family’s workshop and the dissatisfaction he felt towards the most recent racing bicycle he had purchased, Stelio Belletti tried his hand at bicycle frame building. His results encouraged him to found the Stelbel brand in 1973. 
Having honed his TIG welding skills while working in the aviation industry, he became the first Italian frame builder to build TIG welded frames. 
In 1975, Stelio Belletti patented the first bicycle frame welded with TIG welding techniques in Italy and that same year produced the frames for the Polish national team, who went on to win the gold medal in the men’s team time trial race at the [[1975 UCI Road World Championships|UCI Road World Championships]] in [[Mettet]]. 
By the second half of the 70s, the Belletti workshop concentrated on the production of Stelbel bicycle frames, and gradually began to decrease their commitment in other areas of production. 
In the early 80s, for age reasons, his father Antenore left the company to Stelio, and under his management the company hired additional employees. 

Stelio Belletti is recognized to have been on the forefront of bicycle frame construction, always pushing the boundaries and experimenting with new solutions. He remembers being one of the first manufacturers to make stainless steel frames. 
Belletti continued to work in his family’s workshop until 1990 when the company closed. 
Over the following years, Belletti collaborated with other Italian brands producing TIG welded frames made with steel or aluminum tubing. 
Upon his retirement, Stelio Belletti has devoted his time to sports, participating in several cycling events, and even organizing some himself.  &lt;ref&gt;Information from the official Stelbel website www.stelbel.it&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Tokumei Kakarichō Tadano Hitoshi'''''|特命係長·只野仁||lit. "Mission Section Chief Hitoshi Tadano"|lead=yes}} is a Japanese television drama, or [[Japanese television drama|drama]] based on the popular [[manga]] of the same name by [[Kimio Yanagisawa]]. The manga is described as a "[[salaryman]] and action manga." The television drama was aired on [[TV Asahi]] in 2003, the official English name of the drama is '''Hitoshi Tadano, the Extraordinary Undercover Detective'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tv-asahihd.co.jp/e/contents/presentation/data/200702/200702_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. A new drama series started airing in 2012 as '''Detective Anonymous'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/ips/contents/Drama/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manga volumes==
There are two series: ''Tokumei Kakarichō Tadano Hitoshi'' (9 volumes, or [[tankōbon]], published from December 14, 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:特命係長只野仁 (1) (ぶんか社コミックス)|publisher=Amazon.co.jp|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4821198525/ |accessdate=November 23, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; to June 15, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:特命係長只野仁 (9) (ぶんか社コミックス)|publisher=Amazon.co.jp|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4821198843/ |accessdate=November 23, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''Shin Tokumei Kakarichō Tadano Hitoshi'' (20 volumes, published from May 27, 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:新・特命係長只野仁 (1) (ぶんか社コミックス)|publisher=Amazon.co.jp|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4821199521/ |accessdate=November 23, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; to October 25, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:新・特命係長只野仁 (20) (ぶんか社コミックス)|publisher=Amazon.co.jp|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4821185059/ |accessdate=November 23, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==TV drama==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
The first TV series broadcast on TV Asahi's "Friday Night Drama" slot from July 4, 2003 until September 19, 2003, and garnered an average rating of 12.0%, reaching a high point of 14.1% according to the [[Kantō region|Kantō Area]] Video Research group, the highest rating of any show in the "Friday Night Drama" slot. During the final episode of the first series, viewers were told that Tadano and Moriwaki were going to take a 15-month vacation traveling around to various [[onsen]] across Japan. A special titled ''Tokumei Kakarichō Tadano Hitoshi Returns'' was aired on December 22, 2004, just over 15 months since the final episode of the first series.

On January 14, 2005, the second series began airing, running through March 18, 2005. According to the Kantō Area Video Research group, the series achieved a 16.0% rating with the episodes airing on February 11 and 18. The final episode garnered a rating of over 20% in its timeslot, due largely to the main character, Tadano, collapsing during the episode due to being overworked. On August 7, 2005, the second special was aired, titled ''Nerawareta Serebu na Onna-tachi''. The special garnered a 19.3%, the second highest rating ever for a drama, and making it the most popular drama aired between August 1 and 7.

The third series began airing January 12, 2007.

While in the original manga Tadano is a "lone wolf", in the TV series he works in combination with Moriwaki, a character created for the TV series. Moriwaki has now made his appearance in the original manga.

Based on a comic by Kimio Yanagisawa, Tokumei Kakaricho Tadano Hitoshi is a story about salaried worker who leads a double life as inept manager at the company, but moonlights as a heavy for the chairman of the company, investigating corruption within and outside of the company.

Jin Tadano ([[Katsunori Takahashi]]) is an assistant manager of operations department. Most people calls him Hitoshi Tadano because Jin can be read as Hitoshi, and this rhymes with Tadano Hito (an ordinary person). He pretends to be useless employee, but that's just a guise to hide his true function within the company. He's really like a ninja working for the chairman of the Denoudo corporation, always on a secret assignment to protect the people and the projects that the company is involved with. He is looked down by most of his fellow employees as useless oaf, but few girls likes him for who he is. This includes the secretary of the chairman Noriko Tsubouchi (Atsuko Sakurai), TV broadcaster Mayuko Shinmizu ([[Rieko Miura]]), and his coworker Kazue Yamabuki ([[Yuri Ebihara]]).

In each episode he's involved in solving corruption, murder, kidnapping, and all sorts of problems the company and its clients gets involved with. The program is made for adult audience, and was aired during late night time slot. The theme and characters that appears in the story reflects this. There're humor, action, some sexuality, and intrigue that makes this an excellent drama series coming out of Japan.

The '''value of life''' is an economic [[value theory|value]] used to quantify the benefit of avoiding a fatality.&lt;ref name="DPMC" /&gt; It is also referred to as the cost of life, value of preventing a fatality (VPF) and implied cost of averting a fatality (ICAF). In [[social science|social]] and [[political science]]s, it is the [[marginal cost]] of death prevention in a certain class of circumstances. In many studies the value also includes the quality of life, the expected life time remaining, as well as the earning potential of a given person especially for an after the fact payment in a [[wrongful death claim]] [[lawsuit]].

As such, it is a statistical term, the cost of reducing the [[average]] number of deaths by one. It is an important issue in a wide range of disciplines including [[economics]], [[health care]], [[adoption]], [[political economy]], [[insurance]], [[worker safety]], [[environmental impact assessment]], and [[globalization]].&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

In industrial nations, the justice system considers a human life "priceless", thus illegalizing any form of slavery; i.e., humans cannot be bought at any price. However, with a limited supply of [[natural resource|resources]] or [[infrastructural capital]] (e.g. ambulances), or skill at hand, it is impossible to save every life, so some trade-off must be made. Also, this argument neglects the statistical context of the term. It is not commonly attached to lives of individuals or used to compare the value of one person's life relative to another person's. It is mainly used in circumstances of saving lives as opposed to taking lives or "producing" lives.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

==Treatment in economics==
There is no standard concept for the value of a specific human life in [[economics]]. However, when looking at risk/reward trade-offs that people make with regard to their health, economists often consider the value of a statistical life (VSL). The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] does not place a dollar value on individual lives. Rather, when conducting a cost-benefit analysis of new environmental policies, the Agency uses estimates of how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in their risks of dying from adverse health conditions that may be caused by environmental pollution.These estimates of willingness to pay for small reductions in mortality risks are often referred to as the value of a statistical life (VSL).&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/mortality-risk-valuation| title=Mortality Risk Valuation| publisher=EPA| language=en|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VSL is the value that an individual places on a [[Marginal concepts|marginal]] change in their likelihood of death. Note that the VSL is very different from the value of an actual life.  It is the value placed on changes in the likelihood of death, not the price someone would pay to avoid certain death. This is best explained by way of an example. From the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]'s website:&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose each person in a sample of 100,000 people were asked how much he or she would be willing to pay for a reduction in their individual risk of dying of 1 in 100,000, or 0.001%, over the next year. Since this reduction in risk would mean that we would expect one fewer death among the sample of 100,000 people over the next year on average, this is sometimes described as "one statistical life saved.” Now suppose that the average response to this hypothetical question was $100. Then the total dollar amount that the group would be willing to pay to save one statistical life in a year would be $100 per person × 100,000 people, or $10 million. This is what is meant by the "value of a statistical life.” &lt;ref name="EPA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Economists often estimate the VSL by looking at the risks that people are voluntarily willing to take and how much they must be paid for taking them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mankiw|first=Gregory|title=Principles of Economics|date=2012|isbn=978-0-538-45305-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of studies, which look at a person's actual choices, are known as [[revealed preference]] studies.  A common source of such choices is the labor market, where jobs with greater risk of death are seen to correlate with higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-08/documents/ee-0563-1.pdf| title=Valuing Mortality Risk Reductions for Environmental Policy| publisher=US EPA| date=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of this research uses a wage [[Hedonic regression|hedonic]] approach, which looks at how wages change with changes in job characteristics.  Such studies [[Regression analysis|regress]] wages on job characteristics like risk of death, occupation, industry, risk of injury, location, etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}   By [[Independent variable#Controlled experiments|controlling]] for as many job characteristics as possible, researchers hope to tease out the portion of the wage that is compensating for the risk of death on the job. A recent summary of this literature is the 2003 paper by [[W. Kip Viscusi|Viscusi]] and Aldy.&lt;ref name=ViscusiAldy&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Viscusi|first1=W. Kip| first2=Joseph E.| last2=Aldy| title=The Value of a Statistical Life: A Critical Review of Market Estimates Throughout the World | journal= Journal of Risk and Uncertainty |date=2003 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=5–76 |doi=10.1023/A:1025598106257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method economists can use to estimate the VSL is by simply asking people (e.g. through questionnaires) how much they would be willing to pay for a reduction in the likelihood of dying, perhaps by purchasing safety improvements. These types of studies are referred to as [[Choice modelling#Stated preference|stated preference]] studies. A well known problem with this method is the so-called "[[hypothetical bias]]", whereby people tend to overstate their valuation of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=James|author2=P. Geoffrey Allen|author3=Thomas H. Stevens|author4=Darryl Weatherhead|last-author-amp=yes|title=A Meta-analysis of Hypothetical Bias in Stated Preference Valuation|journal=Environmental and Resource Economics|date=August 2004|volume=30|issue=3|pages=313–325|doi=10.1007/s10640-004-3332-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy applications of the VSL===
VSL estimates from wage hedonics are what the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] uses when evaluating health benefits from programs. From the EPA's:

:''Beginning in 2004 EPA's Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) used an estimate of $5.5 million (1999 dollars; $6.6 million in 2006 dollars) for the analysis of air regulations. This estimate was derived from the range of values estimated in three [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] of VSL conducted after EPA's Guidelines were published in 2000 (Mrozek and Taylor (2000), Viscusi and Aldy (2003), and later, Kochi, et al. (2006).) However, the Agency neither changed its official guidance on the use of VSL in rule-makings nor subjected the interim estimate to a scientific peer-review process through the Science Advisory Board (SAB) or other peer-review group.''&lt;ref name="EPA" /&gt;

Data for these studies frequently include wage data from the [[Current Population Survey]] and workplace risk data from the [http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.toc.htm Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries].  Both sets of data are collected on behalf of the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mrozek|first=J.R.|author2=Laura Taylor |title=What Determines the Value of Life? A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|date=2001|volume=21|issue=2|pages=253–270.|doi=10.1002/pam.10026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, the [http://www.epa.gov/oar/sect812/copy.html EPA's retrospective study of the clean air act], which focused "primarily on the criteria pollutants sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, ozone, and lead", found that the benefits of the program, mostly from improvements to health, outweighed the costs:

:''The direct benefits of the Clean Air Act from 1970 to 1990 include reduced incidence of a number of adverse human health effects, improvements in visibility, and avoided damage to agricultural crops. Based on the assumptions employed, the estimated economic value of these benefits ranges from $5.6 to $49.4 trillion, in 1990 dollars, with a mean, or central tendency estimate, of $22.2 trillion. These estimates do not include a number of other potentially important benefits which could not be readily quantified, such as ecosystem changes and air toxics-related human health effects. The estimates are based on the assumption that correlations between increased air pollution exposures and adverse health outcomes found by epidemiological studies indicate causal relationships between the pollutant exposures and the adverse health effects.''{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

:''The direct costs of implementing the Clean Air Act from 1970 to 1990, including annual compliance expenditures in the private sector and program implementation costs in the public sector, totaled $523 billion in 1990 dollars.''{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The value of improvements to health conditions were converted to dollars by estimating the resulting decrease in the incidence of fatalities and valuing this change using estimations of the VSL from the literature. A table of specific values used for the various improvements in health can be found in the report's [http://www.epa.gov/oar/sect812/1970-1990/812exec2.pdf executive summary].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Tobacco industry==
The cigarette industry was particularly concerned with value of life calculations since it came under regular attack in the 1980s and 1990s for the "social cost" of smoking on the national economy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}   The economic argument for increasing excise taxes on cigarettes was that these taxes compensated the state for a whole range of [[Externality|externalities]] that smoking imposed, including the costs of hospital and medical care for smokers and non-smokers alike, disability pensions for smoking-related diseases, welfare payments made to surviving spouses, the cost of street, home and office cleaning, the burden of home and forest fires, etc. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

To counter this argument, the tobacco industry was increasingly forced to fall back on calculations made by a network of employed academics, who were paid to write op-ed articles for their local newspapers expressing the opinion that smokers already 'paid their way'.  [http://sciencecorruption.com/ATN167/01713.html]{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}  They relied on an argument by Kip Viscusi which became known as the "death benefits"—the idea that, since smokers died earlier than non-smokers, the nation was being saved hospital, pension and nursing-home costs, and that these offset many of the external costs (depending on how these are calculated).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Uses==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Since resources are finite, [[trade-off]]s are inevitable, even regarding potential life-or-death decisions. The assignment of a value to individual life is one possible approach to attempting to make [[rational decision]]s about these trade-offs.

When deciding on the appropriate level of healthcare spending, a typical method is to equate the marginal cost of the healthcare to the marginal benefits received. In order to obtain a marginal benefit amount, some estimation of the dollar value of life is required.
However the level that can be done is limited by available resources.  So even though it may be 'beneficial' to spend more it is not possible, or else requires deficit spending which causes other intended consequences that are hoped to be less{{needs citation|date=August 2018}}.

The rational strategy is to determine how much can be spent on saving lives and then allocating it to the most beneficial ways until the money is fully allocated.

In [[risk management]] activities such as in the areas of [[occupational safety and health|workplace safety]], and insurance, it is often useful to put a precise economic value on a given life. There can be no such thing as a perfectly safe or risk free system—one can always make a system safer by spending more money. However, there are [[production theory basics|diminishing returns]] involved.

In transportation modes it is very important to consider the [[external cost]] that is paid by the society but is not calculated, for making it more [[sustainable]]. The external cost, although consisting of impacts on [[climate]], [[crops]] and [[public health]] among others, is largely determined by impacts on [[mortality rate]].

==Estimates of the value of life==
Equivalent parameters are used in many countries, with significant variation in the value assigned.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Miller| first=Ted R| title=Variations between Countries in Values of Statistical Life| journal=Journal of Transport Economics and Policy| volume=34| pages=169–188| date=May 2000| url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/e-journals/jtep/pdf/Volume_34_Part_2_169-188.pdf| issn=0022-5258| access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
According to different estimates life value in Russia varies from $40,000 up to $2 million. On the results of opinion poll life value (as the cost of financial compensation for the death) in the beginning of 2015 was about $71,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rgs.ru/media/CSR/on_startup/Life_value_2015.pdf|title = Стоимость человеческой жизни в России в 2015 году составила 4,5 млн. рублей|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Center for Strategic Researches RGS|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
