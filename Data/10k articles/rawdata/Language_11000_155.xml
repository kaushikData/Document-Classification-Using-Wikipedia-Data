The '''allergic salute''' (sometimes called the '''nasal salute''') is the characteristic and sometimes habitual gesture of wiping and/or rubbing the nose in an upwards or [[wikt:transverse|transverse]] manner with the fingers, palm, or back of the hand. It is termed a ''salute'' because the upward movement of the hand acts as an unintentional gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jim McMorran |author2=Damian Crowther |author3=Stew McMorran |author4=Steve Youngmin |author5=Ian Wacogne |author6=Jon Pleat |author7=Clive Prince |url=http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=-1167392718 |title=allergic salute - General Practice Notebook |publisher=Gpnotebook.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The habit of using the hand to wipe the nose is observed more often in children but is common in adults as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/allergic+salute |title=Allergic Salute |publisher=Medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinetoday.com.au/2007/november/article/allergic-rhinitis-spring-action#.VNveDmTF8Yc |title=Allergic rhinitis: spring into action |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saluting most commonly temporarily relieves nasal itching as well as removing small amounts of nasal mucus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acaai.org/allergist/Resources/ask-allergist/Pages/Ask_the_Allergist-What_Are_Allergic_Shiners.aspx |title=Ask the Allergist - What Are Allergic Shiners |publisher=Acaai.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In people who are experiencing seizures, nose wiping has been observed as a semivoluntary action.&lt;ref name= Fisher&gt;{{Citation

==Process==
The upwards wiping of the nose and nostrils allows for running mucus to be wiped off quickly and easily. Also, as the nostrils are being pushed up the air passages through the nose become temporarily propped open. This is especially beneficial if the air passages are swollen and the nostrils are itchy due to irritations such as [[allergic rhinitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =N.J |url=http://my-health-inf.blogspot.com/2007/09/what-is-salute.html |title=What is an "Allergic Salute"? |publisher=My-health-inf.blogspot.com |date=2012-01-08 |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mucus that is wiped onto the hand will most likely carry bacteria and other germs which could then in turn be passed along to other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.ny.gov/publications/7110/ |title=This is How Germs Spread...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2318">'''Aodh Ollabhar Ó Carrthoidh''' aka '''Aodh Ollbhar Ó Cárthaigh''', [[Gaels|Gaelic]]-[[Irish people|Irish]] poet, fl. mid-15th century.

==Overview==

[[Ó Cárthaigh]] was an [[Irish people|Irish]] poet who was active sometime in the middle years of the 15th century. His family were natives of [[Uí Maine]].

He is known from a single surviving poem,''Tosach féile fairsinge'', which survives in the following [[manuscripts]]:

* [[National Library of Scotland|NLS]] Adv 72/1/37 [[Book of the Dean of Lismore|Bk Dean Lism]]. first half of the 16th century
* [[Royal Irish Academy|RIA]] 743 (A/iv/3) 17th century
* RIA 785(23/G/8)[[Tadhg Ó Neachtain|T.ONeachtain]] et al.1711
* RIA3(23/L/17) S. OMurch.na R. 1744-5

It was published in 1938. It concerns the families of ''[[Mulrooney|Ó Maol Ruanaidh]] rí Céise'' and [[Mac Diarmata]] of [[Moylurg]]. It mentions ''Tomhaltach Mac Diarmuda/mac na ríoghna ó [[Rathcroghan|Ráith Chruachan]]'', and so may date from during or after Tomhaltach's lifetime. Rulers of Moylurg named Tomaltach were:

* [[Tomaltach na Cairge mac Diarmata]], ruled 1196-1207
* Tomaltach Cear mac Diarmata, 1331–1336
* Tomaltach an Einigh mac Diarmata, 1421–1458

The Bardic Poetry Database [http://bardic.celt.dias.ie/main.html] lists the subject of the poem as ''Tomaltach mc Conch.mhcAodha mhcCon MacDiarmada'', who died in 1458.

Other poems by Ó Cárthaigh may survive, but if so, are unattributed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2926">'''Counterproliferation''' refers to [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]], [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]], and [[military]] efforts to combat the proliferation of [[weapon]]s, including both [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD), long-range missiles, and certain [[conventional weapon]]s. [[Nonproliferation]] and [[arms control]] are related terms.  In contrast to nonproliferation, which focuses on diplomatic, legal and administrative measures to dissuade and impede the acquisition of such weapons, counter-proliferation focuses on intelligence, law enforcement, and sometimes military action to prevent their acquisition.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Weapons delivery==

===Missile technology===
Long-range missile technology is of greatest threat when the missiles carry weapons of mass destruction, but long-range weapons with precision guidance can be serious threats with explosive or other conventional warheads. This has been supplemented by the [[International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation]] (ICOC), also known as the Hague Code of Conduct.

Technical means of verification, including space-based sensors that can scan large parts of the world, can provide early warning of long-range missile development. [[Electro-optical MASINT#Space-based staring infrared sensors|Space-based Staring Infrared Sensors]] can detect the heat of rocket launching motors. Various radars can monitor range and other characteristics, but they need to be in a place where they have line-of-sight to the missile trajectory. The United States, probably Russia, and possibly other nations have aircraft-based and ship-based sensors that can monitor such tests, but there has to be warning of potential tests so these sensors can be deployed.

In religion, a '''covenant''' is a formal alliance or agreement made by [[God]] with a religious community or with humanity in general. It is central to the [[Abrahamic religions]] and derived from the [[covenant (biblical)|biblical covenants]], notably the [[Abrahamic covenant]].

==Usage==
{{See|Covenant (law)}}
A covenant in its most general sense and [[covenant (historical)|historical sense]], is a solemn promise to engage in or refrain from a specified action. A covenant is a type of agreement analogous to a [[contract]]ual [[terms and conditions|condition]]. The covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to do (affirmative covenant) or not do some action (negative covenant).

Covenant is the customary word used to [[Bible translations|translate]] the [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] word ''berith''.&lt;ref&gt;(ברית [[Tiberian Hebrew]] ''bərîṯ'' [[Standard Hebrew]] ''bərit'')&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in the [[Masoretic Text]] 264 times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newjerusalem.org/Strongs.aspx?search=H1285]&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent word in the [[Septuagint]] and the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]] is {{lang|grc|διαθήκη}}, ''diatheke''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/words.pl?word=1242 The Blue Letter Bible, Strong's G1242.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{main|Covenant (biblical)|Mosaic covenant}}
The Mosaic covenant refers to a [[Covenant (biblical)|biblical covenant]] between God and the [[Israelites#Biblical Israelites|biblical Israelites]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12391-proselyte Jewish Encyclopedia: Proselyte]: "...Isa. lvi. 3-6 enlarges on the attitude of those that joined themselves to Yhwh, "to minister to Him and love His name, to be His servant, keeping the Sabbath from profaning it, and laying hold on His covenant.""&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|20:8|HE}}: "thy stranger that is within thy gates"&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment and stipulations of the Mosaic covenant are recorded in the first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]], which are traditionally attributed to [[Mosaic authorship]] and collectively called the [[Torah]], and this covenant is sometimes also referred to as the [[Law of Moses]] or Mosaic Law or the [[613 Mitzvot]].

Covenants are often initiated by an [[oath]] and can be of two types: grants or treaties.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Grants are generally unilateral, unconditional covenants such as those where God made unconditional promises to Noah (Genesis 9), Abraham (Genesis 15, Genesis 17) and David (2 Samuel 7:8ff).{{cn|date=July 2018}} Bilateral covenants are generally conditional with blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience as in Deuteronomy 28 and 30.

[[Biblical theology]] and [[systematic theology]] for covenants often intertwines the unilateral and the bilateral, the conditional and the unconditional, such that much has been written and said about "Old" and "New" Covenants and the extent to which the "Old Covenant" still persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Avery Dulles|Dulles SJ]] |first1=Avery |title=The Covenant with Israel |journal=First Things |date=November 2005 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2005/11/the-covenant-with-israel |accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The typology of covenants is governed by the distribution of covenant obligations between the covenanting parties.&lt;ref name="ScottHahn"&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Scott Hahn|Hahn]] |first1=Scott W. |title=Kinship by Covenant: A Canonical Approach to the Fulfillment of God's Saving Promises |date=2009 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=9780300140972 |pages=589 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Kinship-Covenant-Canonical-Fulfillment-Reference/dp/0300140975 |accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Covenant is a [[biblical interpretation]] originally derived from a [[Book of Jeremiah#Sections of the Book|phrase in the Book of Jeremiah]], in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Generally, [[Christian theology|Christians believe]] that the New Covenant was instituted at the [[Last Supper]] as part of the [[Eucharist]], which in the [[Gospel of John]] includes the [[New Commandment]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

There are several [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatologies]] that further define the New Covenant. For example, an [[inaugurated eschatology]] defines and describes the New Covenant as an ongoing relationship between Christian believers and God that will be in full fruition after the [[Second Coming of Christ]]; that is, it will not only be in full fruition in believing hearts, but in the [[World to Come#Christian eschatology|future external world]] as well.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The connection between the [[blood of Christ]] and the New Covenant is seen in most modern [[English translations of the Bible|English translations of the New Testament]]&lt;ref&gt;but not in the [[KJV]] for example&lt;/ref&gt; with the saying: "this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22&amp;version=ESV |title=Luke 22:20 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant, and that the blood of Christ shed at his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] is the [[Propitiation|required blood of the covenant]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} As with all covenants between God and man described in the Bible, the New Covenant is considered "a bond in blood sovereignly administered by God."&lt;ref&gt;This definition of covenant is from [[O. Palmer Robertson]]'s book ''The Christ of the Covenants''. It has become an accepted definition among modern scholars. See this [http://www.apuritansmind.com/Baptism/McMahonOverviewRobertsonsBookChrist.htm critical review of his book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113194042/http://apuritansmind.com/Baptism/McMahonOverviewRobertsonsBookChrist.htm |date=2007-11-13 }} by Dr. C. Matthew McMahon.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorized that the New Covenant is the [[Law of Christ]] as spoken during his [[Sermon on the Mount]].&lt;ref&gt;George R. Law, “The Form of the New Covenant in Matthew,” ''American Theological Inquiry'' 5:2 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Covenant theology]], a theological system within [[Reformed Christianity]], holds that God relates to man primarily through three covenants: the [[Covenant of Redemption]], the [[covenant of works|Covenant of Works]], and the [[Covenant of Grace]]. In this theological system a covenant may be defined as, "an unchangeable, divinely imposed legal agreement between God and man that stipulates the conditions of their relationship."&lt;ref&gt;Grudem, Wayne A. "The Covenants Between God and Man." Systematic Theology: an Introduction to Biblical Doctrine. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2000. 515. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter Day Saints===
{{Main|Covenant (Latter Day Saints)}}
In the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], a covenant is a promise made between [[God the Father|God]] and a person or a group of people.&lt;ref name = ldsorg&gt;[//www.lds.org/topics/covenant "Covenant"], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt; God sets the conditions of the covenant, and as the conditions are met, he blesses the person who entered into and kept the covenant. If the covenant is violated, blessings are withheld and in some cases a penalty or punishment is inflicted.&lt;ref name = ldsorg/&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) teaches that one enters a covenant through a ritual or a visible sign.&lt;ref name = eom&gt;Wouter Van Beek, [http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Covenants "Covenants"], in ''[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]'' (New York: Macmillan, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Some leaders have taught that a covenant is always associated with an [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis B. Neuenschwander, [//www.lds.org/ensign/2001/08/ordinances-and-covenants "Ordinances and Covenants"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Other leaders have suggested that commandments that include promised blessings for compliance—such as the [[tithe (Mormonism)|law of tithing]] and [[Word of Wisdom]]—also constitute covenants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marion G. Romney]], [//www.lds.org/ensign/1981/05/gospel-covenants "Gospel Covenants"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', May 1981, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the LDS Church, ordinances which are accompanied by covenants include [[Baptism (Latter Day Saints)|baptism]] and [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmation]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/mosiah/18/8-10,13#8 Mosiah 18:8–10, 13]; [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/20/37#37 Doctrine and Covenants 20:37]; [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/39/23#23 Doctrine and Covenants 39:23]&lt;/ref&gt; partaking of the [[Sacrament (LDS Church)|sacrament]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/20/75-79#75 Doctrine and Covenants 20:75–79]&lt;/ref&gt; reception of the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/84/33-40#33 Doctrine and Covenants 84:33–39]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Endowment (Mormonism)|temple endowment]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/124/39#39 Doctrine and Covenants 124:39]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[celestial marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/132/15-20#15 Doctrine and Covenants 132:15–20]&lt;/ref&gt; These are known as "saving ordinances" and are a requirement for [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]].

Officially, partaking of the sacrament is considered by the LDS Church to be a renewal of the covenants made at baptism;&lt;ref name = eom/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/gs/s/2 Guide to the Scriptures: Sacrament], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt; however, some Latter-day Saint leaders have taught that doing so constitutes a renewal of all covenants a person has made.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.lds.org/ensign/1995/03/i-have-a-question "I Have a Question"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', March 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
The original covenant made between God and mankind marked the beginning of creation according to [[Islamic theology]]. It is believed that before the creation of the heavens and the earth, God assembled all of creation (that would ever exist) in a timeless, placeless region and informed them of the truth of his existence. This moment is referred to in the verse 7:172 of the [[Quran]] as follows:  
{{quote|When thy Lord drew forth their descendants from the children of Adam, He made them testify concerning themselves [saying]: 'Am I not your Lord?' They replied, 'Yes, we do so testify'.}}

This covenant is significant in that it asserts that an understanding of the origin of man is something deeply inherent to and natural within every person. Any disconnection from this memory is referred to as being ‘forgetful’ within the scripture, ''[[hadith]]'' literature and commentary. The Quran constantly implores people to recall and remember. Scholars suggest that the call to remember throughout the Quran is in fact a call to remember this particular moment in their spiritual history. Suggestions are also made that where people recognise people with ease, it is usually as a memory from this event. To strive to remember through invocations and contemplation is thus considered a form of worship in Islam called ''[[dhikr]]''.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

There are many scholarly perspectives taken on the significance of this covenant. It is understood as marking the beginning of human consciousness with mankind making their first conscious response to the divine question 'Am I not your lord?'. Some also see it as being relevant to the Islamic principle of ''[[Tawhid]]'' or unity as the entirety of mankind was said to have been assembled on the plane on this date.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Another perspective is that as an Abrahamic faith, the covenant was made with Abraham. Any person confessing to faith can become a [[Muslim]] and partake of this covenant with God: 
{{quote|Remember We made the House a place of assembly for men and a place of safety; and take ye the station of Abraham as a place of prayer; and We Covenanted with Abraham and Isma'il, that they should sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or use it as a retreat, or bow, or prostrate themselves (therein in prayer).{{Cite quran|2|125}}}}

Gerhard Bowering has written about the mystical aspects of the Covenant in Islam.&lt;ref name="Bowering1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerhard Böwering|title=The Mystical Vision of Existence in Classical Islam: The Qur'anic Hermeneutics of the Sufi Sahl At-Tustari|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UabRPEv_Lq0C|year=1979|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-083705-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other religions==
In [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Indo-Iranian]] religious tradition, [[Mithra]]-[[Mitra]] is the [[Hypostasis (linguistics)|hypostasis]] of covenant, and hence keeper and protector of moral, social and interpersonal relationships, including love and friendship.{{cn|date=July 2018}} In living [[Zoroastrianism]], which is one of the two primary developments of Indo-Iranian religious tradition, Mithra is by extension a judge, protecting agreements by ensuring that individuals who break one do not enter [[Heaven]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

'''Cultural assimilation''' is the process in which a [[minority group]] or [[culture]] comes to resemble those of a dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Boyer |first1=P |title=Cultural Assimilation |journal=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences |date=2001 |pages=3032–3035 |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/00364-8|isbn=9780080430768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is used to refer to both individuals and groups; the latter case can refer to a range of social groups, including [[ethnic minorities]], [[immigrants]], [[indigenous peoples]], and other marginalized groups such as [[sexual minorities]] who adapt to being culturally dominated by another societal group.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Cultural assimilation may involve either a quick or a gradual change depending on circumstances of the group. Full assimilation occurs when members of a society become indistinguishable from those of the dominant group. 

Whether it is desirable for a given group to assimilate is often disputed by both members of the group and those of the dominant society. Cultural assimilation does not guarantee social alikeness.

though as this article states, geographical and other natural barriers between cultures even if started by the same dominant culture will be culturally different.&lt;ref&gt;Parisi, Domenico, Federico Cecconi, and Francesco Natale. "Cultural change in spatial environments: the role of cultural assimilation and internal changes in cultures." ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' 47.2 (2003): 163–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A place, state, or ethnicity can spontaneously adopt a different culture because of its political relevance or its perceived cultural superiority. An example is the [[Latin]] language and [[Roman culture]] being gradually adopted by most of the people subjugated by [[Ancient Rome]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Cultural assimilation can happen either spontaneously or forcibly (''see [[forced assimilation]]''). A culture can spontaneously adopt a different culture. Also, older, richer, or otherwise more dominant cultures can forcibly absorb subordinate cultures.

The term assimilation is often used with regard to not only indigenous groups but also immigrants settled in a new land. A new culture and new attitudes toward the origin culture are obtained through contact and communication. Assimilation assumes that a relatively-tenuous culture gets to be united to one unified culture. That process happens by contact and accommodation between each culture. The current definition of assimilation is usually used to refer to immigrants, but in [[multiculturalism]], cultural assimilation can happen all over the world and within varying social contexts and is not limited to specific areas. For example, a shared language gives people the chance to study and work internationally, without being limited to the same cultural group. People from different countries contribute to diversity and form the "global culture" which means the culture combined by the elements from different countries. That "global culture" can be seen as a part of assimilation, which causes cultures from different areas to affect one another.

== Immigrant assimilation ==
Immigrant assimilation is a complex process in which immigrants not only fully integrate themselves into a new country but also lose aspects, perhaps even all of their heritage. Social scientists rely on four primary benchmarks to assess immigrant assimilation: [[socioeconomic status]], geographic distribution, [[second language]] attainment, and [[exogamy|intermarriage]].&lt;ref name="Waters" /&gt;  William A.V. Clark defines immigrant assimilation as "a way of understanding the social dynamics of American society and that it is the process that occurs spontaneously and often unintended in the course of interaction between majority and [[minority groups]]."&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=W. |year=2003 |title=Immigrants and the American Dream: Remaking the Middle Class |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-880-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States===
{{Further|Americanization (immigration)}}

Between 1880 and 1920, the United States took in roughly 24 million immigrants.&lt;ref name="Waters"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Waters |first=Mary C. |last2=Jiménez |first2=Tomás R. |title=Assessing Immigrant Assimilation: New Empirical and Theoretical Challenges |journal=[[Annual Review of Sociology]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=105–125 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100026 |url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3203280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This increase in immigration can be attributed to many historical changes. The beginning of the 21st century has also marked a massive era of immigration, and sociologists are once again trying to make sense of the impacts that immigration has on society and on the on immigrants themselves.&lt;ref name="Waters"/&gt;

Assimilation had various meanings in American sociology. [[Henry Pratt Fairchild]] associates American assimilation with Americanization or the ''[[melting pot]]'' theory. Some scholars also believed that assimilation and acculturation were synonymous. According to a common point of view, assimilation is a "process of interpretation and fusion" from another group or person. That may include memories, behaviors and sentiments. By sharing their experiences and histories, they blend into the common cultural life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/ecology-and-environmentalism/environmental-studies/assimilation|title=Assimilation facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Assimilation|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long history of immigration in the established gateways means that the place of immigrants in terms of [[social class|class]], [[race (classification of human beings)|racial]], and [[ethnic]] hierarchies in the traditional gateways are more structured or established, but on the other hand, the new gateways do not have much immigration [[history]] and so the place of immigrants in terms of class, racial, and ethnic hierarchies is less defined, and immigrants may have more influence to define their position. Secondly, the size of new gateways may influence immigrant assimilation. Having a smaller gateway may influence the level of [[racial segregation]] among immigrants and native-born people. Thirdly, the difference in institutional arrangements may influence immigrant assimilation. Traditional gateways, unlike new gateways, have many institutions set up to help immigrants such as legal aid, bureaus, social organizations. Finally, Waters and Jimenez have only speculated that those differences may influence immigrant assimilation and the way researchers that should assess immigrant assimilation.&lt;ref name="Waters"/&gt;

'''Dictema''' ({{lang-la|dico, dixi, dictum}} – "I say, I state") is an elementary situational-thematic unit of a text, formed of one or more sentences as units of the immediately lower level of language segments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.ua/m/articles/view/%D0%94%D0%98%D0%9A%D0%A2%D0%95%D0%9C%D0%90-%D0%92-%D0%A3%D0%A0%D0%9E%D0%92%D0%9D%D0%95%D0%92%D0%9E%D0%99-%D0%A1%D0%A2%D0%A0%D0%A3%D0%9A%D0%A2%D0%A3%D0%A0%D0%95-%D0%AF%D0%97%D0%AB%D0%9A%D0%90 ''Блох М. Я.'' Диктема в уровневой структуре языка // Вопросы языкознания. — М., 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of creation ==
The concept of the dictema was put forward by [[Mark Bloch (linguist)|Mark Bloch]] in the mid-twentieth century in connection with a scientific discussion on the communicative units of language as described by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] of the [[Geneva School]], as well as Professor Alexander Smirnitsky. In turn, Professor Bloch considered the level of language units that had gone unnoticed, namely the levels of the [[phoneme]] and [[morpheme]], to which he added the "third integral level of constructions with blurred boundaries" – syntax. Thus, following the creation of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] by [[Dionysius Thrax]] and [[syntax]] by [[Apollonius Dyscolus]], the isolation of the dictema represents another key stage in the history of [[grammar]].

== Structure ==
In a uniformly unfolding monologic written text, the dictema is usually represented by a paragraph, whereas in dialogical speech, the dictemma is usually represented by a rejoinder.&lt;ref&gt;''Ленская И. С.''  Проблема невербализованного содержания текста // Проблемы вербальной коммуникации и представления знаний. — Иркутск, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As an integrative unit of linguistic expression, the dictema distinguishes four main functionally significant aspects: naming, predication, thematization and stylization.

'''Egoboo''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|g|oʊ|b|uː}} is a [[slang|colloquial expression]] for the [[pleasure]] received from [[reputation|public recognition]] of voluntary work.

The term was in use in [[science fiction fandom]] as early as 1947, when it was used (spelled "ego boo") in a letter from [[Rick Sneary]] published in the [[letter column]] of ''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sneary, Rick. "Letter" ''Thrilling Wonder Stories" June 1947]&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally simply used to describe the "ego boost" someone feels on seeing their name in print. As a reliable way for someone to get their name in print was to do something worth mentioning, it became caught up with the idea of voluntary community participation. As a result of this, in later years, the term grew to mean something akin to an ephemeral [[currency]], e.g., "I got a lot of egoboo for editing that newsletter."

The term later spread into the [[open source programming]] [[Social movement |movement]], where the concept of non-monetary reward from community response is a key [[motivational|motivator]] for many of the participants.&lt;ref name=esr&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric S.|title=The Social Context of Open-Source Software|url= http://catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s11.html|work=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of its prevalence in this context, it is often attributed to [[Eric S. Raymond]]. However, it has been in use in science fiction fandom since 1947 or earlier, being referenced in the 1959 collection of fandom-related jargon ''Fancyclopedia II''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sff.net/people/diccon/CYINDEX.HTM Fancyclopedia II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011006033408/http://www.sff.net/people/diccon/cyindex.htm |date=2001-10-06 }} – index page&lt;/ref&gt; It did not, however, occur in the 1944 predecessor to that work, ''Fancyclopedia I'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://fanac.org/Fannish_Reference_Works/Fancyclopedia/Fancyclopedia_I/#E Fancyclopedia I] – #E&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting the term came into common use sometime in the intervening years. The first print citation available electronically is in a 1950 issue of [[Lee Hoffman]]'s ''Quandry'', where it is spelled "ego-boo";&lt;ref&gt;[http://fanac.org/fanzines/Quandry/Quandry5-12.jpeg Hoffman, Lee. "Presenting QUANDRY's neo-fan of the month" ''Quandry'' #5, p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt; later usage dropped the hyphen and blended the two words, a common feature of fannish jargon.

The earliest online citation recorded is a reference to it being used in 1982, describing [[InConJunction]], a [[science fiction convention]] in [[Indiana]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/net.sf-lovers/msg/988b7faf00af1308 net.sf-lovers] INCONJUNCTION II: AN SF CONVENTION&lt;/ref&gt; the high proportion of science fiction fans on [[Usenet]], and the [[Internet]] generally, in early years no doubt helped spread it into the wider computing community.

'''Elvish languages''' are [[constructed language]]s used by [[Elves in fantasy fiction and games|Elves]] in a [[fantasy]] setting.

==Tolkien's Elvish languages==
{{main|Elvish languages (Middle-earth)}}
Author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] created many languages for his [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], which eventuated in the creation of a mythology (expounded in his books), complete with races, to speak the languages he had constructed. The language has quickly spread among modern day use, resulting in [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] to become legally stated languages. His interest was primarily [[philology|philological]], and he said his stories grew out of his languages. The languages were the first thing Tolkien created for his mythos, starting with what he originally called "Qenya", the first primitive form of Elvish. This was later called [[Quenya]] (High-elven) and is one of the two most complete of Tolkien's languages (the other being [[Sindarin]], or Grey-elven). The phonology and grammar of Quenya are strongly influenced by [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and elements of ancient [[Germanic languages]], and Sindarin is strongly influenced by [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

Tolkien conceived a family tree of Elvish languages, all descending from a common ancestor called [[Primitive Quendian]]. He worked extensively on how the languages diverged from Primitive Quendian over time, in phonology and grammar, in imitation of the development of real language families. In addition to Quenya and Sindarin, he sketched several other Elvish languages in far less detail, such as [[Telerin]], Nandorin, and Avarin.

In addition to Tolkien's original lexicon, many fans have contributed words and phrases, attempting to create a language that can be fully used in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Solopova|"Invented Languages"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Elvish languages==
{{trivia|section|date=December 2017}}
Since Tolkien, others have invented Elvish languages in their own fiction. Several borrow sounds and forms (or even whole words) from Tolkien's Elvish languages, especially Quenya, while others are quite distinct.

*''Elvish,'' the language spoken in the book titled [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40215820-elvish Elvish], by S.G. Prince. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elvish|last=Prince|first=S.G.|publisher=|year=|isbn=1521435480|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Elven'', the language of [[RuneScape]]'s Elves, is basically Welsh with a slight twist.{{clarification needed|date=May 2017}}
*''The Ancient Language'' The language of the elves in [[The Inheritance Cycle]]. Also used by the riders and other magic users to cast spells. It was based on [[Old Norse]] and was the language of the now extinct Grey Folk. One cannot lie in the Ancient Language and is bound by what one says in it.
*''Elven'', the language of the surface [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Elves]] of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (of which there are several dialects including ''Ssamath'' of the [[Drow (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Drow]], which drow use in conjunction with Deep Speech).
*''Ellylon'' and ''Hen Llinge'' (''Elder Speech'') - elvish languages of [[Andrzej Sapkowski]]'s ''[[The Witcher]]'' saga, based on [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]].
*''Eltharin'', the language of the elves of [[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer Fantasy setting]]:
**''Fan-Eltharin'', the language of the Wood Elves.
**''Tar-Eltharin'', the language of the Sea Elves and High Elves
**''Druhir'', the language of the Dark Elves
*''[[Sperethiel]]'', The language of elves in [[Shadowrun]].
*Elvish language of [[Gael Baudino]]'s ''[[The Strands Series|Strands]]'' series, based on the [[Romance languages]].
*The Elvish language(s) of the [[Warcraft universe]] (Darnassian, Nazja, and  Thalassian), are not described in detail but superficially resemble Tolkien's. Together, Darnassian, Nazja, and Thalassian are considered the modern elvish tongues of the Warcraft universe spoken by the modern Kaldorei, the Naga, and the highborne (respectively) while Elvish itself is considered an ancient tongue that is no longer used as a primary language. It is assumed that Elvish is the language from which Darnassian evolved; Darnassian then branched into Nazja, spoken underwater by the kaldorei that followed Queen Azshara after the sundering, and later on, Thalassian, which is spoken by the highborne as well as the Blood Elves.
*"[[Gnommish]]" The language of the [[Artemis Fowl (series)|Artemis Fowl]] series, sometimes read in a spiral.
*''Elvish'', the language of the Dalish elves in the ''[[Dragon Age]]'' series of videogames (and, to an extremely limited extent, the City Elves as well).
*The Elves, or Mer, of the universe of [[The Elder Scrolls]], use various languages derived from ancient Ehlnofex. Such languages include Dunmeris, Pyandonean, Orcish (Orsimeris) and Bosmeris, among others.
*The elves in the film ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'' speak a language based on [[Old Irish]].
*''Shiväisith'' - language of the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)|Dark Elves]] in ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' constructed by [[David J. Peterson]].
*''Övüsi'' - The Elvish Language from [[Bright (film)|Bright]].

'''Experimental factor ontology''', also known as '''EFO''', is an [[Open access (publishing)|open-access]] [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] of [[Dependent and independent variables|experimental variables]] particularly those used in [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref name=pmid20200009/&gt; The ontology covers variables which include aspects of disease, [[anatomy]], [[cell type]], [[Immortalised cell line|cell lines]], [[chemical compound]]s and [[assay]] information. EFO is developed and maintained at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EMBL-EBI]] as a cross-cutting resource for the purposes of curation, querying and data integration&lt;ref name=pmid24271396&gt;{{cite journal |pages=D18-D25 |doi= 10.1093/nar/gkt1206 |title=The European Bioinformatics Institute's data resources 2014 |year=2014 |last1=Brooksbank|first1=C. |last2=Bergman |first2=M.T. |last3=Apweiler |first3=A. |last4=Birney |first4=E. |last5=Thornton |first5=J. = |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=42 |pmid=24271396 |pmc=3964968  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in resources such as [[Ensembl]],&lt;ref name=ensembl2014&gt;{{cite journal |pages=D749-D755 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkt1196 |title=Ensembl 2014| year=2014 |last1=Flicek |first1=P. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume= 42|pmid=24316576 | pmc=3964975}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ChEMBL]] and Expression Atlas.&lt;ref name=atlas&gt;{{cite journal |pages=D690-D698 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkp936 |title=Gene Expression Atlas at the European Bioinformatics Institute| year=2010 |last1=Kapushesky|first1=M. | last2=Emam| first2=I | last3=Holloway| first3=E | last4=Kurnosov | first4=P| last5=Zorin|first5=A|last6=Malone | first6=J | last7=Rustici| first7=G |last8=Williams| first8=E |last9=Parkinson| first9=H |last10=Brazma| first10=A | journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=38 |pmid=19906730 | pmc=2808905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and access==
The original aim of EFO was to describe experimental variables in the EBI's Expression Atlas resource.&lt;ref name=pmid20200009/&gt;&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt; This consisted primarily of disease, anatomical regions and cell types. By December 2013 the scope had grown to include several other EMBL-EBI resources and several external projects including CellFinder,&lt;ref name=cellfinder&gt;{{cite journal | title=CELDA – an ontology for the comprehensive representation of cells in complex systems | pages=228 | volume=14 | journal=BMC Bioinformatics| last1=Seltmann |first1=S. | year=2014 | doi=10.1186/1471-2105-14-228 | pmid=23865855 | pmc=3722091}}&lt;/ref&gt; cell lines from the [[ENCODE]] project and phenotype to SNP information in the [[National Human Genome Research Institute|NHGRI's]] [[Genome-wide association study|Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies]].&lt;ref name=gwascat&gt;{{cite journal |pages=D1001-D1006 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkt1229 |title=The NHGRI GWAS Catalog, a curated resource of SNP-trait associations| year=2014 |last1=Welter |first1=D. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=42 |pmid=24316577 | pmc=3965119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFO makes use of existing biomedical ontologies from the [[Open Biomedical Ontologies]] collection in order to improve interoperability with other resources which may also use these same ontologies, such as [[ChEBI]]&lt;ref name=pmid19854951&gt;{{cite journal |pages=D249–54 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkp886 |title=Chemical Entities of Biological Interest: An update |year=2009 |last1=De Matos |first1=P. |last2=Alcantara |first2=R. |last3=Dekker |first3=A. |last4=Ennis |first4=M. |last5=Hastings |first5=J. |last6=Haug |first6=K. |last7=Spiteri |first7=I. |last8=Turner |first8=S. |last9=Steinbeck |first9=C. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=38 |pmid=19854951 |issue=Database issue |pmc=2808869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ontology for Biomedical Investigations]].

All data in the database is non-proprietary or is derived from a non-proprietary source. It is thus freely accessible and available to anyone. In addition, each data item is fully traceable and explicitly referenced to the original source.

The EFO data is available through a public web interface, BioPortal Web Service hosted at the National Centre for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO)&lt;ref name=BioPortal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ |title= NCBO BioPortal | publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and downloads.

== Early life ==
Mishra was born on 1 June 1915 at [[Jhānjirmangalā]], [[Cuttack]], [[Odisha]] to Bidyādhar Mishra and Subhadrā Mishra.&lt;ref name="McDaniel1990"/&gt;

== Literary career ==
Faturānanda is well known for his distinctly unique and original style of writing. He uses simple and colloquial language with a natural flow. Underlying theme in all his works is social issues addressed either directly or indirectly.

According to Faturānanda “Stories I wrote initially were of tragic nature. After publication of “Dagaro” from Cuttack I started noticing the comic and humorous stories in it. Those were more or less of the same plot. For example, romance between a college boy and a college girl. Both decide to get married, but face some obstacle just before it. Finally the end of their romance. After seeing the same situation in all these published stories, I said – can’t there be any humor without these college boys and college girls. I made up my mind then and there not to ever include romance in my humor and satire. I have followed this principle ever since."

'''Hypomnema''' (Greek. ὑπόμνημα,  plural ὑπομνήματα, ''hypomnemata''), also spelled '''hupomnema''', is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word with several translations into English including a reminder, a note, a public record, a commentary, an anecdotal record, a draft, a copy, and other variations on those terms.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23108803  Liddell and Scott Greek-English Lexicon online])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]]'s theory of [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]] recognized the new status of [[writing]] as a device of artificial [[memory]], and he developed the hypomnesic principles for his students to follow in the [[Academy]]. According to Michel Foucault, "The hypomnemata constituted a material memory of things read, heard, or thought, thus offering these as an accumulated treasure for rereading and later [[meditation]].
They also formed a raw material for the writing of more systematic treatises in which were given arguments and means by which to struggle against some defect (such as anger, envy, gossip, flattery) or to overcome some difficult circumstance (a mourning, an exile, downfall, disgrace)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foucault|first1=Michel|title=Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth|date=1997|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage ==
[[Michel Foucault]] uses the word in the sense of "note", but his translators use the word "notebook", which is [[anachronism|anachronistic]] (see [[codex]] and [[wax tablet]]). Concerning [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s discipline of self-knowledge, Foucault writes: "In this period there was a culture of what could be called personal writing: taking notes on the reading, conversations, and reflections that one hears or engages in oneself; keeping kinds of [[notebook]]s on important subjects (what the Greeks call 'hupomnemata'), which must be reread from time to time so as to reactualize their contents."&lt;ref&gt;"The Hermeneutics of the Subject: Lectures at the College de France 1981-1982" Foucault, Michel, Picador, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; In an [http://foucault.info/documents/foucault.hypoMnemata.en.html excerpt from an ''Interview with Michel Foucault'' in ''The Foucault Reader''], he says: "As personal as they were, the hypomnemata must nevertheless not be taken for intimate diaries or for those accounts of spiritual experience (temptations, struggles, falls, and victories) which can be found in later [[Christian]] literature. [... T]heir objective is not to bring the arcana conscientiae to light, the confession of which—be it oral or written—has a purifying value."

'''Irish Sign Language''' ('''ISL''', {{lang-ga|Teanga Chomharthaíochta na hÉireann}}) is the [[sign language]] of [[Ireland]], used primarily in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It is also used in [[Northern Ireland]], alongside [[British Sign Language]] (BSL). Irish Sign Language is more closely related to [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) than to [[British Sign Language|BSL]], though it has influence from both languages. It has influenced sign languages in Australia and South Africa, and has little relation to either spoken [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[English language|English]].

==Development==
The [[Irish Deaf Society]] says that ISL "arose from within deaf communities", "was developed by deaf people themselves" and "has been in existence for hundreds of years". According to [[Ethnologue]], the language has influence from both LSF and BSL, as well as from [[signed French]] and [[signed English]], BSL having been introduced in Dublin in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=isg|title=Irish Sign Language|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first school for deaf children in Ireland was established in 1816 by [[Charles Orpen|Dr. Charles Orpen]]. The Claremont Institute was a [[Protestant]] institution and given that Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom, it is no surprise that BSL (or some version of [[signed English]] based in BSL) was used for teaching and learning (Pollard 2006). McDonnell (1979) reports that the Irish institutions - [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] and Protestant - did not teach the children to speak and it was not until 1887 that Claremont report changing from a manual to an [[oralism|oral approach]]. For the Catholic schools, the shift to oralism came later: St. Mary's School for Deaf Girls moved to an oral approach in 1946 and St. Joseph's School for Deaf Boys shifted to oralism in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;Griffey 1994, Crean 1997&lt;/ref&gt; though this did not become formal state policy until 1972. Sign language use was seriously suppressed and religion was used to further stigmatise the language (e.g. children were encouraged to give up signing for [[Lent]] and sent to [[sacrament of Reconciliation|confession]] if caught signing).&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell and Saunders 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the Catholic schools are segregated on the basis of gender led to the development of a gendered-generational variant of Irish Sign Language that is still evident (albeit to a lesser degree) today.&lt;ref&gt;LeMaster 1990, Leeson and Grehan 2004, Leeson 2005, Leeson and Saeed 2012, Leonard 2005, Grehan 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

ISL was brought by Catholic missionaries to [[Australia]],and to Scotland and England, with remnants of ISL still visible in some variants of BSL, especially in [[Glasgow]], and with some elderly [[Auslan]] Catholics still using ISL today. In South Africa, the Dominican nuns who established Catholic Schools saw a need for a school for the deaf, but due to resource constraints were not in a position to do this immediately. Instead, they wrote back to their Mother House in Cabra requesting an experienced teacher of the deaf. A deaf teacher, Ms. Bridget Lynne, responded. Remnants of gendered generational Irish Sign Language are thought to still be visible in some dialects of South African Sign Language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Irish Sign Language|last=Leeson|first=Lorraine|last2=Saeed|first2=John I.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which can probably be traced back to Ms. Lynne. 

==Oireachtas bill==
The "Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016" passed all stages in the [[Oireachtas]] (Irish Parliament) on 14 December 2017, and was signed into law by the [[President of Ireland]] [[Michael D. Higgins|Michael D Higgins]] on 24 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/irish-sign-language-given-official-legal-recognition-1.3338081|title=Irish Sign Language given official legal recognition|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2017/1224/929482-sign-language-bill/|title=President signs Irish Sign Language bill into law|date=2017-12-24|work=RTE.ie|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill  ensures that public services are available through ISL and also outlines the need for greater access to education through sign language. Prior to the passage, there was no automatic right for deaf people to have an ISL [[Language interpretation|interpreter]] (except for criminal court proceedings). For the deaf community, recognition of ISL means more legal rights and better access to [[Public service|public services]] - including [[Education in the Republic of Ireland|education]], [[Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland|healthcare]], [[Media of the Republic of Ireland|media]] and [[banking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2017/1213/927259-irish-sign-language/|title=Dáil passes 'historic' sign language legislation|date=2017-12-14|work=RTE.ie|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/irish-sign-language-set-to-be-given-official-status-36407921.html|title=Irish Sign Language set to be given official status - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/irish-sign-language-set-to-receive-official-recognition-818648.html|title=Irish sign language set to receive official recognition|date=2017-12-14|work=Breaking News|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kaingang language''' (also spelled '''Kaingáng''') is a [[Gê languages|Gê language]] spoken by the [[Kaingang]] people of southern [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaingang nation has about 30,000 &amp;nbsp;people, and about from 60% to 65% speak the language. Most also speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

The Kaingang and Xokleng were previously considered a single ethnicity, which went by a number of names, including ''Amhó, Dorin, Gualachi, Chiqui, Ingain, Botocudo, Ivitorocái (= Amho), Kamé, Kayurukré, Tain (= Ingain), Taven.'' Some of these may have been tribal names; others were exonyms. Those living along the coast at the time of the Conquest were called ''Guayaná'', and are considered to be the ancestors of the Kaingang.&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopédia dos Povos Indígenas no Brasil - Instituto Socioambiental''&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unknown to what extent the names might have corresponded to dialectal differences.

== Culture ==
The Kaingang language is classified as a member of the ''Ge'' family, the largest language family in the Macro-Ge stock. The Kaingang territory occupies the modern states of [[São Paulo]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (and, until the beginning of the 20th century, [[Misiones Province|Misiones, Argentina]]). Today they live in around 30 indigenous lands (similar to Native American [[Indian reservation|reservations]]), especially at Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná.

In the 1960s, because of a missionary interest (conducted by the [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]] (SIL)), the language was studied by Ursula Wiesemann.&lt;ref name=Wiesemann&gt;&lt;!--

All consonants have varying [[allophone]]s depending on their position in the word and on the adjancency of nasal vowels:
* The [[Oral consonant|oral]] stops have [[Prenasalized stop|prenasalized]] allophones {{IPA|[ᵐp, ⁿt, ᵑk]}} when following a nasal vowel. In unstressed syllables, {{IPA|/k/}} is furthermore voiced to become {{IPA|[ᵑɡ]}}.
* The [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}} and the non-stop consonants are realized as nasalized {{IPA|[ʔ̃, ɸ̃, ç̃, h̃, w̃, ɹ̃, j̃]}} preceding nasal vowels.
* The phonemes {{IPA|/b, d, ɟ, ɡ/}} are only realized as voiced oral stops between two oral vowels. They are realized as voiced prenasalized stops {{IPA|[ᵐb, ⁿd, ᶮɟ, ᵑɡ]}} when between a nasal and an oral vowel, as well as word-initially before oral vowels. Between an oral and a nasal vowel they are conversely realized as [[Prestopped consonant|prestopped]] {{IPA|[ᵇm, ᵈn, ᶡɲ, ᶢŋ]}}. Between two nasal vowels, or word-initially before nasal vowels, they are realized as full nasal stops: {{IPA|[m, n, ɲ, ŋ]}}. The first two types of realization also apply when occurring in the syllable coda and followed by a non-nasal segment; these voiced/prenasalized will however be additionally [[Unreleased stop|unreleased]]: {{IPA|[⁽ᵐ⁾b˺, ⁽ⁿ⁾d˺, ⁽ᶮ⁾ɟ˺, ⁽ᵑ⁾ɡ˺]}}. However, by convention these stop-phonemes are always written as &lt;m, n, nh, g&gt; in the orthography.
* When preceded by an oral vowel, the sequences {{IPA|/nt, ɲt, ŋk/}} can be realized as geminate stops: {{IPA|[tː, cː, kː]}}.
* {{IPA|/ŋ/}} is optionally labialized:  {{IPA|[ɡʷ, ŋʷ]}}, etc.
* The non-glottal fricatives can word-initially be [[Free variation|optionally]] realized as affricates {{IPA|[p͡ɸ, c͡ç]}} (including their nasal allophones: {{IPA|[p͡ɸ̃, c͡ç̃]}}.)
* {{IPA|/w/}} can optionally be realized as a voiced bilabial fricative {{IPA|[β]}}, and {{IPA|/j/}} as a voiced palatal stop {{IPA|[ɟ]}}.  When nasalized, {{IPA|/j/}} varies between {{IPA|[j̃]}} and {{IPA|[ɲ]}}. 
* Word-initially, {{IPA|/ɹ/}} is preceded by an epenthetic {{IPA|[ə]}}; it is {{IPA|[ɾ]}} in tonic syllables and {{IPA|[l]}} in atonic syllables, and when nasalized, it varies between {{IPA|[ɾ̃]}} and {{IPA|[ɹ̃]}}. As a syllable coda it is a flap when oral and approximant when nasal, and may optionally be palatalized: {{IPA|[ɾʲ], [ɹ̃ᶮ]}}. 
* Word-initially in a stressed syllable, {{IPA|/t/}} may vary in realization between [[dental consonant|dental]] {{IPA|[t̪]}} and [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] {{IPA|[t]}}. Following palatal consonants or preceding a close vowel, it can also realized as a palatal stop, {{IPA|[c]}}.

== Orthography ==

Wiesemann proposed an alphabet for the language, which is still in use despite some problems.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It is based on the [[Latin script]], and consists of fourteen consonants and fourteen vowels, matching the fourteen consonants and fourteen vowels of the Kaingang language.

There are dictionaries and grammars available for Kaingang. A school was set up in 1969 to teach the Kaingang people to read and write their language. However, the school produced many Kaingang speakers who went back to their reservations to teach others and spread the writing innovations they learned. Only one of the dialects is used as the standard written form, though having the writing system provided a source of pride in the language for the Kaingang people. A Kaingang bible has been published, as well as a dictionary and other publications.

Examples of Kaingang writing can be found on [http://www.omniglot.com/writing/kaingang.php Omniglot].

'''''Lau v. Nichols''''', 414 U.S. 563 (1974), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court unanimously decided that the lack of supplemental language instruction in public school for students with [[limited English proficiency]] violated the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The court held that since non-English speakers were denied a meaningful education, the [[disparate impact]] caused by the school policy violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the school district was demanded to provide students with "appropriate relief".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ussc|name=Lau v. Nichols|volume=414|page=563|pin=|year=1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1971, the San Francisco school system desegregated based on the result of Supreme Court case ''[[Guey Heung Lee v. Johnson|Lee v. Johnson]].'' 2856 Chinese students, who were not fluent in English, were integrated back into the [[San Francisco Unified School District]] (SFUSD). Only about 1000 of those students were provided supplemental English instruction. Of the other 1800-plus Chinese students who weren't fluent in English, many were placed in special education classes while some were forced to be in the same grade for years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Even though the [[Bilingual Education Act]] was passed by Congress in 1968 to address the needs of Limited English Speaking Abilities students, the funding was limited.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Punches|first=Michael W.|date=1985-01-01|title=The Shaping of a Social Policy: The Bilingual Education Act, 1968-1984|jstor=42589123|journal=Journal of Thought|volume=20|issue=4|pages=62–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; School participation in those programs was also voluntary, and by 1972, "only 100,391 students nationally, out of approximately 5,000,000 in need were enrolled in a [[Title VII]]-funded program."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrzela|first=Natalia M|year=2010|title=Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California|url=|journal=Peabody Journal of Education|volume=85|pages=414|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward H. Steinman, a public-interest lawyer, reached out to the parents of Kinney Kinmon Lau and other Chinese students with limited English proficiency. He encouraged them to challenge the school district, and they filed a class action suit against [[Alan Nichols|Alan H. Nichols]], the president of the SFUSD at the time, and other officials in the school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1984/01/25/05300020.h03.html|title=Languages, Law, and San Francisco - Education Week|date=1984-01-25|newspaper=Education Week|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students claimed that they were not receiving special help in school due to their inability to speak English, and they argued they were entitled to special help under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] because of equal protection and the ban on educational discrimination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|District Court for the Northern District of California]] denied the relief and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] affirmed the decision. The District Court argued that since a uniform policy was used for all students in SFUSD and that the district didn't intentionally discriminate against students with limited English proficiency, equal protection was provided and the Fourteenth Amendment was not violated. The Court of Appeals claimed that since the school district provided the same treatment for all students, even though some students were disadvantaged due to their limited fluency in English, the school district was not required to make up for the different starting points of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugarman|first=Stephen D.|last2=Widess|first2=Ellen G.|date=1974-01-01|title=Equal Protection for Non-English-Speaking School Children: Lau v. Nichols|jstor=3479823|journal=California Law Review|volume=62|issue=1|pages=157–182|doi=10.2307/3479823}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students appealed the Court of Appeal's decision to the Supreme Court.

== Decision of the Supreme Court ==
[[File:Justice_Blackmun_Official.jpg|left|thumb|245x245px|Justice Harry Blackmun, who concurred with the decision and stated that the number of students affected in this case was substantial enough to deem affirmative remedies necessary.]]

The Supreme Court issued its decision on January 21, 1974, with the Court unanimously ruling in favor of Lau. Instead of examining the equal protection clause from the 14th Amendment, the Court relied on Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Since the school system received federal funding, it was required to provide equal opportunities and access to all students. The Court claimed that even though the school districts provided equal treatment for all students, it still imposed disparate impact on the non-English speaking students since they were not able to understand the class material as effectively as other students and therefore were deprived of having "meaningful" education. The Court also referenced the guideline established by [[Office for Civil Rights|the Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR) of [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|the Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] in 1970, which stated that language could be used as a proxy of discrimination on national origin and that "the district must take affirmative steps to rectify the language deficiency in order to open its instructional program to these students."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/lau1970.html|title=DHEW Memo Regarding Language Minority Children|date=2015-10-15|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court demanded the school district to make necessary changes to provide equal education to the non-English speakers, but it didn't state any specific remedies for the district to follow.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Justice [[Potter Stewart]], joined by Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger|Burger]] and Justice [[Harry Blackmun|Blackmun]], concurred with this decision as he stated that affirmative remedial efforts, suggested by the OCR, were constitutional and appropriate in this case as long as the efforts were "reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation." In his concurrence joined by Chief Justice Burger, Justice Blackmun also suggested that "numbers are at the heart of this case" and that if the case only involved a few students, rather than nearly 2,000, the decision would not be the same.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
Lau remains an important decision in bilingual education history. In this case, the Supreme Court found the violation of Civil Rights Act of 1964 based on the discriminatory effect of the school policy regardless of the intent of the officials. It prohibited the "sink and swim" policy and set a precedent of finding disparate impact in violation of the Civil Rights Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moran|first=Rachel F.|year=2005|title=Undone by Law: The Uncertain Legacy of Lau v. Nichols|url=|journal=Berkeley La Raza Law Journal|volume=16|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was subsequently followed by the passing of [[Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974]] in Congress, which specifically prohibited discrimination against faculty and student in public schools and required the school districts to take "appropriate action" to overcome the barriers to equal participation of all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3776#axzz1pm57fScr|title=Richard Nixon: Special Message to the Congress on Equal Educational Opportunities and School Busing.|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It increased funding to the Bilingual Education Act and made additional English instruction mandatory, which effectively extended the Lau ruling to all public schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Officer for Civil Rights then developed a remedial guideline in 1975, otherwise known as the Lau Remedies, that specified methods and approaches for the school districts to follow in order to provide a meaningful education to students with limited English proficiency. This led to the development of bilingual programs and additional English instructions in most public schools.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Health, Education and Welfare Department. ''Task Force Findings Specifying Remedies Available for Eliminating past Educational Practices Ruled Unlawful under LAU v. NICHOLS''. N.p.: n.p., 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have been challenges to the Lau decision in recent decades. In the Supreme Court case ''[[Alexander v. Sandoval]]'', [[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 532|532]] [[United States Reports|U.S.]] 275 (2001), the Court claimed that private plaintiffs did not have the right of action to sue against disparate impact violation under Title VI and they must provide proofs of intentional discrimination. It implied that students can no longer sue schools for policies that cause disparate impact, which significantly weakened the foundation of the Lau decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenbaum|first=Sara|date=2004-01-01|title=Reducing Discrimination Affecting Persons with Limited English Proficiency: Federal Civil Rights Guidelines under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act|jstor=20056643|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=119|issue=1|pages=93–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70807">The '''grammar of Lojban''' is based on [[predicate logic]]. The majority of the grammar is borrowed from the prior "logical language" [[Loglan]], and some of its features come from [[Láadan]]. The characteristic regularity, unambiguity, and versatility of [[Lojban]] grammar owes much to modern [[linguistics]] and [[computer programming]]—resources that were unavailable to the designers of earlier languages. Lojbanist Bob LeChevalier summarized one advantage of Lojban grammar as follows: "Lojban moves beyond the restrictions of European grammar. It overtly incorporates [[linguistic universal]]s, building in what is needed to support the expressivity of the whole variety of natural languages, including non-European ones."&lt;ref&gt;LeChevalier, Bob. [http://www.lojban.org/files/why-lojban/lojb_esp.txt ''On Comparing Esperanto and Lojban''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal grammars==
Lojban texts can be [[Parsing|parsed]] just as texts in programming languages are by using formal grammars such as [[Parsing Expression Grammar|PEG]], [[YACC]], [[Backus–Naur form]].{{sfn|Cowan|2016|loc=section 21.1}} There are several parsers available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Official_LLG_Parser|title=Official LLG Parser - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/camxes|title=camxes - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/ilmentufa|title=la ilmentufa - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Lojban has 6 [[vowel]]s and 21 [[consonant]]s. The [[phoneme]]s are commensurate with [[grapheme]]s, which means Lojban has 27 letters (''lerfu'') each corresponding to a unique phoneme. Lojbanic graphemes can vary in mode; this article employs the [[Latin alphabet]] version, which is currently in the most common usage (see Orthography for more detail). The phonemes, on the other hand, are defined solely according to the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

The tables below show typical realizations of sounds and the Latin alphabets in Lojban. In all cases except the rhotic consonant the first phoneme represents the preferred pronunciation, while the rest are the permitted variants intended to cover dissimilitude in pronunciation by speakers of different linguistic backgrounds.

===Diphthongs===
Lojban has 16 [[diphthong]]s (a kind of sound which consists of a vowel plus a [[Semivowel|glide]], always constituting a single syllable).
The combinations &lt;ai&gt;, &lt;au&gt;, &lt;ei&gt; and &lt;oi&gt;, for instance, are all realized as the corresponding [[falling diphthong]]s. [[Triphthong]]s exist as combinations of a rising and a falling diphthong, e.g. &lt;iau&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Allophones===
The [[vowel]]s can be either [[roundedness|rounded or unrounded]]. The consonants can be either [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated or unaspirated]], although the voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are usually aspirated to some degree. In general, consonants are not [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]. The [[affricate]]s /[[d͡ʒ]]/, /[[t͡ʃ]]/, /[[d͡z]]/, and /[[t͡s]]/ occur in Lojban. (Respectively, these are the sounds highlighted in the English words '''''j'''ar'', '''''ch'''air'', ''fa'''ds''''', and ''ca'''ts'''''.) However, each is considered to be a combination of an appropriate stop and fricative [[phoneme]]: the sequences &lt;dj&gt;, &lt;tc&gt;, &lt;dz&gt; and &lt;ts&gt;, respectively. The rhotic sounds are all equally acceptable as an identical phoneme.{{sfn|Cowan|2016|loc=section 3.2}} &lt;l&gt;, &lt;m&gt;, &lt;n&gt;, and &lt;r&gt; may be syllabic.{{sfn|Cowan|2016|loc=section 3.4}}

===Buffering of consonant clusters===
For those who, given their native language background, may have trouble pronouncing (certain) [[consonant cluster]]s, there is the option of inserting buffer vowels between them, as long as they differ sufficiently from the phonological vowels and are pronounced as short as possible. This mechanism can be described as a form of  anaptyxis (vocalic [[epenthesis]]). Possible choices include {{IPAblink|ɪ}} , {{IPAblink|ɨ}}, {{IPAblink|ʊ}} and {{IPAblink|ʏ}} (but not {{IPAblink|y}}, which is the rounded counterpart of {{IPA|[i]}} and thus a valid realization of {{IPA|/i/}}). The resulting added syllables are completely ignored by the grammar, including for the purposes of stress determination.

==Orthography==
Lojban may be written in different orthography systems as long as it meets the required regularities and unambiguities. Some of the reasons for such elasticity would be as follows:
# Lojban is rather defined by the phonemes (spoken form of words), therefore, as long as they are correctly rendered so as to maintain the Lojbanic audio-visual [[isomorphism]], a representational system can be said to be an appropriate orthography of the language;
# Lojban is meant to be as culturally neutral as possible, so it is never crucial or fundamental to claim that some particular orthography of some particular languages (e.g. the Latin alphabet) should be the dominant mode.

Lojbanist Kena extends this principle to argue that even an original orthography of the language is to be sought.&lt;ref&gt;Kena. [http://vodka-pomme.net/projects/tengwar-for-lojban/write#lojban ''Vodka-Pomme: Considerations on writing: The case of lojban''] (accessed August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- It is suggested that the Lojban term 'lerfu' be used here instead of the English word 'letter' so that confusion with the type of letter one writes to someone is avoided. James Cooke Brown's version was ''letteral'', by analogy with ''numeral'' (see section 17.1 of "The Complete Lojban Language" by Cowan).--&gt;
===Latin/Roman mode===
Lojban's Latin alphabet consists of 23 lerfu ''a b c d e f g i j k l m n o p r s t u v x y z'' plus 3 semi-lerfu ''&amp;#39; , . ''. They are intentionally ordered in accordance with that of [[ASCII|ASCII characters]].

Capitalization may be applied to mark a non-standard [[stress (linguistics)|stressed syllable]] as in cmevla, but they are not considered separate lerfu. Whether a single vowel or the entire syllable is capitalized is a matter of preference; for example, the name "Josephine" can be rendered as either {{lang|jbo|DJOzefin.}} or {{lang|jbo|djOzefin.}} (without the capitalization, the ordinary rules of Lojban stress will cause the 'ze' syllable to be stressed instead).

[[Punctuation|Punctuation marks]] are not mandatory; such notions as question or exclamation are expressed with words rather than unpronounced symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Nick; Cowan, John Woldemar. ''What is Lojban?''. Fairfax, Virginia: The Logical Language Group, 2003. {{ISBN|0-9660283-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyrillic mode===
This mode was conceived when the introductory Lojban brochure was translated into Russian. 23 lerfu ''а б в г д е ж з и к л м н о п р с т у ф х ш ъ'' plus 3 semi-lerfu ''&amp;#39;, . '' are used. The hard sign ''ъ'' is assigned to the open-mid vowel. Diphthongs are written as vowel pairs, as in the Roman mode.{{sfn|Cowan|2016|loc=section 3.12|ps=: "Oddball Orthographies".}}

===Tengwar mode===
Kena&lt;ref&gt;Kena. [http://vodka-pomme.net/projects/tengwar-for-lojban/lojteng#learn ''Lojban using tengwar - why?''] (accessed August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; argues for writing Lojban using [[Tengwar]], arguing that:
# the Latin alphabet is too strongly related to Western civilizations, and thus probably introduces some kind of cultural bias in Lojban. Lojban wants to be both logical and culturally neutral, the Tengwar already are;
# the Tengwar system inherently contains some main Lojban morphology rules, making Lojban easier to learn when it is written with Tengwar.

Advocates of this mode include [[Eric S. Raymond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/tengwar/lojban-tengwar.html|title=la tenguar: A romantic orthography for Lojban|website=www.catb.org|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese mode===
A [[hiragana|Japanese hiragana]] version of Lojban orthography has been proposed, in which case more than 80 lerfu may be used. This mode is not without certain technical issues since the hiragana (and katakana too) are always [[syllabary|syllabic]], indicating an open syllable (with the exception of the final "n" sound), requiring some special attention when representing the Lojbanic consonant clusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fa-kuan.muc.de/HIRAGANA.RXML|title=Lojban Hiragana|website=www.fa-kuan.muc.de|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several example [[haiku]] compositions in the orthography have been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fa-kuan.muc.de/HAIKU.RXML|title=Lojban Haikus|website=www.fa-kuan.muc.de|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fa-kuan.muc.de/HAIKU2.RXML|title=2001nan. pi'esopi'epapa|website=www.fa-kuan.muc.de|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
{{Expand section|date=August 2007}}

Lojban has 3 [[parts of speech|word-classes]]: ''brivla'' (verbs or predicate words), ''cmavo'' (structure words), and ''cmevla'' (name words). Each of them has uniquely identifying morphological properties, so that one can unambiguously recognize which word is of which part of speech in a string of the language. They may be further divided in sub-classes (discussed respectively below).{{sfn|Cowan|2016|loc=section 4.1}}

There also exist affixes (''rafsi'') assigned to some of the brivla and cmavo.{{sfn|Cowan|2016|loc=section 4.4}}&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Nick, and John Cowan. [http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/morphol.html  ''What is Lojban?: 2.2''] (accessed August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===brivla – verbs===
''brivla'' carry the content (semantic information) of an expression. The bare brivla corresponds to the [[verb]] in English. Additional words can be used to transform it into what corresponds to English [[common noun]]s, [[adjective]]s, or [[adverb]]s{{sfn|Cowan|2016|loc=section 4.3}} (although some modal cmavo too may have adverbial purposes&lt;ref&gt;Logical Language Group, The. [http://www.lojban.org/publications/brochures/lojex.txt ''Diagrammed Summary of Lojban Grammar Forms with Example Sentences IV.B''] (accessed August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;). Brivla may be identified by the following morphological properties:&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Nick, and John Cowan. [http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/morphol.html ''What is Lojban?: 2.2''] (accessed August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Have more than one syllable
*Are penultimately stressed
*Have a consonant cluster (at least two adjacent consonants) in the first 5 lerfu including the second consonant
*Start with a consonant (except some fu'ivla)
*End with a vowel
A word such as {{lang|jbo|lobypei}} will still be considered as a brivla because the special gluing vowel ''y'' between ''b'' and ''p'' is to be ignored and therefore a consonant cluster (''b-p'') assumes its existence within it.

Unlike verbs in English, brivla do not inflect for tense, person, or number.

Brivla's sub-classes are as follows, with some examples.

====gismu – core verbs====
The brivla which constitute the lexical core of the language are called ''gismu''. They are invariably five-letter words, which distinguishes it from the other types of brivla, and are in a form of either CVCCV or CCVCV (C stands for a consonant and V for a vowel). Being two syllables means that the general rule of gismu to be stressed penultimately will always cause the first syllable to be stressed.
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''''viska''''' (CVCCV)

:'''''prami''''' (CCVCV)
&lt;/div&gt;

They have been chosen or added as root words because they 
* represent concepts that are very familiar and basic,
* represent concepts the usage of which is equally frequent among different languages,
* would be helpful in constructing more complex words, or
* represent fundamental grammatical concepts of Lojban&lt;!-- like ''cmavo'' and ''gismu''--&gt;.{{sfn|Cowan|2016|loc=section 4.4}}
The main source languages from which they were drawn are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Here is further explanation of the nature of gismu by Cowan:

:{{quotation|The gismu do not represent any sort of systematic partitioning of semantic space. Some gismu may be superfluous, or appear for historical reasons: the gismu list was being collected for almost 35 years and was only weeded out once. Instead, the intention is that the gismu blanket semantic space: they make it possible to talk about the entire range of human concerns. [...] For a given concept, words in the six languages that represent that concept were written in Lojban phonetics. Then a gismu was selected to maximize the recognizability of the Lojban word for speakers of the six languages by weighting the inclusion of the sounds drawn from each language by the number of speakers of that language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''The Complete Lojban Language: 4.4''}}

According to Robin Turner,&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Robin. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120411000018/http://neptune.spaceports.com/~words/lojban.html ''Lojban - a logical language''] (archived version, April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; the creation was algorithmically done by computer.

Approximately 1350 gismu exist, which is a relatively small number when compared to that of English words ranging from 450,000 up to 1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;Ling, Johnny. [http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/JohnnyLing.shtml ''Number of Words in the English Language'']. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, by learning only these root words, as well as their fragmental forms and some major structure words (cmavo), one will be able to communicate effectively in Lojban.

====lujvo – verbs made of affixes====
The form of brivla made of affixes (''rafsi'') is called ''lujvo''.
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''{{lang|jbo|pazvau}}''' – pregnant ({{lang|jbo|paz}} (an affix from {{lang|jbo|panzi}}, offspring) + {{lang|jbo|vau}} (an affix from {{lang|jbo|vasru}}, containing))

:'''{{lang|jbo|bavlamdei}}''' – tomorrow ({{lang|jbo|bav}} (from {{lang|jbo|balvi}}, future) + {{lang|jbo|lam}} (from {{lang|jbo|lamji}}, adjacent) + {{lang|jbo|dei}} (from {{lang|jbo|djedi}}, a day in duration))

:'''{{lang|jbo|seljgi}}''' – object of pride ({{lang|jbo|sel}} (an affix from the particle {{lang|jbo|se}}) + {{lang|jbo|jgi}} (an affix from {{lang|jbo|jgira}}, pride))
&lt;/div&gt;

====fu'ivla – borrowed verbs, loan words====
''fu'ivla'' usually refers to things that are culture-specific (including Lojban culture) or to kinds of plants or animals, concepts which cannot be easily expressed as mere modifying-modified combinations of Lojban's internal root verbs (''gismu'').

fu'ivla can be subdivided into four types according to the extent to which they are modified, namely Stage 1, 2, 3, and 4 fu'ivla.

=====Stage 1 fu'ivla=====
The longest form, quoting a foreign word/phrase while preserving its original spelling with particular structure words.
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:{{lang|jbo|me la'o ly. '''spaghetti''' ly.}}&lt;br&gt;({{lang|jbo|la'o}} indicates that a non-lojbanic text follows. {{lang|jbo|ly.}} are delimiters of that foreign text. And {{lang|jbo|me}} turns the whole sequence into a selbri so that the word/phrase can form a bridi with its given place structure. In this example, "x1 is a quantity of spaghetti" is a possible place structure.)
&lt;/div&gt;
*It should be noted that a "hybrid" stage sometimes is enlisted. In this case, it would take the above sentence but Lojbanize "spaghetti" to be phonetic to a (native) Lojban without changing the ending. Therefore, stage "1.5" fu'ivla for "''spaghetti''" is "{{lang|jbo|me la'o ly. '''spageti''' ly.}}"

=====Stage 2 fu'ivla=====
This stage involves lojbanizing the sound and spelling of the word.
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;{{lang|jbo|me la '''.spagetis.'''}}&lt;br&gt;({{lang|jbo|me}} is still needed since {{lang|jbo|la spagetis.}} cannot by itself work as a brivla.)&lt;/span&gt;

=====Stage 3 fu'ivla=====
At this stage a borrowed word is fully turned into a single brivla, having its own place structure. Since no brivla may have more than one meaning, it is often the case that they are attached by a rafsi (with a hyphen like "-r-", "-n-", or "-l-") categorizing or limiting the semantic scope of the word (such are called "rafsi classifier"). Again they always start with a consonant and end with a vowel.
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''{{lang|jbo|cidjrspageti}}''' (using longer rafsi: cidj + r + "spaghetti", using {{lang|jbo|cidja}}, food)

:'''{{lang|jbo|djarspageti}}''' (using shorter rafsi: dja + r + "spaghetti", using a rafsi of {{lang|jbo|cidja}})

:'''{{lang|jbo|zgikrtekno}}''' ({{lang|jbo|zgike}} (music) + "techno")

:'''{{lang|jbo|runrxorigami}}''' ({{lang|jbo|rutni}} (artifact) + "origami")
&lt;/div&gt;

=====Stage 4 fu'ivla=====
These are the borrowings which are so common or so important that have become as short as possible, having no rafsi classifier. Unlike other brivla, they may begin with a vowel (preceded by a pause mark separating it from the previous word). Also the word must not be of a form that one can remove all the initial vowels (and apostrophes) and have a valid word.
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''{{lang|jbo|skalduna}}''' ("Basque" from "{{lang|eu|euskaldun}}")
:'''{{lang|jbo|frangula}}''' ("buckthorn" from a species name)
:'''{{lang|jbo|vombatu}}''' ("wombat")
:'''{{lang|jbo|.alba'aka}}''' ("basil" from Spanish)
&lt;/div&gt;

====lujvo with components made of fu'ivla====
It is possible to absorb a fu'ivla into a lujvo, with principles varying among Lojbanists. Notable proponents are Pierre Abbat and Jorge Llambías. Here are some comparisons of their methods drawn from the Lojban mailing list (as of July 2007):
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:{{lang|jbo|me'andi}} ([[henna]], from [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] {{transl|gu|mehandi}}) + {{lang|jbo|skari}} (colour)&lt;br&gt;'''{{lang|jbo|me'andyska}}''' (Abbat)&lt;br&gt;'''{{lang|jbo|me'andi'yska}}''' (Llambías)

:{{lang|jbo|gurnrtefi}} ([[teff]]) + ''nanba'' (bread)&lt;br&gt;'''{{lang|jbo|gurnrtefynanba}}''' (Abbat)&lt;br&gt;'''{{lang|jbo|gurnrtefi'ynanba}}''' (Llambías)

:{{lang|jbo|mikri}} (one millionth, [[micro-]]) + {{lang|jbo|enri}} ([[henry (unit)|henry]])&lt;br&gt;'''{{lang|jbo|miky'enri}}''' (Abbat)&lt;br&gt;'''{{lang|jbo|miky'enri}}''' (Llambías)
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!--====tanru – compound verbs====--&gt;

===cmavo – particles, structure words===
Lojban particles, ''cmavo'', are recognized by following morphological properties:
*may be a single syllable
*never contain a consonant cluster of any type, whether or not y is counted
*end in a vowel
*need not be penultimately stressed, though they often are if they have more than one syllable
And they display one of the following letter patterns: V, VV, V'V, CV, CVV, CV'V. The form generally does not indicate anything about its grammatical function.

cmavo can be sequenced without spaces and without any change to its meaning:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''pa re ci'' (123) = '''''pareci''''' (123)

:''se pi'o'' (using ...) = '''''sepi'o''''' (using ...)
&lt;/div&gt;
As far as the stress rules of Lojban are concerned, such compound cmavo are still separate words, so penultimate stress (e.g. ''paREci'') is not obligatory.

Some cmavo have rafsi, which may help converting tanru (sequence of brivla) into lujvo:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''''ve''' detri'' --&gt; '''''vel'''detri'' ("calendar", from fourth slot of ''detri'', date'')

:'''''se ke''' cpacu djica'' --&gt; '''''selkem'''cpadji'' (roughly "what someone wants to get", from ''cpacu'', get, and ''djica'', desire)
&lt;/div&gt;

===cmevla – name words===
cmevla are mostly used for names of things (including people) in descriptions or in direct address (cf. [[proper nouns]]). They can be in any form as long as they end in a consonant. The practice by which names in natural languages are modified to be used in Lojban is known as "lojbanization".
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;''la '''.bionses.nolz.''''', (a possible realization of the name "Beyoncé Knowles")&lt;/span&gt;

===rafsi – affixes (suffixes, infixes, prefixes)===
A special building block, from which a new lujvo may be created, is called ''rafsi''. Rafsi are bound to certain gismu, cmavo or fu'ivla. This also means that lujvo have no rafsi form of their own. Rafsi cannot by themselves function as an individual words; they only form lujvo when at least two are joined together.
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;

:''solri'' (original gismu for "sun"): '''''sol''''', '''''solr''''', '''''solri''''' (assigned rafsi): '''''sol'''xrula'' (derivative lujvo, "sunflower")

:''ke'' (original cmavo): '''''kem''''' (assigned rafsi): ''sel'''kem'''cpadji'' (derivative lujvo, "what someone wants to get")

:'''''sam''''', '''''pli''''' (component rafsi, from ''skami'' (computer) and ''pilno'' (use) respectively): '''''sampli''''' (derivative lujvo, "computer user")
&lt;/div&gt;

The unambiguity of Lojban morphology, according to John Woldemar Cowan, gives rise to "significant clues to the meaning and the origin of the word, even if you have never heard the word before". He further says: "The same principle allows you, when speaking or writing, to invent new brivla for new concepts 'on the fly'; yet it offers people that you are trying to communicate with a good chance to figure out your meaning. In this way, Lojban has a flexible vocabulary which can be expanded indefinitely."

==Syntax and semantics==

According to ''What Is Lojban?'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Nick. John Cowan. [http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/grammar.html ''What Is Lojban? II.3'']&lt;/ref&gt; the language's grammatical structures are "defined by a set of rules that have been tested to be unambiguous using computers", which is called the "machine grammar". Hence the characteristics of the standard syntactic (not semantic) constructs in Lojban:

* each word has exactly one grammatical interpretation;
* the words relate grammatically to each other in exactly one way.

Such standards, however, are to be attained with certain carefulness:

{{quotation|
It is important to note that new Lojbanists will not be able to speak 'perfectly' when first learning Lojban. In fact, you may never speak perfectly in 'natural' Lojban conversation, even though you achieve fluency in the language. No English speaker always speaks textbook English in natural conversation; Lojban speakers will also make grammatical errors when talking quickly. Lojbanists will, however, be able to speak or write unambiguously if they are careful, which is difficult if not impossible with a natural language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick Nicholas and John Cowan. [http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/grammar.html ''What Is Lojban? II.3'']}}

The computer-tested, unambiguous rules also include grammar for 'incomplete' sentences e.g. for narrative, quotational, or mathematical phrases.

Lojbanic expressions are modular; smaller constructs of words are assembled into larger phrases so that all incorporating pieces manifest as a possible grammatical unity. This mechanism allows for simplistic yet infinitely powerful phrasings; "a more complex phrase can be placed inside a simple structure, which in turn can be used in another instance of the complex phrase structure".

===bridi – clauses, predications===
Being derived from predicate logic, the basic unit of Lojban expression is [[Predicate (grammar)|predication]], a claim that some objects stand in some relationship, or that some single object has some property. In Lojban they are expressed using [[clause]]s (''bridi''). Just as a predication is formed by a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] and [[arguments]] in formal logic, bridi are formed by ''selbri'' and ''sumti'' in Lojban. In linguistic terms ''selbri'' is the predicate of a clause, and ''sumti'' are its arguments. A construct of selbri and sumti produces a claim that something stands in a specified relationship to something else or has a specified property.
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''''do''' | '''viska''' | '''mi'''''&lt;br&gt;(Two sumti and one selbri, making up one bridi, claiming that a relation ''viska'' (x1 sees x2) exists between ''do'' (you) and ''mi'' (me). The selbri needs not be literally between sumti. The example can also be rendered as ''do mi viska''. A more detailed discussion on Lojban word order below.)
&lt;/div&gt;

Multiple bridi can be either sequenced across multiple sentences or compounded in one sentence:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''do | melbi | '''.i''' | do | xendo''&lt;br&gt;You are beautiful. You are kind.&lt;br&gt;(Two sentences, each consisting of one sumti and one selbri. ''.i'' separates sentences.)

:''do | melbi | '''.ije''' | do | xendo''&lt;br&gt;You are beautiful '''and''' you are kind.&lt;br&gt;(This sentence is syntactically identical to the last one but differs in meaning. ''.ije'' may be spelled as ''.i je''.)

:''do | melbi | '''gi'e''' | xendo''&lt;br&gt;You are beautiful '''and''' kind.&lt;br&gt;(One sentence, consisting of one sumti and two selbri. ''gi'e'' separates bridi as well as compounding them.)

:''do | melbi | '''gi'e''' | xendo | '''.iki'ubo''' | mi | nelci | do''&lt;br&gt;You are beautiful '''and''' kind. '''Because of that''', I am fond of you.&lt;br&gt;(Two sentences, one of which includes compound bridi. While ''.i'' simply marks a division of sentences, ''ki'u'' together with ''bo'' adds that there is a particular logical connection between the first and second sentence. ''.iki'ubo'' may be spelled as ''.i ki'u bo''.)
&lt;/div&gt;

A compound bridi can include multiple tenses and sumti:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''mi | '''puze'u''' gunka | gi'e | '''ca''' tatpi''&lt;br&gt;''I | '''for a long interval some time in the past''', worked | and | '''now''', am tired''&lt;br&gt;I worked (for a long time) and I'm now tired.

:''mi | '''ca'o''' klama | ta | ti | fu le karce | gi'e | '''ba''' tavla | do | la .lojban.''&lt;br&gt;I | '''continuing/during''', come | (to) there | (from) here | using the car | and | '''after''', talk | (to) you&lt;br&gt;I'll keep driving the car from here to there, and I will talk to you after.
&lt;/div&gt;

The implicit grammatical divisions can be made explicit by separator words such as ''cu'' and ''vau'', which are often elidable but sometimes need to be present to avoid ambiguity:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''le nixli '''cu''' melbi''&lt;br&gt;(This instance shows that the left-hand gismu is sumti ("the girl") and the right-hand gismu is selbri ("is beautiful"). Without ''cu'' the two gismu would be grammatically undistinguishable.)

:''mi dunda le cukta gi'e lebna lo rupnu '''vau''' do''&lt;br&gt;(''vau'' indicates that the two bridi, ''dunda le cukta'' ("give the book (to)") and ''lebna lo rupnu'' ("take the dollars (from)"), sharing the same first sumti ''mi'', together terminate at that position, enabling them to have the subsequent ''do'' as their mutual second sumti. Compare it with its longer equivalent: ''mi dunda le cukta do .ije mi lebna lo rupnu do'' ("I give the book to you and take the money from you").)
&lt;/div&gt;

The places of ''cu'' and ''vau'' in the previous examples can be rendered as follows:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''do (cu) viska le nixli (vau)''

:''do (cu) melbi (vau) .i do (cu) xendo (vau)''

:''do (cu) melbi (vau) gi'e xendo (vau) (vau)''&lt;br&gt;(The last ''vau'' marks the mutual termination of the two bridi.)

:''do (cu) melbi (vau) gi'e xendo (vau) (vau) .i do (cu) xendo (vau)''
&lt;/div&gt;

The ordered sets of sumti assigned to every selbri are known as "place structures". They are explicitly defined in dictionaries or word lists.
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;''mi | tavla | do | la .lojban. | le glibau''&lt;br&gt;(Two sumti ''mi'' and ''do'' are fitting into the place structure of the selbri ''tavla'', which is '''"x1 talks/speaks to x2 about subject x3 in language x4"'''.)&lt;/span&gt;

Some lujvo formations usually operate on the place structure in predictable ways. The rafsi ''gau'', for instance, inserts one place for the agent and pushes all others down one. Thus brivla can have indefinitely many places. This contrasts with the [[Nominative–accusative language|accusative alignment]] or [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative alignment]] that most languages have, in which there is a small number of named places (subject, direct object, indirect object) and all others are expressed by prepositions.

The [[Linguistic typology|typology]] of Lojban is basically [[subject–verb–object]], with [[subject–object–verb]] also common. However, it can practically be anything. All the following sentences mean "I love you", differing only in word order:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''''mi | prami | do''''' (SVO)
:'''''mi | do | prami''''' (SOV)
:'''''do''' | se '''prami | mi''''' (OVS)
:'''''do | mi''' | se '''prami''''' (OSV)
:'''''prami''' | fa '''mi | do''''' (VSO)
:'''''prami''' | fe '''do''' | fa '''mi''''' (VOS)
&lt;/div&gt;
Such flexibility has to do with the language's intended capability to translate as many expressions of natural languages as possible, based on a unique positional case system. The meaning of the sentence ''mi prami do'' is determined by ''prami'' realizing, with its own predefined place structure, a specific semantic relation between ''mi'' and ''do''; when the positional relation between ''mi'' and ''do'' changes, the meaning of the sentence changes too. As shown above, Lojban has particular devices to preserve such semantic structure of words while altering their order. Compare the followings:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''mi | tavla | do | la .lojban. | le glibau'' ( 1 | selbri | 2 | 3 | 4 )&lt;br&gt;"x1 (''mi'', I) talks/speaks to x2 (''do'', you) about subject x3 (''la lojban.'', Lojban) in language x4 (''le glibau'', English)"

:''do | '''se''' tavla | mi | '''fo''' le glibau | '''fi''' la .lojban.'' ( 2 | selbri | 1 | 4 | 3 )&lt;br&gt;"x2 (''do'') is talked/spoken to by x1 (''mi'') in language x4 (''le glibau'') about subject x3 (''la lojban.'')"
&lt;/div&gt;
''se'' converts the x1 and x2 sumti place. ''fo'' tags the x4 place, and ''fi'' the x3. Such conversion and tagging is often used to emphasize particular sumti by bringing it forward.

Here are some collations of natural languages and Lojban:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''''Labhraíonn Mícheál Gaeilge le Cáit''''' (VSO – [[Irish language|Irish]])&lt;br&gt;speaks | Mícheál | Irish | with Cáit&lt;br&gt;'''''tavla fa la .mixal. fo la sicko'o fe la .kat.'''''&lt;br&gt;speaks | Mícheál | in Irish | to/with Cáit

:'''''Mamaky boky ny mpianatra''''' (VOS – [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]])&lt;br&gt;reads | book | the student&lt;br&gt;'''''tcidu lo cukta fa le tadni'''''&lt;br&gt;reads | a book | the student

:'''''Âi ba, wa mo.''''' (OSV – [[Xavante language|Xavante]])&lt;br&gt;to the-river | I | go&lt;br&gt;'''''fe le rirxe fa mi klama'''''&lt;br&gt;to the river | I | go

:'''''Ihtébani o'ílaci yawi-pó=ra''''' (OVS – [[Guarijio language|Guarijio]])&lt;br&gt;Esteban house-at | dance-[passive].[future]=[reportative] &lt;br&gt;'''''ti'e bu'u le zdani be la .esteban. ba nu dansu'''''&lt;br&gt;[I hear!] at the house of Esteban | [future] event-of dance

:'''僕がこれを作ったんだよ。''' (SOV – [[Japanese language|Japanese]])&lt;br&gt;I | this | made-[assertive-calling]&lt;br&gt;'''''mi ti pu zbasu vau je'uju'i'''''&lt;br&gt;I | this | [past] make [bridi-terminator] [truth-attention]
&lt;/div&gt;

It is important to note that Lojban selbri is not a real equivalent of verb in natural languages. A selbri can be either a verb, a noun, an adjective, or an adverb. Its function is determined syntactically, not morphologically. An analogy to natural language word orders by using such terms as "subject", "verb", and "object" cannot accurately describe the nature of Lojban bridi.

===sumti – arguments of predicates===
There are five kinds of simple sumti:
#'''descriptions''', which usually begin with a descriptor such as ''le'' or more commonly now ''lo'';
#'''pro-sumti''', the Lojban analogue of pronouns, such as ''mi'';
#'''names''', which usually begin with ''la'', such as ''la .lojban.'';
#'''quotations''', which begin with ''lu'', ''lo'u'', ''zo'', ''zoi'';
#'''pure numbers''', which usually begin with ''li''.
&lt;!--Descriptions have the most complicated syntax and usage. Closely interwoven with this kind are names.--&gt;

====description====
Basic descriptions in Lojban consist of two units, LE/LA descriptors and a selbri:
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;'''{{lang|jbo|le zarci}}'''&lt;/span&gt;
Although {{lang|jbo|le}} is quite close in meaning to English "the", it has particularly unique implications. In this example, {{lang|jbo|le}} creates an argument which might occur in the x1 place of the belonging selbri {{lang|jbo|zarci}}, namely a "market". {{lang|jbo|le}} also specifies that the speaker 1) has one or more specific markets in mind (whether or not the listener knows which ones they are) and 2) is merely describing the things he/she has in mind as markets, without being committed to the truth of that description. Whereas English-speakers must differentiate between "the market" and "the markets", Lojban-speakers are not required to make such a choice (this rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of specifying the number of markets in such a case):
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;'''{{lang|jbo|le}}''' {{lang|jbo|zarci cu barda}}&lt;br&gt;'''The''' market '''is''' big. / '''The''' market'''s are''' big.&lt;/span&gt;
Since the construct {{lang|jbo|le}} + ''selbri'' merely describes something or other which the speaker chooses to represent based on his/her observation, such an expression as follows is possible:
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;{{lang|jbo|le nanmu cu ninmu}}&lt;br&gt;one-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe as "men" are women&lt;/span&gt;

While {{lang|jbo|le}} is specific, {{lang|jbo|lo}} is not:
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;'''{{lang|jbo|lo}}''' {{lang|jbo|zarci cu barda}}&lt;br&gt;one-or-more-of-all-the-things-which-really are-markets is/are-big&lt;br&gt;'''A''' market is big. / '''Some '''markets are big.&lt;/span&gt;
{{lang|jbo|lo}} refers generally to one or more markets, without being specific about which. Unlike {{lang|jbo|le zarci}}, {{lang|jbo|lo zarci}} must refer to something which actually is a market (that is, which can appear in the x1 place of a truthful bridi whose selbri is {{lang|jbo|zarci}}). {{lang|jbo|lo morsi cu jmive}} is false as there are no objects in the real world which are both dead and alive.

{{lang|jbo|la}} dissociates the subsequent selbri from its normal meaning, usually making a name (this usage should not be confused with the other usage before regular Lojbanized names). Like {{lang|jbo|le}} descriptions, {{lang|jbo|la}} descriptions are implicitly restricted to those the speaker has in mind:
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;'''{{lang|jbo|la}}''' {{lang|jbo|cribe pu finti le lisri}}&lt;br&gt;'''the-one-named''' "bear" [past] creates the story.&lt;br&gt;Bear wrote the story.&lt;/span&gt;

All descriptions implicitly terminate with {{lang|jbo|ku}}, which can almost always be omitted with no danger of ambiguity. The main exceptions are a) when relative clauses are involved and b) when a description immediately precedes the selbri (in which case using an explicit {{lang|jbo|cu}} before the selbri makes the {{lang|jbo|ku}} unnecessary). Other usages of {{lang|jbo|ku}} include making a compound negator ({{lang|jbo|naku}}) and terminating place-structure/tense/modal tags ({{lang|jbo|puku}}, {{lang|jbo|baiku}}).

===selbri – main verbs of clauses, logical predicates===
The selbri is the [[logical predicate]] of a bridi. This is not to be confused with the meaning of predicate in terms of the English Language, but as a ''logical'' predicate. Whereas a predicate in English contains everything that the subject is doing, a logical predicate is simply the relation between all involved parties.  In this context, the selbri is roughly the equivalent of a [[verb]] in English.  For instance:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''mi '''nelci''' le gerku
:I '''like''' the dog. / I '''like''' the dogs.
&lt;/div&gt;

The gismu ''nelci'' is being used as the selbri in this bridi.  It is describing the relationship between the sumtis ''mi'' (I) and ''le gerku'' (the dog).  The relationship is that of a liker and that which is liked.  The roles in the relationship are determined by the sumti placements inherent in the word being used as the selbri.  The cmavo ''se/te/ve/xe'' are used to swap the first sumti placement of the selbri with the second, third, fourth, and fifth sumti placement, respectively.  This functionality allows for the flexibility in bridi.  For instance, the gismu ''klama'' has the sumti of:
* x1: One which goes
* x2: The destination of a goer
* x3: The source of a goer
* x4: The route taken by a goer
* x5: The vehicle used by a goer

Thus:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''ti '''klama''' ta''
::x1 = ti
::x2 = ta
:This '''goes''' to that.

:''ti '''se klama''' ta''
::x2 = ti
::x1 = ta
:This '''is the destination''' of that.

:''ti '''te klama''' ta''
::x3 = ti
::x2 = ta
:This '''is the source''' of something that goes to that.

: ''ti '''ve klama''' ta''
::x4 = ti
::x2 = ta
:This '''is the route''' of something that goes to that.

: ''ti '''xe klama''' ta''
::x5 = ti
::x2 = ta
:This '''is the vehicle''' of something that goes to that.
&lt;/div&gt;

Selbri can also be tanru, where the sumti placements are determined by the last brivla that is part of the tanru. For instance:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''mi '''gleki klama''' ta''
:I '''am a happy-goer''' that is going to that.

:''mi '''klama gleki''' ta''
:I '''am a going-happy-thing''' that is happy about that.
&lt;/div&gt;

====tanru – compound verbs====
{{Expand section|date=August 2007}}
A group of two or more selbri put one after another is called ''tanru'' and acts as a single selbri (while the selbri it is composed of are called tanru units (''selbrisle'')). They correspond to English compound verbs like ''drip fry'' or ''drip dry''.&lt;!-- They are always divisible into parts without any morphological breakage; they are a mere sequence of multiple gismu or lujvo or fu'ivla rather than a single distinctive morphological unit.--&gt;

Tanru can be converted to sumti as usual selbri.

Tanru may be used so as to more specifically conceptualize the intended meaning. In ''lo skami pilno'' ("computer user(s)"), there is a tanru ''skami pilno'' where the modifying brivla ''skami'' narrows the sense of the modified brivla ''pilno'' to form a more specific concept (in which case the modifier may resemble English adverbs or adjectives). Without ''skami'', ''lo pilno'' will just mean "user". Other examples:
&lt;div style=color:#506060&gt;
:''ti '''mutce xajmi''''' ("This is '''very funny'''.")

:''do '''melbi se kanla''''' ("You have '''beautiful eye(s)'''.")

:''.ue.oi le '''mabla bebna''' cu zvati ti'' ("Oh my gosh the '''damn idiot''' is here.")
&lt;/div&gt;

Arguments of selbri representing tanru units may be filled as well, in which case they are attached using the particle ''be'' (starting from x2 place of the tanru unit):
&lt;div style=color:#506060&gt;
:''ti melbi be mi ractu'' ("This is a pretty to me rabbit.")
&lt;/div&gt;

===cmavo===
The ''cmavo'' consist of various particles and structure words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lojban.github.io/cll/4/2/|title=The Shape Of Words To Come: Lojban Morphology - The Lojban Reference Grammar|website=lojban.github.io|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include descriptors, connectives, attitudinals, prepositions, and tense words.

====Descriptors====
There are five descriptors (''gadri'' in Lojban): ''lo'', ''le'', ''la'', ''li'', and ''me'o''; of which the first three inflect to show individual, mass, or set (though as far as the formal grammar is concerned, the inflected forms are separate words, not inflected forms).
{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" class="wikitable"
! !! &lt;span style="color:#909090;"&gt;Individual&lt;/span&gt; !! &lt;span style="color:#909090;"&gt;Mass&lt;/span&gt; !! &lt;span style="color:#909090;"&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt; !! &lt;span style="color:#909090;"&gt;Typical&lt;/span&gt;
|-
! Indefinite
| lo || loi || lo'i || lo'e
|-
! Definite
| le || lei || le'i || le'e
|-
! Name
| la || lai || la'i || –
|-
! Number
| li || – || – || –
|-
! Mathematical expression
| me'o || – || – || –
|}

The individual/mass distinction is similar to the distinction between [[mass noun]]s and [[count noun]]s, but things that are normally counted can be considered as a mass. The set articles consider the [[mathematical set]] of the referents.

&lt;div style=color:#506060&gt;
:'''''lo'i jurme''' bene'i mi cu bramau '''lo'i mi mivysle''''' ("'''The set of bacteria''' inside me is bigger than '''the set of my cells'''." With ''loi'' this would be false, as the bacteria, though more in number, have less mass.)

:'''''lo mi kerfa''' cu jdari .iku'i '''loi mi kerfa''' cu ranti'' ("'''My hairs''' are hard, but '''my hair''' is soft.")
&lt;/div&gt;

The number and mathematical expression articles are used when talking about numbers and numerals or letters as themselves.

&lt;div style=color:#506060&gt;
:'''''bi''' jgena'' ("'''eight''' knots")

:''lo '''me li bi''' jgena'' ("an '''eight''' knot", whatever that is; perhaps it has eight loops)

:''lo '''me me'o bi''' jgena'' ("a '''figure-eight''' knot")
&lt;/div&gt;

Note that ''gadri'' are sometimes called ''articles'', which doesn't correspond to the usual notion of [[article (grammar)|article]]s in linguistics.

====Connectives====
As befits a logical language, there is a large assortment of [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]s.

There exist 16 possible different [[truth function]]s, the four fundamental ones of which are assigned four vowels in Lojban. These vowels are a component sound from which actual logical-connective cmavo are built up.
:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" class="wikitable"
|A || FIRST is true '''and/or''' SECOND is true (TTTF)
|-
|E || FIRST is true '''and''' SECOND is true (TFFF)
|-
|O || FIRST is true '''if and only if''' SECOND is true (TFFT)
|-
|U || FIRST is true '''whether or not''' SECOND is true (TTFF)
|}

&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''la .djekl. '''.a''' la .xaid. zvati ti''&lt;br&gt;Jekyll '''and/or''' Hyde is/are here.

:''la .djekl. '''.e''' la .xaid. zvati ti''&lt;br&gt;Jekyll '''and''' Hyde is here.

:''la .djekl. '''.o''' la .xaid. zvati ti''&lt;br&gt;Jekyll '''if-and-only-if''' Hyde is here.

:''la .djekl. '''.u''' la .xaid. zvati ti''&lt;br&gt;Jekyll '''whether-or-not''' Hyde is here.
&lt;/div&gt;

With the four vowels, the ability to negate either sentence (with ''na'' or ''nai''), and the ability to exchange the sentences, as if their order had been reversed (with ''se''), Lojban can create all of the 16 possible truth functions except TTTT and FFFF (which are fairly useless anyway).

''.onai'' is preferred over ''na.o''. Note that in ''se.unai'', the negation occurs before "swapping" the positions of A and B. While ''se'' can be used for the other connectives, it is unnecessary since ''or'', ''and'', and ''if and only if'' have the same relationship if their inputs are swapped (i.e. they are [[Commutative property|commutative]]).

&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''la .djekl. '''na.a''' la .xaid. zvati ti''&lt;br&gt;Jekyll '''only-if''' Hyde is here. / Jekyll is here only if Hyde is here

:''la .djekl. '''.enai''' la .xaid. zvati ti''&lt;br&gt;Jekyll '''and-not''' Hyde is here. / Jekyll, but not Hyde, is here.

:''la .djekl. '''.onai''' la .xaid. zvati ti''&lt;br&gt;Jekyll '''either/or''' Hyde is here. / Either Jekyll or Hyde is here, but not both.

:''la .djekl. '''se.u''' la .xaid. zvati ti''&lt;br&gt;'''Regardless of''' Jekyll, Hyde is here. / Whether or not Jekyll is here, Hyde is.
&lt;/div&gt;

In order to remain unambiguous, each place in the grammar of the language where logical connection is permitted has its appropriate set of connectives. If the connective suitable for sumti were used to connect selbri, ambiguity would result. Connections between components other than sumti can be expressed as follows (note that their functions are in accordance with the assigned vowels):
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''la .djekl. tavla '''.ija''' la .xaid. tavla'' (between sentences)&lt;br&gt;Jekyll speaks. '''And/or''' Hyde speaks.

:''la .djekl. mikce la xaid. '''gi'e''' nanmu'' (between bridi)&lt;br&gt;Jekyll is a doctor of Hyde '''and''' is a man.

:''la .djekl. sipna '''je''' cadzu'' (between gismu)&lt;br&gt;Jekyll sleeps-'''and'''-walks.
&lt;/div&gt;

Negatives and ''se'' can be used with these connectives with similar forms.
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''la .djekl. tavla '''.ijanai''' la .xaid. tavla'' (between sentences)&lt;br&gt;Jekyll speaks. '''If''' Hyde speaks.

:''la .djekl. mikce '''nagi'e''' nanmu'' (between bridi)&lt;br&gt;Jekyll is a doctor '''but not''' a man.

:''la .djekl. sipna '''seju''' cadzu'' (between gismu)&lt;br&gt;'''Regardless as to whether''' Jekyll sleeps, he walks.
&lt;/div&gt;

Connections can also be given using "forethought" forms
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''''ge''' la .djekl. '''gi''' la .xaid. zvati ti''&lt;br&gt;Jekyll '''and''' Hyde are here.

:''la .djekl. '''gu'e''' sipna '''gi''' cadzu''&lt;br&gt;Jekyll sleeps-'''and'''-walks.
&lt;/div&gt;

Negatives are created by adding ''nai'' to the connective before the negated construct.

&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''''genai''' la .djekl. '''gi''' la .xaid. zvati ti''&lt;br&gt;'''Not''' Jekyll '''but''' Hyde is here.

:'''''ge''' la .djekl. '''ginai''' la .xaid. zvati ti''&lt;br&gt;Jekyll '''but not''' Hyde is here.
&lt;/div&gt;

Connections can be questioned:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''la .djekl. '''ji''' la .xaid. tavla''&lt;br&gt;Jekyll ['''what?'''] Hyde speaks.&lt;br&gt;Does Jekyll or Hyde speak?

:''la .djekl. sipna '''je'i''' cadzu''&lt;br&gt;Jekyll sleeps ['''what?'''] walks.&lt;br&gt;Does Jekyll sleep or walk?
&lt;/div&gt;

Besides the logical connectives, there are several non-logical connectives. These do not change form depending on what they are connecting:

:{| class="wikitable"
| (A) ''joi'' (B) || the mass with components A and B
|-
| (A) ''ce'' (B) || the [[set (mathematics)|set]] with elements A and B
|-
| (A) ''ce'o'' (B) || the sequence with elements A and B in order
|-
| (A) ''sece'o'' (B) || the sequence with elements B and A in order
|-
| (A) ''jo'u'' (B) || A and B considered jointly
|-
| (A) ''fa'u'' (B) || A and B respectively
|-
| (A) ''sefa'u'' (B) || B and A respectively
|-
| (A) ''jo'e'' (B) || the [[union (set theory)|union]] of sets A and B
|-
| (A) ''ku'a'' (B) || the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of sets A and B
|-
| (A) ''pi'u'' (B) || the [[Cartesian product|cross product]] of sets A and B
|-
| (A) ''sepi'u'' (B) || the cross product of sets B and A
|-
|}

&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''lo lanme [ku] '''fa'u''' lo guzme cu danlu '''fa'u''' spati''&lt;br&gt;Sheep '''and''' melons are animals '''and''' plants, '''respectively'''.

:''la .treid. '''ku'a''' la .traian. midju la .carlyt.''&lt;br&gt;Trade '''intersect''' Tryon is the center of Charlotte.

:''lo rukygu'e cu xazdo '''joi''' ropno''&lt;br&gt;Russia is Asian '''together with''' European.
&lt;/div&gt;
The ''ku'' is required by the [[LALR]] parser, but not by the [[Parsing expression grammar|PEG]] parser, which however is not official yet.

====Attitudinals====
Attitudinals are a set of cmavo which allow the speakers to express their ''emotional state'' or ''source of knowledge'', or the ''present stage of discourse''. In natural languages, attitudes are expressed using [[interjection]]s, but also by the [[tone of voice]] when speaking, and (very imperfectly) by [[punctuation]] when writing; in Lojban, such information are extensively expressible in words. And the meanings are to be understood separately from the main predicate.
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''''.iu''''' ('''love''')

:'''''.ui''''' ('''happy''')
&lt;/div&gt;
They may be "scaled" by suffixes:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''.ui'''nai''''' (happy-'''not''' = unhappy)

:''.ui'''cai''''' (happy-'''intense''' = very very happy)

:''.ui'''cu'i''''' (happy-'''neutral''')
&lt;/div&gt;
Combination is possible, and highly productive as well as creative:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''''.uinaicai''''' ('''happy-not-intense''')

:'''''.iu.uinai''''' ('''love-happy-not''' = I am unhappily in love)
&lt;/div&gt;
''Evidentials'', derived from those of [[American Indian languages]] and the constructed language [[Láadan]], show how the speaker came to say the utterance, i.e. the source of the information or the idea:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:'''''ti'e''' la .uengas cu zergau''&lt;br&gt;['''I hear!'''] Wenga is-a-crime-doer.&lt;br&gt;I hear that Wenga is a crook.

:'''''ba'a'''cu'i le tuple be mi cu se cortu''&lt;br&gt;['''I experience!'''] The leg of me is-the-locus-of-pain.&lt;br&gt;My leg hurts.

:'''''pe'i''' la .kartagos. '''.ei''' se daspo''&lt;br&gt;['''I opine!'''] Carthage [obligation] is-destroyed.&lt;br&gt;In my opinion, [[Carthago delenda est|Carthage should be destroyed]].
&lt;/div&gt;

====Prepositions====
There are two kinds of prepositions (''sumtcita'', which refers to [[adposition]]s in general) in Lojban: tense markers and proper prepositions. The syntactic difference is that a proper preposition can be converted with ''se'', whereas a tense marker cannot. All proper prepositions (except the vague one ''do'e'') are formed from a brivla and mark their object semantically as being in a place of that brivla. Thus the following are equivalent:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:''mi pilno lo me'andi lo nu skagau lei kerfa''&lt;br&gt;I use henna to color the hair.

:''mi skagau lei kerfa '''sepi'o''' lo me'andi''&lt;br&gt;I color the hair '''with''' henna.
&lt;/div&gt;
Prepositions (including tense markers) can also be placed in ''.i ... bo'' to make sentence conjunctions. With most prepositions this makes no sense, but ''ki'u'', ''ja'e'', ''mu'i'' and ''ni'i'' are often used this way to express various kinds of "because" and "therefore":
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;''la .djan. cpacu le pamoi se jinga .i'''ki'u'''bo ri jinga''&lt;br&gt;John got the first prize '''because''' he won.&lt;/span&gt;

====Tense words====

Lojban has 63 unique [[Grammatical tense|tense words]] to express various aspects of both ''space'' and ''time'' as well as ''event'': such a system is unusual among other languages, in that it deals with spatial and temporal aspects in the same term. Simply put, these tense words are used to show where and when the event is taking place, relative in space-time to when the sentence is spoken.
They can be roughly subdivided as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
!Intervals
| {{lang|jbo|pu}} (before), {{lang|jbo|ca}} (during), {{lang|jbo|ba}} (after), {{lang|jbo|bu'u}} (at/coincident with), {{lang|jbo|ne'a}} (next to), {{lang|jbo|re'o}} (adjacent to), {{lang|jbo|te'e}} (bordering), {{lang|jbo|pa'o}} (passing through), {{lang|jbo|ne'i}} (within), {{lang|jbo|fa'a}} (towards), {{lang|jbo|to'o}} (away from), {{lang|jbo|ze'o}} (outward), {{lang|jbo|zo'a}} (inward), {{lang|jbo|zo'a}} (passing by/tangential to), {{lang|jbo|ga'u}} (above), {{lang|jbo|ni'a}} (below), {{lang|jbo|ca'u}} (in front of), {{lang|jbo|ti'a}} (behind), {{lang|jbo|ri'u}} (to the right of), {{lang|jbo|zu'a}} (to the left of), {{lang|jbo|be'a}} (north of), {{lang|jbo|ne'u}} (south of), {{lang|jbo|vu'a}} (west of), {{lang|jbo|du'a}} (east of), {{lang|jbo|ru'u}} (surrounding), {{lang|jbo|cu'e}} (when/where, as a question word)
|-
!Modifiers
| {{lang|jbo|zi}} (a short time away), {{lang|jbo|za}} (a medium-length time away), {{lang|jbo|zu}} (a long time away), {{lang|jbo|vi}} (a short distance away, here), {{lang|jbo|va}} (a medium distance away, near), {{lang|jbo|vu}} (a long distance away, there), {{lang|jbo|ze'i}} (for a short time), {{lang|jbo|ze'a}} (for a medium-length time), {{lang|jbo|ze'u}} (for a long time), {{lang|jbo|ze'e}} (for the whole time), {{lang|jbo|ve'i}} (in a small area), {{lang|jbo|ve'a}} (in a medium-sized area), {{lang|jbo|ve'u}} (in a large area), {{lang|jbo|ve'e}} (in the whole area), {{lang|jbo|vi'i}} (along a (1D) line), {{lang|jbo|vi'a}} (throughout a (2D) area), {{lang|jbo|vi'u}} (throughout a (3D) space), {{lang|jbo|vi'e}} (throughout a (4D) spacetime)
|-
!Contours
| {{lang|jbo|ca'o}} (continuative, during), {{lang|jbo|pu'o}} (anticipative, until), {{lang|jbo|ba'o}} (perfective, since), {{lang|jbo|co'a}} (initiative, at the start), {{lang|jbo|co'i}} (achievative, at instantaneous point of), {{lang|jbo|co'u}} (cessative, at the end even if premature), {{lang|jbo|mo'u}} (completive, at natural end), {{lang|jbo|za'o}} (superfective, continuing after natural end), {{lang|jbo|de'a}} (pausative, temporary pause), {{lang|jbo|di'a}} (resumptive, continuing after pause)
|-
!Converters
| {{lang|jbo|mo'i}}, {{lang|jbo|fe'e}}, {{lang|jbo|roi}}, {{lang|jbo|re'u}}, {{lang|jbo|jai}}, {{lang|jbo|ki}}
|}

The "converters" require further explanation: {{lang|jbo|mo'i}} marks that the movement is towards (or away from, etc.) a point rather than at a point, so that {{lang|jbo|be'a}}, meaning {{nowrap begin}}"(occurring){{nowrap end}} in the north", becomes {{lang|jbo|mo'ibe'a}}, {{nowrap begin}}"(heading){{nowrap end}} northward"; {{lang|jbo|roi}} marks the number of times an event takes place, e.g. {{lang|jbo|paroi}} (once), {{lang|jbo|roroi}} (always), {{lang|jbo|noroi}} (never), {{lang|jbo|re'u}} indicated an ordinal, e.g. {{lang|jbo|pare'u}}, first time; {{lang|jbo|fe'e}} marks an interval in space rather than in time, so that, for example, {{lang|jbo|fe'e co'a}} is the "beginning point" of something physically extending in a given direction; {{lang|jbo|jai}} is used to mark tense words that have been moved in a sentence, comparable to {{lang|jbo|se/te/ve/xe}} and {{lang|jbo|fa/fe/fi/fo/fu}} for sumti; {{lang|jbo|ki}} marks a "sticky tense", as explained below.

Marking tenses is always optional in Lojban:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:{{lang|jbo|mi klama le zarci}} (default: no temporal tense)&lt;br&gt;I went/have-gone/go/am-going/will-go/continually-go-to the-market.

:{{lang|jbo|mi '''ba'o''' klama le zarci}}&lt;br&gt;I '''have'''-go'''ne'''-to the-market.''

:{{lang|jbo|mi '''capu'o''' klama le zarci}}&lt;br&gt;I '''am-about'''-go'''ing'''-to the-market.''
&lt;/div&gt;
Where the tense information is not specified, the context resolves the interpretation.

Tense words are usually put right before the selbri:
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;{{lang|jbo|mi [cu] '''pu''' klama le zarci}} ({{lang|jbo|cu}} is the implicit separator between the first sumti {{lang|jbo|mi}} and the selbri {{lang|jbo|klama}}.)&lt;/span&gt;
They may be placed elsewhere with the additional terminator {{lang|jbo|ku}}:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:{{lang|jbo|'''pu ku''' mi [cu] klama le zarci}}

:{{lang|jbo|mi [cu] klama '''pu ku''' le zarci}}

:{{lang|jbo|mi [cu] klama le zarci '''pu''' ['''ku''']}} ({{lang|jbo|ku}} is elidable at the end of the bridi)
&lt;/div&gt;
The terminator is used so that the tense word do not directly run into the following sumti and modify it. Compare the next sentences:
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:{{lang|jbo|ba ku le nunsalci cu cfari}}&lt;br&gt;[At some point in the future] the festival will start.

:{{lang|jbo|ba le nunsalci cu cfari}}&lt;br&gt;After the festival, [something unspecified] will start.
&lt;/div&gt;

Tenses can be "layered up":
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;{{lang|jbo|mi '''pu''' klama le zdani .i le zdani '''pu pu''' se daspo}}&lt;br&gt;I [past] go-to the house. The house [past][past] be-destroyed.&lt;br&gt;I went to the house. The house had been destroyed.&lt;/span&gt;

Tenses can be "sticky" by being set with {{lang|jbo|ki}}, continuing in effect over more than a single bridi, until it is unset:
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;{{lang|jbo|mi pu '''ki''' fengu binxo .i le nixli cu klaku cfari .i mi '''ki''' xenru}}&lt;br&gt;I [past]-[set this tense] angry-kind-of become. The girl crying-kind-of start. I [set this tense] regret.&lt;br&gt;(Earlier) I got angry. The girl started crying. (Now) I regret.&lt;/span&gt;
The second {{lang|jbo|ki}} resets the tense to the implicit default time from the speaker's point of view, which is "now" (this means that {{lang|jbo|ki}} may be used as a tense word by itself).

Using {{lang|jbo|ki}}, equivalents of the previous layering tenses can be produced:
:&lt;span style="color:#506060"&gt;{{lang|jbo|mi puki klama le zdani .i le zdani pu se daspo}}&lt;/span&gt;
The second {{lang|jbo|pu}} is to be counted from the tense set by the last {{lang|jbo|ki}}, so in effect it is equivalent to {{lang|jbo|pupu}}.

Similar to the tense words are a collection of words to show potentiality: {{lang|jbo|ca'a}}, "actually is"; {{lang|jbo|ka'e}}, "is innately capable of"; {{lang|jbo|nu'o}}, "can but has not"; {{lang|jbo|pu'i}}, "can and has". These words operate in the same way as tense words.
&lt;div style="color:#506060"&gt;
:{{lang|jbo|la verba '''ca'a''' sanga}}&lt;br&gt;The child is (actually, currently) singing.

:{{lang|jbo|la verba '''ka'e''' sanga}}&lt;br&gt;The child '''is naturally capable''' of singing.&lt;br&gt;The child can sing.

:{{lang|jbo|la verba '''nu'o''' sanga}}&lt;br&gt;The child '''has the undemonstrated potential for''' singing.&lt;br&gt;The child can sing, but hasn't sung yet.

:{{lang|jbo|la verba '''pu'i''' sanga}}&lt;br&gt;The child '''has the demonstrated potential for''' singing.&lt;br&gt;The child can sing, and has shown that it can.
&lt;/div&gt;

====Grouping====
Semantic unifications and combinations are performed by word groupings, each include a starting and a (often elidable) terminating cmavo. Here basic example sentences with them are ordered by their terminating cmavo:

{{Refimprove|date=February 2018}}

A '''loose cannon''' refers to a [[cannon]] which gets dislocated and moves about randomly on the decks of a battleship, creating a hazard to crew and equipment.

A famous literary depiction of a loose cannon appears in [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1874 novel "[[Ninety-Three]]", whose plot is set during the [[French Revolution]]. In a well-known episode, a ship of anti-revolutionary French Royalists is sailing towards [[Brittany]], to aid the anti-revolutionary [[Chouannerie]] rebellion. While at sea, a sailor fails to properly secure his cannon, which rolls out of control and damages the ship. The sailor risks his life to secure the cannon and save the ship. The Marquis de Lantenac, leader of the Royalists, awards the man a medal for his bravery and then executes him without trial for failing in his duty.&lt;ref&gt;[[#hugo|Hugo, 1888]], p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread publication of Hugo's book, both in the original French and in translation to various other languages, helped make the concept of a loose cannon more well-known. It has eventually developed a metaphorical meaning relating to a person who is acting in a wild and unpredictable manner and who constitutes as much danger to his or her own side as to the enemy.

'''Matthijs Siegenbeek''' ({{IPA-nl|mɑˈtɛi̯s ˈsiɣə(m)ˌbeːk}}) (23 June 1774 in [[Amsterdam]] – 26 November 1854 in [[Leiden]]) was a Dutch academic. From 1797 to 1847 he was the first professor of the [[Dutch language]] at the [[University of Leiden]]. From 1803 he was the member, then secretary, of the head-office of that university's literary faculty. Initially he was a [[Mennonite]] [[minister of religion|voorganger]] in [[Dokkum]].

==Spelling-Siegenbeek==
In 1804 Siegenbeek set out the [[history of Dutch orthography|official spelling]] of Dutch. This was attacked by the poet [[Willem Bilderdijk]]. &lt;!---Dat had geen nut; de Siegenbeek-spelling werd gehandhaafd tot [[Geschiedenis van de Nederlandse spelling]],  (De Vries en Te Winkel), [[1864]]/[[1883]].

Siegenbeek was van mening dat de spelling de beschaafde Hollandse uitspraak van een woord moest weergeven. Daarbij moest echter wel rekening gehouden worden met de principes van de gelijkvormigheid, de [[etymologie]] en de analogie. Aan de spelling-Siegenbeek heeft het huidige Nederlands de schrijfwijze van de lange ij als in (ijzer) te danken, eerder ook vaak als yzer geschreven. Kenmerkende schrijfwijzen voor deze spelling zijn bijvoorbeeld berigt, blaauw, Dingsdag, gooijen, magt, kagchel, koningrijk, muzijk en zamen.
---&gt;
From 1818 he became a member of the [[Teylers First Society]].

==History==
{{further|Immigration to Denmark}}

Throughout much of its history, Denmark has been home to a population of [[Low German]] speakers in many of its towns, including the capital Copenhagen. Rural settlers known as "[[potato Germans]]" and "[[:da:Polske landarbejdere i Danmark|beet Poles]]" also brought their own languages to Danish farms. During the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] was spoken among descendants of Dutch/Flemish settlers on the island of [[Amager]] ([[Dragør]], [[Store Magleby]] and [[Christianshavn]]). In its heyday, the [[Royal Danish Navy]] was largely manned by [[Norwegian language|Norwegian speakers]]. Additionally, [[North Frisian]] was spoken on the [[North Frisian Islands]]. During the 19th century, [[German Jews]] brought the [[Yiddish language]] to Copenhagen and a few other towns, and in the early 20th century, an influx of [[Russian Jews]] gave this language a brief revival. 

However, subsequent generations of all these groups have overwhelmingly [[language shift|abandoned their ancestral languages]] and assimilated into the general population.

==Protection==
[[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] entered into force in Denmark on 1 February 1998 while [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] entered into force on 1 January 2001.&lt;ref name="THE GERMAN MINORITY IN DENMARK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denmark.dk/en/society/greenland-the-faroes-and-the-german-minority/the-german-minority-in-denmark/|title=THE GERMAN MINORITY IN DENMARK|publisher=Denmark.dk-The Official Website of Denmark| format=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==

===German===
[[File:Knowledge of German in Denmark, 2005.png|thumb|right|300px|Knowledge of the German language in Denmark, 2005.]]
[[North Schleswig Germans]] language rights are protected by the [[Copenhagen-Bonn Declarations]] of 1955.&lt;ref name="Language" /&gt; Outside the minority area German is used by members of St. Peter's parish in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name="Euromosaic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/alemany/an/i2/i2.html|title=German in Denmark|publisher=Euromosaic|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 24 German kindergartens and 18 German schools are maintained by the German School and Language Association.&lt;ref name="Euromosaic" /&gt; Although the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages stipulates the right of the German minority to use their own forms of geographical names, no steps have been taken in this direction.&lt;ref name="University of Copenhagen-Linguistic Minorities and Geographical Names"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nordendivision.nfi.ku.dk/minorities/|title=Linguistic Minorities and Geographical Names|publisher=[[University of Copenhagen]]| format=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenlandic and Faeroese languages===
First-generation [[Greenlandic people in Denmark|Greenlanders in Denmark]] and [[Faroese Dane|Faroese in Denmark]] tend to speak their own languages, rather than Danish.

===Romani===
In 2011 ''Committee of Ministers of [[Council of Europe]]'' recommended that the Danish authorities clarify the issue of the traditional presence of the [[Romani language]] in country.&lt;ref name="Council of Europe-R-2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/Report/EvaluationReports/DenmarkECRML3_en.pdf|title=Report of the Committee of Experts on the Charter|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]| format=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities responded that they have reviewed multiple sources and tried also to obtain information by contacting universities in [[Scandinavia]], but did not find any documentation in support of the traditional presence of the Romani language in Denmark.&lt;ref name="Council of Europe-R-2011" /&gt; During the on-the-spot visit, the Committee of Experts met with a representative of the Romani People who argued that there are around 5.000 persons still living in Denmark who might be considered descendants of ten [[Sinti]] families that came from [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Council of Europe-R-2011" /&gt;

'''Mintil''' (alternatively '''Batek Tanum''' or '''Tanɨm''') is a possibly extinct aboriginal [[Mon–Khmer language]] of [[Malaysia|Malaya]]. In the late 1960s, Geoffrey Benjamin had come across speakers of Mintil among patients of an Orang Asli hospital at Ulu Gombak, just outside [[Kuala Lumpur]] (Benjamin 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Geoffrey. 2012. ‘The Aslian languages of Malaysia and Thailand: an assessment.’ In: Peter K.

'''Organisational semiotics''' examines the nature, characteristics and features of [[information]], and studies how information can be best used in the context of organised activities and business domains. Organisational semiotics treats organisations as [[information systems]] in which information is created, processed, distributed, stored and used. It benefits from the research of [[semiotics]] in various schools, and further develops its theoretical frameworks, methods and techniques for understanding, analysing, modelling, designing and implementing of information systems.

==History==

Organizational semiotics started around 1973 with [[Ronald Stamper]]’s seminal book on Information (Stamper, 1973), a book that was intended to be the first chapter of a book on information systems design called ‘organizational semiotics’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Featured as an interdisciplinary undertaking, researchers working in the community of organisational semiotics come from different backgrounds and work together on the theoretical and practical issues relating to organisational and technical problems. From the first international meeting on organisational semiotics in 1995, the community aims to develop the subject into a science of information systems, as claimed at the IFIP 8.1 Working Conference.&lt;ref&gt;“Organisational Semiotics: Evolving a science of information systems”, book edited by [[Kecheng Liu]], Rodney J. Clarke, Peter B Andersen and Ronald Stamper, with El-Sayed Abou-Zeid, 2002 {{ISBN|1-4020-7189-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Conference on Informatics and Semiotics in Organisations is the flagship conference of the community of which [[Kecheng Liu]] and the Informatics Research Centre &lt;ref&gt; Informatics Research Centre, Henley Business School, University of Reading [https://www.henley.ac.uk/research/research-centres/informatics-research-centre/]&lt;/ref&gt; have been convening over the past years.

The '''Proceedings in Courts of Justice Act 1730''' (''4 Geo II. c. 26'')&lt;ref&gt;"4th year of the reign of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], chapter 26."&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] which made [[English language|English]] (instead of [[Law French]] and [[Latin]]) the obligatory language for use in the courts of England and in the [[Court of Exchequer (Scotland)|court of exchequer]] in Scotland. The Act followed a medieval law from 1362 (the [[Pleading in English Act 1362]]&lt;ref&gt;36 Edw. III c. 15&lt;/ref&gt;), which had made it permissible to debate cases in English, but all written records had continued to be in Latin. It was amended shortly later to extend it to the courts in Wales,&lt;ref&gt;6 Geo II. c. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and to exempt from its provisions the "court of the receipt of his Majesty's exchequer" in England.&lt;ref&gt;6 Geo. II. c. 26&lt;/ref&gt; It never applied to cases heard overseas in the [[court of admiralty]].

A similar act was pasted on 22 November 1650 by the [[Rump Parliament]] during the [[Commonwealth of England]]: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56426 Act for turning the Books of the Law and all Process and Proceedings in Courts of Justice into the English Tongue].

The Act was introduced by the then [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Peter King, 1st Baron King|Lord King]], and came into force on 25 March 1733. It was repealed by the [[Civil Procedure Acts Repeal Act 1879]].&lt;ref&gt;42 &amp; 43 Vict c 59&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar Act was passed by the [[Parliament of Ireland]] in 1737, the [[Administration of Justice (Language) Act (Ireland) 1737]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1487">In the [[Neo-Gricean]] approach to [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]] advanced by [[Yale]] linguist [[Laurence Horn]], the R-Principle ("R" for "Relation") is a reformulation of [[Paul Grice]]'s Maxim of Relation (''see'' [[Gricean maxims]]) combining with the second sub-maxim of Quantity and the third and fourth sub-maxims of Manner.&lt;ref name=Horn1989&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horn |first1=Laurence |title=A Natural History of Negation |date=1989|publisher=The University of Chicago press |location=Chicago, IL |pages=193-203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R-Principle states: "Say no more than you must (given Q)." As such it interacts with the [[Q-principle]], which states: "Say as much as you can (given R)." &lt;ref name = SEP&gt; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/ "Implicature"] in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] .&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = ECS&gt; [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0470018860.s00233/full "The Gricean Model"] in the Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science. &lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the R-Principle, there is no reason to make a stronger statement (say more) if the extra information can be contributed by implicature. For instance, the inference from "He broke a finger" to "He broke a finger of his own" is an R-based inference, i.e. deriving from the R-Principle, since the economy of expression implies that a more informative statement was not needed. &lt;ref name = SEP /&gt;

'''Robert Hayward Barlow''' (May 18, 1918 – January 1 or 2, 1951&lt;ref name="js2007xx"&gt;Joshi &amp; Schultz (2007): p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[United States|American]] [[author]], avant-garde poet, [[anthropologist]] and [[historian]] of early [[Mexico]], and expert in the [[Nahuatl]] language. He was a correspondent and friend of horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and was appointed by Lovecraft the executor of his literary estate.&lt;ref name="joshi"&gt;S.T. Joshi, ''I Am Providence: The Life &amp; Times of H.P. Lovecraft.'' Hippocampus, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poole"&gt;W. Scott Poole, ''In the Mountains of Madness: The Life &amp; Extraordinary Afterlife of H.P. Lovecraft.'' Soft Skull, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born at a time when his father Lieutenant Colonel Everett Darius Barlow, was serving with the American Forces in France, Barlow spent much of his youth at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where his father was stationed but also moved from army post to army post in his earliest years. as a result, he never received much formal schooling but he was a brilliant youth and pursued his education on his own. &lt;ref&gt;Kenneth W. Faig, Jr "Robert H. Barlow and H. P. Lovecraft: A Reflection" in Robert H. Barlow, ''Annals of the Jinns'' West Warwick, RI: Necronomicon Press, 1978, p. 2 &lt;/ref&gt; Around 1932 Col. Barlow received a medical discharge, retired on disability from the army and settled his wife (Bernice Barlow) and son in the small town of [[DeLand, Florida|DeLand]], in central [[Florida]] where he built a lakeside homestead.

Family difficulties later forced Robert H. Barlow to move to [[Washington, D.C.]], where in 1934, as the son of a retired army officer, he received treatment for over-strained eyes at an army facility before returning to DeLand in 1935. In 1936, he received training at the [[Kansas City Art Institute]], where [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] was one of his teachers, and subsequently at [[San Francisco Junior College]]. Barlow settled for a time with the Beck family in [[Lakeport, California]], where he helped publish H. P. Lovecraft's ''Commonplace Book'' and several other items from Beck's Futile Press. From Lakeport was mailed the second and final issue of his legendary amateur magazine ''Leaves'', which he and Lovecraft had planned together before the latter's death.  

Following a suggestion from an interested counsellor and friend, Barbara Mayer, that Barlow make the study of Mexico's antiquities his goal, he went to Mexico in 1940-41, studied at the [[Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas]], and upon his return to California received the B.A. degree at the [[University of California]] in 1942. Returning to Mexico as a permanent resident, he joined the staff of the [[Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico]]. In 1944 he received a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and in 1946-48 a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]. He became head of the Department of Anthropology at [[Mexico City College]], which position he held at the time of his passing on January 2, 1951.

According to fellow anthropologist [[Charles E. Dibble]], "In the brief span of a decade, Barlow gave Middle American research an impetus and perspective of enduring consequence. His contributions in Mexican archaeology, classical and modern Nahuatl, Mexican colonial history, and what he preferred to call "Bilderhandschriften" are of lasting importance." Dibble compared Barlow's zeal for searching for and deciphering little known or dimly recalled codices and colonial manuscripts to that of [[Zelia Nuttall]].&lt;ref name=dibble&gt;Charles E. Dibble. "Robert Hayward Barlow - 1918–1951". ''American Antiquity'' 16 (4): 347.&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow has been referred to as "the [[T. E. Lawrence]] of Mexico.'' &lt;ref&gt;Mooser, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===Lovecraft associate===
Barlow had been a friend of writers [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and [[Robert E. Howard]] since he was 13. He collaborated with Lovecraft on at least six stories ("The Slaying of the Monster" (1933); "The Hoard of the Wizard-Beast" (1933); the spoof "The Battle That Ended the Century" (1934); "[[Till A’the Seas]]" (1935); an unfinished parody, "Collapsing Cosmoses" (1935); and "The Night Ocean" (1936)), and Lovecraft made several extended visits to the young Barlow at his home in DeLand, Florida.

Barlow attempted to bind and distribute Lovecraft's story "The Shunned House" (1928) but bound only a few copies ([[Arkham House]] distributed some bound versions of the original Barlow project as late as the 1970s).

Barlow aided significantly in the preservation of Lovecraft's manuscripts by typing texts in exchange for autograph manuscripts.

Barlow came to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] immediately upon receiving a telegram from Lovecraft's aunt Annie Gamwell about Lovecraft's death. Lovecraft's "Instructions In Case Of Decease", a separate document from his will, appointed Barlow his [[literary executor]]. Lovecraft biographer S.T. Joshi says that this document was never probated but that Ms. Gamwell created a formal contract confirming that Barlow was to have all of Lovecraft's manuscripts and notebooks, to publish as he saw fit, earnings from said publication to go to Ms. Gamwell with a 3% commission for himself.&lt;ref name="joshi"/&gt;Lovecraft biographer W. Scott Poole says that Ms. Gamwell did have the document probated.&lt;ref name="poole"/&gt; Barlow donated most of the manuscripts and some printed matter to the [[John Hay Library]] of [[Brown University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-complicated-friendship-of-h-p-lovecraft-and-robert-barlow-one-of-his-biggest-fans|title=The Complicated Friendship of H. P. Lovecraft and Robert Barlow, One of His Biggest Fans|author=Paul La Farge|date=9 March 2017|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barlow transcribed Lovecraft's story "The Shadow Out of Time" and had the manuscript still in his possession when he secured a teaching position at Mexico City College. When he later became Chairman of the Department of Anthropology, he met June Ripley, a postgraduate student studying the Nahuatl language, Barlow's specialty. The two apparently became friends and Barlow entrusted the manuscript to Ripley before his suicide. She remained in Mexico for seven more years, then taught at several places in the United States before retiring in 1993. She died on December 28, 1994, and the long-lost Lovecraft manuscript was found by Ripley's sister-in-law Lucille Shreve. The manuscript, written in pencil in a child's notebook, was donated by Nelson and Lucille Shreve to the Lovecraft collection of [[John Hay Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.brown.edu/publications/Bibliofile/Biblio24/time.html "The Shadow Out of Time"], Brown University Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.brown.edu/friends/publications/AFspring95/Lovecraft.html "Mysterious Lovecraft Manuscript"], Brown University Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.brown.edu/collatoz/info.php?id=73 "H.P. Lovecraft Collection"], Brown University Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author, publisher===
Barlow was interested in printing and after becoming involved in the early 'fan' scene relating to fantasy and science fiction, published several important journals -  ''The Dragon-Fly'' (two issues - October 15, 1935, and May 15, 1936); and ''Leaves'' (two issues - Summer 1937; Winter 1938/39). [http://zinewiki.com/Leaves]. He was also proprietor of his imprint, the Dragon-Fly Press (Cassia, Florida) and under that imprint published two important works by members of the Lovecraft Circle - ''The Goblin Tower'' (the first verse collection by [[Frank Belknap Long]] – Lovecraft helped Barlow set the type for this) and "[[The Cats of Ulthar]]", a story by H. P. Lovecraft. [http://aok.lib.umbc.edu/specoll/popcul.php]

Barlow's fiction career was interrupted in 1937 by a variety of circumstances, including the death of his friend and mentor Lovecraft, and his own uprooting from Florida because of family troubles. In 1938 he edited Lovecraft's ''Notes and Commonplace Book'' and in 1939 edited ''After Sunset'' (John Howell, 1939), a collection of the best poems written by [[George Sterling]] in the last years before Sterling's suicide in 1926.

In 1943, Barlow lent assistance to the first bibliography of Lovecraft (by Francis T. Laney and William H. Evans). His poignant memoir of Lovecraft, "The Wind That is in the Grass" can be found in ''Marginalia'' (Arkham House, 1944). Barlow also contributed the introduction for the 1944 Arkham House volume ''Jumbee and Other Uncanny Tales'' by his fellow Floridian and ''[[Weird Tales]]'' author [[Henry S. Whitehead]].

===Sculptor===
Barlow was highly regarded as a sculptor, before his move into anthropology, and in one letter (to Clark Ashton Smith, May 16, 1937) he complained that people took this work more seriously than his writings. But it appears that none of his sculptural work has survived.

===Anthropologist===
Barlow moved permanently to Mexico around 1943, where he taught at several colleges, and in 1948 became chairman of the anthropology department at [[Mexico City College]] and a distinguished anthropologist of Indigenous Mesoamerican culture. He taught classes at Mexico City College, to mostly American students who were mostly there under funding from the post-war G.I. Bill.  The famous writer [[William S. Burroughs]], who lived in Mexico from 1950 to 1952, studied the [[Maya codices|Mayan Codices]] under Barlow in the first half of 1950.  Burroughs went on at least one field trip with him to the Temple of [[Quetzalcoatl]] in [[Teotihuacan]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Mayan symbolism and political structure he found there later featured heavily in Burroughs' fiction.

At the same time Barlow cooperated with Prof. [[Salvador Mateos Higuera]] in a descriptive study of Mexican codices. Within a brief three years he had cooperated with George T. Smisor to plan and edit ''Tlalocan'', a journal of source materials on native cultures of Mexico. Beginning in 1943 with the appearance of ''Tlalocan'' his productivity attained added momentum and his articles appeared with increasing frequency in the scholarly journals of Mexico, United States and Europe. Concern for minutiae led to such works of detail as "The 18th Century ''Relaciones Geograficas''".&lt;ref name=dibble/&gt;

He travelled to the Yucatán to study the Mayans, and to western Guerrero, where he studied the Tepuztecs. He founded two scholarly journals, and published around a hundred and fifty articles, pamphlets, and books.

In 1950 he published ''[[Mexihkatl itonalama]]'' ("The Mexican's [[tonalamatl|calendar]]"), a Nahuatl-language newspaper. His work in [[Mesoamerica]]n anthropology is of pioneering significance, and his collected anthropological papers are in the process of publication in Mexico.  At this time Barlow was also continuing his work a poet, writing both formalist verse and experimental verse of the Activist school pioneered by [[Lawrence Hart (poet)|Lawrence Hart]].

===Suicide===
Barlow had written as early as 1944 that he had "a subtle feeling that my curious and uneasy life is not destined to prolong itself".&lt;ref&gt;Joshi &amp; Schultz (2007): p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; He killed himself at his home in [[Azcapotzalco]], D.F, Mexico, on the first or second of January, 1951, apparently fearing the exposure of his [[homosexuality]] by a disgruntled student.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi &amp; Schultz (2007): p. yy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lovecraft: a Biography|author=L. Sprague de Camp|page=432|year=1975|isbn=0-385-00578-4|quote=... he was being blackmailed for his relations with Mexican youths.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that afternoon, he locked himself in his room, took 26 capsules of [[Seconal]], leaving pinned upon his door in Mayan pictographs "Do not disturb me. I want to sleep a long time."&lt;ref&gt; Lawrence Hart. ''Accent on Barlow: A Comemmorative [sic] Anthology'', San Rafael, CA, p. 9, 1962; quoted in Leon H. Abrams, Jr, ''Katunob'' 16 (1981), Greeley Co: Museum of Anthropology, University of North Colorado, 1981, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William S. Burroughs]], then studying Spanish, the Mexican codices and the Mayan language under Barlow, briefly described his death in a letter to [[Allen Ginsberg]], dated January 11: "A queer Professor from K.C., Mo., head of the Anthropology dept. here at M.C.C.  [Mexico City College] where I collect my $75 per month, knocked himself off a few days ago with overdose of [[barbiturate|goof balls]]. Vomit all over the bed. I can’t see this suicide kick."&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs (1993): pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[phonology]] of [[Sesotho]]''' and those of the other [[Sotho–Tswana languages]] are radically different from those of "older" or more "stereotypical" [[Bantu languages]]. Modern Sesotho in particular has very mixed origins (due to the influence of [[Difaqane]] refugees) inheriting many words and idioms from non-Sotho–Tswana languages.

There are in total 39 consonantal [[phoneme]]s&lt;ref name="lab_cons"&gt;Other authors may choose to include the [[#pp_labialization|labialized]] consonants as contrastive phonemes, potentially increasing the number by 26 to 75. Labialization does create [[minimal pair]]s, as is exemplified by the short [[Sesotho verbs#vbd passive|passive]] suffix, but different authors seem to be divided on whether or not these should be counted as authentic phonemes (especially since Sotho–Tswana-type labialization caused by vowel "absorption" is a fairly strange and rare process).

Besides the passives, there are still numerous minimal pairs differing only in the labialization of a single consonant (note that each of the following pairs has similar tonal patterns):
: {{IPA|[ʀɑlɑ]}} ''-rala'' ('design'), versus {{IPA|[ʀʷɑlɑ]}} ''-rwala'' ('carry on the head')
: {{IPA|[lɑlɑ]}} ''-lala'' ('lie down' [old fashioned or poetic]), versus {{IPA|[lʷɑlɑ]}} ''-lwala'' ('be sick' [old fashioned])
: {{IPA|[mʊʀɑ]}} ''mora'' ('son'), versus {{IPA|[mʊʀʷɑ]}} ''morwa'' ('a Khoisan person')
: {{IPA|[hɑmɑ]}} ''-hama'' ('milk an animal'), versus {{IPA|[hʷɑmɑ]}} ''-hwama'' ('[of fat] congeal')
: {{IPA|[t͡sʰɑsɑ]}} ''-tshasa'' ('smear'), versus {{IPA|[t͡sʰʷɑsɑ]}} ''-tshwasa'' ('capture prey')
: {{IPA|[mʊɬɑ]}} ''mohla'' ('day'), versus {{IPA|[mʊɬʷɑ]}} ''mohlwa'' ('termite')


Normal consonants and their labialised forms do not contrast before back vowels (that is, a labialized consonant will lose its labialization before a back vowel).&lt;/ref&gt; (plus 2 [[allophone]]s) and 9 vowel phonemes (plus two close raised allophones). The consonants include a rich set of [[affricate]]s and [[palatal consonant|palatal]] and [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] consonants, as well as three [[click consonant|click]] consonants.
&lt;!--
All 260 instances of the hover text match the regular expression:

This regex should work with most engines (it was tested with the Python re library), though you should probably escape the curly braces just to be on the safe side...
--&gt;
==Historical sound changes==
Probably the most radical sound innovation in the Sotho–Tswana languages is that the [[Proto-Bantu]] [[prenasalized consonant]]s have become simple stops and affricates.&lt;ref name="kintu_NC"&gt;The Sotho–Tswana ejective stops {{IPA|/pʼ/}}, {{IPA|/tʼ/}}, and {{IPA|/kʼ/}} come from the Proto-Bantu *mb, *nd, and *ŋg due to the radical effects of the nasalization process. The Proto-Bantu stops *p, *t, and *k have usually become {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}, and {{IPA|/x/}} ({{IPA|/ʀ/}} and {{IPA|/h/}} in modern Sesotho) with *kû becoming {{IPA|[fu]}}, and the nasalized forms of these (Proto-Bantu *mp, *nt, and *ŋk) are the two aspirated stops {{IPA|/pʰ/}} and {{IPA|/tʰ/}}, and the aspirated velar affricate {{IPA|/k͡xʰ/}} ({{IPA|/x/}} in most Sesotho speaking communities).

Note that some Sotho–Tswana languages do have prenasalized consonants, or at least have less strict and varied nasalization rules, but this is almost certainly as a result of influence from neighbouring non-Sotho–Tswana languages.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus [[isiZulu]] words such as ''e'''nt'''abeni'' ('on the mountain'), ''i'''mp'''uphu'' ('flour'), ''ezi'''nk'''ulu'' ('the big ones'), ''ukula'''nd'''a'' ('to fetch'), ''ukula'''mb'''a'' ('to become hungry'), and ''ukuthe'''ng'''a'' ('to buy') are [[cognate]]s to Sesotho {{IPA|[tʰɑbeŋ̩]}} '''''th'''abeng'', {{IPA|[pʰʊfʊ]}} '''''ph'''ofo'', {{IPA|[t͡sʼexʊlʊ]}} ''tse '''kg'''olo'', {{IPA|[hʊlɑtʼɑ]}} ''ho la'''t'''a'', {{IPA|[hʊlɑpʼɑ]}} ''ho la'''p'''a'', and {{IPA|[hʊʀɛkʼɑ]}} ''ho re'''k'''a'', respectively (with the same meanings).

This is further intensified by the law of [[#pp nasalization|nasalization]] and nasal homogeneity, making derived and imported words have syllabic nasals followed by homogeneous consonants, instead of prenasalized consonants.

Another important sound change in Sesotho which distinguishes it from almost all other Sotho–Tswana languages and dialects is the [[chain shift]] from {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/k͡xʰ/}} to {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/x/}} (the shift of {{IPA|/k͡xʰ/}} to {{IPA|/x/}} is not yet complete).

In certain respects, however, Sesotho is more conservative than other Sotho–Tswana languages. For example, the language still retains the difference in pronunciation between {{IPA|/ɬ/}}, {{IPA|/t͡ɬʰ/}}, and {{IPA|/tʰ/}}.&lt;ref name="hl_tlh"&gt;Strictly speaking, {{IPA|/t͡ɬʰ/}} should be an allophone of {{IPA|/ɬ/}} found only when {{IPA|/ɬ/}} is nasalized. However, possibly due to the mixed origins of Sesotho, there are several instances of {{IPA|/t͡ɬʰ/}} appearing without nasalization (as is the case in Setswana) or of {{IPA|/ɬ/}} failing to nasalize when the nasalizing consonant is not visible (such as when forming polysyllabic class 9 nouns).

Thus one finds:
: {{IPA|[hʊɬɑhɑ]}} ''ho hlaha'' ('to emerge') &gt; class 9 {{IPA|[t͡ɬʰɑhɔ]}} ''tlhaho'' ('nature')
: {{IPA|[hʊɬɔm̩pʰɑ]}} ''ho hlompha'' ('to respect') &gt; class 9 {{IPA|[ɬɔm̩pʰɔ]}} ''hlompho'' ('respect')
where the nasalization is applied in the first noun but not the second.
&lt;/ref&gt; Many other Sotho–Tswana languages have lost the fricative {{IPA|/ɬ/}}, and some Northern Sotho languages, possibly influenced by [[Tshivenda]], have also lost the lateral affricate and pronounce all three historical consonants as {{IPA|/tʰ/}} (they have also lost the distinction between {{IPA|/t͡ɬ/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} &amp;mdash; thus, for example, speakers of the Northern Sotho language commonly called Setlokwa call their language "Setokwa").&lt;ref name="loz_t"&gt;A further collapse occurred in [[Silozi]] &amp;mdash; which has lost the generally unusual distinction between plain and aspirated consonants. Thus Sesotho {{IPA|/ɬ/}}, {{IPA|/t͡ɬʼ/}}, {{IPA|/t͡ɬʰ/}}, {{IPA|/tʼ/}}, and {{IPA|/tʰ/}} all map to the single Silozi phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of (lightly) [[ejective consonant|ejective]] consonants (all unvoiced unaspirated [[stop consonant|stops]]) is very strange for a Bantu language and is thought to be due to Khoisan influence. These consonants occur in the Sotho–Tswana and Nguni languages (being over four times more common in Southern Africa than anywhere else in the world), and the ejective quality is strongest in [[isiXhosa]], which has been greatly influenced by Khoisan phonology.

As with most other Bantu languages, almost all palatal and postalveolar consonants are due to some form of [[#pp_palatalization|palatalization]] or other related phenomena which result from a (usually palatal) approximant or vowel being "absorbed" into another consonant (with a possible subsequent nasalization).

The Southern Bantu languages have lost the Bantu distinction between long and short vowels. In Sesotho the long vowels have simply been shortened without any other effects on the syllables; while sequences of two dissimilar vowels have usually resulted in the first vowel being "absorbed" into the preceding consonant, and causing changes such as labialization and palatalization.

As with most Southern African Bantu languages, the "composite" or "secondary" vowels *e and *o have become {{IPA|/ɛ, e/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ, o/}}. These usually behave as two phonemes (conditioned by [[vowel harmony]]), although there are enough exceptions to justify the claim that they have become four separate phonemes in the Sotho–Tswana languages.

Additionally, the first-degree (or "superclose", "heavy") and second-degree vowels have not merged as in many other Bantu languages, resulting in a total of 9 phonemic vowels.

Almost uniquely among the Sotho–Tswana languages, Sesotho has adopted clicks.&lt;ref&gt;Urban varieties of [[Pedi language|Pedi]] are currently acquiring clicks as well.&lt;/ref&gt; There is one place of articulation, [[alveolar click|alveolar]], and three manners and phonations: tenuis, aspirated, and nasalized. These most probably came with loanwords from the [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] and [[Nguni languages]], though they also exist in various words which don't exist in these languages and in various ideophones.

These clicks also appear in environments which are rare or non-existent in the Nguni and Khoisan languages, such as a syllabic nasal followed by a nasalized click ({{IPA|[ŋ̩ǃn]}} written {{angbr|nnq}}, as in {{IPA|[ŋ̩ǃnɑnɪ]}} ''nnqane'' 'that other side'), a syllabic nasal followed by a tenuis click ({{IPA|[ŋ̩ǃ]}}, also written {{angbr|nq}}, as in {{IPA|[sɪŋ̩ǃɑŋ̩ǃɑnɪ]}} ''senqanqane'' 'frog'; this is not the same as the prenasalized radical click written {{angbr|nkq}} in the Nguni languages),{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} and a syllabic nasal followed by an aspirated click ({{IPA|[ŋ̩ǃʰ]}} written {{angbr|nqh}}, as in {{IPA|[sɪǃʰɪŋ̩ǃʰɑ]}} ''seqhenqha'' 'hunk').

==Vowels==

Sesotho has a large inventory of vowels compared with many other Bantu languages. However, the nine [[phoneme|phonemic]] vowels are collapsed into only five letters in the [[Sesotho orthography]]. The two close vowels ''i'' and ''u'' (sometimes called "superclose" or "first-degree" by Bantuists) are very high (with advanced tongue root) and are better approximated by French vowels than English vowels. That is especially true for {{IPA|/u/}}, which, in English, is often noticeably more front and can be transcribed as {{IPA|[u̟]}} or {{IPA|[ʉ]}} in the IPA; that is absent from Sesotho (and French).

==Consonants==
The Sotho–Tswana languages are peculiar among the Bantu family in that most do not have any [[prenasalized consonant]]s and have a rather-large number of heterorganic compounds. Sesotho, uniquely among the recognised and standardised Sotho–Tswana languages&lt;!--I hear that Sekgalagadi also has clicks??--&gt;, also has [[click consonant]]s, which were acquired from Khoisan and Nguni languages.

# {{IPA|[d]}} is an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/l/}}, occurring only before the close vowels ({{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}). Dialectical evidence shows that in the Sotho–Tswana languages {{IPA|/l/}} was originally pronounced as a [[retroflex flap]] {{IPA|[ɽ]}}&lt;!-- the Wikipedia articles on flaps and taps seem awfully confused, so I won't link to the topic --&gt; before the two close vowels.

Sesotho makes a three-way distinction between lightly [[ejective consonant|ejective]], [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and [[voiced consonant|voiced]] [[stop consonant|stops]] in several [[place of articulation|places of articulation]].

Sesotho possesses four simple [[nasal stop|nasal consonants]]. All of these can be [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] and the syllabic velar nasal may also appear at the end of words.

Note that when {{angbr|w}} appears as part of a [[syllable onset]] this actually indicates that the consonant is [[#pp labialization|labialized]].

The following [[fricatives]] occur. The glottal fricative is often voiced between vowels, making it barely noticeable.&lt;ref name="inv_cons"&gt;There are many historical instances in Sesotho which show an occasional confusion between the phonemes {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/ɦ/}}, and (no consonant). For example, the verb {{IPA|[ɑhɑ]}} ''-aha'' ('build') often appears as {{IPA|[hɑhɑ]}} ''-haha'' (cf. Silozi ''-yaha''), though comparison with other languages (Setswana ''-aga'', Nguni ''-akha'', etc.) reveals its true form.

Other examples include the changing of the original verbal focus marker *-ya- to {{IPA|[ɑ]}} ''-a-''; the second person singular objectival concord ({{IPA|[ʊ]}} ''-o-'', but Setswana ''-go-'' and Nguni ''-ku-''); the verb {{IPA|[lɑjɑ]}} ''-laya'' ('to correct'); its Proto-Bantu form *-dag- should have given {{IPA|[lɑˈɑ]}} ''-laa'', which does occur as a variant); verbs which end in the form {{IPA|[ijɑ]}} ''-iya'' (e.g. {{IPA|[sijɑ]}} ''-siya'' 'leave behind', {{IPA|[dijɑ]}} ''-diya'' 'cause to fall', etc.) being alternatively rendered as {{IPA|[iˈɑ]}} ''-ia''; {{IPA|[lɪˈɪ]}} ''lee'' (egg; Proto-Bantu *di-gi) often appearing as {{IPA|[lɪhɪ]}} ''lehe''; etc. It should also be noted that many [[Sesotho verbs#Verbal derivatives|verbal derivatives]] treat verbs ending with {{IPA|[jɑ]}} ''-ya'' as if they end with {{IPA|[ɑ]}} ''-a'' (that is, the suffix replaces the entire {{IPA|[jɑ]}} ''-ya'', not just the final {{IPA|[ɑ]}} ''-a'').&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative orthography used for the velar fricative is due to some loanwords from Afrikaans and ideophones which were historically pronounced with velar fricatives, distinct from the velar affricate. The voiced postalveolar affricative sometimes occurs as an alternative to the fricative.

There is one [[trill consonant]]. Originally, this was an alveolar rolled lingual, but today most individuals pronounce it at the back of the tongue, usually at the uvular position. The uvular pronunciation is largely attributed to the influence of [[French language|French]] [[missionaries]] at [[Morija]] in [[Lesotho]]. Just like the French version, the position of this consonant is somewhat unstable and often varies even in individuals, but it generally differs from the "r"'s of most other South African language communities. The most stereotypical French-like pronunciations are found in certain rural areas of Lesotho, as well as some areas of [[Soweto]] (where this has affected the pronunciation of [[Tsotsitaal]]).

Sesotho has a relatively large number of [[affricate consonant|affricate]]s. The velar affricate, which was standard in Sesotho until the early 20th century, now only occurs in some communities as an alternative to the more common velar fricative.&lt;ref name="velar_fric_affric"&gt;In Setswana and most Northern Sotho languages these are two different phonemes. The Setswana velar fricative corresponds to the Sesotho glottal fricative, and the velar affricate corresponds to the Sesotho velar fricative/affricate, but before the close vowel {{IPA|/u/}} ''u'' Setswana regularly uses the unvoiced glottal fricative.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[click consonant]]s occur.&lt;ref name="click_accomp"&gt;For completeness, this table uses a narrower (more detailed) transcription of clicks than usual in Bantu languages, but the rest of this article and other articles in the series use the less detailed system of click transcription. See the full consonant table above to see the usual transcriptions.&lt;/ref&gt; In common speech they are sometimes substituted with dental clicks. Even in standard Sesotho the nasal click is usually substituted with the tenuis click. {{angbr|nq}} is also used to indicate a syllabic nasal followed by an ejective click ({{IPA|/ŋ̩ǃkʼ/}}), while {{angbr|nnq}} is used for a syllabic nasal followed by a nasal click ({{IPA|/ŋ̩ǃŋ/}}).

The following heterorganic compounds occur. They are often substituted with other consonants, although there are a few instances when some of them are phonemic and not just allophonic. These are not considered [[consonant cluster]]s.

In non-standard speech these may be pronounced in a variety of ways. ''bj'' may be pronounced {{IPA|/bj/}} (followed by a palatal glide) and ''pj'' may be pronounced {{IPA|/pjʼ/}}. ''pj'' may also sometimes be pronounced {{IPA|/ptʃʼ/}}, which may alternatively be written ''ptj'', though this is not to be considered standard.

==Syllable structure==

Sesotho syllables tend to be [[open syllable|open]], with syllabic nasals and the syllabic approximant ''l'' also allowed. Unlike almost all other Bantu languages, Sesotho does not have prenasalized consonants (NC).

#The [[syllable onset|onset]] may be any consonant (C), a [[#pp_labialization|labialized]] consonant (Cw), an approximant (A), or a vowel (V).
#The [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] may be a vowel, a syllabic nasal (N), or the syllabic ''l'' (L).
#No [[syllable coda|codas]] are allowed.

The possible syllables are:
*V ''ho '''e'''tsa'' ('to do') {{IPA|[hʊˈet͡sʼɑ]}}
*CV '''''fi'''!'' ('ideophone of sudden darkness') {{IPA|[fi]}}
*CwV ''ho '''tswa''''' ('to emerge') {{IPA|[hʊt͡sʼʷɑ]}}
*AV  '''''we'''na'' ('you') {{IPA|[wɛnɑ]}}
*N '''''n'''na'' ('I') {{IPA|[n̩nɑ]}}
*L ''lebo'''l'''lo'' ('circumcision rite') {{IPA|[lɪbʊl̩lɔ]}}
Note that heterorganic compounds count as single consonants, not consonant clusters.

Additionally, the following [[phonotactic]] restrictions apply:
#A consonant may not be followed by the palatal approximant {{IPA|/j/}} (i.e. C+''y'' is not a valid onset).&lt;ref name="palat_approx"&gt;Historically, in various Bantu languages, this has resulted in palatalization (giving the postalveolar and palatal consonants) and the alveolar fricative {{IPA|/s/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Neither the labio-velar approximant {{IPA|/w/}} nor a labialized consonant may not be followed by a back vowel at any time.

Syllabic ''l'' occurs only due to a vowel being [[#pp_elision|elided]] between two ''l'''s:
: {{IPA|[mʊlɪlɔ]}} *''molelo'' (Proto-Bantu *mu-dido) &gt; {{IPA|[mʊl̩lɔ]}} ''mollo'' ('fire') (cf [[Setswana]] ''molelo'', [[isiZulu]] ''umlilo'')
: {{IPA|[hʊlɪlɑ]}} *''ho lela'' (Proto-Bantu *-dida) &gt; {{IPA|[hʊl̩lɑ]}} ''ho lla'' ('to cry') (cf [[Setswana]] ''go lela'', [[isiXhosa]] ''ukulila'', [[Tshivenda]] ''u lila'')
: isiZulu ''ukuphuma'' ('to emerge') &gt; ''ukuphumelela'' ('to succeed') &gt; Sesotho {{IPA|[hʊpʰʊmɛl̩lɑ]}} ''ho phomella''

There are no contrastive long vowels in Sesotho, the rule being that juxtaposed vowels form separate syllables (which may sound like long vowels with undulating tones during natural fast speech).&lt;ref name="glot_stop"&gt;This is not to say that the [[glottal stop]] is part of the phoneme inventory of Sesotho, nor is it correct to say that the language has [[diphthongs]] or [[triphthongs]] (or even longer: {{IPA|[hɑˈʊˈɑˈiˌˈut͡ɬʼʷɑ]}} ''h'''a o a e u'''tlwa'' 'you did not hear it'). Sequences of vowels may be pronounced with [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] (thus they are not diphthongs), but in fast speech they may simply flow into each other (thus the glottal stop is not a contrastive phoneme).&lt;/ref&gt; Originally there might have been a consonant between vowels which was eventually elided that prevented coalescence or other phonological processes (Proto-Bantu *g, and sometimes *j).

Other Bantu languages have rules against vowel juxtaposition, often inserting an intermediate approximant if necessary.
: Sesotho {{IPA|[xɑˈutʼeŋ̩]}} ''G'''au'''teng'' ('[[Gauteng]]') &gt; isiXhosa ''Erh'''awu'''deni''

==Phonological processes==

Vowels and consonants very often influence one another resulting in predictable sound changes. Most of these changes are either vowels changing vowels, nasals changing consonants, or approximants changing consonants. The sound changes are [[#pp nasalization|nasalization]], [[#pp palatalization|palatalization]], [[#pp alveolarization|alveolarization]], [[#pp velarization|velarization]], vowel [[#pp elision|elision]], [[#pp vowel raising|vowel raising]], and [[#pp labialization|labialization]]. Sesotho nasalization and vowel-raising are extra-strange since, unlike most processes in most languages, they actually ''decrease'' the [[sonorant|sonority]] of the phonemes.

{{Anchor|pp_nasalization}}

'''Nasalization''' (alternatively Nasal permutation or Strengthening) is a process in Bantu languages by which, in certain circumstances, a prefixed nasal becomes assimilated to a succeeding consonant and causes changes in the form of the phone to which it is prefixed. In the [[Sesotho language]] series of articles it is indicated by {{angbr|N}}.

In Sesotho it is a [[fortition]] process and usually occurs in the formation of class 9 and 10 nouns, in the use of the [[Sesotho concords#con objectival|objectival concord]] of the first person singular, in the use of the [[Sesotho concords#con adjectival|adjectival]] and [[Sesotho concords#con enumerative|enumerative concords]] of some noun classes, and in the forming of reflexive verbs (with the [[Sesotho concords#pre reflexive|reflexive prefix]]).

Very roughly speaking, voiced consonants become devoiced and fricatives (except {{IPA|/x/}} &lt;ref name="kg_nasal"&gt;Historically {{IPA|/x/}} ({{angbr|kg}} was an affricate {{IPA|[k͡xʰ]}} (this still appears as a variation) and was therefore not an exception.

Some individuals nasalize {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/h/}} to {{IPA|/kʰ/}} (possibly by analogy with the Setswana ''hu'' nasalizing to ''khu'') and sometimes even {{IPA|/kʼ/}} (perhaps due to the unstable nature of the voiced {{IPA|[ɦ]}}, which is barely audible and may cause the syllable to sound as if it does not have an onset). Though this is certainly not to be considered standard, it is an understandable reaction to the frication ("weakening") of the affricate {{IPA|[k͡xʰ]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) lose their fricative quality.

Vowels and the approximant {{IPA|/w/}} get a {{IPA|/kʼ/}} in front of them&lt;ref name="y_no_y_nasal"&gt;Strangely, there are no polysyllabic verbs beginning with {{IPA|/j/}}. The verb ''-ya'' {{IPA|[jɑ]}} cannot be used with an objectival concord (it may have an intransitive, locative, or instrumental [[Sesotho verbs#vb import|import]] and an idiomatic passive, but is not transitive) and the approximant is removed in verbal derivations. There are also no adjectives beginning with {{IPA|/y/}} or any other parts of speech which may be nasalized, so there are no instances of {{IPA|/j/}} being nasalized.

Note that if a {{IPA|/j/}} were to nasalize by getting a {{IPA|/kʼ/}} in front of it, the phonotactic restrictions and phonetic rules of the language would not allow the combination *{{IPA|/kʼj/}}. In [[Silozi]], which has many verbs with word-initial {{IPA|/j/}} (many of which correspond to Sesotho vowel verbs), nasalization of {{IPA|/y/}} results in {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}, which has collapsed from original Sotho–Tswana {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, {{IPA|/t͡ʃʼ/}}, and {{IPA|/t͡ʃʰ/}}. Since nasalization removes voicing and frication (and Sesotho palatalization preserves aspiration), one may then deduce that if Sesotho {{IPA|/j/}} were to nasalize it would most probably become {{IPA|/t͡ʃʼ/}} ''tj''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Voiced stops become ejective:
*: {{IPA|/b/}} &gt; {{IPA|/pʼ/}} 
*: {{IPA|/l/}} &gt; {{IPA|/tʼ/}} 
*Fricatives become aspirated:
*: {{IPA|/f/}} &gt; {{IPA|/pʰ/}}
*: {{IPA|/ʀ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/tʰ/}}
*: {{IPA|/s/}} &gt; {{IPA|/t͡sʰ/}}
*: {{IPA|/ʃ/}}  &gt; {{IPA|/t͡ʃʰ/}}
*: {{IPA|/ɬ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/t͡ɬʰ/}} (except with adjectives)
*{{IPA|/h/}} becomes {{IPA|/x/}}
*{{IPA|/ʒ/}} becomes {{IPA|/t͡ʃʼ/}}

The syllabic nasal causing the change is usually dropped, except for monosyllabic stems and the first person objectival concord. Reflexive verbs don't show a nasal.

: {{IPA|[hʊˈɑʀbɑ]}} ''ho araba'' ('to answer') &gt; {{IPA|[kʼɑʀɑbɔ]}} ''karabo'' ('response'), {{IPA|[hʊŋ̩kʼɑʀɑbɑ]}} ''ho nkaraba'' ('to answer me'), and {{IPA|[huˌˈikʼɑʀɑbɑ]}} ''ho ikaraba'' ('to answer oneself')
: {{IPA|[hʊfɑ]}} ''ho fa'' ('to give') &gt; {{IPA|[m̩pʰɔ]}} ''mpho'' ('gift'), {{IPA|[hʊm̩pʰɑ]}} ''ho mpha'' ('to give me'), and {{IPA|[huˌˈipʰɑ]}} ''ho ipha'' ('to give oneself')

Other changes may occur due to contractions in verb derivations:
: {{IPA|[hʊbɔnɑ]}} ''ho bona'' ('to see') &gt; {{IPA|[hʊbon̩t͡sʰɑ]}} ''ho bontsha'' ('to cause to see') ([[Sesotho verbs#vbd causative|causative]] {{IPA|[bɔn]}} ''-bon-'' + {{IPA|[isɑ]}} ''-isa'')

'''Nasal homogeneity''' consists of two points:
#When a consonant is preceded by a (visible or invisible) nasal it will undergo nasalization, if it supports it.
#When a nasal is immediately followed by another consonant with no vowel betwixt them, the nasal will change to a nasal in the same approximate position as the following consonant, after the consonant has undergone nasal permutation. If the consonant is already a nasal then the previous nasal will simply change to the same.

{{Anchor|pp palatalization}}
----

'''Palatalization''' is a process in certain Bantu languages where a consonant becomes a palatal consonant.

In Sesotho it usually occurs with the short form of [[Sesotho verbs#vbd passive|passive]] verbs and the diminutives of nouns, adjectives, and relatives.

*Labials:
*: {{IPA|/pʼ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/pʃʼ/}} / {{IPA|/t͡ʃʼ/}}
*: {{IPA|/pʰ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/pʃʰ/}} / {{IPA|/t͡ʃʰ/}}
*: {{IPA|/b/}} &gt; {{IPA|/bʒ/}} / {{IPA|/ʒ/}}
*: {{IPA|/f/}} &gt; {{IPA|/fʃ/}} / {{IPA|/ʃ/}}
*Alveolars:
*: {{IPA|/tʼ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/t͡ʃʼ/}}
*: {{IPA|/tʰ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/t͡ʃʰ/}}
*: {{IPA|/l/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ʒ/}}
*The nasals become {{IPA|/ɲ/}}:
*: {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/m/}}, and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɲ/}}

For example:
: {{IPA|[hʊlɪfɑ]}} ''ho lefa'' ('to pay') &gt; {{IPA|[hʊlɪfʃʷɑ]}} ''ho lefjwa'' / {{IPA|[hʊlɪʃʷɑ]}} ''ho leshwa'' ('to be paid')
{{Anchor|pp alveolarization}}
----

'''Alveolarization''' is a process whereby a consonant becomes an alveolar consonant. It occurs in noun diminutives, the diminutives of [[Sesotho parts of speech#Colour adjectives|colour adjectives]], and in the pronouns and concords of noun classes with a {{IPA|[di]}} ''di-'' or {{IPA|[di]}} ''di[N]-'' prefix. This results in either {{IPA|/t͡sʼ/}} or {{IPA|/t͡sʰ/}}.

*{{IPA|/pʼ/}}, {{IPA|/b/}}, and {{IPA|/l/}} become {{IPA|/t͡sʼ/}}
*{{IPA|/pʰ/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}, and {{IPA|/ʀ/}} become {{IPA|/t͡sʰ/}} 

Examples:
: {{IPA|[xʷɑdi]}} ''-kgwadi'' ('black with white spots') &gt; {{IPA|[xʷɑt͡sʼɑnɑ]}} ''-kgwatsana'' (diminutive)
: {{IPA|[dikʼet͡sʼɔ&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;t͡sʼɑhɑˈʊ]}} ''diketso tsa hao'' ('your actions')

Other changes may occur due to phonological interactions in [[Sesotho verbs#Verbal derivatives|verbal derivatives]]:
: {{IPA|[hʊbʊt͡sʼɑ]}} ''ho botsa'' ('to ask') &gt; {{IPA|[hʊbʊt͡sʼet͡sʼɑ]}} ''ho botsetsa'' ('to ask on behalf of') ([[Sesotho verbs#vbd applied|applied]] {{IPA|[bʊt͡sʼ]}} ''-bots-'' + {{IPA|[ɛlɑ]}} ''-ela'')

The alveolarization which changes Sesotho {{IPA|/l/}} to {{IPA|/t͡sʼ/}} is by far the most commonly applied phonetic process in the language. It's regularly applied in the formation of some class 8 and 10 concords and in numerous verbal derivatives.

{{Anchor|pp velarization}}
----

'''Velarization''' in Sesotho is a process whereby certain sounds become velar consonants due to the intrusion of an approximant. It occurs with verb passives, noun diminutives, the diminutives of relatives, and the formation of some class 1 and 3 prefixes.

*{{IPA|/m/}} becomes {{IPA|/ŋ/}}
*{{IPA|/ɲ/}} becomes {{IPA|/ŋ̩ŋ/}}&lt;ref name="strange_nng"&gt;This second change is very strange and does not occur in most other major Sotho–Tswana languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
: {{IPA|[hʊsɪɲɑ]}} ''ho senya'' ('to destroy') &gt; {{IPA|[hʊsɪŋ̩ŋʷɑ]}} ''ho senngwa'' ('to be destroyed') (short passive {{IPA|[sɪɲ]}} ''-seny-'' + {{IPA|[wɑ]}} ''-wa'')
: Class 1 {{IPA|[mʊ]}} ''mo-'' + {{IPA|[ɑhɑ]}} ''-aha'' &gt; {{IPA|[ŋʷɑhɑ]}} ''ngwaha'' ('year') (cf Kiswahili ''mwaka''; from Proto-Bantu *-jaka)

{{Anchor|pp elision}}
----
'''Elision''' of vowels occurs in Sesotho less often than in those Bantu languages which have vowel "pre-prefixes" before the noun class prefixes (such as isiZulu), but there are still instances where it regularly and actively occurs.

There are two primary types of regular vowel elision:
#The vowels {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, and {{IPA|/ʊ/}} may be removed from between two instances of {{IPA|/l/}}, thereby causing the first {{IPA|/l/}} to become syllabic. This actively occurs with verbs, and has historically occurred with some nouns.
#When forming class 1 or 3 nouns from noun stems beginning with {{IPA|/b/}} the middle {{IPA|/ʊ/}} is removed and the {{IPA|/b/}} is contracted into the {{IPA|/m/}}, resulting in {{IPA|[m̩m]}}. This actively occurs with nouns derived from verbs commencing with {{IPA|[b]}} and has historically occurred with many other nouns.

For example:
: {{IPA|[bɑlɑ]}} ''-bala'' ('read') &gt; {{IPA|[bɑl̩lɑ]}} ''-balla'' ([[Sesotho verbs#vbd applied|applied]] verb suffix {{IPA|[ɛlɑ]}} ''-ela'') ('read for'), and {{IPA|[m̩mɑdi]}} ''mmadi'' ('person who reads')
{{Anchor|pp_vowel_raising}}
----

'''Vowel raising''' is an uncommon form of [[vowel harmony]] where a non-open vowel (i.e. any vowel other than {{IPA|/ɑ/}}) is raised in position by a following vowel (in the same phonological word) at a higher position. The first variety &amp;mdash; in which the open-mid vowels become close-mid &amp;mdash; is commonly found in most Southern African Bantu languages (where the Proto-Bantu "mixed" vowels have separated). In the 9-vowel Sotho–Tswana languages, a much less common process also occurs where the near-close vowels become raised to a position slightly lower than the close vowels (closer to the English b'''ea'''t and b'''oo'''t than the very high Sesotho vowels ''i'' and ''u'') without [[advanced tongue root|ATR]] (or, alternatively, with both [+ATR] ''and'' [+[[retracted tongue root|RTR]]]).
&lt;hr width = "25%"&gt;
'''Mid vowel raising''' is a process where {{IPA|/ɛ/}} becomes {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} becomes {{IPA|/o/}} under the influence of close vowels or consonants that contain "hidden" close vowels.

{{Listen|filename=Sesotho_pp_mid_raising.ogg|title=Vowel raising of the open-mid vowels|description=Audio sample of the examples|format=[[Ogg]]}}

: ''ho k'''e'''na''&lt;sup class="noprint" title="Included in audio sample"&gt;[[#audio note|‡]]&lt;/sup&gt; ('to enter') {{IPA|[hʊkʼɛnɑ]}} &gt; ''ho k'''eny'''a''&lt;sup class="noprint" title="Included in audio sample"&gt;[[#audio note|‡]]&lt;/sup&gt; ('to insert') {{IPA|[hʊkʼeɲɑ]}}

These changes are usually recursive to varying depths within the word, though, being a left spreading rule, it is often bounded by the difficulty of "foreseeing" the raising syllable:
: ''diphoof'''o'''l'''o'''''&lt;sup class="noprint" title="Included in audio sample"&gt;[[#audio_note|‡]]&lt;/sup&gt; ('animals') {{IPA|[dipʰɔˈɔfɔlɔ]}} &gt; ''diphoof'''o'''l'''ong'''''&lt;sup class="noprint" title="Included in audio sample"&gt;[[#audio note|‡]]&lt;/sup&gt; ('by the animals') {{IPA|[dipʰɔˈɔfoloŋ̩]}}

Additionally, a right-spreading form occurs when a close-mid vowel is on the penultimate syllable (that is, the stressed syllable) and, due to some inflection or derivational process, is followed by an open-mid vowel. In this case the vowel on the final syllable is raised. This does not happen if the penultimate syllable is close ({{IPA|/i/}} or ({{IPA|/u/}}).

: ''-besa'' ('roast') {{IPA|[besɑ]}} &gt; subjunctive ''ke bese'' ('so I may roast...') {{IPA|[kʼɪbese]}}
but
: ''-thola'' ('find') {{IPA|[tʰɔlɑ]}} &gt; subjunctive ''ke thole'' ('so I may find...') {{IPA|[kʼɪtʰɔlɛ]}}

These vowels can occur phonemically, however, and may thus be considered to be separate phonemes:
: ''ma'''e'''l'''e''''' ('wisdom') {{IPA|[mɑˈele]}}
: ''ho r'''e'''tla'' ('to dismantle') {{IPA|[hʊʀet͡ɬʼɑ]}}
&lt;hr width = "25%"&gt;
'''Close vowel raising''' is a process which occurs under much less common circumstances. Near-close {{IPA|/ɪ/}} becomes {{IPA|[iˌ]}}&lt;ref name="non_s_clos_r_v" /&gt; and near-close {{IPA|/ʊ/}} becomes {{IPA|[uˌ]}}&lt;ref name="non_s_clos_r_v"&gt;The symbols used in this and related articles for the raised allophones of the near-close vowels are non-standard, though there really aren't any standard alternatives...

The difficulty lies in acknowledging the role of ATR in this process. In the past, when they were recognised at all, they were often viewed as simply an extra vowel height, and the choice of symbols differed between authors since standard IPA does not recognise the possibility of so many contrastive close vowel heights.&lt;/ref&gt; when immediately followed by a syllable containing the close vowels {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/u/}}. Unlike the mid vowel raising this processes is not iterative and is only caused directly by the close vowels (it cannot be caused by any hidden vowels or by other raised vowels).

Since these changes are allophonic, the Sotho–Tswana languages are rarely said to have 11 vowels.

{{Anchor|pp labialization}}
----

'''[[Labialization]]''' is a modification of a consonant due to the action of a bilabial {{IPA|/w/}} element which persists throughout the articulation of the consonant and is not merely a following semivowel. This labialization results in the consonant being pronounced with rounded lips&lt;ref name="lip_shaping"&gt;In Sesotho, when a consonant is followed by a vowel, the shape of the lips is changed to resemble the shape of the vowel while the consonant is being pronounced (or even before, when the syllable is the first after a pause) with the shaping being more severe the higher the vowel height. Thus, when a consonant is followed by a back vowel the lips are rounded when pronouncing the consonant, and the lips are spread when pronouncing a consonant followed by a front vowel. Labialization may be explained by saying that, for some reason, the lips are rounded in anticipation of a back vowel that is never pronounced.

This also explains why labialization disappears before back vowels. Since the lips will already be rounded anyway in anticipation of the following vowel, there is no way to distinguish between a labialized consonant before a back vowel and a normal consonant before a back vowel (this is similar to the situation in English where {{IPAslink|hw}} &amp;mdash; written as {{angbr|[[wh (digraph)|wh]]}} &amp;mdash; is pronounced {{IPA|/h/}} in words such as ''whom'', ''whole'', and ''whore'').

Note that it is also possible for labialization to simply disappear, even if any other modification of the consonant caused as a side-effect of labialization remains. One example is the tentative evolution of modern Sesotho {{IPA|[ɲ̩t͡ʃʼɑ]}} ''ntja'' ('dog') from Proto-Bantu *N-bua:
: Proto-Bantu *N-bua &gt; (nasal homogeneity) *{{IPA|m̩bua}} &gt; (labialization) *{{IPA|m̩bʷa}} &gt; (palatalization) *{{IPA|m̩pʃʷa}} &gt; (loss of labialization + gaining of ejective quality) *{{IPA|m̩pʃʼa}} (as found in Northern Sotho) &gt; (heterorganic simplification + nasal homogeneity) modern {{IPA|[ɲ̩t͡ʃʼɑ]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (but, in Sesotho, with no velarization) and with attenuated high frequencies (especially noticeable with fricatives and aspirated consonants).

It may be traced to an original {{IPA|/ʊ/}} or {{IPA|/u/}} being "absorbed" into the preceding consonant when the syllable is followed by another vowel. The consonant is labialized and the transition from the labialized [[syllable onset]] to the [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] vowel sounds like a bilabial semivowel (or, alternatively, like a [[diphthong]]). Unlike in languages such as [[Chishona]] and [[Tshivenda]], Sesotho labialization does not result in "whistling" of any consonants.

Almost all consonants may be labialized (indicated in the orthography by following the symbol with {{angbr|w}}), the exceptions being labial stops and fricatives (which become [[#pp palatalization|palatalized]]), the bilabial and palatal nasals (which become [[#pp velarization|velarized]]), and the voiced alveolar {{IPA|[d]}} allophone of {{IPA|/l/}} (which would become [[#pp alveolarization|alveolarized]] instead). Additionally, syllabic nasals (where [[#pp nasalization|nasalization]] results in a labialized {{IPA|[ŋ̩kʼ]}} instead) and the syllabic {{IPA|/l/}} (which is always followed by the non-syllabic {{IPA|/l/}}) are never directly labialized. Note that the unvoiced heterorganic doubled articulant fricative {{IPA|/fʃ/}} only occurs labialized (only as {{IPA|[fʃʷ]}}).

Due to the inherent bilabial semivowel, labialized consonants never appear before back vowels:
: {{IPA|[hʊlɑt͡sʼʷɑ]}} ''ho latswa'' ('to taste') &gt; {{IPA|[tʼɑt͡sʼɔ]}} ''tatso'' ('flavour')
: {{IPA|[hʊt͡sʼʷɑ]}} ''ho tswa'' ('to emerge') &gt; {{IPA|[lɪt͡sʼɔ]}} ''letso'' ('a [[morphological derivation|derivation]]')
: {{IPA|[hʊnʷɑ]}} ''ho nwa'' ('to drink') &gt; {{IPA|[sɪnɔ]}} ''seno'' ('a beverage')
: {{IPA|[hʊˈɛlɛl̩lʷɑ]}} ''ho elellwa'' ('to realise') &gt; {{IPA|[kʼɛlɛl̩lɔ]}} ''kelello'' ('the mind')

==Tonology==
{{Main|Sesotho tonology}}
Sesotho is a [[tonal language]] spoken using two contrasting tones: low and high; further investigation reveals, however, that in reality it is only the high tones that are explicitly specified on the syllables in the speaker's mental lexicon, and that low tones appear when a syllable is tonally under-specified. Unlike the tonal systems of languages such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], where each syllable basically has an immutable tone, the tonal systems of the [[Niger–Congo languages]] are much more complex in that several "tonal rules" are used to manipulate the underlying high tones before the words may be spoken, and this includes special rules ("melodies") which, like grammatical or syntax rules that operate on words and [[morpheme]]s, may change the tones of specific words depending on the meaning one wishes to convey.

==Stress==

The [[stress (linguistics)|word stress]] system of Sesotho (often called "penultimate lengthening" instead, though there are certain situations where it doesn't fall on the penultimate syllable) is quite simple. Each complete [[Sesotho grammar#The Sesotho word|Sesotho word]] has exactly one main stressed syllable.

Except for the second form of the first [[Sesotho parts of speech#Demonstrative pronouns|demonstrative pronoun]], certain formations involving certain enclitics, polysyllabic ideophones, most compounds, and a handful of other words, there is only one main stress falling on the [[penult]].

The stressed syllable is slightly longer and has a falling tone. Unlike in English, stress does not affect vowel quality or height.

This type of stress system occurs in most of those Eastern and Southern Bantu languages which have lost contrastive vowel length.

The second form of the first demonstrative pronoun has the stress on the final syllable. Some proclitics can leave the stress of the original word in place, causing the resultant word to have the stress at the antepenultimate syllable (or even earlier, if the enclitics are compounded). Ideophones, which tend to not obey the phonetic laws which the rest of the language abides by, may also have irregular stress.

There is even at least one [[minimal pair]]: the adverb ''fela'' ('only') {{IPA|[ˈfɛlɑ]}} has regular stress, while the conjunctive  ''fela'' ('but') {{IPA|[fɛˈlɑ]}} (like many other conjunctives) has stress on the final syllable. This is certainly not enough evidence to justify making the claim that Sesotho is a stress accent language, though.

Because the stress falls on the penultimate syllable, Sesotho, like other Bantu languages (and unlike many closely allied Niger–Congo languages), tends to avoid monosyllabic words and often employs certain prefixes and suffixes to make the word disyllabic (such as the syllabic nasal in front of class 9 nouns with monosyllabic stems, etc.).

[[Speech technology|Speech interface]] system has many advantages such as consistent service and saving cost. However, for users, listening is a difficult task. It can become impossible when too many options are provided at once. This may mean that a user cannot intuitively reach a decision. To avoid this problem, limit options and a few clear choices the developer should consider such difficulties are usually provided. The guideline suggests the solution which is able to satisfy the users (customers). The goal of the guideline is to make an automated [[Transaction processing|transaction]] at least as attractive and efficient as interacting with an attendant.

{{wiktionary|sprachraum|sprachgebiet}}
In [[linguistics]], a '''sprachraum''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|p|r|ɑː|k|r|aʊ|m}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʃpʁaːxˌʁaʊm|lang}}, "language space") is a [[geography|geographical]] region where a common [[first language]] (mother tongue), with [[dialect]] varieties, or [[language family|group of languages]] is spoken.

==Characteristics==
Most sprachraums do not follow national [[border]]s.  For example, half of [[South America]] is part of the Spanish sprachraum, while a single, small country like [[Switzerland]] is at the intersection of [[Languages of Switzerland|three such language spheres]]. A sprachraum can also be separated by oceans.
  
The four major Western sprachraums are those of English, Spanish, Portuguese and French (according to the number of speakers).  The English sprachraum ([[Anglosphere]]) spans the globe, from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] to the many former British colonies where English has official language status alongside local languages, such as [[India]] and [[South Africa]]. The French sprachraum, which also has area on several [[continent]]s, is known as the [[Francophonie]] ({{lang-fr|La francophonie}}). [[La Francophonie]] is also the name of an international organisation composed of countries with French as an official language. 

The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] sprachraum or [[Geographic distribution of Portuguese|Lusosphere or Lusophony]] ({{lang-pt|Lusofonia}}) is a cultural entity that includes the countries where Portuguese is the [[official language]], as well as the [[Portuguese diaspora]]. It also includes people who may not have any Portuguese ancestry but are culturally and linguistically linked to Portugal. The [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] or Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries (Portuguese: ''Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa'', abbreviated to CPLP) is the intergovernmental organisation for friendship among [[Lusophone]] (Portuguese-speaking) nations where Portuguese is an official language.

By extension, a sprachraum can also include a group of related languages.  Thus the [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] sprachraum includes [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], and the [[Faroe Islands]], while the Finnic sprachraum is [[Finland]], [[Estonia]] and adjacent areas of [[Scandinavia]] and [[Russia]]. 

Even within a single sprachraum, there can be different, but closely related, languages, otherwise known as [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]]. A classic example is the [[varieties of Chinese]], which can be mutually unintelligible in spoken form, but are typically considered the same language (or, at least, closely related) and have a unified non-phonetic writing system. [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic]] has a similar situation, but its writing system  (an [[abjad]]) reflects the pronunciation of a common literary language ([[Modern Standard Arabic|Modern Standard Arabic]]).

==Examples==
===Germanic languages===
*[[Anglosphere]] (the [[English-speaking world]])
*[[Dutch Language Union]]
*[[List of territorial entities where German is an official language]]
*[[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic Europe cluster]] (continental West Germanic and North Germanic)

===Romance languages===
*[[Catalan Countries]] (the Catalan-speaking part of Europe)
*[[List of territorial entities where French is an official language]]
*[[Hispanophone]] world (where [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is spoken)
*[[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin Europe]]
*[[Geographic distribution of Portuguese|Lusofonia]] (the [[Lusophone]] world)

===Other Indo-European languages===
*[[Hindi belt]]
*[[Slavisphere]]
*[[Greater Iran]] ([[Persian language|Persian]] and closely related languages)

===Other languages===
*[[Arab world]]
*[[Austronesia]]
**[[Malay world]]
*[[Sinophone]] (where [[Chinese languages|various forms of Chinese]] is spoken)
*[[Turkic countries]]

'''Sri Lankan English''' ('''SLE''', '''en-LK'''&lt;ref&gt;&lt;code&gt;en-LK&lt;/code&gt; is the [[language code]] for ''Sri Lankan English'', as defined by [[ISO standard]]s (see [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]) and [[Internet standard]]s (see [[IETF language tag]]).&lt;/ref&gt;) or '''Ceylonese English''' is the [[English language]] as it is spoken in [[Sri Lanka]]. However, the classification of SLE as a separate dialect of English is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick A. and Sussex R. (ed.)

The [[British Empire|British colonial presence]] in [[South Asia]] led to the introduction of English to Sri Lanka. Since 1681, some words have been borrowed from the Sinhala and Tamil language by English.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle R.

== Sri Lankan words in English ==
Sri Lankan words that were borrowed by the English and are used in the language are recorded in ''A Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon in the East Indies''. Such words often relate to [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]]:

== Colloquialisms ==
[[Colloquialism]]s have emerged in SLE. Some involve [[vocabulary]]. Others involve [[grammar]] (such as [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[plural]]s), [[syntax]] and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. Some may be common to [[Indian English]].

== Pronunciation ==
Speakers of Sri Lankan English may have varying ability in producing some sounds. Again, the sound of {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} in "f'''''a'''''ther" and {{IPAc-en|ʌ}} in "l'''''u'''''ck"are absent in Sinhala and so are variably difficult for people from Sri Lanka to pronounce in SLE.

[[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]] occur, as they do in many languages. For instance, "exercise" may be pronounced as "ex-cise".

Some differences in pronunciation may relate to [[socioeconomic]] background and level of education. For example, a word like "note" is pronounced with a [[diphthong]], {{IPAc-en|n|oʊ|t}} in standard English. In SLE, it is pronounced {{IPA|/noːt/}} with the [[monophthong]]; {{IPA|/oː/}} and is accepted as normal in Sri Lanka. However, pronouncing a word like "hall" ({{IPAc-en|h|ɔː|l}}) as *{{IPA|/‍hoːl/}} is not accepted. Other words pronounced with a monophthong include: take and made.

Those unfamiliar with English may add an involuntary /i-/ prior to words like "skill" and "smell". However, this is not standard in SLE.

== Other features ==
The speaker of SLE may not use [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s as readily as English. For example, "What is the matter?" would be used over "What's the matter?"

Some [[elide]]d [[syllables]] in English are pronounced in SLE. For example, "different" would be pronounced "diff-er-ent" ({{IPA|/ˈɖifərənʈ/}}). Also, some syllables normally unstressed and sounded as /ə/ may be sounded as /a(ː)/ (or, /o/, /u/, /e/ or /i/). For example, the word "camera" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|m|ər|ə}}) may become {{IPA|/ˈkæməra(ː)/}}.

In SLE, the first syllable may be emphasised rather than the usual second or third. Examples include, "address", "cassette", "dessert", "museum", "hotel" and "gazette". One may also see differences in the allocation of primary and secondary syllable stresses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20232">[[File:Grandville singe.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard|J.J. Grandville]]'s illustration from the 1855 edition of La Fontaine's fables]]
'''The Monkey and the Cat''' is best known as a fable adapted by [[La Fontaine's Fables|Jean de La Fontaine]] under the title ''Le Singe et le Chat'' that appeared in the second collection of his ''Fables'' in 1679 (IX.17). Although there is no evidence that the story existed before the 15th century, it began to appear in collections of [[Aesop's Fables]] from the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;Notably in Isaac de Benserade's [https://books.google.com/books?id=daUMAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Singe&amp;f=false ''Fables d'Esope'' (1678)]&lt;/ref&gt; but is not included in the [[Perry Index]]. There are popular idioms derived from it in both English and French with the general meaning of being the dupe of another (e.g., a [[wikt:cat's-paw|cat's-paw]]). Usage of these and reference to the fable have been particularly employed in (although not limited to) political contexts.

==The fable and its history==
In La Fontaine's telling, Bertrand the monkey persuades Raton the cat to pull chestnuts from the embers amongst which they are roasting, promising him a share. As the cat scoops them from the fire one by one, burning his paw in the process, the monkey gobbles them up. They are disturbed by a maid entering and the cat gets nothing for its pains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oaks.nvg.org/fonta9.html#timonkcat|title=17. The Monkey and the Cat|publisher=The Gold Scales: oaks.nvg.org|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is from this fable that the French get their idiom ''[[wikt:fr:tirer les marrons du feu|Tirer les marrons du feu]]'', meaning to act as someone's dupe or, deriving from that, to benefit from the dirty work of others. It is also the source of the English idiom 'a cat's paw', defined in the [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] as 'one used by another as a tool'.&lt;ref name="Siefring"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgrUjXLI0TgC&amp;pg=PT247&amp;dq=%22cat%27s+paw%22+idiom|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Idioms|page=247|last=Siefring|first=Judith|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2006|isbn=978-0-19-861055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are earlier idiomatic allusions in 15th century Burgundian sources. [[Jean Miélot]] records the saying ''c'est un bon jeu de chat et singe'' (it's a cat and monkey game) in his ''Proverbes'' (1456) and there is another apparent reference to the story in a poem in [[Jean Molinet]]'s  ''Faictz et dictz''. In the following century, [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]] has the version ''faire comme le singe, tirer les marrons du feu avec la patte du chat'' in his ''Mimes, enseignements et proverbes'' (1575)  and [[John Florio]] includes the saying in his collection of idioms ''Second Frutes'' (1591).&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Dawes, "Pulling the chestnuts out of the fire" in ''Animals and the symbolic in mediaeval art and literature'' (ed) L.A.J.R. Houwen, Groningen 1997, pp.155-69&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the earliest surviving texts relating the story date from the mid-16th century and some of these have a puppy in place of a cat as the monkey's victim. [[Johannes Sambucus]] reports it as happening recently in the Dutch town of [[Bergen op Zoom]] in his ''Emblemata'' (1564). The Latin poem there continues, 'A small monkey gave us an example noteworthy and amusing for its cunning. For, when he saw the chestnuts buried in the hearth, he began to brush the ash aside but, afraid of the burning coals, he suddenly seized the foot of a sleeping puppy and stole it out.'&lt;ref name="Sambucus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FSAb077|title=Non dolo sed virtute|last=Sambucus|first=Johannes|accessdate=25 May 2011|publisher=Glasgow University}} The fable in [https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PA110&amp;id=aw4vWBEkiaAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google books].&lt;/ref&gt; The same story involving a sleeping dog appeared in other [[emblem book]]s, including the ''Choice of Emblemes'' by the English poet [[Geoffrey Whitney]] (1586), who draws a political lesson from it in common with the other emblematists:
::Which shewes, when as ambition fowle doth prick
::The hartes of kinges, then there is no remorce,
::But oftentimes, to aunswere theire desire,
::The subjectes feele both famine, sworde and fire.&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mun.ca/alciato/whit/w058.html|title=Whitney's Choice of Emblemes 58 - Non dolo, sed vi|accessdate=25 May 2011|publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monkey &amp; Cat.jpg|thumb|left|280px|An adaptation of Gheeraert's figure illustrating an engraving of the Schloss Johannisberg vineyards]]
A version in which a cat figures is in Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder's illustrated book of fables, ''De warachtighe fabulen der dieren'' (True animal fables, Bruges, 1567), with Flemish verse provided by the foremost Netherlandic [[Emblem book|emblematist]] [[:fr:Eduard de Dene|Edewaerd de Dene]]. A French version of the ''Fabulen'' was published in 1578 under the title ''Esbatement moral des animaux''.&lt;ref&gt;The book can be viewed at [http://www.fundp.ac.be/universite/bibliotheques/bump/numerisation/livres-imprimes/esbatement-moral-amimaux fundp.ac.be] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926212007/http://www.fundp.ac.be/universite/bibliotheques/bump/numerisation/livres-imprimes/esbatement-moral-amimaux |date=2011-09-26 }} with the fable and its illustration on pages 63 and 64.&lt;/ref&gt; There were several adaptations of Gheeraert's figure in the following century. The Dutch poet [[Joost van den Vondel]] published an emblematic collection based on his prints, ''Vorstelijke Warande der Dieren'' (Princely pleasure-ground of beasts, Amsterdam 1617), in which the poem ''Den aap en de katte'' appears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cf.hum.uva.nl/dsp/ljc/vondel/1617/warande.html |title=Poem LI |publisher=Cf.hum.uva.nl |date=2001-07-19 |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England the scene was reused as one of twelve circular engravings, intended for [[trencher (tableware)|trenchers]], made in 1630-36. The text around the edge of the picture reads: "The Monkey seing nuts in fire Doth force the Cat to plucke them neir; Which showeth the Envious doth not care, Whose House do burne so they have share".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1527506&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=Marcus+Gheeraerts&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;images=on&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=12 |title=View online |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date=2011-09-29 |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany it was incorporated into a view of the Schloss Johannisberg wine estate in [[:de:Daniel Meisner|Daniel Meisner]]'s ''Thesaurus Philopoliticus'' (later known as the ''Sciographia Cosmica'') of 1623. In this combination of the Emblem book and collection of town plans, the scene of the fable takes place on the lower right and is accompanied by verses illustrating the Latin moral, ''Alterius Damno Quaeris Lucrum'' (Another is duped to benefit the greedy)

Elsewhere in Europe, the monkey and cat version appears in [[Simone Majoli]]'s Latin work ''Dies caniculares'' (1588), where it is told of the antics of the pet monkey of [[Pope Julius II]] at the start of the century; a little later the story appeared as ''Un Singe et un Chat'' in Philippe Deprez's collection of a hundred verse fables, ''Le Théâtre des animaux'' (Paris, 1595). It is from one or other of these last two that La Fontaine is said to have adapted his story.&lt;ref name="La Fontaine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lafontaine.net/lesFables/afficheFable.php?id=190&amp;ill|title=Le Singe et le Chat|language=French|accessdate=24 May 2011|publisher=La Fontaine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before he popularised it, the earlier version had been used by two artists: the Roman painter [[Tommaso Salini]] and the Dutch animal painter [[Abraham Hondius]]. Both of these illustrate the detail that La Fontaine chose to modify, in which the monkey uses the cat's paw to poke out the chestnuts against its will.&lt;ref name="La Fontaine"/&gt; A third version of the story, yet again quoted as happening recently, was contained in [[Gemelli Careri]]'s ''Voyage round the world'' (1695) and related by 'the admiral of the Portuguese fleet in India' as witnessed by him.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in a contributor's essay on the cat in ''The Mirror of Literature, Amusement &amp; Instruction'', Vol 24, London 1834, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bos3AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=Voyage+round+the+world,+Dr+John+Francis+Gemelli+Careri&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0Az-TdfIPMej8QOFldTaBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Voyage%20round%20the%20world%2C%20Dr%20John%20Francis%20Gemelli%20Careri&amp;f=false p.165]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the channels through which the fable was taken to be Aesop's was its inclusion among the hydraulic statues in [[the labyrinth of Versailles]] in 1669. These were accompanied by [[quatrain]]s by [[Isaac de Benserade]], which subsequently appeared in ''Les fables d'Ésope, mises en françois, avec le sens moral en quatre vers, &amp; des figures à chaque fable'' (Aesop's fables in French, with a verse commentary and illustrations, 1709). Here the initial quatrain refers to the version where force is used ('The monkey looks sprightly/ but the cat doesn't take lightly/ having its paw acquired/ to pull chestnuts from the fire') while the prose telling which follows is of La Fontaine's version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzRtgcbgx54C&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=Les+fables+d%27%C3%89sope,+mises+en+fran%C3%A7ois,+avec+le+sens+moral+en+quatre+vers,+%26+des+figures+%C3%A0+chaque+fable&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CIhNmeUDCF&amp;sig=eOfXj_TH12Xi-LcdZO3hHvXGjks&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KPH9TeyHFMPysga-95zyDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=le%20singe%20et%20le%20chat&amp;f=false |title=Page 329 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue accompanied by De Benserade's verse is described in Daniel Bellamy's 18th century description of the labyrinth: 'Upon a shell composed of brass, and supported by a column erected in the antique taste with the same metal, the spectator is amused with the resemblance of a large fire, from whence issues a torrent of water. Here a monkey appears with a smiling countenance, grasping a cat's paw with his own, whilst the latter is seemingly struggling to get loose.'&lt;ref&gt;''Ethic Amusements'', London 1768, [https://books.google.com/books?id=117OAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=fable+monkey+and+cat&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PV7eTYfvBpDJswamx4XXBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=fable%20monkey%20and%20cat&amp;f=false fable 27, p.237]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a version in which the monkey uses force that was painted by [[Edwin Landseer]] in 1824 and by his 19th century imitator (see the gallery below). When the former painting was put up for auction in January 2011, U.S. [[Christie's]] recorded that 'The subject of the present painting is taken from the ancient fable traditionally ascribed to Aesop'.&lt;ref name="Christies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=5403463|title=The Monkey and the Cat (Aesop's Fable|accessdate=25 May 2011|publisher=Christie's}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this is far from true, the fable had been appearing in collections of Aesop's Fables since the 17th century. Where the story is ascribed to Aesop, it is in the version where the monkey forcibly uses the cat's paw. La Fontaine's modified version of 1679 can only be regarded as original for the detail of persuasion rather than compulsion. It was translated by neither of La Fontaine's main 18th century English translators, [[Bernard de Mandeville]] (1704) and Charles Denis (1754), but was ascribed to him in the verse ''Flowers of Fable'' in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/flowersoffablecu00londiala#page/340/mode/2up Pages 341-2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Edwin Bennett|Charles H. Bennett]] also included the story in his ''The Fables of Aesop and Others, translated into Human Nature'' (1857) under the title of "The Cat's Paw".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/fablesofsopoth00benn#page/n69/mode/2up/search/cat%27s+paw |title=Page 14 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring back to the plot of [[Oliver Twist]], Bennett's cat acts as thief's apprentice to the monkey.

==Meaning and use==
[[File:Bertrand avec Raton s'amusent à tirer les marrons du feu.JPG|thumb|285px|A satirical French view of military glory from Napoleonic times]]
La Fontaine applies the fable to statecraft,
:No more are the princes, by flattery paid
:For furnishing help in a different trade,
:And burning their fingers to bring
:More power to some mightier king,
and was later followed in this by political cartoonists. One English example, dating from 1766 and titled "The Cat's Paw", satirises a political alliance of the time and represents the [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Earl of Bute]] as a monkey, using the paw of the feline [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Earl of Chatham]] to extract chestnuts from a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grosvenorprints.com/jpegs/7959.jpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726050530/http://www.grosvenorprints.com/jpegs/7959.jpg |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-26 |title=In the British Museum collection |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the idiom at this date is one of the earliest examples in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cats-paws The Merriam-Webster Dictionary] gives 1769 as the earliest use in this sense&lt;/ref&gt; The satirist Peter Pindar ([[John Wolcot]]) continued the political use of the fable by including a lengthy reference to it in his ode “To the Chancellor of the Exchequer” (1801), in the context of the argument over [[Catholic Emancipation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Odes to Ins and Outs'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wkc316cNXJEC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Peter+Pindar+%22The+monkey+and+the+cat%22+-La+-Fontaine&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zMDkTb-yJ4iz8QONhJH2Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ode 4, p.19]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the same issue was illustrated in a caricature from 1804 titled "The monkey and the cat's paw, a fable from Esop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/Wave/image/joconde/0473/m078402_0002474_p.jpg |title=In the musée Jean de la Fontaine |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cat's paw title was to be used once again in a cartoon relating to the political maneuvering that preceded the passing of the English [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act in 1832]]. In this [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] is the cat, being coaxed by the bewigged Lord Chancellor [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], depicted as a monkey seated at his side, to pull the hot iron of reform from a blazing fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grosvenorprints.com/stock.php?pageNum_rs_stock=11&amp;totalRows_rs_stock=892&amp;subject=Satire&amp;WADbSearch1=Submit&amp;search=subject|title=The Cat's Paw image|publisher=Grosvenor Prints|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the reference is to La Fontaine's version of the story. Another contemporary source to draw a parallel between the passing of the bill and the fable was the satirical paper ''[[Figaro in London]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g1tFAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=fable%20cat&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q=fable%20cat&amp;f=false June 23 1832, p.113]&lt;/ref&gt; There the claim is made that the Irish members of Parliament halted agitations for wider representation while the Reform Bill was being passed and were now cheated of a similar reward. The political leader [[Daniel O'Connell]] is likened to the cat in the fable and the report is followed by the poem, “The grey monkey and the Irish cat”, concluding with the lines “And thus 'twill always be, whoever lingers/ About the grate is sure to burn his fingers”. The idiom of getting one's fingers burned alludes, according to ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', “to taking chestnuts from the fire”.&lt;ref&gt;''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, [https://archive.org/stream/brewersdictionar000544mbp#page/n163/mode/2up archived online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the fable was often used to satirise the ambitious sacrificing the life of others for their own ends. The cartoon ''Bertrand avec Raton s'amusent à tirer les marrons du feu'', dating from Napoleonic times, pictures a red uniformed monkey marshall guiding a blue-uniformed infantryman in the task. The theme reappeared in the broadside ''[[La Caricature (1830–1843)|La Caricature]]'' with the title "The monkey and the cat: a military pastime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/Wave/image/joconde/0473/m078402_0002459_p.jpg |title=View online |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cartoon has a marquis urging a barefoot patriotic workman to take his place on a republican barricade, while chuckling to himself that soon the artistocratic exiles will return with their allies to impose a renewed feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/Wave/image/joconde/0473/m078402_0002411_p.jpg |title=In the musée Jean de La Fontaine |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This too is titled "Bertrand et Raton".

The French dramatist [[Eugène Scribe]] gave the same title to his social comedy of 1833. Subtitled ''l'art de conspirer'' (the art of conspiracy), it has also been translated as 'The school for politicians'&lt;ref&gt;There is an [https://archive.org/stream/bertrandetraton00scrigoog#page/n8/mode/2up online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a reworking of a play of the same name by [[Louis-Benoît Picard]] (1805). It is ostensibly based on an episode of Danish history and concerns a [[bourgeois]] dupe caught up in political intrigue. In reality it satirises the [[July Revolution]] of 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen S. Stanton, Scribe's "Bertrand Et Raton": A Well-Made Play, ''The Tulane Drama Review'' Vol. 2, No. 1, Nov., 1957, pp. 58-70; [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1124796 available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands the words of Vondel's ''Den aap en de katte'' were set for [[a cappella]] male chorus by [[Sem Dresden]] to celebrate the centenary of the Royal Dutch Choir in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://claude.torres1.perso.sfr.fr/Pays-Bas/DresdenSem/DresdenSem.html |title=Sem Dresden Sem Dresden was born in 1881 in Amsterdam |publisher=Claude.torres1.perso.sfr.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of [[World War II]], the closing moral that rulers are careless of the suffering of others in fulfilling their ambition had special resonance.

The qualifier "Yucatec" is a tag linguists use to distinguish it from other Mayan languages (such as [[K'iche' language|K'iche']] and [[Itza' language|Itza']]).

In the [[States of Mexico|Mexican states]] of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], some parts of [[Campeche]], [[Tabasco]], [[Chiapas]], and [[Quintana Roo]], Maya remains many speakers' first language today, with 800,000 speakers. There are 6,000 speakers in Belize.

== History ==
[[File:Conflicto Limitrofe Yucatan Campeche Quintana Roo.PNG|thumb|Yucatán Peninsula]]{{Cleanup|reason=wikification, correction|date=September 2016}}
Yucatec Maya forms part of the Yucatecan branch of the [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] family. The Yucatecan branch divides into the subgroups Mopan-itza and Yucatec-Lacandon, which in turn split into four languages: [[Itza’ language|Itza]], [[Mopan language|Mopan]], Yucatec Maya, and [[Lacandon language|Lacandon]]. All the languages in the Mayan language family are thought to originate from an ancestral language that was spoken some 5,000 years ago, known as [[Proto-Mayan language|Proto-Mayan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aboutworldlanguages.com/mayan-language-family|title=Mayan Language Family {{!}} About World Languages|website=aboutworldlanguages.com|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Columbus]] traded with Maya merchants off the coast of [[Yucatán]] in 1502, but never made landfall. Arriving in Yucatán during the decade following Columbus' first contact with the Maya, the first Spanish to set foot on Yucatán soil did so by chance, the survivors of a shipwreck in the Caribbean. Most of the shipwrecked men were sacrificed, leaving just two survivors. In 1519, one of these men (Gerónimo de Aguilar) accompanied  [[Hernán Cortés|Hernán Cortez]] to the Yucatán island of [[Cozumel]], also taking part in the conquest of central Mexico. The other survivor  (Gonzalo Guerrero) became a Mexican legend as father of the first [[Mestizo]]: by Aguilar’s account, Guerrero "went native"- he married native women, wore traditional native apparel, and even fought against the Spanish.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Maya World Yucatec Culture and Society, 1550-1850|last=Restall|first=Matthew|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=0-8047-3658-8|location=Stanford University press,Stanford,California|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco de Montejo]]'s military incursion of Yucatán took three generations and three wars of  heavy fighting that lasted a total of 24 years.The Maya had been in a stable decline when Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1517 AD. From 200 to 800 AD the Maya  were thriving and making great technological advances and created a system for recording numerals and hieroglyphs that was more complex and efficient than what had come before. They migrated Northward and Eastward to the Yucatán peninsula from Palenque, Jaina, and Bonampak. In the 12th and 13th centuries, a coalition emerged in the Yucatán peninsula between three important centers, Uxmal, Chichen Uitza, and Mayapan, where they were able to grow and practice intellectual and artistic achievement during a period of peace, but then war broke out and both intellectual and artistic achievements came to end.  By the 15th century Mayan [[Toltec]] fell. In the 18th century the Spanish turned the lands to large maize and cattle plantations with luxurious haciendas and exported natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isa.unc.edu/language-programs/yucatec-maya-institute/about-the-yucatan/yucatan-history/|title=Yucatan History|website=Institute for the Study of the Americas|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya were subjects of the Spanish Empire from 1542 to 1821.

During the colonization of the Yucatán peninsula, the Spanish believed that in order to evangelize and govern the Maya they needed to reform Yucatec Maya and shape it to serve their ends of religious conversion and social control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanks|first=William F.|date=2012-01-01|title=BIRTH OF A LANGUAGE: The Formation and Spread of Colonial Yucatec Maya|jstor=24394197|journal=Journal of Anthropological Research|volume=68|issue=4|pages=449–471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish [[Missionary|missionaries]] undertook a project of linguistic and social transformation known as ''reducción'' (from Spanish ''reducir),'' a term not widely recognized by historians. The linguistic aspect of this process involved the reformulation of Yucatec Maya, primarily through the translation of religious texts from Spanish into Yucatec Maya and the creation of [[neologism]]s needed to express Catholic religious concepts.  The result of the process of ''reducción'' was ''Maya reducido'', a semantically transformed version of Yucatec Maya. Along with the attempted eradication of all Maya religious practices and associated written works, the missionaries thus shaped a language that was used to convert, subjugate, and govern the Maya population of the Yucatán peninsula. Notwithstanding, ''Maya reducido'' was appropriated by its Maya speakers for their own purposes and served efforts to resist colonial domination. The oldest written records in Maya reducido (which used the [[Roman alphabet]]) were written by Maya notaries between 1557 and 1851. These works can be found in the United States, Mexico, and Spain in libraries and archives&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Phonology==
A characteristic feature of Yucatec Maya, like other Mayan languages, is the use of [[ejective consonant]]s: {{IPA|/pʼ/, /tʼ/, /kʼ/}}. Often referred to as [[glottalization|glottal]]ized consonants, they are produced at the same place of oral articulation as their non-ejective stop counterparts: {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/}}. However, the release of the lingual closure is preceded by a raising of the closed glottis to increase the air pressure in the space between the glottis and the point of closure, resulting in a release with a characteristic ''popping'' sound. The sounds are written using an [[apostrophe]] after the letter to distinguish them from the plain consonants (''t'àan'' "speech" vs. ''táan'' "forehead"). The apostrophes indicating the sounds were not common in written Maya until the 20th century but are now becoming more common. The Mayan ''b'' is also glottalized, an implosive {{IPA|/ɓ/}}, and is sometimes written ''b','' but that is becoming less common.

Yucatec Maya is one of only three Mayan languages to have developed [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], the others being [[Uspantek language|Uspantek]] and one dialect of [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]]. Yucatec distinguishes short vowels and long vowels, indicated by single versus double letters (ii ee aa oo uu), and between high- and low-tone long vowels. High-tone vowels begin on a high pitch and fall in phrase-final position but rise elsewhere, sometimes without much vowel length. It is indicated in writing by an acute accent (íi ée áa óo úu). Low-tone vowels begin on a low pitch and are sustained in length; they are sometimes indicated in writing by a grave accent (ìi èe àa òo ùu).

Also, Yucatec has contrastive laryngealization ([[creaky voice]]) on long vowels, sometimes realized by means of a full intervocalic glottal stop and written as a long vowel with an apostrophe in the middle, as in the plural suffix ''-o'ob''.

===Acquisition===
Phonology acquisition is received idiosyncratically. While one child seems to have severe difficulties with affricates and sibilants, another might have no difficulties with them but significant problems with sensitivity to semantic content, unlike the former child.&lt;ref name="Straight, Henry Stephen 1976 207-18"&gt;Straight, Henry Stephen (1976) "The Acquisition of Maya Phonology Variation in Yucatec Child Language" in Garland Studies in American Indian Linguistics. pp.207-18&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consonants====
There seems to be no incremental development in phonology patterns.  Monolingual children learning the language have shown acquisition of aspiration and deobstruentization but difficulty with sibilants and affricates, and other children show the reverse. Also, some children have been observed fronting palatoalveolars, others retract lamino-alveolars, and still  others retract both.&lt;ref name="Straight, Henry Stephen 1976 207-18"/&gt;

Glottalization was not found to be any more difficult than aspiration. That is significant with Yucatec Mayan languages' use of ejectives. Glottal constriction is high in the developmental hierarchy, and features like [fricative], [apical], or [fortis] are found to be later acquired.&lt;ref name="Straight, Henry Stephen 1976"&gt;Straight, Henry Stephen 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

† the letter '''w''' may represent the sounds {{IPA|/w/}} or {{IPA|/v/}}. The sounds are interchangeable in Yucatec Mayan although {{IPA|/w/}} is considered the proper sound.

====Vowels====
In terms of vowel quality, Yucatec Maya has a straight-forward five vowel system:

{| class="wikitable"
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|- align="center"
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA|i}}
| {{IPA|u}}
|- align="center"
! [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| {{IPA|e}}
| {{IPA|o}}
|- align="center"
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| colspan="2" | {{IPA|a}}
|}

For each of these five vowel qualities, the language contrasts four distinct vowel "shapes", i.e. combinations of length, tone, and phonation type. In the standard orthography first adopted in 1984&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cofemersimir.gob.mx/expediente/20612/mir/43270/anexo/3733913&lt;/ref&gt;, vowel length is indicated by digraphs (e.g. "aa" for IPA {{IPA|[aː]}})

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Short, no/low tone !! Long, low tone !! Long, high tone !! Creaky voice ('rearticulated')
|-
| pik 'eight thousand' {{IPA|[pik]}} || miis 'cat' {{IPA|[mìːs]}} || míis {{IPA|[míːs]}} 'broom, sweep' || ts'o'ok {{IPA|[tsˀo̰ːk]}} 'end'
|}

==Grammar==
Like almost all Mayan languages, Yucatec Maya is verb-initial. Word order varies between [[Verb–object–subject|VOS]] and VSO, with VOS being the most common. Many sentences may appear to be SVO, but this order is due to a [[topic–comment]] system similar to that of Japanese. One of the most widely studied areas of Yucatec is the semantics of time in the language. Yucatec, like many other languages of the world ([[Kalaallisut]], arguably [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] and others) does not have the grammatical category of [[Grammatical tense|tense]]. Temporal information is encoded by a combination of [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], inherent lexical aspect (''[[Lexical aspect|aktionsart]]''), and pragmatically governed conversational inferences. Yucatec is unusual in lacking temporal connectives such as 'before' and 'after'. Another aspect of the language is the core-argument marking strategy, which is a '[[fluid S]] system' in the typology of Dixon (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dixon, Robert M. W.   |authorlink=R. M. W. Dixon |year=1994 |title=Ergativity |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-44898-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; where intransitive subjects are encoded like agents or patients based upon a number of semantic properties as well as the perfectivity of the event.

==Orthography==
The Maya were literate in [[pre-Columbian]] times, when the language was written using [[Maya script]]. The language itself can be traced back to proto-Yucatecan, the ancestor of modern Yucatec Maya, [[Itza language|Itza]], [[Lacandon language|Lacandon]] and [[Mopan language|Mopan]]. Even further back, the language is ultimately related to all other Maya languages through [[proto-Mayan]] itself.

Yucatec Maya is now written in the [[Latin script]]. This was introduced during the [[Spanish Conquest of Yucatán]] which began in the early 16th century, and the now-antiquated conventions of [[Spanish orthography]] of that period ("Colonial orthography") were adapted to transcribe Yucatec Maya. This included the use of '''x''' for the [[Voiceless postalveolar fricative|postalveolar fricative]] sound (which is often written in English as '''sh'''), a sound that in Spanish has since turned into a [[voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]] nowadays spelled '''j'''.

In colonial times a "reversed c" (ɔ) was often used to represent {{IPA|[tsʼ]}}, which is now more usually represented with {{angle bracket|dz}} (and with {{angle bracket|tz'}} in the revised ALMG orthography).

==Use in modern media and popular culture==

Yucatec-language programming is carried by the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples|CDI]]'s radio stations [[XEXPUJ-AM]] ([[Xpujil, Campeche]]), [[XENKA-AM]] ([[Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo]]) and [[XEPET-AM]] ([[Peto, Yucatán]]).

The 2006 film ''[[Apocalypto]]'', directed by [[Mel Gibson]], was filmed entirely in Yucatec Maya. The script was translated into Maya by [[Hilario Chi Canul]] of the Maya community of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, who also worked as a language coach on the production.

In the video game ''[[Civilization V: Gods &amp; Kings]]'', Pacal, leader of the Maya, speaks in Yucatec Maya.

In August 2012, the Mozilla Translathon 2012 event brought over 20 Yucatec Mayan speakers together in a localization effort for the [[Google Endangered Languages Project]], the [[Mozilla]] browser, and the [[MediaWiki]] software used by [[Wikipedia]] and other [[Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
