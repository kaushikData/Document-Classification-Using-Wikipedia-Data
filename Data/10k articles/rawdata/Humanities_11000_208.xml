The '''Adena culture''' was a [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture that existed from 1000 to 200 BC, in a time known as the [[Woodland period#Early Woodland period (1000–1 BC)|Early Woodland period]]. The Adena culture refers to what were probably a number of related Native American societies sharing a burial complex and ceremonial system. The Adena lived in an area including parts of present-day [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Wisconsin]], [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Maryland]].

==Importance==
The Adena Culture was named for the large mound on Thomas Worthington's early 19th-century estate located near [[Chillicothe, Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oplin.org/point/people/erwdpeop.html| title = Identifying Flint Artifacts/Early Woodland People| accessdate = 2008-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which he named "Adena",

Adena sites are concentrated in a relatively small area - maybe 200 sites in the central Ohio Valley, with perhaps another 200 scattered throughout [[Wisconsin]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Maryland]], although those in [[Ohio]] may once have numbered in the thousands. The importance of the Adena complex comes from its considerable influence on other contemporary and succeeding cultures.&lt;ref name="cabrillo.edu"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/adena.html| title = Native Peoples of North America–Adena| accessdate = 2008-09-12 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080920160044/http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/adena.html| archivedate= 20 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adena culture is seen as the precursor to the traditions of the [[Hopewell culture]], which are sometimes thought as an elaboration, or zenith, of Adena traditions.

The Adena were notable for their agricultural practices, pottery, artistic works, and extensive trading network, which supplied them with a variety of raw materials, ranging from copper from the Great Lakes to shells from the Gulf Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://history-world.org/Civilizations%20Of%20The%20Americas.htm| title = Civilizations Of The Americas, The Peoples To The North | accessdate = 2008-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~mdeal/Anth3291/notes7.htm| title = Early Woodland: Northeastern Middlesex Tradition | accessdate = 2008-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wvculture.org/sites/gravecreek.html| title = Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex | accessdate = 2008-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and religion==

===Mounds===
Lasting traces of Adena culture are still seen in the remains of their substantial [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]]. At one point, larger Adena mounds numbered in the hundreds, but only a small number of the remains of the larger Adena earthen monuments still survive today. These [[mound]]s generally ranged in size from {{convert|20|ft|m}} to {{convert|300|ft|m}} in diameter and served as burial structures, ceremonial sites, historical markers, and possibly gathering places. These earthen monuments were built using hundreds of thousands of baskets full of specially selected and graded earth. According to archaeological investigations, Adena earthworks were often built as part of their burial rituals, in which the earth of the earthwork was piled immediately atop a burned mortuary building. These mortuary buildings were intended to keep and maintain the dead until their final burial was performed. Before the construction of the earthworks, some utilitarian and grave goods would be placed on the floor of the structure, which was burned with the goods and honored dead within. The earthwork would then be constructed, and often a new mortuary structure would be placed atop the new earthwork. After a series of repetitions, mortuary/earthwork/mortuary/earthwork, a quite prominent earthwork would remain. In the later Adena period, circular ridges of unknown function were sometimes constructed around the burial earthworks.&lt;ref name="cabrillo.edu"/&gt;

===Shamanism===

Although the mounds are beautiful artistic achievements themselves, Adena artists created smaller, more personal pieces of art. Art motifs that became important to many later Native Americans began with the Adena.&lt;ref name="Adena-Definition from Answers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/adena-culture|title=Adena-Definition from Answers.com|accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motifs such as the weeping eye and cross and circle design became mainstays in many succeeding cultures. Many pieces of art seemed to revolve around [[Shamanism|shamanic]] practices, and the transformation of humans into animals—particularly birds, wolves, bears and deer—and back to human form. This may indicate a belief that the practice imparted the animals' qualities to the wearer or holder of the objects. Deer antlers, both real and constructed of copper, wolf, deer and mountain lion jawbones, and many other objects were fashioned into costumes, necklaces and other forms of regalia by the Adena.&lt;ref name="Power 2004 29–34"&gt;{{cite book |  last = Power | first = Susan |  title = Early Art of the Southeastern Indians-Feathered Serpents and Winged Beings | publisher = [[University of Georgia Press]] | year = 2004 | pages = 29–34 |  isbn = 978-0-8203-2501-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctive tubular smoking pipes, with either flattened or blocked-end mouthpieces, suggest the offering of smoke to the spirits. The objective of pipe smoking may have been altered states of consciousness, achieved through the use of the hallucinogenic plant [[Nicotiana rustica]]. All told, Adena was a manifestation of a broad regional increase in the number and kind of artifacts devoted to spiritual needs.&lt;ref name="Adena-Definition from Answers.com"/&gt;

===Stone tablets===
The Adena also carved small stone tablets, usually 4 or 5&amp;nbsp;inches by 3 or 4&amp;nbsp;inches by .5&amp;nbsp;inches thick. On one or both flat sides were gracefully composed stylized zoomorphs or curvilinear geometric designs in deep relief. Paint has been found on some Adena tablets, leading archaeologists to propose that these stone tablets were probably used to stamp designs on cloth or animal hides, or onto their own bodies.&lt;ref name="Power 2004 29–34"/&gt; It is possible that they were used to outline designs for [[tattoo]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ohsweb.ohiohistory.org/gallery2/main.php?g2_itemId=501|title=Virtual First Ohioans|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pottery===

Unlike in other cultures, Adena [[Native American pottery|pottery]] was not buried with the dead or the remains of the cremated, as were other artifacts. Usually Adena pottery was tempered with grit or crushed limestone and was very thick; its decoration was largely plain, cord-marked or fabric marked, although one type bore a nested-diamond design incised into its surface. The vessel shapes were sub-conoidal or flat-bottomed jars, sometimes with small foot-like supports.&lt;ref name="Adena Site"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.indians-artifact.com/adena.php| title = Adena Site| accessdate = 2008-09-12| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090509221116/http://www.indians-artifact.com/adena.php| archive-date = 2009-05-09| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic life==

===Settlement patterns===
The large and elaborate mound sites served a nearby scattering of people. The population was dispersed in small settlements of one to two structures. A typical house was built in a circle form from 15 to 45 feet in diameter. The walls were made of paired posts tilted outward, that were then joined to other pieces of wood to form a cone shaped roof. The roof was then covered with bark and the walls may have been bark and/or wickerwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adena.com/adena/ad/ad01.htm| title = The Adena Mounds| accessdate = 2008-09-12 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081002010451/http://www.adena.com/adena/ad/ad01.htm| archivedate= 2 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food sources===
Their sustenance was acquired through foraging and the cultivation of native plants.
* Hunted deer, elk, black bear, woodchuck, beaver, porcupine, turkey, trumpeter swan, and ruffed grouse.
* Gathered several edible seed, grasses, and nuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.larryjzimmerman.com/naarch/adena.htm |title=NA Archaeology : Adena |accessdate=2008-09-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627165802/http://www.larryjzimmerman.com/naarch/adena.htm |archivedate=2008-06-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tools===
The Adena ground stone tools and axes. Somewhat rougher slab-like stones with chipped edges were probably used as hoes. Bone and antler were used in small tools, but even more prominently in ornamental objects such as beads, combs, and worked animal-jaw [[gorget]]s or paraphernalia. Spoons, beads and other implements were made from the marine [[conch]]. A few copper axes have been found, but otherwise the metal was hammered into ornamental forms, such as bracelets, rings, beads, and reel-shaped pendants.&lt;ref name="Adena Site"/&gt;

'''Aerial silks''' (also known as '''aerial contortion''', '''aerial ribbons''',  '''aerial tissues''', '''fabric''', '''ribbon''', or '''''tissu''''', depending on personal preference){{citation needed|date=February 2013}} is a type of performance in which one or more artists perform aerial [[acrobatics]] while hanging from a fabric. The fabric may be hung as two pieces, or a single piece, folded to make a loop, classified as hammock silks. Performers climb the suspended fabric without the use of safety lines and rely only on their training and skill to ensure safety. They use the fabric to wrap, suspend, drop, swing, and spiral their bodies into and out of various positions. Aerial silks may be used to fly through the air, striking poses and figures while flying.  Some performers use dried or spray [[rosin]] on their hands and feet to increase the [[friction]] and grip on the fabric.

== Tricks ==
The three main categories of tricks are climbs, wraps, and drops. Climbs employed by aerialists range from purely practical and efficient, such as the Russian climb, to athletic and elegant tricks of their own, such as the straddle climb. Wraps are static poses where aerialists wrap the silks around one or more parts of their body. In general, the more complicated the wrap, the stronger the force of friction and the less effort required to hold oneself up. Some wraps, such as the straddle-back-balance, actually allow performers to completely release their hands. Foot locks are a sub-category of wraps where the silks are wrapped around one or both feet, for instance, an ankle hang. In a drop, performers wrap themselves up high on the silks before falling to a lower position. Drops can combine aspects of [[free fall]], rolling or otherwise rotating oneself before landing in a new pose. Preparation for a drop can make for a pretty wrap, but the ultimate goal is the fall rather than the pose. Of the three trick types, drops require the most strength and are also the most potentially dangerous. Rosin (dry or mixed with rubbing alcohol) is employed to help performers maintain their grip.  Aerial silks are a demanding art and require a high degree of strength, power, flexibility, courage, stamina, and grace to practice.

==Fabrics==
[[Image:Aerial silk.jpg|thumb|right|Christianne "Flip" Sainz of Aerial Angels performing aerial silk at King Richard's Faire, a [[renaissance faire]] in Massachusetts.]]

The fabrics used as silks are very strong with some give and flexibility. The fabric is 2-way stretch polyester lycra or Tricot Nylon. The width varies depending on the routine and the acrobat.  The fabric is usually quite long, as it is doubled for rigging, giving the acrobat two strips of fabric to work with as they perform.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

* '''Stretch'''
** '''Low stretch fabrics.''' Low stretch fabrics are primarily used by beginners who have not yet developed proper climbing technique.
** '''Medium stretch fabrics.''' Medium stretch fabrics are the principal choice of professional aerialists and graduates of professional training programs.
* '''Width'''.  Fabric width is mostly a personal choice. The thickness of the fabric when gathered is also influenced by the "[[Units of textile measurement#Denier|denier]]", or technical thickness of the fabric's weave. 40 denier is a common choice. The following applies to 40 denier nylon fabric:
** 60" - Narrow when open, thin when gathered. Fairly common simply because the fabric is widely available.
** 72-84” - Average for adult performers
** 96" - Wide when open, thick when gathered. Best for adults with large hands.
**108” - Very wide and thick. For adults with very large hands, or specialty acts.
* '''Length'''
**Length is a function of the height of the space available.
** For beginners, it is beneficial if the fabric comes down past the ground, allowing them to practice wraps at a lower level where they can be spotted.
** For intermediate users and above, it is sufficient if the fabrics come down to the ground.
** For all users, the space required is usually between {{convert|20|ft|m|0}} and {{convert|30|ft|m|0}}.  There are a great many tricks that can be done on a {{convert|12|to|15|ft|m|sing=on}} aerial fabric and a few drops require more than 30 feet, but for the most part {{convert|20|to|30|ft|m|0}} is best.

==History==

Aerial silks were invented in 1995 by André Simard, the journey began when he was hired by Cirque du Soleil to develop and research acrobatics in 1987, his job was to discover original and imaginative ways to attract the audience to the shows. (“The beautiful yet dangerous art of aerial silk”, 2010). Now silks have been incorporated into circus arts as well as a form of aerial fitness.

==Rigging==

[[Aerial rigging]] applies to the hanging of aerial silks and hammocks. Aerial silk rigging equipment commonly includes:
* a figure-eight descender, rescue eight, ring, or another piece of hardware for holding the silk
* a ball-bearing swivel to keep the silk from twisting and to allow for spinning, which is sometimes not used but makes spinning more manageable
* [[carabiner]]s for connecting the silk hardware to the swivel, and for connecting the swivel to a mounting point, so depending on the setup, there can be multiple carabiners in use at one time.

Carabiners are the most used rigging piece for all aerial arts, but only two or three styles are safe for aerial use, these are the auto lock gate and screw gate carabiner.  rated two different ways, one for the spine and one for the gate, though distributing weight on the gate is not recommended for it is about 1/3 of the spine kN rating. When using a carabiner for aerial arts, it is important to hook, then rotate and screw downwards, so there is little or no risk that the carabiner will accidentally open or that the screw gate will become unscrewed, also the top part of a carabiner is stronger.

* A span set or daisy chain can be used to add length to the silks if needed, they can also be used to wrap around a beam.  
* A span set is a polyester loop that can hold up to 44kN (10,000 lbs.), depending on the quality. 
* A daisy chain is made of nylon webbing with loops sewn on, to offer more length variation, but it is less strong then a span set and may not be able to withstand the downward force of drops and other aerial tricks. A basic daisy chain tops out at around 4kN (1,000 lbs.) on each loop, and end to end is around 22kN (5,000 lbs.). (Providing Hardware For Flight)

==Kilonewtons==

A [[Newton (unit)#Commonly seen as kilonewtons|kilonewton]] (kN) is a measurement of weight in motion. Knowing the weight that your rigging and hang point can withstand is important for your safety and the maintenance of your equipment. 
Example: A 100-pound aerialist dropping 5 feet on silks, with half a foot of stopping distance and the stretch of the silks, calculates to 1,100 pounds of force exerted on rigging, silks, and person. (Types of Carabiners and What kN Ratings Mean.)
Equation: W x (1 + D falling/ D stopping) 
Example with the equation:
(weight 120 x (1 + distance falling (3 ft.) / distance stopping (1/2 ft.)) 
The weight exerted from this drop would be 840 pounds or 3kN.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3089">'''Asian studies''', a term used usually in [[North America]] for [[Oriental studies]] and is concerned with the  [[Asia]]n people, their cultures, languages, history and politics. Within the Asian sphere, Asian studies combines aspects of [[sociology]], [[history]], [[cultural anthropology]] and many other disciplines to study political, cultural and economic phenomena in Asian traditional and contemporary societies. Asian studies forms a field of [[post-graduate study]] in many universities.

It is a branch of [[area studies]], and many Western universities combine Asian and [[African studies]] in a single faculty or institute, like [[SOAS]] in London.  It is often combined with [[Islamic studies]] in a similar way.  The history of the discipline in the West is covered under [[Oriental studies]].

The '''Bambino Gesu of Arenzano''' locally known as '''Il Grande Piccinino''' (Lit: Child Jesus of Arenzano, the Great Little Child) is a   [[Roman Catholic]] devotional   image depicting the [[Child Jesus]] venerated by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://santatatiana.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/the-miraculous-bambino-gesu/|title=The Miraculous Bambino Gesu|work=Italian Slow Walks|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image takes its iconography from the [[Infant Jesus of Prague]] which was brought by the [[Carmelite Order]] who wanted to propagate its devotion in the area. The feast of the image is celebrated each September 1. Various miraculous claims are associated with the image by its pilgrims, now preserved within the basilica.

==History==
[[File:Santuario del Bambino Gesù di Praga (Arenzano) - Province of Genoa, Liguria, Italy - 23 Feb. 2014.jpg|thumb|Minor Basilica of Bambino Gesu di Arenzano.]]
The image was donated by the [[Marquise]] Delphina Gavotti of [[Savona]] and was presented to the built shrine on 2 June 1902. It replaced a picture image of the [[Infant Jesus of Prague]] brought by the [[Carmelite Order]] on 25 September 1900, which was located beneath the statue of [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]].

[[Pope Pius XI]] granted a [[Canonical coronation]] to the venerated image on 24 February 1924 via his [[Papal legate]] Cardinal [[Rafael Merry del Val]]. The solemn ceremony was attended by many notable prelates, namely the young seminarian at the time, Cardinal [[Giuseppe Siri]] and Queen [[Margherita of Savoy]].

The same [[Pontiff]] raised the sanctuary to the status of a [[Minor Basilica]] on 6 May 1928 through an Apostolic decree signed by the [[Vatican Secretary of State]] Cardinal [[Pietro Gasparri]], where the image is permanently enshrined today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chiesadigenova.it/home_page/itinerari/00362239_Santuario_Bambino_di_Praga___Arenzano.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The British Entertainment History Project (BEHP)''' The History Project records  and preserves interviews with the men and women who have worked in British film, television, radio and  theatre industries over the last 100 years "to ensure that their lives and experiences are preserved for future generations".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s2s.focalint.tv/Publications/AZ_articles/az2016autumn_iss99_british_entertainment_history_project.pdf|date=2016-10-01|title=British Entertainment History Project|accessdate=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1987 by Roy Fowler, the History Project  started as an independent volunteer project by members of the industry trade union, [[Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians|ACTT]], who wanted to preserve the stories and memories of the lives of the men and women who had been working in the various film and television industries. The organisation was originally called the ''ACTT History Project'', reflecting the fact that though it was an entirely separate project run by volunteers, it was nevertheless supported by the ACTT union. In 1991, the ACTT merged with the [[Broadcasting and Entertainment Trades Alliance]], to form [[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union|BECTU (Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/838959/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Film Studios and Industry Bodies &gt; ACT/ACTT/BECTU|website=www.screenonline.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ACTT History Project became known as the BECTU History Project. In 2016, it was officially registered as a company limited by guarantee, as an independent, non-profit, voluntary organisation, and renamed the British Entertainment History Project.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The work of the project continues to be acknowledged and supported by BECTU, industry-related unions and many other media organisations and educational institutions.

== Archive Collection ==
Over the last thirty years, the BECTU History Project has built one of the world's largest archives of industry-related memory. The unique and internationally recognised archive collection has grown to over 700 oral history interviews and over 4,000 hours of audio and video recordings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=That’s Entertainment! Preserving our Entertainment History From Both Sides of the Camera.|last=Threadgall|first=Derek|date=Spring 2017|work=Evergreen|access-date=|publisher=|year=2017|issue=Spring|pages=88–90.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawson &amp; Sean P Holmes.2012 pp435-488; and The BECTU History Project: a postscript 32:3 pp449-451.|first=Andrew|last2=Holmes|first2=Sean P|date=2012|title=The BECTU History Project: A postscript|url=|journal=Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television|volume=32:3|pages=449–451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest independent oral history collection of its kind in the UK.

The recordings are used as a [[primary source]] by researchers and students, especially in the fields of media and social history. In addition, the archive is used by television and radio programmes, film documentaries, publishers, authors, historians, obituarists and journalists as well as the general public. Other partnerships and collaborations include work with the [[British Film Institute|BFI]], the [[BBC]],&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/people-nation-empire/background-to-project|title=BBC - Background to the project - History of the BBC|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[British Universities Film &amp; Video Council]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/newsonscreen/about/history|title=The History of News on Screen  · British Universities Film &amp; Video Council|website=bufvc.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with universities such as the [[University of East Anglia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/film-television-media/research/research-themes/british-film-and-tv-studies/british-cinema/oral-history-project|title=BECTU Oral History Project - UEA|website=www.uea.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the BEHP began working with Sussex University and other partners as part of the '''100 voices That Made The BBC''&lt;nowiki/&gt;',&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; which is part of the ''Connected Histories of the BBC'', funded by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC).

Copies of all interview recordings also form part of the National Film archive of the [[British Film Institute]] and a significant number were made available as part of [[Screenonline|BFI Screen Online]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/oralhistory.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Oral History|website=www.screenonline.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interviewees ==
The interviewees are mainly drawn from professionals in the relevant industries working in the United Kingdom, but also include British professionals who worked abroad. Although the archive includes many well-known or major interviewees, the overall emphasis is on reflecting genuine breadth and variety, including those who may not be well known, but who, nevertheless have contributed to, or witnessed, interesting or important productions or simply have a unique story to tell. Capturing their reminiscences provides information about, and underpins, the cultural history of Britain's broadcasting and entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Andrew|last2=Holmes|first2=Sean P|date=2012|title=Help to Preserve the Real Story of Our Cinema and Television Industries: The BECTU History Project and the Construction of British media History, 1986-2010|url=|journal=Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television|volume=32:3|pages=435–488|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst also shining a light on employment practices and the wider social history of particular periods. The aim is that future historians of the moving image and entertainment industries will have access to extensive personal testimonies from actual participants in these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Recording Our Lives- Celebrating 30 Years of the History Project.|last=Threadgall|first=Derek|date=2017|work=The Veteran|access-date=|last2=Dick|first2=Mike|issue=Spring|volume=154|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewees include actors such as [[Jill Balcon]], and [[Robert Beatty]], union officials, director/producers (Lord [[Richard Attenborough]], [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Bimbi Harris]], [[John Krish]]), presenters such as [[Pete Murray (DJ)|Pete Murray]] and performers such as [[Kenny Lynch]]. One of the earliest recordings is of an interview with Adolph Simon, a silent newsreel cameraman who worked in 1914. In addition there are interviews with veterans such as [[Earl Cameron (actor)|Earl Cameron]] CBE and Jack Hollingshead who joined the BBC in 1930. Most of the crafts and grades are represented, including major cinematographers such as [[Freddie Young]], Art Directors such as [[Carmen Dillon]], Continuity Girls, and Sound Recordists.

== Awards ==
In 1999, the History Project was awarded a £3,500 grant from the [http://www.kraszna-krausz.org.uk/ Kraszna Krausz Foundation] to help towards the enormous task of transcribing hundreds of audio tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bectu.org.uk/news/gen/ng0053.html|title=BECTU News - History Project grant|last=BECTU|website=www.bectu.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the History Project was honoured with a Lifetime Contribution to Broadcasting Award at a ceremony at [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bectu.org.uk/news/1050|title=Kaleidoscope honours History Project - BECTU|website=www.bectu.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Circus Maximus''' ([[Latin]] for ''greatest'' or ''largest [[Circus (building)|circus]]''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: '''Circo Massimo''') is an [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[chariot racing|chariot-racing]] [[stadium]] and mass entertainment venue located in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. Situated in the valley between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] Hills, it was the first and largest stadium in [[ancient Rome]] and its later [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. It measured {{Convert|621|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{Convert|118|m|ft|abbr=on}} in width and could accommodate over 150,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;This is a modern recalculation of the [[seating capacity]] at the Circus, a substantial downward revision of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s estimate of 250,000. For discussion see Humphrey, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; In its fully developed form, it became the model for circuses throughout the Roman Empire. The site is now a public park.

==Events and uses==
{{See also|Chariot racing|Ludi}}
[[File:Plan Rome Caen Circus Maximus Colisée.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Model of Rome in the 4th century AD, by [[Paul Bigot]]. The Circus lies between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] (left) and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] (right); the oval structure to the far right is the [[Colosseum]].]]
The Circus was Rome's largest venue for ''ludi,'' public games connected to [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious]] [[Roman festival|festivals]]. ''Ludi'' were sponsored by leading Romans or the Roman state for the benefit of the [[SPQR|Roman people (''populus Romanus'')]] and [[List of Roman deities|gods]]. Most were held annually or at annual intervals on the [[Roman calendar]]. Others might be given to fulfill a [[Votum|religious vow]], such as the games in celebration of a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. In Roman tradition, the earliest triumphal ''ludi'' at the Circus were [[Votum#Military vota|vowed]] by [[Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin the Proud]] to Jupiter in the [[Roman kingdom|late Regal era]] for his victory over [[Suessa Pometia|Pometia]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, p. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ludi'' ranged in duration and scope from one-day or even half-day events to spectacular multi-venue celebrations held over several days, with religious ceremonies and public feasts, horse and chariot racing, athletics, [[Theatre of ancient Rome|plays]] and recitals, [[Venationes|beast-hunts]] and [[gladiator]] fights. Some included public executions. The greater ''ludi'' at the Circus began with a flamboyant parade ''([[pompa circensis]])'', much like the [[Roman triumph|triumphal procession]], which marked the purpose of the games and introduced the participants.&lt;ref&gt;Described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 7.72.1–13, supplemented by [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]]'s history.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Roman Republic|Rome's Republican era]], the [[aedile]]s organised the games. The most costly and complex of the ''ludi'' offered opportunities to assess an aedile's competence, generosity, and fitness for [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic|higher office]].&lt;ref&gt;Aedileship was a rung on the [[Cursus honorum|ladder of Roman politics]], available to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] and [[plebs|plebeians]] of wealth and high standing. Despite the sometimes crippling personal cost of running for office and providing "extras" for the ''ludi'', a successful aedile could secure popular favor and a substantial share of the vote at election time. [[Julius Caesar]] was among those who solidified his support through his lavish ''ludi'' as aedile.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Circus events, however, seem to have been relatively small and intimate affairs. In 167 BC, "[[tibicen|flute players]], scenic artists and dancers" performed on a temporary stage, probably erected between the two central seating banks. Others were enlarged at enormous expense to fit the entire space. A ''[[venatio]]'' held there in 169 BC, one of several in the 2nd century, employed "63 leopards and 40 bears and elephants", with spectators presumably kept safe by a substantial barrier.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, p. 71. A later iron cage-work barrier is evident at [[Pompey]]'s ''venatione'' of 55 BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Rome's provinces expanded, existing ''ludi'' were embellished and new ''ludi'' invented by politicians who competed for divine and popular support. By the [[Roman Republic#From the Gracchi to Caesar (133–49 BC)|late Republic]], ''ludi'' were held on 57 days of the year;&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, Matthew, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; an unknown number of these would have required full use of the Circus. On many other days, charioteers and jockeys would need to practice on its track. Otherwise, it would have made a convenient corral for the animals traded in the nearby [[Forum Boarium|cattle market]], just outside the starting gate. Beneath the outer stands, next to the Circus' multiple entrances, were workshops and shops. When no games were being held, the Circus at the time of [[Catullus]] (mid-1st century BC) was likely "a dusty open space with shops and booths ... a colourful crowded disreputable area"&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, p. 72, citing [[T. P. Wiseman]], "Looking for Camerius. The Topography of [[Catullus 55]],"  ''Papers of the British School at Rome'', 1980, pp. 11–13 with footnotes.&lt;/ref&gt; frequented by "prostitutes, jugglers, fortune tellers and low-class performing artists."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Circus Maximus - panorama view.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|View of the Circus site from the south-east. The tower in the foreground is part of a medieval fortification.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Rome's emperors met the ever-burgeoning popular demand for regular ''ludi'' and the need for more specialised venues, as essential obligations of [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|their office and cult]]. Over the several centuries of its development, the Circus Maximus became Rome's paramount specialist venue for chariot races. By the late 1st century AD, the [[Colosseum]] had been built to host most of the city's [[gladiator]] shows and smaller beast-hunts, and most track-athletes competed at the purpose-designed [[Stadium of Domitian]], though long-distance foot races were still held at the Circus.&lt;ref&gt;Extraordinarily long races of up to 128 miles, if [[Pliny the Elder]] is to be believed; see Humphrey, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, 135 days of the year were devoted to ''ludi''.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, Matthew, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at the height of its development as a chariot-racing circuit, the circus remained the most suitable space in Rome for religious processions on a grand scale, and was the most popular venue for large-scale ''venationes'';&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 3rd century, the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] laid on a spectacular Circus show in which beasts were hunted through a veritable forest of trees, on a specially built stage.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, p. 128, citing ''Historia Augusta'', Probus, 19.2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, ''ludi'' gradually fell out of favour. The last known beast-hunt at the Circus Maximus took place in 523, and the last known races there were held by [[Totila]] in 549.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, G., Green, P., Grabar, O., ''Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World'', Harvard University Press, 1999, p. 674; citing Procopius, ''The Gothic Wars'', 3. 37. 4.[https://books.google.com/books?id=c788wWR_bLwC&amp;pg=PA674&amp;lpg=PA674&amp;dq=Circus+Maximus+Totila&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ofOwnREggZ&amp;sig=tw5T9JuvMkcYfcW0WqqzBVzMIEA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EQH9TvfrNMrT8gP71cmsAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Circus%20Maximus%20Totila&amp;f=false] For the last known beast-hunt at the Circus, see Humphrey, p. 131. Humphrey describes the last known Circus event (549) as "games".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Similar claims elsewhere, though Procopius doesn't seem to specify the nature of the games or their venue; if any editor has access to Procopius' Bell.

==Topography and construction==

===Regal era===
[[File:Obelisk-popolo.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Flaminio Obelisk|Obelisco Flaminio]]'', now in the [[Piazza del Popolo]], was once part of the dividing barrier (''spina'') at the Circus Maximus]]

The Circus Maximus was sited on the level ground of the Valley of Murcia ''(Vallis Murcia)'', between Rome's [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill]]s. In Rome's early days, the valley would have been rich agricultural land, prone to flooding from the river [[Tiber]] and the stream which divided the valley. The stream was probably bridged at an early date, at the two points where the track had to cross it, and the earliest races would have been held within an agricultural landscape, "with nothing more than turning posts, banks where spectators could sit, and some shrines and sacred spots".&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, p. 11. Humphrey describes this as "like a Greek [[hippodrome]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Livy]]'s [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|history of Rome]], the first [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Roman Kingdom|king of Rome]] [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] built raised, wooden perimeter seating at the Circus for Rome's highest echelons (the [[equites]] and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]), probably midway along the Palatine straight, with an awning against the sun and rain. His grandson, [[Tarquinius Superbus]], added the first seating for citizen-commoners ([[plebs]], or plebeians), either adjacent or on the opposite, Aventine side of the track.&lt;ref&gt;The Aventine was a predominantly plebeian area.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the Circus was probably still little more than a trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained&lt;ref&gt;Tarquin might have employed the plebs in constructing a conduit or drain (cloaca) for Murcia's stream, discharging into the Tiber. See Humphrey, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (''metae''), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open drainage canal between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.&lt;ref&gt;Etruscan tomb paintings of chariot races offer a possible seating model for this earliest phase; noble sponsors and other dignitaries sit in elevated stands, complete with awning. Commoners lounge or sit below, at ground level. At the early Circus Maximus, the sloping ground afforded the possibility of turf seating tiers at an early date &amp;ndash; as imagined by [[Ovid]] in his account of the first Consualia &amp;ndash; replaced with wooden seating tiers by later sponsors and benefactors. See Humphrey, pp. 65–66, 68–69; for early ''metae'' and a possible canal as central dividing barrier, see summary on pp. 292–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republican era===
The games' sponsor (Latin ''editor)'' usually sat beside the images of attending gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'') but seats at the track's perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the [[Roman republic|Republican era]]) the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants were granted rights to a [[curule chair]] at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing.&lt;ref&gt;In the earliest exercise of the right, a curule chair would have been brought to the spot; its permanent positioning there is unlikely. See Humphrey, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 190s&amp;nbsp;BC, stone track-side seating was built, exclusively for senators.&lt;ref&gt;Livy has the plebs seated "promiscuously" (''antea in promiscuo spectabant'') up to then: see Humphrey, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent wooden starting stalls were built in 329 BC. They were gated, brightly painted,&lt;ref&gt;Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 8.20.1&lt;/ref&gt; and staggered to equalise the distances from each start place to the central barrier. In theory, they might have accommodated up to 25 four-horse chariots ( [[Quadriga]]s ) abreast but when team-racing was introduced,&lt;ref&gt;Racing teams might have been used as early as the Regal era (according to some later Roman traditions), or as late as the end of the Punic Wars.&lt;/ref&gt; they were widened, and their number reduced. By the late Republican or early Imperial era, there were twelve stalls. Their divisions were fronted by [[herma|herms]] that served as stops for spring-loaded gates, so that twelve light-weight, [[Quadriga|four-horse]] or [[Biga (chariot)|two-horse chariots]] could be simultaneously released onto the track. The stalls were allocated by lottery, and the various racing teams were identified by their colors.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, p. 171; the gates probably used the same animal-sinew torsion springing as the Roman [[ballista]]; ''Ibid'', pp. 137–138: opposing teams of Reds and Whites are prominent in late Republican literature, and Greens and Blues in the Imperial era. Some Roman authors held that team-racing in multiple colors dated back to the regal era. ''Ibid,'' p. 175 for allocation of stalls by lottery.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, there were seven laps per race. From at least 174&amp;nbsp;BC, they were counted off using large sculpted eggs. In 33&amp;nbsp;BC, an additional system of large bronze dolphin-shaped lap counters was added, positioned well above the central dividing barrier ''(euripus)'' for maximum visibility.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, pp. 261–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sestertius-Caracalla-Circus Maximus-RIC 0500a.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sestertius]] depicting [[Caracalla]], and the Circus Maximus, with Augustus' obelisk midway along the central dividing barrier ''(euripus)'']]
[[Julius Caesar]]'s development of the Circus, commencing around 50&amp;nbsp;BC, extended the seating tiers to run almost the entire circuit of the track, barring the starting gates and a processional entrance at the semi-circular end.&lt;ref&gt;A processional entrance at the semi-circular end,. prior to the erection there of Titus' triumphal arch, is assumed by most modern sources. See Humphrey, pp. 69, 97ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The track measured approximately 621&amp;nbsp;m (2,037&amp;nbsp;ft) in length and 150&amp;nbsp;m (387&amp;nbsp;ft) in breadth. A&amp;nbsp;canal was cut between the track perimeter and its seating to protect spectators and help drain the track.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, pp. 75, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The inner third of the seating formed a trackside ''[[cavea]]''. Its front sections along the central straight were reserved for senators, and those immediately behind for ''equites''. The outer tiers, two thirds of the total, were meant for Roman plebs and non-citizens. They were timber-built, with wooden-framed service buildings, shops and entrance-ways beneath. The total number of seats is uncertain, but was probably in the order of 150,000; [[Pliny the Elder]]'s estimate of 250,000 is unlikely. The wooden bleachers were damaged in a fire of 31&amp;nbsp;BC, either during or after construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]]'s figure of 250,000 circus seats is unreliable; it ignores the necessary interruptions of seating rows by many access stairways and corridors. It might represent a per foot run seating estimate, or include those watching from the nearby heights, outside the building proper. In late Imperial regionary catalogues, seating estimates for the Circus become even wilder; one gives an impossible 450,000 seats. Discussion is in Humphrey, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial era===
[[File:Sestertius Trajan Circus Maximus AD103.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Sestertius of Trajan celebrating the restoration of the Circus Maximus (minted 103 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Sear, David R. (2002). ''Roman Coins and Their Values''. Volume II: The Accession of Nerva to the overthrow of the Severan dynasty, AD96-AD235 (pp.112, coin #3208). London: Spink. {{ISBN|1-902040-45-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The fire damage of 31 was probably repaired by Augustus (Caesar's successor and Rome's first emperor). He modestly claimed credit only for an obelisk and ''pulvinar'' at the site but both were major projects. Ever since its quarrying, long before Rome existed, the obelisk had been sacred to Egyptian Sun-gods.&lt;ref&gt;It was quarried and first dedicated in the reign of [[Seti I]]&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus had it brought from [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] at enormous expense, and erected midway along the dividing barrier of the Circus. It was Rome's first obelisk, an exotically sacred object and a permanent reminder of Augustus' victory over his Roman foes and their Egyptian allies in the recent civil wars. Thanks to him, Rome had secured both a lasting peace and a new Egyptian Province. The ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'' was built on monumental scale, a shrine or temple (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]]'') raised high above the trackside seats. Sometimes, while games were in progress, Augustus watched from there, alongside the gods. Occasionally, his family would join him there. This is the Circus described by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] as "one of the most beautiful and admirable structures in Rome", with "entrances and ascents for the spectators at every shop, so that the countless thousands of people may enter and depart without inconvenience."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, pp. 72–73. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] described the Circus and its seating c.30 BC–AD 8. Augustus also rebuilt Ceres' temple, above the starting gates; it was probably damaged in the fire of 31 BC. ''Ibid,'' pp. 268–272 for Augustus' obelisk.&lt;/ref&gt;    
[[File:Grondplan Circus Maximus.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Groundplan of the Circus Maximus, according to [[Samuel Ball Platner]], 1911. The staggered starting gates are to the left.]]
The site remained prone to flooding,&lt;ref&gt;The ''Ludi Martiales'' of AD 12 were temporarily transferred from the Circus, after a flood.&lt;/ref&gt; probably through the starting gates, until [[Claudius]] made improvements there; they probably included an extramural anti-flooding embankment. Fires in the crowded, wooden perimeter workshops and bleachers were a far greater danger. A fire of 36 AD seems to have started in a basket-maker's workshop under the stands, on the Aventine side; the emperor [[Tiberius]] compensated various small businesses there for their losses.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, pp. 100–101. Claudius' improvements at the Circus included stone-built or marble-clad starting stalls and rebuilt turning posts.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Great Fire of Rome|AD 64]], during [[Nero]]'s reign, fire broke out at the semi-circular end of the Circus, swept through the stands and shops, and destroyed much of the city. Games and festivals continued at the Circus, which was rebuilt over several years to the same footprint and design.&lt;ref&gt;Nero, inordinately fond of chariot-racing, may have considered the Circus rebuilding a priority but the overall cost of Rome's rebuilding must have proved an extraordinary drain on Imperial and public funds. Wooden bleachers for the Roman masses were an expedient, cost-effective solution. If Nero had grander plans for the Circus, they ended with his suicide under compulsion, after a coup d'etat in AD 68. Humphrey, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1st century AD, the central dividing barrier comprised a series of water basins, or else a single watercourse open in some places and bridged over in others. It offered opportunities for artistic embellishment and decorative swagger, and included the temples and statues of various deities, fountains, and refuges for those assistants involved in more dangerous circus activities, such as beast-hunts and the recovery of casualties during races.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, pp. 293–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 81 the Senate built a triple arch honoring [[Titus]] at the semi-circular end of the Circus, to replace or augment a former processional entrance.&lt;ref&gt;This is not to be confused with the [[Arch of Titus]], built over the [[Via Sacra]] on the opposite side of the Palatine.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Domitian]] built a new, multi-storey palace on the Palatine, connected somehow to the Circus; he likely watched the games in autocratic style, from high above and barely visible to those below. Repairs to fire damage during his reign may already have been under way before his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of further fire-damage, coupled with Domitian's fate, may have prompted [[Trajan]]'s decision to rebuild the Circus entirely in stone, and provide a new pulvinar in the stands where Rome's emperor could be seen and honoured as part of the Roman community, alongside her gods. Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of the starting gate area under [[Caracalla]], and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in [[Diocletian]]'s reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, pp. 80, 102, 126–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==
{{Wide image|Circus Maximus in Rome.jpg|900px|The Circus Maximus site and the Palatine Hill in background|box width|center|alt=alt text}}

The southeastern turn of the track ran between two shrines which may have predated the Circus' formal development. One, located at the outer southeast perimeter, was dedicated to the valley's eponymous goddess [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]], an obscure deity associated with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the [[Myrtus|myrtle]] shrub, a sacred spring, the stream that divided the valley, and the lesser peak of the Aventine Hill.&lt;ref&gt;The prestige attached to the [[curule chair]] granted [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants in 494 BC would have been enhanced by its positioning close to this shrine. See Humphrey, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The other was at the southeastern turning-post; where there was an underground shrine to [[Consus]], a minor god of grain-stores, connected to the grain-goddess [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and to the [[underworld]]. According to Roman tradition, [[Romulus]] discovered this shrine shortly after the [[founding of Rome]]. He invented the [[Consualia]] festival, as a way of gathering his Sabine neighbours at a celebration that included horse-races and drinking. During these distractions, Romulus's men then [[bride abduction|abducted]] the Sabine daughters as brides. Thus the famous [[Roman mythology|Roman myth]] of the [[Rape of the Sabine women]] had as its setting the Circus and the Consualia.

In this quasi-legendary era, horse or chariot races would have been held at the Circus site. The track width may have been determined by the distance between Murcia's and Consus' shrines at the southeastern end, and its length by the distance between these two shrines and [[Hercules]]' [[Ara Maxima]], supposedly older than Rome itself and sited behind the Circus' starting place.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;. The position of Consus' shrine at the turn of the track recalls the placing of shrines to Roman [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'s Greek equivalent, [[Poseidon]], in Greek [[hippodrome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, p. 62; "later Roman authors often reported the Consualia were held in honour of [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptunus Equestris]]."&lt;/ref&gt; In later developments, the altar of Consus, as one of the Circus's [[tutelary deity|patron deities]], was incorporated into the fabric of the south-eastern turning post. When Murcia's stream was partly built over, to form a dividing barrier (the ''spina'' or ''euripus'')&lt;ref&gt;Most modern sources use ''spina'' (a spine) for the central barrier, based on a single, very late Roman source ([[Cassiodorus]]), but most Roman sources used ''euripus'', a Greek word meaning a channel, strait, or canal, and thus a barrier. See Humphrey, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; between the turning posts, her shrine was either retained or rebuilt. In the Late Imperial period, both the southeastern turn and the circus itself were sometimes known as ''Vallis Murcia''.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, pp. 61–2. For Murcia's shifting topographical associations, see Otto Skutsch, "Enniana IV: Condendae urbis auspicia", ''The Classical Quarterly, New Series'', Vol. 11, No. 2 (Nov., 1961), pp. 252–67.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbols used to count race-laps also held religious significance; [[Castor and Pollux]], who were [[Leda (mythology)|born from an egg]], were patrons of horses, horsemen, and the [[equestrian order]] ''(equites)''. Likewise, the later use of dolphin-shaped lap counters reinforced associations between the races, swiftness, and [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptune]], as god of earthquakes and horses; the Romans believed dolphins to be the swiftest of all creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, pp. 261–5.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Romans adopted the Phrygian [[Magna Mater|Geat Mother]] as an ancestral deity, a statue of her on lion-back was erected within the circus, probably on the dividing barrier.

[[File:Roman - Intaglio of a Circus with a Chariot Race - Walters 421314.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Jasper]] [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]] (2nd century AD) depicting chariot races, with the three-pointed  ''metae'' at each end of the dividing barrer shown at top ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]
Sun and Moon cults were probably represented at the Circus from its earliest phases. Their importance grew with the introduction of Roman cult to Apollo, and the development of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and solar monism as a theological basis for the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman Imperial cult]]. In the Imperial era, the Sun-god was divine patron of the Circus and its games. His sacred [[obelisk]] towered over the arena, set in the central barrier, close to his temple and the finishing line.  The Sun-god was the ultimate, victorious charioteer, driving his four-horse chariot (''[[quadriga]]'') through the heavenly circuit from sunrise to sunset. His partner Luna drove her two-horse chariot (''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]''); together, they represented the predictable, orderly movement of the cosmos and the circuit of time, which found analogy in the Circus track.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Sorabella, "A Roman Sarcophagus and Its Patron", ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'', Vol. 36, (2001), p. 75. See also Doro Levi, "Aion", ''Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens'', Vol. 13, 4, 1944, pp. 287ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In Imperial cosmology, the emperor was Sol-Apollo's earthly equivalent, and Luna may have been linked to the empress.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;!-- Emperor and Sol is covered by Humphrey but no RS as yet for Luna's Imperial equivalence in the reigning empress. Severan (Julia Domna) coins sorta suggest it but could equally show Cybele  --&gt; Luna's temple, built long before Apollo's, burned down in the [[Great Fire of Rome|Great Fire of 64 AD]] and was probably not replaced. Her cult was closely identified with that of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], who seems to have been represented in the processions that started Circus games, and with [[Sol Indiges]], usually identified as her brother. After the loss of her temple, her cult may have been transferred to Sol's temple on the dividing barrier, or one beside it; both would have been open to the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, pp. 61–64, 92–94, 270–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Temples to several deities overlooked the Circus; most are now lost. The temples to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] stood close together on the Aventine, more or less opposite the Circus' starting gate, which remained under Hercules' protection. Further southeast along the Aventine was a temple to [[Temple of Luna|Luna]], the moon goddess. Aventine temples to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Obsequens]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Dis Pater|Dis]] (or perhaps [[Summanus]]) stood on the slopes above the southeast turn. On the Palatine hill, opposite to Ceres's temple, stood the temple to [[Temple of Cybele (Palatine)|Magna Mater]] and, more or less opposite Luna's temple, one to the sun-god [[Temple of Apollo Palatinus|Apollo]].

Several festivals, some of uncertain foundation and date, were held at the Circus in historical times. The Consualia, with its semi-mythical establishment by Romulus, and the [[Cerealia]], the major festival of Ceres, were probably older than the earliest historically attested "Roman Games" ''([[Ludi Romani]])'' held at the Circus in honour of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in 366 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1.56.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Imperial era, [[Ovid]] describes the opening of Cerealia (mid to late April) with a horse race at the Circus,&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, 1995, p.137.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the nighttime release of foxes into the stadium, their tails ablaze with lighted torches.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Barbette Spaeth|Spaeth, Barbette Stanley]], ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Some early connection is likely between Ceres as goddess of grain crops and Consus as a god of grain storage and patron of the Circus.

==Modern status and uses==
[[File:Circus-Maximus-June-1983.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins overlooking the Circus Maximus, seen from the Aventine (1983)]]
After the 6th century, the Circus fell into disuse and decay, and was quarried for building materials. The lower levels, ever prone to flooding, were gradually buried under waterlogged alluvial soil and accumulated debris, so that the original track is now buried 6m beneath the modern surface. In the 11th century, the Circus was "replaced by dwellings rented out by the congregation of Saint-Guy."&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Choay, (Trans. Lauren M. O'Connell), ''The Invention of the Historic Monument'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, a watercourse was dug there to drain the soil, and by the 1500s the area was used as a market garden.&lt;ref&gt;Partner, Peter, ''Renaissance Rome, 1500–1559: a portrait of a society'', University of California Press, 1976, pp.4, 166.[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;id=An0HYF7hvP4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Circus+maximus&amp;ots=-i5ilvIdq2&amp;sig=hTXf1nOloZhqROTqFoGqRApr-1c#v=onepage&amp;q=circus&amp;f=false googlebooks preview]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Circus' standing structures survived these changes; in 1587, two obelisks were removed from the central barrier by [[Pope Sixtus V]], and one of these was re-sited at the [[Piazza del Popolo]]. Mid 19th century workings at the circus site uncovered the lower parts of a seating tier and outer portico. Since then, a series of excavations has exposed further sections of the seating, curved turn and central barrier but further exploration has been limited by the scale, depth and waterlogging of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
 [[File:FIFA world cup 2006 - Rome circus maximus flag.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Italian [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]] victory celebration at the site of the Circus]]
The Circus site now functions as a large park area, in the centre of the city.
It is often used for concerts and meetings. The [[Live 8 concert, Rome|Rome concert of Live 8]] (July 2, 2005) was held there. The English band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] performed a concert before an estimated audience of 500,000 people in 2007 (this was filmed and released as [[When in Rome 2007]]). [[The Rolling Stones]] played there in front of 71,527 people on June 22, 2014 for the Italian date of their [[14 On Fire]] tour. The Circus has also hosted victory celebrations, following the Italian [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]] victory and the [[A.S. Roma]] [[Serie A]] victory in 2001.

'''Community archives''' are [[archives]] created or accumulated, described, and/or preserved by individuals and community groups who desire to document their cultural heritage based on shared experiences, interests, and/or identities,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/422757095|title=Currents of archival thinking|date=2010|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|others=Eastwood, Terry, 1943-, MacNeil, Heather.|isbn=9781591586562|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|oclc=422757095}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes without the traditional intervention of formally trained archivists, historians, and librarians. Instead, the engaged community members determine the scope and contents of the community archive, often with a focus on a significant shared event, such as the [[Ferguson unrest]] (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.wustl.edu/ferguson/|title=Documenting Ferguson|website=digital.wustl.edu|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community archives are created in response to needs defined by the members of a community, who may also exert control over how materials are used.&lt;ref name="whose"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flinn|first1=Andrew|last2=Stevens|first2=Mary|last3=Shepherd|first3=Elizabeth|title=Whose memories, whose archives?

Although local and regional societies, churches, and museums have collected community records for generations, community archives increased in number and popularity throughout the 1970s and 1980s,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which Anne Gillian and Andrew Flinn believe may be due in part to increased interest in [[oral history]] and community representation in response to the emerging anti-war, anti-establishment, civil rights, and student activism movements of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilliland|first=Anne|last2=Flinn|first2=Andrew|date=2013|title=Community Archives: what are we really talking about?|url=https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/920626/gilliland_flinn_keynote.pdf|journal=CIRN Prato Community Informatics Conference 2013|volume=|pages=|via=Keynote Speech}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The work of community archives received little recognition from archival scholars until the early 2000s, when several published studies explored the relationships between communities, archives, and collective memory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Jeannette Bastian]]’s ''Owning Memory: How a Caribbean Community Lost Its Archives and Found Its History''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57492142|title=Owning memory : how a Caribbean community lost its archives and found its history|last=Allis.|first=Bastian, Jeannette|date=2003|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=|isbn=9780313320088|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=13|oclc=57492142}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered{{By whom|date=May 2018}} to be one of the most significant of these publications. Bastian discusses the experience of the people of the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]] and Virgin Islanders' efforts to rebuild their “house of memory”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; after losing local control of nearly all governmental documents and records to their historical and current colonial rulers. Bastian's work introduces several key concepts, including the notion of a "community of records" to acknowledge that communities are entities that both create records and whose input is needed to contextualize the records they create.
== Methods ==
Community archives may be developed via participatory or autonomous practices, and can occur in both physical and virtual spaces, including through the [[digitization]] of dispersed physical materials.&lt;ref name="local"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ormond-Parker|first1=Lyndon|last2=Sloggett|first2=Robyn|date=2012|title=Local archives and community collecting in the digital age|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10502-011-9154-1|journal=Archival Science|volume=12|issue=2|pages=191-212|doi=10.1007/s10502-011-9154-1|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whose" /&gt; The [[participatory archives]] model was defined by Isto Huvila in 2008 to discuss how individuals actively and consciously participate in the creation of shared heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.istohuvila.se/participatory-archive|title=Participatory archive {{!}} Isto Huvila|website=www.istohuvila.se|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the idea of [[participatory culture]] (as opposed to [[Consumer Culture|consumer culture]]), the participatory collection's focus is to create opportunities for civic engagement and artistic expression, encouraging participants to share information and resources with the community to achieve a common goal. The autonomous archives framework was introduced in 2010 by Shauna Moore and Susan Pell to describe community-based collections that are constituted as intentional social and political acts by and for emerging publics, often enacted by those who have been traditionally excluded from the dominant cultural discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Shauna|last2=Pell|first2=Susan|date=June 2010|title=Autonomous archives|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/13527251003775513|journal=International Journal of Heritage Studies|volume=16|issue=4-5|pages=255-268|doi=10.1080/13527251003775513|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The act of bringing together dispersed records online, also called “virtual reunification,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Punzalan|first=Ricardo L.|date=2014-07-01|title=Understanding Virtual Reunification|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/676489|journal=The Library Quarterly|volume=84|issue=3|pages=294–323|doi=10.1086/676489|issn=0024-2519}}&lt;/ref&gt; may encourage a more holistic understating of community history and strengthen community ties. However, communities that cannot support these endeavors on their own but wish to remain autonomous may face added complexity, due to the technological infrastructure required to ensure that collections are developed on a platform that can be supported and maintained over time. 

== Challenges ==
As the term "community archive" has gained popularity, it has been applied in a variety of ways, including as a way to denote community participation in knowledge creation and preservation in ways that may challenge existing dominant historical and political narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ML|first=Caswell,|date=2017-10-25|title=“Inventing New Archival Imaginaries: Theoretical Foundations for Identity-Based Community Archives.”|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8gv0v69b#main|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saada.org|title=South Asian American Digital Archive (SAADA)|website=South Asian American Digital Archive (SAADA)|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ambiguity inherent in defining the terms "[[community]]" and "[[Archive|archives]]" complicates attempts to discuss and define what is meant by "community archives". Therefore, allowing these independent entities to label and define their organizations and missions is one important way to support their activities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Whether community archives consider their endeavors to be political, exerting control over community documentation and storytelling inherently calls attention to issues of power manifest in traditional approaches to archival creation and maintenance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} As the interest in, and number of, community archives increase globally, opportunities to document and share these efforts and materials with the general public may result in tension between community archives stakeholders and heritage professionals who are trained with an emphasis on legal, intellectual, and physical control of records.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} 

Since many community archives develop as independent social spaces, often distinct from mainstream narratives, their organizational champions may resist archival labels and/or intervention by trained professionals out of concern that collections may be absorbed by formal institutions and  rendered inaccessible to their communities. Therefore, issues of independence and autonomy tend to be at the forefront of community archival identities, even if they seek partnerships or welcome support from traditional cultural heritage institutions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Constitution of Jamaica''' is the [[constitution]] and highest law of [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Jamaica, chapter 1, article 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As a constituent province of the [[West Indies Federation]], Jamaica became independent of the [[United Kingdom]] on 6 August 1962 under the [[Jamaica Independence Act 1962]]. Under the [[West Indies Act 1962]], the [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]] was allowed to form governments for the former colonies of the West Indies Federation. [[Elizabeth II]], by and with the advice of Her Privy Council, issued the Jamaica Order in Council 1962 which formally gave force and effect to the constitution.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;'''&lt;/noinclude&gt;Cultural conservatism&lt;noinclude&gt;'''&lt;/noinclude&gt; is described as the preservation of the heritage of one nation, or of a shared culture that is not defined by national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RbwDNb5jtzUC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Cultural conservatism, political liberalism: from criticism to cultural studies''] by James Seaton, University of Michigan Press, 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-472-10645-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-472-10645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other variants of cultural conservatism are concerned with culture attached to a given language such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].

The shared culture may be as divergent as [[Western culture]] or [[Chinese culture]].

Cultural conservatism is distinct from [[social conservatism]], although there are some overlaps. Social conservatives believe that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing what they consider traditional values or behaviors. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often through civil law or regulation. Social conservatives generally view any social change as suspect, rather than just those related to culture or cultural tradition.

==United States==
In the US, ''cultural conservative'' may imply a conservative position in the [[culture wars]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

An example of a cultural conservative in the broader sense is [[Allan Bloom]], arguing in ''[[The Closing of the American Mind]]'' against [[cultural relativism]]. Another example is Senator [[Jim Webb]] (D-Virginia), author of ''[[Born Fighting]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Edwardian Baroque''' is the [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]] architectural style of many public buildings built in the [[British Empire]] during the [[Edwardian era]] (1901–1910).

==Description==
The characteristic features of the Edwardian Baroque style were drawn from two main sources: the architecture of France during the 18th century and that of Sir [[Christopher Wren]] in [[England]] during the 17th—part of the [[English Baroque]]. [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] was a major exponent, designing many commercial buildings in what he termed 'the Grand Style' during the later 1910s and 1920s. This period of British architectural history is considered a particularly retrospective one, since it is contemporary with [[Art Nouveau]].

Typical details of Edwardian Baroque architecture include extensive [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]], usually more extreme at ground level, often running into and exaggerating the [[voussoir]]s of arched openings (derived from French models); domed corner rooftop pavilions and a central taller tower-like element creating a lively rooftop silhouette; revived Italian Baroque elements such as exaggerated keystones, segmental arched pediments, columns with engaged blocks, attached block-like rustication to window surrounds; [[colonnades]] of (sometimes paired) columns in the [[Ionic order]] and domed towers modelled closely on Wren's for the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]]. Some Edwardian Baroque buildings include details from other sources, such as the [[Dutch gable]]s of [[Norman Shaw]]'s [[Le Meridien Hotel Piccadilly|Piccadilly Hotel]] in [[London]].

'''''Eminent Historians: Their Techniques, Their Line, Their Fraud''''' is [[Arun Shourie]]'s fifteenth book and was published in 1998.

== Summary ==
It discusses the [[NCERT controversy]] in Indian politics and attacks [[Marxist historiography]]. Shourie asserts that Marxist historians have controlled and misused important institutions like the [[Indian Council of Historical Research]], the [[National Council of Educational Research Training]] (NCERT) and a large part of academia and the media. He criticizes well-known historians like [[Romila Thapar]] and [[Irfan Habib]]. Shourie argues that Marxist historians have white-washed the records of rulers like [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] and [[Aurangzeb]]. Shourie presents examples to further his argument of how many of these text books describe in great detail foreign personalities like [[Karl Marx]] or [[Joseph Stalin]], while they often barely mention important figures of India or of the Indian states. Shourie writes that this is in contrast to Russian Marxist text books. The standard [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] work, ''A History of India'' (1973), is according to Shourie much more objective and truthful than the history books written by Indian Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indolink.com/Book/book64.html|title=INDOlink - Book Review - Eminent Historians|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This book also talks about a circular which was issued by the Communist Government in West Bengal in 1989 in which it had asked the authors and the publishers of Class IX History textbooks to make sure that "Muslim rule should never attract any criticism. Destruction of temples by muslim rulers and invaders should not be mentioned." &lt;ref&gt;Arun Shourie (2004). ''Eminent Historians''; 3rd ed. New Delhi: [[Rupa Publications]]. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book states in the preface:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
They have made present-day India, and Hinduism even more so, out to be a zoo - an agglomeration of assorted, disparate specimens. No such thing as "India", just a geographical expression, just a construct of the British; no such thing as Hinduism, just a word used by Arabs to describe the assortment they encountered, just an invention of the communalists to impose a uniformity - that has been their stance. For this they have blackened the Hindu period of our history, and, as we shall see, strained to whitewash the Islamic period. (p. x)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Commentaries==
P. Heehs cited the book as an example of "reactionary orientalists' reaction against a perceived attack on Indian spiritual values".&lt;ref name="Heehs"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heehs|first1=Peter|title=Shades of Orientalism: Paradoxes and Problems in Indian Historiography|journal=History and Theory|volume=42|issue=2|year=2003|pages=169–195|doi=10.1111/1468-2303.00238|jstor=3590880}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]] cites the book as an example of Hindu nationalist criticism of Marxist historiography.&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;Edwin Bryant (2004), ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: the Indo-Aryan Migration Debate'', New York: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-516947-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Dwijendra Narayan Jha|D.N. Jha]], who is one of the scholars Shourie has attacked in his book, has refuted Shourie claiming Shourie has distorted his writings, made false allegations of plagiarism against him, and that Shourie's book contains errors and inaccuracies. The book, according to Jha, contains "slander" and "has nothing to do with history." Jha also claims that Shourie's book has been written out of political opportunism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grist to the reactionary mill|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/grist-to-the-reactionary-mill/|work = Indian Express|date=9 July 2014|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Votes do not guide intellectuals: D N Jha|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/votes-do-not-guide-intellectuals-d-n-jha-114112900682_1.html|work = Business Standard|date=9 November 2014|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kafila"&gt;{{cite web|title=How History Was Unmade At Nalanda!

__NOTOC__
'''''Encyclopædia Iranica''''' is a project whose goal is to create a comprehensive and authoritative [[English language]] [[encyclopedia]] about the history, culture, and civilization of [[Iranian peoples]] from prehistory to modern times.

== Scope ==
The ''Encyclopædia Iranica'' is dedicated to the study of Iranian civilization in the wider [[Middle East]], the [[Caucasus]], Europe, [[Central Asia]] and the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. The academic reference work will eventually cover all aspects of Iranian history and culture as well as all [[Iranian languages]] and literatures, facilitating the whole range of Iranian studies research from archeology to political sciences. It is a project founded by [[Ehsan Yarshater]] at [[Columbia University]], started in 1973 at its Center for Iranian Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/pages/about|title=Iranicaonline|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banuazizi|first=Ali|date=1990|title=Review of ''Encyclopædia Iranica'' by Ehsan Yarshater|url=|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=22|issue=3|pages=370–373|doi=10.1017/s0020743800034279|jstor=164148|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the standard encyclopaedia of the [[academic discipline]] of [[Iranistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/pages/scholar-quotes|title=Praise from Scholars Worldwide|website=Encyclopædia Iranica|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of the encyclopedia goes beyond modern [[Iran]] (also known as "Persia") and encompasses the entire [[Greater Iran|Iranian cultural sphere]], and far beyond. Relations of the Iranian world with other cultures (China, European countries, etc.) are also covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/nov03/features5.php|title=''Encyclopedia Iranica''|last=Boss|first=Shira J.|date=November 2003|website=Columbia College Today|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trompf|first=Garry W.|date=2008|title=Encyclopedia Iranica - 35: A New Agenda for Persian Studies?|url=|journal=Iran &amp; the Caucasus|volume=12|issue=2|pages=385–395|doi=10.1163/157338408X406137|jstor=25597382|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Staff and Progress ==
Yarshater was the editor-in-chief, and managing editor is [[Ahmad Ashraf]]. The editorial board includes [[Nicholas Sims-Williams]], [[Christopher J. Brunner]], [[Mohsen Ashtiany]], [[Manuchehr Kasheff]], and over 40 Consulting Editors from major international institutions doing research in Iranian Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/pages/about|title=About ''Iranica''|last=|website=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number (over 1,300 in 2016) of scholars worldwide have contributed articles to ''Encyclopædia Iranica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/pages/about-authors|title=Authors|last=|website=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has published 15 volumes, and is planning on publishing a total of up to 45 volumes. The full text of most entries is available free for on-line viewing. In a 2013 interview with BBC Persian, Yarshater stated that the completion of the project is scheduled for 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/tvandradio/2013/07/130703_u07_chamedan_ehsan_yarshater_radio_short.shtml|title=چمدان: احسان یارشاطر 'هرگز' به ایران باز نمی‌گردد|date=2013-07-04|access-date=2016-07-14|work=BBC Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
On March 25, 2007, the [[Associated Press]] released a news report about ''Encyclopædia Iranica'', claiming that it is "U.S.-backed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070326/iran_encyclopedia_070326/20070326?hub=Entertainment|title=U.S.-funded encyclopedia revels in Iran's greatness|date=2007-03-26|website=CTV|access-date=2016-07-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116041253/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070326/iran_encyclopedia_070326/20070326?hub=Entertainment|archivedate=2009-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Encyclopædia Iranica'' published an official response, saying the report was "inaccurate and libelous", that while the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] supports the encyclopedia, the Endowment is "an independent federal agency whose many projects are reviewed and decided upon by independent panels of scholars", not the U.S. Government, and that only a third of the encyclopedia's budget is supplied by the Endowment, not half, as the Associated Press had claimed.&lt;ref name="ashraf-ap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranian.com/News/2007/April/Images/ReplyToAP.pdf |title=Official response of the Encyclopaedia Iranica to the ''Associated Press'' article of March 25, 2007 entitled "U.S.-funded encyclopedia revels in Iran's greatness" |last=Ashraf |first=Ahmad |date=2007-04-05 |publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FZzqUrMz?url=http://iranian.com/News/2007/April/Images/ReplyToAP.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-02 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many foundations, organizations, and individuals have supported ''Encyclopædia Iranica''. The encyclopaedia has been sponsored since 1979 by the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], [[Union Académique Internationale]], [[Iran Heritage Foundation]], and many other [[charitable foundation]]s, philanthropic families and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/pages/sponsorship|title=Sponsors|last=|website=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In a review of Volume III, [[Richard W. Bulliet]] calls ''Encyclopædia Iranica'' "not just a necessity for Iranists [but] of inestimable value for everyone concerned with the history and culture of the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bulliet|first=Richard W.|date=1992|title=Review of ''Encyclopædia Iranica'' by Ehsan Yarshater|url=|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=24|issue=4|page=680|doi=|jstor=164443|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Banuazizi, though, notes that its focus is on Iran "as perceived, analyzed, and described by its most distinguished, mainly Western, students".&lt;ref&gt;Banuazizi (1990), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the journal ''[[Iranian Studies (journal)|Iranian Studies]]'' devoted a double issue (vol. 31, no. 3/4) to reviews of the encyclopædia, coming to 700 pages by 29 authors on as many subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1998|title=Review of the ''Encyclopedia Iranica''|url=|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=31|issue=3/4|doi=|issn=0021-0862|jstor=i401469|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of the British Union of Fascists.svg|right|thumb|The flag of the British Union of Fascists, known as the "Union Banner"]]The '''flash and circle''' is a political symbol used by several organisations. It was first used by the [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF), and was adopted in 1935. The BUF had originally used the fasces as its symbol, first on a black disc on a gold background and later in gold with a lightning bolt struck through it on a black background. The flash and circle was designed as a more abstract depiction of the concept of the fasces incorporating the lightning of the 1933 flag within a "circle of unity" and the British national colours of red, white and blue. [[Oswald Mosley]]'s post-war group the [[Union Movement]] and his [[National Party of Europe]] initiative continued to use the flash.

The American [[National Renaissance Party (United States)|National Renaissance Party]] adopted the lightning bolt within a circle as their symbol, which superseded [[James Hartung Madole]]'s use of the [[swastika]]. It decorated their [[Podium|rostrum]] and was worn on their [[armband]]s.

The BUF's left-wing opponents nicknamed the symbol "the [[wiktionary:flash in the pan|flash in the pan]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Political Violence &amp; Public Order: A Study of British Fascism |first=Robert |last=Benewick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KENEAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP139 |page=139 |date=1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The insignia of [[Singapore]]'s [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) is composed of a red flash struck through a smaller blue circle on a white background. The PAP insignia is claimed to represent "action within social/racial unity" with the white background representing purity in thought and deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Singapore: Struggle for Success |first=John |last=Drysdale |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxH1BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP80&amp;dq=Flash+and+Circle |page=80 |date=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar logo was adopted by [[CasaPound#Youth wing|''Blocco Studentesco'']], the youth wing of Italy's [[CasaPound]] movement in 2006. The group has been accused of fascist propaganda.

==Similar non-political symbols==

The simple combination of the lightning bolt and circle elements appears to have led to many similar designs unrelated to the flash and circle. These include the logo of [[BoltBus]]. One form of warning sign for high-voltage electricity uses a lightning bolt inside a circle, and this was repurposed by [[Marilyn Manson]] as an insignia for his album ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dissecting Marilyn Manson|last=Baddeley|first=Gavin|publisher=Plexus Publishing|year=2001|isbn=0859653722|location=London|pages=101–102|quote="The insignia that represents the ''Antichrist Superstar'' album ... also echoes the insignia of Oswald Moseley's British Union of Fascists..."|via=GoogleBooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, there is no evidence to suggest that the designer intended to evoke an association with political use of the symbol.


==In popular culture==

Parodies and fictional representations of fascist movements have also incorporated logos similar to the flash and circle.

[[Image:Blackshorts.svg|thumb|right|150px|Flag of the ''Black Shorts'' used in ''[[Jeeves and Wooster]]''.]]

In the [[alternate history]] film ''[[It Happened Here]]'', the flash and circle is used as the symbol of the fascist puppet government in [[Nazi]]-occupied Britain.

In one television adaptation of the [[Jeeves]] novels by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], ''[[Jeeves and Wooster]]'', a similar insignia is used by the "Blackshorts", a political group led by [[Roderick Spode]], a character based on [[Sir Oswald Mosley]], the founder of the British Union of Fascists.

==History==
The dyke is a seven-metre-high linear bank and ditch which ran from Fulbourn to Balsham. Most of it survives and is now a footpath. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Anglo-Saxon weapons and burials were found, and the dyke was thought to have been built in the seventh century as a defence of the [[Kingdom of East Anglia]] in its wars with [[Mercia]].

An excavation in 1991 established that it had been built in several phases, the first between 330 and 510, and the last between 450 and 620. It is now believed most likely to have been built by early Anglo-Saxon settlers in the fifth century as a defence against Romano-British attempts to recover their territory.

At Mutlow Hill the dyke runs through a [[Bronze Age]] barrow, which was reused in the Roman period as a temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://frrfd.org.uk/archaeology-and-history/fleam-dyke/|title=Fleam Dyke|publisher=Friends of the Roman Road and Fleam Dyke|first=Tim|last=Malim|accessdate=  6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
[[File:Construction of Fleam Dyke.png|alt=Construction of Fleam Dyke|thumb|Construction of Fleam Dyke]]
Fleam Dyke is one of several barriers that were built along [[Icknield Way]] and [[Street Way]] by Anglo-Saxon immigrants.  Their purpose was to defend their core settlements in eastern Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk against Romano-British counterattacks in the 5th century AD.

[[Icknield Way]] may be unremarkable nowadays but it is of huge historical importance. It is certainly a pre-Roman path often claimed as the oldest in England and was later named one of the ''[[Icknield Way#The "Four Highways" of medieval England|Four Highways of medieval England]]''  on which travellers had royal protection.  To that extent, Fleam Dyke, [[Flendish Hundred]] and [[Fulbourn]] have their place in history.

==Ecology==
Fleam Dyke is one of 286 sites selected by [[Charles Rothschild]] in 1912 to 1915 as wildlife sites "worthy of preservation" in Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/aboutthearchive|title=The Rothschild Reserves: About the Archive|publisher=The Wildlife Trusts|accessdate=  6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/who-we-are/history/rothschild-reserves/fleam-dyke-cambridgeshire|title=The Rothschild Reserves: Fleam Dyke|publisher=The Wildlife Trusts|accessdate=  6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steep banks of the earthwork have species-rich chalk grassland, a rare habitat in the county. The dyke, which is maintained by grass cutting, is the only Cambridgeshire site for the [[common juniper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001069.pdf |title=Fleam Dyke citation|series= Sites of Special Scientific Interest|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=    6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Harcamlow Way]] long distance footpath runs through the site.

{{Linguistics}}
'''Generative grammar''' is a [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistic theory]] that regards [[grammar]] as a system of rules that generates exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences in a given [[language]]. [[Noam Chomsky]] first used the term in relation to the [[theoretical linguistics]] of grammar that he developed in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky’s Universal Grammar|website=thebrain.mcgill.ca|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists who follow the generative approach have been called '''generativists'''. The generative school has focused on the study of [[syntax]] and addressed other aspects of a language's structure, including [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[phonology]].

Early versions of Chomsky's theory were called [[transformational grammar]], which is still used as a general term that includes his subsequent theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.leeward.hawaii.edu/hurley/ling102web/mod4-2_syntax/4mod4.2.3_generative.htm|title=Mod 4 Lesson 4.2.3 Generative-Transformational Grammar Theory|website=www2.leeward.hawaii.edu|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent is the [[minimalist program]], from which Chomsky and other generativists have argued that many of the properties of a generative grammar arise from a [[universal grammar]] that is innate to the human brain, rather than being learned from the environment (see the [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument).

There are a number of versions of generative grammar currently practiced within linguistics. A contrasting approach is that of [[constraint-based grammar]]s. Where a generative grammar attempts to list all the rules that result in all well-formed sentences, constraint-based grammars allow anything that is not otherwise constrained. Constraint-based grammars that have been proposed include certain versions of [[dependency grammar]], [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]], [[lexical functional grammar]], [[categorial grammar]], [[relational grammar]], [[link grammar]], and [[tree-adjoining grammar]]. In [[stochastic grammar]], grammatical correctness is taken as a probabilistic variable, rather than a discrete (yes or no) property.

== Frameworks ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
There are a number of different approaches to generative grammar. Common to all is the effort to come up with a set of rules or principles that formally defines each and every one of the members of the set of well-formed expressions of a [[natural language]]. The term ''generative grammar'' has been associated with at least the following schools of linguistics:
* [[Transformational grammar]] (TG)
** Standard theory (ST)
** Extended standard theory (EST)
** Revised extended standard theory (REST)
** [[Principles and Parameters|Principles and parameters theory]] (P&amp;P)
*** [[Government and binding theory]] (GB)
*** [[Minimalist program]] (MP)
* Monostratal (or non-transformational) grammars
** [[Relational grammar]] (RG)
** [[Lexical Functional Grammar|Lexical-functional grammar]] (LFG)
** [[Generalised Phrase Structure Grammar|Generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG)
** [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG)
** [[Categorial grammar]]
** [[Tree-adjoining grammar]]

=== Historical development of models of transformational grammar ===
{{Main article|Transformational grammar}}

Although [[Leonard Bloomfield]], whose work Chomsky rejects, saw the ancient Indian grammarian Pāṇini as an antecedent of structuralism,&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard, 1929, 274; cited in Rogers, David, 1987, 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hockett, Charles, 1987, 41&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky, in an award acceptance speech delivered in India in 2001, claimed "The first generative grammar in the modern sense was [[Pāṇini|Panini]]'s grammar".

Generative grammar has been under development since the late 1950s, and has undergone many changes in the types of rules and representations that are used to predict grammaticality. In tracing the historical development of ideas within generative grammar, it is useful to refer to various stages in the development of the theory.

==== Standard theory (1957–1965) ====
The so-called standard theory corresponds to the original model of generative grammar laid out by Chomsky in 1965.

A core aspect of standard theory is the distinction between two different representations of a sentence, called [[deep structure]] and surface structure. The two representations are linked to each other by [[transformational grammar]].

==== Extended standard theory (1965–1973) ====
The so-called extended standard theory was formulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Features are:
* syntactic constraints
* generalized phrase structures ([[X-bar theory]])

==== Revised extended standard theory (1973–1976) ====
The so-called revised extended standard theory was formulated between 1973 and 1976. It contains
* restrictions upon [[X-bar theory]] (Jackendoff (1977)).
* assumption of the [[complementizer]] position.
* [[Move α]]

==== Relational grammar (ca. 1975–1990) ====
{{Main article|Relational grammar}}
An alternative model of syntax based on the idea that notions like subject, direct object, and indirect object play a primary role in grammar.

==== Government and binding/Principles and parameters theory (1981–1990) ====
{{Main article|Government and binding}}
Chomsky's ''Lectures on Government and Binding'' (1981) and ''Barriers'' (1986).

==== Minimalist program (1990–present) ====

== Context-free grammars ==
{{Main article|Context-free grammar}}
Generative grammars can be described and compared with the aid of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] (proposed by Chomsky in the 1950s). This sets out a series of types of formal grammars with increasing expressive power. Among the simplest types are the [[regular grammar]]s (type 3); Chomsky claims that these are not adequate as models for human language, because of the allowance of the [[center embedding|center-embedding]] of strings within strings, in all natural human languages.

At a higher level of complexity are the [[context-free grammar]]s (type 2). The derivation of a sentence by such a grammar can be depicted as a derivation [[tree structure|tree]]. Linguists working within generative grammar often view such trees as a primary object of study. According to this view, a sentence is not merely a string of [[words]]. Instead, adjacent words are combined into ''constituents'', which can then be further combined with other words or constituents to create a hierarchical tree-structure.

The derivation of a simple tree-structure for the sentence "the dog ate the bone" proceeds as follows. The [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] ''the'' and [[noun]] ''dog'' combine to create the [[noun phrase]] ''the dog.'' A second noun phrase ''the bone'' is created with determiner ''the'' and noun ''bone''. The verb ''ate'' combines with the second noun phrase, ''the bone,'' to create the [[verb phrase]] ''ate the bone''. Finally, the first noun phrase, ''the dog,'' combines with the verb phrase, ''ate the bone,'' to complete the sentence: ''the dog ate the bone''. The following tree diagram illustrates this derivation and the resulting structure:

[[File:Basic english syntax tree.svg]]

Such a tree diagram is also called a [[phrase marker]]. They can be represented more conveniently in text form, (though the result is less easy to read); in this format the above sentence would be rendered as:
&lt;br /&gt;[&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; The ] [&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; dog ] ] [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; ate ] [&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; the ] [&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; bone ] ] ] ]

Chomsky has argued that phrase structure grammars are also inadequate for describing natural languages, and formulated the more complex system of [[transformational grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Three models for the description of language |year=1956 |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |journal=IRE Transactions on Information Theory |volume=2 |pages=113–124 |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/195609--.pdf |doi=10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813 |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919021754/http://chomsky.info/articles/195609--.pdf |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12254">'''Guided reading''' is 'small-group reading instruction designed to provide differentiated teaching that supports students in developing reading proficiency'.&lt;ref name=PF /&gt; The small group model allows students to be taught in a way that is intended to be more focused on their specific needs, accelerating their progress.

==Introduction==
'''Guided reading''' is a method of teaching reading, common in England and Wales through the influence of the [[National Literacy Strategy]] (later superseded by the [[Primary National Strategy]]). It remains recommended practice in some authorities,&lt;ref name=LGfL /&gt; this is despite discontinued hosting and support of the [[Primary National Strategy]] from the United Kingdom's [[Department for Education]].&lt;ref name=DfE /&gt;

In the United States, Guided Reading is a key component to the Reading Workshop model of literacy instruction. Guided Reading sessions involve a teacher and a small group, ideally of two to four children although groups of five or six are not uncommon. The session would have a set of objectives to be taught during a session lasting approximately 20 minutes. While guided reading takes place with one group of children, the remaining children are engaged in quality independent or group literacy tasks, with the aim of allowing the teacher to focus the small group without interruption.  Guided Reading is usually a daily activity in English and Welsh primary school classrooms and involves every child in a class over the course of a week. In the United States, Guided Reading can take place at both the primary and intermediate levels. Each Guided Reading group meets with the teacher several times throughout a given week. The children are typically grouped by academic ability, [[Fountas and Pinnell reading levels|reading levels]], or strategic/skill-based needs.

There is a lack of research on Guided Reading, but some studies have found it to be beneficial for students. In South Africa, The Literacy Leadership Project were able to let four Foundation Phase teachers implement Guided Reading for students of the Aregorogeng Primary School. Over the course of 8 months, results were able to demonstrate an improvement in student’s engagement and motivation on literacy (Makumbila and Rowland, 2016). Another study from Canada indicated that about 80% of 25 middle school students who received Guided Reading had an increase in reading proficiency (Lyons and Thompson, 2012).

Although there are positive aspects to this type of reading instruction, there are also two main challenges that exist at every grade level. According to Irene Fountas and Gay Su Pinnell, "some students will work on very basic reading skills such as word analysis and comprehending simple texts" while other students may be working on more advanced reading skills and strategies with increasingly challenging texts.  In addition, "all students need instructional support so they can expand their competence across a greater variety of increasingly challenging texts." (Fountas and Pinnell). Thus, it takes a lot of strong planning and organization from the part of the teacher in order to successfully implement Guided Reading so that it meets the needs of all learners. Simultaneously, “a teacher’s goal is to strive to provide the most effective instruction possible and to match the difficulty of the material with the student’s current abilities. Materials should provide a challenge that is “just right” for the students” (Iaquinta, 2006). Guided Reading is a complex approach and teachers are essential in the development and execution of a [[Balanced literacy|Balanced Literacy]] program.

A critical component of the Reading Workshop is text selection; it must be purposeful and have the needs of the learners in mind. According to Fountas and Pinnell, as a teacher reads "a text in preparation for teaching, you decide what demands the text will make on the processing systems of the readers." Texts should not be chosen to simply teach a specific strategy. Rather, the texts should be of such high quality that students can apply a wide range of reading comprehension strategies throughout the reading. "One text offers many opportunities to learn; you must decide how to mediate the text to guide your students' learning experiences" (Fountas and Pinnell).

Steps for a Lesson

Before Reading: A Teacher will access background knowledge, build schema, set a purpose for reading, and preview the text with students. Typically a group will engage in a variety of pre-reading activities such as predicting, learning new vocabulary, and discussing various text features. If applicable, the group may also engage in completing a "picture walk." This activity involves scanning through the text to look at pictures and predicting how the story will go.  The students will engage in a conversation about the story, raise questions, build expectations, and notice information in the text (Fountas and Pinnell).

During Reading: The students will read independently within the group. As students read, the teacher will monitor student decoding and comprehension. The teacher may ask students if something makes sense, encourage students to try something again, or prompt them to use a strategy.  The teacher makes observational notes about the strategy use of individual readers and may also take a short running record of the child's reading.  The students may read the whole text or a part of the text silently or softly for beginning readers (Fountas and Pinnell).

After Reading: Following the reading, the teacher will again check students' comprehension by talking about the story with the children. The teacher returns to the text for teaching opportunities such as finding evidence or discussing problem solving.  The teacher also uses this time to assess the students' understanding of what they have read.  The group will also discuss reading strategies they used during the reading.  To extend the reading, students may participate in activities such as drama, writing, art, or more reading (Fountas and Pinnell).

==Features commonly found in a 'Guided Reading' session==
*'''Book Introduction'''
''Adult with group''. Prepare the children, providing support through reading the title, talking about the type of text, looking at the pictures and accessing previous knowledge. Aim to give them confidence without reading the book to them. If necessary, locate and preview difficult new words and unfamiliar concepts or names. A variety of books/genres can be used.


*'''Strategy Check'''
''Adult with group''. Introduce or review specific reading strategies that the children have been taught and remind them to use these when reading.

*'''Independent Reading'''
''Individuals''. Children read the book at their own pace. Monitor individuals and use appropriate prompts to encourage problem-solving. Praise correct use of reading strategies.

*'''Returning to the Text'''
''Adult with group''. Briefly talk about what has been read to check children's understanding. Praise correct use of reading strategies.

*'''Response to the Text'''
''Adult with group''. Encourage children to respond to the book either through a short discussion where they express opinions, or through providing follow-up activities.

*'''Re-reading Guided Text'''
"Individuals." Provide a 'familiar book' box for each group, containing texts recently used in Guided Reading. Children can re-read texts to themselves or with a partner as an independent activity to give them opportunities to develop fluency and expression and build up '[[reading miles]]'.

==Models==
There are three models of guided reading that can be used based upon the above structure depending upon the National Curriculum (NC) level that the group is reading at.  The models do overlap.

===Early Model===
This model is used for children who are reading up to about NC level 1A/2C.  In this model the book introduction, strategy check, independent reading, return to text and response to text all take place generally within one session.  This is aided by the fact that the books suitable for children reading at this stage are very short. (Baker, Bickler and Bodman)

===Transitional Model===
This model is used for children who are reading at NC level 2C to 3C/B.  Generally two guided sessions will be needed to read a book.  The first session generally focuses on the book introduction, strategy check and independent reading.  Whilst children are reading at their own pace, it is important to start to introduce an element of silent reading.  This is to develop the skills of meaning making when reading independently.  Because books at this stage are generally longer, it is not possible to read the whole book in one session.  Once the children have done some reading in the session they can be asked to read the rest of the book prior to the second session.  This session then focuses on returning to the text and responding to the text.  These are the more able children and not those at level 1

===Fluent Model===
Readers working at a NC level of 3B upwards will need the fluent model of guided reading.  Here it is not necessary for children to read the text during the guided sessions.  At these levels children can generally decode the words.  What is important is that they discuss the meaning that they make from the text which will form the basis of the discussion.  Therefore, the session tends to focus on return to text and response to the text with the strategy check implicit in the discussions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2849">'''Heinrich Wenzel''' (7 June 1855 in [[Mainz]] &amp;ndash; 16 June 1893 in [[London]]) was a German [[Indologist]] and [[Tibetologist]].

He studied at the universities of [[University of Jena|Jena]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], receiving his doctorate at the latter institution with a thesis on the [[instrumental case]] involving the [[Rigveda]] (1879). By way of a recommendation from [[Ludwig Noiré]], he continued his [[Oriental studies]] in [[Oxford University|Oxford]] under [[Max Müller]]. While here, he focused his attention on the then little-known [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan language]] and [[Tibetan literature|literature]]. From 1881 he spent the next two years in [[Herrnhut]], where he studied Tibetology with [[Moravian Church|Moravian missionary]] [[Heinrich August Jäschke]]. In 1883 Wenzel published the second edition of Jäschke's "Tibetan grammar".&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Wenzel,_Heinrich ADB:Wenzel, Heinrich] In: [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]] (ADB). Band 41, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Leipzig 1896, S. 736–738.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, he obtained his [[habilitation]] at Leipzig with a translation of [[Nāgārjuna]]'s "Suhṛllekha". Later on, he returned to England, initially residing in [[Oxford]], eventually settling in [[London]]. Among his writings were translations of works by Russian scholars. He reportedly was fluent in a dozen different languages.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;

'''Kültepe''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: "Ash Hill") is an [[archaeological site]] in [[Kayseri Province]], [[Turkey]]. The nearest modern city to Kültepe is [[Kayseri]], about 20&amp;nbsp;km southwest. It consists of a [[tell (archaeology)|tell]], the actual Kültepe, and a lower town, where an [[Assyria]]n settlement was found. Its name in Assyrian texts from the 20th century BC was '''Kaneš'''; the later [[Hittites]] mostly called it '''Neša''', occasionally '''Aniša'''. In 2014 the archaeological site was inscribed in the [[List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_Turkey_(Tentative_list)|Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archaeological Site of Kültepe-Kanesh |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5905/ | website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre | accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the site of discovery of the earliest traces of the [[Hittite language]], and the earliest attestation of any [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]], written in [[Akkadian language|Old Assyrian]], dated to the 20th century BC.

==History==
[[File:Kültepe Höyüğü.jpg|thumb|View from lower town to the actual tell]] 
Kaneš, inhabited continuously from the [[Chalcolithic]] to Roman times, flourished as an important [[Hattians|Hattian]], [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] city, containing a large [[karum (trade post)|''kārum'']] (merchant colony) of the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] from c. the 21st to 18th centuries BC. This ''kārum'' appears to have served as "the administrative and distribution centre of the entire Assyrian colony network in Anatolia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryce |first=Trevor |date= 2005|title=Kingdom of the Hittites: New Edition |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=37 |isbn=0199281327 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A late (c. 1400 BC) witness to an old tradition includes a king of Kaneš called Zipani among seventeen local city-kings who rose up against [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]] (ruled c. 2254-2218 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Bryce 2005, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Kaneša===
[[File:VAM - Gießgefäß.jpg|thumb|Animal shaped rhyton from Kanesh (19th century BC) [[Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin]]]]

The king of [[Zalpuwa]], Uhna, raided Kanes, after which the Zalpuwans carried off the city's ''Šiuš'' idol. [[Pithana]], the king of [[Kussara]], conquered Neša "in the night, by force", but "did no evil to anyone in it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuhrt |first=Amélie |date=1995 |title=The Ancient Near East, Volume I |location=London and New York |publisher=Routledge |page=226 |isbn=0-415-16763-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neša revolted against the rule of Pithana's son, [[Anitta]], but Anitta quashed the revolt and made Neša his capital. Anitta further invaded Zalpuwa, captured its king [[Huzziya]], and recovered the ''Šiuš'' idol for Neša.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/eieol/hitol-1-R.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century BC, Anitta's descendants moved their capital to [[Hattusa]], which Anitta had cursed, thus founding the [[list of Hittite kings|line of Hittite kings]]. The inhabitants thus referred to the [[Hittite language]] as ''Nešili'', "the language of Neša".

== Archaeology ==
[[File:KarumKanis.svg|thumb|Central Anatolia during the ''[[karum (trade post)|karum]]''-period]]
In 1925, [[Bedřich Hrozný]] excavated Kültepe and found over 1000 cuneiform tablets, some of which ended up in [[Prague]] and in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;Julius Lewy, ''Die altassyrischen Texte vom Kültepe bei Kaisarije'', Konstantinopel, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Veysel Donbaz, ''Keilschrifttexte in den Antiken-Museen zu Stambul 2'', Freiburger Altorientalische Studien, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern archaeological work began in 1948, when Kültepe was excavated by a team from the Turkish Historical Society and the General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums. The team was led by [[Tahsin Özgüç]] until his death, in 2005.
&lt;ref&gt;Tahsin Özgüç, The Palaces and Temples of Kultepe-Kanis/Nesa, Turk Tarih Kurumu Basimevi, 1999, {{ISBN|975-16-1066-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Level IV-III'''.  Little excavation has been done for these levels, which represent the kârum's first habitation (Mellaart 1957). No writing is attested, and archaeologists assume that both levels' inhabitants were illiterate.
* '''Level II''', 1974 BC - 1836 BC (Mesopotamian Middle Chronology according to Veenhof). Craftsmen of this time and place specialised in animal-shaped earthen drinking vessels, which were often used for religious rituals. Assyrian merchants then established a merchant colony (''kârum'') attached to the city, which was called "Kaneš". Bullae of [[Naram-Suen of Eshnunna|Naram-Sin]] of [[Eshnunna]] have been found toward the end of this level (Ozkan 1993), which was burned to the ground.
* '''Level Ib''', 1798 BC - 1740 BC. After an interval of abandonment, the city was rebuilt over the ruins of the old and again became a prosperous trade center. The trade was under the control of [[Ishme-Dagan I]], who was put in control of Assur when his father, [[Shamshi-Adad I]], conquered Ekallatum and Assur. However, the colony was again destroyed by fire.
* '''Level Ia'''. The city was reinhabited, but the Assyrian colony was no longer inhabited. The culture was early [[Hittites|Hittite]]. Its name in Hittite became "Kaneša", which was more commonly contracted to "Neša".

Some attribute Level II's burning to the conquest of the city of [[Assur]] by the kings of [[Eshnunna]], but Bryce blames it on the raid of [[Uhna]]. Some attribute Level Ib's burning to the fall of Assur, other nearby kings and eventually to [[Hammurabi]] of Babylon.

To date, over 20,000 cuneiform tablets have been recovered from the site.

=== Kârum Kaneš ===
The quarter of the city that most interests historians is the ''kārum'', a portion of the city that was, during the Chalcolithic, set aside by local officials for the early Assyrian merchants to use without paying taxes as long as the goods remained inside the ''kārum''. The term ''kārum'' means "port" in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], the ''lingua franca'' of the time, but its meaning was later extended to refer to any trading colony whether or not it bordered water.

Several other cities in Anatolia also had a ''kārum'', but the largest was Kaneš, whose important ''kārum'' was inhabited by soldiers and merchants from [[Assyria]] for hundreds of years. They traded local tin and wool for luxury items, foodstuffs, spices and woven fabrics from the Assyrian homeland and [[Elam]].

The remains of the ''kārum'' form a large circular mound 500&amp;nbsp;m in diameter and about 20&amp;nbsp;m above the plain (a tell). The ''kārum'' settlement is the result of several superimposed stratigraphic periods. New buildings were constructed on top of the remains of the earlier periods so there is a deep [[stratigraphy]] from prehistoric times to the early Hittite period.

The ''kārum'' was destroyed by fire at the end of both levels II and Ib. The inhabitants left most of their possessions behind, to be found by modern archaeologists.

The findings have included numerous baked-clay tablets, some of which were enclosed in clay envelopes stamped with [[cylinder seal]]s. The documents record common activities, such as trade between the Assyrian colony and the city-state of [[Assur]] and between Assyrian merchants and local people. The trade was run by families rather than the state. The '''Kültepe texts''' are the oldest documents from Anatolia. Although they are written in Old Assyrian, the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] loanwords and names in the texts are the oldest record of any Indo-European language (see also [[Ishara]]). Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use of both cuneiform and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence.

=== Dating of Waršama Sarayi ===
At Level II, the destruction was so total that no wood survived for [[dendrochronology|dendrochronological studies]]. In 2003, researchers from [[Cornell University]] dated wood in level Ib from the rest of the city, built centuries earlier. The dendrochronologists date the bulk of the wood from buildings of the Waršama Sarayi to 1832 BC, with further refurbishments up to 1779 BC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arts.cornell.edu/dendro/TUBA-ARCaptured.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=April 2008}}
A '''labialized velar''' or labiovelar is a [[velar consonant]] that is [[labialization|labialized]], with a /w/-like [[secondary articulation]]. Common examples are {{IPA|[kʷ, ɡʷ, xʷ, ŋʷ]}}, which are pronounced like a {{IPA|[k, ɡ, x, ŋ]}}, with rounded lips, such as the [[labialized voiceless velar plosive]] {{IPA|[kʷ]}}. Such sounds occur across Africa and the Americas, in the Caucasus, etc.

==Labialized velar approximants==
The most common labiovelar consonant is the voiced approximant {{IPA|[w]}}. It is normally a labialized velar, as is its vocalic cousin {{IPA|[u]}}. (Labialization is called [[rounded vowel|rounding]] in vowels, and a velar place is called [[back vowel|back]].)

However, languages such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and perhaps the Northern [[Iroquoian languages]] have something closer to a true [[labial–velar approximant]] in which the lips come together. In close transcription, the symbol {{IPA|[w]}} may be then avoided or used with an under-rounding diacritic: {{IPA|[w̜]}}.

{{IPA|[w]}} and its voiceless equivalent are the only labialized velars with dedicated IPA symbols:

| '[[wiktionary:witch|witch]]'
|}

* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; - In [[List of dialects of the English language|dialect]]s that distinguish between ''which'' and ''witch''.

The voiceless approximant is traditionally called a "voiceless labial–velar fricative", but true [[doubly articulated consonant|doubly articulated]] fricatives are not known to be used in any language, as they are quite difficult to pronounce and even more difficult to distinguish. (The symbol {{IPA|[ʍ]}} is very occasionally used for a labialized velar fricative, {{IPA|[xʷ]}} even if that usage is not approved by the [[International Phonetic Association|IPA]].)

==Historical development==
Labialized velars frequently derive from a plain velar followed by a [[roundedness|rounded]] (labialized) vowel, such as {{IPA|[u]}} or {{IPA|[o]}}. In turn, they may sometimes develop into simple [[bilabial consonant]]s. An example of this is the [[Indo-European sound laws|development of Proto-Indo-European]] *kʷ, *gʷ before *a or *o into [[Greek language|Greek]]  /p, b/, producing cognates as different as English ''come'' and ''basis''. The full sequence is demonstrated by the [[Satsuma dialect]] of Japanese: in northern Satsuma, Standard Japanese {{IPA|[kue]}} 'eat!' has contracted to {{IPA|[kʷe]}}; in southern Satsuma, it has proceeded further to {{IPA|[pe]}}.

A notable development is the initial *kʷ in [[Proto-Indo-European]] [[interrogative word]]s. In English, it developed into ''[[wh (digraph)|wh]]'' or ''h'' (''how''), pronounced /w/ in most dialects and /h/, respectively, via [[Grimm's law]] followed by [[wh-cluster reductions|''wh''-cluster reductions]]. By contrast, in [[Latin]] and its descendents, the [[Romance languages]], that developed into ''[[qu (digraph)|qu]]'' (later Spanish ''cu'' (''cuando'') and ''c'' (''como'')), pronounced variously as /kw/ or /k/. See [[Interrogative word#Etymology|etymology of English interrogative words]] for details. The English [[phonemic spelling]] ''[[kw (digraph)|kw]]'' for ''qu'' (as in ''[[wikt:kwik|kwik]]'') echoes its origin.

'''Languaculture''' is a term meaning that a [[language]] includes not only elements such as grammar and vocabulary, but also past knowledge, local and cultural information, habits and behaviours. The term was created by the American anthropologist [[Michael Agar]].

==Meaning==
Agar used the term "languaculture" for the first time in his essay ''Language Shock: Understanding the culture of conversation''. Languaculture is an adjustment of the term "linguaculture", suggested by the American [[linguistic anthropologist]] Paul Friedrich. Agar explains the [[vowel change]] stating that language is a more commonly used word.

When Agar talks about languaculture, he defines it as the necessary tie between language and [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Agar, Michael,|year=1995|title=''[[Language Shock: Understanding the culture of conversation]]''|location=New York|publisher=William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underlines that languages and cultures are always closely related and it is not possible to distinguish languages from cultures. Therefore, you cannot really know a language if you do not know also the culture expressed by that language.

The notion of culture and its understanding involve the link between two different languacultures that Agar define LC1 (source languaculture) and LC2 (target languaculture).

==Rich points==
{{Inappropriate person|section|date=August 2016}}The learning of target languaculture is driven by "rich points". We realize that a culture is different from ours when we face some behaviours which we do not understand. Rich points are those surprises, those departures from an outsider’s expectations that signal a difference between source languaculture and target languaculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agar, Michael|title=Culture: Can You Take It Anywhere?|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Methods|year=2006|volume=5|issue=2|article=XX}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the moments of incomprehension, when you suddenly do not know what is happening. In this situation different reactions are possible. You can ignore the rich point and hope that the next part makes sense. You can perceive it as evidence that the person who produced it has some lacks. Or you can wonder why you do not understand and if maybe some other languaculture comes into play. Therefore, rich points belong to daily life and not only to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Agar, Michael,|year=1995|title=Language Shock: Understanding the culture of conversation | location=New York|publisher=William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agar highlights that the term ''rich'' has the positive connotations of thickness, wealth and abundance. The largest rich point is the total incomprehension due to huge differences between source languaculture and target languaculture. In this case we are facing a ‘culture shock’ that causes a deep bewilderment. The smallest rich point can occur among different groups of the same community.
The existence of rich points comes from the fact that every statement implicitly refers to various elements that are taken for granted in a certain culture and do not match the elements of another culture (cultural implicitness).

==Culture in languaculture==
According to Agar, culture is a construction, a translation between source languaculture and target languaculture. Like a [[translation]], it makes no sense to talk about the culture of X without saying the culture of X for Y, taking into account the standpoint from which it is observed. For this reason culture is relational.
Moreover, culture is always plural. No person or group can be described, explained or generalized completely with a single cultural label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agar, Michael|title=Culture: Can You Take It Anywhere?|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Methods|year=2006|volume=5|issue=2|article=XX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lillian Sara Robinson''' (April 18, 1941 – September 20, 2006) was a [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminist]] [[activism|activist]], [[writer]], and [[Theory|theorist]]. She was the principal of the [[Simone de Beauvoir Institute]] and professor of [[Women's studies]] at [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] at the time of her death. She is described as "revolutionary, Marxist, and feminist...an activist student".&lt;ref&gt;
Robinson, Lillian. "Treason our Text: Feminist Challenges to the Literary Canon". ''Critical Theory since 1965''. Eds. Adams, Hazard and Searle, Leroy. Tallahassee: Florida State University Press, 1986. 571-582.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Robinson grew up in [[New York City]], the child of [[Jewish people|Jewish]] immigrants. She earned a B.A./M.A. degree at [[Brown University]] in 1962, and a Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]]. Her dissertation was published in 1985. Throughout her life, Robinson was actively involved in various civil and human rights struggles. She marched against the [[Vietnam War|US war in Vietnam]], [[racism]], and, shortly before her death, also worked with the ''Jewish Alliance Against the Occupation'' branch in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada.

Her work in women's studies was groundbreaking for its time. She insisted that "gender could not usefully be studied except in relationship to race and class".&lt;ref&gt;
Atkinson, Clarissa. "Making the Case for Socialist-Feminism: Lillian Robinson, 1941-2006. ''Women's Review of Books''. Vol. 24, No. 2. March/April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Her views on this matter are expounded upon in her work ''Sex, Class, and Culture''. A particularly noteworthy article in this book on the importance of examining race and class is "Who's Afraid of a Room of One's Own?" in which she discusses developments in the realm of sexuality and politics as it pertains to women since [[Virginia Woolf]]'s time. She argues that class plays a much greater role in determining what kind of place and identity a woman has in society, which was not thoroughly examined in Woolf's work ''[[A Room of One's Own]]''. She also argues that the sexual freedom that women have gained since the sexual revolution has come at a cost, that in fact "permission to be unchaste has not freed women from the object-role we occupied when it was chastity that was the valued commodity".&lt;ref&gt;
Robinson, Lillian. "Who's Afraid of A Room of One's Own?" ''Sex, Class, and Culture''. New York and London: Methuen, 1978. 97-149&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Robinson was Poet in Residence at [[Albright College]] in Reading Pennsylvania during the 1984–1985 academic year.

Lillian Robinson died of ovarian cancer in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on September 20, 2006.

A '''limited edition book''' is a book that is released in a limited quantity print run, usually much smaller than publishing industry standards, usually less than 1000 copies. The term connotes a level of scarcity or exclusivity. A limited edition book of more than about 1000 copies is misleading as it would be much less likely in general to become scarce.

The term also implies that no further additional printings of the book will be released with the same design treatment, unlike open-ended trade editions wherein further copies may be released in more print runs as the first and subsequent printings are sold out.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, John (1998). ABC for Book Collectors (7th ed., revised by Nicholas Barker). New Castle, Delaware: Oak Knoll Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited edition books may also be numbered or lettered to distinguish in that set each book. For example, a numbered, limited book could have a marking such as "Copy 1 of a limited edition of 250 copies" or "1/250". Much less common is the lettered limited edition book that could have denotations such as "1 of 26" or "1/26" or "A of 26" or "Copy A", etc. Sometimes a copy of a limited edition book is stated as being "out of series": this is an unnumbered copy, often a review copy.

Limited edition books are also sometimes signed by the [[author]], [[illustrator]] and/or other contributors to make them more exclusive and collectible. In some instances, the limited edition version contains additional material not found in the mass market (or trade) version of the book. Likewise, they are sometimes housed in [[slipcase]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5627">A '''dependent United States visa''' is a type of [[Visa (document)|visa]] which allows spouses and children to travel to the [[United States]] for the purpose of accompanying a family member with a corresponding visa type. While many visa classes have their own dependent visa, others do not. Some of these require all family members to apply for the same visa class, such as [[E-2 visa|E-2]] and [[C-2 visa|C-2]] visas. Others such as the [[D-1 visa]] do not allow travel for dependents at all.&lt;ref name=pocket/&gt; Certain restrictions apply depending on the type of dependent visa an individual is seeking.

The dependent visa classes are as follows:

* [[CW-2 visa]] - for dependents of those admitted on a [[CW-1 visa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2504">In [[linguistics]], [[language]]s are often studied in terms of six major subsystems, which relate to major subfields within linguistics. In addition, particular subfields of linguistic inquiry may divide their subject matter into more specific subsystems. This list contains links to commonly studied language subsystems.

== Major subsystems ==

Linguists recognize seven major language subsystems:

* [[Phonetics]], the [[sound]]s of human [[speech]], including their physiological production, acoustic properties, auditory perception, and neurophysiological status;
* [[Phonology]], the systematic use of sound to encode meaning in any spoken [[human language]] ([[natural language]] or [[constructed language]]);
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]], the structure of meaningful units of a language, such as [[word]]s and [[affix]]es;
* [[Syntax]], the principles and rules for constructing [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, and the like in human languages;
* [[Semantics]], the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaningful]] content of words, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], or other language elements;
* [[Pragmatics]], the ways in which [[Context (language use)|context]] contributes to meaning in natural language use; and
* [[Lexicology]], the study of words.

This division varies among linguists and authors. For example, phonetics and phonology are occasionally merged into one subsystem. Morphology and lexicology can also be merged.

== Sociolinguistics ==

* The term ''[[Variety (linguistics)|variety]]'' in [[sociolinguistics]] is used as a cover term for dialects, registers, and other forms of language, including standard languages.
** [[Dialect]] refers to a variety that is used by a particular group of speakers.
** [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|Accent]] refers to a specific system of pronunciation.
** [[Idiolect]] refers to the variety that is used by an individual speaker.
** [[Register (sociolinguistics)|Register]] or [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]] refer to a variety that is used in a particular setting or for a particular purpose.
** [[Standard language]] is a variety promoted by some social group, either officially or unofficially, as the preferred form.
* [[Abstand and ausbau languages]] are concepts developed by sociolinguists to describe related language varieties, ranging from dialects of a single language to distinct languages.

[[File:Loathly lady.jpg||thumb|The loathly lady in an illustration for Maud Isabel Ebbutt's ''Hero-Myths and Legends of the British Race'' (1910)]]

The '''loathly lady''' (Motif D732 in [[Aarne-Thompson tale-type|Stith Thompson's motif index]]), is a tale type commonly used in [[medieval literature]], most famously in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Wife of Bath's Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garry|first1=Jane|last2=El-Shamy|first2=Hasan|title=Archetypes and Motifs in Folklore and Literature|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2005|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cn6pWMverBIC&amp;pg=PA130|isbn=978-0-7656-2953-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif is that of a woman who appears unattractive (ugly, ''loathly'') but undergoes a transformation upon being approached by a man in spite of her unattractiveness, becoming extremely desirable. It is then revealed that her ugliness was the result of a [[curse]] which was broken by the hero's action.

== Irish legend ==
The loathly lady can be found in ''The Adventures of the Sons of [[Eochaid Mugmedon]]'', in which [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]] proves himself the rightful [[High King of Ireland]] by embracing her, because she turns out to personify the sovereignty of the territory (and is therefore sometimes referred in scholarship as a '[[sovereignty goddess]]'). The motif can also be found in stories of the earlier high kings [[Lugaid Loígde]] and [[Conn of the Hundred Battles]].

=== Diarmuid ===
In the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]], [[Diarmuid Ua Duibhne]] was one of the most famous members of the [[Fianna]]. One freezing winter's night, the Loathly Lady brazenly entered the Fianna lodge, where the warriors had just gone to bed after a hunting expedition. Drenched to the bone, her sodden hair was snarled and knotted. Desperate for warmth and shelter, she knelt beside each warrior and demanded a blanket, beginning with their leader Fionn. Despite her rants and temper tantrums, the tired men only rolled over and ignored her in the hope that she would leave. Only young Diarmuid, whose bed was nearest to the fireplace, took pity on the wretched woman, giving her his bed and blanket. The Loathly Lady noticed Diarmuid's love spot and said that she had wandered the world alone for 7 years. Diarmuid reassured her and told her she could sleep all night and that he would protect her. Towards dawn, he became aware that she had become a beautiful young woman.

The next day, the Loathly Lady rewarded Diarmuid's kindness by offering him his greatest wish—a house overlooking the sea. Overjoyed, Diarmuid asked the woman to live with him. She agreed on one condition: He must promise never to mention how ugly she looked on the night they met. After 3 days together, Diarmuid grew restless. The Loathly Lady offered to watch his greyhound and her new pups while he went hunting. On three separate occasions, Diarmuid's friends, envious of his good luck, visited the lady and asked for one of the new pups. Each time, she honoured the request. Each time, Diarmuid was angry and asked her how she could repay him so meanly when he overlooked her ugliness the first night they met. On the third mention of that which he had promised never to speak of, the Loathly Lady and the house disappeared, and his beloved greyhound died.

Realizing that his ungratefulness has caused him to lose everything he valued, Diarmuid set out to find his lady. He used an enchanted ship to cross a stormy sea. Arriving in the Otherworld, he searched for the lady through green meadows filled with brightly coloured horses and silver trees. Three times he spied a drop of ruby-red blood and gathered each drop into his handkerchief. When a stranger revealed that the King's gravely ill daughter had just returned after 7 years, Diarmuid realised it must be his lady. Rushing to her side, he discovered she was dying. The 3 drops of blood Diarmuid collected were from her heart, spilled each time she thought of Diarmuid. The only cure was a cup of healing water from the Plain of Wonder, guarded by a jealous king and his army. Diarmuid vowed to bring back the cup.

His quest for the healing cup nearly ended at an impassable river. Diarmuid was stumped until the Red Man of All Knowledge, who had red hair and eyes like glowing coals, helped him cross the river and then guided him to the king of the healing cup's castle. Once there, Diarmuid issued a challenge and in response the king first sent out one thousand six hundred fighting men, then one thousand eight hundred. Diarmuid single-handedly slew them all.&lt;ref&gt;Gienna Matson．Celtic Mythology A to Z．New York：Chelsea House，2004：P.75&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed, the king gave him the cup of healing. On the return trip, the Red Man advised Diarmuid on how to heal his lady. He also warned the young hero that when her sickness ended, Diarmuid's love for her would end as well. Diarmuid refused to believe the prophecy, but indeed, it came true. The lady sadly understood that Diarmuid's love for her had died. She couldn't live in his world any more than he could live in hers. Diarmuid boarded an enchanted ship to return to the Fianna, where he was greeted by his friends and his greyhound, which the lady had returned to life as her final gift to him.

== Arthurian/British legend ==
In her capacity as a quest-bringer, the loathly lady can be found in the literature of the [[Holy Grail]], including [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'', [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]'', and the [[Welsh Romance]] ''[[Peredur, son of Efrawg]]'' associated with the ''[[Mabinogion]]''. The motif also appears in [[Wolfram von Eschenbac]]h's Middle High German romance ''[[Parzival]]'' in the character of Cundrie, the messenger of the Grail.

The theme became a staple of [[Arthurian]] literature; the best known treatment is in [[the Wife of Bath's Tale]], in which a knight, told that he can choose whether his bride is to be ugly yet faithful, or beautiful yet false, frees the lady from the form entirely by allowing her to choose for herself. A variation on this story is attached to [[Sir Gawain]] in the related romances ''[[The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle]]'' and ''[[The Marriage of Sir Gawain]]''. 

Another version of the motif is the [[ballad]] [[King Henry (song)|King Henry]]. In this ballad, the king must appease the loathly lady as she demands increasing tribute from him. The next morning, he is surprised as she transforms into a beautiful woman.

== Norse tradition ==
The loathly lady also appears in the [[Old Norse]] ''[[Hrólfr Kraki's saga]]'' where [[Hroðgar|Hróarr]]'s brother [[Halga|Helgi]]  was visited one [[Yule]] by an ugly being while he was in his hunting house. No person in the entire kingdom allowed the being to enter the house, except Helgi. Later, the thing asked to sleep in his bed. Unwillingly he agreed, and as the thing got into the bed, it turned into an [[Elf|elvish]] woman, who was clad in silk and who was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He raped her, and made her pregnant with a daughter named [[Skuld (princess)|Skuld]]. Helgi forgot the woman and a couple of days after the date had passed, he was visited by the woman, who had Skuld in her arms. The daughter would later marry [[Heoroweard|Hjörvarðr]], [[Hrólfr Kraki]]'s killer. This tradition is also present in the Northumbrian tale [[The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh]]. Similar to this tale, is that of [[Hjálmþés saga ok Ölvis]].

== The Canterbury Tales: "The Wife of Bath's Tale" ==
The tale told by The Wife of Bath in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is one of the most prominent examples of the loathly lady motif. The story begins during the rule of King Arthur over the Isle of Britain.  It was a time when the people of the Isle of Britain were terrorized by friars who raped women.  Instead of getting the women pregnant like the incubus did in the past, the Friars solely brought shame upon them without impregnating them.  The plot of the story begins when a Knight of King Arthur's court rapes a young woman when he is overpowered by his lust for her.  The King and his court then come to the conclusion that decapitation is a punishment fit for the crime at hand, however the decision is intercepted by the Queen and women of the court before it can be executed.  The women persuade the King to grant him another chance on one condition.  They propose that if the Knight can find what women desire most from their partners and report it back to them in time, then the Knight will keep his head.  King Arthur then proceeds to accept the women's punishment and grants the knight this second chance.  The Knight quickly seizes this opportunity and sets out on a journey that becomes more difficult than he first anticipated.  Early in his quest the Knight comes to realize that each woman he questions seems to give him a different answer than the last.  As the Knight's time begins to run out, he comes across a group of young women dancing and sets out to question them as well.  But as the Knight draws near, to his dismay, the group vanishes and turns into a "loathly" old woman (a [[hag]]), who offers to help him with his dilemma.  The old woman joins the Knight on his quest back and aids him in giving the answer to the women of the court.  Together, the Knight and the Loathly Lady tell the women of the court that women desire sovereignty the most in their love life: women want to be treated as equal partners in their love relationships.  The Wife of Bath continues with her tale and says that the loathly woman asks the knight to marry her in return for helping him.  The knight submits to the hag's request although he pleads for her to take his material wealth instead.  They marry and consummate the marriage that very night.  When the old woman realizes how unhappy the Knight is she asks him why he is so sorrowful and he tells her that he is unhappy to have married such an unattractive wife.  The wife responds to this comment by giving the Knight a choice: either he can have an old, unattractive, yet loyal wife or a young and beautiful wife that will be unfaithful to him.  The knight decides to let his wife choose, and she transforms instead into a wife both beautiful and loyal, because he gave her the sovereignty to choose. The moral that the Wife of Bath is attempting to get across is that a woman's greatest wish is the same as a man's: to be loved as an autonomous equal within a relationship. Geoffrey Chaucer shook the ideology associated with gender roles in the fourteenth century. Women in the middle ages were seen as subordinates to men in all situations including marriage, with some rare exceptions, and the idea of women having control in male/female relationships was unpopular. Marriage was a concrete and exclusive bond between husband and wife, in which wives had to submit to their husband's authority in all matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McDougall |first=Sara |year=2013 |chapter=Women and Gender in Canon Law |pages=163–178 |title=Oxford Handbook of Women and Gender in Medieval Europe |editors=Judith Bennett and Ruth Mazo Karras |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-958217-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the popularity that Chaucer gained in the Middle Ages, his concept of an authoritative woman in his literary works helped redefine (along with the help of historical figures such as [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Joan of Arc]]) the way Middle Age society regarded women. The theme of the loathly lady opposed the norms of a patriarchal society and played a role in the beginnings of a feminist critique. Geoffrey Chaucer's Wife of Bath was a critical voice that contrasted with the society that he lived in.  Using the loathly lady legend, she shapes the moral of her story to be that women always need control over themselves and should be allowed to exercise this privilege. This caught the attention of many scholars, which along with the other moral satires of Chaucer's writings, enabled it to be passed on to affect the ideologies of new generations.

'''Louisiana Creole''' (''{{lang|lou|kréyol la lwizyàn}}''; {{lang-fr|créole louisianais}}), also called '''Louisiana French Creole''', is a [[French-based creole languages|French-based creole]] language spoken by far fewer than 10,000 people, mostly in the state of [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apics-online.info/contributions/53|title=APiCS Online -|website=apics-online.info|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the rapidly shrinking number of speakers, Louisiana Creole is considered an [[endangered language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/lou|title=Louisiana Creole|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins &amp; Historical Development==

[[Louisiana]] was founded and populated by French Immigrants from Canada and France. The colony was established by the Iberville brothers at the headwater of the Mississippi River in 1699.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klinger|first=Thomas A.|last2=Neumann-Holzschuh|first2=Ingrid|date=2013|editor-last=Michaelis|editor-first=Susanne Maria|editor2-last=Maurer|editor2-first=Phillippe|editor3-last=Haspelmath|editor3-first=Martin|editor4-last=Huber|editor4-first=Magnus|title="Louisiana Creole."|url=|journal=The Survey of Pidgin and Creole Languages Volume II: Portuguese-based, Spanish-based, and French-based Languages.|location=UK|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=|pages=229-40|via=UBC Okanagan Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French colonists were small-scale homesteaders and cattle ranchers who had little success in garnering forced free labour from the Indigenous peoples that inhabited the area; this created a perceived need to import African slaves.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; It is estimated that a total of 5,500 individuals were brought over from the [[Senegambia]] region of West Africa beginning in about 1719. These people originally spoke a Mande language related to [[Malinke]] and they were in contact with other languages such as [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Kongo language|Kikongo]]. The importation of slaves by the French regime continued until 1743.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Louisiana Creole is a contact language that arose in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century from interactions between speakers of the lexifier language of [[Louisiana Creole people|Standard French and several substrate or adstrate languages from Africa]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=If I Could Turn My Tongue Like That: The Creole Language of Pointe Coupee parish, Louisiana.|last=Klinger|first=Thomas A.|publisher=Louisiana State University|year=2003|isbn=|location=Louisiana|pages=3-92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; [P]rior to its establishment as a Creole, the precursor was considered a [[pidgin]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubois|first=Sylvie|last2=Melançon|first2=Megan|date=2000|title="Creole is, Creole Ain't: Diachronic and Synchronic Attitudes Toward Creole Identity in Southern Louisiana."|url=|journal=Language in Society|volume=29|pages=237-58|via=UBC Okanagan Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social situation that gave rise to the Louisiana Creole language was unique, in that the lexifier language was the language found at the contact site. More often the lexifier is the language that arrives at the contact site belonging to the substrate/adstrate languages. Neither the French, French-Canadians, or African slaves were native to the area; this fact categorizes Louisiana Creole as a contact language that arose between exogenous ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles, &amp; Mixed Languages|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company.|year=2015|isbn=|location=Amsterdam|pages=48-50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the pidgin tongue was transmitted to the next generation as a ''lingua franca'' (who were then considered the first native speakers of the new grammar), it could effectively be classified as a [[creole language]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

The boundaries of historical Louisiana were shared by the Spaniards and the Anglo-Americans. By the time of the Louisiana Purchase by the U.S in 1803, the boundaries came to include most of the Central U.S, ranging from present day Montana; parts of North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado; all of South Dakota, Nebraksa, and Kansas; part of Southeast Texas; all of Oklahoma; most of Missouri and Arkansas; as well as Louisiana.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wendte|first=N.A|date=2018|title=“Language and Identity Among Louisiana Creoles in Southeast Texas: Initial Observations."|url=|journal=Southern Journal of Linguistics|volume=42|pages=1-16|via=UBC Okanagan Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first document found to acknowledge the existence of the Louisiana Creole was a transcript from a murder trial in 1978.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;  The documentation does not include any examples of orthography or structure.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

In a document that is dated from 1807, a grammatical description of the language is included in the experiences of a woman named Robin, prior the arrival of Saint-Domingue Indigenous immigrants. The statements collected from the slave showed linguistic features that are now known to be typical of Louisiana Creole.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

“Criollo” appeared in a legal court document dated 1972; the Spanish reference to the language stated that the language was used among slaves and whites. &lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

Slavery of Africans intensified with the surrender of the colony to Spain in 176; there were few Spaniards who came to live in the colony. At this time Louisiana exhibited a unique demographic feature; the colony population of minorities greatly outnumbered the settlers.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==Language shift, endangerment and revitalization==
In the case of Louisiana Creole, a ''[[diglossia]]'' resulted between Louisiana Creole and Plantation Society French (PSF) also known as ''[[Colonial French]]''. The latter was frequently associated with plantation owners, plantation overseers, small landowners, military officers/soldiers and bilingual, [[free people of color]]. Over the centuries, Louisiana Creole's negative associations with slavery have stigmatized the language to the point where many speakers are reluctant to use it for fear of ridicule. In this way, the assignment of "high" variety (or H language) was allotted to PSF and that of "low" variety (or L language) was given to Louisiana Creole (please refer to [[diglossia]] for more information on H and L languages).&lt;ref name="Carlisle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlisle|first1=Aimee Jeanne|title=Language Attrition in Louisiana Creole French|url=http://linguistics.ucdavis.edu/pics-and-pdfs/Honors%20Thesis%20Aimee%20Carlisle.pdf|website=linguistics.ucdavis.edu|publisher=University of California, Davis|accessdate=March 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social status of Louisiana Creole further declined as a result of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The promise of upward socioeconomic mobility prompted many speakers of Louisiana Creole to abandon their stigmatised language in favor of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Becky|title=The Social Consequences of Writing Louisiana French|date=March 1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=68–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the development of industry, technology and infrastructure in Louisiana reduced the isolation of Louisiana Creolophone communities and resulted in the arrival of more English-speakers, resulting in further exposure to English. Because of this, Louisiana Creole exhibits extensive influence from English, including [[loanword]]s, [[code-switching]] and [[Calque|syntactic calquing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valdman|first1=ed. by Albert|title=French and Creole in Louisiana|date=1997|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-306-45464-5|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le créole de Breaux Bridge, Louisiane: étude morphosyntaxique, textes, vocabulaire|last=Neumann|first=Ingrid|publisher=Helmut Buske Verlag|year=1985|isbn=9783871186974|location=Hamburg|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Louisiana Creole is spoken by fewer than 10,000 people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though national census data includes figures on language usage, these are often unreliable in Louisiana due to respondents' tendencies to identify their language in line with their ethnic identity. For example, speakers of Louisiana Creole who identify as [[Cajuns]] often label their language 'Cajun French', though on linguistic grounds their language would be considered Louisiana Creole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klingler|first=Thomas A.|date=2003|title=Language labels and language use among Cajuns and Creoles in Louisiana|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/pwpl/vol9/iss2/8/|journal=University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics|volume=9|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to revitalize French in Louisiana have placed emphasis on ''[[Cajun French]]'', to the exclusion of Creole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Squint|first=Kirstin L.|date=2005-05-04|title=A Linguistic Comparison of Haitian Creole and Louisiana Creole|url=http://postcolonial.org/index.php/pct/article/view/375|journal=Postcolonial Text|language=en|volume=1|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, community organisations such as CREOLE, Inc. have led a handful of community-level efforts to promote the language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; CREOLE, Inc., for example, has organised a 'Creole Table' in St. Martinville, as well as a number of other language-focused events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.louisianacreoleinc.org/about-us.html|title=About Us|website=www.louisianacreoleinc.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is an active online community of language-learners and activists engaged in language revitalization, led by [[language activist]] Christophe Landry.&lt;ref&gt;Mayeux, Oliver. 2015.

==Geographic distribution==
Speakers of Louisiana Creole are mainly concentrated in south and southwest Louisiana, where the population of Creolophones is distributed across the region. [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana|St. Martin Parish]] forms the heart of the Creole-speaking region. Other sizeable communities exist along [[Bayou Teche|Bayou Têche]] in [[St. Landry Parish, Louisiana|St. Landry]], [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana|Avoyelles]], [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia]], and [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary]] Parishes. There are smaller communities on [[False River (Louisiana)|False River]] in [[Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana|Pointe-Coupée Parish]], in [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebone Parish]], and along the lower Mississippi River in [[Ascension Parish, Louisiana|Ascension]], [[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana|St. Charles Parish]], and [[St. James Parish, Louisiana|St. James]] and [[St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana|St. John the Baptist]] parishes.&lt;ref&gt;Kirstin Squint, [http://postcolonial.org/index.php/pct/article/viewArticle/375/813 A Linguistic and Cultural Comparison of Haitian Creole and Louisiana Creole], postcolonial.org, Accessed March 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also numbers of Creolophones in Natchitoches Parish on [[Cane River]] and sizable communities of Louisiana Creole-speakers in adjacent [[Southeast Texas]] ([[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]]) and the [[Chicago]] area. Louisiana Creole speakers in California reside in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[San Diego County, California|San Diego]]  and  [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]] counties and in Northern California ([[San Francisco Bay Area]],  [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento County]],  [[Plumas County, California|Plumas County]], [[Tehama County, California|Tehama County]], [[Mono County, California|Mono County]], and [[Yuba County, California|Yuba County]].).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/846496076|title=If I could turn my tongue like that : the Creole language of Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana|last=A.|first=Klingler, Thomas|date=2003|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807127795|location=Baton Rouge|oclc=846496076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, there were Creole-speaking communities in Mississippi and Alabama (on [[Mon Louis Island]]), however it is likely that no speakers remain in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Margaret|date=1991|title=The Creole of Mon Louis Island, Alabama, and the Louisiana Connection|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/jpcl.6.1.05mar|journal=Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages|volume=6|pages=73–87|via=|doi=10.1075/jpcl.6.1.05mar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Creole experience in Louisiana is a close cousin to Creole cultures world-wide. The nearest examples are found in the Caribbean: Cuba, Haiti, Guadeloupe and Martinique. The Indian Ocean holds: Réunion, Mauritius, Seychelles and Goa. In South America, the Guianas and Brazil are recognized as Creole countries.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Plantation, Louisiana's Creole Heritage Site, https://www.lauraplantation.com/creole-history/what-is-creole&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Disputed section|date=January 2018}}

Definite articles in Louisiana Creole vary between the ''le'', ''la'' and ''les'' used in standard French (a testament of possible decreolization in some areas) and ''a'' and ''la'' for the singular, and ''yé'' for the plural.{{Dubious|date=November 2017}}  Louisiana Creole exhibits [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) word order.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Personal pronouns &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;===

In theory, Creole places its definite articles after the noun, unlike French. Given Louisiana Creole's complex linguistic relationship with [[Colonial French]] and [[Cajun French]], however, this is often no longer the case. Since there is no system of noun gender, articles only vary on phonetic criteria. The article ''a'' is placed after words ending in a vowel, and ''la'' is placed after words ending in a consonant.{{Dubious|date=November 2017}}

Another aspect of Louisiana Creole which is unlike French is the lack of verb conjugation. Verbs do not vary based on person or number. Verbs vary based on verbal markers (e.g., ''té'' (past tense), ''sé'' (conditional), ''sa'' or "a[alé]" (future)) which are placed between the personal pronouns and conjugated verbs (e.g. ''Mo té kourí ô Villaj'', "I went to Lafayette"). Frequently in the past tense, the verbal marker is omitted and one is left to figure out the time of the event through context.

==Vocabulary==
{{MOS|section|date=November 2015}}{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}

The vocabulary of Louisiana Creole is of primarily of French origin, as French is the language's [[lexifier]]. Some local vocabulary, such as topography, animals, plants are of Amerindian origin. The language has a small number of vocabulary items from west and central African languages (namely Bambara, Wolof, Fon) in folklore and in the religion of [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Valdman, ''Dictionary of Louisiana Creole,''  Indiana University Press, 1998, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this non-French vocabulary is shared with other [[French-based creole languages]] of North America, and Louisiana Creole shares all but a handful of vocabulary with Louisiana French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/973171332|title=New Orleans and the global South : Caribbean, Creolization, carnival|last=Neumann-Holzschuh|first=Ingrid|publisher=Georg-Olms-Verlag AG|others=|year=2016|isbn=3487155044|editor-last=Ette|editor-first=Ottmar|location=Hildesheim|pages=|chapter=Entre la Caraïbe et l'Amérique du Nord: le créole louisianais et son lexique à la lumière de ses contacts linguistiques et culturels|oclc=973171332|editor-last2=Müller|editor-first2=Gesine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media &amp; Citizenship''' Transnational Television Cultures Reshaping Political Identities in the [[European Union]] is a three year (2008–2011) [[research project]] funded by the [[Seventh Framework Programme]] of the [[European Commission]].

This project studies the ways [[transnational media]], in particular [[Arabic language]] television, reshape the political landscapes of [[citizenship]] in the European Union. It provides the first European wide [[empirical research]] on the use of Arabic-language television and its influence on integration in multicultural societies. After collecting data across 7 EU nations ([[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]), focus group studies explore how Arabic speakers themselves construct citizenship in the light of their media use, and their adopted national cultures.

The Media &amp; Citizenship consortium is coordinated by the [[Utrecht University]] and consists of the [[University of Bielefeld]], the [[London School of Economics]], [[Örebro University]] and the [[Paris-Sorbonne University]] (Paris IV).

The '''Turkic Sanctuaries of Merke''' are located in southern [[Kazakhstan]], roughly 37&amp;nbsp;km south of present-day Merke in the [[Jambyl Province]].  At 3000 m high, the sanctuaries in this mountainous region of Kirghizki Alatau number more than 170 over nearly 250&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1131/ Turkic sanctuary of Merke - UNESCO World Heritage Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;  The sites are well-preserved at the moment due to their isolation and relative difficulty of access. Each site may include small [[Stele|stelae]] (one to four), possibly representing the ancestors buried underneath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1131/ Turkic sanctuary of Merke - UNESCO World Heritage Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Heritage Status ==
This site was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on September 24, 1998 in the Mixed (Cultural &amp; Natural) category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1131/ Turkic sanctuary of Merke - UNESCO World Heritage Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Miracle At Philadelphia: The Story of the Constitutional Convention''''' is a work of historical non-fiction, written by [[Catherine Drinker Bowen]] and originally published in 1966. Bowen recounts the [[Philadelphia Convention]], a meeting in 1787 that created the [[United States Constitution]]. Bowen draws much of her information from notes and journals of the Framers, especially [[James Madison]]. It contains vivid description of many founders including [[George Washington]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[James Madison]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[George Mason]], and [[Gouverneur Morris]], important compromises such as the [[Great Compromise]], and controversial issues such as [[slavery]].

[[File:Mark Burrell (left) and Peter Rodulfo (right) Great Yarmouth 2014.jpg|thumb|The artists Mark Burrell and Peter Rodulfo. Great Yarmouth 2014]]
The '''North Sea Magical Realists''' are a collective of artists resident on the [[North Sea]] coast whose art is loosely influenced by the aesthetics of [[Magical Realism]]. Its leading members include the artists [[Peter Rodulfo]] (b. 1958) and [[Mark Burrell]] (b. 1957). &lt;ref&gt; http://trippgallery.co.uk/exhibition/north-sea-magical-realists &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; http://aquariumofvulcan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/mark-burrell-north-sea-magical-realist.html &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://aquariumofvulcan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/as-elephant-laughed-and-norfolk.html &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; http://aquariumofvulcan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/rodulfos-mandala-of-loving-kindness.html &lt;/ref&gt; 

Aware of each other's work for a number of years, Burrell and Rudolfo first met in New York USA, when exhibiting at the New York Expo of 1998.

In 2016 Burrell and Rodulfo elected [[Sir Thomas Browne]] as honorary 'Grand-father' of the movement, and simultaneously painted items found in Browne's [[Musaeum Clausum]] (section ''Rarities in Pictures''); Rodulfo painting item number 3 in the medium of oils on canvas (157 x 143&amp;nbsp;cm) with a title of ''Dr. Browne goes Submarining''; Burrell painting item 12 in the medium of alkyd resins on board (50 x 49&amp;nbsp;cm) with a title of ''Silent Presence''. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/NorthSeaMagicalRealism/ &lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017 the North Sea Magical Realists held their first show at the Tripp Gallery, Amwell Street, London. Rodulfo and Burrell exhibited paintings, sculptures, etchings and included assemblages by group member Guy Richardson (b.1932)&lt;ref&gt; http://trippgallery.co.uk/exhibition/north-sea-magical-realists/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11544">A '''prequel''' is a literary, dramatic, or cinematic work whose story precedes that of a previous work,&lt;ref name=mw/&gt;&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; by focusing on events that occur before the original narrative.&lt;ref name=Silverblatt&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverblatt|first=Art|year=2007|title=Genre Studies in Mass Media: A Handbook|publisher=[[M. E. Sharpe]]|isbn=9780765616708|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=R7ixUTC8EpwC&amp;pg=PA211 211]|quote=Prequels focus on the action that took place ''before'' the original narrative. For instance, in ''Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith'' the audience learns about how Darth Vader originally became a villain. A prequel assumes that the audience is familiar with the original—the audience must rework the narrative so that they can understand how the prequel leads up to the beginning of the original.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prequel is a work that forms part of a [[backstory]] to the preceding work.

All "prequels" are, by definition, essentially [[sequel]]s in that they "expand on a ''previous'' or ''preceding'' work."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sequel merriam-Webster Dictionary, Entry for ''sequel'']&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a 20th-century [[neologism]] that is a [[portmanteau]] of the prefix "pre-" (from [[Latin]] ''prae'', "before") and "sequel".&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite book|year=1993|title=[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]]|edition=10th|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|pages=921, 915, 1068, 246|location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;

Like other sequels, prequels may or may not concern the same plot as the work from which they are derived. Often, they explain the background which led to the events in the original, but sometimes the connections are not as explicit. Sometimes, prequels play on the audience's knowledge of what will happen next, using deliberate references to create [[dramatic irony]].

==History==
Though the word "prequel" is of recent origin, works fitting this concept existed long before. The ''[[Cypria]]'', presupposing hearers' acquaintance with the events of the Homeric epic, confined itself to what preceded the ''[[Iliad]]'', and thus formed a kind of introduction.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' the word "prequel" first appeared in print in 1958 in an article by [[Anthony Boucher]] in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'', used to describe [[James Blish]]'s 1956 story ''[[They Shall Have Stars]],'' which expanded on the story introduced in his earlier 1955 work, ''Earthman Come Home''. The term came into general usage in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite book |contribution=prequel, n. |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |format=online |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=March 2012 |origyear=March 2007 |contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/150546 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Butch and Sundance: The Early Days]]'' (1979) may have introduced the term "prequel" into the mainstream.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/06/26/lester/|last=Burgess|first=Steve|date=1999-06-26|title=Richard Lester: A Hard Day's Life|quote=Lester may also have locked up the dubious distinction of inaugurating the term 'prequel' in 1979 when he directed 'Butch and Sundance: The Early Days.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has since been popularized by the [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy]] (1999-2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deever |first=Chris |title=On prequels and The Prequel |publisher=TruthInStuff |date=28 May 2001 |url=http://www.truthinstuff.com/Cinema/prequel.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040101110428/http://www.truthinstuff.com/Cinema/prequel.html |archivedate=1 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}

==Usage==
Rather than being a concept distinct from that of a ''sequel'', a ''prequel'' still adheres to the general principle of serialization, defined only by its internal chronology and publication order. For example, ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999) is a prequel to ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) but is only a ''predecessor'' rather than a ''prequel'' of ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) because of the release order. Likewise, 1984's ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' is a prequel to 1981's ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark|Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark]],'' in that it is set in 1935, one year before the first film.

===Complications===
Sometimes "prequel" describes followups where it is not always possible to apply a label defined solely in terms of [[intertextuality]].&lt;ref name=Jess-Cooke/&gt; In the case of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', the narrative combines elements of a prequel with those of a more generalized sequel by having two intercut narrative strands, one continuing from the first film ([[the mafia]] family story under the leadership of [[Michael Corleone]]), and one, completely separate, detailing events that precede it (the story of his father [[Vito Corleone]] in his youth). In this sense the film can be regarded as both a "prequel and a sequel" (i.e., both a prior and a continuing story), and is often referred to in this manner.&lt;ref name=Jess-Cooke&gt;{{cite book|last=Jess-Cooke|first=Carolyn|authorlink=Carolyn Jess-Cooke|year=2009|title=Film Sequels: Theory and Practice from Hollywood to Bollywood|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=9780748626038|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sw0mjBBbybUC&amp;pg=PA6 6]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original [[Planet of the Apes|''Planet of the Apes'' series]], even though the latter three films depict world events chronologically prior to those of the first two films, the narrative itself is continuous for the main characters, as three apes from the first two films go back in time. The later installments (''[[Escape from the Planet of the Apes|Escape from...]]'',&lt;ref name=dirks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/sci-fifilms5.html|title=Science Fiction Films Part 5|first=Tim|last=Dirks|publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] Filmsite|quote=A sequel and prequel to the first two films.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Conquest of the Planet of the Apes|Conquest of...]]'',&lt;ref name=britt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/whos-your-caesar-re-watching-conquest-of-the-planet-of-the-apes|title=Who's Your Caesar?

In recent times the term "prequel" has also been applied to [[origin-story]] [[reboot (fiction)|reboots]], such as ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]'', ''[[Batman Begins]]'', and ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''.&lt;ref name=rota&gt;{{cite news |author=Associated Press|authorlink=Associated Press|title=With the documentary ‘Chimpanzee’ opening, a look at 5 prime primate movies|work=The Statesman|url=http://www.statesman.com/business/personal-finance/with-chimpanzee-opening-5-prime-primate-movies-2316295.html|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sutton&gt;{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=Paul|year=2010|chapter=8.

At times, the term has been used to refer to a work that was released, as well as chronologically set, before any other work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/top-5-bollywood-movie-better-than-prequel/1/444747.html|title=5 Bollywood movies which are better then their prequels|website=India Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/regional/singam-3-will-have-connection-with-prequels-director/|title=‘Singam 3’ will have connection with prequels: Director|date=22 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that usage conflicts with the fact that a prequel is a type of sequel.

The 2009 film ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' features characters from the 1960s TV series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', but earlier in their careers. However, the film is set in an alternate timeline caused by a [[Romulan]] captain from the universe of the original series going back in time and interfering with history. Thus, the film has been described as simultaneously a prequel and a reboot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Star Trek 3 to Include Spock and Kirk Reunion With William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/star-trek-3-include-spock-kirk-reunion-william-shatner-leonard-nimoy-1466727 |work=International Business Times |first=Ben |last=Skipper |date=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Race and ethnicity in the United States Census''', defined by the federal [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) and the [[United States Census Bureau]], are [[self-identification]] data items in which residents choose the [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race or races]] with which they most closely identify, and indicate whether or not they are of Hispanic or Latino origin (the only [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|categories for ethnicity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/help/en/race.htm|title=American FactFinder Help: Race|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/help/en/hispanic_or_latino_origin.htm|title=American FactFinder Help: Hispanic or Latino origin|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racial categories represent a social-political construct for the race or races that respondents consider themselves to be and, "generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country."&lt;ref name=Q&amp;A/&gt; OMB defines the concept of race as outlined for the US Census as not "scientific or anthropological" and takes into account "social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry", using "appropriate scientific methodologies" that are not "primarily biological or genetic in reference."&lt;ref name=AAA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaanet.org/gvt/ombdraft.htm |title=A Brief History of the OMB Directive 15 |accessdate=2007-05-18 |publisher=American Anthropological Association |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race categories include both racial and national-origin groups.&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/help/en/ethnic_groups.htm|title=American FactFinder Help: Ethnic Groups|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Race (human classification)|Race]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] are considered separate and distinct identities, with [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] origin asked as a separate question. Thus, in addition to their race or races, all respondents are categorized by membership in one of two ethnic categories, which are "Hispanic or Latino" and "Not Hispanic or Latino". However, the practice of separating "race" and "ethnicity" as different categories has been criticized both by the [[American Anthropological Association]] and members of [[US Commission on Civil Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racial Categorization in the 2010 Census|url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/RC2010Web_Version.pdf|publisher=US Commission of Civil Rights|accessdate=7 December 2012|author=Gerald A.

In 1997, OMB issued a [[Federal Register]] notice regarding revisions to the standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity |publisher=[[Office of Management and Budget]] |date=1997-10-30 |accessdate=2008-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; OMB developed race and ethnic standards in order to provide "consistent data on race and ethnicity throughout the Federal Government. The development of the data standards stem in large measure from new responsibilities to enforce civil rights laws." Among the changes, OMB issued the instruction to "mark one or more races" after noting evidence of increasing numbers of interracial children and wanting to capture the diversity in a measurable way and having received requests by people who wanted to be able to acknowledge their or their children's full ancestry rather than identifying with only one group. Prior to this decision, the Census and other government data collections asked people to report only one race.&lt;ref name=Q&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2001/raceqandas.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010405061504/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2001/raceqandas.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 5, 2001|title=Questions and Answers for Census 2000 Data on Race|date=March 14, 2001|accessdate=2010-04-25|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How data on race and ethnicity are used==
The OMB states, "many federal programs are put into effect based on the race data obtained from the decennial census (i.e., promoting equal employment opportunities; assessing racial disparities in health and environmental risks). Race data are also critical for the basic research behind many policy decisions. States require these data to meet legislative redistricting requirements. The data are needed to monitor compliance with the Voting Rights Act by local jurisdictions".

"Data on ethnic groups are important for putting into effect a number of federal statutes (i.e., enforcing bilingual election rules under the Voting Rights Act; monitoring and enforcing equal employment opportunities under the Civil Rights Act). Data on Ethnic Groups are also needed by local governments to run programs and meet legislative requirements (i.e., identifying segments of the population who may not be receiving medical services under the [[Public Health Act]]; evaluating whether financial institutions are meeting the credit needs of minority populations under the [[Community Reinvestment Act]])."&lt;ref name=fact/&gt;

===18th and 19th centuries===

====1790 Census====
In 1790, first official year of the US Census, these questions were asked, four of which had racial implications:
*Number of free white males aged under 16 years
*Number of free white males aged 16 years and upward
*Number of free white females
*Number of other free people
*Number of [[slavery|slaves]]&lt;ref name=thru&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions|title=Through the Decades | accessdate=2012-01-18 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1800 &amp; 1810 census====
In 1800 and 1810, the age question regarding free white males was more detailed.&lt;ref name=thru /&gt;

====1820 Census====
The 1820 census built on the questions asked in 1810 by asking age questions about slaves. Also the term "colored" entered the census nomenclature. In addition, a question stating "Number of foreigners not naturalized" was included.&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;

====1830 Census====
In the 1830 census, a new question which stated "The number of White persons who were foreigners not naturalized" was included.&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;

====1850 Census====
The 1850 census saw a dramatic shift in the way information about residents was collected. For the first time, free persons were listed individually instead of by head of household. There were two questionnaires: one for free inhabitants and one for slaves.
The question on the free inhabitants schedule about color was a column that was to be left blank if a person was white, marked "B" if a person was black, and marked "M" if a person was [[mulatto]].
Slaves were listed by owner, and classified by gender and age, not individually, and the question about color was a column that was to be marked with a "B" if the slave was black and an "M" if mulatto.&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;

====1870 Census====
For the 1870 census, the color/racial question was expanded to include "C" for Chinese, which was a category that included all east Asians, as well as "I" for American Indians.&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;

====1890 Census====
For 1890, the Census Office changed the design of the population questionnaire. Residents were still listed individually, but a new questionnaire sheet was used for each family. Additionally, this was the first year that the census distinguished among different Asian ethnic groups, such as [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]], due to increased immigration. This census also marked the beginning of the term "race" in the questionnaires.
Enumerators were instructed to write "White," "Black," "[[Mulatto]]," "[[Quadroon]]," "[[Octoroon]]," "Chinese," "Japanese," or "[[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]."&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;

====1900 Census====
During 1900, the "Color or Race" question was slightly modified, removing the term "Mulatto". Also, there was an inclusion of an "Indian Population Schedule" in which "enumerators were instructed to use a special expanded questionnaire for American Indians living on reservations or in family groups off of reservations." This expanded version included the question "Fraction of person's lineage that is white."&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;

===20th century===

====1910 Census====
The 1910 census was similar to that of 1900, but it included a reinsertion of "Mulatto" and a question about the respondent's "mother tongue." "Ot" was also added to signify "other races", with space for a race to be written in. This decade's version of the Indian Population Schedule featured questions asking the individual's proportion of white, black, or American Indian lineage.&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;

====1920 Census====
The 1920 census questionnaire was similar to 1910, but excluded a separate schedule for American Indians. "Hin", "Kor", and "Fil" were also added to the "Color or Race" question, signifying Hindustani (South Asia Indian), Korean, and Filipino, respectively.&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;

====1930 Census====
The biggest change in this year's census was in racial classification. Enumerators were instructed to no longer use the "Mulatto" classification. Instead, they were given special instructions for reporting the race of interracial persons. A person with both white and black ancestry (termed "blood") was to be recorded as "Negro," no matter the fraction of that lineage (the "[[one-drop rule]]"). A person of mixed black and American Indian ancestry was also to be recorded as "Neg" (for "Negro") unless he was considered to be "predominantly" American Indian and accepted as such within the community. A person with both White and American Indian ancestry was to be recorded as an Indian, unless his American Indian ancestry was small, and he was accepted as white within the community. In all situations in which a person had White and some other racial ancestry, he was to be reported as that other race. Persons who had minority interracial ancestry were to be reported as the race of their father.

For the first and only time, "Mexican" was listed as a race. Enumerators were instructed that all persons born in Mexico, or whose parents were born in Mexico, should be listed as Mexicans, and not under any other racial category. But, in prior censuses and in 1940, enumerators were instructed to list Mexican Americans as white, perhaps because some of them were of white background (mainly Spanish), many others mixed white and Native American and some of them Native American.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The Supplemental American Indian questionnaire was back, but in abbreviated form. It featured a question asking if the person was of full or mixed American Indian ancestry.&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;copy of the full 1930 census instructions https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/1930instructions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====1940 Census====
President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] promoted a "good neighbor" policy that sought better relations with Mexico. In 1935, a federal judge ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white, as required by federal law. Mexico protested, and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white. The State Department, the Census Bureau, the Labor Department, and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white. This policy encouraged the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick D. Lukens, ''A Quiet Victory for Latino Rights: FDR and the Controversy over Whiteness'' (University of Arizona Press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1940 census was the first to include separate population and housing questionnaires.&lt;ref name=thru/&gt; The race category of "Mexican" was eliminated in 1940, and the population of Mexican descent was counted with the White population.&lt;ref name=1930sMex&gt;[http://www.1930census.com/us_census_history.php The 1930 Census in Perspective], 1930census.com&lt;/ref&gt;

1940 census data was used for [[Japanese American internment]]. The Census Bureau's role was denied for decades, but was finally proven in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Confirmed: The U.S. Census Bureau Gave Up Names of Japanese-Americans in WW II|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=confirmed-the-us-census-b&amp;sc=I100322|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829181345/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=confirmed-the-us-census-b&amp;sc=I100322|archive-date=August 29, 2013|dead-url=yes|publisher=Scientific American|author=JR Minkel|date=March 30, 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-30-census-role_N.htm|title=Papers show Census role in WWII camps|work=USA Today|author=Haya El Nasser|date=March 30, 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1950 Census====
The 1950 Census questionnaire removed the word "color" from the racial question, and also removed Hindu and Korean from the race choices.&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;

====1960 Census====
The 1960 Census re-added the word "color" to the racial question, and changed "Indian" to "American Indian", as well as added Hawaiian, Part-Hawaiian, Aleut, and Eskimo. The Other (print out race) option was removed.&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;

====1970 Census====
This year's census included "Negro or Black", re-added Korean and the Other race option. East Indians (the term used at that time for people whose ancestry is from the [[Indian subcontinent]]) were counted as White. There was a questionnaire that was asked of only a sample of respondents. These questions were as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# &lt;li value="13"&gt;a. Where was this person born?&lt;br /&gt;b. Is this person's origin or descent...&lt;/li&gt;
#* [[Mexican people|Mexican]]
#* [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]]
#* [[Cubans|Cuban]]
#* Central or [[South America]]n
#* Other [[Spanish people|Spanish]]
#* None of These
# What country was the person's father born in?
# What country was the person's mother born in?
# a. For persons born in a foreign country- Is the person naturalized?&lt;br /&gt;b. When did the person come to the United States to stay?
# What [[language]], other than [[English language|English]], was spoken in the person's home as a child?
#*[[Spanish language|Spanish]]
#*[[French language|French]]
#*[[Italian language|Italian]]
#*[[German language|German]]
#*Other
#*None, only English&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====1980 Census====
This year added several options to the race question, including Vietnamese, Indian (East), Guamanian, Samoan, and re-added Aleut. Again, the term "color" was removed from the racial question, and the following questions were asked of a sample of respondents:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# &lt;li value="11"&gt;In what state or foreign country was the person born?&lt;/li&gt;
# If this person was born in a foreign country...&lt;br /&gt;a. Is this person a naturalized citizen of the United States?&lt;br /&gt;b. When did this person come to the United States to stay?
# a. Does this person speak a language other than English at home?&lt;br /&gt;b. If yes, what is this language?&lt;br /&gt;c. If yes, how well does this person speak English?
# What is this person's ancestry?&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====1990 Census====
The racial categories in this year are as they appear in the 2000 and 2010 Census. The following questions were asked of a sample of respondents for the 1990 Census:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# &lt;li value="8"&gt;In what U.S. State or foreign country was this person born?&lt;/li&gt;
# Is this person a citizen of the United States?
# If this person was not born in the United States, when did this person come to the United States to stay?&lt;ref name=thru/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The 1990 Census was not designed to capture multiple racial responses, and when individuals marked the Other race option and provided a multiple write in, the response was assigned according to the race written first. "For example, a write in of "Black-White" was assigned a code of Black, a write in of "White-Black" was assigned a code of White."&lt;ref name=Q&amp;A/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''In the [[United States]], census data indicate that the number of children in interracial families grew from less than one half million in 1970 to about two million in 1990. In 1990, for interracial families with one [[white American]] partner, the other parent...was [[Asian American]] for 45 percent...''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/census_2000/datasets/CQS/B.3.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031020153728/http://www2.census.gov/census_2000/datasets/CQS/B.3.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-10-20|title=US Census Bureau, 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====2000 Census====
Race was asked differently in the [[United States Census, 2000|Census 2000]] in several other ways than previously. Most significantly, respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate racial identities. Data show that nearly seven million Americans identified as members of two or more races. Because of these changes, the Census 2000 data on race are not directly comparable with data from the [[United States Census, 1990|1990 census]] or earlier censuses. Use of caution is therefore recommended when interpreting changes in the racial composition of the US population over time.

The following definitions apply to the 2000 census only.&lt;ref name=cen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68178.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831085310/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68178.htm |archivedate=2009-08-31|work=US Census Bureau |title=2000 Census of Population, Public Law 94-171 Redistricting Data File: Race |accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[federal government of the United States]] has mandated that "in data collection and presentation, federal agencies are required to use a minimum of two ethnicities: "Hispanic or Latino" and "Not Hispanic or Latino".&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: Census 2000 Brief |work=US Census Bureau |format=PDF |date=March 2001 |author1=Grieco, Elizabeth M. |author2=Cassidy, Rachel C. |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/cenbr01-1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Census Bureau defines "Hispanic or Latino" as "a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race."&lt;ref name=overview /&gt; For discussion of the meaning and scope of the Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, see the [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] and [[Racial and ethnic demographics of the United States]] articles.

Use of the word "ethnicity" for Hispanics only is considerably more restricted than its conventional meaning, which covers other distinctions, some of which are covered by the "race" and [[Ancestry (United States Census)|"ancestry"]] questions. The distinct questions accommodate the possibility of Hispanic and Latino Americans' also declaring various racial identities (see also [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans]], [[Asian Latin American#Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans|Asian Latinos]], and [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans]]).

In the [[United States Census 2000|2000 Census]], 12.5% of the US population reported "Hispanic or Latino" ethnicity and 87.5% reported "Not-Hispanic or Latino" ethnicity.&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt;

===21st century===

====2010 Census====
The [[United States Census, 2010|2010 US Census]] included changes designed to more clearly distinguish Hispanic ethnicity as not being a race. That included adding the sentence: "For this census, Hispanic origins are not races."&lt;!--page 13--&gt;&lt;ref name=2010Waite /&gt;&lt;ref name=cenform/&gt; Additionally, the Hispanic terms were modified from "Hispanic or Latino" to "Hispanic, Latino or [[Spanish people|Spanish]] origin".&lt;!--page 12--&gt;&lt;ref name=2010Waite&gt;Waite, Preston.

In the [[United States Census 2000|2000 Census]], respondents were tallied in each of the race groups they reported. Consequently, the total of each racial category exceeds the total population because some people reported more than one race.&lt;ref name=Q&amp;A/&gt;

According to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University, Northridge, by some calculations in the 2000 Census the largest part white biracial population is white/Native American and Alaskan Native, at 7,015,017, followed by white/black at 737,492, then white/Asian at 727,197, and finally white/Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander at 125,628.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csupomona.edu/~mreibel/2000_Census_Files/Allen-Turner.doc Bridging 1990 and 2000 census race data: Fractional assignment of multiracial populations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002234040/http://www.csupomona.edu/~mreibel/2000_Census_Files/Allen-Turner.doc |date=2008-10-02 }}, James P. Allen and Eugene Turner, Department of Geography, California State University, Northridge, Northridge, CA 91330-8249&lt;/ref&gt;

The Census Bureau implemented a Census Quality Survey, gathering data from about 50,000 households to assess the reporting of race and Hispanic origin in the [[United States Census 2000|2000 Census]] with the purpose of creating a way to make comparisons between the [[United States Census 2000|2000 Census]] with previous Census racial data.&lt;ref name=Q&amp;A/&gt;

In September 1997, during the process of revision of racial categories previously declared by OMB directive no. 15, the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) recommended that OMB combine the "race" and "ethnicity" categories into one question to appear as "race/ethnicity" for the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 US Census]]. The Interagency Committee agreed, stating that "race" and "ethnicity" were not sufficiently defined and "that many respondents conceptualize 'race' and 'ethnicity' as one in the same {{sic}} underscor[ing] the need to consolidate these terms into one category, using a term that is more meaningful to the American people."&lt;ref name=AAA /&gt;

The AAA also stated,
{{quote|The American Anthropological Association recommends the elimination of the term "race" from OMB Directive 15 during the planning for the 2010 Census. During the past 50 years, "race" has been scientifically proven to not be a real, natural phenomenon. More specific, social categories such as "ethnicity" or "ethnic group" are more salient for scientific purposes and have fewer of the negative, racist connotations for which the concept of race was developed.

Yet the concept of race has become thoroughly—and perniciously—woven into the cultural and political fabric of the United States. It has become an essential element of both individual identity and government policy. Because so much harm has been based on "racial" distinctions over the years, correctives for such harm must also acknowledge the impact of "racial" consciousness among the U.S. populace, regardless of the fact that "race" has no scientific justification in human biology. Eventually, however, these classifications must be transcended and replaced by more non-racist and accurate ways of representing the diversity of the U.S. population.&lt;ref name=AAA/&gt;}}

The recommendations of the AAA were not adopted by the Census Bureau for the 2000 or the 2010 Censuses.

'''Rag painting''' or '''ragging''' is a form of [[faux painting]] using paint thinned out with [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] and old rags to create a lively texture on walls and other surfaces.  [[Image:sch ewf 5.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Example of the ragging design with a stencil]]

Ragging can be done as a negative or positive technique.  The former involves rolling glaze over the entire surface, and removing it with clean rags to reveal the underlying paint color in a pleasing textural pattern.  The latter is accomplished by applying glaze directly to the wall with a rag, and creates a similar pattern.  Ragging is a very adaptable finish that can be used in a variety of areas, creating the illusion of an old world texture, but on a flat surface that can be easily painted over.

Ragging can be done in a variety of patterns, including rag rolling, in which the rags are twisted together and then rolled over a wet glazed surface creating the illusion of fabrics such a velvet or silk.  Ragging is also often used as a pattern underneath stenciling.

[[File:De Landa alphabet.jpg|thumb|[[De Landa alphabet]]]]
'''''Relación de las cosas de Yucatán''''' was written by [[Diego de Landa]] around 1566, shortly after his return from [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] to [[Spain]]. In it, de Landa catalogues [[Mayan languages|Mayan words and phrases]] as well as a small number of [[Maya script|Mayan hieroglyphs]]. The hieroglyphs, sometimes referred to as the [[de Landa alphabet]], proved vital to modern attempts to decipher the script.&lt;ref&gt;[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]], [[Jared Diamond]], p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also includes documentation of [[Maya religion]] and the [[Mayan people]]s' culture in general. It was written with the help of local [[Maya civilization|Maya]] princes. It contains, at the end of a long list of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words with Maya translations, a Maya phrase, famously found to mean "I do not want to." The original manuscript has been lost, but many copies still survive.

The first published edition was produced by Charles Etienne Brasseur de Boubourg in 1864 under the title ''Relation des choses de Yucatan de Diego de Landa. Texte espagnol et traduction française en regard comprenant les signes du calendrier et de l’alphabet hiéroglyphique de la langue maya accompagné de documents divers historiques et chronologiques, avec un grammaire et un vocabulaire abrégés français-maya précédés d’un Essai sur les sources de l’histoire primitive du Mexique et de l’Amérique centrale, Etc., d’après les monuments égyptiens et de l’histoire primitive de l’Égypte d’après les monuments américains''. Colonialist scholar John Woodruff has suggested that one passage in particular stands out as the principal basis for the belief that late post-classic Maya had numerous written books:

::"These people also used special characters or letters with which they recorded in their books their histories and knowledge, as well as figures, and particular signs in those figures explained it all, and lent it meaning and understanding. We found a great number of books containing such letters, and as they did not contain an iota in which there was not superstition and falsehoods of the devil, we burned them all, which dismayed and distressed them greatly."&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Woodruff. The original Spanish reads: "Usavan tambien esta gente de ciertos carateres o letras con las quales escrivian en sus libros sus cosas antiguas, y sus sciencias, y con ellas, y figuras, y algunas señales en las figuras entendian sus cosas, y las davan a entender y enseñavan. Hallamosles grande numero de libros destas sus letras, y porque no tenian cosa en que no uviesse supersticion y falsedades del demonio se les quemamos todos, lo qual a maravilla sentian, y les dava pena."&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently-available English translations include [[William E. Gates]]'s 1937 translation, has been published by multiple publishing houses, under the title ''Yucatan Before and After the Conquest: The Maya''. [[Alfred Tozzer]] of [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] has also published a translation of the work from the [[Cambridge University Press]] in 1941.

'''Richa Nagar''' (born 1968, in [[Lucknow]], India) is a scholar, creative writer, educator, and theatre-worker who is [http://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/nagar Professor of the College in the College of Liberal Arts] at the [[University of Minnesota]].  Nagar's creative and scholarly work makes multi-lingual and multi-genre contributions to [[transnational feminism]], [[social geography]], critical [[development studies]], and [[critical ethnography]]. Her research has encompassed a range of topics including: politics of space, identity and community among communities of [[South Asian]] origin in [[Tanzania]]; questions of [[empowerment]] in relation to grass-roots struggles in the global South, principally with the [https://sangtin.org/home/ Sangtin Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan] (SKMS) in [[Sitapur District]], India; the politics of language and social fracturing in the context of development and neo-liberal globalization; and creative praxis that uses collaboration, co-authorship, and translation to blur the borders between academic, activist, and artistic labor. She has held residential fellowships at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS) at Stanford in 2005-2006, at the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Advanced Study (JNIAS) at New Delhi in 2011-2012, and at the Centre for Humanities Research at the University of the Western Cape in 2013.

== Work on the Politics of Place and Identity among 'Asians' in Tanzania ==
Richa Nagar's historical, geographical, and feminist exploration of the politics of place, identity, and community among 'Asians' in Tanzania is based on a "large number of life histories as well as participant observation" among Hindus, Khoja Shia Ithna Asheris, Goans and Sikhs, chiefly in the city of Dar es Salaam.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Mary Jo Maynes, Jennifer L.

In 2004, Nagar published with eight rural women activists or Sangtins, the Hindi book, ''Sangtin Yatra''&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/56686|title=Sangtin Yatra: Saat Zindgiyon Mein Lipta Nari Vimarsh|first1=|last1=Anupamlata|first2=|last2=Ramsheela|first3=Ansari,|last3=Reshma|first4=Bajpayee,|last4=Vibha|first5=|last5=Shashibala|first6=Vaish,|last6=Shashi|first7=|last7=Surbala|first8=Singh,|last8=Richa|first9=Nagar,|last9=Richa|date=22 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to a "journey of solidarity, reciprocity, and enduring friendship."&lt;ref&gt;Salma Ismail, 2009, Review, Feminist Africa, Vol 13, p. 133-136 http://agi.ac.za/sites/agi.ac.za/files/fa13_review_ismail.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The eight activists—Anupamlata, Ramsheela, Reshma Ansari, Richa Singh, Shashibala, Shashi Vaish, Surbala, and Vibha Bajpayee—collaborated with Richa Nagar to explore questions of power, location, and difference in their own lives through personal storytelling, while also engaging with issues of inequity and discrimination in NGOs that seek to empower poor rural women in the global south.&lt;ref&gt;Salma Ismail, 2009, Review, Feminist Africa, Vol 13, p. 133-136.

Geraldine Pratt; Rupal Oza, Gillian Hart, Matthew Sparke, Sharad Chari, Social &amp; Cultural Geography, 2008, 9: 2: 213-226.&lt;/ref&gt;  This discussion of NGOs triggered a backlash against the authors, which is examined in the English version of the book, ''Playing with Fire: Feminist Thought and Activism Through Seven Lives in India'' (2006). Playing with Fire "challenges academic protocol and activist verities alike" and "grapples with creative solutions, such as upending hierarchies of skill and knowledge in organizations, as well as means to fight organizational dependency on donors...Every chapter makes for fascinating reading as the women emerge in their complexity, in their specificity, and in their international context that still includes outside donors driven by their own interests."&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Armstrong, NWSA Journal, 2008, p. 230 https://muse.jhu.edu/article/237382/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The book "asks us to think in radically new ways about responsibility, access, research, agency, authorship, subjects, and audience. It contributes to the vibrant discourse on the politics of research particularly between the 'north' and 'south' [and] pushes at the boundaries of this discourse as it demonstrates different ways of engaging in collaborative work that challenges the separation between 'the academy' and 'political organizing'."&lt;ref&gt;Rupal Oza, "Challenging the Victim-Recsuer Framework in Playing with Fire," Social and Cultural Geography, 2008, 9: 2: 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also https://www.academia.edu/3089357/Richa_Nagar_is_Playing_with_Fire_.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The debates triggered by ''Sangtin Yatra'' and ''Playing with Fire'' helped to build Sangtin Kisaan Mazdoor Sangathan or the Sangtin Farmers and Laborers Organization (SKMS) in the Mishrikh and Pisawan blocks of Sitapur District of Uttar Pradesh.. Nagar's book with Richa Singh in Hindi, ''Ek Aur Neemsaar: Sangtin Atmamanthan Aur Andolan'' (2012) tells the story of the birth and growth of SKMS. ''Playing with Fire'' and ''Sangtin Yatra'' have been translated into Turkish as ''Ateşle Oynamak: Hindistan'da Yedi Yaşam Üzerinden Feminist Düşünce ve Eylem'' (Ayizi Kitap, 2011) and into Marathi as ''Ageeshee Khelataana: Saat Stree Karyakartancha Sahpravaas'' (Manovikas Prakashan, 2015).

In ''Muddying the Waters: Coauthoring Feminisms Across Scholarship and Activism'' (2014), which received Gloria Anzaldua Book Prize's Honorable Mention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwsa.org/content.asp?contentid=72|title=NWSA|website=www.nwsa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richa Nagar examines coauthorship as a mode of sharing authority and addresses translation as ethical responsibility. The book "emerges out of the difficulties and (im)possibilities encountered in the creation of politically meaningful scholarship that inevitably crosses multiple borders. Those between academia and social movements, academic and nonacademic writing, or geographical and linguistic borders...Nagar's work is a call for politically engaged and ethical research that takes matters of epistemic violence seriously. For the author, such research cannot shy away from the tensions, risks and challenges involved in the building of solidarities and alliances between researchers and the researched 'on the ground.' These 'situated solidarities' are achievable when activists and scholars speak with each other to become 'radically vulnerable' through trust, affect and critical reflexivity without losing sight of their institutional, material and geopolitical positions.".&lt;ref&gt;Desirée Poets, 2016, Book Review, Journal of Narrative Politics, 2:2:176.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Nagar also introduces the concept of 'radical vulnerability' as a critical mode of collectivity in politically-engaged alliance-work—an idea that she and her critics have continued to explore further.&lt;ref&gt;Richa Nagar with Özlem Aslan, Nadia Z.

'''''Saint Luke''''' is a 2.73 m high bronze statue of [[Luke the Evangelist]] by [[Giambologna]], commissioned by the Arte dei Giudici e Notai and completed in 1597-1602. One of a cycle of fourteen commissioned by the guilds of [[Florence]] for the external niches of [[Orsanmichele]], it is now in the [[Museo di Orsanmichele]], although a replica fills its original niche.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21145">[[File:1711 Leipziger und Frankfurter Messkatalog, Osterausgabe.png|thumb|Title page of the German easter 1711 term catalogue]]A '''Term Catalogue''', German Messkatalog, is a [[serial (literature)|serial]] publication compiled to inform customers—most importantly book traders from other cities—of the book production as available on the [[book fair]]s. The first such catalogue was issued by Georg Willer in Augsburg in 1564. Several projects followed the model including the series of English Term Catalogues issued by [[John Starkey (publisher)|John Starkey]] and [[Robert Clavell]] under the title ''Mercurius Librarius, or, a catalogue of books'' from 1668 to 1711.&lt;ref&gt;''The Term Catalogues, 1668-1709, With a Number for Easter Term, 1711 A.D. A Contemporary Bibliography of English Literature in the Reigns of Charles II, James II, William and Mary, and Anne.'' Ed. by Edward Arber, vols. 1-3. London: Edward Arber, 1903/ 1905/ 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; "Term" referred to the dates of the fairs that would be held as platforms of the trade. 

The catalogues are a valuable source to researchers today, because they often give dates of the publication processes and information about working titles that were eventually dropped. The segmentation is of interest for its contemporary perspective on the market: a perspective modern literary histories no longer share.

The book trade of the German-speaking territories was for more than a century the model of all further European developments. The technological achievement of the printing press spread in Germany without the focus on a capital. Germany had cultural centre but a network of cities and territories in different affiliations. A fragmented decentralised geographical space had to be provided with books. Relatively small towns of 20.000 to 40.000 inhabitants created as early as the 1470s and 1480s the basic network of the new trade. Central fairs in [[Nördlingen]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Leipzig]] offered publishers from all over Germany, Austria and Switzerland in the course of the 16th century the option to change books they had published and thus to widen the scope of titles they could sell in their respective shops at home.

The first Term Catalogue published by [[Georg Willer]] in Augsburg in 1564 was supposed to inform his customers in Augsburg about books he had brought home from the last Frankfurt fair. Within the next two years his catalogue became an interesting platform Frankfurt traders would use to observe the market. Willer arranged to have his catalogue printed in Frankfurt where it soon turned from a retrospective into a prospective medium, into a catalogue issued to list all the books that would be offered on the upcoming fair.

His first catalogue showed a strong Latin production. Almost 73% percent of the titles he listed were published in the language of erudition. Most of the books fell into the theology sections. The four university faculties theology, law, medicine and - embracing all other subjects - philosophy set the catalogue's basic structure. Literature in the modern sense had no category of its own.

Willer's project attracted competitors, three of whom gained the power to challenge his project at the turn into the 17th century: An independent catholic platform appeared first in Mainz and then in Frankfurt. The city of Frankfurt began to promote a "privileged" imperial catalogue trying to use the catalogues as a platform of censorship. The 1590 saw, thirdly, the arrival of a new catalogue designed to serve the Frankfurt and Leipzig book fairs - published from 1594 to 1860 in Leipzig.

The Leipzig fairs won the competition in the course of the 17th century. The unified catalogue issued in Leipzig became the central platform of information about books published in the course of this competition.

== English Term Catalogues, 1668 to 1711 ==
Catalogues had their own history on the English market long before the series initiated by John Starkey in 1668.&lt;ref&gt;Growoll, ''A. Three centuries of English book trade bibliography''. New York, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's catalogues had served as a model of a series of continental catalogues published by [[John Bill]] between 1617 and 1628. Bill's catalogues appeared twice a year as a digest of the Frankfurt Messkatalog. Between 1622 and 1626 it included supplements designed to add the English production.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature'' (Cambridge, 1907–21), Volume IV. Prose and Poetry: Sir Thomas North to Michael Drayton, Chapter XVIII. The Book-Trade, 1557–1625, § 26. Early Catalogues. [http://www3.bartleby.com/214/1826.html Bartleby]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The project of an independent conclusive English catalogue began, however, only in 1668 with Starkey's catalogues soon co-edited and then taken over by Robert Clavell. Clavell died on 8 August 1711. His death seems to have terminated the series. The publication had already become unstable in 1708 and 1709. A new catalogue appeared in 1711 under Clavell's mentorship after a gap of more than a year but it remained without a successor. 

The usual rhythm of editions yielded four catalogues per year with issues sold at:
* [[Hilary term|Hillary]] (February)
* [[Easter]] (May)
* [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]] (June or July)
* [[Michaelmas]] (November or December)
The entire collection consists today of 161 catalogues. Some years have not reached the full number of four catalogues. The last catalogues printed in 1708 and 1709 were double editions covering two terms. 1670 saw two rival editions for both Easter and Trinity to mend a perceived deficiency in the official Starkey and Clavell catalogues. London's booksellers complained that their project had focused on publications that sold for more than a [[shilling (British coin)|shilling]], and that it lacked diligence. The complaint reveals that Starkey and Clavell were paid for each title they listed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Publishers of ''Mercurius Librarius,'' by their unreasonable demands for inserting the titles of Books; and also their imperfect Collecting; omitting many; and refusing all under 1sh[illing] [in] Price; hath occasioned the Printing of this Catalogue: wherein those defects are rectified.
&lt;center&gt;Collected by, and printed for, the Booksellers of ''London''.&lt;ref&gt;Easter Catalogue No.1, in ''The Term Catalogues, 1668-1709, With a Number for Easter Term, 1711 A.D.'' Ed. by Edward Arber, vols. 1. London: 1903, p.I.41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A comparison of the numbers of titles listed in the late 17th and early 18th century term catalogues and numbers the [[English Short Title Catalogue]] provides justification for these complaints.

The 161 catalogues printed between 1668 and 1711 show an increase in the number of titles. The average catalogue listed 109 books under 10 headings. Some catalogues had up to 13 headings; the minimum was six in the small catalogue that appeared for Hillary 1708. The first catalogues had begun with 40 to 50 titles; later catalogues reached 150 to 200 titles. The Easter catalogue of 1689 listed the exceptional number of 293 books.

All catalogues opened with a Divinity section and closed with a section of books reprinted. Most of the catalogues offered additional advertisements at the end to announce ongoing projects looking for subscribers and sponsors. The sequence of categories in between varied. History was most often the second heading, Miscellanies usually the one before the Reprinted section. Other prominent headings were Physick (medicine), Mathematicks (comprising Architecture and Navigation in several of the catalogues), Poetry and Plays, Musick, Navigation, Globes, Maps, Cards, Charts, Plates (in the sense of illustrations), Law, Libri Latini (&amp; François), Headings such as Architecture, Heraldry and Astrology remained rare.

None of the catalogues offered a unified section for fiction, or for literature in the modern sense. Novels were customarily listed among the "Histories"—the majority of which were non-fictional—and sometimes as "[[Miscellanies]]". The category "Poetry and Plays" was reserved for verse and stage plays.

A comparison with modern [[English Short Title Catalogue|ESTC]] data proves that the ''Term Catalogues'' remained highly selective. The ESTC lists between more than 13,000 and almost 23,000 titles for the individual decades. The ''Term Catalogue'' numbers range at 20%-30% of that. Catalogues of the 1690s had the greatest average numbers of titles, but ESTC data imply that the 1690s actually saw a slight drop in total title numbers. The distortions are partly the result of the project's instability in 1708 and 1709. They reflect, in part, the continuous neglect of ephemeral publications such as short political pamphlets.   

The series ended in 1708 and 1709 with double editions. The remaining catalogue for Easter 1711 began with a new number 1 issue, and remains remarkable with its attempt to establish a new structure. The long category of reprinted books was split and brought under the respective headings of the new major categories: 1)&amp;nbsp;Divinity, 2)&amp;nbsp;History &amp; Politicks, 3)&amp;nbsp;Mathematical Sciences, 4)&amp;nbsp;Physick &amp; Natural Philosophy, 5)&amp;nbsp;Philology, and 6)&amp;nbsp;Poetry. The new arrangement confirmed the position of the two categories of religious and political publications. "History and Politikcs" stresses the interest in ongoing—religio-political—debates. 1711 is still marked by the [[Henry Sacheverell|Sacheverell]] affair.&lt;ref&gt;Data again retrieved from Edward Arber's edition vol. 3, Catalogue for Easter 1711.

'''''The Analysis of Beauty''''' is a book written by the 18th-century artist and writer [[William Hogarth]], published in 1753, which describes Hogarth's theories of visual beauty and grace in a manner accessible to the common man of his day.

==The "Line of Beauty"==

Prominent among Hogarth's ideas of beauty was the theory of the [[Line of Beauty]]; an S-shaped (serpentine) curved line  that excited the attention of the viewer and evoked liveliness and movement. ''The Analysis of Beauty'' formed the intellectual centrepiece of what the historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] described as Hogarth's "grim campaign against fashionable taste",{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} which Hogarth himself described as his "War with the Connoisseurs".{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Six principles==

In ''The Analysis of Beauty'' Hogarth implements six principles that independently affect beauty. Although he concurs that those principles have an effect, he is not determinate on their specific influence. The first principle of beauty Hogarth describes is '''fitness''', which is not in itself a source of beauty, but can be described as a material cause of it. Though the account of fitness on the total beauty of an object is only moderate, it is a necessary cause. Fitness does not necessarily imply purpose. However, improperly implied forms cannot be the source of beauty. It is in this that the necessity of fitness must be seen: if not accounted for, a form cannot readily be assumed beautiful.

The second major principle of beauty is '''variety'''. It is the source of beauty, which Hogarth shows us by the contrary notion of "sameness": "sameness", a lack of variety, offends the senses. "The ear is as much offended with one even continued note, as the eye is with being fix'd to a point, or to the view of a dead wall."&lt;ref&gt;Hogarth, William, ''The Analysis of Beauty'', Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, our senses find relief in discovering a certain amount of "sameness" within a varietal experience.

The third notion of '''regularity''' is understood as a form of "composed variety": it only pleases us when it is suggestive to fitness. Similar to this notion in effect is '''simplicity''', which enhances the pleasure of variety in that it pleases the eye. The variety which causes a beautiful experience should, so to speak, be tempered by simplicity. On the other hand: simplicity without variety at best does only not displease.

'''Intricacy''' is a strange principle in that it does not directly follow from the formal behaviour of a beautiful object. Hogarth means by this the habit which causes us to end up in the whirling game of pursuit, when bit by bit discovering the beauty of an object. Intricacy arises from the love of this pursuit. Every difficulty in understanding or grasping the object enhances the pleasure of overcoming it, to continue the pursuit. There is a direct connection here to the [[Line of Beauty]] Hogarth dictates, along which every image is built up. Though the movement of our eye is discrete in itself, the movement of our "Mind's eye" follows a duplicate course of the line, a principal ray of light moving along with the line of sight. The continuous movement of our "Mind's eye" triggers the notion of intricacy.

'''Quantity''', finally, is associated with the notion of the [[sublime (literary)|sublime]], which, when Hogarth's book appeared, was not yet entirely distinguished from the apprehension of beauty. Hogarth thus does not speak of sublimity, but of '''greatness'''. He recognises a great quantity to have an aesthetic effect on the beholder without the necessity of a varietal or fitting form. This should not be exaggerated, as that might lead to absurdities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15576">'''''The Meaning of the City''''' is a theological essay by [[Jacques Ellul]] which recounts the story of the [[city]] in the [[Bible]] and seeks to explain the city's biblical significance.

Ellul wrote the book in 1951; it was published in English translation in 1970, and then in French in 1975 as ''Sans feu ni lieu : Signification biblique de la Grande Ville''.

== Synopsis ==
Where is the city's foundation? All [[mythology|mythologies]] speak of an [[Garden of Eden|original garden]], returning to which is man's only desire. The city is the world of man: his creation (made in his image) and his pride because it reflects his culture and his civilization. It is also a place of absurdity, of chaos, and of man's power over Nature and man, a place of [[slavery]] par excellence. Ellul recounts, through the course of the Bible, the [[History of the city|city's origins]]. God places man in a garden because this is his natural place, the place to which he is best adapted. But man wished to separate from God and determine his own destiny. All mythologies herald man's return to nature, a return to the original state. Inversely, the Bible anticipates a perfect city, the [[New Jerusalem]]. "This shows that, out of love, God revises his own plans, taking into account the history of men, including their maddest revolts."&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Rognon, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jacques-ellul-une-pensee-en-dialogue/oclc/180983332&amp;referer=brief_results  ''Jacques Ellul : Une pensée en dialogue''], éd. Labor et Fides, 2007, p.86 [http://www.jacques-ellul.org/influences/la-bible]. "Cela signifie que, par amour, Dieu révise ses propres desseins, pour tenir compte de l'histoire des hommes, y compris de leurs plus folles révoltes."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], Ellul brings to life the rhythm of the city and unmasks the illusions thence attached, navigating within the Christian dialectic between the [[fall of man]] and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] in order to give meaning to the present situation of people, who depend on the big city for everything they do.

== Exegesis ==
Ellul gives an [[exegesis]] of the city in the Bible. This is not a formalist or structuralist exegesis, but a traditional exegesis, which is to say it seeks to present the text as it appears today and in its entirety. This means that the author, here, seeks within the Bible all passages which relate to the city, as the basis for a biblical definition of this place. If the author "hears" the more sophisticated meanings given by his contemporaries, he nevertheless considers that one "cannot honestly interpret a text outside its content and the meaning which it gives itself". He therefore refuses to divide the text into independent fragments, instead taking them in their entirely; he considers the text to be essentially [[dialectical]], implying that its meaning arises within an ensemble of contradictory statements. So doing, Ellul does not seek to explain why the Bible says what it says on the subject of cities, but to show what it says.

== Critique of the city ==
It is within the framework of his critique of technique (see ''[[The Technological Society]]'') that Ellul approaches the city. In effect, according to him, the city is the place where technique becomes [[system]], preventing man from living in freedom. And according to Ellul, this freedom arises in work within proximity to God, and later in the perfect example of [[Jesus Christ]]. Thus, "if one follows Ellul, humanity's freedom of choice seems singularly limited: return to the path of the Christian God or accept the dissolution of humanity. Strictly speaking this conception of liberty is a negation of autonomy, is a [[heteronomy]]. Facing this dilemma to which Ellul condemns us, how can we raise a challenge, how can we find a truly autonomous liberty, which is to say find its true characteristics and true limits?".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Jézéquel, ''Jacques Ellul ou l’impasse de la technique'', Revue du Mauss, 2010. "si l’on suit Ellul, la liberté de choix de l’humanité semble singulièrement restreinte : retrouver le chemin du Dieu chrétien ou se résigner à la disparition de l’humanité. Stricto sensu cette conception de la liberté est une négation de l’autonomie, c’est une hétéronomie. Face au dilemme auquel nous condamne Ellul, comment relever le défi, comment retrouver une liberté véritablement autonome, c’est-à-dire trouvant en elle-même ses propres déterminations et ses propres limites ?"&lt;/ref&gt; This remark, published in the ''[[Revue du MAUSS]]'', critiques Ellul's theistic thrust, but also shows the extent to which man wants to live without God, considering that true liberty cannot exist in relation to a creator.

The city is precisely the place created by man. It is the affirmation of man taking his life into his own hands, independently of God; it is the expression of man's rebellion against God. God has placed man at the garden, a place adapted to him. But man refuses the life for which God has destined him, which is unsettled, and men have gathered and organized themselves in order to depend no longer on nature. This political project (see Ellul 1965, ''L'Illusion politique''), the management of the metropolis, underlies the city: security, survival, commerce, collective living... But this city, created to strengthen human solidarity and protect man against natural aggressions, becomes the place to isolation and insecurity. "Divine or celestial, the city reflects with the space of European culture a religious ideal of 'collective life', on which converge all the major issues of future society. The eater of men and the producer of social regulations, of power conflicts and [[culture shock]]s."&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Dumons et Bernard Hours, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/ville-et-religion-en-europe-du-xvie-au-xxe-siecle-la-cite-reenchantee/oclc/690471282&amp;referer=brief_results  ''Ville et religion en Europe du XVIe au XXe siècle - La cité réenchantée''], la pierre et l'écrit, 2010, p.10). "Divine ou céleste, la cité renvoie dans l’espace culturel européen à l’image d’un idéal religieux du « vivre ensemble » où convergent tous les enjeux majeurs de la société future. Mangeuse d’hommes et productrice de nouvelles économies, la ville s’apparente à un espace où s’opèrent toutes sortes de mobilités démographiques, de régulations sociales, de conflits de pouvoir et de chocs culturels"&lt;/ref&gt; The history of cities is the history of religions cross and interlocking, and of the Christian experience of this relationship, principally in relation to the urban conquest through which religion expanded itself. Since the 1960s, thinkers have raised the question of the "Secular City",&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Cox, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/cite-seculiere-essai-theologique-sur-la-secularisation-et-lurbanisation/oclc/77172490&amp;referer=brief_results ''La Cité séculière. Essai théologique sur la sécularisation et l’urbanisation''], Paris, Casterman, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Comblin, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/theologie-de-la-ville/oclc/299893060&amp;referer=brief_results ''Théologie de la ville''], Paris, Éditions Universitaires, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/sans-feu-ni-lieu-signification-biblique-de-la-grande-ville/oclc/2138310&amp;referer=brief_results Jacques Ellul, ''Sans feu, ni lieu''], Paris, Gallimard, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and the city has become a "theological issue".&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Dumons et Bernard Hours, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/ville-et-religion-en-europe-du-xvie-au-xxe-siecle-la-cite-reenchantee/oclc/690471282&amp;referer=brief_results  ''Ville et religion en Europe du XVIe au XXe siècle - La cité réenchantée''], la pierre et l'écrit, 2010, p.11)&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the urban project, which diverts man from God, will at the last be judged severely.

The city is also the location of spiritual conflict. It therefore bears a profound meaning, a spiritual mark, which is the sign of malediction, and the founder of the city is cursed among all. "It is through slavery that Israel is linked to the city." All the cities, within the Bible, are cursed, and "never a word of hope, never a word of pardon for the city, for it is a terrible manifestation of the brilliant morning star, which has debased humanity." This malediction explains all the difficulties, all the problems encountered in cities, and however much one may seek solutions (security, urbanism, isolation), man will never make the city anything but that which it is. Here, one can detect the influence of Ellul's good friend [[Bernard Charbonneau]]. "Ellul was constantly recognizing his debt to Charbonneau", said pastor and theologian Jean-Sébastien Ingrand, director of the Strausbourg Protestant Media Library. Together they published "Outline of a personalist manifesto", in which they denounced, among other things, the city as contrary to liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ellul et Bernard Charbonneau, ''Directives pour un manifeste personnaliste'', 1935, texte dactylographié édité par les groupes d'Esprit de la région du Sud-ouest; publié en 2003 par [http://www.worldcat.org/title/cahiers-jacques-ellul-no-1-les-annees-personnalistes-pour-une-critique-de-la-societe-technicienne/oclc/52772778&amp;referer=brief_results les Cahiers Jacques-Ellul n°1, "''Les années personnalistes''"], p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; "The man of the city is rich in money but poor in space and time", they wrote. "The city is a place of inhumanity, especially the ''[[banlieue]]'', a banal and homogeneous space, the exact opposite of the country. The city is a place of artifice, where nature is vanquished. But note: one must not romanticize nature, which is perfectly capable of defending itself alone. It is man who is fragile, and above all his liberty. Bernard Charbonneau with [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jardin-de-babylone/oclc/2547227&amp;referer=brief_results ''Le jardin de Babylone''] (1969) and Jacques Ellul with [http://www.worldcat.org/title/sans-feu-ni-lieu-signification-biblique-de-la-grande-ville/oclc/2138310&amp;referer=brief_results Jacques Ellul, ''Sans feu, ni lieu''] (1975), rediscovered this point.&lt;ref name="Roger Cans"&gt;Roger Cans, ''compte-rendu d’un colloque sur Bernard Charbonneau, précurseur de l’écologie'', organisé du 2 au 4 mai 2011 à l’IRSAM (université de Pau). "L’homme des villes est riche d’argent, mais pauvre d’espace et de temps », écrivent-ils. « La ville est un lieu d’inhumanité, la banlieue surtout, espace banalisé et uniforme, l’exact opposé de la campagne. La ville est un lieu d’artifice, où la nature est vaincue. Mais attention : il ne faut pas idéologiser la nature, qui se défend très bien toute seule. C’est l’homme qui est fragile, et surtout sa liberté. Bernard Charbonneau avec ''Le jardin de Babylone'' (1969) et Jacques Ellul avec Jacques Ellul, ''Sans feu, ni lieu'' (1975), se retrouvent sur ce point"&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has grown to the size foretold by Ellul and Charbonneau, who were witnessing the urbanization of the world, the universalization of technique, and the standardization of all civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Luc Porquet]], « Nous tous pareils » in [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jacques-ellul-lhomme-qui-avait-presque-tout-prevu/oclc/401756457&amp;referer=brief_results ''Jacques Ellul - L'homme qui avait (presque) tout prévu''], Le Cherche-Midi, 2003, p. 151-158&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in 2008, the world's urban population surpassed its rural population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronoo.com/fr/articles/population-mondiale.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Where Charbonneau applied the symbol of [[Babylon]], Ellul focuses on [[Ninevah]]. The big city is a mass which cannot survive without sacrificing liberty. "This, then, is what separates the two men: against the catastrophism of Charbonneau, Ellul presents a Christian hope, which leads from the Garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem foretold in Revelations.".&lt;ref name="Roger Cans"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3617">'''Tone terracing''' is a type of [[phonetics|phonetic]] [[downdrift]], where the high or mid [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], but not the low tone, shift downward in pitch ([[downstep (phonetics)|downstep]]) after certain other tones. The result is that a tone may be realized at a certain pitch over a short stretch of speech, shifts downward and then continues at its new level, then shifts downward again, until the end of the [[prosodic unit|prosodic contour]] is reached, at which point the [[pitch reset]]s. A graph of the change in pitch over time of a particular tone resembles a [[terrace (agriculture)|terrace]].

Since the pitch of the low tone remains more-or-less constant at the lower end of the speaker's vocal range, while the other tones shift downward, the difference in their pitches narrows, eventually obscuring the tones altogether. At this point pitch reset is required if the tone system is to continue functioning.

Tone terracing is particularly common in the languages of [[West Africa]], where typically only the low tone causes downstep. However, a somewhat more intricate system is found in the [[Twi language]] of [[Ghana]]. Twi has three phonemic tones: high, mid, and low. A word, and therefore a prosodic chunk of speech, may only start with a high tone or a low tone on its first syllable. As in many languages, a low tone starts out and remains at the bottom of the speaker's range. After a low tone, a subsequent high tone is downstepped. (A temporary exception occurs when a single low tone is found between two high tones. In this case the low tone is raised from its base value, but the second high tone is still downstepped, and subsequent low tones return to the base pitch.)

However, a phonetic downstep occurs between any two adjacent mid tones as well. In fact, a high tone is defined as any tone that is at the same pitch as a preceding high ''or mid'' tone; a mid tone will always be lower in pitch than a preceding high or mid tone. The result is that every instance of a mid or low tone shifts the upper end of the pitch range downward, until all pitches are reset at the end of the prosodic melody.

'''''Table 1.''' The phonetic terracing effect in Twi of a series of mid tones. (Twi constrains the first tone to be either high or low.)''

From tables 2 and 3 it can be imagined that the tone sequences ''high-low-high'' and ''high-mid-high'' may be difficult for a non-native speaker to distinguish.

'''Linguistic transparency''' is a phrase which is used in multiple, overlapping subjects in the fields of [[linguistics]] and the philosophy of language. It has both [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and [[descriptive]] senses.

==Normative==
Normatively, the phrase may describe the effort to suit one's rhetoric to the widest possible audience, without losing relevant information in the process. 

Advocates of normative linguistic transparency often argue that linguistic opacity is dangerous to a democracy. These critics point out that jargon is deliberately employed in government and business. It encrypts morally suspect information in order to dull reaction to it: for example, the phrase "[[collateral damage]]" to refer to the [[manslaughter]] of innocents.

One play upon this view was by [[William Strunk, Jr.]] and [[E. B. White]], who in the ''[[Elements of Style]]'' ruled that the writer ought to "eschew obfuscation".

The [[Plain Language Movement]] is an example of people who advocate using clearer, common language within the wider academic community.

Professor at New York University [[Alan Sokal]], perpetrator of the [[Sokal hoax]], is another noteworthy example of an advocate of linguistic transparency.

Writer and political philosopher [[George Orwell]] was a proponent of this view, which he captured in the landmark essay, "[[Politics and the English Language]]." Orwell wrote a novel, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'', about a [[dystopia]]n future controlled through a politically crafted language called "[[Newspeak]]."  Newspeak is a language that is linguistically transparent in the descriptive sense, but not in the normative one.

Comedian [[George Carlin]] has famously parodied the phenomenon in his stand-up comedy.

The approach may sound like common sense, but it faces the difficulty of figuring out how to communicate complex and uncommon ideas in a popular way.

==Descriptive==
Semantic transparency is a descriptive phrase that has been used in linguistics to describe [[endocentric]] compounds. Endocentric compound words are those whose whole meaning can be figured out by an analysis of its parts or "morphemes". An example of an endocentric compound is the word "car-wash". By contrast, some compound words are exocentric, meaning their whole meaning cannot be established by an analysis of parts; for example, the word "hogwash". Exocentric words are also known as semantically opaque.

{{Wiktionary|Uncle Tom}}

'''Uncle Tom''' is the title character of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s 1852 novel, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Uncle Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "Uncle Tom" is also used as a derogatory [[epithet]] for an exceedingly subservient person, particularly when that person is aware of their own lower-class status based on race. The use of the epithet is the result of later works derived from the original novel. 

==Original characterization and critical evaluations==
At the time of the novel's initial publication in 1851, Uncle Tom was a rejection of the existing stereotypes of [[minstrel show]]s; Stowe's melodramatic story humanized the suffering of slavery for white audiences by portraying Tom as a Jesus-like figure who is ultimately martyred, beaten to death by a cruel master because he refuses to betray the whereabouts of two women who had escaped from slavery.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="parfait"&gt;{{cite book |last=Parfait |first=Claire |year=2007 |title=The publishing history of Uncle Tom's cabin, 1852–2002 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=978-0-7546-5514-5 |pages=1–2, 6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J-IaLbTxpVYC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Uncle+Tom&amp;ei=T5zmSYC9GoOIzQTwnJTBCA |accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stowe reversed the gender conventions of slave narratives by juxtaposing Uncle Tom's passivity against the daring of three [[African American]] women who escape from slavery.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;

The novel was both influential and commercially successful, published as a serial from 1851 to 1852 and as a book from 1852 onward.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="parfait" /&gt; An estimated 500,000 copies had sold worldwide by 1853, including unauthorized reprints.&lt;ref name="meer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meer |first=Sarah |year=2005 |title=Uncle Tom mania: slavery, minstrelsy, and transatlantic culture in the 1850s |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=978-0-8203-2737-2 |pages=1–4, 9, 14–15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKu7Tp8_-6wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Uncle+Tom&amp;ei=T5zmSYC9GoOIzQTwnJTBCA |accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Charles Sumner]] credited ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' for the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], an opinion that is later echoed in the apocryphal story of Lincoln greeting Stowe with the quip "So you're the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war!" (see [[American Civil War]])&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=R.|first=Vollaro, Daniel|date=2009-01-01|title=Lincoln, Stowe, and the 'Little Woman/Great War' Story: The Making, and Breaking, of a Great American Anecdote|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0030.104/--lincoln-stowe-and-the-little-womangreat-war-story-the-making?rgn=main;view=fulltext|journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|issn=1945-7987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Douglass]] praised the novel as "a flash to light a million camp fires in front of the embattled hosts of slavery".&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt; Despite Douglass's enthusiasm, an anonymous 1852 reviewer for [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s publication ''The Liberator'' suspected a racial double standard in the idealization of Uncle Tom:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Uncle Tom's character is sketched with great power and rare religious perception. It triumphantly exemplifies the nature, tendency, and results of Christian non-resistance. We are curious to know whether Mrs. Stowe is a believer in the duty of non-resistance for the White man, under all possible outrage and peril, as for the Black man… [For whites in parallel circumstances, it is often said] Talk not of overcoming evil with good—it is madness! Talk not of peacefully submitting to chains and stripes—it is base servility! Talk not of servants being obedient to their masters—let the blood of tyrants flow! How is this to be explained or reconciled? Is there one law of submission and non-resistance for the Black man, and another of rebellion and conflict for the white man? When it is the whites who are trodden in the dust, does Christ justify them in taking up arms to vindicate their rights? And when it is the blacks who are thus treated, does Christ require them to be patient, harmless, long-suffering, and forgiving? Are there two Christs?&lt;ref name="liberator"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--anonymous--&gt; |year=2004 |origyear=1852 |title=Untitled review, republished in A Routledge literary sourcebook on Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's cabin by Debra J. Rosenthal |publisher=&lt;!--William Lloyd Garrison (original publisher)--&gt;Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-23473-3 |page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eptkDlB3J4kC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Uncle+Tom&amp;ei=T5zmSYC9GoOIzQTwnJTBCA |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[James Weldon Johnson]], a prominent figure of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], expresses an  antipathetic opinion in his autobiography:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For my part, I was never an admirer of Uncle Tom, nor of his type of goodness; but I believe that there were lots of old Negroes as foolishly good as he.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1949, American writer [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] rejected the [[emasculation]] of the title character "robbed of his humanity and divested of his sex" as the price of spiritual salvation for a dark-skinned man in a fiction whose African-American characters, in Baldwin's view, were invariably two dimensional stereotypes.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="baldwin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baldwin |first=James |date=2006 |origyear=1949 |title=Everybody's Protest Novel (partial republication) |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-02352-9 |pages=118–121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1loJe4UmHPAC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=James+Baldwin+Uncle+Tom&amp;ei=oMznSfD8MZ2EyAT_z_nTCA |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Baldwin, Stowe was closer to a pamphleteer than a novelist and her artistic vision was fatally marred by polemics and racism that manifested especially in her handling of the title character.&lt;ref name="baldwin" /&gt; Stowe had stated that her sons had wept when she first read them the scene of Uncle Tom's death, but after Baldwin's essay it ceased being respectable to accept the melodrama of the Uncle Tom story.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt; Uncle Tom became what critic Linda Williams describes as "an epithet of servility" and the novel's reputation plummeted until feminist critics led by [[Jane Tompkins]] reassessed the tale's female characters.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt; 

According to Debra J. Rosenthal, in an introduction to a collection of critical appraisals for the ''Routledge Literary Sourcebook on Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin'', overall reactions have been mixed with some critics praising the novel for affirming the humanity of the African American characters and for the risks Stowe assumed in taking a very public stand against slavery before abolitionism had become a socially acceptable cause, and others criticizing the very limited terms upon which those characters' humanity was affirmed and the artistic shortcomings of political melodrama.&lt;ref name="rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenthal |first=Debra J. |year=2004 |title=A Routledge literary sourcebook on Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's cabin |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-23473-3 |pages=30–31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eptkDlB3J4kC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Uncle+Tom&amp;ei=T5zmSYC9GoOIzQTwnJTBCA |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
A specific impetus for the novel was the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], which imposed heavy fines upon law enforcement personnel in Northern states if they refused to assist the return of people who escaped from slavery.&lt;ref name="parfait" /&gt;&lt;ref name="law"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Fugitive Slave Act |publisher=U.S. Constitution Online |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/fslave.html |accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new law also stripped African Americans of the right to request a jury trial or to testify on their own behalf, even if they were legally free, whenever a single claimant presented an [[affidavit]] of ownership.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt; The same law authorized a $1000 fine and six months imprisonment for anyone who knowingly harbored or assisted a fugitive slave.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt; These terms infuriated Stowe, so the novel was written, read, and debated as a political [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] tract.&lt;ref name="parfait" /&gt;

Stowe drew inspiration for the Uncle Tom character from several sources. The best-known of these was [[Josiah Henson]], an ex-slave whose autobiography, ''[[The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself]]'', was originally published in 1849 and later republished in two extensively revised editions after the publication of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''.&lt;ref name="winks"&gt;{{cite book |last=Winks |first=Robin W. |year=2003 |title=Autobiography of Josiah Henson: An Inspiration for Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom (introduction) |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-42863-5 |pages=v–vi,x–xi,xviii–xix |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCYuNTzua2cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Uncle+Tom&amp;ei=T5zmSYC9GoOIzQTwnJTBCA |accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henson was enslaved at birth in 1789.&lt;ref name="winks" /&gt; He became a Christian at age eighteen and began preaching.&lt;ref name="winks" /&gt; Henson attempted to purchase his freedom for $450, but after selling his personal assets to raise $350 and signing a promissory note for the remainder Henson's owner raised the price to $1000; Henson was unable to prove that the original agreement had been for a lesser amount.&lt;ref name="winks" /&gt; Shortly afterward Henson was ordered on a trip south to [[New Orleans]]. When he learned that he was to be sold there, he obtained a weapon. He contemplated murdering his white companions with the weapon, but decided against violence because his Christian morals forbade it.&lt;ref name="winks" /&gt; A sudden illness in one of his companions forced their return to [[Kentucky]], and shortly afterward Henson escaped north with his family, settling in Canada where he became a civic leader.&lt;ref name="winks" /&gt;

Stowe read the first edition of Henson's narrative and later confirmed that she had incorporated elements from it into ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''.&lt;ref name="winks" /&gt; Kentucky and New Orleans figure in both Henson's narrative and the novel's settings, and some other story elements are similar.&lt;ref name="winks" /&gt;

In the public imagination, however, Henson became synonymous with Uncle Tom.&lt;ref name="winks" /&gt; After Stowe's death her son and grandson claimed she and Henson had met before ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was written, but the chronology does not hold up to scrutiny and she probably drew material only from his published autobiography.&lt;ref name="winks" /&gt;

==Epithet==
In short terms, Uncle Tom is labeled to persons, similar to ''snitch'' or ''betrayer'', whose motive is driven by acceptance that doing slavery was just how the (antebellum) Southern society worked, whether the acceptance is spontaneous or coerced.

The term "Uncle Tom" is used as a derogatory [[epithet]] for an excessively subservient person, particularly when that person perceives their own lower-class status based on race. It is similarly used to negatively describe a person who betrays their own group by participating in its oppression, whether or not they do so willingly.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uncle Tom"&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;s=uncle+tom&amp;i=0&amp;h=00#c "Uncle Tom"]. Wordnet.princeton.edu. Retrieved April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term has also, with more intended neutrality, been applied in psychology in the form "[[Uncle Tom syndrome]]", a term for the use of subservience, appeasement and passivity to cope with intimidation and threats.

The popular negative connotations of "Uncle Tom" have largely been attributed to the numerous derivative works inspired by ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in the decade after its release, rather than the original novel itself, whose title character is a more positive figure.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Linda |year=2002 |title=Playing the Race Card: Melodramas of Black and White from Uncle Tom to O.J.

===History===
[[File:Legree.png|thumb|250px|Uncle Tom, from an 1885 [[magic lantern]] series.]]
American copyright law before 1856 did not give novel authors any control over derivative stage adaptations, so Stowe neither approved the adaptations nor profited from them.&lt;ref name="morgan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Jo-Ann |year=2007 |title=Uncle Tom's cabin as visual culture |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=978-0-8262-1715-8 |pages=1–5, 11–12, 17–19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlZST4X2UIAC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=James+Baldwin+Uncle+Tom&amp;ei=oMznSfD8MZ2EyAT_z_nTCA |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minstrel show]] retellings in particular, usually performed by white men in [[blackface]], tended to be derisive and [[pro-slavery]], transforming Uncle Tom from Christian martyr to a [[fool (stock character)|fool]] or an [[apologist]] for slavery.&lt;ref name="meer" /&gt;

Adapted theatrical performances of the novel, called [[Tom Shows]], remained in continual production in the United States for at least 80 years.&lt;ref name="morgan" /&gt; These representations had a lasting cultural impact and influenced the pejorative nature of the term ''Uncle Tom'' in later popular use.&lt;ref name="meer" /&gt;

Although not all minstrel depictions of Uncle Tom were negative, the dominant version developed into a stock character very different from Stowe's hero.&lt;ref name="meer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="richardson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Riché |year=2007 |title=Black masculinity and the U.S. South: from Uncle Tom to gangsta |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=978-0-8203-2890-4 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlcS25xYsC4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Uncle+Tom&amp;ei=T5zmSYC9GoOIzQTwnJTBCA |accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stowe's Uncle Tom was a muscular and virile man who refused to obey when ordered to beat other slaves; the stock character of minstrel shows became a shuffling [[asexuality|asexual]] individual with a receding hairline and graying hair.&lt;ref name="richardson" /&gt;  To Jo-Ann Morgan, author of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin as Visual Culture'', these shifting representations undermined the subversive layers of Stowe's original characterization by redefining Uncle Tom until he fit within prevailing racist norms.&lt;ref name="morgan" /&gt; Particularly after the Civil War, as the political thrust of the novel which had arguably helped to precipitate that war became obsolete to actual political discourse, popular depictions of the title character recast him within the apologetics of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]].&lt;ref name="morgan" /&gt; The virile father of the abolitionist serial and first book edition degenerated into a decrepit old man, and with that transformation the character lost the capacity for resistance that had originally given meaning to his choices.&lt;ref name="morgan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="richardson" /&gt; Stowe never meant Uncle Tom to be a derided name, but the term as a pejorative has developed based on how later versions of the character, stripped of his strength, were depicted on stage.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news |last=Keyes |first=Allison |date=2002-11-29 |title=NPR: A New Look at 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' |work=[[The Tavis Smiley Show]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=860450 |accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claire Parfait, author of ''The Publishing History of Uncle Tom's Cabin, 1852–2002'', opines that "the many alterations in retellings of the Uncle Tom story demonstrate an impulse to correct the retellers' perceptions of its flaws" and "the capacity of the novel to irritate and rankle, even a century and a half after its first publication".&lt;ref name="parfait" /&gt;
