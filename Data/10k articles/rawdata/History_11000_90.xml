The '''first millennium''' was a period of time spanning the years [[AD 1]] to [[AD 1000]] ([[1st century|1st]] to [[10th century|10th]] centuries; in astronomy: [[Julian day|JD]] {{val|1721425.5|fmt=gaps}} &amp;ndash; {{val|2086667.5|fmt=gaps}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1227779487 Julian Day Number from Date Calculator (casio.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;).
[[World population estimates|World population]] rose more slowly than during the [[1st millennium BC|preceding millennium]], from about 200 million in AD 1 to about 300 million in AD 1000.&lt;ref name=HYDE2011&gt;Klein Goldewijk, K. , A. Beusen, M. de Vos and G. van Drecht (2011). The HYDE 3.1 spatially explicit database of human induced land use change over the past 12,000 years, Global Ecology and Biogeography20(1): 73-86. {{doi|10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00587.x}} ([http://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/download/index-2.html pbl.nl]).
Goldewijk et al. (2011) estimate 188 million as of AD 1, citing a literature range of 170 million (low) to 300 million (high).
Out of the estimated 188 million, 116 million are estimated for Asia ([[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Central Asia]], excluding [[Western Asia]]),
44 million for Europe and the [[Near East]], 15 million for Africa (including [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]] and [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman North Africa]]), 12 million for [[Mesoamerica]] and South America. North America and Oceania were at or below one million.
For AD 1000, they estimate the world population at 295 million .

&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Eurasia ([[Europe]] and [[Near East]]), the first millennium was a time of great transition from [[Classical Antiquity]] to the [[Middle Ages]]. The 1st century saw the peak of the [[Roman Empire]], followed by its gradual decline during the period of [[Late Antiquity]], the rise of [[Christianity]] and the [[Migration Period|Great Migrations]]. The second half of the millennium is characterized as the [[Early Middle Ages]] in Europe, and marked by the [[Viking Age|Viking expansion]] in the west, the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the east.
[[Islamic conquests|Early Islam]] expands rapidly from [[Arabia]] to   West Asia, North Africa and the [[Iberian peninsula]]., culminating in the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (700–1200 AD).

In [[East Asia]], the first millennium was also a time of great cultural advances, notably the [[spread of Buddhism]] to East Asia. In [[History of China|China]], the [[Han dynasty]] is replaced by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] and later the [[Tang dynasty]] until the 10th century sees renewed fragmentation in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. In [[History of Japan|Japan]], a sharp increase in population followed when farmers' use of iron tools increased their productivity and crop yields. The [[Kofun period#Yamato court|Yamato court]] was established.

In [[South Asia]], the [[Indian subcontinent]] was divided among [[Middle kingdoms of India|numerous kingdoms]] throughout the first millennium, until the formation of the [[Gupta Empire]].

In [[Mesoamerica]], the first millennium was a period of enormous growth known as the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Era]] (200–900 AD). [[Teotihuacan]] grew into a metropolis and its empire dominated Mesoamerica. In [[South America]], pre-Incan, [[Moche (culture)|coastal]] [[Nazca|cultures]] flourished, producing impressive metalwork and some of the finest pottery seen in the ancient world.
In [[North America]], the [[Mississippian culture]] rose at the end of the millennium in the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] river valleys. Numerous cities were built; [[Cahokia]], the largest, was based in present-day [[Illinois]].  The construction of [[Monks Mound]] at Cahokia was begun in 900–950 AD.

In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Bantu expansion]] reaches [[Southern Africa]] by about the 5th century.
The [[Arab slave trade]] spans the [[Sahara]] and the [[Swahili coast]] by the 9th century.

'''Aage Friis''' (16 August 1870 in [[Korsør]], [[Denmark]]&lt;ref&gt;Relevant für die unterschiedlichen Angaben des Geburtsortes Korsör/Halskov&lt;/ref&gt; – 5 October 1949 in [[Hellerup]]) was a Danish historian and university lecturer.

== Life ==
Friis completed his studies in 1896 with a master's degree in history. He was a member of the university library at the [[University of Copenhagen]] from 1891 to 1900, during which he graduated with a doctorate in 1899 with a dissertation on [[Andreas Peter Bernstorff]] and [[Ove Høegh-Guldberg]]. In 1913, he became the history professor at the University of Copenhagen, where he remained until his retirement in 1935. He was rector of the university in 1932/1933. In 1919 he was one of the co-founders of the [[Foreningen Norden]].

Friis was concerned with Danish history in its relations with Germany. Here, the [[Bernstorff]] family presented one of its main themes in the history of the early modern period; his two-volume work ''The Bernstorffs and Denmark'' were also translated into German. He also appeared as a Danish biographer of the young [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] before his reign in Denmark. Before and after the [[First World War]], he became a member of the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]], partly as an employee of the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the [[Southern Jutland]] issue, which resulted in [[Nordschleswig]] being Danish again after the war as a result of the [[Schleswig plebiscites, 1920|Schleswig plebiscites of 1920]]. He was friends with the German historian [[Friedrich Meinecke]]. He was buried at Solbjerg Parkkirkegård in [[Frederiksberg]].

'''Aijaz Ahmad''' (born 1932) is a [[Marxist]] philosopher, [[literary theorist]] and [[political]] commentator. He is currently the Chancellor's Professor at the UC Irvine School of Humanities’ Department of Comparative Literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Releases|url=http://www.humanities.uci.edu/SOH/about/press_release_det.php?id=347|website=UCI SoH|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Born in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], India Aijaz Ahmad and his parents migrated to [[Pakistan]] following [[Partition of India|partition]]. After his education he worked in various universities in US and Canada. Before joining UC Irvine in 2017, he was professorial fellow at the Centre of Contemporary Studies, [[Nehru Memorial Museum and Library]], [[New Delhi]] and was visiting professor of [[political science]] at [[York University, Toronto]].  He also works as an editorial consultant with the [[India]]n newsmagazine ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'' and as a senior news analyst for the Indian website [[Newsclick]].

==Work==

In his book ''In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures'', Ahmad primarily discusses the role of theory and theorists in the movement against colonialism and imperialism. Ahmad's argument against those who uphold poststructuralism and postmodernist conceptions of material history revolves around the fact that very little has been accomplished since the advent of this brand of postcolonial inquiry. The book contains an especially polemical critique of [[Frederic Jameson]]'s argument in 'Third World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism" where Ahmad attacks Jameson on the grounds that Jameson's argument is insufficiently theorized in its use of terms like "Third World" which appears to be defined purely in terms of its experience of colonialism. This in turn leads Jameson to make hasty and untenable generalizations about how all "third world literature' would necessarily function as a national allegory that according to Jameson works as resistance to a system of global postmodernism.

Ahmad in his book expresses his chagrin at how his critique of Jameson has been appropriated by Postcolonial scholars as an attack on Marxism, while Ahmad contends that he takes issue with Jameson simply because his use of Marxism in the essay on Third World Literature is not rigorous enough. 
The book also contains a lengthy critique of Edward Said's Orientalism which Ahmad argues reproduces the very Liberal Humanist tradition that it seeks to undermine in its selection of Western canonized texts that are critiqued for their Orientalism, as this upholds the idea that Western culture is represented in its entirety through those very texts. Furthermore, Ahmad asserts that by tracing Orientalist thought all the way back to Ancient Greece it becomes unclear in Said's work whether Orientalism is a product of Colonialism, or whether Colonialism is, in fact, a product of Orientalism.

[[Image:Stoledeacon.jpg|thumb|right|An Anglican cleric vested as a [[deacon]], with alb and [[cincture]] and a purple [[Stole (vestment)|stole]]]] 
The '''alb''' (from the Latin ''Albus'', meaning ''white''), one of the [[liturgy|liturgical]] [[vestments]] of the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]], and [[Methodist]] churches, is an ample white garment coming down to the ankles and is usually girdled with a [[cincture]] (a type of belt, sometimes of rope similar to the type used with monk garments). It is simply the long, white linen [[tunic]] used by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]].

As a simple derivative of ordinary first-century clothing, the alb was adopted very early by Christians, and especially by the clergy for the [[Eucharist]]ic liturgy. In early Medieval Europe it was also normally worn by [[secular clergy]] in non-liturgical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Piponnier, Françoise, and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; p. 114, [[Yale University Press]]; 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, the alb is the common vestment for all [[Minister of religion|minister]]s at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], both [[cleric]]s and [[Laity|laypersons]], and is worn over the [[cassock]] and under any other special garments, such as the [[stole (vestment)|stole]], [[dalmatic]] or [[chasuble]]. If the alb does not completely cover the collar, an [[amice]] is often worn underneath the alb. The shortening of the alb for use outside a church has given rise to the [[surplice]], and its cousin the [[rochet]], worn by [[canon (priest)|canon]]s and [[bishop]]s. Post-Tridentine albs often were made with lace. Since then, this detail has fallen out of style, except in parts of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] movement and some very traditional Arab Catholic parishes.

==Variants==
(Both not allowed in Roman Catholic Rite)&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Liturgy&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chasuble-alb''' is a contemporary Eucharistic vestment that combines features of the [[chasuble]] and alb. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], it was first adopted in France, though without official approval. In France it is no longer fashionable, but it has been officially approved in some tropical countries such as the [[Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/Liturgy/zlitur64.htm Eternal Word Television Network, Global Catholic Network] of January 25, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Hawaii]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaiicatholicherald.org/Home/tabid/256/newsid884/921/Default.aspx Bishop Larry Silva’s Liturgical Catechesis] at the [[Hawaii Catholic Herald]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is always white in colour. A [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] of the colour appointed for the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the day is worn outside it, in place of the normal white alb and coloured chasuble.

A '''[[cassock-alb]]''' is a vestment that combines features of the [[cassock]] and alb. It developed as a more convenient undergarment worn by clergy and as an alternative to the alb for deacons and [[acolyte]]s.

Kokorinov's surviving architectural legacy, once believed to be substantial,&lt;ref&gt;Shuisky, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; has been reduced by recent research to only two buildings, the Imperial Academy of Arts and [[Kirill Razumovsky]] palace in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;Shuisky, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy was designed by [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]] based on an earlier proposal by [[Jacques-François Blondel]], while Kokorinov managed the construction in its early phases (1764–1772).

==Biography==

Alexander Kokorinov was born in [[Tobolsk]] in the family of a government clerk. At the age of 14 he began training with Johann Blank (father of [[Karl Blank]]), a self-proclaimed architect exiled from [[Saint Petersburg]] for his involvement in the alleged conspiracy of [[Artemy Volynsky]] (1740). With the ascension of [[Elisabeth of Russia|Elisabeth]] in 1741 survivors of the Volynsky affair were [[amnesty|amnestied]] and the Blanks returned to Moscow, taking Kokorinov with them.

Kokorinov and Karl Blank studied arts and architecture in Moscow under [[Ivan Korobov]], and in 1749 Kokorinov was hired by prince [[Dmitry Ukhtomsky]], then the leading Moscow architect of [[Elisabethan Baroque]] and dean of an architectural school based in [[Moscow Kremlin]]. He received the degree of Master of Mathematics from [[Moscow University]]&lt;ref&gt;Lisovsky, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1754 Kokorinov passed professional examination as a ''junior architect'', joined the staff of [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and relocated to [[Saint Petersburg]] where he made contact with count [[Ivan Shuvalov]], founder of [[Moscow State University]] (1755) and the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] (1757). Kokorinov joined the staff of the Academy since its first days.

Shuvalov initially proposed to set up the Academy in Moscow and commissioned [[Jacques-François Blondel]] to design the new campus there.&lt;ref name=S232&gt;Shvidkovsky 2007, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisabeth of Russia|Empress Elisabeth]] insisted that the Academy must be based in Saint Petersburg, and the task of adapting Blondel's plans was awarded to Kokorinov, who has already designed Shuvalov's own house in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name=S232/&gt; Kokorinov, firmly trained only in [[Baroque]] styling, struggled with Blondel's [[French Rococo and Neoclassicism|French neoclassical]] design and in 1759 Shuvalov hired another Frenchman to assist Kokorinov.&lt;ref name=S232/&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]], Blondel's cousin and a recent graduate of the [[Académie royale d'architecture|Royal Academy of Architecture]],&lt;ref name=S232/&gt; became Kokorinov's peer on the Academy project and soon surpassed him. Design of the building is traditionally credited by Kokorinov and de la Mothe,&lt;ref name=S232/&gt; but recent research in French archives indicate that it was de la Mothe's own work, while no drafts by Kokorinov were ever found.&lt;ref name=S43&gt;Shuisky, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy, a complex structure measuring 140 by 125 meters, bears traces of Blondel's style yet, according to [[Dmitry Shvidkovsky]], "is more up to date ... especially noticeable in plan. Where Blondel specified a [[corinthian order]], the stricter Roman [[doric order|Doric]] was actually used. The [[cupola]] too is more laconic than as designed by Blondel. The complete building turned out even more austere than it appears in de la Mothe's drawings."&lt;ref&gt;Shvidkovsky 2007, pp. 232-233&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1761 Kokorinov was appointed director of the Academy (subordinate to its President), but it was not until 1765 when he became its [[professor]]. He taught elementary architectural theory and history of architecture, while de la Mothe taught advanced architectural subjects.&lt;ref name=S43/&gt;

While the architects finalized their proposal, Russia was shaken by a brief reign (5 January 1762 – 9 July 1762) and murder of emperor [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], succeeded by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]]. The new empress sent Shuvalov to a [[de facto]] [[exile]] in his country estate and installed [[Ivan Betskoy]] as the new President of the Academy.&lt;ref name=S43/&gt; March 18, 1764 she authorized financing for construction in earnest and set up construction board, headed by Kokorinov.&lt;ref name=S45&gt;Shuisky, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; De la Mothe, who always shied away from practical construction, was not actively involved on site; for the first time in Russian history, architectural profession was split into architectural design and construction management.&lt;ref name=S45/&gt;

During [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russian-Turkish war of 1768–1774]] financing of the project virtually stopped, while Betskoy initiated a criminal case against alleged [[fraud]] on the site.&lt;ref name=S46/&gt; Kokorinov, blamed with cost overruns, died in 1772; unofficial opinion held it that he committed suicide.&lt;ref name=S46&gt;Shuisky, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; De la Mothe left Russia in 1775, the building was completed by [[Yury Felten]] in 1788.&lt;ref name=S46/&gt;

[[File:Edwin Smith Papyrus v2.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] documents ancient Egyptian medicine, including the diagnosis and treatment of injuries.]]
The medicine of the [[ancient Egypt]]ians is some of the oldest documented. From the beginnings of the civilization in the late fourth millennium BC until the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion of 525 BC, Egyptian medical practice went largely unchanged but was highly advanced for its time, including simple non-invasive [[surgery]], setting of [[bone|bones]], [[dentistry]], and an extensive set of [[pharmacopoeia]]. Egyptian medical thought influenced later traditions, including the Greeks.

Until the 19th century, the main sources of information about ancient Egyptian medicine were writings from later in antiquity. The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] visited Egypt around 440 BC and wrote extensively of his observations of their medicinal practice.&lt;ref&gt;Jouanna, J., &amp; Allies, N. (2012). EGYPTIAN MEDICINE AND GREEK MEDICINE. In Van der Eijk P. (Ed.), ''Greek Medicine from Hippocrates to Galen: Selected Papers'' (pp. 3-20). LEIDEN; BOSTON: Brill. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76vxr.6&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] also wrote favorably of them in historical review. [[Hippocrates]] (the "father of medicine"), [[Herophilos]], [[Erasistratus]] and later [[Galen]] studied at the temple of [[Amenhotep]], and acknowledged the contribution of ancient Egyptian medicine to [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Said|first=Galal Zaki|date=2013-11-17|title=Orthopaedics in the dawn of civilisation, practices in ancient Egypt|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00264-013-2183-z|journal=International Orthopaedics|language=en|volume=38|issue=4|pages=905–909|doi=10.1007/s00264-013-2183-z|issn=0341-2695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822, the translation of the [[Rosetta stone]] finally allowed the translation of ancient Egyptian [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] inscriptions and papyri, including many related to medical matters ([[Egyptian medical papyri]]). The resultant interest in [[Egyptology]] in the 19th century led to the discovery of several sets of extensive ancient medical documents, including the [[Ebers papyrus]], the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], the [[Hearst Papyrus]], the [[London Medical Papyrus]] and others dating back as far as 2900 BC.

The Edwin Smith Papyrus is a textbook on surgery and details [[anatomical]] observations and the "examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis" of numerous ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Edwin Smith papyrus (Egyptian medical book) |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |date= |year= |publisher= |location= |id=  |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Edwin-Smith-papyrus |access-date=1 January 2016 |edition=Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was probably written around 1600 BC, but is regarded as a copy of several earlier texts.

Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/44441040&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ebers papyrus c. 1550 BC includes 877 prescriptions (as categorized by a modern editor) for a variety of ailments and illnesses, some of them involving magical remedies, for Egyptian beliefs regarding magic and medicine were often intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;DAWSON, W.

Other documents such as the [[Hearst papyrus]] (1450 BC), and [[Brugsch Papyrus|Berlin Papyrus]] (1200 BC) also provide valuable insight into ancient Egyptian medicine.

Other information comes from the images that often adorn the walls of Egyptian tombs and the translation of the accompanying inscriptions. Advances in modern medical technology also contributed to the understanding of ancient Egyptian medicine. [[Paleopathology|Paleopathologist]]s were able to use [[X-Ray]]s and later [[CAT Scan]]s to view the bones and organs of [[mummy|mummies]]. [[Electron microscope]]s, [[mass spectrometry]] and various forensic techniques allowed scientists unique glimpses of the state of health in Egypt 4000 years ago.

==Nutrition==
The ancient Egyptians were at least partially aware of the importance of diet, both in balance and moderation.&lt;ref name="dollinger" /&gt; Owing to Egypt's great endowment of fertile land, food production was never a major issue, although, no matter how bountiful the land, paupers and starvation still exist. The main crops for most of ancient Egyptian history were [[emmer wheat]] and barley. Consumed in the form of loaves which were produced in a variety of types through baking and fermentation, with yeast greatly enriching the nutritional value of the product, one farmer's crop could support an estimated twenty adults. Barley was also used in beer. Vegetables and fruits of many types were widely grown. Oil was produced from the linseed plant and there was a limited selection of spices and herbs. Meat (sheep, goats, pigs, wild game) was regularly available to at least the upper classes and fish were widely consumed, although there is evidence of prohibitions during certain periods against certain types of animal products; Herodotus wrote of the pig as being 'unclean'. Offerings to [[Unas|King Unas]] (c. 2494–2345 BC) were recorded as

"...milk, three kinds of beer, five kinds of wine, ten loaves, four of bread, ten of cakes four meats, different cuts, joints, roast, spleen, limb, breast, quail, goose, pigeon, figs, ten other fruits, three kinds of corn, barley, spelt, five kinds of oil, and fresh plants..."

It is clear that the Egyptian diet was not lacking for the upper classes and that even the lower classes may have had some selection (Nunn, 2002).

== Pharmacology ==

Like many civilizations in the past, the ancient Egyptians amply discovered the medicinal properties of plant life around them. In the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] there are many recipes to help heal different ailments. In a small section of this papyrus, there are five recipes one dealing with problems women may have had, three on techniques for refining the complexion, and the fifth recipe for ailments that deal with the colon.&lt;ref name="Breasted"&gt;{{cite book |last=Breasted |first=James Henry |date=1930 |title=The Edwin Smith Papyrus |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027232282;view=1up;seq=7 |location=[[Chicago]], Illinois |publisher=The [[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Egyptians were known to use honey as medicine, and the juices of pomegranates served as both an astringent and a delicacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=James P |date=2005 |title=The Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jNbVl5LOjHUC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=ancient+egyptian+medicine#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20egyptian%20medicine&amp;f=false |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |page= |isbn=978-0-300-10728-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ebers Papyrus, there are over 800 remedies; some were topical like ointments, and wrappings, others were oral medication such as pills and mouth rinses;still others were taken through inhalation.&lt;ref name="Bryan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryan |first=Cyril |date=1932 |title=The Ebers Papyrus |url= |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[D.

Egyptian drug therapy is perceived ineffective by today's standards according to Michael D. Parkins who says that 28% of 260 medical prescriptions in the Hearst Papyrus had ingredient which can be perceived "to have had activity towards the condition being treated and another third supplied to any given disorder would produce a purgative effect on the gastrointestinal system&lt;ref name="Parkins2001"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Parkins|first1=Michael D.|last2=Szekrenyes|first2=J.|author-link2=|date=March 2001|title=Pharmacological Practices of Ancient Egypt|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/uofc/Others/HOM/Dayspapers2001.pdf#page=17|location=[[Calgary]], Alberta, Canada|publisher=The [[University of Calgary]]|pages=5–11|id=|author-link1=|book-title=Proceedings of the 10th Annual History of Medicine Days}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Medical knowledge in ancient Egypt had an excellent reputation; while rulers of other empires would ask the Egyptian pharaoh to send them their best physician to treat their loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prioreschi |first=Plinio |date=1996 |title=History of Medicine Volume 1: Primitive and Ancient Medicine |url= |location= |publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press]] |page=257f |isbn=978-0-77349661-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline |reason=Publisher believed to be a vanity press. |date=January 2016}}  Egyptians had some knowledge of human [[anatomy]]. For example, in the classic [[Mummy|mummification]] process, mummifiers knew how to insert a long hooked implement through a nostril, breaking the thin bone of the braincase and removing the [[brain]]. They also had a general idea that inner organs are in the body cavity. They removed the organs through a small incision in the left groin. Whether this knowledge was passed down to the practitioners is unknown; yet it did not seem to have had any impact on their medical theories.

Egyptian physicians were aware of the existence of the pulse and its connection to the heart. The author of the Smith Papyrus even had a vague idea of the cardiac system. Although he did not know about blood circulation and deemed it unimportant to distinguish between blood vessels, tendons, and nerves. They developed their theory of "channels" that carried air, water, and blood to the body by analogies with the [[River Nile]]; if it became blocked, crops became unhealthy. They applied this principle to the body: If a person was unwell, they would use [[laxatives]] to unblock the "channels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.passmoresschool.com/History/mrmodqa2.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501130207/http://www.passmoresschool.com/History/mrmodqa2.htm |archive-date=1 May 2008 |title=What progress did the Egyptians make in medical knowledge? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Medicine Through Time: Model Questions and Answers |publisher=[[Passmores Academy]] |access-date=1 January 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source? |date=January 2016}}

Many of their medical practices were effective, such as the surgical procedures given in the Edwin Smith papyrus. Mostly, the physicians' advice for staying healthy was to wash and shave the body, including under the arms, to prevent infections. They also advised patients to look after their diet, and avoid foods such as raw fish or other animals considered to be unclean.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Surgery was a common practice among physicians as treatment for physical injuries. The Egyptian physicians recognized three categories of injuries; treatable, contestable, and untreatable ailments. Treatable ailments the surgeons would quickly set to right. Contestable ailments were those where the victim could presumably survive without treatment, so patients assumed to be in this category were observed and if they survived then surgical attempts could be made to fix the problem with them. They used knives, hooks, drills, forceps, pincers, scales, spoons, saws and a vase with burning incense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/museums/greiner/ |title=Ancient Egyptian Medicine |last1=Greiner |first1=Ryan |date=2001 |website=Creighton University Virtual Museums  |publisher=[[Creighton University]] |access-date=February 2011 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other records describe initiates into the religious orders as involving circumcision which would imply that the practice was special and not widespread. The only known depiction of the procedure, in The Tomb of the Physician, burial place of [[Ankh-Mahor]] at Saqqara, shows adolescents or adults, not babies. [[Female circumcision]] may have been practiced, although the single reference to it in ancient texts may be a mistranslation.&lt;ref name="dollinger"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/medicine.htm |title=Ancient Egyptian Medicine |last1=Dollinger |first1=André |last2= |first2= |date=December 2002 |website=An introduction to the history and culture of Pharaonic Egypt |publisher=Kibbutz Reshafim |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosthetics, such as artificial toes and eyeballs, were also used; typically, they served little more than decorative purposes. In preparation for burial, missing body parts would be replaced; however, these do not appear as if they would have been useful, or even attachable, before death.&lt;ref name="dollinger"/&gt;

The extensive use of surgery, mummification practices, and autopsy as a religious exercise gave Egyptians a vast knowledge of the body's morphology, and even a considerable understanding of organ functions. The function of most major organs was correctly presumed—for example, blood was correctly guessed to be a transpiration medium for vitality and waste which is not too far from its actual role in carrying oxygen and removing carbon dioxide—with the exception of the heart and brain whose functions were switched. 

===Dentistry===
Dentistry was an important field, as an independent profession it dated from the early 3rd millennium BC, although it may never have been prominent. The Egyptian diet was high in abrasives from sand left over from grinding grain and bits of rocks in which the way bread was prepared, and so the condition of their teeth was poor. Archaeologists have noted a steady decrease in severity and incidence of worn teeth throughout 4000 BC to 1000 AD, probably due to improved grain grinding techniques.&lt;ref name="Nunn" /&gt;  All Egyptian remains have sets of teeth in quite poor states. Dental disease could even be fatal, such as for [[Djedmaatesankh]], a musician from Thebes, who died around the age of thirty five from extensive dental disease and a large infected cyst. If an individual's teeth escaped being worn down, cavities were rare, due to the rarity of sweeteners. Dental treatment was ineffective and the best sufferers could hope for was the quick loss of an infected tooth. The [[Instruction of Ankhsheshonq]] contains the maxim "There is no tooth that rots yet stays in place".&lt;ref name="dollinger"/&gt; No records document the hastening of this process and no tools suited for the extraction of teeth have been found, though some remains show sign of forced tooth removal.&lt;ref name="Nunn" /&gt;  Replacement teeth have been found, although it is not clear whether they are just post-mortem cosmetics. Extreme pain might have been medicated with [[opium]].&lt;ref name="dollinger"/&gt;

==Magic and religion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
[[Magic (paranormal)|Magic]] and [[religion]] were an integral part of everyday life in [[ancient Egypt]]. [[Egyptian mythology|Evil gods]] and [[demon]]s were thought to be responsible for many ailments, so often the treatments involved a [[supernatural]] element, such as beginning treatment with an appeal to a deity. There does not appear to have existed a clear distinction between what nowadays one would consider the very distinct callings of priest and physician. The healers, many of them priests of [[Sekhmet]], often used [[incantation]]s and magic as part of treatment.

The widespread belief in magic and religion may have resulted in a powerful [[placebo effect]]; that is, the perceived validity of the cure may have contributed to its effectiveness. The impact of the emphasis on magic is seen in the selection of remedies or ingredients for them. Ingredients were sometimes selected seemingly because they were derived from a substance, plant or animal that had characteristics which in some way corresponded to the symptoms of the patient. This is known as the principle of ''simila similibus'' ("similar with similar") and is found throughout the history of medicine up to the modern practice of [[homeopathy]]. Thus an [[ostrich]] egg is included in the treatment of a broken skull, and an [[amulet]] portraying a [[hedgehog]] might be used against [[baldness]].

Amulets in general, were very popular. They were worn for many magical purposes. Health related amulets are classified as homeopoetic, phylactic and theophoric. Homeopoetic amulets portray an animal or part of an animal, from which the wearer hopes to gain positive attributes like strength or speed. Phylactic amulets protected against harmful gods and demons. The famous [[Eye of Horus]] was often used on a phylactic amulet. [[Theophoric]] amulets represented Egyptian gods; one represented the [[girdle]] of [[Isis]] and was intended to stem the flow of blood at miscarriage. They were often made of bone, hanging from a leather strap.

==Doctors and other healers==
[[File:Prosthetic toe.jpg|thumb|This wood and leather prosthetic toe was used by an amputee to facilitate walking]]
The ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word for doctor is "swnw". This title has a long history. The earliest recorded physician in the world, [[Hesy-Ra]], practiced in [[History of Ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]]. He was  "Chief of Dentists and Physicians" to King [[Djoser]], who ruled in the 27th century BC.&lt;ref name="Arab3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabworldbooks.com/articles8c.htm |title=Medicine in Ancient Egypt - Part 3 |last=Arab |first=Sameh M. |date= |website=Arab World Books |publisher= |access-date=2011-11-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lady [[Peseshet]] (2400 BC) may be the first recorded female doctor: she was possibly the mother of [[Akhethotep]], and on a [[stela]] dedicated to her in his tomb she is referred to as ''imy-r swnwt'', which has been translated as "Lady Overseer of the Lady Physicians" (''swnwt'' is the feminine of ''swnw'').

There were many ranks and specializations in the field of medicine. Royalty employed their own ''swnw'', even their own specialists. There were inspectors of doctors, overseers and chief doctors. Known ancient Egyptian specialists are [[ophthalmologist]], [[Gastroenterology|gastroenterologist]], [[proctologist]], [[dentist]], "doctor who supervises [[butcher]]s" and an unspecified "inspector of liquids". The ancient Egyptian term for proctologist, ''neru phuyt'', literally translates as "shepherd of the anus". The latter title is already attested around 2200 BC by [[Irynachet]].

'''Astragalomancy''', also known as astragyromancy, is a form of [[divination]] that uses [[dice]] specially marked with letters or numbers.

Originally, as with [[dice games]], the "dice" were [[knucklebones]] or other small bones of quadrupeds. Marked ''astragali'' ([[talus bone]]s) of sheep and goats are common at Mediterranean and Near Eastern archaeological sites, particularly at funeral and religious locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

Also known as cleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice or bones stretches back before [[recorded history]]. The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] displayed bone "dice" (''hakata'') used by the [[Shona people]] of southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = Sets of dice (hakata) are the quintessential Shona instruments used to divine the source of illness or personal misfortune. These consist of a series of four miniature tablets, made of wood, ivory, or bone, each with a distinct design motif inscribed on one side. According to Shona conceptions of experience, personal difficulties—ranging from unemployment or poor grades in school to the death of one's livestock—may all be attributed to some spiritual agency. Consequently, a distinction is made between medical treatment of certain ailments and a diviner's probing analysis and diagnosis of the ultimate cause of a client's problems.

They have been in use for thousands of years, and remain extant.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Since astragalomancy is a form of [[sortition]], numbers are scrawled into the dice; the numbers are associated{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} with letters, thus bearing on the questions of the diviner. The diviner then casts the dice, resulting in a random sequence of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;"Astragalomancy." Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology. Ed. J. Gordon Melton. 5th ed. Vol. 1. Detroit: Gale Group, 2001. 100. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 27 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The diviner interprets this sequence according to certain rules – usually rules specific to his/her religion (e.g. [[Buddhism]]).

Astragalomancy is considered{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} the twin of '''pessomancy''' (also known as '''psephomancy''') – another act of divination which uses colored or marked pebbles as opposed to numbered dice. These pebbles are either thrown out of a bag after shuffling or drawn from the bag at random. The interpretation of the colors or symbols relate to issues such as health, communications, success, and travel.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Tibetan Buddhism==
The [[Dalai Lama]] is reported as using the ''[[Mo (divination)|mo]]'', balls of dough in which have been placed pieces of paper with possible "choices" written on them, to help in making important decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_osnos#ixzz11AhCeMMQ Evan Osnos, Profiles, “The Next Incarnation,” ''The New Yorker'', October 4, 2010, p. 63]&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan divination has long featured the ''mo'' in making everyday decisions, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Historical significance==
This is a small fortified settlement which has yielded several plant remains.&lt;ref name=singh&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Upinder|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India : from the Stone Age to the 12th century|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788131711200|pages=137, 157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Floral remains==
Several plant remains were found here include various types of barley, wheat, rice, horsegram, green gram, various types of pea, sesamum, melon, watermelon, grapes, dates, garlic etc. (Saraswat and Pokharia - 2001-2)&lt;ref name=singh/&gt; which is comparable to a nearby IVC site [[Kunal, Haryana]] revealed remains of rice (probably wild).

===Earliest garlic===
The plant remains found here include a garlic specimen, recognised as the earliest evidence of garlic.&lt;ref name=singh/&gt; This is the earliest evidence of garlic cloves in south &amp; south-east Asia, and it dates to the Mature Harappan period.

'''Basic Battle Skills''' is a field training manual formerly issued to individual soldiers in the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Basic Battle Skills. Army Code 71090 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

Editions were modified over a period of approximately 25 years before the book was withdrawn from issue.

==Format==
The manual was divided into seven chapters, each one an illustrated set of instructions on how to carry out the most basic subjects taught to soldiers during their first weeks of training. 
[[File:Basic Battle Skills - Contents page.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Contents page]]
*Individual Fieldcraft and Minor Tactics
*Map Reading
*Basic First aid
*Health and Hygiene
*NBC Defence (NBC=Nuclear, Biological and Chemical [warfare])
*administration and morale
*Physical Fitness

The opening chapter ''Individual Fieldcraft and Minor Tactics'' starts with the information: ''A sound knowledge of Fieldcraft and Minor Tactics will help you in combat to:''&lt;ref&gt;Basic Battle Skills p1&lt;/ref&gt;

*Fight
*Live
*Protect yourself and your equipment
*Remain fit
*Be an asset to your commander

In the first chapter the manual describes in more detail the skills needed in Fieldcraft and Minor Tactics.  Commencing with "Judging Distance" and describing methods on how to ascertain how far a subject is from the soldier up to ranges of 400 [[metre]]s and recommending that weapon sights be carefully adjusted for accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Battle Skills p2&lt;/ref&gt;  The chapter also gives guidance on "Personal [[Camouflage]]",  "Target Recognition", "Fire Control Orders", "Movement in the field", "Movement at night", "Night Noises", "Night vision", "Sentry duties", "Sentries at night in the field", "Rifle section formations", "Field signals (on foot)", "Advancing towards the enemy", "Weapon handling", "Ammunition" and "Trenches".&lt;ref&gt;Basic Battle Skills pp1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustrations==
[[File:Basic Battle Skills - diagram.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Illustration gives instruction complementing the wording of the page.]]
The book contains simple illustrations with vivid colours detailing in pictures what the wording of each section instructs a soldier to do in various situations.  For example: in chapter one instructions are provided on the method and wording to be used when challenging movement of persons approaching the sentry position.  The manual instructs the sentry to call out, "Halt, who goes there?  Advance one and be recognised."  When approached in response to this command the sentry is instructed to use the "challenge" part of the password and to expect the correct reply before allowing any further movement of the person(s) approaching his position.  The password will have previously been set by the officers in command and have been made known to every soldier within the formation.  It will take the form of two simple words, for example: the challenge part could be "sausages" and the reply "chips".  Therefore, the sentry calls out "sausages" and expects the reply "chips".  If the correct reply is not received the sentry would be expected to open fire on the enemy approaching as anyone without the password is to be treated as an enemy.

The illustration to the right shows in words and pictures how a sentry should perform his duties in the event of requiring to challenge a person or persons who approach him.

The '''Battle of Savra''' ({{lang-sq|Beteja e Savrës}}, {{lang-sr|Битка на Саурском пољу}}, {{lang-tr|Savra Muharebesi}}; "Battle on the Saurian field") or the '''Battle of the Vjosë'''{{Sfn|Kiel|1990|p=17}} was fought on 18 September 1385 between [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and much smaller [[Zeta under the Balšići|Zeta]]n forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Група аутора|title=Историја српксог народа II|publisher=Српска књижевна задруга|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Savra field near [[Lushnjë]] (in modern-day southern [[Albania]]). The Ottomans were invited by [[Karlo Thopia]] to support him in his feud against [[Balša II]].&lt;ref name="Somel2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Somel|first=Selcuk Aksin|title=The A to Z of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBoyoNNKh78C&amp;pg=PA14|year=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8108-7579-1|page=14|quote=...the Ottomans supported Lord Carlo Thopia against Balsha II, defeating the latter...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1372, Balša II married Komnina, the daughter of [[John Komnenos Asen]], the [[Principality of Valona|Despot of Valona]].{{Cref2|A}} As a dowry, Balša gained the cities of Valona (modern [[Vlorë]]), [[Berat]] and [[Kaninë|Kanina]] (in modern-day southern Albania), located in Asen's province.&lt;ref&gt;Fine 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QDFVUDmAIqIC&amp;pg=PA372 p. 372]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1385 [[Balša II]] conquered Durazzo (modern [[Durrës]]), presumably from [[Karl Topia]]. In a charter to Ragusa issued in April 1385, he called himself "Duke of Durazzo". The expansion of Balšić's realm into Epirus brought him to the frontline against the Ottomans. Being aware of Ottoman aspirations to his territory, on 8 August 1385 Balša II asked Venetians to support him with four galleys.{{Sfn|Ivić|Mrđenović|Spasić|Palavestra|1987|p=102}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecrits historiques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-nTAAAAMAAJ|year=1987|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Battle ==
Karlo Thopia invited Ottomans to support him in conflict with Balša II. Thopia's invitation was accepted and [[Çandarlı Kara Halil Hayreddin Pasha|Hayreddin Pasha]]&lt;ref name="Houtsma1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Houtsma|first=M. Th.|authorlink=M. Th. Houtsma|title=E.J.

News about incursion of the Ottoman forces into the region of Berat reached Balša II while he was in Durrës.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Recueil des travaux de la Faculté de philosophie: Les sciences historiques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9d87AQAAIAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Univerzitet|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Mavro Orbini]], Balša II rounded up one thousand men in Durrës and, ignoring the advice of his nobles, headed out to take on the Ottoman raiders.{{Sfn|Fine|1994|p=390}} Unsurprisingly, Balša's small forces had little success and Balša II was killed. Orbini's work is the only source that mention Ivaniš Mrnjavčević as participant in this battle. Some scholars believe he did not even exist, while other believe that he was not independent medieval lord, but loyal member of Balšić family.&lt;ref&gt;Veselinović, Andrija &amp; Ljušić, Radoš (2001). СРПСКЕ ДИНАСТИЈЕ, СРЕДЊОВЕКОВНЕ ДИНАСТИЈЕ&lt;/ref&gt; Another person mentioned only by Orbini is Balša's [[voivode]] Đurađ Krvavčić, described as brave warrior who also died in this battle. Mavrini explains that body of Balša II was decapitated and his head taken to Hayreddin Pasha.

The work of [[Mavro Orbini]] (''The Realm of the Slavs'') is one of the main primary sources about this battle. It contains many incorrect and imprecise data.{{sfn|Орбин|1968|p=321}} Another primary source about the Battle of Savra is [[Marin Barleti]] who explained that Balša II was brave and idealistic.&lt;ref name="Barleti2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barleti|first=Marin|authorlink=Marin Barleti|title=The Siege of Shkodra: Albania's Courageous Stand Against Ottoman Conquest, 1478|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zeZ963q3ok0C&amp;pg=PA60|year=2012|publisher=David Hosaflook|isbn=978-99956-87-77-9|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This battle set foundation for centuries-long Ottoman presence in this part of the Balkans.

{{History of Morocco}}
The '''Great Berber Revolt''' of 739/740–743 AD (122–125 AH in the [[Muslim calendar]]) took place during the reign of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] and marked the first successful secession from the Arab caliphate (ruled from Damascus). Fired up by [[Kharijite]] puritan preachers, the [[Berber people|Berber]] revolt against their Umayyad Arab rulers began in [[Tangiers]] in 740, and was led initially by [[Maysara al-Matghari]]. The revolt soon spread through the rest of the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa) and across the straits to [[al-Andalus]].

The Umayyads scrambled and managed to prevent the core of [[Ifriqiya]] (Tunisia, East-Algeria and West-Libya) and al-Andalus (Spain and Portugal) from falling into rebel hands. But the rest of the [[Maghreb]] was never recovered. After failing to capture the Umayyad provincial capital of [[Kairouan]], the Berber rebel armies dissolved, and the western Maghreb fragmented into a series of small Berber statelets, ruled by tribal chieftains and Kharijite imams. 
 
The Berber revolt was probably the largest military setback in the reign of Caliph Hisham. From it, emerged some of the first Muslim states outside the Caliphate. It is sometimes also regarded as the beginning of Moroccan independence, as [[Morocco]] would never again come under the rule of an eastern Caliph or any other foreign power until the 20th century.

==Background==
The underlying causes of the revolt were the policies of the [[Umayyad]] governors in [[Kairouan]], [[Ifriqiya]], who had authority over the [[Maghreb]] (all of [[North Africa]] west of Egypt) and [[al-Andalus]].

From the early days of the Muslim conquest of North Africa, [[Arab]] commanders had treated non-Arab (notably [[Berber people|Berber]]) auxiliaries inconsistently, and often rather shabbily. When they arrived in North Africa the [[Umayyad]]s had to face a Christian-majority population in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsularis]] (which became [[Ifriqiya]], modern-day [[Tunisia]]) and pagans in the Maghreb al-Aqsa (now [[Morocco]]) with Jewish minorities. Some Berbers of the Maghreb quickly converted and participated in the growth of Islam in the region, but the Arab authorities continued to treat them as second-class people.

Although Berbers had undertaken much of the fighting in the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]], they were given a lesser share of the spoils and frequently assigned to the harsher duties (e.g. Berbers were thrown into the vanguard while Arab forces were kept in the back; they were assigned garrison duty on the more troubled frontiers). Although the Ifriqiyan Arab governor [[Musa ibn Nusair]] had cultivated his Berber lieutenants (most famously, [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad|Tariq ibn Ziyad]]), his successors, notably [[Yazid ibn Abi Muslim]], had treated their Berber forces particularly poorly.&lt;ref&gt;Dhannun Taha (1989: 198)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most grievously, Arab governors continued to levy extraordinary ''[[dhimmi]]'' taxation (the ''[[jizyah]]'' and ''[[kharaj]]'') and slave-tributes on non-Arab populations that had converted to Islam, in direct contravention of [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. This had become particularly routine during the caliphates of [[Walid I]] and [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik|Sulayman]].

In 718, the Umayyad caliph [[Umar bin Abd al-Aziz|Umar II]] finally forbade the levying of extraordinary taxation and slave tributes from non-Arab Muslims, defusing much of the tension. But expensive military reverses in the 720s and 730s had forced caliphal authorities to look for innovative ways to replenish their treasuries. During the caliphate of [[Hisham]] from 724, the prohibitions were sidestepped with reinterpretations (e.g. tying the ''kharaj'' land tax to the land rather than the owner, so that lands that were at any point subject to the ''kharaj'' remained under ''kharaj'' even if currently owned by a Muslim).

As a result, resentful Berbers grew receptive to radical [[Kharijite]] activists from the east (notably of [[Sufri]]te and later [[Ibadi]]te persuasion) which had begun arriving in the Maghreb in the 720s. The Kharijites preached a puritan form of Islam, promising a new political order, where all Muslims would be equal, irrespective of ethnicity or tribal status, and Islamic law would be strictly adhered to. The appeal of the Kharijite message to Berber ears allowed their activists to gradually penetrate Berber regiments and population centers. Sporadic mutinies by Berber garrisons (e.g. under Munnus in [[Cerdanya]], Spain, in 729-31) were put down with difficulty. One Ifriqiyan governor, [[Yazid ibn Abi Muslim]], who openly resumed the ''jizya'' and humiliated his Berber guard by branding their hands, was assassinated in 721.&lt;ref name="Africa"&gt;{{citation|last=Hrbek|first=Ivan|title=Africa from the Seventh to the Eleventh Century|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06698-4 |volume=3rd|year=1992|page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 734, [[Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab]] was appointed Umayyad governor in Kairouan, with supervisory authority over all the [[Maghreb]] and [[al-Andalus]]. Coming in after a period of mismanagement, Ubayd Allah soon set about expanding the fiscal resources of the government by leaning heavily on the non-Arab populations, resuming the extraordinary taxation and slave-tribute without apologies. His deputies Oqba ibn al-Hajjaj al-Saluli in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] (Al-Andalus) and Omar ibn el-Moradi in [[Tangier]] (Maghreb) were given similar instructions. The failure of expensive expeditions into [[Gaul]] during the period 732-737, repulsed by the Franks under [[Charles Martel]], only increased the tax burden. The parallel failure of the caliphal armies in the east brought no fiscal relief from [[Damascus]].

== The Revolt ==
{{Campaignbox Berber Wars}}
=== Revolt in the Maghreb ===
{{See also|Battle of the Nobles}}
The zeal of the Umayyad tax-collectors finally broke Berber patience. It is reported that following Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab's instructions to extract more revenues from the Berbers, Omar ibn al-Moradi, his deputy governor in Tangiers, decided to declare the Berbers in his jurisdiction a 'conquered people' and consequently set about seizing Berber property and enslaving persons, as per the rules of conquest, the '[[royal fifth|caliphal fifth]]' was still owed to the Umayyad state (alternative accounts report he simply doubled their tribute).

This was the last straw. Inspired by the [[Sufri]]te preachers, the North African Berber tribes of western Morocco - initially, the [[Ghomara people|Ghomara]], [[Berghwata]] and [[Miknasa]] - decided to break openly into revolt against their Arab overlords. As their leader, they chose [[Maysara al-Matghari]], alleged by some Arab chroniclers to be a lowly water-carrier (but more probably a high [[Matghara]] Berber chieftain).

The only question was timing. The opportunity arose sometime in late 739 or early 740 (122 AH), when the powerful Ifriqiyan general [[Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri]], who had recently been imposing his authority on the [[Sous]] valley of southern Morocco, received instructions from the Kairouan governor Ubayd Allah to lead a large expedition across the sea against Byzantine [[Sicily]]. Gathering his forces, Habib ibn Abi Obeida marched the bulk of the Ifriqiyan army out of Morocco.

As soon as the mighty Habib was safely gone, Maysara assembled his coalition of Berber armies, heads shaven in the Sufri [[Kharijite]] fashion and with [[Qur'an|Qura'nic]] inscriptures tied to their lances and spears, and brought them bearing down on [[Tangiers]]. The city soon fell into rebel hands and the hated governor Omar al-Moradi was killed. It was at this point that Maysara is said to have taken up the title and pretences of ''[[amir al-mu'minin]]'' ("Commander of the Faithful", or "Caliph"). Leaving a Berber garrison in Tangier under the command of Christian convert, Abd al-Allah al-Hodeij al-Ifriqi, Maysara's army proceeded to sweep down western Morocco, swelling its ranks with new adherents, overwhelming Umayyad garrisons clear from the [[Straits of Gibraltar|Straits]] down to the [[Sous]]. One of the local governors killed by the Berbers was Ismail ibn Ubayd Allah, the very son of the Kairouan emir.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, p.216-17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berber revolt surprised the Umayyad governor in Kairouan, Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab, who had very few troops at his disposal. He immediately dispatched messengers to his general Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri in Sicily instructing him to break off the expedition and urgently ship the Ifriqiyan army back to Africa. In the meantime, Ubayd Allah assembled a cavalry-heavy column, composed of the aristocratic Arab elite of Kairouan. He placed the nobles under the command of [[Khalid ibn Abi Habib al-Fihri]], and dispatched it to Tangiers, to keep the Berber rebels contained, while awaiting Habib's return from Sicily. A smaller reserve army was placed under Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Mughira al-Abdari and instructed to hold [[Tlemcen]], in case the Berber rebel army should break through the column and try to drive towards Kairouan.

Maysara's Berber forces encountered the vanguard Ifrqiyan column of Khalid ibn Abi Habib somewhere in the outskirts of Tangiers &lt;ref&gt;Following Ibn Khaldun (p.217), commentators usually mark that encounter at the [[Chelif]] river (in Algeria). However, it is unlikely that the Berber rebels would have reached that far east so soon.  It is likely Ibn Khaldun or his transcribers confused that location with a similar-sounding one, closer to Tangiers.  Julien (1961: p.30) suggests it was in the upper reaches of the [[Sebou river]].&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief skirmish with the Arab column, Maysara abruptly ordered the Berber armies to fall back to Tangier. The Arab cavalry commander Khalid ibn Abi Habiba did not give pursuit, but just held his line south of Tangier, blockading the Berber-held city, while awaiting the reinforcements from Habib's Sicilian expedition.  
 
In this breathing space, the Berber rebels got reorganized and undertook an internal coup. The Berber tribal leaders swiftly deposed (and executed) Maysara and elected the [[Zenata]] Berber chieftain, [[Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati]] as the new Berber 'caliph'. The reasons for Maysara's fall remain obscure. Possibly the sudden cowardice shown before the Arab cavalry column proved him military unfit, possibly because the puritan Sufrite preachers found a flaw in the piety of his character, or maybe simply because the [[Zenata people|Zenata]] tribal chieftains, being closer to the Ifriqiyan frontline, felt they should be the ones leading the rebellion.

The new Berber leader Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati opted to immediately attack the idling Ifriqiyan column before they could be reinforced. The Berber rebels under Khalid ibn Hamid overwhelmed and annihilated the Arab cavalry of Khalid ibn Abi Habiba in an encounter known as the [[Battle of the Nobles]], on account of the veritable massacre of the cream of the Ifriqiyan Arab nobility. This is tentatively dated around c. October–November, 740.

The immediate Arab reaction to the disaster shows just how unexpected this reversal was. Upon the first news of the defeat of the nobles, the reserve army of Ibn al-Mughira in Tlemcen fell into a panic. Seeing Sufrite preachers everywhere in the city, the Umayyad commander ordered his nervous Arab troops to conduct a series of round-ups in Tlemcen, several of which ended in indiscriminate massacres. This provoked a massive popular uprising in the hitherto-quiet city. The city's largely Berber population quickly drove out the Umayyad troops. The frontline of the Berber revolt now leaped to the middle Maghreb ([[Algeria]]).&lt;ref name="Blankinship 1994, p.208"&gt;Blankinship (1994, p.208)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicilian expeditionary army of Habib ibn Abi Obeida arrived too late to prevent the massacre of the nobles. Realizing they were in no position to take on the Berber army by themselves, they retreated to Tlemcen, to gather the reserves, only to find that city too was now in disarray. There, Habib encountered Musa ibn Abi Khalid, an Umayyad captain who had bravely stayed behind in the vicinity of Tlemcen gathering what loyal forces he could find. The state of panic and confusion was such that Habib ibn Abi Obeida decided to blame the guiltless captain for the entire mess and cut off one of his hands and one of his legs in punishment.&lt;ref name="Blankinship 1994, p.208"/&gt;

Habib ibn Abi Obeida entrenched what remained of the Ifriqiyan army in the vicinity of Tlemcen (perhaps as far back as [[Tahert]]), and called upon Kairouan for reinforcements. The request was forwarded to [[Damascus]].

Caliph Hisham, hearing the shocking news, is said to have exclaimed: "By God, I will most certainly rage against them with an Arab rage, and I will send against them an army whose beginning is where they are and whose end is where I am!" &lt;ref&gt;Blankinship, 1994:p.209&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coup in al-Andalus ===

It is sometimes reported that the Andalusian governor [[Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj]] dispatched an Andalusian army across the straits to support the Ifriqiyan column around Tangiers, only to be similarly defeated by the Berber rebels in late 740. But this story has been discounted by modern historians, as it is sourced principally from later al-Andalus chronicles; there is nothing in contemporary accounts referencing any such expedition.

Nonetheless, the news of the Berber victory in Morocco echoed through al-Andalus. Berbers heavily outnumbered Arabs in al-Andalus. Fearing the Berber garrisons in their own lands might take inspiration from their Moroccan brethren, the Andalusian Arab elite quickly deposed Obeid Allah's deputy, Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj, in January 741 and reinstated his predecessor, [[Abd al-Malik ibn Katan al-Fihri]], a more popular figure among local Arabs and Berbers alike.&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship, 1994: p.209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Syrian Expedition===

{{Main|Battle of Bagdoura}}

In February, 741, the Umayyad Caliph Hisham appointed [[Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qasi]] to replace the disgraced Obeid Allah as governor in Ifriqiya. Kulthum was to be accompanied by a fresh Arab army of 30,000 - 27,000 raised from the regiments (''junds'') of [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]]&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, the 27,000 Syrian troops were composed of 6,000 men from each of the four main Syrian ''junds'' of [[Jund Dimashq|Jund Dimashq (Damascus)]], [[Jund Hims|Jund Hims (Homs)]], [[Jund al-Urdunn|Jund al-Urdunn (Jordan)]], and [[Jund Filastin|Jund Filastin (Palestine)]], plus 3,000 from [[Jund Qinnasrin]]&lt;/ref&gt; and an additional 3,000 to be picked up in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Dozy, Reinhart (1913) ''Spanish Islam: A History of the Muslims in Spain'' (translated by Francis Griffin Stokes from the Spanish ''Histoire de Musulmans d'Espagne'') Chatto &amp; Windus, London, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AtQ7yAftTdQC&amp;pg=PA133 page 133], {{OCLC|3191175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caliph Hisham appointed Kulthum's nephew [[Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri]] as his lieutenant and designated successor, and the Jordanian commander [[Thalaba ibn Salama al-Amili]] as his second successor (should tragedy befall the prior two).

The elite Syrian cavalry under Balj ibn Bishr, which had moved ahead of the bulk of the forces, was the first to arrive in Kairouan in the Summer of 741. Their brief stay was not a happy one. The Syrians arrived in haughty spirits and quarreled with the Kairouan city authorities, who suspicious, had given them a rather cool reception. Interpreting it as ingratitude, the Syrian barons imposed themselves on the city, billeting troops and requisitioning supplies without regard to local authorities or priorities.

(It is pertinent to note that the members of the Syrian expedition were of different tribal stock than the Arabs they came to save. The early Arab colonists of Ifriqiya and al-Andalus had been drawn largely from tribes of south Arabian origin (known as [[Kalbid]] or '[[Yemen]]ite' tribes), whereas the Syrian ''junds'' were mostly of north Arabian tribes ([[Qais|Qaysid]] or [[Mudhar]]ite, or '[[Syrian]]' tribes).{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The ancient and deep pre-Islamic tribal rivalry between Qaysid and Yemenite found itself invoked in repeated quarrels between the earlier colonists and the arriving ''junds''.)
 
Moving slower with the bulk of the forces, Kulthum ibn Iyad himself did not enter Kairouan, but merely dispatched a message assigning the government of the city to [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Oqba al-Ghaffari]], the ''[[qadi]]'' of Ifriqiya. Collecting the Syrian vanguard, Kulthum hurried along to make junction with the remaining Ifriqiyan forces (some 40,000) of Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri holding ground in the vicinity of Tlemcen.

The junction between the North African and Eastern forces did not go smoothly.&lt;ref name="Blankinship, p.211"&gt;Blankinship, p.211&lt;/ref&gt; News of the Syrian misbehavior in Kairouan had reached the Ifriqiyan troops, while the Syrians, incensed at the poor reception, treated their Ifriqiyan counterparts in a high-handed fashion. Habib and Balj bickered and the armies nearly came to blows. By smooth diplomacy, Kulthum ibn Iyad managed hold the armies together, but the mutual resentments would play a role in subsequent events.

The Berber rebel army, under the leadership of [[Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati]] (perhaps jointly with a certain Salim Abu Yusuf al-Azdi &lt;ref name="Blankinship, p.211"/&gt;), while boasting great numbers (some 200,000), were very poorly equipped. Many Berber fighters had nothing but stones and knives, dressed in a mere loin cloth, heads shaved in puritan fashion. But they made up for this in knowledge of the terrain, excellent morale, and a fanatical Sufrite-inspired religious fervor.

The Berber and Arab armies finally clashed at the [[Battle of Bagdoura]] (or Baqdura) in October–November, 741, by the [[Sebou River|Sebou river]] (near modern [[Fes]]). Disdaining the experience and cautious advice of the Ifriqiyans, Kulthum ibn Iyad made several serious tactical errors. Berber skirmishers dehorsed and isolated the Syrian cavalry, while the Berber foot fell upon the Arab infantry with overwhelming numbers. The Arab armies were quickly routed. By some estimates, two-thirds of the Arab army were killed or captured by the Berbers at Bagdoura.&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship, p.212&lt;/ref&gt; Among the casualties were the new governor [[Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qasi]] and the Ifriqiyan commander Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri.

The Syrian regiments, now reduced to some 10,000, were pulled together by Kulthum's nephew, [[Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri|Balj ibn Bishr]] and scrambled up towards the [[Straits of Gibraltar|straits]], where they hoped to get passage across the water to al-Andalus. A small Ifriqiyan contingent, under Habib's son [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri]], joined the Syrians in their flight, but the rest of the Ifriqiyan forces fled in a scattered way back to Kairouan. The bulk of the Berber rebel army set off in pursuit of the Syrians, and laid siege to them in [[Ceuta]].

=== Offensive on Kairouan ===

The Zenata Berber leader [[Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati]] who delivered the two great victories over the Arab armies disappears from the chronicles shortly after Bagdoura (741).&lt;ref&gt;Fournel (1857: p.79)&lt;/ref&gt; But news of the defeat emboldened hitherto quiet Berber tribes to join the revolt. Berber uprisings erupted across the Maghreb and al-Andalus.

The most immediate threat arose in southern Ifriqiya, where the Sufrite leader [[Oqasha ibn Ayub al-Fezari]] raised a Berber army and laid sieges to [[Gabès]] and [[Gafsa]]. By a rapid sally south with the remnant of the Ifriqiyan army, the Kairouan ''[[qadi]]'' Abd al-Rahman ibn Oqba al-Ghaffari managed to defeat and disperse Oqasha's forces near Gafsa in December, 741.&lt;ref&gt;Blankship, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; But the qadi possessed far too few Arab troops to put up a pursuit, and Oqasha immediately set about re-assembling his forces quietly around [[Tobna]] in the [[Biskra (province)|Zab]] valley of western Ifriqiya.

Immediately after hearing of the disaster at Bagdoura, the Caliph Hisham ordered the Umayyad governor of [[Egypt]], [[Handhala ibn Safwan al-Kalbi]], to quickly take charge of Ifriqiya. In February 742, Handhala ibn Safwan hurried his Egyptian army westwards and reached Kairouan around April 742, just as Oqasha was returning to try his luck again. Handhala's forces pushed Oqasha back again.

When Oqasha was reassembling his forces once more in the Zab, he came across a large Berber army coming from the west, under the command of the [[Hawwara]] Berber chieftain [[Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid al-Hawwari]] (possibly dispatched by the Berber caliph Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati, although he is not mentioned in the chronicles). Abd al-Wahid's army was composed of some 300,000 Berber troops, ostensibly the largest Berber army ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun (1857: p.363); Fournel (1857: p.79)&lt;/ref&gt; After a quick consultation, Oqasha and Abd al-Wahid agreed on a joint attack on Kairouan, Oqasha taking his forces along a southerly route, while Abd al-Wahid led his large army through the northern passes, converging on Kairouan from both sides.

Hearing of the approach of the great Berber armies, Handhala ibn Safwan realized it was paramount to prevent their junction. Dispatching a cavalry force to harass and slow down Abd al-Wahid in the north, Handhala threw the bulk of his forces south, crushing Oqasha in a bloody battle at [[El-Qarn]] and taking him prisoner. But Handhala had taken a lot of losses himself, and now faced the unhappy prospect of Abd al-Wahid's gigantic army. Hurrying back, Handhala is said to have put the entire population of Kairouan under arms to bolster his ranks, before setting out again. In perhaps the bloodiest encounter in the Berber wars, Handhala ibn Safwan defeated the great Berber army of Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid at [[El-Asnam]] around May 742 (perhaps a little later), just three miles outside of Kairouan. Some 120,000-180,000 Berbers, including Abd al-Wahid, fell in the field of battle in that single encounter. Oqasha was executed shortly after.

Although Kairouan was saved for the caliphate, and with it the core of Ifriqiya, Handhala ibn Safwan now faced the unenvious task of dragging the more westerly provinces, still under Berber sway, back into the fold. He would not have the chance to accomplish this.

=== Revolt in al-Andalus ===
[[File:Vasconia wide 740 3 - 80.jpg|thumb|225px|Military campaigns in northeastern al-Andalus and southern Gaul at the time of the Berber Revolt (739–742)]]
{{History of al-Andalus}}
The coup installing [[Abd al-Malik ibn Qatan al-Fihri]] as ruler in al-Andalus in early 741 had been a failsafe device. But once the news of the disaster at Bagdoura spread, a general Berber uprising in al-Andalus could no longer be prevented. In October 741, Berber garrisons north of the [[Douro River]] mutinied. They discarded their Arab commanders and took to the field, abandoning their garrison posts to assemble their own Berber rebel army around the center and march against the Andalusian Arabs in the south.

Although their leaders' names have escaped us, the Andalusian Berber rebel army was organized into three columns&amp;mdash;one to take [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] (the main garrison city of the central march), another to aim for [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] (the Umayyad capital), and the third to take [[Algeciras]], where the rebels hoped to seize the Andalusian fleet to ferry additional Berber troops from North Africa.

With the frontier garrisons in the north west suddenly evacuated, the Christian king [[Alfonso I of Asturias]] could hardly believe his luck, and set about dispatching Asturian troops to seize the empty forts. With remarkable swiftness and ease the northwestern was captured, and the banks of the upper Ebro were raided by Alfonso and permanently lost to al-Andalus. The Asturians devastated several towns and villages on the banks of the [[Douro River]], and carried off local populations from the towns and villages in the Galician-Leonese lowlands back to the mountains, creating an empty buffer zone in the [[Douro River]] valley (the ''[[Desert of the Duero]]'') between the Asturias in the north and al-Andalus in the south. This newly emptied frontier would remain in place for the next few centuries. It is alleged that pastoral Berber mountaineers remained behind in the highlands around [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] and [[León, Spain|León]]. These trapped Berber communities were called "''[[Maragatería|Maragatos]]''" by the local Christian Leonese (etymology uncertain, possibly from ''mauri capti'', "captive Moors"). Although eventually converted to Christianity, the ''Maragatos'' retained their distinctive dress, customs and lifestyle of Berber origin down to the early modern era.

=== The Syrians in Al-Andalus ===

Through much of the winter of 741-42, the remnant of the Syrian expedition, some 10,000 men, under [[Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri|Balj ibn Bishr]], remained trapped in [[Ceuta]], besieged by the Berber rebels. The Andalusian ruler [[Abd al-Malik ibn Qatan al-Fihri]], wary that the presence of the Syrians in Al-Andalus would only aggravate matters, refused them passage across the water. Indeed, he forbade any relief of the stranded Syrians, going so far as to publicly torture to death an Andalusian merchant who had dared to dispatch a couple of grain boats to Ceuta to feed the desperate Syrians.&lt;ref&gt;al-Maqqari (1840-43, v.2, p.41), Mercier (1888: p.234);&lt;/ref&gt;

But news soon reached the Andalusian governor that the Berber rebel armies from the north west had been organized and were now barreling south in three columns, towards Toledo, Córdoba and Algeciras.

Not having enough Arab forces at hand, the Andalusian governor Abd al-Malik realized he had little choice but to make use of the stranded Syrian force to defeat the Berber armies. In a carefully negotiated treaty, Abd al-Malik granted the Syrians permission to cross over, on the condition that they promise to return to North Africa within a year of the settlement of the Berber matter in Al-Andalus. Hostages were taken to secure Syrian compliance.

The Syrian junds under Balj ibn Bishr crossed the straits in early 742 and immediately headed to the environs of [[Medina-Sidonia]], where they intercepted and disposed of the Berber column aiming for Algeciras. The Syrians then joined the Andalusian Arabs in crushing the main Berber rebel army in a ferocious battle outside of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in the Spring of 742. Shortly after, they proceeded to defeat the third Berber army, then laying siege to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].

The Berber rebellion was quashed in Al-Andalus, but the Syrians showed no signs of intending to leave. When the Andalusian governor Abd al-Malik ibn Qatan ibn Fihri pressed the point, Balj ibn Bishr, decided to simply depose him and proclaim himself governor, invoking his credentials as designated successor to his uncle, the late Ifriqiyan governor [[Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qasi]]. In revenge for the merchant of Ceuta, Balj ordered the elderly Ibn Qatan tortured to death.

A civil war was not short in happening. Rallied by Qatan and Umayya, the sons of the late [[Fihrid]] governor, Andalusian Arabs took up arms against the Syrian ''junds''. The Syrians delivered a decisive defeat upon the Andalusian at the [[Battle of Aqua Portora]] outside of Córdoba in August 742, but Balj ibn Bishr was mortally wounded in the field. Command of the Syrian armies devolved to [[Thalaba ibn Salama al-Amili]], and for the next few months, the Syrians remained bunkered down, while the Andalusian (soon joined by what remained of the Beber rebels), assembled in [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]].

Much of the next few months was spent in an intercenine Arab civil war, the Berber question relegated to a secondary concern. Eventually, tiring of war, the parties, appealed to the Ifriqiyan emir [[Handhala ibn Safwan al-Kalbi]] to resolve the matter. Handhala dispatched his cousin [[Abu l-Hattar al Husam ibn Darar al-Kalbi|Abu al-Khattar ibn Darar al-Kalbi]] as the new governor for al-Andalus. Abu al-Khattar arrived in May 743 and immediately set about restoring peace in Al-Andalus, liberating prisoners (Arab and Berber) and figuring a resolution to the displaced Syrian troops. He decided to distribute the various Syrian junds across Al-Andalus, carving out regimental fiefs in hitherto thinly-held areas: the Damascus jund was established in Elvira ([[Granada]]), the Jordan jund in Rayyu ([[Málaga]] and [[Archidona]]), the Palestine jund in [[Medina-Sidonia]] and [[Jerez]], the Emesa (Hims) jund in [[Seville]] and [[Niebla, Spain|Niebla]] and the Qinnasrin jund in [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]]. The Egypt jund was divided between [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]] (Algarve) in the west and Tudmir ([[Murcia]]) in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Provençal, (1950: p.48); Kennedy (1996: p.45).&lt;/ref&gt; (Al-Maqqari refers to an additional ''jund'' from [[Wasit, Iraq|Wasit]] (Iraq) that was settled in [[Cabra, Spain|Cabra]], but this ''jund'' is not recorded in other sources).&lt;ref&gt;Al-Maqqari (1840-43: p.46)&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian junds were allocated a third of the tax revenues collected in their regions, and given responsibilities of tax-collection and military service to the Andalusian governor.

The arrival of the Syrian ''junds'' would have tremendous implications for subsequent Andalusian history. They increased substantially the Arab element on the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]], and, as such, were instrumental in deepening the Muslim hold on the south, what would become the heart of al-Andalus. But they also brought trouble. Unwilling to be governed, the Syrian ''junds'' carried on an existence of autonomous feudal anarchy, severely destabilizing the power of the governor of al-Andalus.

==Later years==
[[File:Morocco and the Maghreb after the Berber Revolt.PNG|thumb|right|240px|The Maghreb after the Berber Revolt&lt;ref name="Duby" /&gt;]]
It is common to denote 742 or 743 as the 'end' of the Great Berber Revolt, after the failure of the Berber armies to seize Kairouan or [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]. But the Berber hold on Morocco as well as the western and central parts of the [[Algeria|Maghrib al-Awsat]] (Central Maghreb, modern-day Algeria) would continue, leading to the establishment of the [[Barghwata]] state in [[Morocco|Tamesna]] by 744, [[Abu Qurra]]'s state in [[Tlemcen]] by 742 and the [[Midrarid]] emirate in [[Sijilmassa]] by 758, while Arab hold would last over [[Al-Andalus]] and [[Ifriqiya]], including the eastern part of modern-day Algeria.

Later, non Berber dynasties came to power with Berber support, such as the [[Rustamid dynasty|Rustamids]], a dynasty of [[Persia]]n descent who by 761 established an [[Imamate]] over the area of [[Tahert]],&lt;ref&gt;Yassir Benhima, [http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=865&amp;lang=en The Rustamids (761-909)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921202516/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=865&amp;lang=en |date=2013-09-21 }}, on qantara-med.org (retrieved on 18 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/514123/Rustamid-kingdom Rustamid Kingdom], on Britannica (retrieved on 18 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; in modern-day [[Algeria]], and the [[Sharif]]ian [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisids]] in [[Morocco]], by 789 considered as the founder dynasty of the modern Moroccan state.&lt;ref&gt;"tradition (...) reaches back to the origins of the modern Moroccan state in the ninth century Idrisid dynasty which founded the venerable city of.

By this era, though not organized as states, many areas were ruled by [[Kharijite]] rebels such as [[Djerba]], [[Wargla]], [[Setif]], [[Tozeur]], [[Gafsa]] and the [[Nafusa Mountains|Djebel Nafusa]].&lt;ref name="Duby"&gt;Georges Duby, ''Atlas Historique Mondial'', Larousse Ed.

'''Catherine "Caryl" Glyn Davies''' (née '''Catherine Glyn Jones'''; 26 September 1926 – 22 February 2007) was a Welsh historian of philosophy and linguistics, and a translator. 

==Biography==
Catherine Glyn Jones was born in [[Trealaw]], [[Glamorgan]], on 26 September 1926. Her father, William Glyn Jones (1883-1958), was a minister, and she was the eldest of four. She attended Porth county school, and in 1846, she graduated with first-class honours in French, before receiving honours in philosophy from the [[University College of Wales]] in [[Aberystwyth]]. She furthered her studies at the university and graduated in 1949 with a Masters, for which she produced the thesis ''A critical study of John Locke's examination of Père Malebranche's opinion of seeing all things in God''. She spent a year at [[Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] after winning a Kemsley travelling fellowship. She studied the philosophic relations between England and France in the late 1600s at Sorbonne, before returning and enrolling at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], where she authored ''The influence of John Locke on literature and thought in eighteenth century France: a study of Locke's influence on the development of the theory of knowledge in France between 1734 and 1748'' in 1954.&lt;ref name="DWB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s10-DAVI-GLN-1926.html|title=DAVIES, CATHERINE GLYN (‘CARYL’)|publisher=''[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]'', [[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies married Gareth Alban Davies (1926-2009), whom she had met at Oxford, in the summer of 1953;&lt;ref name=YoMCGJ&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=66BBSbONTCZAjfQ%2Fp7YN%2FA&amp;scan=1|title=Index of English and Welsh marriages: Catherine G.

She began translating works into Welsh; [[André Gide]]'s ''[[La Symphonie pastorale]]'' was translated with her husband in 1965 and published as ''Y Deillion''. As a linguist, she authored two articles on [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[s:The Student|The Student]]'' (1894) in 1994–95 and translated [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Cossacks (novel)|The Cossacks]]'' into ''Y Cosaciaid'' in 1998.&lt;ref name="DWB"/&gt;

Davies received a PhD at [[Leeds University]] in 1989 for a thesis entitled ''Conscience as Consciousness: the idea of self-awareness in French philosophical writing from Descartes to Diderot contains a concise but comprehensive discussion which is often referred to'', first published the following year. In 2000, authored a work on the history of Celtic scholarship entitled ''Adfeilion Babel: agweddau ar syniadaeth ieithyddol y ddeunawfed ganrif'', which according to the ''[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]'' traces the "development of the ideas of grammarians, lexicographers and linguists regarding the beginnings and development of language and the inter-relationship of languages" and discusses the work of the likes of [[John Davies (Mallwyd)]], [[Edward Lhuyd]], and [[Paul-Yves Pezron]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. She continued to research extensively, though in later years was hampered by poor eyesight.&lt;ref name="DWB"/&gt;

Although the Davies' lived in [[Yorkshire]] for three decades, they taught their children the Welsh language.&lt;ref name="PoemHunter.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Gareth Alban Davies|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/gareth-alban-davies/biography/|website=PoemHunter.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in hospital in [[Aberystwyth]] on 22 February 2007 from [[septicaemia]], caused by a ruptured [[gastric ulcer]]. Her funeral was held at [[Tabor chapel]] in [[Llangwyryfon]], before she was cremated at [[Aberystwyth Crematorium]].&lt;ref name="DWB"/&gt;

==Name==
It has been speculated by scholars whether "Dhul-Nun" was an [[honorific]] (''laqab'') for the mystic rather than his name proper, which is sometimes believed to be Thawbān.&lt;ref&gt;Mojaddedi, Jawid, “Dhū l-Nūn Abū l-Fayḍ al-Miṣrī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE'', Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson. Brill Online.&lt;/ref&gt; As "Dhul-Nun," literally meaning "the one of the fish [or whale]," is another name for the [[Hebrew]] [[prophet]] [[Jonah]] in Islamic tradition, it is sometimes believed that this title was given to Dhul-Nun in commemoration of Jonah.&lt;ref&gt;Mojaddedi, Jawid, “Dhū l-Nūn Abū l-Fayḍ al-Miṣrī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE'', Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson. Brill Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Dhul-Nun is one of the most prominent saints of early Islamic tradition, appearing "in the earliest accounts of Ṣūfism as the leading figure of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;Mojaddedi, Jawid, “Dhū l-Nūn Abū l-Fayḍ al-Miṣrī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE'', Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson. Brill Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Often depicted as the spiritual master of [[Sahl al-Tustari]] (c. 818-896), the traditional hagiographies relate that the latter refused to engage in mystical discourse until after Dhul-Nun's death, on account of his recognition of Dhul-Nun's elevated rank in wisdom and [[gnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Mojaddedi, Jawid, “Dhū l-Nūn Abū l-Fayḍ al-Miṣrī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE'', Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson.

Dhul-Nun al-Misri is considered among the most prominent saints of early [[Sufism]] and holds a position in the Sufi chronicles as high as [[Junayd Baghdadi]] (d. 910) and [[Bayazid Bastami]] (d. 874). He studied under various teachers and travelled extensively in [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and [[Syria]]. The Muslim scholar and Sufi [[Sahl al-Tustari]] was one of Dhul-Nun al-Misri's students.&lt;ref name="HerbertMason"&gt;{{cite book

A.J. Arberry, London; Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Dhul-Nun's name came about in relation to an incident on a sea voyage. He was falsely accused of stealing a
jewel from a merchant. He cried out "O Creator, Thou knowest best", whereupon a large number of fish raised their heads above the waves, each bearing a jewel in its mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-30/new-age-insight/29599854_1_jewel-sufism-fish|title=Man of the fish - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A legendary [[alchemist]] and thaumaturge, he is supposed to have known the secret of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. His sayings and poems, which are extremely dense and rich in mystical imagery, emphasize knowledge or [[gnosis]] (''[[marifah]]'') more than fear (''makhafah'') or love (''mahabbah''), the other two major paths of spiritual realization in Sufism. None of his written works have survived, but a vast collection of poems, sayings, and [[aphorisms]] attributed to him continues to live on in oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;John Esposito, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'', Oxford University Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rajneesh|Osho]] mentions him as "an Egyptian Sufi mystic, one of the greatest who has ever walked on the earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Journey to the Heart |last=Osho |publisher=Rebel Publishing House, India |isbn=3-89338-141-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In the book catching the thread mentions one of the incidents of Dhul-nun ... ."A story from the life of the
ninth-century Sufi, Dhu-l-Nun, the Egyptian, illustrates
this:
I was wandering in the mountains when I
observed a party of afflicted folk gathered together.
“What befell you?” I asked.
“There is a devotee living in a cell here,” they
answered. “Once every year he comes out and
breathes on these people and they are all
healed. Then he returns to his cell, and does not
emerge again until the following year.”
I waited patiently until he came out. I beheld
a man pale of cheek, wasted and with sunken
eyes. The awe of him caused me to tremble. He
looked on the multitude with compassion. Then
he raised his eyes to heaven, and breathed
several times over the afflicted ones. All were
healed.
As he was about to retire to his cell, I seized
his skirt. “For the love of God,” I cried. “You
have healed the outward sickness; pray heal the
inward sickness.”
“Dhu-l-Nun,” he said, gazing at me, “take
your hand off me. The Friend is watching from
the zenith of might and majesty. If He sees you
clutching at another than He, He will abandon
you to that person, and that person to you, and
you will perish each at the other’s hand.”
So saying, he withdrew into his cell.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1312">'''Duinefontein''' 1 and 2 are early prehistoric [[archaeological site]]s near [[Cape Town]] in [[South Africa]]

They have produced [[Acheulean]] stone tools and animal bones dating between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago. It was not a settlement site, but instead seems to have been a waterside location where animals could be hunted or scavenged when they died by hominids. The hominids used the tools to butcher the animals, although many of the animal bones from the site represent killings by other carnivores.

One [[archaeological context|context]], from Duinefontein 2, dated by [[optically stimulated luminescence dating]] to 270,000 BP contained [[ochre]] that must have been introduced to the site by people and which may have been used as body adornment. If so, it would represent some of the earliest evidence of an aesthetic sensibility in early peoples.

'''Eduardo Luis Pareyón Moreno''' (December 2, 1921 &amp;ndash; March 15, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=nb2003-96610|accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Architecture|architect]] and [[Archaeology|archaeologist]]. He was a pioneer researcher in several aspects of modern Mexican archaeology. He was born (and died) in [[Azcapotzalco]], [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]], to a family renowned for its contributions to the [[humanities]] and [[sciences]].

==Education==
He studied architecture at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|National University]] and started a brilliant career assisting architect [[Mario Pani]] during projects as the new [[National Conservatory of Music (Mexico)|National Conservatory]] and the [[Latinoamericana Tower]], both in Mexico City. However, he soon get interested with archaeologic excavations, due to the rich history of the soil in many areas where he was working as architect. Another element that influenced his first studies as archaeologist, was that during his childhood he spent many days exploring the old ruins of [[Teotihuacan]], years before its reconstruction. Actually, Pareyón Moreno's father, colonel Eduardo Pareyón Azpeitia, was a friend of [[Manuel Gamio]], whose work and personality had an impact during his first cultural development.

He returned to study at the National School of Anthropology, where he completed his master dissertation "Excavations at the archaeologic zone of Cerro del Tepalcate" (1961).

==Career==
From 1955 to 1959 was assistant of [[Alfonso Caso]] during excavation and register works in archaeological sites in Quiotepec, Tecomavaca, Los Cues, and Cuicatlán, [[Oaxaca]].

In 1959 was named director of the Museum of Popular Arts at [[Pátzcuaro]], [[Michoacán]].

Around 1960 Pareyon was exploring and mapping archaeological sites in the low basin of the [[Balsas River]], at El [[Infiernillo Dam]]. In 1961-62 he conducted the reconstruction of the [[Tenayuca]] pyramid superposition 6, and was exploring [[Huejotla]], [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Texcoco]] archaeological site. In 1964 the [[INAH]] assigns him the whole reconstruction of Santa Cecilia Acatitla ruins, [[Estado de México]].

In 1970 he was named Chief of Archaeological Sites Maintenance of INAH. During the same year he moved to [[Palenque]], with the task of developing the studies on the unknown surroundings of the site. In 1972 he conducted consolidation works at [[Tulum]] ruins, and in 1973 he developed the project for the Archaeological Museum of [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya]], Estado de México. During 1975 was in charge of developing excavations and reconstructive tasks in Calixtlahuaca, and later in Tepetlaoztoc (1978), and in Ex-Convent of Churubusco (1980–81).

==Achievements==
His most important contributions to Mexican archaeology were the recovering of the ruins of [[Santa Cecilia Acatitlan]] and the studies about the '''yacatas''' structures in the [[Michoacán]] area of [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]]. He also initiated the archaeological works showing the [[mural]] paintings of the [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]] pyramid in [[Puebla]].

He taught history of [[Mexican art]] and architecture during 35 years, at the National School of Anthropology and the National Academy of San Carlos, in Mexico City.

He was accepted to the Membership of the Society for American Archaeology, 1962.[2]

'''Edward Kynaston''' (c. 1640 – January 1706) was an [[England|English]] [[actor]], one of the last [[Restoration theatre|Restoration]] "[[boy player]]s", young male actors who played women's roles.

==Career==
Kynaston was good looking and made a convincing woman: [[Samuel Pepys]] called him "the loveliest lady that ever I saw in my life" after seeing him in a production of [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Loyal Subject]]'' at the [[Cockpit-in-Court]], "only her voice [is] not very good". He also played the title role in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicoene]]''. Pepys had dinner with Kynaston after this production on 18 August 1660.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1660/08/18/index.php The Diary of Samuel Pepys], Saturday 18 August 1660.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously, Kynaston played male roles as well. He filled the role of Otto in ''[[Rollo Duke of Normandy]]'' on 6 December 1660, having played the female role of Arthiope in the same play in previous weeks. On 7 January 1661, Kynaston played three roles in a performance of [[Ben Jonson|Jonson's]] ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicoene]]'', one female and two male.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Elizabeth. ''The First English Actresses: Women and Drama, 1660&amp;ndash;1700''.   Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1992; p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of Kynaston's appeal may have been his ambiguous [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. The actor [[Colley Cibber]] recalled: "the Ladies of Quality prided themselves in taking him with them in their Coaches to [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde-Park]] in his Theatrical Habit, after the Play."&lt;ref&gt;Colley Cibber, ''An Apology for the Life of Colley Cibber, With an Historical View of the Stage During His own Time: Written by Himself'', Byrne R. S. Fone, ed., Mineola, NY, Courier Dover, 2000; p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cibber also reported that a performance of a tragedy attended by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was once delayed because, as someone explained, Kynaston, who was playing the Queen, "was not shav'd".&lt;ref&gt;Cibber, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1660s women were permitted to appear on stage and male actors playing female roles in serious drama was strongly discouraged. Kynaston's last female role was as Evadne in [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher's]] ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]'' with [[Thomas Killigrew]]'s [[King's Company]] in 1661. 

Described by [[Samuel Pepys]] as "the prettiest woman in the whole house" and "the handsomest man", the rumor of the time had him playing female roles off stage as well. When already in his thirties, lampoons circulated that made him out to be the lover of [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Matt Cook, ''A gay history of Britain: love and sex between men since the Middle Ages'' - P. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kynaston went on to make a successful career in male roles and was noted for his portrayal of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Henriad|''Henry IV'']]. He retired in 1699.

==Fictional portrayals==
Kynaston is played by [[Billy Crudup]] in the 2004 film ''[[Stage Beauty]]'' directed by Sir [[Richard Eyre]]. He is represented as a [[fop]]pish [[bisexual]], who slowly reveals more complexity in his personality and sexuality. The film is an adaptation of the play ''Compleat Female Stage Beauty'' by [[Jeffrey Hatcher]].  In 2012, the [[Houston Grand Opera]] announced a new opera by [[Carlisle Floyd]], with the actor as protagonist, is to be premiered in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Houston Press, 18 Feb 2016| http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/hgo-premieres-prince-of-players-when-men-could-no-longer-play-women-on-stage-8171377 &lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared as a character in ''[[Nell Gwynn (play)|Nell Gwynn]]'', played by [[Greg Haiste]] in the premiere production in 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2153">[[Image:Girolamo mei letter.jpg|right|thumb|Letter of Girolamo Mei to [[Vincenzo Galilei]], describing the effect of ancient Greek music on human emotions]]

'''Girolamo Mei''' (27 May 1519 – July 1594) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[historian]] and [[Humanism|humanist]], famous in music history for providing the intellectual impetus to the [[Florentine Camerata]], which attempted to revive ancient Greek music drama. He was born [[Florence]], and died in [[Rome]]. He also used the pseudonym '''Decimo Corinella da Peretola'''.&lt;ref&gt;Palisca, "Girolamo Mei."&lt;/ref&gt;

Mei was the first European after [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] to do a detailed study of ancient Greek music theory. He compiled his findings in a major treatise, ''De modis musicis antiquorum'' (not formally published, but written 1568 to 1573). Many of his findings he communicated to [[Vincenzo Galilei]] through an extensive correspondence; this information was decisive in the formation of the new musical style which was developing in Florence at the end of the 16th century, the new recitative style (''stile recitativo'') from which developed [[monody]], the first [[music drama]]s, and eventually [[opera]]. Galilei and the others in the Florentine Camerata were determined to revive the musical style of ancient Greek drama, and while they may have been mistaken, ultimately, in how it was actually performed, they began, using ideas from Mei, one of the greatest revolutions in music history.

Mei also edited and annotated the tragedies of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Euripides]], as well as many other works by classical writers.

[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|''Birthday Book Printing'', the fourth of the six [[Walk of Ideas]] sculptures displayed in [[Berlin]] during 2006, represents a pile of modern [[codex]] books.]]

The '''history of books''' starts with the [[History of writing|development of writing]], and various other inventions such as [[paper]] and [[printing]], and continues through to the modern day business of [[book printing]]. The earliest history of books actually predates what would conventionally be called "books" today and begins with tablets, scrolls, and sheets of [[papyrus]]. Then hand-bound, expensive, and elaborate books known as [[codices]] appeared. These gave way to [[printing press|press-printed]] volumes and eventually lead to the mass printed tomes prevalent today. Contemporary books may even have no physical presence with the advent of the [[e-book]]. The book also became more accessible to the disabled with the advent of [[Braille]] and spoken books.

== Clay tablets ==
[[File:Tablet describing goddess Inanna's battle with the mountain Ebih, Sumerian - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC07117.JPG|thumb|[[Sumer]]ian [[clay tablet]], currently housed in the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] at the [[University of Chicago]], inscribed with the text of the poem ''[[Inanna#Justice myths|Inanna and Ebih]]'' by the priestess [[Enheduanna]], the first author whose name is known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberta Binkley|title=Rhetoric before and beyond the Greeks|year=2004|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791460993|pages=47|chapter=Reading the Ancient Figure of Enheduanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Clay tablets were used in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 3rd millennium BC. The calamus, an instrument in the form of a triangle, was used to make characters in moist clay. People used to use fire to dry the tablets out. At [[Nineveh]], over 20,000 tablets were found, dating from the 7th century BC; this was the archive and library of the kings of [[Assyria]], who had workshops of copyists and conservationists at their disposal. This presupposes a degree of organization with respect to books, consideration given to conservation, classification, etc. Tablets were used right up until the 19th century in various parts of the world, including Germany, Chile, Philippines and the Saharan Desert.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/educator/modules/gutenberg/books/early/|title=Early Writing|website=www.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuneiform and Sumerian Writing ===
Writing originated as a form of record keeping in Sumer during the fourth millennium BCE with the advent of cuneiform. Many clay tablets have been found that show cuneiform writing used to record legal contracts, create lists of assets, and eventually to record Sumerian literature and myths. Scribal schools have been found by archaeologists from as early as the second millennium BCE where students were taught the art of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Papyrus ==
{{Main|Papyrus}}
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian Papyrus]]

After extracting the marrow from the stems of '''Papyrus reed''', a series of steps (humidification, pressing, drying, gluing, and cutting) produced media of variable quality, the best being used for sacred writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/papyrology-collection/how-ancient-papyrus-was-made|title=How Ancient Papyrus Was Made {{!}} U-M Library|website=www.lib.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Egypt]], papyrus was used as a medium for writing surfaces, maybe as early as from [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], but first evidence is from the account books of King [[Neferirkare Kakai]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty]] (about 2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books. The Book Arts from Antiquity to the Renaissance''. American Library Association / The British Library 1991, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; A calamus, the stem of a reed sharpened to a point, or bird feathers were used for writing. The script of Egyptian [[scribes]] was called [[hieratic]], or sacerdotal writing; it is not [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]], but a simplified form more adapted to manuscript writing (hieroglyphs usually being engraved or painted). Egyptians exported papyrus to other Mediterranean civilizations including Greece and Rome where it was used until parchment was developed.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papyrus]] books were in the form of a [[scroll]] of several sheets pasted together, for a total length of 10 meters or more.  Some books, such as the history of the reign of [[Ramses III]], were over 40 meters long. Books rolled out horizontally; the text occupied one side, and was divided into columns. The title was indicated by a label attached to the cylinder containing the book. Many papyrus texts come from tombs, where prayers and sacred texts were deposited (such as the [[Book of the Dead]], from the early 2nd millennium BC).

== East Asia ==
[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|upright|A Chinese bamboo book]]

Before the introduction of books, writing on [[Oracle bone|bone]], shells, [[Bamboo and wooden slips|wood]] and [[silk]] was prevalent in [[China]] long before the 2nd century BC, until [[paper]] was invented in China around the 1st century AD.

Because of the meticulous and time-consuming process that woodblock printing was, [[Bi Sheng]], a key contributor to the history of printing, invented the process of [[Movable type|movable type printing]] (1041-1048 AD).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/invention-woodblock-printing-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279|title=The Invention of Woodblock Printing in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|work=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Education|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/movableprt.shtml|title=The Invention of Movable Type|last=Lee|first=Silkroad Foundation, Adela C.Y.|website=www.silk-road.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bi Sheng developed a printing process in which written text could be copied with the use of formed character types, the earliest types being made of [[ceramic]] or clay material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The method of movable type printing would later become improved by [[Johannes Gutenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|title=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|website=www.historyguide.org|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-columbian codices of the Americas ==
[[File:Dresden codex, page 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dresden Codex]] (page 49)]]

In Mesoamerica, information was recorded on long strips of paper, agave fibers, or animal hides, which were then folded and protected by wooden covers.  These were thought to have existed since the time of the Classical Period between the 3rd and 8th centuries, CE.  Many of these codices were thought to contain astrological information, religious calendars, knowledge about the gods, genealogies of the rulers, cartographic information, and tribute collection.  Many of these codices were stored in temples but were ultimately destroyed by the Spanish explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Suarez, M.E. &amp; Wooudhuysen, H.R. (2013). The book: A global history. Oxford, Oxford University Press. Pages 656–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the only completely deciphered pre-Columbian writing system is the [[Maya script]].  The Maya, along with [[Mesoamerican writing systems|several]] other cultures in [[Mesoamerica]], constructed concertina-style books written on [[Amate]] paper. Nearly all Mayan texts were [[Diego de Landa|destroyed]] by the Spanish during colonization on cultural and religious grounds.  One of the few surviving examples is the [[Dresden Codex]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/pt/item/11621/ |title = O Códice de Dresden |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1200–1250 |accessdate = 2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although only the Maya have been shown to have a writing system capable of conveying any concept that can be conveyed via speech (at about the same level as the modern [[Japanese writing system]]), other [[Mesoamerican]] cultures had more rudimentary [[Ideogram|ideographical writing systems]] which were contained in similar concertina-style books, one such example being the [[Aztec codices]].

=== Florentine Codex ===
There are more than 2,000 illustrations drawn by native artists that represent this era. Bernardino de Sahagun tells the story of Aztec people’s lives and their natural history. The Florentine Codex speaks about the culture religious cosmology and ritual practices, society, economics, and natural history of the Aztec people. The manuscript are arranged in both the Nahuatl language and in Spanish. The English translation of the complete Nahuatl text of all twelve volumes of the Florentine Codex took ten years. Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble had a decade of long work but made it an important contribution to Mesoamerican ethnohistory. Years later, in 1979, the Mexican government published a full-color volume  of the Florentine Codex. Now, since 2012, it is available digitally and fully accessible to those interested in Mexican and Aztec History.

The Florentine Codex is a 16th century ethnographic research study brought about by the Spanish Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun. The codex itself was actually named ''La Historia Universal de las Cosas de Nueva España.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/516552.|title=Project MUSE|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernardino de Sahagun worked on this project from 1545 up until his death in 1590. The Florentine Codex consist of twelve books. It is 2400 pages long but divided into the twelve books by categories such as; The Gods, Ceremonies, Omens, and other cultural aspects of Aztec people.

== Wax tablets ==
[[File:Herkulaneischer Meister 002b.jpg|thumb|right|Woman holding wax tablets in the form of the [[codex]]. Wall painting from [[Pompeii]], before 79 AD.]]

Romans used wax-coated wooden tablets or ''pugillares'' upon which they could write and erase by using a [[stylus]]. One end of the stylus was pointed, and the other was spherical. Usually these tablets were used for everyday purposes (accounting, notes) and for teaching writing to children, according to the methods discussed by [[Quintilian]] in his ''Institutio Oratoria'' X Chapter 3. Several of these tablets could be assembled in a form similar to a [[codex]]. Also the etymology of the word codex (block of wood) suggest that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press 2003 [reprint], p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parchment ==
{{Main|Parchment}}

Parchment progressively replaced [[papyrus]].  Legend attributes its invention to [[Eumenes II]], the king of [[Pergamon]], from which comes the name "pergamineum," which became "parchment."  Its production began around the 3rd century BC.  Made using the skins of animals (sheep, cattle, donkey, antelope, etc.), parchment proved to be easier to conserve over time; it was more solid, and allowed one to erase text.  It was a very expensive medium because of the rarity of material and the time required to produce a document. [[Vellum]] is the finest quality of parchment.

=== Greece and Rome ===
The scroll of [[papyrus]] is called "volumen" in Latin, a word which signifies "circular movement," "roll," "spiral," "whirlpool," "revolution" (similar, perhaps, to the modern English interpretation of "swirl") and finally "a roll of writing paper, a rolled manuscript, or a book."
In the 7th century [[Isidore of Seville]] explains the relation between codex, book and scroll in his ''Etymologiae'' (VI.13) as this:
{{cquote|A codex is composed of many books (''librorum''); a book is of one scroll (''voluminis''). It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (''caudex'') of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches.}}

=== Description ===
The scroll is rolled around two vertical wooden axes.  This design allows only sequential usage; one is obliged to read the text in the order in which it is written, and it is impossible to place a marker in order to directly access a precise point in the text.  It is comparable to modern video cassettes.  Moreover, the reader must use both hands to hold on to the vertical wooden rolls and therefore cannot read and write at the same time.  The only volumen in common usage today is the Jewish [[Torah]].

=== Book culture ===
The authors of [[ancient history|Antiquity]] had no rights concerning their published works; there were neither authors' nor publishing rights.  Anyone could have a text recopied, and even alter its contents.  Scribes earned money and authors earned mostly glory, unless a patron provided cash; a book made its author famous.  This followed the traditional conception of the culture: an author stuck to several models, which he imitated and attempted to improve.  The status of the author was not regarded as absolutely personal.

From a political and religious point of view, books were censored very early: the works of [[Protagoras]] were burned because he was a proponent of [[agnosticism]] and argued that one could not know whether or not the gods existed. Generally, cultural conflicts led to important periods of book destruction: in 303, the emperor [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of Christian texts.  Some [[Christians]] later burned libraries, and especially heretical or non-canonical Christian texts.  These practices are found throughout human history but have ended in many nations today.  A few nations today still greatly censor and even burn books.

But there also exists a less visible but nonetheless effective form of censorship when books are reserved for the elite; the book was not originally a medium for expressive liberty.  It may serve to confirm the values of a political system, as during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]], who skillfully surrounded himself with great authors.  This is a good ancient example of the control of the media by a political power.  However, private and public censorship have continued into the modern era, albeit in various forms.

=== Proliferation and conservation of books in Greece ===
Little information concerning books in Ancient [[Greece]] survives.  Several vases (6th and 5th centuries BC) bear images of volumina.  There was undoubtedly no extensive trade in books, but there existed several sites devoted to the sale of books.

The spread of books, and attention to their cataloging and conservation, as well as literary criticism developed during the [[Hellenistic]] period with the creation of large libraries in response to the desire for knowledge exemplified by [[Aristotle]].  These libraries were undoubtedly also built as demonstrations of political prestige:
* The [[Library of Alexandria]], a library created by [[Ptolemy I|Ptolemy Soter]] and set up by [[Demetrius Phalereus]] (Demetrius of Phaleron). It contained 500,900 volumes (in the ''Museion'' section) and 40,000 at the Serapis temple (''Serapeion''). All books in the luggage of visitors to Egypt were inspected, and could be held for copying. The Museion was partially destroyed in 47 BC.
* The Library at [[Pergamon]], founded by [[Attalus I]]; it contained 200,000 volumes which were moved to the Serapeion by [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]], after the destruction of the Museion. The Serapeion was partially destroyed in 391, and the last books disappeared in 641 CE following the [[Arab]] conquest.
* The Library at [[Athens]], the ''Ptolemaion'', which gained importance following the destruction of the [[Library at Alexandria]] ; the [[Library of Pantainos]], around 100 CE; the library of [[Hadrian]], in 132 CE.
* The Library at [[Rhodes]], a library that rivaled the [[Library of Alexandria]].
* The Library at [[Antioch]], a public library of which [[Euphorion of Chalcis]] was the director near the end of the 3rd century.

The libraries had copyist workshops, and the general organisation of books allowed for the following:
* Conservation of an example of each text
* Translation (the [[Septuagint]] [[Bible]], for example)
* Literary criticisms in order to establish reference texts for the copy (example : ''[[The Iliad]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]'')
* A catalog of books
* The copy itself, which allowed books to be disseminated

=== Book production in Rome ===
Book production developed in [[Rome]] in the 1st century BC with Latin literature that had been influenced by the Greek. Conservative estimates places the number of potential readers in Imperial Rome at around 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Beard-t.html|title=Scrolling Down the Ages|last=Beard|first=Mary|date=April 16, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629200012/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Beard-t.html|archive-date=June 29, 2017|dead-url=|quote=Imperial Rome had a population of at least a million. Using a conservative estimate of literacy levels, there would have been more than 100,000 readers in the city.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This diffusion primarily concerned circles of literary individuals.  [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]] was the editor of his friend [[Cicero]].  However, the book business progressively extended itself through the [[Roman Empire]]; for example, there were bookstores in [[Lyon]].  The spread of the book was aided by the extension of the Empire, which implied the imposition of the [[Latin]] tongue on a great number of people (in Spain, Africa, etc.).

[[Library|Libraries]] were private or created at the behest of an individual. [[Julius Caesar]], for example, wanted to establish one in Rome, proving that libraries were signs of political prestige.

In the year 377, there were 28 libraries in Rome, and it is known that there were many smaller libraries in other cities. Despite the great distribution of books, scientists do not have a complete picture as to the literary scene in antiquity as thousands of books have been lost through time.

== Paper ==
{{Main|History of paper}}

Papermaking has traditionally been traced to China about AD 105, when [[Cai Lun]], an official attached to the Imperial court during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD), created a sheet of paper using [[mulberry]] and other [[bast fibre]]s along with [[fishnets]], old rags, and [[hemp]] waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While paper used for wrapping and padding was used in China since the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]], p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt;  paper used as a writing medium only became widespread by the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 1"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century in China, sheets of paper were beginning to be used for [[toilet paper]] as well.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]], p.&amp;nbsp;123&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 AD) paper was folded and sewn into square [[tea bag|bags]] to preserve the flavor of tea.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt; The [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) that followed was the first government to issue [[banknote|paper currency]].

An important development was the mechanization of paper manufacture by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] papermakers. The introduction of water-powered [[paper mill]]s, the first certain evidence of which dates to the 11th century in Córdoba, Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Robert I.: "Paper comes to the West, 800–1400", in: Lindgren, Uta: ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800 bis 1400.

Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of [[parchment]] and then falling further.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Robert I.: "Paper comes to the West, 800–1400", in: Lindgren, Uta: ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800 bis 1400.

== Middle Ages ==
{{Main|Manuscript culture|Illuminated manuscript}}
[[File:Codex Manesse Ulrich von Singenberg.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[codex Manesse]]'', a book from the Middle Ages]]

By the end of antiquity, between the 2nd and 4th centuries, the [[scroll]] was replaced by the [[codex]]. The book was no longer a continuous roll, but a collection of sheets attached at the back.  It became possible to access a precise point in the text quickly.  The codex is equally easy to rest on a table, which permits the reader to take notes while he or she is reading.  The codex form improved with the separation of words, capital letters, and punctuation, which permitted silent reading.  Tables of contents and indices facilitated direct access to information.  This form was so effective that it is still the standard book form, over 1500 years after its appearance.

Paper would progressively replace parchment.  Cheaper to produce, it allowed a greater diffusion of books.

=== Books in monasteries ===
A number of Christian books were destroyed at the order of [[Diocletian]] in 304 AD. During the turbulent periods of the invasions, it was the monasteries that conserved religious texts and certain works of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for the West.  But there would also be important copying centers in [[Byzantium]].

The role of monasteries in the conservation of books is not without some ambiguity:
* Reading was an important activity in the lives of monks, which can be divided into prayer, intellectual work, and manual labor (in the [[Benedictine]] order, for example).  It was therefore necessary to make copies of certain works.  Accordingly, there existed scriptoria (the plural of scriptorium) in many monasteries, where monks copied and decorated manuscripts that had been preserved.
* However, the conservation of books was not exclusively in order to preserve ancient culture; it was especially relevant to understanding religious texts with the aid of ancient knowledge.  Some works were never recopied, having been judged too dangerous for the monks.  Moreover, in need of blank media, the monks scraped off manuscripts, thereby destroying ancient works.  The transmission of knowledge was centered primarily on sacred texts.

=== Copying and conserving books ===
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|An author portrait of [[Jean Miélot]] writing his compilation of the ''Miracles of Our Lady'', one of his many popular works.]]

Despite this ambiguity, monasteries in the West and the Eastern Empire permitted the conservation of a certain number of secular texts, and several libraries were created: for example, [[Cassiodorus]] ('Vivarum' in Calabria, around 550), or [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] in [[Constantinople]].  There were several libraries, but the survival of books often depended on political battles and ideologies, which sometimes entailed massive destruction of books or difficulties in production (for example, the distribution of books during the [[Iconoclasm]] between 730 and 842).  A long list of very old and surviving libraries that now form part of the [[Vatican Archives]] can be found in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].

A very strong example of the early copying and conserving books is that of the [[Quran]]. After Muhammad, his companion Abu Bakr, on the recommendation of Umar Bin Alkhattab, assigned Zayd bin Saabit to compile the first official scripture of the Quran. Zayd collected all the available scriptures of the Quran scripted by different companions of Muhammad during his life. He compiled one scripture and got it verified by all the companions who had memorized the whole book while Muhammad was alive. Then this first official scripture was kept at the house of Hafsa, the wife of the Muhammad. By the time of the third caliph Uthmaan, the Islamic state had spread over a large portion of the known world. He ordered the preparation of the official copies of the first official scripture. The copies were duly verified for accuracy. These copies were sent to each city of the caliphate so that further copies can be made locally with the perfect accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quran#Compilation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To help preserve books and protect them from thieves, librarians would create [[Chained library|chained libraries]]. Chained Libraries were books displayed next to each other to create a tight bond. This eliminated unauthorised removal of books. One of the earliest chained libraries was in England during the 1500s. Popular culture also has examples of chained libraries, such as in [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]] by [[J.K Rowling]].

=== The ''scriptorium'' ===
The scriptorium was the workroom of monk copyists; here, books were copied, decorated, rebound, and conserved.  The armarius directed the work and played the role of librarian.

The role of the copyist was multifaceted: for example, thanks to their work, texts circulated from one monastery to another.  Copies also allowed monks to learn texts and to perfect their religious education.  The relationship with the book thus defined itself according to an intellectual relationship with [[God]].  But if these copies were sometimes made for the monks themselves, there were also copies made on demand.

The task of copying itself had several phases: the preparation of the manuscript in the form of notebooks once the work was complete, the presentation of pages, the copying itself, revision, correction of errors, decoration, and [[bookbinding|binding]].  The book therefore required a variety of competencies, which often made a manuscript a collective effort.

=== Transformation from the literary edition in the 12th century ===

[[File:Sandro Botticelli - The Virgin and Child (The Madonna of the Book) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|The scene in [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[Madonna of the Book]]'' (1480) reflects the presence of books in the houses of richer people in his time.]]
The revival of cities in Europe would change the conditions of book production and extend its influence, and the monastic period of the book would come to an end.  This revival accompanied the intellectual renaissance of the period. The [[Manuscript culture]] outside of the monastery developed in these university-cities in Europe in this time.  It is around the first universities that new structures of production developed: reference manuscripts were used by students and professors for teaching [[theology]] and liberal arts.  The development of commerce and of the bourgeoisie brought with it a demand for specialized and general texts (law, history, novels, etc.).  It is in this period that writing in the common vernacular developed (courtly poetry, novels, etc.).  Commercial scriptoria became common, and the profession of book seller came into being, sometimes dealing internationally.

There is also the creation of royal [[libraries]] as in the case of [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] and [[Charles V of France|Charles V]]. Books were also collected in private libraries, which became more common in the 14th and 15th centuries.

The use of paper diffused through Europe in the 14th century.  This material, less expensive than [[parchment]], came from China via the [[Arabs]] in Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries. It was used in particular for ordinary copies, while [[parchment]] was used for luxury editions.

== Printing press ==
{{Main|Printing press}}

The invention of the moveable type on the [[printing press]] by Johann Fust, Peter Schoffer and [[Johannes Gutenberg]] around 1440 marks the entry of the book into the industrial age.  The Western book was no longer a single object, written or reproduced by request.  The publication of a book became an enterprise, requiring capital for its realization and a market for its distribution. The cost of each individual book (in a large edition) was lowered enormously, which in turn increased the distribution of books.  The book in codex form and printed on paper, as we know it today, dates from the 15th century. Books printed before January 1, 1501, are called [[incunable]]s. The spreading of book printing all over Europe occurred relatively quickly, but most books were still printed in [[Latin]]. The spreading of the concept of printing books in the [[vernacular]] was a somewhat slower process.

== Contemporary era ==
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] more books began to pour off European presses, creating an early form of information overload for many readers.  Nowhere was this more the case than in Enlightenment Scotland, where students were exposed to a wide variety of books during their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership|journal=The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland|year=2012|volume=2|pages=297–309|url=https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The demands of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (founded 1804), the [[American Bible Society]] (founded 1816), and other non-denominational publishers for enormously large inexpensive runs of texts led to numerous innovations. The introduction of steam printing presses a little before 1820, closely followed by new steam paper mills, constituted the two most major innovations.  Together, they caused book prices to drop and the number of books to increase considerably.  Numerous bibliographic features, like the positioning and formulation of titles and subtitles, were also affected by this new production method.  New types of documents appeared later in the 19th century:  [[photography]], [[sound recording]] and [[film]].

[[Typewriter]]s and eventually computer based word processors and printers let people print and put together their own documents. [[Desktop publishing]] is common in the 21st century.

Among a series of developments that occurred in the 1990s, the spread of digital multimedia, which encodes texts, images, animations, and sounds in a unique and simple form was notable for the book publishing industry. [[Hypertext]] further improved access to information. Finally, the [[internet]] lowered production and distribution costs.

=== E-books and the future of the book ===
It is difficult to predict the future of the book in an era of fast-paced technological change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Darnton]], ''The Case for Books: Past, Present and Future'', New York, Public Affairs, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-58648-826-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anxieties about the "death of books" have been expressed throughout the history of the medium, perceived as threatened by competing media such as radio, television, and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8xg8EfQnnAC|title=The Future of the Book|last=Nunberg|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpNtvB4YF2cC|title=This is Not the End of the Book: A Conversation Curated by Jean-Philippe de Tonnac|last=Carrière|first=Jean-Claude|last2=Eco|first2=Umberto|date=2012-05-01|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-955245-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these views are generally exaggerated, and "dominated by fetishism, fears about the end of humanism and ideas of techno-fundamentalist progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballatore|first=Andrea|last2=Natale|first2=Simone|date=2015-05-18|title=E-readers and the death of the book: Or, new media and the myth of the disappearing medium|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/05/18/1461444815586984|journal=New Media &amp; Society|pages=1461444815586984|doi=10.1177/1461444815586984|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The print book medium has proven to be very resilient and adaptable.

A good deal of reference material, designed for direct access instead of sequential reading, as for example [[encyclopedia]]s, exists less and less in the form of books and increasingly on the web. Leisure reading materials are increasingly published in e-reader formats.

Although electronic books, or e-books, had limited success in the early years, and readers were resistant at the outset, the demand for books in this format has grown dramatically, primarily because of the popularity of e-reader devices and as the number of available titles in this format has increased. Since the [[Amazon Kindle]] was released in 2007, the e-book has become a digital phenomenon and many theorize that it will take over hardback and paper books in future. E-books are much more accessible and easier to buy and it’s also cheaper to purchase an E-Book rather than its physical counterpart due to paper expenses being deducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teenink.com/opinion/current_events_politics/article/211256/Are-E-books-Taking-Over-the-Printed-World/|title=Are E-books Taking Over the Printed World? – Teen Politics Essay|website=www.teenink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another important factor in the increasing popularity of the e-reader is its continuous diversification. Many e-readers now support basic operating systems, which facilitate email and other simple functions. The [[iPad]] is the most obvious example of this trend, but even mobile phones can host e-reading software.

== Reading for the blind ==
[[Braille]] is a system of reading and writing through the use of the finger tips. Braille was developed as a system of efficient communication for blind and partially blind alike.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://brailleworks.com/braille-resources/history-of-braille/|title=History of Braille - Braille Works|work=Braille Works|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system consists of sixty-three characters and is read left to right. These characters are made with small raised dots in two columns similar to a modern [[Dominoes|domino piece]] to represent each letter.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Braille-writing-system|title=Braille {{!}} writing system|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers can identify characters with two fingers. Reading speed averages one hundred and twenty-five words per minute and can reach two hundred words per minute.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== The making of Braille ===
Braille was named after its creator [[Louis Braille]] in 1824 in [[France]]. Braille stabbed himself in the eyes at the age of three with his father's leather working tools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Braille spent nine years working on a previous system of communication called [[night writing]] by [[Charles Barbier]]. Braille published his book "procedure for writing words, music, and plainsong in dots", in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nfb.org/1829-braille-book|title=1829 Braille Book|date=2010-10-04|work=National Federation of the Blind|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 France made Braille the "official communication system for blind individuals".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[Valentin Haüy]] was the first person to put Braille on paper in the form of a book.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1932 Braille became accepted and used in English speaking countries.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1965 the Nemeth Code of Braille Mathematics and Scientific Notation was created. The code was developed to assign symbols to advanced mathematical notations and operations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The system has remained the same, only minor adjustments have been made to it since its creation.

=== Spoken books ===
The spoken book was originally created in the 1930s to provide the blind and visually impaired with a medium to enjoy books. In 1932 the [[American Foundation for the Blind]] created the first recordings of spoken books on vinyl records.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silksoundbooks.com/history-of-audiobooks.html|title=The History of the audiobooks|last=Silksoundbooks|website=www.silksoundbooks.com|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, a British based foundation, [[Royal National Institute of Blind People|Royal National Institute for the Blind]] (RNIB), was the first to deliver talking books to the blind on vinyl records.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each record contained about thirty minutes of audio on both sides, and the records were played on a [[Phonograph|gramophone]]. Spoken books changed mediums in the 1960s with the transition from vinyl records to cassette tapes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/a-short-history-of-the-audiobook-20-years-after-the-first-portable-digital-audio-device|title=A short history of the audiobook, 20 years after the first portable digital audio device|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next progression of spoken books came in the 1980s with the widespread use of compact discs. Compact discs reached more people and made it possible to listen to books in the car.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1995 the term [[audiobook]] became the industry standard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, the internet enabled audiobooks to become more accessible and portable. Audiobooks could now be played in their entirety instead of being split onto multiple disks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Academic discipline==

[[File:Bucheinband.15.Jh.r.Inkunabel.jpg|thumb|right|A 15th-century [[Incunable]]. Notice the blind-tooled cover, corner bosses and clasps.]]
The history of the book as an [[academic discipline]] studies the production, transmission, circulation and dissemination of text from [[Ancient history|antiquity]] to the present day. Its scope includes the book as object, the [[history of ideas]], [[history of religion]], [[bibliography]], [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]], [[archiving|curation]] and the future of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sites.hps.cam.ac.uk/research/hb.html Johns, A. (1998) Research Guide: The History of the Book. Department of History and Philosophy of Science. University of Cambridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
The history of the book came into existence in the latter half of the 20th century. It was fostered by [[William Ivins Jr.]]'s ''Prints and Visual Communication'' (1953) and [[Henri-Jean Martin]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]'s ''L'apparition du livre'' (''The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing, 1450–1800'') in 1958 as well as [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s ''Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man'' (1962).  Another notable pioneer in the History of the Book is [[Robert Darnton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=I.R.Willison|url=http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/8/1/July.pdf|title=The History of the Book as a Field of Study within the Humanities|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Janet Lippman Abu-Lughod''' (August 3, 1928 – December 14, 2013) was an American [[sociologist]] with major contributions to [[World-systems theory]] and [[Urban sociology]].&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=janet-l-abu-lughod&amp;pid=168644942|title=JANET L.

==Family==
She was married in 1951–1991 to [[Ibrahim Abu-Lughod]]. They had four children; [[Lila Abu-Lughod|Lila]], Mariam, Deena, and Jawad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Edward Said]]|url= https://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,505473,00.html Ibrahim Abu-Lughod|title= ''The Guardian''(obituary)|date= June 12, 2001|accessdate=2009-08-31|quote=Said 2001 misspells Deena's name as "Dina"; it is correctly spelled in Pace 2001.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
While still at high school she was influenced by the works of [[Lewis Mumford]] about urbanization.&lt;ref name="Mum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albany.edu/mumford/About_us/Abu_lecture.pdf |title=First Annual Lewis Mumford Lecture |date=2000-04-12 |accessdate=2009-08-31 |quote=When I was still in high school, there were four books I read that left a life-shaping effect on everything I have since thought about cities. Two of those -- Technics and Civilization (first published in 1934), and The Culture of Cities (first published in 1938) -- were written by Lewis Mumford. They made an urbanist out of me, and I was not alone. Single-handedly, Mumford's writings placed cities on the agenda of ordinary Americans. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815142814/http://www.albany.edu/mumford/About_us/Abu_lecture.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|left|The 13th century world-system. Map based on Janet Abu-Lughod's work.]]
Janet Abu-Lughod held graduate degrees from the [[University of Chicago]] and [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. Her teaching career began at the [[University of Illinois]], took her to the [[American University in Cairo]], [[Smith College]], and [[Northwestern University]], where she taught for twenty years and directed several urban studies programmes. In 1987 she accepted a professorship in sociology and historical studies at the Graduate Faculty of the [[New School for Social Research]], from which she retired as professor emerita in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getcited.org/mbrx/PT/2/MBR/11058404 |title=Getcited - Janet Abu-Lughot |accessdate=2009-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217110600/http://www.getcited.org/mbrx/PT/2/MBR/11058404 |archivedate=2009-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She published over a hundred articles and thirteen books dealing with urban sociology, the history and dynamics of the World System, and Middle Eastern cities, including an urban history of [[Cairo]] that is still considered one of the classic works on that city: ''Cairo: 1001 Years of the City Victorious''.

In 1976 she was awarded a John Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship for Sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/33-janet-l-abu-lughod |title=Guggenheim Fellowships |accessdate=2009-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211022258/http://gf.org/fellows/33-Janet-L-Abu-Lughod |archivedate=2009-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was especially famous for her monograph ''[[Before European Hegemony: The World System A.D. 1250-1350]]''  where she argued that a pre-modern world system extending across Eurasia existed in the 13th Century, prior to the formation of the modern world-system identified by [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]. In addition, she argued that the "rise of the West," beginning with the intrusion of armed Portuguese ships into the relatively peaceful trade networks of the Indian Ocean in the 16th century, was not a result of features internal to Europe, but was made possible by a collapse in the previous world system.

She published several well-received works on American cities including  ''New York, Chicago, Los Angeles: America's Global Cities'' and ''Race, Space, and Riots in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles''.

She died aged 85 in New York City on December 14, 2013.&lt;ref name="legacy"/&gt;

'''Johannes Lucius''' ({{lang-hr|Ivan Lucić}}; {{lang-it|Giovanni Lucio}}; September, 1604&amp;nbsp;– January 11, 1679) was a [[Dalmatia]]n historian, whose greatest work is ''De regno Dalmatiae et Croatiae'' ("On the Kingdom of Dalmatia and Croatia"), which includes valuable historical sources, a bibliography and six historical [[map]]s.

Born in September 1640 in [[Trogir]] in a noble family, Lucius studied in Trogir and Rome, graduating philosophy, mathematics, political sciences and literature in 1628, and receiving Ph.D. in civil and canonical law in 1630. Following graduation, he worked as councilmen and judge in his hometown and developed intensive scientific-research work. His first book ''Vita B. Ioannis confessoris episcopi Traguriensis et eius miracula'' [Life of St. John the Confessor, Bishop of Trogir] (1657) is an important source of Croatian, and especially Dalmatian, history between 11th and 13th centuries. His capital work is ''De regno Dalmatiae et Croatiae'' [On the Kingdom of Dalmatia and Croatia] (1662) in which he described the history of Dalmatia between the Roman times and 1480. The book contains the genealogy of Croatian dukes and kings and six historical Illyrian maps, regarded in Croatia as "the first Croatian atlas". The best known is map no. 6, ''Illyricum hodiernum'' [Present-day Illyricum], which Lucius dedicated to the Croatian ban [[Petar Zrinski]], later included in Blaeu's [[Atlas Maior]]. In the book ''Memorie istoriche di Tragurio ora detto Traù'' [Historical testimonies about Trogir, now called Traù], he described the history of Trogir and Dalmatia to the mid 15th century. His book ''Inscriptiones Dalmaticae'' [Dalmatian Inscriptions] (1673) contains inscriptions and epigraphic monuments from Dalmatian heritage. In addition to his many other historical works, Lucius also engaged in archeology, geography, mathematics, physics, astronomy, construction and studying of ancient Christian monuments, Roman mosaics and inscriptions.

He was a member of the [[Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome]] in whose catacombs he was buried after his death in January 1679. Today, Lucius is widely regarded in Croatia as "the father of modern Croatian historiography".

== Life and works ==
[[File:Trogir Skyline.JPG|thumb|220px|[[Trogir]], birthplace of Johannes Lucius]]
Johannes was the son of Peter Lucius and Clara Difnico (Klara Divnić),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | last = Stoy  | first = Manfred  | editor-last = Mathias Bernath, Felix von Schroeder  | editor-first =   | encyclopedia = Biographisches Lexikon zur Geschichte Südosteuropas  | title = Lucius, Ivan  | url = http://www.biolex.ios-regensburg.de/BioLexViewview.php?ID=1265  | year = 1979  | publisher = Oldenbourg Verlag  | location = München  | isbn = 978-3-486-48991-0  | pages = 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; born in [[Trogir]], [[Venetian Dalmatia]] (now [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref name="Wolff2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Larry Wolff|title=Venice and the Slavs: The Discovery of Dalmatia in the Age of Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2LFRiT1nfYC&amp;pg=PA47|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-3946-7|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some schooling in his hometown, he went to [[Rome]], where he spent two years, and then obtained his Ph.D. in ecclesiastical and civil law in the [[University of Padua]]. He returned to Trogir, and held various offices, but he returned to Rome in 1654. There he became a member of the [[Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome|Fraternity of Saint Jerome]], and then its president. He participated in the work of many scientific academies of his age and wrote to scientists from Dalmatia, [[Italy]] and [[Europe]].

He wrote a number of historical works in Italian and Latin. His greatest and most famous work is ''De regno Dalmatiae et Croatiae'' (''The Kingdom of Dalmatia and Croatia'').&lt;ref name="Boyd1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBqWbDmFsfEC&amp;pg=PA70|date=January 1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-884964-33-6|pages=70–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published after the [[siege of Candia|war of Candia]], a critical moment for the Republic of Venice. In his book Lucius pointed out the difference between the [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] Dalmatia, the habits of the people and the cultural borderlines.

It was first printed in [[Amsterdam]] in 1666. This book provides an overview of both, the [[history of Dalmatia]] and [[history of Croatia]], from the [[prehistory]] to the 15th century. While his predecessors and contemporaries used suppositions as much as facts, Lucius founded his estimates on genuine sources. At the end of the book, he included certain valuable historical sources and a bibliography with his comments. The book had six historical [[map]]s. One of maps, the historical map ''[[Illyricum hodiernum]]'' (today's ''[[Illyria]]'') was dedicated by [[Joan Blaeu]], Lucius' publisher to the Croatian [[Ban (title)|ban]] [[Petar Zrinski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of Illyria|url=http://museum.hismus.hr/p0248003.htm|work=museum.hismus.hr/|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since everyone was looking up to antiquity, the Zrinski believed their ancestors were Roman aristocrats. Lucius showed them that their roots reached back to the famous medieval dukes of [[House of Šubić|Šubićs]] noble family from [[Bribir (Dalmatia)|Bribir]].

Lucius participated in the dispute about the authenticity of the text of ''[[Trimalchio]]'s Banquet'' by the Roman [[satire|satirist]] [[Petronius]], which had been found in Trogir.

He also published the history of his home town in ''[[Memoriae istoriche di Tragurio, ora detto Trau]]'' ("Trogir in Historical Literature"; 1673). He also published a book of Roman inscriptions from Dalmatia, including the inscriptions collected by the famous Croatian poet and writer [[Marko Marulić]]. Shortly before his death, Lucius prepared the [[Statute]] of Trogir for printing.

Lucius was never married. He resided in Rome until his death, and was buried there, in the [[Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome|Church of St. Jerome]]. A monument was erected to his memory in 1740.

== Significance ==
Johannes Lucius was the first Dalmatian historian who critically examined and used historical sources: documents and chronicles, inscriptions and last wills. His historical [[methodology]] was far ahead of his time.

He corresponded with many famous people from [[Republic of Ragusa|Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik)]], especially [[Stefano Gradi]], the head of the [[Vatican Library]]. His numerous letters, revealing him as a man of integrity and a skilful writer are a valuable fresco of the conditions of his time.

Lucius' work, written in a [[lapidary]] and clear style, based on critical considerations, is the cornerstone of the modern [[historiography]] about Dalmatia.&lt;ref&gt;On. G. Toth, [http://www.arcipelagoadriatico.it/saggi/dalmazia/dati/saggi&amp;contributi_Dalmazia_StoriaDalmazia_Toth3.pdf Dalmatian history: the Venetian time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719234523/http://www.arcipelagoadriatico.it/saggi/dalmazia/dati/saggi%26contributi_Dalmazia_StoriaDalmazia_Toth3.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today in Croatia, Lucius is considered the father of modern contemporary Croatian historiography.

== Works ==
The following are his principal published works:
*''[http://dk.nsk.hr/stara_knjiga/NSK_SK_ID15/ De Regno Dalmatiae et Croatiae libri sex]'' (6 vols., Venice, 1673);

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10727">In [[Japanese mythology]], the {{nihongo|creation of Japan|国産み|'''Kuniumi'''|literally "birth or formation of the country"}} is the traditional and legendary history of the emergence of the [[Japanese archipelago]], of islands, as narrated in the [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]]. According to this legend, after the creation of Heaven and Earth, the [[kami|gods]] [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] were given the task of forming a series of islands that would become what is now Japan. In Japanese mythology these islands make up the known world. The creation of Japan is followed by the creation of the gods (''[[kamiumi]]'')







==Creation story==
[[File:Kobayashi Izanami and Izanagi.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Izanagi]] (right) and [[Izanami]] (left) consolidating the earth with the spear Ama-no-Nuboko. Painting by Eitaku Kobayashi ([[Meiji period]])]]

===According to the Kojiki===
After the formation, the Heaven was above and Earth was still a drifting soft mush. The first five gods named {{nihongo|''[[Kotoamatsukami]]''|別天津神||"Separate Heavenly Deities"}} were lone deities without gender&lt;ref name=gakken/&gt; and did not procreate. Then came the {{nihongo|''[[Kamiyonanayo]]''|神世七代||"The Seven Divine Generations"}}, consisting of two lone deities followed by five couples.  It was the last couple, Izanagi and Izanami that gave earth its solid form and first procreated other gods.

The elder gods delegated the youngest couple Izanagi and Izanami to carry out their venerable mandate: to reach down from heaven and give solid form to the earth. This they did with the use of a precious stone-covered spear named {{Nihongo|[[Amenonuhoko|Ame-no-nuboko]]|天沼矛||"heavenly jewelled spear"}}, given to them by the elders. Standing over the {{nihongo|Ame-no-ukihashi|天浮橋||"floating bridge of heaven"}}, they churned the chaotic mass with the spear. When drops of salty water fell from the tip, they formed into the first island, [[Onogoroshima]]. In forming this island, both gods came down from heaven, and spontaneously built a central support column &lt;ref&gt;Takeda {{Harv|武田|1996|p=22 n6|quote=家屋の中心となる神聖な柱を立てた。}}&lt;/ref&gt; called the {{Nihongo|Ame-no-mihashira|天御柱||"heavenly pillar"}} which upheld the "hall measuring eight [[fathoms]]" that the gods caused to appear afterwards.&lt;ref name=gakken&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=小向|first=正司|publisher=学研|year=1992|title=神道の本|series=Books Esoterica|volume=2|isbn=|page=27}}(zasshi code 66951-07; kyōtsu zasshi code T10-66951-07-1000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kojiki-p73"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kojiki-p74"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=takeda&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author-link=:ja:武田祐吉|last=武田|first=祐吉 (Yūkichi Takeda)|editor=中村啓信|title=新訂古事記|publisher=講談社|origyear=1977|year=1996|isbn=4-04-400101-4|pages=21–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then they initiated conversation inquiring of each other's bodily [[anatomy]], leading to a mutual decision to mate and procreate:&lt;ref name="kojiki-p74"/&gt;

What say you to this?&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;「吾身亦層層鑄也 尚有凸餘處一 故以此吾身之餘處 刺塞汝身之未成處 為完美態而生國土 奈何」 (in Old Japanese); 「私の体には、成長して、成長し過ぎたところが1ヶ所あります。そこで、この私の成長し過ぎたところで、あなたの成長していないところを刺して塞いで、国土を生みたいと思います。生むのはどうですか。」 (transcription in modern Japanese). ''[[Kojiki]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Izanami accepted the offer and Izanagi proposed that both should circle around the column ''Ame-no-mihashira'' in opposite directions, Izanami going right and Izanagi left and on meeting each other would perform sexual intercourse ({{nihongo|''maguwai''|[[:ja:まぐわい|麻具波比]]}}). However, when they met on the other side of the pillar, Izanami was the first to speak, saying: "Oh, indeed you are beautiful and kind youth!", to which Izanagi replied: "Oh, what a most beautiful and kind youth!". Izanagi then rebukes Izanami saying: "It is wrong for the wife to speak first.".&lt;ref name="kojiki-p74"/&gt;

However they mated anyway and later fathered a child [[Hiruko]] (lit. "leech child), who was placed in a reed boat dragged by the current.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Later popular legends say he became the Japanese god [[Ebisu (mythology)|Ebisu]]. It does not say so in the ''Kojiki''&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards they gave birth to {{nihongo|Awashima|淡島||lit. "island of foam"}}. Neither Hiruko and Awashima were considered legitimate children of Izanagi and Izanami.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p74"/&gt;

Izanagi and Izanami decided to ascend to heaven and consult the primordial gods at [[Takamagahara]] about the ill-formed children that resulted from their union. The gods through divination determined that the woman speaking first during the ceremony was the cause. So the couple returned to Onogoroshima island and repeated the ritual encircling column, only making sure the male-god was the first to speak out greeting. When finished they performed the union successfully and lands began to be born.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth of the islands====
According to the legend, the formation of Japan started with the procreation of eight large islands by Izanagi and Izanami. In order of birth these islands are the following:&lt;ref name="kojiki-p75"/&gt;
[[File:Japan yashima.png|right|220px]]
# {{nihongo|'''Awaji-no-ho-no-sawake-no-shima'''|淡道之穂之狭別島}}: currently, [[Awaji Island]];
# {{nihongo|'''Iyo-no-futana-no-shima'''|伊予之二名島}}: currently, [[Shikoku]]. This island had a body and four faces. The names of the faces are as follows:
#:* {{nihongo|'''Ehime'''|愛比売}}: [[Iyo Province]];
#:* {{nihongo|'''Ihiyorihiko'''|飯依比古}}: [[Sanuki Province]];

# {{nihongo|'''Tsukushi-no-shima'''|筑紫島}}: today, [[Kyūshū]]. This island had a body and four faces. The names of the faces are as follows:
#:* {{nihongo|'''Shirahiwake'''|白日別}}: [[Tsukushi Province]];
#:* {{nihongo|'''[[Toyohiwake]]'''|豊日別}}: [[Toyo Province]];
#:* {{nihongo|'''Takehimukahitoyojihinewake'''|建日向日豊久士比泥別}}: [[Hi Province]];

# {{nihongo|'''Ohoyamatotoyoakitsu-shima'''|大倭豊秋津島}}: today, [[Honshu]].  Dubbed {{nihongo|'''Amatsumisoratoyoakitsunewake'''|天御虚空豊秋津根別}}.

Traditionally these islands are known as [[Ōyashima]] (lit. eight large islands) and as a whole are what is currently known as Japan. In the myth neither [[Hokkaidō]] nor the [[Ryukyu Islands]] are mentioned as these were not known to the Japanese at the time of compiling the Kojiki.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p75"/&gt;

Additionally, Izanagi and Izanami then gave birth to six islands:&lt;ref name="kojiki-p75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kojiki-p76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===According to the Nihon Shoki===
The story of this book only differs in that Izanagi and Izanami volunteered to consolidate the Earth. In addition the two deities are described as "god of yang" (陽神 ''youshin'', male deity) and "goddess of yin" (陰神 ''inshin'', female deity) influenced by the ideas of [[Yin and yang]]. The rest of the story is identical, except that the other celestial gods (''Kotoamatsukami'') do not appear, nor are the last six smaller islands mentioned that were born through Izanagi and Izanami.

'''Kálmán Thaly''' (3 January 1839, [[Csép]] &amp;ndash; 26 September 1909, [[Zablát]]) was a [[Magyars|Hungarian]] poet, historian and politician. His most important works are his [[Kuruc]] poetry, the most famous literary forgery in the history of [[Hungarian literature]].

==Work==
Thaly started out as a poet. His poem collections, which appeared between 1857 and 1861, are tinged with a nationalistic fervor. They include ''Do not hurt the Hungarians'' (1857), ''Zengo Park'' (1859), ''Carpathian Horn'' (1860), ''Szekely Horn'' (1861), and ''Dawn of Freedom'' (1861). Later Thaly was increasingly attracted to history.&lt;ref name="Thaly Kalman"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thaly Kalman|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02200/02228/html/04/83.html|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Besides being a poet, Thaly was also a parliamentarian. He was also a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He held an influential place in the country's military affairs. He was instrumental in the founding of the Historical Society, and edited its journal.&lt;ref name=Thaly&gt;{{cite web|title=Thaly Kalman|url=http://www.nyest.hu/hirek/kenytelenek-voltunk-tudomasul-venni-egyes-versekrol-hogy-resze-van-bennuk-thaly-kalmannak|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patriotic Spirit==
Thaly was highly patriotic. As a Hungarian national, he supported [[Francis II Rákóczi]]. In 1873, Thaly started a movement to exhume the grave of Rákóczi, and bring home his remains. Thaly dream was realized only in October 1906, when the remains of his hero were brought home to Hungary.&lt;ref name=Thaly/&gt;

==Works==
Thaly's intense patriotism came through in his books. He wrote five books during his life, all of which bear an unmistakable mark of nationalism.&lt;ref name=Thaly/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6635">This is a list of '''major cities and towns which belonged to the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]''' from the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 until the dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918. Between those dates, the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria consisted mostly of the territories gained by the [[Habsburg Empire]] in the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772. 

Today, the territory of Galicia is split between Poland in the west and Ukraine in the east. At the turn of the Twentieth Century, Poles constituted 78.7% of the whole population of Western Galicia, Ukrainians 13.2%, Jews 7.6%, Germans 0.3%, and others 0.2%. Respective data for Eastern Galicia show the following number: Ukrainians 64.5%, Poles 21.0%, Jews 13.7%, Germans 0.3%, and others 0.5%. Before [[World War II]], many Galician towns, even in the predominantly ethnic Ukrainian east, had substantial Polish, Jewish and German populations.

After teaching humanities and [[theology]] at several schools, like  Coimbra where most of the Jesuit letters were available in uncensored form, he was chosen [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Braga]], then [[missionary]] to the [[Azores]]; he was distinguished by his zeal.&lt;ref name=newgenbio&gt;{{Cite Newgenbio |title=Acosta, Manuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ''A História das Missões dos Jesuítas no Oriente, Até ao Ano de 1568'' (History of the Jesuit Missionaries to the East, until 1568). The manuscript was sent to Rome, translated into Latin, and was then given to the young novice Giovanni Pietro Maffei (1533-1603) to prepare it for publication. Maffei added a considerable amount of text to Acosta's work, entitled De Japonicis rebus epistolarum. This part contains abridged Latin translations of letters sent from the Jesuits working in Japan until the year 1564. In his introduction Maffei congratulates Da Costa on his effort in summarizing the contents of the letters together in a short commentary.&lt;ref&gt;MAFFEI, GIOVANNI PIETRO.

'''Mark Naison''' (born 1946) is a professor of history at [[Fordham University]], the Jesuit University of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Naison|url=http://www.fordham.edu/academics/programs_at_fordham_/history_department/faculty/mark_naison_70075.asp|publisher=Fordham University|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naison, a former political activist, was a member of [[Congress of Racial Equality|Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)]] and [[Students for a Democratic Society|Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)]] in the 1960s. He is a graduate of [[Columbia University]] and holds a Ph.D. in American history.

==Early life==
Mark D. Naison was born in 1946 in the [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] section of Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Naison p.1&lt;/ref&gt; As the only child of Jewish intellectuals (both schoolteachers), Mark D. Naison had an easy childhood. Although he was happy as a child, Naison felt ostracized from his peers because his parents put such an importance on intelligence. Naison rebelled and turned to sports as an outlet and to help him fit in better with the neighbor kids.&lt;ref&gt;Naison p.1-32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Days at Columbia University==
Naison entered [[Columbia University]] in the fall of 1962. By the end of his freshman year, he began to feel like he had to oppose racial segregation more actively. By the fall of 1963, he joined the Columbia chapter of [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]].&lt;ref&gt;Naison p.38&lt;/ref&gt; CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) was a civil rights organization that was pivotal in the United States, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. CORE was started in 1942 and was open to "anyone who believes that 'all people are created equal' and is willing to work towards the ultimate goal of true equality throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;[[Congress of Racial Equality]]&lt;/ref&gt; CORE quickly became one of the university's biggest political-action groups.&lt;ref&gt;Naison p.42&lt;/ref&gt; He signed up to tutor and help organize tenants in East Harlem.&lt;ref&gt;Pekar p.59&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his BA in American History at Columbia in 1966. and his MA in American History in 1967. Naison went on to earn his Ph.D. in American History in January 1976.&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/academics/programs_at_fordham_/history_department/faculty/mark_naison_70075.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Students for a Democratic Society==
By 1967, Naison was participating in anti-war activities sponsored by [[Students for a Democratic Society|SDS]] (Students for a Democratic Society). Although Naison was against the [[Vietnam War]], he had objections to SDS's political style. He felt that they were too wrapped up in Marxist thinking and not concerned enough with the human aspect of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Naison p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1967, SDS held a demonstration against the Reserve Officers Training Corps, or [[ROTC]], on the Columbia campus. Naison participated in the demonstration, but to distinguish himself from SDS members, he wore his athletic jacket and carried a sign saying "jocks for peace".&lt;ref&gt;Naison p.70&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1968 Naison was arrested for civil disobedience at a protest on the Columbia campus at the proposed Harlem site for the new gym.&lt;ref&gt;"New York Times", Feb 29, 1968 pg. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naison p 88-95&lt;/ref&gt; In April of that same year Naison's father and [[Martin Luther King]] died within two weeks of each other. Both of these deaths had profound impacts on Naison. At this point in his life he decided that he needed to be more involved in radical politics. Two weeks after [[King]]'s death there was another protest against the gym and again Naison participated. This time it was organized by the Columbia chapter of SDS and SAS (Student African-American Society). [[Mark Rudd]], SDS's leader, urged the group (of almost 500) to seize buildings to make sure their voices were heard. They soon overtook [[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]], giving them leverage that no other demonstration had ever held. During the building occupation, Naison spoke briefly about the historical context of the march. During his speech he said that "the forces opposing university expansion have the upper hand. Let's not leave this building until we get some serious concessions." During the protest, Naison realized that while he did not necessarily agree with SDS's contempt for white protesters, he also felt that their tactics in the gym protest were far more effective, a realization that led him to join SDS after the strike. After he joined, Naison was asked by [[Rudd]] to use his knowledge of African-American and labor movement history to argue that the nationalist impulse was a progressive force in African-American life in SDS's leadership's fight against the [[Progressive Labor Movement]]. The PLM (generally referred to as PL) included members of SDS who were arguing that [[black nationalism]] was reactionary and that no revolution could be built with separate black and white wings.&lt;ref&gt;Naison p.88-95&lt;/ref&gt; By that fall, Naison had taken on an even greater role in SDS, both in the regional offices and nationally. He participated in many protests and attended the SDS national convention in Chicago in 1969.

When the group calling itself Weatherman was instituted at the SDS national convention in Chicago, Naison was there. Naison even joined another member of the group to sign a lease on a house in South Brooklyn. Naison participated in discussions for the [[Days of Rage]] to be held in Chicago in the fall of 1969. On a Saturday in October 1969 all that changed. Naison was in a park with a group of friends, and while there they met a group of teenagers. They started talking and soon learned that a café across the way would not serve them because they looked like hippies. Furious, Naison and the others marched into the café and demanded that they be served. The police were called and a fight ensued resulting in eleven arrests. After a couple of days in jail, Naison was released on bail (by his comrades) with the assumption that he would contact a gym teacher at a local school to get the word out about the Days of Rage. Naison did not want to put his life on the line and be back in jail within the week. After tangling with members of the Weatherman, Naison ceased associating with the group.&lt;ref&gt;Naison p.106-128&lt;/ref&gt;

Naison was briefly investigated by the [[FBI]]. According to his memoir, the FBI bugged his house electronically and tried to question his neighbors, who, however, refused to say anything about him. After three days, the FBI was satisfied that he was no longer in the Weatherman and they left him alone. Naison lost one of his dearest friends, [[Ted Gold]], during the [[Greenwich Village townhouse explosion|accidental explosion of a Greenwich Village townhouse]] by an amateur SDS bomb-making group. [[Kathy Boudin]], in the house at the time, had been one of his favorite contacts in the New York Collective, and she survived the blast. In his grief over the loss of Gold, Naison wrote a poem, published in ''[[Radical America]]'', as a tribute to his fallen friend.&lt;ref&gt;Naison p.142-143&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
"I remember Ted Gold best...
"He is dead...
Of a bomb meant for better targets..." &lt;/poem&gt;

==Presently==
Asked about his arrest during the Columbia incident, Naison replied, "Getting arrested to protest Columbia's attempt to build a gym in a Harlem Park was something I was proud of at the time—and am still proud of now." Naison claims that his only regret in life has been not leaving Weatherman when they started talking about getting rid of monogamy.

Naison has been on the faculty of [[Fordham University]] in New York City since 1970, where he is Professor of [[African American Studies]] and History, Director of the Bronx African American History Project, and has served as Director of [[Urban Studies]]. His most popular course at Fordham, "From Rock &amp; Roll to Hip Hop: Urban Youth Cultures in Post War America", was the subject of an interview with him on [[National Public Radio]].&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"/&gt;

He has written over a hundred articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naison|first=Mark|title=Mark Naison LA Progressive Author|url=http://www.laprogressive.com/author/mark-naison|work=LA Progressive|publisher=Sharon Kyle|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and published three books on urban history, [[African-American History]], and the [[history of sports]]. Naison has also appeared on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', and [[The Discovery Channel]]'s ''[[Greatest American Competition]]''. He has also been an outspoken critic of [[Teach for America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Teach For America Is Not Welcome in My Classroom|url=http://www.laprogressive.com/teach-america/|newspaper=LA Progressive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naison is co-founder of the [[Badass Teachers Association]], a group dedicated to fighting the [[Common Core Curriculum]] and corporate influences on [[American education]].&lt;ref name=MotherJones2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Tim|title=Inside the Mammoth Backlash to Common Core|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/09/common-core-education-reform-backlash-obamacare|magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|accessdate=2014-09-17|date=September–October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Numa Fustel de Coulanges.jpg|thumb|right|Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]]
'''Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges''' ({{IPA-fr|kulɑ̃ʒ|lang}}; 18 March 1830 – 12 September 1889) was a French [[historian]].  Joseph McCarthy argues that his first great book, ''The Ancient City'' (1864) was based on his in-depth knowledge of the primary Greek and Latin texts.  The book argued that:
:Religion was the sole factor in the evolution of ancient Greece and Rome, the bonding of family and state was the work of religion, that because of ancestor worship the family, drawn together by the need to engage in the ancestral cults, became the basic unit of ancient societies, expanding to the ''gens'', the Greek [[phratry]], the Roman tribe, to the patrician city state, and that decline in religious belief and authority in the moral crisis provoked by Roman wealth and expansion doomed the republic and resulted in the triumph of Christianity and the death of the ancient city state.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M McCarthy, "Fustel de Coulanges, Numa" in Kelly Boyd, ed., '' Encyclopedia of historians and historical writing'' (1999) 1: 429-30. Vol. 1. Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Paris]], of [[Brittany|Breton]] descent, after studying at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] he was sent to the [[French School at Athens]] in 1853, he directed some excavations in [[Chios]], and wrote an historical account of the island.

After his return he filled various educational offices, and took his doctorate with two theses, ''Quid Vestae cultus in institutis veterum privatis publicisque valuerit'' and ''Polybe, ou la Grèce conquise par les Romains'' (1858). In these works his distinctive qualities were already revealed. His minute knowledge of the language of the Greek and Roman institutions, coupled with his low estimate of the conclusions of contemporary scholars, led him to go directly to the original texts, which he read without political or religious bias. When, however, he had succeeded in extracting from the sources a general idea that seemed to him clear and simple, he attached himself to it as if to the truth itself.

From 1860 to 1870 he was professor of history at the [[University of Strasbourg|faculty of letters at Strasbourg]], where he had a brilliant career as a teacher, but never yielded to the influence exercised by the German universities in the field of classical and Germanic antiquities.

It was at Strasbourg that he published his remarkable volume ''[[La Cité antique]]'' (1864), in which he showed forcibly the part played by religion in the political and social evolution of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The book was so consistent throughout, so full of ingenious ideas, and written in so striking a style, that it ranks as one of the masterpieces of the [[French language]] in the 19th century. By this literary merit Fustel set little store, but he clung tenaciously to his theories. When he revised the book in 1875, his modifications were very slight, and it is conceivable that, had he recast it, as he often expressed the desire to do in the last years of his life, he would not have abandoned any part of his fundamental thesis.

Fustel de Coulanges was appointed to a lectureship at the École Normale Supérieure in February 1870, to a professorship at the Paris faculty of letters in 1875, and to the chair of medieval history created for him at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1878, he applied himself to the study of the political institutions of ancient France. The invasion of France by the German armies during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] attracted his attention to the Germanic invasions under the Roman Empire. Pursuing the theory of [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos|JB Dubos]], but also transforming it, he maintained that those invasions were not marked by the violent and destructive character usually attributed to them; that the penetration of the German barbarians into [[Gaul]] was a slow process; that the Germans submitted to the imperial administration; that the political institutions of the [[Merovingian]]s had their origins in the Roman laws at least as much as, if not more than, in German usages; and, consequently, that there was no conquest of Gaul by the Germans.

This thesis he sustained in his ''Histoire des institutions politiques de l'ancienne France'', the first volume of which appeared in 1874. It was the author's original intention to complete this work in four volumes, but as the first volume was keenly attacked in Germany as well as in France, Fustel was forced in self-defence to recast the book entirely. He re-examined all the texts and wrote a number of dissertations, which were dominated by his general idea and characterized by a total disregard for the results of such historical disciplines as diplomatic. From this crucible issued an entirely new work, less well arranged than the original, but rich in facts and critical comments. The first volume was expanded into three volumes, ''La Gaule romaine'' (1891), ''L'Invasion germanique et la fin de l'empire'' (1891) and ''La Monarchie franque'' (1888), followed by three other volumes, ''L'Alleu et le domaine rural pendant l'époque mérovingienne'' (1889), ''Les Origines du système féodal: le bénéfice et le patronat ...'' (1890) and ''Les Transformations de la royauté pendant l'époque carolingienne'' (1892).

Thus, in six volumes, he had carried the work no farther than the Carolingian period. The dissertations not embodied in his work were collected by himself and (after his death) by his pupil, [[Camille Jullian]], and published as volumes of miscellanies: ''Recherches sur quelques problèmes d'Histoire'' (1885), dealing with the Roman colonate, the land system in [[Normandy]]; the Germanic mark, and the judiciary organization in the kingdom of the Franks; ''Nouvelles recherches sur quelques problèmes d'histoire'' (1891); and ''Questions historiques'' (1893), which contains his paper on Chios and his thesis on [[Polybius]].

His life was devoted almost entirely to his teaching and his books. In 1875, he was elected member of the [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques]], and in 1880 reluctantly accepted the post of director of the École Normale. Without intervening personally in French politics, he took a keen interest in the questions of administration and social reorganization arising from the fall of the imperialist régime and the disasters of the war.

He wished the institutions of the present to approximate more closely to those of the past, and devised for the new French constitution a body of reforms which reflected the opinions he had formed upon the [[democracy]] at Rome and in ancient France. But these were dreams which did not hold him long, and he would have been scandalized had he known that his name was subsequently used as the emblem of a political and religious party. He died at [[Massy, Essonne|Massy]] (then called [[Seine-et-Oise]]) in 1889.

Throughout his historical career — at the École Normale and the Sorbonne and in his lectures delivered to the [[Eugénie de Montijo|empress Eugénie]] — his sole aim was to ascertain the truth, and in the defence of truth his polemics against what he imagined to be the blindness and insincerity of his critics sometimes assumed a character of harshness and injustice. But, in France at least, these critics were the first to render justice to his learning, his talents and his disinterestedness.

{{Covert United States involvement in regime change}}

'''Operation Cyclone''' was the code name for the [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) program to arm and finance the ''[[mujahideen]]'', in [[Afghanistan]] from 1979 to 1989, prior to and during the [[Soviet–Afghan War|military intervention]] by the [[USSR]] in support of its [[Client state|client]], the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].  The program leaned heavily towards supporting militant Islamic groups that were favored by the regime of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] in neighboring [[Pakistan]], rather than other, less ideological Afghan resistance groups that had also been fighting the Marxist-oriented [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] regime since before the Soviet intervention.&lt;ref name=bergen68&gt;Bergen, Peter, ''Holy War Inc.'', Free Press, (2001), p.68&lt;/ref&gt;  Operation Cyclone was one of the longest and most expensive covert CIA operations ever undertaken;&lt;ref name="Oily"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=The Oily Americans | date=13 May 2003 | publisher= | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,450997-92,00.html | work =[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-08 | language = | first1=Donald L. | last1=Barlett | first2=James B. | last2=Steele}}&lt;/ref&gt; funding began with just over $500,000 in 1979, was increased dramatically to $20–$30 million per year in 1980 and rose to $630 million per year in 1987.&lt;ref name=bergen68 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riedel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coll"/&gt;  Funding continued after 1989 as the mujahideen battled the forces of [[Mohammad Najibullah]]'s PDPA during the [[civil war in Afghanistan (1989–1992)]].&lt;ref&gt;Crile, p 519 &amp; elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Communists under the leadership of [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] [[Saur Revolution|seized power in Afghanistan]] on April 27, 1978.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert D.|title=Soldiers of God: With Islamic Warriors in Afghanistan and Pakistan|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|year=2008|isbn=9780307546982|pp=115–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new regime—which was divided between Taraki's extremist [[Khalq]] faction and the more moderate [[Parcham]]—signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union in December of that year.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kepel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kepel|first=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=2006|isbn=9781845112578|pp=138–139, 142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taraki's efforts to improve secular education and redistribute land were accompanied by mass executions (including of many conservative religious leaders) and political oppression unprecedented in Afghan history, igniting a revolt by [[mujahideen]] rebels.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt; Following a general uprising in April 1979, Taraki was deposed by Khalq rival [[Hafizullah Amin]] in September.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kepel"/&gt; Amin was considered a "brutal psychopath" by foreign observers; the Soviets were particularly alarmed by the brutality of the late Khalq regime, and suspected Amin of being an agent of the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), although that was not the case.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kepel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blight"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blight|first1=James G.|title=Becoming Enemies: U.S.-Iran Relations and the Iran-Iraq War, 1979-1988|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4422-0830-8|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December, Amin's government had lost control of much of the country, prompting the Soviet Union to [[Soviet–Afghan War|invade Afghanistan]], execute Amin, and install Parcham leader [[Babrak Karmal]] as president.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kepel"/&gt;

In the mid-1970s, Pakistani intelligence officials began privately lobbying the U.S. and its allies to send material assistance to the Islamist insurgents. Pakistani President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]'s ties with the U.S. had been strained during [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|presidency]] due to Pakistan's nuclear program and the execution of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in April 1979, but Carter told National Security Adviser [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] and Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]] as early as January 1979 that it was vital to "repair our relationships with Pakistan" in light of the [[Iranian Revolution|unrest in Iran]].&lt;ref name="Riedel"/&gt; According to former CIA official [[Robert Gates]], "the Carter administration turned to CIA&amp;nbsp;... to counter Soviet and Cuban aggression in the Third World, particularly beginning in mid-1979." In March 1979, "CIA sent several covert action options relating to Afghanistan to the SCC &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Oversight of United States covert operations#NSC Special Coordination Committee|Special Coordination Committee]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;" of the [[United States National Security Council]]. At a March 30 meeting, U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] representative [[Walter B. Slocombe]] "asked if there was value in keeping the Afghan insurgency going, 'sucking the Soviets into a Vietnamese quagmire?'"&lt;ref name="Gates"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Robert Gates|last=Gates|first=Robert|title=From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2007|isbn=9781416543367|pp=142, 144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to clarify this remark, Slocombe explained: "Well, the whole idea was that if the Soviets decided to strike at this tar baby [Afghanistan] we had every interest in making sure that they got stuck."&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=John Bernell|url=http://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4790&amp;context=gradschool_theses|title=The Strategic Mind Of Zbigniew Brzezinski: How A Native Pole Used Afghanistan To Protect His Homeland|date=May 2012|accessdate=2017-10-10|pp=7–8, 12, 29, 45–46, 80–83, 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet an April 5 memo from National Intelligence Officer Arnold Horelick warned: "Covert action would raise the costs to the Soviets and inflame Moslem opinion against them in many countries. The risk was that a substantial U.S. covert aid program could raise the stakes and induce the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; In May 1979, U.S. officials secretly began meeting with rebel leaders through Pakistani government contacts. A former Pakistani military official claimed that he personally introduced a CIA official to [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] that month (Freedom of Information Act requests for records describing these meetings have been denied).&lt;ref name="nsarchive.gwu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB57/essay.html|title=Afghanistan: Lessons from the Last War|first=Michael|last=Evans|website=nsarchive.gwu.edu|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional meetings were held on April 6 and July 3, and on the same day as the second meeting, Carter signed a "presidential 'finding'" that "authorized the CIA to spend just over $500,000" on non-lethal aid to the mujahideen, which "seemed at the time a small beginning."&lt;ref name="Riedel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coll"/&gt;

Brzezinski later claimed that "We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dgibbs.faculty.arizona.edu/sites/dgibbs.faculty.arizona.edu/files/afghan-ip.pdf David N.

Only after the Soviet invasion did some advocate making the Soviets 'bleed' in their own Vietnam."&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

Carter expressed surprise at the invasion. According to Riedel, the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community during 1978 and 1979—reiterated as late as September 29, 1979—was that "Moscow would not intervene in force even if it appeared likely that the Khalq government was about to collapse." Indeed, Carter's diary entries from November 1979 until the Soviet invasion in late December contain only two short references to Afghanistan, and are instead preoccupied with the ongoing hostage crisis in Iran.&lt;ref name="Riedel"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Bruce Riedel|last=Riedel|first=Bruce|title=What We Won: America's Secret War in Afghanistan, 1979–1989|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0815725954|pp=ix-xi, 21–22, 93, 98–99, 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was considered a threat to global security and the oil supplies of the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name="Kepel"/&gt; Moreover, the failure to accurately predict Soviet intentions caused American officials to reappraise the Soviet threat to both Iran and Pakistan, although it is now known that those fears were overblown. For example, U.S. intelligence closely followed Soviet exercises for an invasion of Iran throughout 1980, while an earlier warning from Brzezinski that "if the Soviets came to dominate Afghanistan, they could promote a separate [[Baluchistan]]&amp;nbsp;... [thus] dismembering Pakistan and Iran" took on new urgency.&lt;ref name="Blight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Riedel"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the invasion, Carter was determined to respond vigorously. In a televised speech, he announced sanctions on the Soviet Union, promised renewed aid to Pakistan, and [[Carter Doctrine|committed the U.S. to the Persian Gulf's defense]].&lt;ref name="Riedel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; Carter also called for a boycott of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, which raised a bitter controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toohey |first=Kristine |title=The Olympic Games: A Social Science Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywy9aslk3M8C&amp;pg=PA100 |date=November 8, 2007 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-1-84593-355-5 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] enthusiastically backed Carter's tough stance, although British intelligence believed "the CIA was being too alarmist about the Soviet threat to Pakistan."&lt;ref name="Riedel"/&gt; The thrust of U.S. policy for the duration of the war was determined by Carter in early 1980: Carter initiated a program to arm the mujahideen through Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] and secured a pledge from Saudi Arabia to match U.S. funding for this purpose. U.S. support for the mujahideen accelerated under Carter's successor, [[Ronald Reagan]], at a final cost to U.S. taxpayers of some $3 billion. The Soviets were unable to quell the insurgency and [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrew from Afghanistan]] in 1989, precipitating the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] itself.&lt;ref name="Riedel"/&gt; However, the decision to route U.S. aid through Pakistan led to massive fraud, as weapons sent to [[Karachi]] were frequently sold on the local market rather than delivered to the Afghan rebels; Karachi soon "became one of the most violent cities in the world." Pakistan also controlled which rebels received assistance: Of the [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|seven mujahideen groups]] supported by Zia's government, four espoused Islamic fundamentalist beliefs—and these fundamentalists received most of the funding.&lt;ref name="Kepel"/&gt; Despite this, Carter has expressed no regrets over his decision to support what he still considers the "freedom fighters" in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Riedel"/&gt;

Although Gates described [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI) [[Stansfield Turner]] and the CIA's [[Directorate of Operations (CIA)|Directorate of Operations]] (DO) as contemplating "several enhancement options"—up to and including the direct provision of arms from the U.S. to the mujahideen through the ISI—as early as late August 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Robert Gates|last=Gates|first=Robert|title=From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2007|isbn=9781416543367|pp=146–147|quote=By the end of August, Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq was pressuring the United States for arms and equipment for the insurgents in Afghanistan.&amp;nbsp;...

They responded with several enhancement options, including communications equipment for the insurgents via the Pakistanis or Saudis, funds for the Pakistanis to purchase lethal military equipment for the insurgents, and providing a like amount of lethal equipment ourselves for the Pakistanis to distribute to the insurgents. On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, 1979, the Soviets intervened massively in Afghanistan. A covert action that began six months earlier funded at just over half a million dollars would, within a year, grow to tens of millions, and most assuredly included the provision of weapons.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an unnamed Brzezinski aide acknowledged in conversation with [[Selig S.

[Walter] [[Walter Mondale|Mondale]] was especially helpful in this, giving a forceful pep talk, mercilessly squelching the rather timid opposition of [[David D. Newsom|David Newsom]].' Brzezinski deliberately avoided saying whether the upgraded program included weapons, since Moscow has long sought to justify its invasion by accusing Washington of destabilizing Afghanistan during 1978 and 1979. Strictly speaking, one of his aides later told me, it was not an American weapons program, but it was designed to help finance, orchestrate, and facilitate weapons purchases and related assistance by others.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coll, Harrison, Riedel, and the head of the DO's Near East–South Asia Division at the time—[[Charles Cogan]]—all state that no U.S.-supplied arms intended for the mujahideen reached Pakistan until January 1980, after Carter amended his presidential finding to include lethal provisions in late December 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Steve Coll|last=Coll|first=Steve|title=[[Ghost Wars|Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001]]|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|year=2004|isbn=9781594200076|p=58|quote=The CIA's mission was spelled out in an amended Top Secret presidential finding signed by Carter in late December 1979 and reauthorized by President [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] in 1981.

President Reagan greatly expanded the program as part of the [[Reagan Doctrine]] of aiding anti-Soviet resistance movements abroad.  To execute this policy, Reagan deployed CIA [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary officers to equip the Mujihadeen forces against the Soviet Army.  Although the CIA and Texas Congressman [[Charles Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] have received the most attention for their roles, the key architect of the strategy was [[Michael G. Vickers]], a young CIA paramilitary officer working for [[Gust Avrakotos]], the CIA's regional head who had a close relationship with Wilson. Vicker's strategy was to use a broad mix of weapons, tactics, logistics, along with training programs, to enhance the rebels' ability to fight a guerilla war against the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Crile, George (2003).

The program relied heavily on the [[Pakistan]]i [[President]] [[Mohammad Zia ul-Haq]], who had a close relationship with Wilson. His [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) was an intermediary for funds distribution, passing of weapons, military training and financial support to Afghan resistance groups.&lt;ref name=pildat&gt;[http://www.millat.com/democracy/Foreign%20Policy/Briefing_Paper_english_11.pdf Pakistan's Foreign Policy: an Overview 1974-2004.] PILDAT briefing paper for Pakistani parliamentarians by [[Hasan-Askari Rizvi]], 2004. pp19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with funding from similar programs from Britain's [[MI6]] and [[Special Air Service|SAS]], Saudi Arabia, and the [[People's Republic of China]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-17/brzezinski2.html Interview with Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski-(13/6/97).

All support to the Sunni Mujahideen was funneled through the government of Pakistan, given that the Shiite Mujahideen had close ties to Iran at the time. Given American-Iranian tensions during the period, the US government aided solely the Sunni Mujahideen in Afghanistan.

Reports show civilian personnel from the [[U.S. Department of State]] and the CIA frequently visited the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area during this time, and the US contributed generously to aiding Afghan refugees.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Casey startled his Pakistani hosts by proposing that they take the Afghan war into enemy territory -- into the Soviet Union itself.

The U.S.-built [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] antiaircraft missile, supplied to the mujahideen in very large numbers beginning in 1986, struck a decisive blow to the Soviet war effort as it allowed the lightly armed Afghans to effectively defend against Soviet helicopter landings in strategic areas. The Stingers were so renowned and deadly that, in the 1990s, the U.S. conducted a "buy-back" program to keep unused missiles from falling into the hands of anti-American terrorists. This program may have been covertly renewed following the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan in late 2001, out of fear that remaining Stingers could be used against U.S. forces in the country.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Kabul Confirms New Effort To Buy Back U.S.-Built Stinger Missiles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghanistan: Kabul Confirms New Effort To Buy Back U.S.-Built Stinger Missiles|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1057196.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. offered two packages of economic assistance and military sales to support Pakistan's role in the war against the Soviet troops in Afghanistan. The first six-year assistance package (1981–87) amounted to US$3.2 billion, equally divided between economic assistance and military sales. The U.S. also sold 40 [[F-16]] aircraft to Pakistan during 1983–87 at a cost of $1.2 billion outside the assistance package. The second six-year assistance package (1987–93) amounted to $4.2 billion. Out of this, $2.28 billion were allocated for economic assistance in the form of grants or loan that carried the interest rate of 2–3 per cent. The rest of the allocation ($1.74 billion) was in the form of credit for military purchases. More than $20 billion in U.S. funds were funneled into the country to train and arm the Afghan resistance groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Military and Diplomatic History|date=8 January 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199759251|page=219|chapter=Cold War (1945-1991): External Course}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program funding was increased yearly due to lobbying by prominent U.S. politicians and government officials, such as [[Charles Wilson (Texas politician)|Charles Wilson]], [[Gordon Humphrey]], [[Fred Ikle]], and [[William Casey]].  Under the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration, U.S. support for the Afghan mujahideen evolved into a centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy, called the [[Reagan Doctrine]], in which the U.S. provided military and other support to anti-communist resistance movements in Afghanistan, Angola, and Nicaragua.

The mujahideen benefited from expanded foreign military support from the [[United States]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Pakistan]] and other [[Muslim]] nations. Saudi Arabia in particular agreed to match dollar for dollar the money the CIA was sending to the Mujahideen. When Saudi payments were late, Wilson and Avrakotos would fly to Saudi Arabia to persuade the monarchy to fulfill its commitments.&lt;ref name="Crile, see index"&gt;Crile, see index&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels of support to the various Afghan factions varied. The ISI tended to favor vigorous Islamists like Hekmatyar's [[Hezb-i-Islami]] and Haqqani. Some Americans agreed.&lt;ref name="Crile, see index"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Girardet, Killing the Cranes, 2010, [http://www.chelseagreen.com Chelsea Green]&lt;/ref&gt; However others favored the relative moderates like [[Ahmed Shah Massoud]]. These included two [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] foreign policy analysts, [[Michael Johns (policy analyst)|Michael Johns]] and James A. Phillips, both of whom championed Massoud as the Afghan resistance leader most worthy of US support under the Reagan Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/research/middleeast/bu181.cfm "Winning the Endgame in Afghanistan," by James A.

==Aftermath==
The U.S. shifted its interest from Afghanistan after the withdrawal of Soviet troops. American funding of Hekmatyar and his Hezb-i-Islami party was cut off immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, ''Jihad,'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. also reduced its assistance for Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

In October 1990, U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] refused to certify that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear explosive device, triggering the imposition of sanctions against Pakistan under the [[Larry Pressler|Pressler Amendment]] (1985) in the [[Foreign Assistance Act]]. This disrupted the second assistance package offered in 1987 and discontinued economic assistance and military sales to Pakistan with the exception of the economic assistance already on its way to Pakistan. Military sales and training programs were abandoned as well and some of the Pakistani military officers under training in the U.S. were asked to return home.&lt;ref name=pildat/&gt;

As late as 1991 [[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] persuaded the [[House Intelligence Committee]] to give the Mujahideen $200 million for fiscal year 1992. With the matching funds from Saudi Arabia, this amounted to a contribution of $400 million for that year. Afghan tribes were also delivered weapons which the US captured from Iraq in the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OOHABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT173&amp;dq=House+Intelligence+Committee.+afghanistan.+$200+million+for+fiscal+year+1992&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivwa-o7PTaAhVSjlkKHRu-C2EQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=House%20Intelligence%20Committee.%20afghanistan.%20$200%20million%20for%20fiscal%20year%201992&amp;f=false|title=The Mammoth Book of Covert Ops: True Stories of Covert Military Operations, from the Bay of Pigs to the Death of Osama bin Laden|last=Lewis|first=Jon E.|date=2014-01-16|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|year=|isbn=9781780337869|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter="Charlie Wilson's Real War"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[File:National Park Service 9-11 Statue of Liberty and WTC fire.jpg|200px|thumb|Critics assert that funding the [[mujahideen]] played a role in causing the [[September 11 attacks]].]]

The U.S. government has been criticized for allowing Pakistan to channel a disproportionate amount of its funding to the controversial Hekmatyar,&lt;ref name=bergen67&gt;Bergen, Peter, ''Holy War Inc.'', Free Press, (2001), p.67&lt;/ref&gt; who Pakistani officials believed was "their man".&lt;ref&gt;Graham Fuller in interview with Peter Bergen, Bergen, Peter, ''Holy War Inc.'', Free Press, (2001), p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Hekmatyar has been criticized for killing other ''mujahideen'' and attacking civilian populations, including shelling Kabul with American-supplied weapons, causing 2,000 casualties. Hekmatyar was said to be friendly with [[Osama bin Laden]], founder of [[al-Qaeda]], who was running an operation for assisting "[[Afghan Arabs|Afghan Arab]]" volunteers fighting in Afghanistan, called [[Maktab al-Khadamat]]. Alarmed by his behavior, Pakistan leader General Zia warned Hekmatyar, "It was Pakistan that made him an Afghan leader and it is Pakistan who can equally destroy him if he continues to misbehave."&lt;ref&gt;Henry S. Bradsher, ''Afghan Communism and Soviet Interventions,'' Oxford University Press, 1999, p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA and State Department have been criticized for their direct relationship with Hekmatyar, beyond ISI contact,&lt;ref name="usnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"/&gt; in spite of his being one of the leading heroin smugglers in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQayAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=hekmatyar,+state+department,+visit&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlos_fpPDRAhUKLSYKHVpDA1M4FBDoAQgZMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hekmatyar,+state+department,+visit&amp;f=false|title=War and State Terrorism: The United States, Japan, and the Asia-Pacific in the Long Twentieth Century|first1=Mark|last1=Selden|first2=Alvin Y.|last2=So|date=26 October 2004|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|accessdate=11 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, Pakistani prime minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], concerned about the growing strength of the [[Islamist]] movement, told President [[George H. W. Bush]], "You are creating a [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/75524 "The Road to September 11"]. Evan Thomas. ''Newsweek''. 1 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged Connections of CIA assistance to Bin Laden==
[[Allegations of CIA assistance to Osama bin Laden|Some have alleged]] that bin Laden and al Qaeda were beneficiaries of CIA assistance. This is challenged by experts such as [[Steve Coll|Coll]]—who notes that declassified CIA records and interviews with CIA officers do not support such claims—and [[Peter Bergen]], who argues: "The theory that bin Laden was created by the CIA is invariably advanced as an axiom with no supporting evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coll|first=Steve|title=Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001|publisher=Penguin|year=2004|isbn=9781594200076|p=87|quote=If the CIA did have contact with bin Laden during the 1980s and subsequently covered it up, it has so far done an excellent job.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bergen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergen|first=Peter|title=The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|isbn=9780743295925|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergen insists that U.S. funding went to the ''Afghan'' mujahideen, not the [[Afghan Arabs|Arab volunteers]] who arrived to assist them.&lt;ref name="Bergen"/&gt;

However Sir Martin Ewans noted that the Afghan Arabs "benefited indirectly from the CIA's funding, through the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] and resistance organizations,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9V-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=afghan+arabs,+cia,+ewans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P6vqGOcedj&amp;sig=zfDXhHTD-PAeuIfaDcKH6Lsj2hQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH89ulqePRAhWD4yYKHfs6CLsQ6AEIODAF#v=onepage&amp;q=afghan+arabs,+cia,+ewans&amp;f=false|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: Studies in Asymetric Warfare|first=Martin|last=Ewans|date=1 December 2004|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=11 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "it has been reckoned that as many as 35,000 'Arab-Afghans' may have received military training in Pakistan at an estimated cost of $800 million in the years up to and including 1988."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BREUv91DebIC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Ewans,+%22Afghanistan+--+A+New+History.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gBCMyEP-1-&amp;sig=AwVNMoKS_QDUuKynYBwFRI1oo0Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8vP-PqePRAhUCKCYKHY78D98Q6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=cia&amp;f=false|title=Afghanistan - A New History|first1=Sir Martin|last1=Ewans|first2=Martin|last2=Ewans|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=11 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the CIA's greatest Afghan beneficiaries were Arabist commanders such as Haqqani and Hekmatyar who were key allies of bin Laden over many years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dvtQI1aANTIC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=jalaluddin,+bin+laden&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EVOP5nZNmO&amp;sig=g-kAywYMn8w6RTgcuxUqBesl7pQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK5Y-FqurRAhXhjlQKHXORDVgQ6AEIODAH#v=onepage&amp;q=jalaluddin%2C%20cia%2C%20bin%20laden&amp;f=false Anand Gopal, et al, "Taliban in North Waziristan" in ''Talibanistan: Negotiating the Borders Between Terror, Politics, and Religion'', Peter Bergen, Katherine Tiedemann eds, p.132-142]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB389/|title=The Haqqani History: Bin Ladin's Advocate Inside the Taliban|website=nsarchive.gwu.edu|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haqqani—one of bin Laden's closest associates in the 1980s—received direct cash payments from CIA agents, without the mediation of the ISI.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15719">An '''origin myth''' is a [[myth]] that purports to describe the origin of some feature of the natural or social world. One type of origin myth is the [[creation myth|cosmogonic myth]], which describes the creation of the world. However, many cultures have stories set after the cosmogonic myth, which describe the origin of natural phenomena and human institutions within a preexisting universe.

In [[classics|Western classical scholarship]], the terms '''etiological myth''' and '''''aition''''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] αἴτιον, "cause") are sometimes used for a myth that explains an origin, particularly how an object or custom came into existence.

==Nature of origin myths==
Every origin myth is a tale of creation: origin myths describe how some new reality came into existence.&lt;ref name = "eliade"&gt;Eliade, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, origin myths also justify the established order by explaining that it was established by sacred forces&lt;ref name = "eliade"&gt;Eliade, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; (see section on "Social function" below). The distinction between cosmogonic myths and origin myths is not clear-cut. A myth about the origin of some part of the world necessarily presupposes the existence of the world—which, for many cultures, presupposes a cosmogonic myth. In this sense, one can think of origin myths as building upon and extending their cultures' cosmogonic myths.&lt;ref name = "eliade"&gt;Eliade, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in traditional cultures, the recitation of an origin myth is often prefaced with the recitation of the cosmogonic myth.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, pp. 21-24&lt;/ref&gt;

In some academic circles, the term "myth" properly refers only to origin and cosmogonic myths. For example, many [[folklorists]] reserve the label "myth" for stories about creation. Traditional stories that do not focus on origins fall into the categories of "[[legend]]" and "[[Folklore|folk tale]]", which folklorists distinguish from myth.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Mircea Eliade]], for many traditional cultures, nearly every sacred story qualifies as an origin myth. Traditional humans tend to model their behavior after sacred events, seeing their life as an "[[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]]" to the mythical age. Because of this conception, nearly every sacred story describes events that established a new paradigm for human behavior, and thus nearly every sacred story is a story about a creation.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Eliade, pp. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social function==
{{See also|Myth and ritual|Eternal return (Eliade)}}
An origin myth often functions to justify the current state of affairs. In traditional cultures, the entities and forces described in origin myths are often considered sacred. Thus, by attributing the state of the universe to the actions of these entities and forces, origin myths give the current order an aura of sacredness: "Myths reveal that the World, man, and life have a supernatural origin and history, and that this history is significant, precious, and exemplary."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultures instil the expectation that people take mythical gods and heroes as their [[role model]]s, imitating their deeds and upholding the customs they established:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the missionary and ethnologist C. Strehlow asked the Australian Arunta why they performed certain ceremonies, the answer was always: "Because the ancestors so commanded it." The Kai of New Guinea refused to change their way of living and working, and they explained: "It was thus that the Nemu (the Mythical Ancestors) did, and we do likewise." Asked the reason for a particular detail in a ceremony, a Navaho chanter answered: "Because the Holy People did it that way in the first place." We find exactly the same justification in the prayer that accompanies a primitive Tibetan ritual: "As it has been handed down from the beginning of the earth’s creation, so must we sacrifice. … As our ancestors in ancient times did—so do we now."&lt;ref&gt;
Eliade, pp. 6–7
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Founding myths unite people and tend to include mystical events along the way to make "founders" seem more desirable and heroic. Ruling monarchs or aristocracies may allege descent from mythical founders/gods/heroes in order to legitimate their control. For example: [[Julius Caesar]] and his relatives claimed [[Aeneas]] (and through Aeneas, the goddess [[Venus]]) as an ancestor.

==Founding myth==
[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - The Dispute of Minerva and Neptune, 1689.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|''The Dispute of [[Minerva]] and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'' ({{circa}} 1689 or 1706) by [[René-Antoine Houasse]], depicting the founding myth of [[Athens]]]]

A "founding myth" or [[Etiology|etiological]] myth (Greek ''aition'') explains either:

* the origins of a [[ritual]] or of the founding of a city
* the [[ethnogenesis]] of a group presented as a [[genealogy]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herwig Wolfram]], ''The History of the Goths'', Thomas J. Dunlap, tr., especially "Gothic history as historical ethnography", 1988:1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[founding father]] and thus of a nation (''natio'', "birth")
* the spiritual origins of a belief, philosophy, discipline, or idea - presented as a narrative

A founding myth may serve as the primary ''[[exemplum]]'', as the myth of [[Ixion]] was the original Greek example of a murderer rendered unclean by his crime, who needed cleansing (''[[catharsis]]'') of his impurity.

Founding myths feature prominently in [[Greek mythology]]. "Ancient Greek rituals were bound to prominent local groups and hence to specific localities", [[Walter Burkert]] has observed.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Homo Necans'' (1972) 1983:83.&lt;/ref&gt; "i.e. the sanctuaries and altars that had been set up for all time". Thus Greek and Hebrew founding myths established the special relationship between a deity and local people, who traced their origins from a [[hero]] and authenticated their ancestral rights through the founding myth. Greek founding myths often embody a justification for the ancient overturning of an older, archaic order, reformulating a historical event anchored in the social and natural world to valorize current community practices, creating symbolic narratives of "collective importance"&lt;ref&gt;Myth as "narratives of collective importance" is often part of the definition of myth, both Greek and other; see [[Walter Burkert]], ''Structure and history in Greek mythology and ritual'', 1982:23; Jan N. Bremmer, ''Interpretations of Greek mythology'', "What is a Greek myth?" 1987:1; Mark P. O. Morford and Robert J. Lenardon, ''Classical Mythology'' 1999:12.&lt;/ref&gt; enriched with metaphor in order to account for traditional chronologies, and constructing an etiology considered to be plausible among those with a cultural investment.&lt;ref&gt;These structures of Greek foundation myths within their historical and cultural contexts, and the particular example of the founding of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], are analysed, in terms first laid out by [[Georges Dumézil]], by [[Claude Calame]], ''Myth and History in Ancient Greece: the symbolic creation of a colony'' rev. tr. of ''Mythe et histoire dans l'antiquité grecque'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Greek view, the mythic past had deep roots in ''historic'' time, its legends treated as facts, as Carlo Brillante has noted,&lt;ref&gt;Brillante, "Myth and history: the historical interpretation of myth" in L. Edmunds, ''Approaches to Greek Myth'' (1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;91&amp;ndash;140.&lt;/ref&gt; its heroic protagonists seen as links between the "age of origins" and the mortal, everyday world that succeeded it. A modern translator of [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' has noted, of the many ''aitia'' embedded as digressions in that Hellenistic epic, that "crucial to social stability had to be the function of myths in providing explanations, authorization or empowerment for the present in terms of origins: this could apply, not only to foundations or charter myths and [[genealogical tree]]s (thus supporting family or territorial claims) but also to personal moral choices."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, Introduction to ''Argonautika'', expanded ed. 2007, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In the period after [[Alexander the Great]] expanded the [[Hellenistic]] world, Greek poetry—[[Callimachus]] wrote a whole work simply titled ''[[Aitia]]''—is replete with founding myths. Simon Goldhill employs the metaphor of [[sedimentation]] in describing Apollonius' laying down of layers "where each object, cult, ritual, name, may be opened... into a narrative of origination, and where each narrative, each event, may lead to a cult, ritual, name, monument."&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill, "The paradigms of epic: Apollonius Rhodius and the examples of the past", in ''The Poet's Voice: Essays on Poetics and Greek Literature'' (1991), ch. 5, pp.&amp;nbsp;284&amp;ndash;333, noted in Peter Green 2007, note on ''Argonautica'' I.1070&amp;ndash;77, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable example is the myth of the foundation of Rome—the tale of [[Romulus and Remus]], which [[Virgil]] in turn broadens in his ''[[Aeneid]]'' with the odyssey of [[Aeneas]] and his razing of [[Lavinium]], and his son [[Iulus]]'s later relocation and rule of the famous twins' birthplace [[Alba Longa]], and their descent from his royal line, thus fitting perfectly into the already established canon of events. Similarly, the Old Testament's story of [[the Exodus]] serves as the founding myth for the community of Israel, telling how [[Israelite God|God]] delivered the [[Israelites]] from slavery and how they therefore belonged to him through the [[sinaitic covenant|Covenant of Mount Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CiqF7sVqDQcC&amp;pg=PA73 Kenton L. Sparkes, ''Genre Criticism'', in Thomas Dozeman (ed), :Methods for Exodus", CUP, 2010, p.73]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, founding myths of the [[medieval commune]]s of northern Italy manifested the increasing self-confidence of the urban population and the will to find a Roman origin, however tenuous and legendary. In 13th-century [[Padua]], when each commune looked for a Roman founder - and if one was not available, invented one—a legend had been current in the city, attributing its foundation to the Trojan [[Antenor (mythology)|Antenor]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[Roberto Weiss]], ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford: Blackwell) 1973:18.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger-than-life heroes continue to bolster the origin-myths of many newer nations and societies. In modern-era colonial contexts, waves of individuals and groups come to the fore in popular history as shaping and exemplifying the ideals of a group: explorers followed by conquerors followed by developers/exploiters. Note for example the [[conquistador]]s of the Iberian empires, the [[bandeirantes]] in Brazil, the [[coureur des bois|coureurs des bois]] in Canada, the [[Cossack]]s and the [[promyshlenniki]] in Siberia and in Alaska, the bands of [[American pioneer|pioneer]]s in the central and western United States, and the [[Great Trek|voortrekker]]s in Southern Africa.

==Foundation stories==
'''Foundational stories''' are accounts of the development of [[city|cities]] and [[nation]]s. A foundational story represents the view that the creation of the city is a human achievement. Human control and the removal of ''wild, uncontrolled'' nature is underlined. There are two versions of foundational stories: ''civilization story'' and ''degradation story''.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, John; [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen B. Massey]], Michael Pryke, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Uay0a7V6yZYC&amp;pg=PA141 Unsettling Cities]'' Routledge 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-415-20072-1}} p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

''Civilization stories'' take a view of [[nature]] as dangerous and wild. The development of the city is seen as a successful distancing of humans from nature. Nature is locked out, and humans take pride in doing so successfully. In 1984 the geographer [[Yi-Fu Tuan]] suggested ranking cities according to their distance to natural rhythms and cycles.

''Degradation stories'' (also called ''pollution stories'') take a different stance. The city is seen as spoiling the landscape of the ecological relations that existed before the city was established. There is a sense of guilt for degrading the intact system of nature. In degradation stories true nature only exists outside the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2222">The '''Pokekea Megalithic Site''' is a [[Megalith|megalithic]] [[archaeological site]] in the [[Lore Lindu National Park]]. It is located in the Behoa (Besoa) Valley northwest of [[Bada Valley]]. The Behoa valley is notable for its preserved kalambas, [[megalith]]s shaped like large cylindrical stone vats. The kalambas served as communal funerary urns and resemble in form and function the monuments on the [[Plain of Jars]] in [[Laos]].

At Pokekea there are 27 kalambas,{{Explain|date=June 2017}} together with decorated stone lids and statues ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''arcas''). A kalamba at the park entrance is decorated by faces arranged in a strip along its outer wall. Their features are similar to the arcas in the [[Bada Valley]]. The lids next to the kalambas are also decorated, some with small protruding statues of monkeys and lizards around their edge.{{sfn|Steimer-Herbert|2016|p=313}} Excavations at the site carried out in 2008 by Dwi Yuniawati have shown that kalambas served as family burial chambers containing a minimum of ten people. The kalambas probably did not house the remains of the entire tribe, but were reserved for the elite. The remains show traces of teeth mutilation and cremation.{{sfn|Steimer-Herbert|2016|p=314}}

Analysis of two kalambas at Pokekea carried out in 2006 by Wiebke Kirleis, Valério Pillar and Hermann Behling suggest a date range between 766–898 and 1146–1272 AD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7496">'''Siburius''' (''[[wikt:floruit|fl.]]'' 370s), for whom only the [[Roman naming conventions|single name survives]], was a high-ranking official of the [[Roman Empire]]. He was one of several [[Gauls]] who rose to political prominence in the late 4th century as a result of the emperor [[Gratian]]'s appointment of his [[Bordeaux|Bordelaise]] tutor [[Ausonius]] to high office.&lt;ref&gt;Hagith Sivan, ''Ausonius of Bordeaux: Genesis of a Gallic Aristocracy'' (London: Routledge, 1993), p. 134, and p. 210, note 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Like Ausonius, Siburius came from [[Bordeaux]]. The [[medical writer]] [[Marcellus Empiricus|Marcellus]], their countryman, places Siburius in the company of the historian [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] and Julius Ausonius, father of the political scholar-poet, as peers with a literary expertise in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcellus Empiricus]], ''De medicamentis,'' prefatory epistle 2, in ''Corpus Medicorum Latinorum: Marcelli de Medicamentis Liber'', edited by Maximillian Niedermann (Leipzig: Teubner 1916), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 376, Siburius was ''[[magister officiorum]]'' under Gratian.&lt;ref&gt;Sivan, ''Ausonius of Bordeaux'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded Ausonius as ''praefectus praetorio Galliarum'' ([[praetorian prefect]] of Gaul) sometime before December 3, 379,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' XI.31.7; A.H.M. Jones, “Collegiate Prefectures,” ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 54 (1964), p. 84; Andrea Pellizzari, ''Commento storico al libro III dell'Epistolario di Q. Aurelio Simmaco'' (Pisa 1998), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; and held the office until 382, when he was succeeded by [[Mallius Theodorus]].&lt;ref&gt;David Stone Potter, ''The Roman Empire at bay, AD 180-395'', Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|0-415-10057-7}}, p. 545.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scanty evidence of Siburius's life comes from the correspondence of the [[Antioch]]an scholar [[Libanius]], who has one letter addressed to him&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], epistle 663, pp. 99–100 in the edition of Richard Förster, ''Libanii Opera'' (Leipzig: Teubner, 1903–27), vol. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and two to his son, who had the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Libanius, epistles 982 and 989, pp. 114–115 and 119–120 (Förster's edition).&lt;/ref&gt; Libanius also mentions Siburius once elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Libanius, epistle 973, pp. 107–108 (Förster).&lt;/ref&gt; The son was [[proconsul]] of [[Palaestina Prima]] around 390.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Seeck, ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Auctores Antiquissimi. Q. Aurelii Symmachi quae supersunt'' (Munich 1984), with reference to Libanius, Sievers edition p. 269 (= Förster 989, pp. 119–120).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and religion==
Siburius is the addressee of three letters among the correspondence of [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]], the advocate of religious tolerance who attempted to preserve the [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional religions of Rome]] at a time when [[Christianity]] had become dominant.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. McGeachy, Jr., “The Editing of the Letters of Symmachus,” ''Classical Philology'' 44 (1949), 222–229.&lt;/ref&gt; Symmachus teases Siburius about his archaic writing style (''ἀρχαϊσμὸν scribendi''):&lt;ref&gt;''Epistulae'' 3.44–45, edition of Otto Seeck, ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Auctores Antiquissimi. Q. Aurelii Symmachi quae supersunt'' (Munich 1984); Neil B. McLynn, ''Ambrose of Milan: Church and Court in a Christian Capital'' (University of California Press 1994), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|If you're so in love with the old days, let's return with an equal amount of attention to the time-honored words in which the [[Salii|Salian priests]] chanted and the [[augur]]s pronounced on a bird-omen and the [[Decemviri|Commission of Ten]] established the [[Twelve Tables|legal code]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], epistle 3.44: ''Si tibi vetustatis tantus est amor, pari studio in verba prisca redeamus, quibus salii canunt et augures avem consulunt et decemviri tabulas condiderunt''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the assessment of [[commentary (philology)|commentator]] Andrea Pellizzari, Siburius was indeed "un uomo di grande cultura," a highly cultured person.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Pellizzari, ''Commento storico al libro III dell'Epistolario di Q. Aurelio Simmaco'' (Pisa 1998), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siburius's son still practiced the traditional religions of antiquity; Libanius refers to his [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenism]]. If the father, as seems likely from Symmachus's remarks, also had not converted,&lt;ref&gt;J.A. McGeachy, Jr., “The Editing of the Letters of Symmachus,” ''Classical Philology'' 44 (1949), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Siburius would have been the first non-Christian to hold the [[prefecture]] of Gaul since the death of the emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], and the last to hold the office.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Watts, ''Religion in Late Roman Britain: Forces of Change'' (London: Routledge, 1998), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5095">In the field of [[archaeology]], a '''spit''' is a unit of archaeological [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] with an arbitrarily assigned measurement of depth and extent. It is a method of excavation employed without regard to the [[stratification (archeology)|archaeological stratigraphy]] that may (or may not) be identifiable at the [[archaeological site]] under investigation. The method of excavating in arbitrary spits is most frequently encountered at site excavations which lack any visible or reconstructable [[stratigraphy]] in the [[archaeological context]],  or when excavating through intrusive or [[Fill (archaeology)|fill deposits]].&lt;ref&gt;Roskams (2001:112,214)&lt;/ref&gt;
== Terminology origins==

''Spit'' is an old English word that archaeologists continue to use. It means an arbitrary or artificial level (the latter expression is preferred by American archaeologists).&lt;ref&gt;See Hester ''et al.'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; Today archaeologists rarely dig in spits, except as vertical subdivisions of natural layers that are not naturally subdivided.

== Excavational use ==

The excavation of sites in arbitrary levels was a product of archaeologists excavating for interesting things and structures rather than trying to reveal the strata of an archaeological site in the order they were laid down. As Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]] put it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he methodical digging for systematic information not with the upturning of earth in a hunt for bones of saints and giants or the armoury of heroes, or just plainly for treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler (1954:6)&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Wheeler was a strong advocate for the use of stratigraphy and was very critical of the use of spits, noting that "a modern" (i.e. 1950) Manual of Field Archaeological Methods prepared by a leading American University advocated this method. Apparently an archaeological site was to be excavated using arbitrary levels and then the stratigraphy was drawn in the exposed sections and the two were to be correlated in some way.&lt;ref&gt; Wheeler (1954:53–54)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Australian archaeologist John Clegg comments "Prehistoric archaeologists at Cambridge in the 1950s were taught to dig in spits if:

* there was no section available to dig from, or 
* the stratigraphic layer was too thick, so better split it into spits or 
* the student-workers were beginners.

The theoretical point was that no one can be certain of strata by just digging down with no visible/tangible changes; the first trench should always be in spits, till sections are visible (comment posted to the Ausarch discussion list May 2008).&lt;!--discussion board postings do not usually qualify as usable and citeable sources; would be preferable to have this definition/description sourced from a publ. work --&gt; 

The use of arbitrary levels and Wheeler's critique is discussed by American archaeologists Hester ''et al.'', where they emphasise that the technique is only justified where there is no visible stratigraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Hester ''et al.'' (1975:79–82)&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential textbook, Hole and Heizer's ''An Introduction to Prehistoric Archaeology'', does not overtly condemned spit excavation. Prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist [[Kent V. Flannery]] (writing in the early 1970s) refers to the practice in the context of [[Mesoamerica]]n archaeology, and illustrates its problems;&lt;ref&gt; See discussion in Flannery (1976:14–15).&lt;/ref&gt; the technique continues to find its practitioners.       

Modern stratigraphically based archaeological excavation techniques are discussed in [[Philip A. Barker|Philip Barker]]'s ''Techniques of archaeological excavation'' (1993).

'''''The Memoirs of Naim Bey: Turkish Official Documents Relating to the Deportation and the Massacres of Armenians''''', also known as the "'''Talat Pasha telegrams'''", is a book written by historian and journalist [[Aram Andonian]] in 1919. Originally redacted in [[Armenian language|Armenian]],&lt;ref name=vkn&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dadrian |first=Vahakn |authorlink=Vahakn Dadrian |date=1986|title=The Naim-Andonian Documents on the World War I Destruction of Ottoman Armenians: the Anatomy of a Genocide|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=344 (note 3) |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was popularized worldwide through the English edition published by [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]]s of [[London]]. It includes several documents ([[telegram]]s) that constitute evidence that the [[Armenian Genocide]] was formally implemented as [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Empire]] policy.

The first edition in English had an introduction by [[Viscount Gladstone]].

== Contents ==
According to Andonian, the documents were collected by an Ottoman official called Naim Bey, who was working in the Refugees Office in [[Aleppo]], and handed by him to Andonian. Each note bears the signature of [[Mehmed Talaat Pasha]], the Minister of Interior and later [[Grand Vizier]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The contents of these telegrams ''"clearly states his intention to exterminate all Armenians, outlines the extermination plan, offers a guarantee of immunity for officials, calls for tighter censorship and draws special attention to the children in Armenian orphanages."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal]]. ''A Crime of silence: the Armenian genocide''. London: Zed Books, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The telegrams remain in coded form and are written in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]].

The overall picture emerging from these narrations points to a network of the extermination for most of the deportees.&lt;ref name="vahan"&gt;Dadrian, Vahakn. ''The Naim-Andonian Documents on the World War I Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians: The Anatomy of a Genocide''. [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]], Vol. 18, No.3, August 1986, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; It overwhelmingly confirms the fact of what British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] ([[London School of Economics|LSE]], [[University of London]]) called "this gigantic crime that devastated the Near East".&lt;ref name="vahan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Viscount Bryce]], ''The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915–1916: Documents Presented to Viscount Grey of Fallodon by Viscount Bryce'', with a Preface by Viscount Bryce. The Armenian Atrocities: The Murder of a Nation. [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] and His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1916, Miscellaneous No. 31. p.653.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|One day the following order came from the Minister of the Interior:

{{quote|Although the extermination of the Armenians had been decided upon earlier than this, circumstances did not permit us to carry out this sacred intention. Now that all obstacles are removed, it is urgently recommended that you should not be moved for feelings of pity on seeing their miserable plight. But by putting an end to them all, try with all your might for obliterate the very name ’Armenia’ from Turkey.&lt;ref name="ekw"&gt;The Most Fearful Genocide in the History of the Human Race by Edmond Kowalewski, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|A new and awful order arrived from the Ministry of the Interior. The Government commanded that the life and honour of the [[Armenians]] should be destroyed. They no longer had any right to live.&lt;ref name="ekw"/&gt;}}}}

== Authenticity ==

In 1983, the [[Turkish Historical Association]] (an organization linked to [[Armenian Genocide denial]]) published a now discredited work titled "Ermenilerce Talat Pasa’ya Atfedilen Telgraflarin Gercek Yüzü" by Şinasi Orel and Süreyya Yuca. In the introduction to "The Talat Pasha Telegrams: Historical Fact or Armenian Fiction", its English-language edition published in 1985, Orel and Yuca wrote that the term "genocide" and the term "massacres" were being wrongly applied to define the [[Armenian Genocide]] (which its authors describe as an Armenian "claim" and a "[[calumny]] directed against Turkey"), and that the documents contained within The Memoirs of Naim Bey were forgeries that had been, for more than 60 years, used as the basis for those charges of genocide and massacre. &lt;ref&gt;Şinasi Orel and Süreyya Yuca, "The Talat Pasha Telegrams: Historical Fact or Armenian Fiction", Nicosia, 1986. [http://www.eraren.org/index.php?Lisan=en&amp;Page=YayinIcerik&amp;IcerikNo=179]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French historian [[Yves Ternon]] who convened at the 1984 [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal]] contends that these telegrams however, ''"were authenticated by experts…[but] they were sent back to Andonian in London and lost."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal]]. ''''A Crime of silence'', 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Vahakn N. Dadrian]] has argued in 1986 that the points brought forth by Turkish historians are misleading and has countered the discrepancies they have raised.&lt;ref name=dadrian&gt;Dadrian, Vahakn. ''The Naim-Andonian Documents on the World War I Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians: The Anatomy of a Genocide''. [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]], Vol. 18, No.3, August 1986, p. 550&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish historian [[Niall Ferguson]], professor of history at [[Harvard University]], senior research fellow of [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College, University of Oxford]], and senior fellow of the [[Hoover Institution]], [[Stanford University]], and Richard Albrecht among others also point to the fact that the court did not question the authenticity of the telegrams in 1921–which, however, were not introduced as evidence in court–and that the British had also intercepted numerous telegrams which directly ''"incriminated exchanges between Talaat and other Turkish officials"'',&lt;ref name = Ferguson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Niall|authorlink=Niall Ferguson|title=The War of the World: Twentieth-Century Conflict and the Descent of the West|date=2006|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=1-59420-100-5|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "one of the leading scientific experts, [[Vahakn N. Dadrian]], in 1986, verified the documents as authentic telegrams send out by [...] Talat Pasha". He adds:

{{cquote|"These flaws involve miscounting, misdating, misconversion of dates from old to new style, and careless editing, despite the availability of manifold resources, including staff assistance provided by the Turkish Historical Society—which in the chaos of the armistice were neither available nor affordable by either Naim or Andonian. Besides being incidental rather than central, such problems are endemic to the cumbersome nature of the material itself.

The argument of falsification has been found to be untenable, since the few instances on which the argument is predicated merely involve irregularities. Irregularity is not coterminous, however, with forgery. Forgery presupposes skill, caution, and above all a measure of sophistication geared to avoiding mistakes. The presence and easy detection of such defects in the material under review mitigate against that charge. Indeed, no forger of any value would have produced material so incomplete and so flawed with glaring imperfections; these could have been easily avoided by anyone disposed to forge. Furthermore, a government apparatus known for its chronically erratic methods of transactions cannot be held exempt from such irregularities. Moreover, one is dealing here with highly secret transactions in the midst of a consuming “Great War,” initiated and directed by a political party that relied on diversions and camouflage for the pursuit of its secret designs; irregularity is an integral part of such a mentality."&lt;ref name=dadrian /&gt;}}

Turkish historian [[Taner Akçam]] mentions similarities between the telegrams published by Andonian to extant Ottoman documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akçam|first1=Taner|authorlink=Taner Akçam|title=The Young Turks' Crime Against Humanity: The Armenian Genocide and Ethnic Cleansing in the Ottoman Empire|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=|isbn=978-0691159560|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a book published in 2016, named “The Naim Efendi Memoirs and Talat Pasha Telegrams”, he claims that the memoir and the telegrams are real. Akçam states that throughout his research he has discovered some serious new information and documents supporting his claim. Akçam summarizes them as following:

* There was, in fact, an Ottoman officer named Naim Efendi. The original Ottoman documents that prove this exist, and some of them are published in Akçam's book.
* There is a memoir that belongs to Naim Efendi. The microfiche copies of it, which he wrote in Ottoman in his own handwriting, are currently in Akçam’s possession. In his book he presents these pages as they are.
* The memoir is genuine and the information it provides is correct. It is possible to find documents in the Ottoman archives referring to the same events and people as the memoir does.
* Turkish historians Şinasi Orel and Süreyya Yuca claimed that the use of lined paper in a telegram indicates that the document is a fake, because, according to them, the Ottoman bureaucracy did not use lined paper. Akçam presents evidence that during this particular time period the Ottoman bureaucracy did use lined paper and there are lots of documents in the Ottoman archives that show that the Internal Ministry’s numerous agencies were ordering lined paper.
* The telegrams that Naim Efendi sold to Andonian consist of two and three-digit codes. Orel and Yuca claim that during the war years the Ottoman government only used coding techniques that consisted of four and five-digit codes. Thus, they said, the telegrams were fake. Akçam presents evidence that during the war years the Ottoman government used numerical codes consisting of various different digit groupings to send orders via telegram. The texts he has discovered in the Ottoman archives used a series of two, three, four, and five-digit codes.&lt;ref&gt;“Akçam: The Authenticity of the Naim Efendi Memoirs and Talat Pasha Telegrams” in: The Armenian Weekly, October 11, 2016  http://armenianweekly.com/2016/10/11/akcam-memoirs-telegrams/  &lt;/ref&gt;

===Revisionism===

[[Guenter Lewy]], a [[Political science|political scientist]] and [[Armenian Genocide|Genocide]] denier, also states that the telegrams form the "centerpiece" of "the case against the Turks", that the authenticity of the Naim-Andonian documents "will only be resolved through the discovery and publication of relevant Ottoman documents", and calls Orel and Yuca's work a "painstaking analysis of these documents" that makes "any use of them in a serious scholarly work unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;Guenter Lewy ''The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey: A Disputed Genocide'', University of Utah Press 2005, pp. 65-73&lt;/ref&gt; About this position [[David Bruce MacDonald|David B. MacDonald]] wrote that Lewy is content to rely on the work of "Turkish deniers Şinasi Orel and Sureyya Yuca": "Lewy's conception of shaky pillars echoes the work of [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]], who also see Holocaust history resting on pillars... This is a dangerous proposition, because it assumes from the start that genocide scholarship rests on lies which can easily be disproved once a deeper examination of the historical 'truth' is undertaken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=David B.|authorlink=David Bruce MacDonald|title=Identity Politics in the Age of Genocide: The Holocaust and Historical Representation|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=|isbn=0-415-43061-5|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus''''' ('''TLP''') ([[Latin]] for "Logico-Philosophical Treatise") is the only book-length philosophical work published by the Austrian [[philosopher]] [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his lifetime. The project had a broad aim{{spaced ndash}}to identify the relationship between language and reality and to define the limits of science&lt;ref&gt;TLP 4.113&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}and is recognized as a significant philosophical work of the twentieth century. [[G. E. Moore]] originally suggested the work's Latin title as homage to the ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'' by [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Nils-Eric Sahlin, ''The Philosophy of F. P. Ramsey'' (1990), p.&amp;nbsp;227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein wrote the notes for the ''Tractatus'' while he was a soldier during [[World War I]] and completed it during a military leave in the summer of 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Monk p.154&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in German in 1921 as ''Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung''. The ''Tractatus'' was influential chiefly amongst the [[Logical Positivism|logical positivists]] of the [[Vienna Circle]], such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Friedrich Waismann]]. [[Bertrand Russell]]'s article "The Philosophy of Logical Atomism" is presented as a working out of ideas that he had learned from Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell (1918), "The Philosophy of Logical Atomism". ''The Monist''. p.&amp;nbsp;177, as published, for example in [http://www.hist-analytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf Bertrand Russell (Robert Charles Marsh ed.) ''Logic and Knowledge''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517102630/http://www.hist-analytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }} Accessed 2010-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tractatus'' employs an austere and succinct literary style. The work contains almost no arguments as such, but rather consists of declarative statements, or passages, that are meant to be self-evident. The statements are hierarchically numbered, with seven basic propositions at the primary level (numbered 1–7), with each sub-level being a comment on or elaboration of the statement at the next higher level (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13).  In all, the Tractatus comprises 526 numbered statements, with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 having 7, 79, 74, 109, 151, 105 and 1 associated statement(s), respectively.

Wittgenstein's later works, notably the posthumously published ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', criticised many of the ideas in the ''Tractatus''.

== Main theses ==

[[File:Tractatus Logico Philosophicus Text Structure.png|thumb|right|Illustration of the structure of the Tractatus.  Only "primary" and "secondary" statements are reproduced, while the structure of the rest is indicated pictorially.]]

There are seven main [[proposition]]s in the text. These are:
# The world is everything that is the case.
# What is the case (a fact) is the existence of states of affairs.
# A logical picture of facts is a thought.
# A thought is a proposition with a sense.
# A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)
# The general form of a proposition is the general form of a [[truth function]], which is: &lt;math&gt;[\bar p,\bar\xi, N(\bar\xi)]&lt;/math&gt;. This is the general form of a proposition.
# Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.

===Proposition 1===
The first chapter is very brief:

{{quote|{{plainlist|
*1 The world is all that is the case.
*1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
*1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the facts.
*1.12 For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the case.
*1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.
*1.2 The world divides into facts.
*1.21 Each item can be the case or not the case while everything else remains the same.}}}}

This along with the beginning of two can be taken to be the relevant parts of Wittgenstein's metaphysical view that he will use to support his picture theory of language.

===Propositions 2 and 3===
These sections concern Wittgenstein's view that the sensible, changing world we perceive does not consist of substance but of facts. Proposition two begins with a discussion of objects, form and substance.

{{quote|{{plainlist|
*2 What is the case—a fact—is the existence of atomic facts.
*2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).}}}}

This epistemic notion is further clarified by a discussion of objects or things as metaphysical substances.

{{quote|{{plainlist|
*2.0141 The possibility of its occurrence in atomic facts is the form of an object.
*2.02 Objects are simple.
*...
*2.021 Objects make up the substance of the world. That is why they cannot be composite.}}}}

His use of the word "composite" in 2.021 can be taken to mean a combination of form and matter, in the Platonic sense.

The notion of a static unchanging [[Platonic form|Form]] and its identity with Substance represents the metaphysical view that has come to be held as an assumption by the vast majority of the Western philosophical tradition since [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], as it was something they agreed on. {{nowrap|"[W]hat}} is called a form or a substance is not generated."&lt;ref name="AM"&gt;Aristotle's Metaphysics:  © 1979 by H.G. Apostle Peripatetic Press.  Des Moines, Iowa.   Online translation: {{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.7.vii.html |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; Metaphysics by Aristotle |accessdate=2011-02-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106134238/http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.7.vii.html |archivedate=2011-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Z.8 1033b13)
The opposing view states that unalterable Form does not exist, or at least if there is such a thing, it contains an ever changing, relative substance in a constant state of flux.  Although this view was held by Greeks like [[Heraclitus]], it has existed only on the fringe of the Western tradition since then.  It is commonly known now only in "Eastern" metaphysical views where the primary concept of substance is [[Qi]], or something similar, which persists through and beyond any given Form. The former view is shown to be held by Wittgenstein in what follows:
{{quote|{{plainlist|
*2.024 The substance is what subsists independently of what is the case.
*2.025 It is form and content.
*...
*2.026 There must be objects, if the world is to have unalterable form.
*2.027 Objects, the unalterable, and the substantial are one and the same.
*2.0271 Objects are what is unalterable and substantial; their configuration is what is changing and unstable.}}}}

Although Wittgenstein largely disregarded Aristotle (Ray Monk's biography suggests that he never read Aristotle at all) it seems that they shared some anti-Platonist views on the universal/particular issue regarding primary substances.  He attacks universals explicitly in his Blue Book.
"The idea of a general concept being a common property of its particular instances connects up with other primitive, too simple, ideas of the structure of language. It is comparable to the idea that properties are ingredients of the things which have the properties; e.g. that beauty is an ingredient of all beautiful things as alcohol is of beer and wine, and that we therefore could have pure beauty, unadulterated by anything that is beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blacksacademy.net/content/2975.html |title=Blue Book on Universals citation |publisher=Blacksacademy.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005174215/http://www.blacksacademy.net/content/2975.html |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And Aristotle agrees: "The universal cannot be a substance in the manner in which an essence is ..."&lt;ref name="AM" /&gt; (Z.13 1038b17) as he begins to draw the line and drift away from the concepts of universal Forms held by his teacher Plato.

The concept of Essence, taken alone is a potentiality, and its combination with matter is its actuality. "First, the substance of a thing is peculiar to it and does not belong to any other thing"&lt;ref name="AM" /&gt; (Z.13 1038b10), i.e. not universal and we know this is essence. This concept of form/substance/essence, which we've now collapsed into one, being presented as potential is also, apparently, held by Wittgenstein:
{{quote|{{plainlist|
*2.033 Form is the possibility of structure.
*2.034 The structure of a fact consists of the structures of states of affairs.
*2.04 The totality of existing states of affairs is the world.
*...
*2.063 The sum-total of reality is the world.}}}}

Here ends what Wittgenstein deems to be the relevant points of his metaphysical view and he begins in 2.1 to use said view to support his Picture Theory of Language. 
"The Tractatus's notion of substance is the modal analogue of Kant's temporal notion. Whereas for Kant, substance is that which 'persists' (i.e., exists at all times), for Wittgenstein it is that which, figuratively speaking, 'persists' through a 'space' of possible worlds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein-atomism/#1 |title=Wittgenstein's Logical Atomism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Whether the Aristotelian notions of substance came to Wittgenstein via [[Immanuel Kant]], or via [[Bertrand Russell]], or even whether Wittgenstein arrived at his notions intuitively, one cannot but see them.

The further thesis of 2. and 3. and their subsidiary propositions is Wittgenstein’s ''picture theory'' of language. This can be summed up as follows:
* The world consists of a totality of interconnected atomic facts, and propositions make "pictures" of the world.
* In order for a picture to represent a certain fact it must in some way possess the same [[logical]] structure as the fact. The picture is a standard of reality. In this way, linguistic expression can be seen as a form of [[geometric]] [[projection (mathematics)|projection]], where language is the changing form of projection but the logical structure of the expression is the unchanging geometric relationship.
* We cannot ''say'' with language what is common in the structures, rather it must be ''shown'', because any language we use will also rely on this relationship, and so we cannot step out of our language ''with'' language.

===Propositions 4.''N'' to 5.''N''===

The 4s are significant as they contain some of Wittgenstein's most explicit statements concerning the nature of philosophy and the distinction between what can be said and what can only be shown. It is here, for instance, that he first distinguishes between material and grammatical propositions, noting:

{{quote|4.003 Most of the propositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not false but nonsensical. Consequently we cannot give any answer to questions of this kind, but can only point out that they are nonsensical. Most of the propositions and questions of philosophers arise from our failure to understand the logic of our language. (They belong to the same class as the question whether the good is more or less identical than the beautiful.) And it is not surprising that the deepest problems are in fact ''not'' problems at all.}}

A philosophical treatise attempts to ''say'' something where nothing can properly be said. It is predicated upon the idea that philosophy should be pursued in a way analogous to the [[natural sciences]]; that philosophers are looking to construct true theories. This sense of philosophy does not coincide with Wittgenstein's conception of philosophy.

{{quote|4.1 Propositions represent the existence and non-existence of states of affairs.&lt;br /&gt;4.11 The totality of true propositions is the whole of natural science (or the whole corpus of the natural sciences).&lt;br /&gt;4.111 Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences. (The word "philosophy" must mean something whose place is above or below the natural sciences, not beside them.)&lt;br /&gt;4.112 Philosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity. A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations.

It must set limits to what cannot be thought by working outwards through what can be thought.&lt;br /&gt;4.115 It will signify what cannot be said, by presenting clearly what can be said.}}

Wittgenstein is to be credited with the invention or at least the popularization of [[truth tables]] (4.31) and [[truth conditions]] (4.431) which now constitute the standard [[semantic]] analysis of first-order sentential logic.&lt;ref&gt;Grayling, A.C. ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction,'' Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kneale|Kneale, M. &amp; Kneale, W.]] (1962), ''The Development of Logic''&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical significance of such a method for Wittgenstein was that it alleviated a confusion, namely the idea that logical inferences are justified by rules. If an argument form is valid, the conjunction of the premises will be [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the conclusion and this can be clearly seen in a truth table; it is ''displayed''. The concept of [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] is thus central to Wittgenstein's Tractarian account of [[logical consequence]], which is strictly [[deductive]].

{{quote|5.13 When the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of others, we can see this from the structure of the propositions.&lt;br /&gt;5.131 If the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of others, this finds expression in relations in which the forms of the propositions stand to one another: nor is it necessary for us to set up these relations between them, by combining them with one another in a single proposition; on the contrary, the relations are internal, and their existence is an immediate result of the existence of the propositions.&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;5.132 If p follows from q, I can make an inference from q to p, deduce p from q. The nature of the inference can be gathered only from the two propositions. They themselves are the only possible justification of the inference. "Laws of inference", which are supposed to justify inferences, as in the works of Frege and Russell, have no sense, and would be superfluous.}}

===Proposition 6.''N''===
At the beginning of Proposition 6, Wittgenstein postulates the essential form of all sentences. He uses the notation &lt;math&gt;[\bar p,\bar\xi, N(\bar\xi)]&lt;/math&gt;, where
* &lt;math&gt;\bar p&lt;/math&gt; stands for all atomic propositions,
* &lt;math&gt;\bar\xi&lt;/math&gt; stands for any subset of propositions, and
* &lt;math&gt;N(\bar\xi)&lt;/math&gt; stands for the negation of all propositions making up &lt;math&gt;\bar\xi&lt;/math&gt;.

Proposition 6 says that any logical sentence can be derived from a series of [[Logical NOR|NOR]] operations on the totality of atomic propositions. Wittgenstein drew from [[Henry M. Sheffer]]'s logical [[theorem]] making that statement in the context of the [[propositional calculus]].  Wittgenstein's N-operator is an broader [[infinitary]] analogue of the [[Sheffer stroke]], which applied to a set of propositions produces a proposition that is equivalent to the denial of every member of that set.  Wittgenstein shows that this operator can cope with the whole of predicate logic with identity, defining the quantifiers at 5.52, and showing how identity would then be handled at 5.53-5.532.

The subsidiaries of 6. contain more philosophical reflections on logic, connecting to ideas of knowledge, thought, and the ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]].  The final passages argue that logic and mathematics express only tautologies and are transcendental, i.e. they lie outside of the metaphysical subject’s world. In turn, a logically "ideal" language cannot supply meaning, it can only reflect the world, and so, sentences in a logical language cannot remain meaningful if they are not merely reflections of the facts.

From Propositions 6.4-6.54, the Tractatus shifts its focus from primarily logical considerations to what may be considered more traditionally philosophical foci (God, ethics, meta-ethics, death, the will) and, less traditionally along with these, the mystical. The philosophy of language presented in the Tractatus attempts to demonstrate just what the limits of language are- to delineate precisely what can and cannot be sensically said. Among the sensibly sayable for Wittgenstein are the propositions of natural science, and to the nonsensical, or unsayable, those subjects associated with philosophy traditionally- ethics and metaphysics, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;TLP 6.53&lt;/ref&gt;  Curiously, on this score, the penultimate proposition of the Tractatus, proposition 6.54, states that once one understands the propositions of the Tractatus, he will recognize that they are senseless, and that they must be thrown away. Proposition 6.54, then, presents a difficult interpretative problem. If the so-called ‘picture theory’ of meaning is correct, and it is impossible to represent logical form, then the theory, by trying to say something about how language and the world must be for there to be meaning, is self-undermining. This is to say that the ‘picture theory’ of meaning itself requires that something be said about the logical form sentences must share with reality for meaning to be possible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Michael|last2=Dodd|first2=Julian|date=2009-06-01|title=Mysticism and Nonsense in the Tractatus|journal=European Journal of Philosophy|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=247–276|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0378.2007.00268.x|issn=1468-0378}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires doing precisely what the ‘picture theory’ of meaning precludes.  It would appear, then, that the metaphysics and the philosophy of language endorsed by the Tractatus give rise to a paradox: for the Tractatus to be true, it will necessarily have to be nonsense by self-application; but for this self-application to render the propositions of the Tractatus nonsense (in the Tractarian sense), then the Tractatus must be true.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge philosophy guidebook to Wittgenstein and the Tractatus logico-philosophicus|last=Rowland)|first=Morris, Michael (Michael|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203003091|location=|pages=338–354|oclc=289386356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three primarily [[dialectical]] approaches to solving this paradox&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the traditionalist, or Ineffable-Truths View;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 2) the resolute, ‘new Wittgenstein’, or Not-All-Nonsense View;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 3) the No-Truths-At-All View.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The traditionalist approach to resolving this paradox is to hold that Wittgenstein accepted that philosophical statements could not be made, but that nevertheless, by appealing to the distinction between saying and showing, that these truths can be communicated by showing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On the resolute reading, some of the propositions of the Tractatus are withheld from self-application, they are not themselves nonsense, but point out the nonsensical nature of the Tractatus. This view often appeals to the so-called ‘frame’ of the Tractatus, comprising the preface and propositions 6.54.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The No-Truths-At-All View states that Wittgenstein held the propositions of the Tractatus to be ambiguously both true and nonsensical, at once. While the propositions could not be, by self-application of the attendant philosophy of the Tractatus, true (or even sensical), it was only the philosophy of the Tractatus itself that could render them so. This is presumably what made Wittgenstein compelled to accept the philosophy of the Tractatus as specially having solved the problems of philosophy. It is the philosophy of the Tractatus, alone, that can solve the problems. Indeed, the philosophy of the Tractatus is for Wittgenstein, on this view, problematic only when applied to itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the end of the text Wittgenstein uses an analogy from [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], and compares the book to a ladder that must be thrown away after one has climbed it.

===Proposition 7===
As the last line in the book, proposition 7 has no supplementary propositions. It ends the book with the proposition "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." (''„Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen."'')

===The picture theory===
A prominent view set out in the ''Tractatus'' is the picture theory, sometimes called the [[picture theory of language]]. The picture theory is a proposed explanation of the capacity of language and thought to represent the world.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" &gt;{{harvnb|Kenny|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p44}} Although something need not be a proposition to represent something in the world, Wittgenstein was largely concerned with the way propositions function as representations.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;

According to the theory, propositions can "picture" the world as being a certain way, and thus accurately represent it either truly or falsely.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt; If someone thinks the proposition, "There is a tree in the yard," then that proposition accurately pictures the world if and only if there is a tree in the yard.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;{{rp|p53}} One aspect of pictures which Wittgenstein finds particularly illuminating in comparison with language is the fact that we can directly see in the picture what situation it depicts without knowing if the situation actually obtains. This allows Wittgenstein to explain how false propositions can have meaning (a problem which Russell struggled with for many years): just as we can see directly from the picture the situation which it depicts without knowing if it in fact obtains, analogously, when we understand a proposition we grasp its truth conditions or its sense, that is, we know what the world must be like if it is true, without knowing if it is in fact true (TLP 4.024, 4.431).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Diamond|first=Cora|date=2013-06-20|title=Reading The Tractatus with G. E. M. Anscombe|journal=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Analytic Philosophy|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238842.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199238842-e-022|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238842.001.0001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418203655/http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238842.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199238842-e-022|archivedate=2017-04-18|df=|isbn=9780199238842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Wittgenstein was inspired for this theory by the way that traffic courts in Paris reenact automobile accidents.&lt;ref name="Stern1995"&gt;{{harvnb|Stern|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p35}} A toy car is a representation of a real car, a toy truck is a representation of a real truck, and dolls are representations of people. In order to convey to a judge what happened in an automobile accident, someone in the courtroom might place the toy cars in a position like the position the real cars were in, and move them in the ways that the real cars moved. In this way, the elements of the picture (the toy cars) are in spatial relation to one another, and this relation itself pictures the spatial relation between the real cars in the automobile accident.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005"/&gt;{{rp|p45}}

Pictures have what Wittgenstein calls ''Form der Abbildung'' or pictorial form, which they share with what they depict. This means that all the logically possible arrangements of the pictorial elements in the picture correspond to the possibilities of arranging the things which they depict in reality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SULAVO|title=A Version of the Picture Theory|last=Sullivan|first=Peter|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=90–91|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029172858/https://philpapers.org/rec/SULAVO|archivedate=2017-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if the model for car A stands to the left of the model for car B, it depicts that the cars in the world stand in the same way relative to each other. This picturing relation, Wittgenstein believed, was our key to understanding the relationship a proposition holds to the world.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt; Although language differs from pictures in lacking direct pictorial mode of representation (e.g., it doesn't use colors and shapes to represent colors and shapes), still Wittgenstein believed that propositions are ''logical pictures'' of the world by virtue of sharing logical form with the reality which they represent (TLP 2.18-2.2). And that he thought, explains how we can understand a proposition without its meaning having been explained to us (TLP 4.02), we can directly see in the proposition what it represents as we see in the picture the situation which it depicts just by virtue of knowing its method of depiction: propositions ''show'' their sense (TLP 4.022).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SULAVO|title=A Version of the Picture Theory|last=Sullivan|first=Peter|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=108–109|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029172858/https://philpapers.org/rec/SULAVO|archivedate=2017-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Wittgenstein claimed that pictures cannot represent their ''own'' logical form, they cannot ''say'' what they have in common with reality but can only ''show'' it (TLP 4.12-4.121). If representation consist in depicting an arrangement of elements in logical space, then logical space itself can't be depicted since it is itself not an arrangement of ''anything''; rather logical form is a feature of an arrangement of objects and thus it can be properly expressed (that is depicted) in language by an analogous arrangement of the relevant signs in sentences (which contain the same possibilities of combination as prescribed by logical syntax), hence logical form can only be shown by presenting the logical relations between different sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SULAVO|title=A Version of the Picture Theory|last=Sullivan|first=Peter|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=110|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029172858/https://philpapers.org/rec/SULAVO|archivedate=2017-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Wittgenstein's conception of representation as picturing also allows him to derive two striking claims: that no proposition can be known ''a priori'' - there are no apriori truths (TLP 3.05), and that there is only ''logical'' necessity (TLP 6.37). Since all propositions, by virtue of being pictures, have sense independently of anything being the case in reality, we cannot see from the proposition alone whether it is true (as would be the case if it could be known apriori), but we must compare it to reality in order to know that it's true (TLP 4.031 "In the proposition a state of affairs is, as it were, put together for the sake of experiment."). And for similar reasons, no proposition is necessarily true except in the limiting case of tautologies, which Wittgenstein say lack sense (TLP 4.461). If a proposition pictures a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] in virtue of being a picture in logical space, then a non-logical or metaphysical "necessary truth" would be a state of affairs which is satisfied by any possible arrangement of objects (since it is true for any possible state of affairs), but this means that the would-be necessary proposition would not depict anything as ''being so'' but will be true no matter what the world is actually like; but if that's the case, then the proposition cannot say anything about the world or describe any fact in it - it would not be correlated with any particular state of affairs, just like a tautology (TLP 6.37).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ricketts|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=9781139000697|location=|pages=87–89|language=en|doi=10.1017/CCOL0521460255.003|title = The Cambridge Companion to Wittgenstein|chapter = Pictures, logic, and the limits of sense in Wittgenstein's Tractatus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://philpapers.org/rec/DIATRS|title=The Realistic Spirit: Wittgenstein, Philosophy, and the Mind|last=Diamond|first=Cora|date=1991|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=|location=|pages=192–193|chapter=Throwing Away the Ladder|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502024108/http://philpapers.org/rec/DIATRS|archivedate=2015-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical atomism===
Although Wittgenstein did not use the term himself, his metaphysical view throughout the ''Tractatus'' is commonly referred to as [[logical atomism]]. While his logical atomism resembles that of [[Bertrand Russell]], the two views are not strictly the same.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;{{rp|p58}}

Russell's [[theory of descriptions]] is a way of logically analyzing sentences containing definite descriptions without presupposing the existence of an object satisfying the description. According to the theory, a statement like "There is a man to my left" should be analyzed into: "There is some ''x'' such that ''x'' is a man and ''x'' is to my left, and for any ''y'', if ''y'' is a man and ''y'' is to my left, ''y'' is identical to ''x''". If the statement is true, ''x'' refers to the man to my left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descriptions/#RusTheDes |title=Descriptions (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Russell believed the names (like ''x'') in his theory should refer to things we can know directly by virtue of acquaintance, Wittgenstein didn't believe that there are any epistemic constraints on logical analyses: the simple objects are whatever is contained in the elementary propositions which can't be logically analyzed any further.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;{{rp|p63}}

By ''objects'', Wittgenstein did not mean physical objects in the world, but the absolute base of logical analysis, that can be combined but not divided (TLP 2.02–2.0201).&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt; According to Wittgenstein's logico-atomistic metaphysical system, objects each have a "nature," which is their capacity to combine with other objects. When combined, objects form "states of affairs." A state of affairs that obtains is a "fact." Facts make up the entirety of the world. Facts are logically independent of one another, as are states of affairs. That is, one state of affair's (or fact's) existence does not allow us to infer whether another state of affairs (or fact) exists or does not exist.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;{{rp|pp58–59}}

Within states of affairs, objects are in particular relations to one another.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;{{rp|p59}} This is analogous to the spatial relations between toy cars discussed above. The structure of states of affairs comes from the arrangement of their constituent objects (TLP 2.032), and such arrangement is essential to their intelligibility, just as the toy cars must be arranged in a certain way in order to picture the automobile accident.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;

A fact might be thought of as the obtaining state of affairs that Madison is in Wisconsin, and a possible (but not obtaining) state of affairs might be Madison's being in Utah. These states of affairs are made up of certain arrangements of objects (TLP 2.023). However, Wittgenstein does not specify what objects are. Madison, Wisconsin, and Utah cannot be atomic objects: they are themselves composed of numerous facts.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt; Instead, Wittgenstein believed objects to be the things in the world that would correlate to the smallest parts of a logically analyzed language, such as names like ''x''. Our language is not sufficiently (i.e., not completely) analyzed for such a correlation, so one cannot ''say'' what an object is.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;{{rp|p60}} We can, however, talk about them as "indestructible" and "common to all possible worlds."&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt; Wittgenstein believed that the philosopher's job was to discover the structure of language through analysis.&lt;ref name="Stern1995"/&gt;{{rp|p38}}

[[Anthony Kenny]] provides a useful analogy for understanding Wittgenstein's [[logical atomism]]: a slightly modified game of [[chess]].&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;{{rp| pp60–61}} Just like objects in states of affairs, the chess pieces do not alone constitute the game—their arrangements, together with the pieces (objects) themselves, determine the state of affairs.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;

Through Kenny's chess analogy, we can see the relationship between Wittgenstein's logical atomism and his [[Picture theory of language|picture theory of representation]].&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;{{rp|p61}} For the sake of this analogy, the chess pieces are objects, they and their positions constitute states of affairs and therefore facts, and the totality of facts is the entire particular game of chess.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;

We can communicate such a game of chess in the exact way that Wittgenstein says a proposition represents the world.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt; We might say "WR/KR1" to communicate a white rook's being on the square commonly labeled as king's rook 1. Or, to be more thorough, we might make such a report for every piece's position.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;

The logical form of our reports must be the same logical form of the chess pieces and their arrangement on the board in order to be meaningful. Our communication about the chess game must have as many possibilities for constituents and their arrangement as the game itself.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt; Kenny points out that such logical form need not strictly resemble the chess game. The logical form can be had by the bouncing of a ball (for example, twenty bounces might communicate a white rook's being on the king's rook 1 square). One can bounce a ball as many times as one wishes, which means the ball's bouncing has "logical multiplicity," and can therefore share the logical form of the game.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;{{rp|p62}}  A motionless ball cannot communicate this same information, as it does not have logical multiplicity.&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;

===Distinction between saying and showing===
According to traditional reading of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein's views about logic and language led him to believe that some features of language and reality cannot be expressed in senseful language but only "shown" by the form of certain expressions. Thus for example, according to the picture theory, when a proposition is thought or expressed, the proposition represents reality (truly or falsely) by virtue of sharing some features with that reality in common. However, those features themselves is something Wittgenstein claimed we could not ''say'' anything about, because we cannot describe the relationship that pictures bear to what they depict, but only show it via fact stating propositions (TLP 4.121). Thus we cannot say ''that'' there is a correspondence between language and reality, but the correspondence itself can only be ''shown'',&lt;ref name="Kenny2005" /&gt;{{rp|p56}} since our language is not capable of describing its own logical structure.&lt;ref name="Stern1995" /&gt;{{rp|p47}}

However, on the more recent "resolute" interpretation of the Tractatus (see below), the remarks on "showing" were not in fact an attempt by Wittgenstein to gesture at the existence of some ineffable features of language or reality, but rather, as [[Cora Diamond]] and [[James F. Conant|James Conant]] have argued,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://philpapers.org/rec/CONORT|title=Wittgenstein's Lasting Significance|last=Conant|first=James|last2=Diamond|first2=Cora|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=|editor-last=Kölbel|editor-first=Max|location=|pages=65–67|chapter=On Reading the Tractatus Resolutely|editor-last2=Weiss|editor-first2=Bernhard|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017005848/http://philpapers.org/rec/CONORT|archivedate=2015-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the distinction was meant to draw a sharp contrast between logic and descriptive discourse. On their reading, Wittgenstein indeed meant that some things are shown when we reflect on the logic of our language, but ''what'' is shown in not ''that'' something is the case, as if we could somehow think it (and thus understand what Wittgenstein tries to show us) but for some reason we just couldn't say it. As Diamond and Conant explain:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

{{quote|sign=|source=|Speaking and thinking are different from activities the practical mastery of which has no logical side; and they differ from activities like physics the practical mastery of which involves the mastery of content specific to the activity. On Wittgenstein’s view [...] linguistic mastery does not, as such, depend on even an inexplicit mastery of some sort of content. [...] The logical articulation of the activity itself can be brought more clearly into view, without that involving our coming to awareness ''that'' anything. When we speak about the activity of philosophical clarification, grammar may impose on us the use of ‘that’-clauses and ‘what’-constructions in the descriptions we give of the results of the activity. But, one could say, the final ‘throwing away of the ladder’ involves the recognition that that grammar of ‘what’-ness has been pervasively misleading us, even as we read through the Tractatus. To achieve the relevant sort of increasingly refined awareness of the logic of our language is not to grasp a content of any sort.}}Similarly, Michael Kremer suggested that Wittgenstein's distinction between saying and showing could be compared with [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s famous distinction between "knowing that" and "knowing how".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://philpapers.org/rec/KRETCP|title=Wittgenstein and the Moral Life: Essays in Honor of Cora Diamond|last=Kremer|first=Michael|date=2007|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=|editor-last=Crary|editor-first=Alice|location=|pages=157–158|chapter=The Cardinal Problem of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802003308/http://philpapers.org/rec/KRETCP|archivedate=2016-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as practical knowledge or skill (such as riding a bike) is not reducible to propositional knowledge according to Ryle, Wittgenstein also thought that the mastery of the logic of our language is a unique practical skill that doesn't involve any sort of propositional "knowing that", but rather is reflected in our ability to operate with senseful sentences and grasping their internal logical relations.

== Reception and influence ==

===Philosophical===
Wittgenstein concluded that &lt;!--with --&gt;the ''Tractatus'' &lt;!--he --&gt;had resolved all philosophical problems.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ludwig Wittgenstein |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Editorial Board |author1=Biletzki, Anat  |author2=Matar, Anat  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2002-11-08 |location=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#Bio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was translated into English by [[Charles Kay Ogden|C. K. Ogden]] with help from the teenaged Cambridge mathematician and philosopher [[Frank P. Ramsey]]. Ramsey later visited Wittgenstein in Austria. Translation issues make the concepts hard to pinpoint, especially given Wittgenstein's usage of terms and difficulty in translating ideas into words.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Philosophy and the History of Philosophy |author=Richard H. Popkin |journal=[[Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=82 |issue=11 |pages=625–632 |date=November 1985 |quote=Many who knew Wittgenstein report that he found it extremely difficult to put his ideas into words and that he had many special usages of terms. |postscript=. |jstor=2026418 |doi=10.2307/2026418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tractatus'' caught the attention of the philosophers of the [[Vienna Circle]] (1921–1933), especially [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Moritz Schlick]]. The group spent many months working through the text out loud, line by line. Schlick eventually convinced Wittgenstein to meet with members of the circle to discuss the ''Tractatus'' when he returned to Vienna (he was then working as an architect). Although the Vienna Circle's logical positivists appreciated the ''Tractatus'', they argued that the last few passages, including Proposition 7, are confused. Carnap hailed the book as containing important insights, but encouraged people to ignore the concluding sentences. Wittgenstein responded to Schlick, commenting: "...I cannot imagine that Carnap should have so completely misunderstood the last sentences of the book and hence the fundamental conception of the entire book."&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;[[James F.

A more recent interpretation comes from [[The New Wittgenstein]] family of interpretations under development since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Crary, Alice M. and Rupert Read (eds.). ''The New Wittgenstein'', Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This so-called "resolute reading" is controversial and much debated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The main contention of such readings is that Wittgenstein in the ''Tractatus'' does not provide a theoretical account of language that relegates ethics and philosophy to a mystical realm of the unsayable. Rather, the book has a therapeutic aim. By working through the propositions of the book the reader comes to realize that language is perfectly suited to all his needs, and that philosophy rests on a confused relation to the logic of our language. The confusion that the ''Tractatus'' seeks to dispel is not a confused theory, such that a correct theory would be a proper way to clear the confusion, rather the need of any such theory is confused. The method of the ''Tractatus'' is to make the reader aware of the logic of our language as he is already familiar with it, and the effect of thereby dispelling the need for a theoretical account of the logic of our language spreads to all other areas of philosophy. Thereby the confusion involved in putting forward e.g. ethical and metaphysical theories is cleared in the same ''coup''.

Wittgenstein would not meet the Vienna Circle proper, but only a few of its members, including Schlick, Carnap, and Waissman. Often, though, he refused to discuss philosophy, and would insist on giving the meetings over to reciting the [[poetry]] of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] with his chair turned to the wall. He largely broke off formal relations even with these members of the circle after coming to believe Carnap had used some of his ideas without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hintikka|2000|p=55}} cites Wittgenstein's accusation of Carnap upon receiving a 1932 preprint from Carnap.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Korzybski]] credits Wittgenstein as an influence in his book, ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.generalsemantics.org/store/all-books/56-science-and-sanity-an-introduction-to-non-aristotelian-systems-and-general-semantics.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811061133/http://www.generalsemantics.org/store/all-books/56-science-and-sanity-an-introduction-to-non-aristotelian-systems-and-general-semantics.html |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tractatus'' was the theme of a 1992 film by the Hungarian filmmaker [[Peter Forgacs]]. The 32-minute production, named ''[[Wittgenstein Tractatus]]'', features citations from the ''Tractatus'' and other works by Wittgenstein.

In 1989 the Finnish artist [[M. A. Numminen]] released a black vinyl album, ''The Tractatus Suite'', consisting of extracts from the ''Tractatus'' set to music, on the Forward! label (GN-95). The tracks were [T. 1] "The World is...", [T. 2] "In order to tell", [T. 4] "A thought is...", [T. 5] "A proposition is...", [T. 6] "The general form of a truth-function", and [T. 7] "Wovon man nicht sprechen kann". It was recorded at Finnvox Studios, Helsinki between February and June 1989. The "lyrics" were provided in German, English, Esperanto, French, Finnish and Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=M.A. Numminen – The Tractatus Suite |url=http://www.discogs.com/MA-Numminen-The-Tractatus-Suite/release/3035915 |publisher=Discogs.com |accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The music was reissued as a CD in 2003, ''M.A. Numminen sings Wittgenstein''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Numminen |first1=M. A.|title=M. A. Numminen Sings Wittgenstein. EFA SP 142 |publisher=Zweitausendeins |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vasily Vladimirovich Bartold''' ({{lang-ru|Васи́лий Влади́мирович Барто́льд}}, {{lang-pl|Wasilij Władimirowicz Bartołd}}, {{lang-de|Wilhelm Barthold}},&lt;ref&gt;The following spellings can be found: Vasilij V. Bartolʹd, Vasilij Vladimirovič Bartolʹd, Vasilij Bartolʹd, Vasilij Vladimirovič Bartolʹdu, Wilhelm Barthold, W. Berthold, Wīlhilm Bārtuld, Vasilij Vladimirovič Barthold, V. V. Barthold&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Wilhelm Barthold'''; {{OldStyleDate|15 November|1869|3 November}}  &amp;ndash; 19 August 1930) was a [[Russian Empire]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian of German descent who specialized in the history of [[Islam]] and the [[Turkic peoples]] ([[Turkology]]).

Bartold's lectures at the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] were annually interrupted by extended field trips to Muslim countries. In the two volumes of his dissertation (''Turkestan down to the Mongol Invasion'', 1898-1900), he pointed out the many benefits the Muslim world derived from Mongol rule after the initial conquests. Bartold was the first to publish obscure information from the early Arab historians on [[Kievan Rus']]. He also edited several scholarly journals of Muslim studies, and contributed extensively to the first edition of the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''. In 1913, he was elected to the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. In February 1917 he was appointed to the [[Commission for the Study of the Tribal Composition of the Population of the Borderlands of Russia]].

After the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]], Bartold was appointed director of the [[Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography]], a post he held from 1918 to 1921. He wrote three authoritative monographs on the history of [[Islam]], namely ''Islam'' (1918), ''Muslim Culture'' (1918)  and ''The Muslim World'' (1922). He also contributed to the development of [[Cyrillic]] writing for the Muslim countries of [[Central Asia]].

Most of his writings were translated in English, Arabic, and Persian. Bartold's collected works were reprinted in 9&amp;nbsp;volumes between 1963 and 1977, and whilst Soviet editors added footnotes deploring his 'bourgeois' attitudes, his prestige was such that the text was left uncensored, despite not conforming to a [[Marxist]] interpretation of history. Some of his works have been reprinted more recently in [[Moscow]].

'''W.J. (William Joseph) Rorabaugh''' (born 1945) is an American historian. He is a professor of history at the [[University of Washington]]&lt;ref&gt;http://depts.washington.edu/history/directory/index.php?facultyname=R-57&lt;/ref&gt; and from 2003-08 was the managing editor of ''[[Pacific Northwest Quarterly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_policy_history/v017/17.4rorabaugh.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
He graduated from [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with a PhD in 1976. He is a book reviewer and the author of several works of American history. In July 2006 he became president of the [[Alcohol and Drugs History Society]].

He has studied the history of beer in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23636578/|title=How to drink beer better|date=March 16, 2008|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rorabaugh's 1979 book ''The Alcoholic Republic: An American Tradition'' demonstrated the exceedingly high rate of alcohol consumption in the United States in the early nineteenth century. At the time, Rorabaugh argued, "Americans preferred cider and whiskey because those drinks contained more alcohol than beer, which was too weak for American taste... One can only conclude that at the root of the alcoholic republic was the fact that Americans chose the most highly alcoholic beverages that they could obtain easily and cheaply."&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Rorabaugh, ''The Alcoholic Republic: An American Tradition'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1981), 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his more recent work on the decade of the 1960s in American history, Rorabaugh has suggested a redefinition of "the sixties." In his 2002 book ''Kennedy and the Promise of the Sixties'', he wrote: "It is possible to argue that the sixties did not begin until 1965, when African Americans rioted in Watts and when large numbers of American combat troops were sent to Vietnam, and did not end until 1974 when Richard Nixon resigned, or even 1975, when the North Vietnamese marched into Saigon."&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Rorabaugh, ''Kennedy and the Promise of the Sixties'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002), xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Rorabaugh identified the earlier half of the decade as distinct both from the 1950s and "the sixties": "The early sixties, then, is important because it was an in-between time, a short space lodged between a more conservative, cautious, and complacent era that preceded it and a more frenzied, often raucous, and even violent era that followed."&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Rorabaugh, ''Kennedy and the Promise of the Sixties'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002), xix.&lt;/ref&gt;
