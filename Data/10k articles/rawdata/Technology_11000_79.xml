'''Autoconform''' is the [[video editing]] [[post production]] process where an [[online editing]] system combines a [[timecode]] based [[edit decision list]] (EDL) created from an [[offline editing]] system with the original video and audio source material to produce a version of the edited video which is a high quality (usually [[broadcast quality]]) analogue of the programme produced in the offline editing system.

This process can be compared with word processing, where the edits required to make a document are made on a PC, and draft copies are printed out on a low quality printer. When the creative process has been completed, the final version can be sent to a professional printer who can reproduce the document at full quality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1784">A '''back boiler''' is a device which is fitted to a residential heating [[stove]] or open fireplace to enable it to provide both room heat and domestic hot water or central heating. The device is a water filled [[heat exchanger]] enclosed at the rear of the burning chamber with a hot water output at the top of the chamber and a cold water feed at the bottom.

== Water circuit ==
The back boiler is typically used with a gravity feed circuit to the [[hot water cylinder]], with a vent or overflow to prevent excess pressure build up. It can also be connected to a series of radiators to provide central heating but requires an electrical pump to be fitted to circulate the hot water.

== Advantages ==
A back boiler can improve the efficiency of a stove by acting as a heat-sink and can also act as a method of extracting additional heat from the flue system which would otherwise have been lost.
Manufacturers of stoves with back boilers quote efficiency figures of up to 80% on oil-fed models.

== Safety ==
Back boilers require that the [[Water heating|hot water]] or [[central heating]] system be able to disperse all of the heat captured from the fire, otherwise boiling or overheating of the water can occur. Back boilers are strictly regulated in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[UK]] following [[explosion]]s relating to incorrectly serviced or installed back boilers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/si/0260.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bergen Academy of Art and Design''' ({{lang-no|Kunst- og designhøgskolen i Bergen}}) or '''KHiB''' is one of the two independent institutions of higher learning in the [[visual arts]] and [[design]] in [[Norway]]. It is located in [[Bergen]], Norway.&lt;ref name="Ministers 2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ministers |first=N.C. |title=Joint Degrees and the Nordic Countries: Nordic Master Programme – Legal and administrative obstacles |publisher=Nordic Council of Ministers |series=TemaNord |year=2015 |isbn=978-92-893-4066-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v4DVCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138 |access-date=3 October 2018 |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Kunsth%C3%B8gskolen_i_Bergen ''Kunst- og designhøgskolen i Bergen'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Art education has long traditions in Bergen, as the first school of art was established there in 1772, modelled on the Academy of Art in Copenhagen. The present college, Bergen Academy of Art and Design, is a fairly new institution which in 1996 merged two former institutions; ''Vestlandets kunstakademi'' which had been founded in 1972 and ''Statens høgskole for kunsthåndverk og design'' which is dated to 1909.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalprofiles.net/norway/Units/1296.html ''Bergen Academy of Art and Design (KHiB)'' (Study Bergen)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution is spread across several buildings at two campuses. A new building is under construction that is designed by the architectural group [[Snøhetta (company)|Snøhetta]] after winning an International competition in 2005. Planned for 2009, the concept was redrawn to meet budget demands from the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]]. It then took until 2013 before the [[Government.no|Norwegian Government]] came through with the necessary funding for the project. The Academy will take the new building into use after its completion in the autumn of 2017.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://snohetta.com/project/154-khib-bergen-national-academy-of-the-arts Bergen Academy of Art and Design (Snøhetta)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Library ==
The Academy has a library on campus located in Vaskerelven 8. It offers books and periodicals on the subjects of art and design. Although primarily for students and staff, the library also welcomes the public.

== Location ==
Bergen Academy of Art and Design is located in five buildings in the center of Bergen. The main building and reception area is in Strømgaten 1, just across from the Bergen Railway Station. In the vicinity of the main building (around the pedestrian street Marken) the Department of Design is located at Kong Oscarsgate 62 and share a building in Marken 37 with the Department of Fine Art. The Department of Fine Art also has two more locations in buildings at Vaskerelven 8 and C. Sundtsgate 53.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utdanningibergen.no/en/study-in-bergen/bergen-academy-of-art-and-design/ Bergen Academy of Art and Design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025043345/http://www.utdanningibergen.no/en/study-in-bergen/bergen-academy-of-art-and-design/ |date=25 October 2015 }} (University of Bergen)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Departments ==
Since a restructuring of the institution's departments in 2012, the academy have consisted of two departments: Department of Fine Art and Department of Design. In the study year of 2015–16 there are approximately 350 students and around 100 staff members. In addition a range of continuing and further education courses are available.

Students can take a three-year [[Bachelor degree]] or a two-year [[Master degree]] in the following areas:
* Fine Art (specializations in eight fields are offered: Painting and drawing, sculpture and installation, ceramics and clay, time-based art/performance, new media (audio/ video), textiles, printmaking, and photography)
* Furniture and Spatial Design/Interior Architecture
* Visual Communications
* Curatorial Practice (only offered as a master's degree for Scandinavian speaking students)

'''Blackman's theorem''' is a general procedure for calculating the change in an impedance due to feedback in a circuit. It was published by [[Ralph Beebe Blackman]] in 1943,&lt;ref name ="Blackman"/&gt; was connected to [[Signal-flow graph|signal-flow analysis]] by [[John Choma (professor)|John Choma]], and was made popular in the [[extra element theorem]] by [[R. D. Middlebrook]] and the [[asymptotic gain model]] of [[Solomon Rosenstark]].&lt;ref name=Feucht/&gt;&lt;ref name=Choma/&gt;&lt;ref name=Middlebrook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenstark/&gt; Blackman's approach leads to the formula for the impedance ''Z'' between two selected terminals of a negative feedback amplifier as '''Blackman's formula''':
:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_D \frac {1+T_{SC}}{1+T_{OC}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''Z&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' = impedance with the feedback disabled, ''T&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'' = loop transmission with a small-signal short across the selected terminal pair, and ''T&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'' = loop transmission with an open circuit across the terminal pair.&lt;ref name=Palumbo/&gt; The loop transmission also is referred to as the [[return ratio]].&lt;ref name=Hurst/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nicolic/&gt; Blackman's formula can be compared with Middlebrook's result for the input impedance ''Z&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a circuit based upon the extra-element theorem:&lt;ref name=Middlebrook/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeuchtD/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeuchtD1/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{in} = Z^{\infty}_{in} \left[ \frac{1+Z^0_{e}/Z}{1+ Z^{\infty}_{e}/Z}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;Z\ &lt;/math&gt; is the impedance of the extra element; &lt;math&gt;Z^{\infty}_{in}&lt;/math&gt; is the input impedance with &lt;math&gt;Z\ &lt;/math&gt; removed (or made infinite); &lt;math&gt;Z^0_{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance seen by the extra element &lt;math&gt;Z\ &lt;/math&gt; with the input shorted (or made zero); &lt;math&gt;Z^{\infty}_{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance seen by the extra element &lt;math&gt;Z\ &lt;/math&gt; with the input open (or made infinite).

Blackman's formula also can be compared with Choma's signal-flow result:&lt;ref name=Choma1/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{SS}=Z_{S0}\left[\frac{1+T_I}{1+T_Z}\right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z_{S0}\ &lt;/math&gt; is the value of &lt;math&gt;Z_{SS}\ &lt;/math&gt; under the condition that a selected parameter ''P'' is set to zero, return ratio &lt;math&gt;T_Z\ &lt;/math&gt; is evaluated with zero excitation and &lt;math&gt;T_I\ &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_Z\ &lt;/math&gt; for the case of short-circuited source resistance. As with the extra-element result, differences are in the perspective leading to the formula.&lt;ref name=FeuchtD1/&gt;

In 100 grams, cooked mustard greens provide 26 [[calories]] and are a rich source (20% or more of the [[Daily Value]]) of vitamins [[vitamin A|A]], [[vitamin C|C]] and [[vitamin K|K]] which is especially high as a multiple of its Daily Value. Mustard greens are a moderate source of [[vitamin E]] and [[calcium]]. Greens are 92% water, 4.5% [[carbohydrates]], 2.6% [[protein]] and 0.5% [[fat]] (table).

== Uses ==
=== Food ===
The leaves, seeds, and stems of this mustard variety are edible. The plant appears in some form in [[African cuisine|African]], [[Bangladeshi cuisine|Bangladeshi]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Nepali cuisine|Nepali]], [[Pakistani]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], and [[African-American cuisine|African-American]] (soul food) cuisines. Cultivars of ''B. juncea'' are grown for their [[greens (vegetable)|greens]], and for the production of [[oilseed]]. The mustard condiment made from the seeds of the ''B. juncea'' is called brown mustard and is considered to be [[pungency|spicier]] than yellow mustard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sakorn |first1=P.|last2=Rakariyatham |first2=N. |title=Biodegradation of glucosinolates in brown mustard seed meal (Brassica juncea) by Aspergillus sp.

Because it may contain [[erucic acid]], a potential [[toxin]], mustard oil is restricted from import as a [[vegetable oil]] into the United States.&lt;ref name="fda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_89.html|title=Detention Without Physical Examination of Expressed Mustard Oil|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=18 March 2011|accessdate=1 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303021049/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_89.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Essential oil]] of mustard, however, is accepted as [[GRAS]] (Generally Recognized as Safe).&lt;ref name="fda" /&gt;  But in [[Russia]], this is the main species grown for the production of [[mustard oil]]. It is widely used in [[canning]], [[baking]] and [[margarine]] production in Russia, and the majority of Russian [[mustard (condiment)|table mustard]] is also made from ''B. juncea''.

The leaves are used in African cooking,&lt;ref name="prota"&gt;Grubben, G.J.H. &amp; Denton, O.A. (2004) Plant Resources of Tropical Africa 2. Vegetables. PROTA Foundation, Wageningen; Backhuys, Leiden; CTA, Wageningen.&lt;/ref&gt; and all plant parts are used in [[Nepali cuisine]], particularly in the mountain regions of [[Nepal]], as well as in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] cuisine of India and [[Pakistan]], where a dish called ''[[Sarson Da Saag|sarson da saag]]'' (mustard greens) is prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chandrassekaran|first=V.

''tatsai'', which has a particularly thick stem, is used to make the [[Nepali pickle]] called ''achar'', and the [[Pickling#East Asia|Chinese pickle]] ''[[zha cai]]''.

The [[Gorkhas in Pakistan|Gorkhas]] of [[Darjeeling]],  [[Sikkim]] and [[Nepal]] prepare pork with mustard greens (also called ''rayo'' in [[Nepali language|Nepali]]). It is usually eaten with relish and steamed rice, but can also be eaten with ''[[roti]]'' ([[griddle]] breads). In Nepal it is also a common practice to cook these greens with meat of all sorts specially goat meat; which is normally prepared in a pressure cooker with minimal use of spices to focus on the flavour of the greens and dry chillies. ''Brassica juncea'' (especially the seeds) is more pungent than greens from the closely related ''[[Brassica oleracea]]'' ([[kale]], [[broccoli]], and [[collard greens]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=25156799|year=2014|author1=Ghawi|first1=S.

[[Cuisine of China|Chinese]] and [[Japanese cuisine]]s also make use of mustard greens. In Japanese cuisine, it is known as ''takana'' and often pickled for use as filling in [[onigiri]] or as a condiment. Many varieties of ''B. juncea'' cultivars are used, including ''[[zha cai]]'', ''[[mizuna]]'', ''takana'' (var. ''integrifolia''), ''juk gai choy'', and ''xuelihong''.  Asian mustard greens are most often [[stir-fry|stir-fried]] or [[pickled]]. A [[Southeast Asian cuisine|Southeast Asian]] dish called ''asam gai choy'' or ''kiam chai boey'' is often made with leftovers from a large meal. It involves stewing mustard greens with [[tamarind]], dried [[chile pepper|chillies]] and leftover meat on the bone.  Brassica juncea is also known as ''gai choi'', ''siu gai choi'', ''xaio jie cai'', baby mustard, Chinese leaf mustard or ''mostaza''.&lt;ref name="cherryfarms.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherryfarms.co.uk/kaichoi.html|title=Kai Choi - Your British Oriental Vegetable Grower|work=cherryfarms.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531072535/http://cherryfarms.co.uk/kaichoi.html|archivedate=2014-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green mustard===
Vegetable growers sometimes grow mustard as a [[green manure]]. Its main purpose is to act as a [[mulch]], covering the soil to suppress weeds between crops. If grown as a green manure, the mustard plants are cut down at the base when sufficiently grown, and left to wither on the surface, continuing to act as a mulch until the next crop is due for sowing, when the mustard is dug in. In the UK, mustard sown in summer and autumn is cut down starting in October. April sowings can be cut down in June, keeping the ground clear for summer-sown crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.greenmanure.co.uk/products/mustard-green-manure-seeds?variant=1182263232 |title=Mustard Green Manure Seeds |website=greenmanure.co.uk |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228200300/https://www.greenmanure.co.uk/products/mustard-green-manure-seeds?variant=1182263232 |archivedate=February 28, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the disadvantages of using mustard as a green manure is its propensity to harbor [[club root]].

=== Phytoremediation ===
This mustard plant is used in [[phytoremediation]] to remove heavy metals, such as [[lead]], from the soil in hazardous waste sites because it has a higher tolerance for these substances and stores the heavy metals in its cells.&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Naser A. Anjum|title=The plant family Brassicaceae contribution towards phytoremediation|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789400739130|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular,  ''Brassica juncea'' was particularly effective at removing [[cadmium]] from soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=Thorsten|last2=Haag-Kerwer|first2=Angela|last3=Maetz|first3=Mischa|last4=Niecke|first4=Manfred|last5=Povh|first5=Bogdan|last6=Rausch|first6=Thomas|last7=Schüßler|first7=Arthur|title=Micro-PIXE studies of elemental distribution in Cd-accumulating Brassica juncea L|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms|date=September 1999|volume=158|issue=1–4|pages=329–334|doi=10.1016/S0168-583X(99)00356-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of removing heavy metals ends when the plant is harvested and properly discarded. Phytoremediation has been shown to be cheaper and easier than traditional methods for heavy metal reduction in soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc=2266886 |title=Phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soils and water: Progresses and perspectives|journal=Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B|volume=9|issue=3|pages=210–220|year=2008|author1=Lone|first1=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3862">'''Business informatics''' ('''BI''') or '''organizational informatics''' is a discipline combining [[information technology]] (IT), [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] and [[management]] concepts. The BI discipline was created in [[Germany]], from the concept of [[Wirtschaftsinformatik]]. It is an established [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] including [[bachelor]], [[Master's degree|master]], [[IB Diploma Programme|diploma]] and [[PhD]] programs in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]] and is establishing in an increasing number of other countries as well as [[Australia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Poland]] or [[Mexico]]. BI integrates core elements from the disciplines of [[business administration]], [[information system]]s and [[computer science]] into one field.

==Business informatics as an integrative discipline==
BI shows similarities to [[information systems]] (IS), which is a well established discipline originating from [[North America]]. However, there are a few differences that make business informatics a unique own discipline:
# Business informatics includes [[information technology]], like the relevant portions of applied [[computer science]], to a larger extent than information systems does.
# Business informatics includes significant construction and implementation oriented elements. I.e. one major focus lies in the development of solutions for business problems rather than the [[ex post]] investigation of their impact.

[[Information systems]] (IS) focuses on empirically explaining phenomena of the real world. IS has been said to have an "explanation-oriented" focus in contrast to the "solution-oriented" focus that dominates BI. IS researchers make an effort to explain phenomena of acceptance and influence of IT in organizations and the society applying an empirical approach. In order to do that usually [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and quantitative empirical studies are conducted and evaluated. In contrast to that, BI researchers mainly focus on the creation of IT solutions for challenges they have observed or assumed.

Tight integration between research and teaching following the [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldtian]] ideal is another goal in business informatics. Insights gained in actual research projects become part of the curricula quite fast because most researchers are also lecturers at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg-u.de |title=Virtual Global University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303102656/http://www.vg-u.de/ |archivedate=2007-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pace of scientific and technological progress in BI is quite rapid, therefore subjects taught are under permanent reconsideration and revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ives, B., J. Valacich, R. Watson, R.

Therefore, significant hurdles have to be overcome in order to further establish its vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Lyytinen, K., R. Baskerville, J. Livari, D.

In [[computing]], '''CHILL''' (an acronym for '''[[ITU-T|CCITT]] [[High Level Language]]''') is a [[procedural language|procedural]] [[programming language]] designed for use in [[telecommunication]] switches (the hardware used inside telephone exchanges). The language is still used for [[legacy system]]s in some telecommunication companies and for  [[signal box]] programming.

The CHILL language is similar in size and complexity to the original [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] language. The first specification of the CHILL language was published in 1980, a few years before Ada.

[[ITU-T|ITU]] provides a standard CHILL compiler.
A free CHILL compiler was bundled with [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] up to version 2.95, however, was removed from later versions. An [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] version, called Object CHILL, was developed also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author = Jürgen F. H.

[[ITU-T|ITU]] is responsible for the CHILL standard, known as ITU-T Rec. Z.200. The equivalent [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard is ISO/IEC 9496:2003. (The text of the two documents is the same). In late 1999 CCITT stopped maintaining the CHILL standard.

CHILL was used in systems of Alcatel System 12 and Siemens EWSD, for example.

'''Cheetah Marketing''' was a [[United Kingdom]]-based company that produced [[electronic music]]-related hardware products and software for home computer systems during the 1980s. They later changed their name to '''Cheetah International Ltd'''.

Based in Cardiff, Cheetah was run by two brothers, Howard and Michael Jacobson, but owned by Cannon Street Investments. The company was closed in 1993 when the UK recession badly hit the share price of its owners. After this [[Chris Wright (technologist)|Chris Wright]] and Nick Owen bought the music products division and formed [[Soundscape Digital Technology]] Ltd. The joysticks and other computer peripheral products division went to another company in the Cannon Street group.

==Products==

The company originally produced joysticks like the infrared R.A.T. for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] computers and later branched out into music peripherals and stand-alone musical equipment for price conscious home users.

Among their offerings were the [[SpecDrum]] (a sample-based [[drum machine]]), a [[Cheetah Sound Sampler]], a [[Cheetah Midi Interface]], and in the later, 8-bit/16-bit [[drum machines]], [[music sequencer]], and a range of music keyboards (including [[polyphonic synthesizer|polyphonic]] [[analog synthesizer|analog]] / [[digital synthesizer]]s and rack mount modules).

Joysticks and peripherals included the Cheetah 125, Cheetah 125 Plus, Mach 1, and an infrared joypad.

Cheetah's range of music products expanded quickly during the 1980s when they began to work with external designers. Among these were [[Chris Wright (technologist)|Chris Wright]], who later founded [[Soundscape Digital Technology]], Ian Jannaway, who later founded [[Novation Digital Music Systems]] and [[Michael Richard Lynch|Mike Lynch]], who later founded [[Autonomy Corporation]].

Cheetah also distributed the [[Gamate]] handheld console in the UK.

A '''coa de jima''' or '''coa''' ("[[hoe (tool)|hoe]] for harvesting", "hoe") is a specialized tool for harvesting [[agave]]s. 

It is a long, [[machete]]-like round-ended [[knife]] on a long wooden handle used by a [[jimador]] to cut the leaves off an agave being harvested and to cut the agave from its roots. The core (or "heart") left, called ''piña'' ("[[pineapple]]"), is used for the production of [[mezcal]], [[sotol]] or [[tequila]]. 

The shape of the coa is adapted for the efficiency of carrying out these operations.

'''David Greenglass''' (March 2, 1922 – July 1, 2014) was an [[atomic spy]] for the [[Soviet Union]] who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]].  He was briefly stationed at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] uranium enrichment facility at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and then worked at the [[Los Alamos laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]] from August 1944 until February 1946. 

He provided testimony that helped convict his sister and brother-in-law [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Ethel and Julius Rosenberg]], who were executed for their spying activity. Greenglass served nine and a half years in prison.

==Early life and career==
Greenglass was born in 1922 in the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. His parents, Barnet and Tessie, were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Austria, respectively. He attended [[Haaren High School]], and graduated in 1940. He attended [[Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute]] but did not graduate.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

Greenglass married [[Ruth Greenglass|Ruth Printz]] in 1942, when she was 18 years old. The two joined the [[Young Communist League]] shortly before Greenglass entered the [[U.S. Army]] in April 1943. They had a son and a daughter. He worked as a machinist at [[Fort Ord, California]], and then at the Mississippi Ordnance Plant in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. In July 1944, Greenglass was assigned to the secret [[Manhattan Project]], the wartime project to develop the first [[atomic weapon]]s. He was first stationed at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] uranium enrichment facility at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], but was there for less than two weeks. In August 1944 he was sent to the [[Los Alamos laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]]. In order to pass his security clearance, he disguised or omitted details of his communist associations, and had friends write glowing references.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=135–37}}

[[Julius Rosenberg]], who had married Greenglass' sister, Ethel, in 1939, had become an agent for the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), working under [[Alexander Feklisov]]. In September 1944, Feklisov suggested to Rosenberg that he should consider recruiting his brother-in-law, David Greenglass, and his wife.{{sfn|Radosh|Milton|1983|p=444}} On September 21, 1944, Feklisov reported to Moscow: "They are young, intelligent, capable, and politically developed people, strongly believing in the cause of communism and wishing to do their best to help our country as much as possible. They are undoubtedly devoted to us."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Feklisov, report on David and Ruth Greenglass (21 September 1944) {{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Alexander_Feklissov.htm|accessdate=August 19, 2015|title=Alexander Feklissov|first=John|last=Simkin|publisher=Spartacus Educational Publishers|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; David wrote to his wife, Ruth: "My darling, I most certainly will be glad to be part of the community project [espionage] that Julius and his friends [the Russians] have in mind."{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|1999|p=169}}

After Julius Rosenberg recommended his sister-in-law [[Ruth Greenglass]] to his [[NKVD]] superiors for the use of her apartment as a safe house for photography, the NKVD realized that David was working on the Manhattan Project. He was then recruited into Soviet espionage by Ruth at Rosenberg's behest in November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/venona-soviet-espionage-and-the-american-response-1939-1957/b58.gif/image.gif|title=New York 1340 to Moscow|date=September 21, 1944|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenglass began to pass nuclear secrets to the USSR via the courier [[Harry Gold]], and more directly with a Soviet official in New York City.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=140–45}} 

According to the [[Venona project]] intercepts decrypted by the [[National Security Agency]] between 1944 and some time in the 1970s, Greenglass and his wife Ruth were given code names. David was codenamed "KALIBR" ("calibre") and Ruth "OSA" ("wasp").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venona Files: Yet another recruitment by Rosenberg|publisher=[[National Security Agency]]|date=July 11, 1995|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/venona/1944/14nov_recruitment_by_rosenberg.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EzHENfV7?url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/venona/1944/14nov_recruitment_by_rosenberg.pdf |archivedate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Greenglass turned down requests from the Los Alamos Laboratory (and Rosenberg) to work on the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests at [[Bikini Atol]] because he wanted to be with Ruth. He was honorably discharged from the Army on February 29, 1946. Greenglass returned to Manhattan, where, with his brother Bernie, and Julius Rosenberg, he ran a small machine shop known as G &amp; R Engineering.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=258–59}}

On February 14, 1950, Ruth, who was pregnant with their second child, came too close to the gas heater in their [[Lower East Side]] apartment, and her nightgown caught on fire. Greenglass extinguished the blaze, but she suffered severe burns. She was taken to [[Gouverneur Hospital]] for skin grafts. He suffered [[second degree burn]]s to his right hand. He was already aware that the UK and US intelligence agencies had discovered that a Los Alamos theoretical physicist, [[Klaus Fuchs]], had spied for the USSR during the war.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=411–15}} 

Through Fuchs' confession, they found that one of his American contacts had been a man named [[Harry Gold]] from [[Brooklyn, New York]].{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=425–26}}  Gold had passed Fuchs' information on to a Soviet agent, performing the role of courier, and [[Anatoli Yakovlev]] would then pass the information on to his controllers in the USSR.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=289–91}} Through Gold, the FBI's trail led to Greenglass and the Rosenbergs, who had allegedly also used Gold as a courier.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=428–30}} When Fuchs was first captured, Julius allegedly gave the Greenglasses $5,000 to finance an escape to Mexico. Instead, they went to the [[Catskills]] and used the money to seek legal advice.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=428–30}}{{sfn|Radosh|Milton|1983|pp=199–200}}

==Trial and aftermath==
David Greenglass was arrested by the FBI for espionage in June 1950 and quickly implicated Julius Rosenberg. He explicitly denied his sister [[Ethel Rosenberg|Ethel]]'s involvement when he testified before a grand jury in August 1950. In February 1951, weeks before the trial, he changed his testimony to claim that Ethel had typed up his notes. He testified against his sister and her husband in court in 1951 as part of an immunity agreement. In exchange for that testimony, the government allowed Ruth to stay with their two children.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; She was named a co-conspirator, but was never indicted. Greenglass told the court, "I had a kind of hero worship there with [[Julius Rosenberg]] and I did not want my hero to fail&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="law.umkc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/rosenb/ROS_TDGR.HTM|title=David Greenglass, Witness for the Prosecution, Trial Transcript|date=March 1951|publisher=[[University of Missouri-Kansas City]]|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greenglass bomb diagram.png|thumb|Greenglass's sketch of an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]], illustrating what he gave [[Ethel and Julius Rosenberg]] to pass on to the Soviet Union]]
During subsequent testimony in 1951, Greenglass related in detail the secrets he passed on to the Soviet Union.  He falsely attributed passing the cross-section drawing of the Atom Bomb to the Soviets to Julius and he also acknowledged passing other sketches through Gold. He described his work on the molds into which were poured the component of the [[explosive lens]]es of the [[Fat Man]] bombs used for the [[Trinity nuclear test]] and in the [[bombing of Nagasaki]]. At first this was a matter of difficulty for the prosecution, who wanted Greenglass to testify in open court about the secrets he had given—something which would by definition make them no longer "secret".&lt;ref name="law.umkc.edu"/&gt;

The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] decided that the [[Implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion]] concept could be declassified for the trial, and limited all discussion to the weapons used in World War II (fearing that Greenglass may have seen prototypes for future weapons while at Los Alamos). As a result of a surprise defense motion that all testimony about the alleged "secret of the atomic bomb" be impounded, Federal Judge Irving Kaufman at first made all spectators and news reporters leave the room when Greenglass began testifying about his "secrets".&lt;ref name="law.umkc.edu"/&gt;
&lt;!-- COMMENTARY Because we now know that the testimony Greenglass gave about passing the information to Julius Rosenberg in September 1945 to have been false, [See Schneir, Final Verdict, pp. 131–44] the defense's strategy begins to make sense.  Julius Rosenberg had no knowledge of any of this and so his attorney's effort to demonstrate the defendant's concern for national security appeared a gamble worth taking. --&gt;

Ten minutes later, Judge Kaufman invited the news reporters back in, asking them to use their discretion in reporting on Greenglass's testimony. The Rosenbergs' defense attorney, [[Emanuel H. Bloch]], attempted to convince the jury that his clients were concerned about issues of national security, but failed. Greenglass' testimony, later seen to be crude and in the words of many scientists who examined it "worthless", remained sealed until 1966.  He also testified that Rosenberg had stolen and given to the Russians a [[proximity fuze]].&lt;ref name="law.umkc.edu"/&gt;

However, [[Alexander Feklisov|Aleksander Feklisov]] also claimed that Julius Rosenberg supplied him with a whole proximity fuze, which would corroborate at least this part of Greenglass' testimony. During the trial, Bloch claimed Greenglass wanted revenge for the machine shop [[business failure]]. Bloch attempted to discredit Greenglass' character and testimony. At Greenglass' sentencing hearing, his attorney [[O. John Rogge]] repeatedly told the court his client deserved "a pat on the back" for his testimony and argued that a light sentence, no more than five years, would encourage others to follow his example. Greenglass was sentenced to 15 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greenglass Gets 15 Years; Judge Recognizes Spy's Aid|first=William R.|last=Conklin|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1951/04/07/89789235.pdf|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 7, 1951|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released after nine and a half years and reunited with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benjamin|first=Philip|title=Greenglass Freed from Prison.

In March 1953, three months before the Rosenbergs' executions, he wrote a letter for his attorney to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess. He wrote: "if these two die, I shall live the rest of my life with a very dark shadow on my conscience". He described his own testimony as "an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country, my family and myself" and explained how he now viewed its consequences: "Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear to me, and I took it deliberately. I could not believe that this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change that awful sentence."&lt;ref name=kihss&gt;{{cite news|last=Kihss|first=Peter|title=F.B.I.

==Later years==
After his release in 1960, Greenglass and his family lived in New York City under an assumed name. For some years they lived on 228th Street in [[Laurelton, New York|Laurelton, Queens, New York]]. In 1996, Greenglass recanted his sworn testimony in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter Sam Roberts and stated he had lied under oath about the extent of his sister's involvement in the spying plot in order to protect his wife. At the trial, Greenglass had testified that Ethel Rosenberg typed his notes to give to the Russians. However, in the Roberts interview, he stated, "I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don't remember ... My wife is more important to me than my sister. Or my mother or my father, O.K.? And she was the mother of my children."&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; When Roberts asked Greenglass if he would have done anything differently, he replied, "Never."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2001/oct/011009.rosenbergs.html|title=A Brother's Betrayal: Interview by Robert Siegel with Sam Roberts|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=October 9, 2001|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The role of Ethel Rosenberg in her husband's espionage ring remains a matter of dispute.&lt;ref name=sobell&gt;{{cite news|first=Sam|last=Roberts|title=For First Time, Figure in Rosenberg Case Admits Spying for Soviets|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/nyregion/12spy.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 12, 2008|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=McFadden|authorlink=Robert D.

In 2008, when a group of academic historians sought the release of the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings that indicted the Rosenbergs, Greenglass objected to the government's release of his testimony. U.S. District Judge [[Alvin Hellerstein]] declined to order the release of the testimony of Greenglass and other surviving witnesses who withheld their consent or could not be located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weiser|first=Benjamin|title=U.S. Judge Upholds Secrecy of Rosenberg Testimony|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/nyregion/23rosenberg.html|accessdate=June 18, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The grand jury testimony was finally released in July 2015.  Greenglass never mentioned involvement by his sister in Rosenberg's delivery of atomic secrets to the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/nyregion/david-greenglass-grand-jury-testimony-ethel-rosenberg.html|title=Secret Grand Jury Testimony From Ethel Rosenberg's Brother Is Released|first=Sam|last=Roberts|date=July 15, 2015|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Greenglass died on July 1, 2014. He was predeceased by his wife, Ruth, who died on April 7, 2008. His death was not publicly announced by his family and was only discovered on October 14, 2014, when ''The New York Times'' called the nursing home where he had been living under an assumed name.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert |last=McFadden |authorlink=Robert D.

''Deepwater Horizon'' was the second semi-submersible rig constructed of a class of two, although ''[[Deepwater Nautilus]]'', its predecessor, is not dynamically positioned.  The rig was {{convert|396|by|256|ft|abbr=on}} and capable of operating in waters up to {{convert|8000|ft|m}} deep, to a maximum drill depth of {{convert|30000|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="rig spec" /&gt; In 2010 it was one of approximately 200 deepwater offshore rigs capable of drilling in waters deeper than {{convert|5000|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rig Data Centre | url=http://www.rigzone.com/data | work=Rigzone | date=28 May 2010 | accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[American Bureau of Shipping]] (ABS) class notations were "A1, Column Stabilized Drilling Unit, AMS, ACCU, DPS-3".&lt;ref name="mms ivan" /&gt;

In 2002, the rig was upgraded with "e-drill", a drill monitoring system whereby technical personnel based in [[Houston]], Texas, received [[Real-time computing|real-time]] drilling data from the rig and transmitted maintenance and troubleshooting information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.offshore-mag.com/index/article-display/161517/articles/offshore/volume-62/issue-11/news/general-interest/monitoring-system-reduces-rig-downtime.html|title=Monitoring system reduces rig downtime|date= 1 November 2002|publisher=[[PennWell Corporation]]|work=Offshore Magazine|accessdate= 22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced systems played a key role in the rig's operation, from pressure and drill monitoring technology, to automated shutoff systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/it-business/20481/bp-oil-spill-slows-but-serious-it-failures-come-to-surface/|title=BP oil spill ‘slows’ but serious IT failures come to surface|date= 28 May 2010|publisher=Computerworld UK|work=IT news website|accessdate= 12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modelling systems for [[Cementing equipment|cementing]]. The OptiCem cement modelling system, used by [[Halliburton]] in April 2010, played a crucial part in cement slurry mix and support decisions. These decisions became a focus for investigations into the explosion on the rig that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/it-business/3248321/deepwater-horizon-modelling-software-showed-bp-cement-conditions-unstable/|title=Deepwater Horizon modelling software showed BP cement conditions unstable|date= 12 November 2010|publisher=Computerworld UK|work=IT news website|accessdate= 12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At {{Nowrap|9:45 P.M.}} [[Central Time Zone (Americas)|CDT]] on 20 April 2010, during the final phases of drilling the exploratory well at Macondo, a geyser of seawater erupted from the [[marine riser]] onto the rig, shooting {{convert|240|ft|abbr=on}} into the air.  This was soon followed by the eruption of a slushy combination of [[Drilling fluid|drilling mud]], [[methane gas]], and water. The gas component of the slushy material quickly transitioned into a fully gaseous state and then ignited into a series of explosions and then a firestorm. An attempt was made to activate the [[blowout preventer]], but it failed.&lt;ref name=upstream290410&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article213497.ece | first1=Noah |last1=Brenner |first2=Anthony |last2=Guegel |first3=Rob |last3=Watts |first4=Anthea |last4=Pitt  | title=Horizon crew tried to activate BOP | newspaper=[[Upstream (newspaper)|Upstream Online]] | publisher=NHST Media Group | date=29 April 2010 | accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final defense to prevent an oil spill, a device known as a [[Blowout preventer#Types|blind shear ram]], was activated but failed to plug the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/06/21/us/20100621-bop.html|title=Investigating the Cause of the Deepwater Horizon Blowout|date=21 June 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the explosion, there were 126&amp;nbsp;crew on board; seven were employees of BP, 79 of Transocean, there were also employees of various other companies involved in the operation of the rig, including [[Anadarko Petroleum Corporation|Anadarko]], [[Halliburton]] and [[M-I SWACO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Pendlebury |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1287226/GULF-OIL-SPILL-Whys-BP-taking-blame.html |title=Daily Mail special investigation article: Why is BP taking ALL the blame? |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven workers were presumed killed in the initial explosion.

==Aftermath ==
{{further|Deepwater Horizon litigation}}

Transocean received an early partial insurance settlement for total loss of the ''Deepwater Horizon'' of {{nowrap|US $401 million}} around 5 May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Meg|title=Transocean: Insurers Have Already Paid $401&amp;nbsp;Million for Deepwater Horizon Loss|url=http://insurancenewsnet.com/article.aspx?id=188498|publisher=Insurance news net|accessdate=17 June 2010|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Financial analyst]]s noted that the insurance recovery was likely to outweigh the value of the rig (although not necessarily its replacement value) and any liabilities {{ndash}} the latter estimated at up to {{US$|200 million}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fortson |first=Danny |title=Rig firm’s $270m profit from deadly spill |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/natural_resources/article7120655.ece| work=The Sunday Times |accessdate=17 June 2010|date=9 May 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Litigation, ultimate roll call of damage, and the scope of final insurance recovery were all unknown {{as of|2010|06|lc=y}}, with analysts reporting that the aftermath was of unprecedented scale and complexity compared to previous disasters which themselves took many years to unfold and resolve.&lt;ref name="reutersafrica"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stempel|first=Jonathan|title=Special Report - BP oil spill a gusher for lawyers|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE65T2HB20100630?sp=true|accessdate=19 July 2010|newspaper=Reuters Africa|date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kam|first=Dara|title=Valdez expert: Psychological impact of Gulf oil spill won't fully emerge for years|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/valdez-expert-psychological-impact-of-gulf-oil-spill-776588.html|accessdate=19 July 2010|newspaper=palm Beach post news|date=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A July 2010 analysis by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' on the aftermath cited legal sources as saying that "at some point the scale of [[Deepwater Horizon litigation|the litigation]] becomes so large that it really is novel", that "the situation is likely to be complicated further because the variety of probable cases means it will be hard to aggregate them into so-called [[class action]]s" and that there was "no way to put this in historical context because we have never faced anything like this before".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BP: Eagles and vultures|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2bf9db9e-8545-11df-9c2f-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=19 July 2010|newspaper=''[[Financial Times]]''|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill#Litigation and cleanup costs|Exxon Valdez disaster]], litigation was being discussed in terms of a 20-year timescale.&lt;ref name="reutersafrica" /&gt;

In January 2013, Transocean agreed to pay US$1.4 billion for violations of the US Clean Water Act. BP had earlier agreed to pay $2.4 billion but faced additional penalties that could range from $5 billion to $20 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science News | url = http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2013/01/second-oil-spill-settlement-adds.html | author = David Malakoff | title = Second Oil Spill Settlement Adds to Gulf Coast Science and Restoration Funding | date = 3 January 2013 | accessdate= 2013-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, Halliburton agreed to settle a large percentage of legal claims against them by paying $1.1 billion into a trust by way of three installments over two years.&lt;ref name="HalliburtonDeepwater"&gt;{{cite news|title=Halliburton to pay around $1.1 bn for US oil spill claims|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/02/us-halliburton-settlement-macondo-idUSKBN0GX1DT20140902|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=3 September 2014|publisher=''Reuters''}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 September 2014, U.S. District Judge [[Carl Barbier]] ruled BP was guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct under the Clean Water Act (CWA). He described BP's actions as "reckless," while he said Transocean's and Halliburton's actions were "negligent." He apportioned 67% of the blame for the spill to BP, 30% to Transocean, and 3% to Halliburton. BP issued a statement strongly disagreeing with the finding, and saying the court's decision would be appealed.&lt;ref name="BPverdict"&gt;{{cite news|title=BP found "grossly negligent' in Gulf of Mexico oil spill|url=http://www.neworleanssun.com/index.php/sid/225407625|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014|publisher=''New Orleans Sun''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 2014, The US Supreme Court rejected BP's legal challenge to a compensation deal over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  The settlement agreement had no cap, but BP initially estimated that it would pay roughly $7.8bn (£6.1bn) to compensate victims.&lt;ref name="BP loses latest US oil spill appeal"&gt;{{cite news|title=BP loses latest US oil spill appeal|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30375089|date=8 December 2014|publisher="BBC News"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7004">'''Disease diffusion''' occurs when a [[disease]] is transmitted to a new location.&lt;ref name="CromleyEllen"&gt;Cromley, Ellen K. and Sarah L. McLafferty. GIS and Public Health. The Guilford Press, New York, 2002. pp. 189-209&lt;/ref&gt;  It implies that a disease spreads, or pours out, from a central source.&lt;ref&gt;Pyle, Gerald F. "Studies of Disease Diffusion." Applied Medical Geography. V.H. Winston &amp; Sons, Washington, D.C., 1979: pp. 123&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of showing the spread of disease using a [[diffusion]] pattern is relatively modern, compared to earlier methods of mapping disease, which are still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Walter, S.D. "Disease Mapping: a historical perspective." Spatial Epidemiology: Methods and Applications. Eds. P. Elliot, J.C. Wakfield, N.G. Best, and D.J. Briggs. Oxford University Press, 2000. pp. 225&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rytokonen, the goals of disease mapping are:  1) to describe the spatial variation in disease incidence to formulate an [[etiology|etiological]] hypothesis; 2) to identify areas of high risk in order to increase prevention; and 3) to provide a [[map]] of disease risk for a region for better risk preparedness.&lt;ref&gt;Rytokonen, Mike, JP. "Not All Maps are Equal:  GIS and Spatial Analysis in Epidemiology." ''International Journal of Circumpolar Health'' 63:1, 2004: pp. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Torsten Hägerstrand]]’s early work on “waves of [[diffusion of innovation|innovation]]” is the basis that many medical [[cartography|cartographers]] and [[geographer]]s use for mapping spatial diffusion (1968).&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Tom. Geographies of Disease:  Maps, Mapping, and Medicine. ESRI Press. Redlands, California, 2005. Ch. 10, pp. 249-281&lt;/ref&gt; The diffusion of disease can be described in four patterns:  expansion diffusion, contagious diffusion, hierarchal diffusion and relocation diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;Hornsby, 2000 from Cliff et al. 1981: Pyle, 1979, 137 from Gould, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Cromley and McLafferty also mention network diffusion and mixed diffusion.&lt;ref name="CromleyEllen" /&gt;

The diffusion of [[infectious disease]] tends to occur in a ‘wave’ fashion, spreading from a central source.  Pyle mentions barriers that pose a resistance towards a wave of diffusion, which include but are not limited to:  physiographic features (i.e. mountains, water bodies), political boundaries, [[linguistic barriers]], and with diseases, a barrier could be differing control programs.&lt;ref&gt;Pyle, Gerald F. "Studies of Disease Diffusion." Applied Medical Geography. V.H. Winston &amp; Sons, Washington, D.C., 1979: pp. 138&lt;/ref&gt;  The diffusion of disease can be identified as a [[normal distribution]] over time and translated into an S-shaped curve to show the phases of disease diffusion.  The phases are: Infusion (25th percentile), Inflection (50th percentile), Saturation (75th percentile), and Waning to the upper limits.&lt;ref&gt;Pyle, Gerald F. "Studies of Disease Diffusion." Applied Medical Geography. V.H. Winston &amp; Sons, Washington, D.C., 1979: pp. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease diffusion types==
[[Image:Propagation model wildfire.png|thumb|Spreading wildfire showing ''expansion diffusion'']]
*''Expansion diffusion'' occurs when the spreading phenomenon has a source and diffuses outwards into new areas, an example being a spreading [[wildfire]].
*''Relocation diffusion'' occurs when the spreading [[phenomenon]] migrates into new areas, leaving behind its origin or source of the disease.
*''Contagious diffusion'' is the spread of an infectious disease through the direct contact of individuals with those infected.
*''Hierarchal diffusion'' occurs when a phenomenon spreads through an ordered sequence of classes or places.
*''Network diffusion'' occurs when a disease spreads via transportation and social networks, "reflecting the geographical and social structuring of human interactions".&lt;ref name="CromleyEllen_a"&gt;Cromley, Ellen K. and Sarah L. McLafferty. GIS and Public Health. The Guilford Press, New York, 2002. pp. 192&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Mixed diffusion'' is a combination of contagious diffusion and hierarchal diffusion.  [[AIDS]] is a prominent example in modern-day society of a mixed diffusion disease, often spreading along the hierarchal, network, and contagious diffusion patterns.&lt;ref name="CromleyEllen_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hornsby, Kathleen. "Spatial Diffusion: Conceptualizations and Formalizations." National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis and Department of Spatial Information Science and Engineering, University of Maine, 2000: Pyle, Gerald F. "Studies of Disease Diffusion." Applied Medical Geography. V.H. Winston &amp; Sons, Washington, D.C., 1979: pp. 123-163&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of mapping and [[Geographic Information System]]s (GIS) is becoming better known to public health professionals to help link disease control to prevention efforts, which can aid in developing better immunization programs.&lt;ref&gt;Cromley, Ellen K. and Sarah L. McLafferty. GIS and Public Health. The Guilford Press, New York, 2002. pp. 194&lt;/ref&gt; GIS is an excellent tool used to identify spatial patterns and core areas of disease transmission.  Disease maps can distinguish the low and high risk areas, as well as highlight “physical and/or socio-cultural” factors that contribute to the causation of disease.&lt;ref&gt;Rytkonen, Mika, JP. "Not All Maps are Equal:  GIS and Spatial Analysis in Epidemiology." ''International Journal of Circumpolar Health'' 63:1, 2004: pp. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Understanding how a disease spreads gives health officials a better understanding of how to better serve the public.

'''DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc.''' (DFT) was a [[real estate investment trust]] that invested in carrier-neutral [[data centers]] and provided [[Colocation (business)|colocation]] and [[peering]] services.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt; In 2017, the company was acquired by [[Digital Realty]].

==Operations==

As of December 31, 2016, the company owned 11 operating data center facilities comprising over 3.3 million net rentable square feet.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt; Eight of the properties were in [[Northern Virginia]], two were in [[Elk Grove Village, Illinois]], and one was in [[Santa Clara, California]].&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;

The company leased space to companies, on a [[wholesale]] level, in which such companies rented space to build their own data centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.barrons.com/articles/the-growing-allure-of-data-center-reits-1497676056 | title=The Growing Allure of Data-Center REITs | first=TIERNAN | last=RAY | publisher=[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] | date=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company had 32 customers and derived 92% of its revenue from its 15 largest customers.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt; The company's largest customers included Microsoft (25.4% of revenue), [[Facebook]] (20.2% of revenue), [[Rackspace]] (9.0% of revenue), and [[Yahoo!]] (6.0% of revenue).&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;

==History==
The company was co-founded by Lammot J. du Pont, an analyst for [[JPMorgan Chase]] and Hossein Fateh, a real estate developer in the [[Washington metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name=founders&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2010/02/22/tidbits7.html | title=The founders of DuPont Fabros double down | first=Nick | last=Adde | publisher=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;The company sought to acquire data centers that belonged to defunct internet service providers.&lt;ref name=founders/&gt;

In 2004, the company's predecessor acquired 5 data centers from [[Savvis]] for $52 million in a [[leaseback]] transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20040308005512/en/SAVVIS-Closes-Purchase-Cable-Wireless-America-Assets | title=SAVVIS Closes Purchase of Cable &amp; Wireless America Assets | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=March 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the company's predecessor acquired a 230,000 square foot data center from [[AOL]] for $58.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/27/AR2005072702539.html | title=Tenants to Revive Vacant Data Centers | first=Jenalia | last=Moreno | publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2, 2007, the company was incorporated as a real estate investment trust.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;

In October 2007, the company became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]] that raised $640 million, the 7th largest initial public offering of a real estate investment trust at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/dupontfabros/update-1-reit-dupont-fabros-technology-ipo-raises-640-5-mln-idUSN1837411420071018 | title=REIT DuPont Fabros Technology IPO raises $640.5 mln | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=October 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2008, the company halted construction projects due to a lack of financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/realestate/commercial/10data.html | title=North Jersey Finds Popularity as Home for Data Centers | first=JOTHAM | last=SEDERSTROM | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the company was named as the fastest growing company in the Washington metro area by [[American City Business Journals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/print-edition/2014/10/31/50-fastest-growing-companiesa-win-for-the-books.html | title=50 Fastest Growing Companies: A win for the books | first=JOANNE S. | last=LAWTON | publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Mohammed Mark Amin resigned from the [[board of directors]] and was replaced by John T.

The '''first-order reliability method''', ('''FORM'''), is a semi-[[probabilistic]] [[reliability engineering|reliability analysis]] method devised to evaluate the reliability of a system.

The accuracy of the method can be improved by averaging over many samples, which is known as [[Line Sampling]].

'''Good agricultural practice''' ('''GAP''') are specific methods which, when applied to [[agriculture]], create food for consumers or further processing that is safe and wholesome. While there are numerous competing definitions of what methods constitute good agricultural practice there are several broadly accepted schemes that producers can adhere to.

==Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations GAP==
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) uses good agricultural practice as a collection of principles to apply for on-farm production and post-production processes, resulting in safe and healthy [[food]] and non-food agricultural products, while taking into account economical, social and environmental [[sustainable agriculture|sustainability]].

GAPs may be applied to a wide range of [[farming system]]s and at different scales. They are applied through sustainable agricultural methods, 
* Economically and efficiently produce sufficient ([[food security]]), safe ([[food safety]]) and nutritious food ([[food quality]]);{{cite book

 }}

GAPs require maintaining a common [[database]] on integrated production techniques for each of the major agro-ecological area (see [[ecoregion]]), thus to collect, analyze and disseminate information of good practices in relevant geographical contexts.

==United States Department of Agriculture GAP/GHP Program==
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] Agricultural Marketing Service currently operates an audit/certification program to verify that farms use good agricultural practice and/or good handling practice. This is a voluntary program typically utilized by growers and packers to satisfy contractual requirements with retail and food service buyers. The program was implemented in 2002 after the New Jersey Department of Agriculture petitioned USDA-AMS to implement an audit based program to verify conformance to the 1998 [[Food &amp; Drug Administration]] publication entitled, "Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables."

The program has been updated several times since 2002, and includes additional certification programs such as commodity specific audit programs for mushrooms, tomatoes, leafy greens, and cantaloupes.  In 2009, USDA-AMS participated in the GAPs Harmonization Initiative which "harmonized" 14 of the major North American GAP audit standards, which in 2011 resulted in the release and implementation of the Produce GAPs Harmonized Food Safety Standard.

==Smallholder productivity==
Demand for agricultural crops is expected to double as the world's population reaches 9.1 billion by 2050.  Increasing the quantity and quality of food in response to growing demand will require increased agricultural
.  Good agricultural practices, often in combination with effective input use, are one of the best ways to increase smallholder productivity.  Many agribusinesses are building sustainable supply chains to increase production and improve quality.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Finance Corporation]].  Working with Smallholders: A Handbook for Firms Building Sustainable Supply Chains.  http://www.farms2firms.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020932/http://www.farms2firms.org/ |date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soil==
{{further|Compost|Mulch|Potting soil|Organic fertilizer|Soil borne infectious diseases}}
* Reducing [[erosion]] by wind and water through hedging and ditching
* Application of [[fertilizer]]s at appropriate moments and in adequate doses (i.e., when the plant needs the fertilizer), to avoid run-off (see [[nitrogen balance method]]).
* Maintaining or restoring soil organic content, by [[manure]] application, use of [[grazing]], [[crop rotation]]
* Reduce soil compaction issues (by avoiding using heavy mechanical devices)
* Maintain soil structure, by limiting heavy tillage practices [http://www.fao.org/prods/GAP/home/principles_1_en.htm FAO : GAP : FAO GAP Principles : Soil]
* ''In situ'' green manuring by growing pulse crops like [[cowpea]], [[horse gram]], [[sunn hemp]] etc.

==Water==
* Practice scheduled [[irrigation]], with monitoring of plant needs, and soil water reserve status to avoid water loss by drainage
* Prevent soil [[Soil salinity|salinization]] by limiting water input to needs, and recycling water whenever possible
* Avoid crops with high water requirements in a low availability region
* Avoid drainage and fertilizer run-off
* Maintain permanent soil covering, in particular in winter to avoid nitrogen run-off
* Manage carefully water table, by limiting heavy output of water
* Restore or maintain wetlands (see [[marshlands]])
* Provide good water points for livestock ([http://www.fao.org/prods/GAP/home/principles_2_en.htm FAO : GAP : FAO GAP Principles : Water])
* Harvest water ''in situ'' by digging catch pits, crescent bunds across slope

==Animal production, health and welfare==
* Respect of animal well-being (freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury or disease; freedom to express normal behavior; and freedom from fear and distress)
* Avoid nontherapeutic mutilations, surgical or invasive procedures, such as tail [[docking (animal)|docking]] and debeaking;
* Avoid negative impacts on landscape, environment and life: contamination of land for grazing, food, [[water]] and [[air]]
* Check stocks and flows, maintain structure of [[system]]s
* Prevent chemical and medical residues from entering the [[food chain]]
* Minimize non-therapeutic use of [[antibiotic]]s or [[hormone]]s
* Avoid feeding animals with animal wastes or animal matter (reducing the risk of alien viral or transgenic genes, or prions such as mad cow disease),
* Minimize transport of live animals (by foot, rail or road) (reducing the risk of [[epidemics]], e.g., [[foot and mouth disease]])
* Prevent waste run-off (e.g. nitrate contamination of water tables from pigs), nutrient loss and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions ([[methane]] from cows)
* Prefer [[safety]] measures standards in manipulation of equipment
* Apply [[traceability]] processes on the whole production chain (breeding, feed, medical treatment...) for [[consumer]] security and feedback possibility in case of a food crisis (e.g., [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]).[http://www.fao.org/prods/GAP/home/principles_6_en.htm FAO : GAP : FAO GAP Principles : Animal Health and Welfare]

{{History of computing}}
This article describes the '''history of computer hardware in Bulgaria'''. At its peak, Bulgaria supplied 40% of the computers in COMECON&lt;ref name="Boyanov"&gt;{{cite book |title= Кратки сведения за развитието на изчислителната техника в България |last= Боянов|first= Кирил |authorlink= :bg:Кирил Боянов|year= 2014|publisher=Годишник на секция „Информатика“,Том 7, Съюз на учените в България |pages= 23|url=http://zit1.eu/sites/default/files/2017-02/SUB-Informatics-2014-7-01-23.pdf |language=bg|accessdate= 15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The electronics industry employed 300,000 workers, and it generated 8 billion rubles a year. Since the democratic changes in 1989 and the subsequent chaotic political and economic conditions, the once blooming Bulgarian computer industry almost completely disintegrated.

==Computer models==
In the 1980s, [[Bulgaria]] manufactured computers according to an agreement within the [[COMECON]]:

===Mainframes===
IZOT series and [[ES EVM]] series (abbreviation from Edinnaya Sistema Elektronno Vichislitelnih Machin, or Unified Computer System — created in 1969 by USSR, Bulgaria, Hungary, GDR, Poland and Czechoslovakia).

===Personal computers===
* IMKO, [[Pravetz series 8|Pravetz-82/8M/8A/8E/8C/8D]] — an 8-bit machine (Apple II clone), based on Bulgarian-made [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] variants, Pravetz-16/16A/16H/286 (16-bit) — IBM PC clones based on i8088(V20)/286.
* IZOT 1030 — based on East German-made U880 (a Z80A clone), IZOT 1036C -IBM PC compatible based on i8086, IZOT 1037C - IBM PC/XT clone based on i8088,

For example, the Pravetz-8M featured two processors (primary: Bulgarian-made clone of [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]], designated [[SM630]] at 1.018&amp;nbsp;MHz, secondary: Z80A at 4&amp;nbsp;MHz), 64&amp;nbsp;KB DRAM and 16&amp;nbsp;KB EPROM.

==Production facilities==
The largest computer factory was some {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Sofia]], in [[Pravetz]]. Another big facility was the plant "Electronika" in Sofia. Smaller plants throughout the country produced monitors and peripherals, notably DZU (''Diskovi Zapametyavashti Ustroistva'' — Disk Memory Devices) — [[Stara Zagora]] made hard disks for mainframes and personal computers.

'''Hydrodynamic separators''' (HDS) are [[stormwater]] management devices that use [[cyclonic separation]] to control [[water pollution]].  They are designed as flow-through structures with a settling or separation unit to remove [[sediment]] and other pollutants.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: Hydrodynamic Separators |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P1000ZRK.txt |date=September 1999 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |id=EPA 832-F-99-017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDS are considered structural [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs), and are used to treat and pre-treat stormwater [[surface runoff|runoff]].

== Design and applications ==
HDS systems use the physics of flowing water to remove a variety of pollutants and are characterized by an internal structure that either creates a swirling [[vortex]] or plunges the water into the main sump.&lt;ref name="Mohseni"&gt;Mohseni, Omid; Saddoris, David A.; McIntire, Kurtis D.; Gulliver, John S. (2010). [http://www.cts.umn.edu/Publications/ResearchReports/reportdetail.html?id=1890 "Hydrodynamic Separator Sediment Retention Testing."] Technical Report No. MN/RC 2010-10. St. Paul, MN: Minnesota Department of Transportation.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Along with supplemental features to reduce velocity, an HDS system is designed to separate floatables (trash, debris and oil) and settleable particles, like sediment, from stormwater. HDS systems are not effective for the removal of very fine [[suspended solids|solids]] or dissolved pollutants.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt; The systems are also subject to scour and sediment washout during large storm events, e.g. a 10-year storm.&lt;ref name="Mohseni" /&gt;{{rp|42}}

== Evaluation ==
A number of factors are relevant in selecting a hydrodynamic separator product for a site.

=== Sizing and treatment performance ===
HDS systems should be sized based on treatment objectives including desired level of pollutant removal, drainage basin characteristics, climate of the region, and particle size to be targeted. Performance is also sensitive to water temperature, i.e. season.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} Care must be taken to avoid routing excess flow through the device and compromising performance. Each vendor’s product has different pollutant removal rates that should be evaluated before selecting the system.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt;

The TAPE and TARP programs are evaluation programs sponsored by several state agencies in the U.S. These programs include lab and field testing and provide specific sizing criteria for hydrodynamic separation systems.&lt;ref&gt;State of Washington. Department of Ecology. Olympia, WA. [http://www.ecy.wa.gov/pubs/0210037.pdf Technology Assessment Protocol - Ecology (TAPE): Guidance for Evaluating Emerging Stormwater Treatment Technologies.] January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). Trenton, NJ (2007). [http://www.state.nj.us/dep/dsr/bscit/TARPMain.htm "Technology Acceptance and Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) Program."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology (NJCAT). Bordentown, NJ. [http://www.njcat.org/education/glossary.cfm "A Comprehensive Approach to Performance Verification for Stormwater Treatment Systems."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010183709/http://www.njcat.org/education/glossary.cfm |date=2008-10-10 }} Accessed 2011-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the EWRI-ASCE and the ASTM International are developing comprehensive verification guidelines and standard test methods for assessing the performance of these devices.

=== Maintenance and inspection requirements ===
HDS systems are not maintenance-intensive, when compared with land-based BMP’s.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt; Each manufactured system is different, therefore maintenance and inspection requirements should be looked at closely when purchasing an HDS system. [[Vacuum truck]]s are typically used for maintenance, so unobstructed access to accumulated pollutants for removal is critical.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

=== Installation and operating costs ===
Costs for HDS systems depend on site-specific conditions such as land characteristics, amount of runoff to be treated, system depth and performance requirements. Be aware that not all HDS systems are alike in treatment performance, and basing a decision solely on the installation and operating cost of a system may compromise system performance and the environment. Long-term maintenance costs should also be considered with overall costs when purchasing or selecting a stormwater BMP as initial installation and operating costs may not reflect the long-term investment needed to maintain the system.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt;

=== Land costs ===
According to the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), “Using structural BMPs that can be placed underground and are design to withstand site specific soil, groundwater and traffic loading conditions provide valuable savings in land area compared to conventional volume-based stormwater treatment practices such as ponds, wetlands, and swales.”&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt; HDS systems may be ideal for areas where land is not readily available and/or tight retrofits are needed as they are installed underground.

== Regulations ==
As stormwater regulations become increasingly stringent, many states and municipalities have developed criteria to govern the use and sizing of HDS systems, and publish lists that identify acceptable HDS systems.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see NJDEP list of approved [http://www.njstormwater.org/treatment.html "Stormwater Manufactured Treatment Devices."] 2011-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions evaluate the applicability of HDS on a site-specific basis.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Maryland Department of the Environment, [http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/Proprietary%202005.pdf "Maryland’s Stormwater Program &amp; Proprietary Practices."] 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It is increasingly common to use HDS as the first component of a treatment train, a combination of BMPs in series, to remove coarse solids and floatable pollutants that can rapidly clog other BMPs thus prolonging their maintenance cycle.

The company was founded in 1990 by its current CEO and Chairman Dr. Donald R. van Deventer, and as of 2018 Kamakura had served more than 330 clients in 47 countries.&lt;ref name="wire1" /&gt; [[Cornell University|Cornell]] professor [[Robert A. Jarrow]], co-creator of the [[Heath–Jarrow–Morton framework]] for pricing [[interest rate derivative]]s and the reduced form [[Jarrow–Turnbull model|Jarrow–Turnbull]] credit risk models employed for pricing [[credit derivative]]s, serve as the company's Managing Director of Research.

==Products and Services==
The company has two primary products. '''''Kamakura Risk Manager''''' (KRM), an [[enterprise risk management]] system integrating [[credit risk management including IFRS 9 and CECL]], [[market risk|market risk management]], [[asset liability management]], [[Basel II and Basel III]] and other capital allocation technologies, [[transfer pricing]], and [[performance measurement]]. '''''Kamakura Risk Information Services''''' (KRIS) is a risk portal providing data for quantitative [[credit risk]] measures such as [[default probabilities]], bond spreads, implied [[Credit spread (bond)|spreads]] and implied [[credit rating|rating]]s for corporate, sovereign and bank counterparties.  It also allows users to stress portfolios through Macro Factor Sensitivities and Portfolio Management tools. The Kamakura Troubled Company index measures the percentage of 39,000 public firms in 68 countries that have an annualized one- month default risk of over one percent.  In January 2018 the company released its Troubled Bank Index.

{{Nihongo|'''Konica Minolta, Inc.'''|コニカミノルタ|Konika Minoruta}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[technology company]] headquartered in [[Marunouchi]], [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]], [[Tokyo]], with offices in 49 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.konicaminolta.com/about/corporate/outline.html&lt;/ref&gt; The company manufactures business and industrial imaging products, including copiers, laser printers, multi-functional peripherals (MFPs) and digital print systems for the production printing market. Konica Minolta's Managed Print Service (MPS) is called Optimised Print Services. The company also makes optical devices, including lenses and LCD film; medical and graphic imaging products, such as X-ray image processing systems, colour proofing systems, and X-ray film; photometers, 3-D digitizers, and other sensing products; and textile printers. It once had camera and photo operations inherited from [[Konica]] and [[Minolta]] but they were sold in 2006 to [[Sony]], with Sony's [[Sony α|Alpha]] series being the successor [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] division brand.

==History==

===Company history===
'''Konica Minolta''' was formed by a merger between Japanese imaging firms [[Konica]] and [[Minolta]], announced on January 7, 2003 with the corporate structure completing the re-organization in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.konicaminolta.com/about/releases/minolta/2003/0107_01_01.html |title=Integration of Management between Konica Corporation and Minolta Co., Ltd. |publisher=Konica Minolta |date=January 7, 2003 |accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/0301/03010701konicaminoltamerger.asp |title=Konica and Minolta Agree on Merger |publisher=dpreview.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different group companies, such as the operations in the headquarters and national operating companies, began the process around the same time, however the exact dates vary for each group company.

Konica Minolta uses a "Globe Mark" logo that is similar, however not identical to the logo of the former Minolta company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konicaminolta.com/about/corporate/symbol_logo.html |title=Symbol Logo|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses the same corporate slogan as the former Minolta company—"The Essentials of Imaging".

On January 19, 2006 the company announced that it was quitting the camera business due to high financial losses. [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] camera service operations were handed over to [[Sony]] starting on March 31, 2006 and Sony has continued development of cameras that are compatible with Minolta autofocus lenses. Originally, in the negotiations, Konica Minolta wanted a cooperation with Sony in camera equipment production rather than a sell-out deal, but Sony vehemently refused, saying that it would either acquire everything or leave everything that had to do with the camera equipment sector of KM. Subsequently, Konica Minolta withdrew from the photo business on September 30, 2006. Three thousand seven hundred employees were laid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://konicaminolta.com/releases/2006/0119_03_01.html|title=News release details-News Releases - KONICA MINOLTA|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Konica Minolta closed down their photo imaging division in March 2007. The color film, color paper, photo chemical and digital mini-lab machine divisions have ceased operations. [[Dai Nippon Printing]] purchased Konica's Odawara factory, with plans to continue to produce paper under Dai Nippon's brand. CPAC acquired the Konica chemical factory.

Konica expanded its business presence and currently sells its products in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, and Africa.

===Camera history===

====Manual focus 35mm film SLRs====
[[File:Minolta Hi-Matic AF.jpg|thumb|215px|right|Minolta Hi-Matic auto focus]]
[[File:Konika C35 Automatic.jpg|thumb|Konika C35 Automatic Emmanuel Dissais]]
Minolta had been a competitor in the 35&amp;nbsp;mm SLR market since the development of the manual-focus (MF) SRT and other models in the mid-1960s. Minolta positioned most of its cameras to compete in the amateur market, though it did produce a very high quality MF SLR in the XD-11. Minolta's last MF SLR cameras were the X370 and X700. Shanghai Optical Co. (Seagull) purchased tools and production plant from Minolta at different times, making some X300 series for Minolta branding, and continues to release MD mount film SLRs compatible with the old system under the Seagull name.

====Autofocus 35mm film SLRs====
Until the sale of Konica Minolta's Photo Imaging unit to Sony in 2006, Konica Minolta produced the former Minolta range of 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[autofocus]] [[single-lens reflex]] [[camera]]s, variously named "[[Minolta Maxxum]]" in North America, "[[Minolta Dynax]]" in Europe, and "[[Minolta Alpha]]" in Japan and the rest of Asia. This range was introduced in 1985 with the [[Minolta Maxxum 7000]], and culminated with the professional {{Interlanguage link multi|Minolta Maxxum 9{{!}}Maxxum 9|de|3=Minolta Dynax 9}} (1997) later made in a titanium body (9Ti) and technically advanced 7 (1999). The final Minolta 35&amp;nbsp;mm SLR AF cameras were the Maxxum 50 and 70 (Dynax 40 and 60), built in China.

====Digital cameras====
[[File:Konica Minolta alvesgaspar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Dimage A200]], a [[Bridge camera|bridge-type camera]], the most sophisticated digital camera made by Konica Minolta]]
Konica Minolta had a line of digital point and shoot cameras to compete in the [[digital photography]] market. Their [[Dimage]] line (originally styled as Dimâge, later as DiMAGE) included digital cameras and imaging software as well as film scanners.

They created a new category of [[Bridge camera|"SLR-like" cameras]] with the introduction of the [[DiMAGE 7]] and [[DiMAGE 5]]. These cameras mixed many of the features of a traditional SLR camera with the special abilities of a digital camera. They had a mechanical zoom ring and electronic focus ring on the lens barrel and used an electronic viewfinder (EVF) showing 100 per cent of the lens view. They added many high level features such as a [[histogram]] and made the cameras TTL-compatible with Minolta's final generation of flashes for film SLRs. The controls were designed to be used by people familiar with SLR cameras, however the manual zoom auto-focus lens was not interchangeable. The model 5 had a 1/1.8-inch sensor with 3.3 megapixels, and the fixed zoom was equal to a 35–250&amp;nbsp;mm (relative to 24×36mm format). The Dimage 7, later 7i, 7Hi and A1 had 5-megapixel sensors for which the same lens provided 28–200&amp;nbsp;mm equivalent coverage. The later A2 and A200 increased the sensor resolution to 8 megapixels.
The Dimage 5 and 7 original models were more sensitive to infrared light than later models, which incorporated more aggressive IR sensor filters, so have become popular for infrared photography.

The A1/A2/A200 integrated a sensor-based, piezoelectrically actuated anti-camera-shake system. Before the closure of the Photo Imaging unit, the Dimâge lineup included the long-zoom Z line, the E/G lines (the G series finally incorporating former Konica models), the thin/light X line, and the advanced A line.

The '''DiMAGE G500''' was a five-[[megapixel]] [[compact digital camera]] manufactured by Konica Minolta in 2003. It comes in a [[stainless steel]] case, 3x [[zoom lens]] with a retractable barrel, and dual [[Secure Digital]] and [[MagicGate]] card slots, the camera has a 1.3-second startup time.&lt;ref name="Keller"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcresource.com/reviews/minolta/dimage_g500-review/|title=DCRP Review: Minolta DiMAGE G500|last=Keller|first=Jeff|date=2003-10-25|work=[[Digital Camera Resource Page]]|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Etchells"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/G500/G50A.HTM|title= Quick Review Konica Minolta DiMAGE G500 Digital Camera|work=The Imaging Resource|publisher=Dave Etchells|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital SLRs{{anchor|DSLR|A-mount}}====
Minolta made some early forays into digital SLRs with the [[Minolta RD-175|RD-175]] in 1995 and the [[Minolta Dimâge RD 3000]] in 1999 but were the last of the large camera manufacturers to launch a successful digital SLR camera using a current 35&amp;nbsp;mm AF mount in late 2004. The RD-175 was based on the Maxxum/Dynax 505si 35&amp;nbsp;mm film SLR and used three different ½-inch CCD image sensors—two for green and one for red and blue—supplied with images by a light splitting mechanism using prisms mounted behind the lens. The RD&amp;nbsp;3000 used [[Minolta V-mount]] APS format lenses and again used multiple CCDs—this time two 1.5&amp;nbsp;MP ½-inch sensors stitched to give a 2.7&amp;nbsp;MP output image.
It was not until late 2004 (after the merger with Konica) that they launched the Dynax/Maxxum/α 7D, a digital SLR based on the very successful Dynax/Maxxum 7 35&amp;nbsp;mm SLR body. The unique feature of this camera is that it features an in-body Anti-Shake system to compensate for camera shake. However, by 2004 Canon and Nikon had a whole range of digital SLR cameras and many serious photographers had already switched, thus leading Konica Minolta to withdraw from the market and transfer assets to Sony. The only two Konica Minolta digital SLRs to reach production before the company's withdrawal were the [[Konica Minolta Maxxum 7D|Dynax/Maxxum 7D]] and the [[Konica Minolta Maxxum 5D|Dynax/Maxxum 5D]] (which is an entry-level model that shared the 7D's sensor and Anti-Shake technology).

In early 2006 Sony announced its [[Sony alpha|Sony α (Alpha)]] line of digital SLRs, (based on Konica Minolta technology) and stated they were scheduled to launch production in the summer of 2006. The Sony Alpha 100, announced on June 6, 2006, is generally agreed to have been a Konica Minolta design based on the 5D with minimal Sony input. The range of 21 Sony lenses announced at that time also included only revisions of earlier Minolta designs, or models which had been in development, rebadged and with minor cosmetic changes. The Sony Alpha DSLR range has remained compatible with all Minolta AF system lenses, and most accessories, from 1985 onwards. 

In 2000 Minolta announced the introduction of Super Sonic Motor (SSM) focusing to a limited number of new lenses. This dispensed with a mechanical drive between camera and lens, but only SLRs made from 1999 onwards (the Dynax/Maxxum 7 and later) were compatible, the professional Dynax 9 requiring a factory upgrade to operate. Sony announced a program in 2008 to fit more future lenses with SSM and these designs may, therefore, not be compatible with 1985–1999 SLR bodies.

===Business equipment history===

====Multifunctional devices====
For some time after the merger between Konica and Minolta, both product lines continued to be sold, while research and development efforts were underway to create new products.
The first Konica Minolta badged products were almost entirely "Konica" or "Minolta" products however, as they were the next generation products being produced by both companies before the merger. These products included [[Multifunction printer|MFPs]] such as the Konica Minolta bizhub C350 (a "Minolta" design, also badged as the Konica 8022 and Minolta CF2203), and Konica Minolta 7235 (A "Konica" design).

Successive models included greater integration between the two sets of technologies, and current products such as the bizhub C451 (pictured below in this article) contain many technologies from both histories. Some products such as the bizhub 501 are more noticeably an engine design from one company rather the other, however the system itself, including operation, features and RIP technologies are i

====Printers====
As the printer operations of the former [[Konica]] company were limited to "printer models" of [[Multifunction printer|MFP]] models, or re-badged printers from other manufacturers, while the printer operations of the former [[Minolta]] company were strong since the purchase of QMS (completed in 2000&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_Sept_13/ai_65188612 Minolta/QMS final merger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527124725/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_Sept_13/ai_65188612/ |date=2009-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after increasing influence and shareholding by Minolta), printer operations were initially not affected greatly by the Konica Minolta merger. In the 1980s QMS made the KISS laser printer, the most inexpensive then available at $1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/run-magazine-36/Run_Issue_36_1986_Dec#page/n53/mode/2up|title=RUN Magazine issue 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the increased complexity of both [[Multifunction printer|MFP]] and printer devices, Konica Minolta increased technology sharing between the two lines of products. In many regions, this has led to the integration of the Printer products company into the Business equipment products company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://printerexpert.website/articles/konica-minolta-a-quick-intro|title=Konica Minolta: A Quick intro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology/cultural heritage career==
Coben is a consulting scholar and archaeologist at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] and the founder and Executive Director of the [[Sustainable Preservation Initiative]] .  His most recent work focuses on Inca imperial strategy and the archaeology of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inomata,Takeshi and Coben, Lawrence|title=Archaeology of Performance:Theaters of Power, Community and Politics|year=2006|publisher=Altamira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA|isbn=978-0-7591-0876-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He directs a multidisciplinary archaeological project in the Canete Valley of Peru and was director of a project at the monumental site of ''[[Incallajta]]'' in [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coben|first=Lawrence|title=Some Roads Do Lead to Incallajta: The Double Road from Vacas|journal=[[Ñawpa Pacha (journal)|Ñawpa Pacha]]|year=2010|volume=30|pages=53–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With [https://web.archive.org/web/20080418000830/http://anthropology.arizona.edu/people/display_fac_details.php?id=29 Takeshi Inomata], he co-authored the book [https://web.archive.org/web/20110707130228/http://www.altamirapress.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=%5EDB%2FCATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=0759108773&amp;thepassedurl ''Archaeology of Performance: Theater, Power and Community'']. [[Richard Schechner]] described this work as "an important work integrating performance theory, forensics, and classical archaeology to describe and analyze not a "dead past" but pasts that continue to operate as rich repositories of living behaviors."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schechner|first=Richard|title=Review of Archaeology of Performance|journal=TDR|date=Summer 2007|volume=51|issue=2|pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Undereiner|first=Tamara|title=Inomata and Coben's Archaeology of Performance: Theaters of Power, Community, and Politics|journal=E-misferica|date=June 2007|volume=4.1|url=http://hemi.nyu.edu/hemi/en/e-misferica-41/e41-review-inomata-and-coben-archaeology-of-performance}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coben has published articles on the Inca, archaeological site museums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= The Museums Object(ive)s.

Coben recently delivered a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVwokDAu1Qg&amp;feature=youtu.be TED talk] about alleviating poverty, empowering women and saving cultural heritage entitled "Build Futures, Save Pasts".

He also runs the aforementioned Sustainable Preservation Initiative ("SPI).   SPI preserves the world's cultural heritage by providing sustainable economic opportunities to poor communities where endangered archaeological sites are located.  SPI believes the best way to preserve cultural heritage is creating or supporting locally owned businesses whose success is tied to that preservation.  SPI's grants provide a TWO for ONE benefit:  they provide transformative economic opportunities for local residents while saving sites for future generations to study and enjoy. SPI's paradigm, designed by Coben, has been suggested by the [[Milken Institute]] as an optimal solution to preserve and develop Israel's cultural heritage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milken Release on Israeli Cultural Heritage|url=https://www.dhs.gov/sustainability-and-efficiency-task-force-membership-list}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Milken Institute|title=Cultural Heritage as an Economic Development Resource in Israel,|url=http://www.milkeninstitute.org/publications/view/456|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coben is an expert member of the ICOMOS International Scientific Committee on Archaeological Heritage Management ("ICAHM").  He is Chairman of ICAHM's Nominations Assistance Committee and Vice Chairman of its Standards Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coben ICAHM Bio|url=http://www.icomos.org/icahm/bios_coben.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804145723/http://www.icomos.org/icahm/bios_coben.html|archivedate=2013-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was recently named to the jury of the prestigious Cotsen Prize in Archaeology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cotsen Prize Jury|url=http://cotsenprize.org/jury/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022235642/http://cotsenprize.org/jury/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy career==
In addition to his academic work in archaeology, Coben has started and run numerous energy companies. He is Chairman of the Board of [[NRG Energy]], the Fortune 200 integrated electricity supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRG Board of Directors|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=121544&amp;p=irol-govboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is founder and CEO of Tremisis Energy Corporation and was CEO of Tremisis's two eponymous publicly traded affiliates.

Coben was one of the founders of Catalyst Energy Corporation, one of the nation's first alternative energy companies. Catalyst was #1 on the Inc. Magazine Fastest Growing Public Company List for the years 1982-1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1987 Inc. Magazine 100|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/19870501/5135.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange traded Bolivian Power Company, Ltd., Bolivia's largest private integrated electric generator and distributor.   He was also a director of [[Prisma Energy]] and the [[Chile]]an utility SAESA, among other companies.

Coben is also an advisor to several politicians and groups on energy policy. Ambassador [[Dick Swett]] and he wrote the national energy policy for Senator [[Joseph Lieberman]]'s [[Joe Lieberman presidential campaign, 2004|2004 presidential campaign]]. He is a member of the Department of Homeland Security's Sustainability and Efficiency Task Force&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DHS Sustainability and Efficiency Task Force Members|url=https://www.dhs.gov/sustainability-and-efficiency-task-force-membership-list}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [http://www.cleantechforobama.com/about Cleantech and Green Business for Obama]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

Coben writes the [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-coben Larry Coben energy policy and cultural heritage blog] for the [[Huffington Post]], and his own blog [http://www.energizingamerica.com Energizing America], both of which discuss major energy policy and cultural heritage issues and comment on related news from around the globe.

==={{L4}}===
{{L4}} is the Sun–Earth Lagrangian point located close to the Earth's orbit 60° ahead of Earth.

* Asteroid {{mpl|2010 TK|7}} is the first discovered "tadpole" orbit companion to Earth, orbiting {{L4}} with a mean distance of about one [[astronomical unit]].
*[[STEREO]] A (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory – Ahead) made its closest pass to {{L4|nolink=yes}} in September 2009, on its orbit around the Sun, slightly faster than Earth.&lt;ref name="NasaStereo"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/news/gravity_parking.html NASA - Join STEREO and Explore Gravitational "Parking Lots" That May Hold Secret of Moon's Origin]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[OSIRIS-REx]] passed near the L4 point and performed a survey for asteroids between 9 and 20 February 2017.

==={{L5}}===
{{L5}} is the Sun–Earth Lagrangian point located close to the Earth's orbit 60° behind Earth.

*Asteroid {{mpl|419624|2010 SO|16}}, in a horseshoe companion orbit with Earth, is currently proximal to {{L5}} but at a high inclination.
*STEREO B (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory – Behind) made its closest pass to {{L5|nolink=yes}} in October 2009, on its orbit around the Sun, slightly slower than Earth.&lt;ref name="NasaStereo"/&gt;
*The [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] is in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit drifting away c. 0.1 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] per year. In c. 2013–15 it has passed {{L5}} in its orbit.
*[[Hayabusa2]] passed near {{L5}} during the spring of 2017, and imaged the surrounding area to search for [[Earth trojan]]s in 18 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/topics/20170823/ |title=太陽−地球系のL5点付近の観測の結果について |publisher=[[JAXA]] |date=23 August 2017 |access-date=2018-06-22 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lowry Solutions''' provides [[RFID]] services, [[barcode]] and wireless networking services. Lowry also provides bar coding equipment, automatic label applicators, software, custom labels, ribbons and supplies.

Headquartered in Brighton, MI, it is partnered with companies such as [http://mpe.motorolasolutions.com/?business=E Zebra&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lowrysolutions.com/company/partners/&lt;/ref&gt;], Honeywell,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intermec.com/about_us/newsroom/press_releases/2013-08-07-US-Army-Selects-Intermec-for-pRFID-II-Contract.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Motion Computing, Panasonic and [http://www.paragonlabeling.com/company-history&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lowrysolutions.com/company/partners/&lt;/ref&gt; Paragon Labeling].

== History ==
In 1974, Richard Lowry founded a business called Lowry &amp; Associates. The company served as a Manufacturers' Rep Firm selling for Intel. Some of the items in its portfolio included single board computers, memory cards, power supplies, analog to digital I/O and Intel microprocessor development systems. Most of the computers in those days were used for test and measurement applications in R&amp;D and manufacturing environments. Lowry &amp; Associates had the exclusive regional rights to Intel systems products at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scandcr.com/index.php/2014-04-02-03-45-18/item/46-lowry-solutions-celebrates-40-year-anniversary |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714032356/http://www.scandcr.com/index.php/2014-04-02-03-45-18/item/46-lowry-solutions-celebrates-40-year-anniversary |archivedate=2015-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spartan Stores in Grand Rapids, MI, was Lowry's first bar code sale. The company saw what Lowry's team was doing in the digital printing graphics environment and was asked by Spartan if they could provide them with a bar code printing [[solution]]. At the time, Lowry &amp; Associates was reselling Printronix printers.

By 1986, Lowry sales grew to $19 million covering a four-state region. $11 million was in sales of computer peripherals and $8 million was in AIDC products and services. At that time, Lowry decided to spend more time and money on growing the AIDC side of the business. And, by 1990, Lowry Computer Products was making $19 million per year in just AIDC sales.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Between the years 1994 and 1996, Lowry grew from a regional company to national sales coverage by acquiring 4 regional VAR companies; two of those VAR Company's also had label conversion manufacturing capability.  In 1996, Lowry consolidated all manufacturing operations into their 40,000 square foot plant in White Bear Lake, Minnesota.

In 1996 Lowry began manufacturing a line of label applicators and automated print and apply systems which they still sell today under the Paragon Brand name. They offer their customers a choice of [[Zebra Technologies|Zebra]], Sato and Datamax print engines. Paragon units are installed on a global basis for some of the largest Fortune 500 companies such as P&amp;G, [[3M]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scandcr.com/index.php/2014-04-02-03-45-18/item/46-lowry-solutions-celebrates-40-year-anniversary |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714032356/http://www.scandcr.com/index.php/2014-04-02-03-45-18/item/46-lowry-solutions-celebrates-40-year-anniversary |archivedate=2015-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Lowry Computers became Lowry [[Solution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.retailsolutionsonline.com/doc/lowry-computer-products-name-change-to-lowry-solutions-nrf-0001&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Lowry Solutions was awarded the AIT-V Contract. It was one of three companies that will provide automatic identification technology data communications, software, hardware, documentation and associated services under a $181 million indefinite-delivery/indefinite quantity [http://www.govconwire.com/2015/05/army-awards-3-companies-to-share-capacity-on-auto-id-tech-contract/ contract].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4630">[[Image:Lo trau.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A ''lò trấu'' rice-husk stove]]
The '''''lò trấu''''' ("rice husk stove") is a type of versatile fuel burning [[cook stove]] used in [[Vietnam]] since the 1950s. ''Lò trấu'' comes from lò (stove) and trấu (rice husk). A kitchen with this kind of stove is a '''''bếp trấu''''', "husk kitchen."

==History and design==
The timeline of the development of the lò trấu is unclear, however it is known that the Lo Trau has been in use in Vietnam at least since the 1950s. The fixed version Lo Trau stove is thought to be strongly related to the ''Castrol stove'' design of the [[architect]] [[François de Cuvilliés]] in 1735 and similar European designs in the 1830s, with flue pipes connected to the chimney, oven holes into which concentric iron rings on which the pots were placed. Depending on the size of the pot or the heat needed, one could remove the inner rings. A recent innovation is the portable Lo Trau. Its compact design and efficient operation has been the target of a number of studies.&lt;ref name="bioenergylists.org"&gt;[http://www.bioenergylists.org/stovesdoc/IRRI/Lotrau/Lotrau.html Rice Hull Stoves - LoTrau, Mayon, IRRI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://direct.bl.uk/research/04/06/RN193014596.html British Library Direct: Order Details&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709162326/http://direct.bl.uk/research/04/06/RN193014596.html |date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.fao.org/cgi-bin/faobib.exe?rec_id=574043&amp;database=faobib&amp;search_type=link&amp;table=mona&amp;back_path=/faobib/mona&amp;lang=eng&amp;format_name=EFMON FAOBIB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repp.org/discussion/stoves/200202/msg00088.html Stoves Archive for February 2002&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reap-canada.com/bio_and_climate_3_3_1.htm Mayon Turbo Stove&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently it has been distributed in the Negros area of the Philippines in The Southern Negros Sustainable Agriculture Demonstration Projects in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="bioenergylists.org"/&gt; This relatively late uptake of apparently long-used innovation means the potential of rice husk as fuel has been overlooked by many for a long time, as well as the obscurity of the Lo Trau designs to the wider world.

[[Image:Lo trau2.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A portable lò trấu stove]]

==Operation==
The stove is started by burning easily ignited material such as bundle of coconut leaves, newspaper partially embedded in the rice husks or other fuels in the combustion chamber area. After the fire is established, the updraft air from the stove designs will quickly sustain and magnify the combustion. The rate of combustion is regulated by removing appropriate amount of ash from under the combustion area with a poker, thus enable more fuel to enter.

==Fuel==
Contrary to the name, the Lo Trau is quite versatile. It can burn wood chips, saw dust, small branches, small logs (with reduced heat controlling ability) and leaves.

== Efficiency ==
Open fire has four major disadvantages: It is dangerous, it produces much smoke, soot blackens the cookware, and the heat efficiency is poor. The enclosed design of the Lo Trau means complete combustion of the fuel, better use of the heat that it generated and thus reduce the fuel consumption by its furnace-like burning generated by the updraft through the chimney. Due to its furnace-like operation, most fuel will burned thoroughly into fine ashes with almost no waste. ''In situ'' test findings showed that it took only 5 minutes to boil water using an approximate 180g of rice husk. This figure is impressive when compared to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), fuel wood, and charcoal stoves, which required 5, 15, and 20 minutes respectively to boil the same amount of water. It should also be noted that at the present time both wood and charcoal fires are frequently ignited using kerosene, a cost that would be eliminated with the rice husk stove.&lt;ref name="bioenergylists.org"/&gt;

'''''Man and Technology: A Contribution to a Philosophy of Life''''' is a short book by [[Oswald Spengler]], in which the author discusses a [[critique of technology]] and [[industrialism]].  It was published as '''''Der Mensch und die Technik''''' in [[Munich]] in 1931.

The principal idea in the work is that many of the [[Western world]]'s great achievements may soon become spectacles for our descendants to marvel at, as we do with the [[pyramids of Egypt]] or the baths of [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Gimpel, Jean. ''The Industrial Revolution of the Middle Ages''. Penguin Books, 1976, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Spengler especially pointed to the tendency of Western technology to spread to hostile "Colored races" which would then use the weapons against the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Oswald Spengler|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l__lhQxYWdYC|publisher = Transaction Publishers|date = 1991-01-01|isbn = 9781412830348|language = en|first = H. Stuart|last = Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spengler's view, western culture will be destroyed from within by [[materialism]], and destroyed by others through [[economic competition]] and [[warfare]].

'''Manufacturing test requirement design specification''' ('''MTRD''') is a document which specifies how testing is to be implemented on a new or modified [[manufacture]]d product.  The specification includes which tests will be applied to different build processes, the percentage of coverage for each stage of those build process, and how data on errors and problems will be gathered and processed.  It would be expected to refer heavily to the organisation's [[Quality Management System]] (QMS).  

The MTRD is usually developed by the manufacturing [[test engineer]]s and presented to the program managers.  The schedules and deliverables are then reviewed by engineering, quality and operations teams and the finalized document signed off.

On 5 June 1959, the Ministry of Culture came into being with the swearing-in and appointments of ministers of the new [[Government of Singapore]]. On 1 February 1980, the Broadcasting Division of the Ministry of Culture became a statutory board, the [[Singapore Broadcasting Corporation]].

1985 saw the dissolution of the Ministry of Culture. Its Information Division came under the new Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI). Its arts promotion component was assimilated into the [[Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (Singapore)|Ministry of Community Development]] (MCD) as the Cultural Affairs Division.

Five years later, on 28 November 1990, the Information Division of the MCI and the Cultural Affairs Division of MCD, together with other associated departments and statutory boards, reunited to form the Ministry of Information and the Arts (MITA).

On 1 September 1991, the Festival of Arts Secretariat, Singapore Cultural Foundation, the Arts Division of MITA, and the National Theatre Trust merged to form the [[National Arts Council Singapore|National Arts Council]] (NAC).

On 1 October 1994, the Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA) was formed as a statutory board under MITA to oversee and promote the broadcasting industry in Singapore.

On 23 November 2001, the information and communications technology (ICT) functions under the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology came under MITA. The expanded Ministry was renamed the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, but retained the acronym MITA. In that year, [[Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore|Infocomm Development Authority]] (IDA) became one of MITA's statutory boards.

On 1 January 2003, the Singapore Broadcasting Authority, Singapore Films Commission and Films and Publications Department (previously under the MITA headquarters) merged to form the [[Media Development Authority]] (MDA). On 13 August 2004, the Ministry's acronym was changed from "MITA" to "MICA".

On 1 November 2012, MICA was renamed the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI). The move followed the restructuring of two previous ministries – MICA and the [[Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports]] (MCYS) – into MCI, the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) and the [[Ministry of Social and Family Development]] (MSF). [[REACH (Singapore)|REACH]] (Reaching Everyone for Active Citizenry @ Home) was assimilated into MCI while the resilience, arts and heritage portfolios became part of MCCY. MCI now oversees the development of the information and communications technology, media and design sectors, public libraries, and the Government’s information and public communication policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Imelda Saad|author2=S.

On 18 January 2016, MCI announced that the '''[[Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore]] (IDA)''' and the '''[[Media Development Authority]] (MDA)''' will be restructured into two new entities: '''The Infocommunications Media Development Authority (IMDA)''' and the '''Government Technology Organisation (GTO)''', in the second half of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IDA, MDA to be restructured to capitalise on converging media and ICT landscape|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ida-mda-to-be/2433768.html|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statutory boards==
MCI has 2 statutory boards:

*[[Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore|Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore]] (IMDA).
*[[National Library Board]] (NLB).

MCI also manages: 

*[[DesignSingapore Council]], a department in the ministry and the national agency for design.
*[[Cyber Security Agency (Singapore)|Cyber Security Agency]], a national agency overseeing cybersecurity strategy, operations, education, outreach, and ecosystem development.
*[[Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (Singapore)|Personal Data Protection Commission]], Singapore's primary data protection authority.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4302">Netzler &amp; Dahlgren Co AB, or NDC for short, was a Swedish company founded in 1962 by Göran Netzler and Anders Dahlgren. The initial business idea was to build customized electronics equipment. Over the years, NDC evolved into a technology platform provider (navigation, hardware, software) for AGV ([[automated guided vehicle]]) builders. [http://danaher.com Danaher] acquired NDC in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Laser Navigation System for Automatic Guided Vehicles|last = Andersson|first = Ulf|publisher = Luleå University of Technology|year = 2013|isbn = 978-91-7439-814-4|location = |pages = 11–13|url = https://pure.ltu.se/portal/files/68492310/FoRapp.U.Andersson.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== The first years ===
NDC began producing specially built electronics equipment on a small scale for a variety of industries, for example, manufacturing and marine. The number of owners grew in the 1960s to include Ingvar Bergström, Arne Nilsson and Jan Jutander.

At the beginning of the 1970s, NDC had some 30 employees and started to attract big companies such as [http://www.getinge.com Getinge], [http://www.tetrapak.com Tetra Pak] and [http://www.volvo.com Volvo]. The first AGV project was for the [[Volvo Kalmar Assembly]] plant in 1972. NDC was involved in producing the AGV prototypes but was considered too small to take on the total project. They were, however, commissioned to deliver all the drives. At that time, the Volvo plant was a revolution in the automotive industry, introducing a totally new way of working.

=== New business model ===
In 1976, Tetra Pak installed twenty AGVs in their plant in [[Lund]], Sweden. NDC provided the electronics, Tellus the mechanics and [http://www.ergodata.se/ ErgoData] the control system. The project was a success, and Tetra Pak began to introduce AGVs in their plants worldwide. NDC was involved in many AGV projects for Tetra Pak during the 1970s and 1980s, and saw its chance to expand the business into something more.

In the early 1980s, NDC made the strategically important decision to focus on creating a generic controls platform for AGV builders. Driven by the development of computer technology, it was now possible for NDC to offer the flexibility that AGV builders needed to create customized driverless vehicles. The new NDC business model was born: “Generic technology to be applied by others.”

The first partner was the French company Lamson Saunier Duval, and the number of partners quickly grew into two digits. NDC spent a lot of time educating partners on all the possibilities of generic technology.

The new business model paved the way for international expansion with NDC subsidiaries in Italy, the Czech Republic and the United States. The American NDC subsidiary, NDC Automation Inc., had its own subsidiary in Australia. NDC Automation Inc. went public on March 28, 1990, and subsequently changed its name to [https://www.transbotics.com/ Transbotics] in 2001.

=== The laser revolution ===
Laser technology took off in many industrial applications in the 1980s, and NDC started to explore the potential. In 1991, NDC introduced laser technology as AGV navigation for a Tetra Pak factory in Singapore. Tetra Pak appreciated the ease-of-change to new working patterns with laser navigation and began a worldwide plant upgrade to laser navigation. NDC named their navigation technology Lazerway.

In the 1990s, AGVs increased in complexity. By focusing on being a technology platform provider (navigation, hardware, software), NDC could stay strong in an AGV industry that had split into new categories such as [[mobile robot]]s.

=== NDC today ===
After the Danaher acquisition in 2001, NDC was named Danaher Motion and later on transformed into the [http://www.kollmorgen.com Kollmorgen] brand. The NDC brand name was kept but is now the name of the technology platform: [http://ndcsolutions.com NDC Solutions].

As of July 2016, Kollmorgen is part of  [http://www.fortive.com Fortive Corporation].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1349">'''Ocean Traveler''' was a [[drilling platform]] built in the [[United States]] and used in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In 1966, it was transferred to [[Esso]] for the first exploration wells on the Norwegian continental shelf in the [[North Sea]], following the Dutch discovery of Groningen gas field in 1959. On 16 July 1966, the platform did a limited discovery in the North Sea, in a block that much later became the discovery place of the [[Balder Field]].

Ocean Traveler had big problems with the weather conditions in the North Sea, the weather being much tougher in the North Sea than the areas off the southern coast of the United States. These experiences laid the foundation for the sister platforms, especially the Norwegian-built "Ocean Viking", which had a significantly strengthened structure.

'''Outlit''' is an online pay-per-view journalism and digital media virtual marketplace founded in 2014 in Arlington, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Bloomberg Business|title=Outlit|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=286562513|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outlit is advertisement-free for registered users and has full, native content from over 40 newspapers and magazines. Content is available by source or topic and all units of content come with a free preview. Full content can be accessed for free or through a system of micropayments. Journalists and bloggers may also publish content to sell directly to end users. Also called the "[[iTunes]] of News,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=DCInno|title=A Virginia Startup Has Launched the iTunes of News|author=Eric Hal Schwartz|date=2015|url=http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2015/05/30/dc-tech-arlington-startup-outlit-launches-itunes-of-news/|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company claims it is the largest collection of newspaper, magazine, and blog sources in a marketplace format in English. 

== History ==
The company's CEO and co-founder is Lucien Zeigler, a media consultant and economist. Zeigler has said that Outlit was founded in response to declining revenues for publishers and the prevalence of advertising in news media, as well as the "inefficiency of the [[subscription business model]]" for readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=ArlNow.com|title='Disruptive’ Media Startup to Launch Next Month|author=Ethan Rothstein|date=March 30, 2015|url=http://www.arlnow.com/2015/03/30/disruptive-media-startup-to-launch-next-month/|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outlit is backed by an undisclosed [[angel investment]] secured in March 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=DCInno|title=A Virginia Startup Has Launched the iTunes of News|author=Eric Hal Schwartz|date=2015|url=http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2015/05/30/dc-tech-arlington-startup-outlit-launches-itunes-of-news/|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Promoting adversaries''' refers to an unofficiated [[self organizing|self-organizing]] tactical relationship between opposing organizations, in which both opposing sides benefit by attacking each other. The relationship typically relies on either side never fully defeating the other, because the whole time their 'conflict' helps both sides (while each side also simultaneously takes occasional 'acceptable' losses). Promoting adversaries requires neither side to be finally defeated throughout the relationship, because both sides actually prefer the relationship to continue and thus both sides to keep existing and fighting each other.

==In military, politics, and economics==

Promoting adversaries works within a tendency where those opposed are increasingly polarized.  When the tactic is used, it has the effect of making those involved in the relationship even more extreme than they were to begin with. Fundamentalist groups become more fanatical ... and nations, agencies, militaries &amp; political parties become more repressive and [[authoritarian]] -- as the promoting adversaries drags on.

It is argued by some that the modern day guerrilla tactic of [[suicide bombing]] emerged from conditions in which one or more ''promoting adversaries'' relationships developed.

In [[George Orwell]]'s book ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', with typical or worse than typical command-economy style technological and industrial incompetence, the three remaining superpowers left in the world use high-intensity conventional total war against each other indefinitely. [[Irrationality|What reason, if any, they have for doing so is not quite clear]]. It could simply be for conquest and realpolitik in international relations. At first it appears to be for some sort of propaganda purpose, using the desperation and nationalism of the war to preserve some trace of persuasiveness of the propaganda in favor of their policies. However, that is not necessarily their actual strategy, because they have deliberately made their propaganda even more utterly unconvincing than it already is, and making sure that the population is constantly exposed to thorough and proficient, though still entirely obvious historical revision, and are exposed to introductions to Goldberg's political views for the sake of testing the population, making sure to provoke any potential dissidents into dissenting so that potential dissidents can be caught. The superpowers consider using nuclear weapons against each other's cities, not for retaliation, but for conquest, but decide to wait until they are "ready", which likely means that they do not yet consider it acceptable to finally destroy each other, perhaps because they are promoting adversaries.

==In pop culture and public relations==

This tactic is dynamically similar to certain publicity techniques, and so can be used by individuals and products seeking to gain/concentrate power or wealth as well.

Some examples include:
* [[Donald Trump]] vs. [[Rosie O'Donnell]]
* [[Paris Hilton]] vs. [[Nicole Richie]]
* [[Paris Hilton]] vs. [[Lindsay Lohan]]
* [[Keith Olbermann]] of [[MSNBC]] vs. [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] of [[Fox News]]

As well as aspects of manufactured conflict for ratings purposes on many "reality" shows on TV...

"'''Promoting Adversaries'''" has also been parodied most recently by [[Stephen Colbert]] on his show, [[The Colbert Report]], in which Stephen's brand of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream (''AmeriCone Dream'') is pitted against [[Willie Nelson]]'s brand of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream (''Country Peach Cobbler''). Of course, this public 'conflict' generates advertising for both products, which are owned by the same company.

''Promoting adversaries'' is a similar concept to the term [[frenemy]].

'''Rapid transit technology''' is [[technology]] used for public, mass [[rapid transit]]. Such transit is commonly known as a ''Metro'' or ''Subway'', and it has undergone significant changes in the years since the [[Metropolitan Railway]] opened publicly in London in 1863.

==Train size==
Some urban rail lines are built to a [[loading gauge]] as large as that of [[heavy rail|main-line railways]]; others are built to smaller and have [[tunnel]]s that restrict the size and sometimes the shape of the train compartments. One example is the [[London Underground]] which has acquired the informal term "tube train" due to its cylindrical cabin shape.

There are lines that use [[light rail]] [[rolling stock]], such as [[tram]]s or [[streetcar]]s, that are simply routed into a tunnel, onto a [[viaduct]], or other type of [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] alignment—for all or part of their route (as in [[SEPTA Subway–Surface Trolley Lines|Philadelphia]]—where the route is shared with [[Market-Frankford Subway|full-size heavy-rail trains]]). [[Railway platform height|Platforms]] at stations on these routes are apt to be built to accommodate various train sizes and not be optimal for any one size, accounting for a sizable "[[mind the gap|gap]]" between the train and the platform.

In many cities, such as [[Berlin U-Bahn|Berlin]] and [[MBTA Subway|Boston]], lines using different sizes and types of vehicles are organized into a single unified system. Although these are not often connected by track, in cases when it is necessary, rolling stock among different types of vehicles is compatible for non-revenue transfers or other purposes.{{clarify|date=March 2017}}

==Motive power==
Although initially the trains of what is now the [[London Underground]] were drawn by [[steam engine]]s, virtually all metro trains, both now and historically, use [[electric motor|electric power]] and are built to run as [[multiple unit]]s. Most trains ride on steel wheels running on two steel rails, as in a conventional railway, although some use other methods. Power for the trains, referred to as [[Traction power network|traction power]], is commonly supplied by means of a single live [[third rail]] (as in [[New York City Subway|New York]]). The current powering the trains is generally in the range of 600 to 750 [[volt]]s, although some systems, such as the ones in London and Milan, use two live rails, one positive and one negative. The practice of sending power through rails on the ground is mainly due to the limited overhead clearance of tunnels, which physically prevents the use of [[overhead lines|overhead wires]].

The use of overhead wires allows higher power supply [[voltage]]s to be used. Although overhead wires are more likely to be used on metro systems without many tunnels, an example of which is the [[Shanghai Metro]], overhead wires are employed on some systems that are predominantly underground, as in [[Barcelona metro|Barcelona]], [[Fukuoka Subway|Fukuoka]], [[Madrid Metro|Madrid]], and [[Shijiazhuang Metro|Shijiazhuang]]. Lines that utilize [[street running]] while on the surface (such as Boston's [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]]) tend to derive power completely from overhead wires, both while traveling in a tunnel in the central city and at street level in the suburban areas, as a third rail would make the track unsafe for [[road vehicle]]s, especially at [[level crossing]]s (which are found on some lines of the [[Chicago 'L']]). There are transit lines that make use of both rail and overhead power, with vehicles able to switch between the two (an example of this being in [[Rotterdam Metro|Rotterdam]] and formerly in [[Yellow Line (CTA)|Chicago]]).

The electric power is generally [[direct current|DC]] rather than [[alternating current|AC]], even though this requires large [[rectifier]]s. DC [[electric motor|motors]] were formerly more efficient for railway applications, and once a DC system is in place, converting it to AC is generally considered infeasible.

==Tracks==
[[Image:Montreal-metro.jpg|thumb|left|The rubber-tired [[Montreal Metro]] is known for its quiet trains.]]
Most rapid transit systems use conventional [[standard gauge]] [[railway track]]. Since tracks in subway tunnels are not exposed to [[rain]], [[snow]], or other forms of [[precipitation]], they are often fixed directly to the floor rather than resting on [[track ballast|ballast]], such as normal railway tracks ([[Amsterdam Metro|Amsterdam]] being an exception). Sections of the [[San Diego Trolley Blue Line|light rail system]] in San Diego, California operate on former railroad [[Right-of-way (railroad)|rights of way]] that were acquired by the [[San Diego Metropolitan Transit System|local transit agency]].

An alternate technology, using [[rubber-tired metro|rubber tires]] on narrow [[concrete]] or steel [[roll way]]s, was pioneered on certain lines of the [[Paris Métro]], and the first completely new system to use it was in [[Montreal Metro|Montreal]], Canada. On most of these networks, additional horizontal wheels are required for guidance, and a conventional track is often provided in case of [[flat tire]]s and for [[railroad switch|switching]]. There are also some rubber-tired systems that use a central [[guide rail]], such as the [[Sapporo Municipal Subway]] and the [[NeoVal]] system in [[Rennes Metro|Rennes]], France. Advocates of this system note that it is much quieter than conventional steel-wheeled trains, and allows for greater [[slope|inclines]] given the increased [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] of the rubber tires.

Some cities with steep hills incorporate [[mountain railway]] technologies in their metros. One of the lines of the [[Lyon Metro Line C|Lyon Metro]] includes a section of [[Rack railway|rack (cog) railway]], while the [[Carmelit]], in Haifa, is an underground [[funicular]].

For elevated lines, another alternative is the [[monorail]], which can be built either as supported or [[straddle beam monorail|straddle-beam monorails]] (with a single rail below the train, including the [[Tokyo Monorail]] and certain [[Chongqing Rail Transit]] lines), or as a [[suspended monorail]], where the train body hangs below the wheels and rail (a notable example being the [[Wuppertal Schwebebahn]]). While monorails have never gained wide acceptance outside Japan, there are some which are widely used. These include the [[Seattle Monorail]], which consists of one short line dating from the World's Fair of 1962, which local voters have decided against expanding. Another recently built line operates in [[Las Vegas Monorail|Las Vegas]]. An older system, also one of the first monorail systems in the United States, was installed in 1959 at [[Disneyland Monorail|Disneyland]] in California and connects the amusement park to a nearby hotel. The designer of the system, [[Walt Disney]], once offered to build a similar system between Anaheim and Los Angeles.

==Crew size and automation==
[[Image:MRT Singapur NEL Train.JPG|thumb|[[Alstom Metropolis C751A|Trains]] on the [[North East MRT Line]] in [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Singapore]], manufactured by [[Alstom]] of France, are fully automated and are not manned by any driver.]]
In the early days of underground railways, at least two staff members were needed to operated each train: one or more attendants (also called "[[Conductor (rail)|conductor]]" or "guard") to operate the doors or gates, as well as a driver (also called the "[[railroad engineer|engineer]]" or "motorman"). The introduction of powered doors around 1920 permitted crew sizes to be reduced, and trains in many cities are now operated by [[One Person Train Operation|a single person]]. Where the operator would not be able to see the whole side of the train to tell whether the doors can be safely closed, [[mirror]]s or [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit TV]] monitors are often provided for that purpose.
[[Image:Praha metro novy vlak kabina.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prague Metro]], [[Metro M1 (Prague)|M1]] driver panel]]

A replacement system for human drivers became available in the 1960s, with the advancement of [[computer]]ized technologies for [[automatic train control]] and, later, [[automatic train operation]] (ATO). ATO could start a train, accelerate to the correct speed, and stop automatically in the correct position at the [[railway platform]] at the next station, while taking into account the information that a human driver would obtain from [[railway signal|lineside]] or [[cab signaling|cab signals]]. The first metro line to use this technology in its entirety was London's [[Victoria line]], opened in 1968. In normal operation, a crew member sits in the driver's position at the front, but is only responsible for closing the doors at each station. By pressing two "start" buttons the train would then move automatically to the next station. This style of "semi-automatic train operation" (STO), known technically as "Grade of Automation (GoA) 2", has become widespread, especially on newly built lines like the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] network in the San Francisco Bay Area.

A variant of ATO, "driverless train operation" (DTO) or technically "GoA 3", is seen on some systems, as in London's [[Docklands Light Railway]], which opened in 1987. Here, a "passenger service agent" (formerly called "train captain") would ride with the passengers rather than sit at the front as a driver would, but would have the same responsibilities as a driver in a GoA 2 system. This technology could allow trains to operate completely automatically with no crew, just as most [[elevator]]s do. When the initially increasing costs for [[automation]] began to decrease, this became a financially attractive option for employers. At the same time, countervailing arguments stated that in an [[emergency]] situation, a crew member on board the train would have possibly been able to prevent the emergency in the first place, drive a partially failed train to the next station, assist with an [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]] if needed, or call for the correct [[emergency services]] ([[police]], [[fire rescue|fire]], or [[ambulance]]) and help direct them to the location where the emergency occurred. In some cities, the same reasons are used to justify a crew of two rather than one; one person drives from the front of the train, while the other operates the doors from a position farther back, and is more conveniently able to assist passengers in the rear cars. An example of the presence of a driver purely due to union opposition is the [[Scarborough RT]] line in Toronto.

Completely unmanned trains, or "unattended train operation" (UTO) or technically "GoA 4", are more accepted on newer systems where there are no existing crews to be displaced, and especially on [[light metro]] ([[Medium-capacity rail transport system|medium-capacity]]) lines. One of the first such systems was the [[Véhicule Automatique Léger|VAL]] (''véhicule automatique léger'' or "automated light vehicle"), first used in 1983 on the [[Lille Metro]] in France. Additional VAL lines have been built in other cities (such as [[Toulouse Metro|Toulouse]], also in France, and [[Turin Metro|Turin]] in Italy). Another system that uses unmanned trains is [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier's]] [[Bombardier Innovia Metro|Innovia Metro]], originally developed by the [[Urban Transportation Development Corporation]] as the [[Intermediate Capacity Transit System]] (ICTS). It was later used on the [[Vancouver SkyTrain|SkyTrain]] in Vancouver, British Columbia, which carries no crew members, and the [[Kelana Jaya Line]] in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. (The Scarborough RT uses identical trains.)

Systems which use automatic trains also commonly employ full-height [[platform screen doors]] (PSDs, alternatively called platform edge doors or PEDs) or half-height [[automatic platform gate]]s in order to improve safety and ensure passenger confidence, but this is not universal, as networks like [[Nuremberg U-Bahn|Nuremberg]] do not, using [[infrared sensors]] instead to detect obstacles on the track. Conversely, some lines which retain drivers or manual train operation nevertheless use PEDs, notably London's [[Jubilee Line Extension]] and upcoming [[Crossrail]] heavy rail line. The first network to install PSDs on an already operational system was [[MTR|Hong Kong's MTR]], followed by the Singapore MRT. Rapid transit systems in the United States do not use PEDs, except the monorail in Las Vegas and the under-construction [[Honolulu Rail Transit]] line, where their hot climates would make an uncontrolled outdoor waiting environment uncomfortable for passengers.

As for larger trains, the [[Paris Métro]] has human drivers on most lines but runs automated trains on its newest line, [[Paris Métro Line 14|Line 14]], which opened in 1998. The older [[Paris Métro Line 1|Line 1]] was subsequently converted to unattended operation by 2012, and it is expected that [[Paris Métro Line 4|Line 4]] will follow by 2019. The [[North East MRT Line]] in Singapore, which opened in 2003, is the world's first fully automated underground urban heavy-rail line. The MTR [[Disneyland Resort Line]] is also automated, along with trains on the future [[South Island Line]].

Urban [[people mover]] systems also tend to use fully automated and unstaffed trains, though to a much smaller scale. This is used in the [[Light Rail Transit (Singapore)|LRT lines of Singapore]] and [[Macau Light Rail Transit|Macau]], along with the [[Metromover]] in Miami, Florida and the [[Jacksonville Skyway]].

==Tunnel construction==
[[Image:Metro Prague Construction Works Prosek.jpg|right|thumb|Constructing a subway station ''Prosek'' in [[Prague]]]]
The construction of an underground metro is an expensive [[project]] and is often carried out over a number of years. There are several different methods of building underground lines.

In one common method, known as [[cut-and-cover]] (used in [[Early history of the IRT subway|the first New York City subway line]]), the city [[street]]s are excavated and a tunnel structure strong enough to support the road above is built in the trench, which is then filled in and the roadway rebuilt. This method (used for most of the underground parts of the [[São Paulo Metro]] and [[Guadalajara light rail system]], for example) often involves extensive relocation of [[utilities]] commonly buried not far below street level&amp;nbsp;– particularly [[electric power|power]] and [[telephone]] wiring, [[drinking water|water]] and [[natural gas|gas]] mains, and [[sanitary sewer|sewers]]. This relocation must be done carefully, as according to documentaries from the National Geographic Society, one of the causes of the April 22, 1992, [[1992 explosion in Guadalajara|explosions in Guadalajara]] was a mislocated water pipeline. The structures are typically made of [[concrete]], perhaps with structural columns of [[steel]]; in the oldest systems, [[brick]], and [[cast iron]] were used. Cut-and-cover construction can take so long that it is often necessary to build a temporary roadbed while construction is going on underneath, in order to avoid closing main streets for long periods of time. In [[Toronto rapid transit|Toronto]], a temporary surface on [[Yonge Street]] supported cars and [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar]] tracks for several years while the first segment of the [[Yonge–University–Spadina line|Yonge subway]] was built.

Some American cities, like [[Newark City Subway|Newark]], [[Cincinnati Subway|Cincinnati]] and [[Rochester Subway|Rochester]], were initially built around [[canal]]s. When the canals were replaced by railways, the builders were able to bury a subway in the disused canal's trench, without rerouting other utilities, or acquiring right-of-way piecemeal.

Another usual type of tunneling method is called [[bored tunnel|bored tunneling]]. Here, construction starts with a [[Shaft (civil engineering)|vertical shaft]] from which tunnels are horizontally dug, often with a [[tunnelling shield|tunneling shield]], thus avoiding almost any disturbance to existing streets, buildings, and utilities. But problems with [[ground water]] are more likely, and tunneling through native [[bedrock]] may require [[Rock blasting|blasting]]. (The first city to extensively use deep tunneling was [[London]], where a thick [[sedimentary]] layer of [[clay]] largely avoids both problems.) The confined space in the tunnel also limits the machinery that can be used, but specialized [[tunnel-boring machine]]s are now available to overcome this challenge.
One disadvantage with this, however, is that the cost of tunneling is much higher than building cut-and-cover systems, at-grade or elevated. Early tunneling machines could not make tunnels large enough for conventional railway equipment, necessitating special low, round trains, such as are still used by most of the London Underground, which cannot install [[air conditioning]] on most of its lines because the amount of empty space between the trains and tunnel walls is so small. Other lines were built with cut-and-cover and have since been equipped with [[London Underground S7 and S8 Stock|air-conditioned trains]].

The deepest metro system in the world was built in [[Saint Petersburg Metro|St. Petersburg]], Russia where in the [[marshland]], stable soil starts more than {{Convert|50|m|ft}} deep. Above that level, the soil mostly consists of water-bearing finely dispersed sand. Because of this, only three stations out of nearly 60 are built near ground level and three more above the ground. Some stations and tunnels lie as deep as {{Convert|100|-|120|m|ft}} below the surface. However, the location of the world's deepest station is not clear. Usually, the vertical distance between the ground level and the rail is used to represent the depth. Among the possible candidates are:
[[Image:St Petersburg Metro Sportivnaya.jpg|right|thumb|The ''[[Sportivnaya (Saint Petersburg Metro)|Sportivnaya]]'' station of the [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] [[Saint Petersburg Metro|metro]] depicts [[Ancient Greece]]; the word "sportivnaya" means "sporty" or "athletic".]]
* Deepest stations in [[Saint Petersburg Metro]], Russia:
** ''[[Admiralteyskaya (Saint Petersburg Metro)|Admiralteyskaya]]'' (''The Admiralty'', {{Convert|102|m|ft}}, opened 2011, probably the best candidate)
** ''[[Komendantsky Prospekt (Saint Petersburg Metro)|Komendantsky Prospekt]]'' (''The Commandant Avenue'', {{Convert|78|m|ft}}, opened 2005)
** ''[[Chernyshevskaya]]'' (''[[Chernyshevsky]]'', {{Convert|70|m|ft}}, opened 1958)
** ''[[Ploshchad Lenina (Saint Petersburg Metro)|Ploshad Lenina]]'' (''[[Lenin]] Square'', {{Convert|72|m|ft}}, opened 1958)
* ''[[Arsenalna]]'' station in [[Kiev Metro]], Ukraine ({{Convert|105.5|m|ft}}, opened 1960, built under a hill)
* ''[[Park Pobedy (Moscow Metro)|Park Pobedy]]'' station in [[Moscow Metro|Moscow]] (~{{Convert|80|m|ft}}, opened 2005, built under a hill)
* ''Puhung'' station in [[Pyongyang Metro]], North Korea (which doubles as a [[Nuclear fallout shelter|nuclear shelter]])
* ''[[Washington Park MAX Station|Washington Park]]'' [[MAX Light Rail]] station in Portland, Oregon (built under a hill), 260 feet (80 m)

One advantage of deep tunnels is that they can dip in a basin-like profile between stations, without incurring the significant extra costs associated with digging near ground level. This technique, also referred to as putting stations "on humps", allows gravity to assist the trains as they accelerate from one station and brake at the next. It was used as early as 1890 on parts of the [[City and South London Railway]] and has been used many times since, particularly in Montreal.

The [[West Island Line]], an extension of the [[Island Line (MTR)|MTR Island Line]] serving western Hong Kong Island, opened in 2015, has two stations ([[Sai Ying Pun Station|Sai Ying Pun]] and [[HKU Station|HKU]]) situated over {{Convert|100|m|ft}} below ground level, to serve passengers on the [[Mid-levels]]. They have several entrances/exits equipped with high-speed lifts, instead of [[escalators]]. These kinds of exits have existed in many London Underground stations and other stations in former Soviet Union nations.

[[File:Random rubble masonry.jpg|thumb|right|A rubble trench foundation]]
The '''rubble trench foundation''', an ancient construction approach popularized by architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], is a type of [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] that uses loose stone or rubble to minimize the use of [[concrete]] and improve drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, Steve (1998) ''The Alternative building sourcebook: for traditional, natural, and sustainable building products and services''. Brownfield, Me.: Fox Maple Press. p. 9. {{ISBN|1889269018}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered more environmentally friendly than other types of foundation because cement manufacturing requires the use of enormous amounts of energy. However, some soil environments are not suitable for this kind of foundation; particularly expansive or poor load-bearing (&lt; 1 ton/sf) soils.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Joseph F. (2002) ''The art of natural building: design, construction, resources''. Gabriola Island, BC: New Society Publishers. p. 111. {{ISBN|0865714339}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A rubble trench foundation with a concrete grade beam is not recommended for earthquake prone areas.&lt;ref&gt;Chiras, Daniel D. (2004). ''The new ecological home: the complete guide to green building options''. White River Junction, Vt.: Chelsea Green Pub. Co. p. 75. {{ISBN|1931498164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A foundation must bear the structural loads imposed upon it and allow proper drainage of ground water to prevent expansion or weakening of soils and frost heaving. While the far more common concrete foundation requires separate measures to ensure good soil drainage, the rubble trench foundation serves both foundation functions at once.

To construct a rubble trench foundation a narrow trench is dug down below the [[frost line]]. The bottom of the trench would ideally be gently sloped to an outlet. Drainage tile, graded 1":8' to daylight, is then placed at the bottom of the trench in a bed of washed stone protected by filter fabric. The trench is then filled with either screened stone (typically 1-1/2") or recycled rubble. A steel-reinforced concrete grade beam may be poured at the surface to provide ground clearance for the structure.

If an insulated slab is to be poured inside the grade beam, then the outer surface of the grade beam and the rubble trench should be insulated with rigid XPS foam board, which must be protected above grade from mechanical and UV degradation.

The rubble-trench foundation is a relatively simple, inexpensive, and environment-friendly alternative to a conventional foundation, but may require an engineer's approval if building officials are not familiar with it. Frank Lloyd Wright used them successfully for more than 50 years in the first half of the 20th century, and there is a revival of this style of foundation with the increased interest in green building.

{{split|Self-hosting (compilers)|Self-hosting (web services)|date=October 2017}}

'''Self-hosting''' is the use of a [[computer program]] as part of the [[toolchain]] or [[operating system]] that produces new versions of that same program—for example, a {{visible anchor|[[compiler]]}} that can compile its own [[source code]]. Self-hosting software is commonplace on [[personal computer]]s and larger systems. Other programs that are typically self-hosting include [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]]s, [[Assembly language assembler|assemblers]], [[command-line interpreter]]s and [[revision control|revision control software]].

If a system is so new that no software has been written for it, then software is developed on another self-hosting system, often using a [[cross compiler]], and placed on a [[computer storage|storage]] device that the new system can read. Development continues this way until the new system can reliably host its own development. Writing new software development tools without using another host system is rare.

== History ==
{{Main|History of compiler construction}}

The first self-hosting compiler (excluding assemblers) was written for [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] by Hart and Levin at MIT in 1962.  They wrote a Lisp compiler in Lisp, testing it inside an existing Lisp [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]. Once they had improved the compiler to the point where it could compile its own source code, it was self-hosting.&lt;ref name="LEVIN"/&gt;

{{quote|The compiler as it exists on the standard compiler tape is a machine language program that was obtained by having the [[S-expression]] definition of the compiler work on itself through the interpreter.|AI Memo 39&lt;ref name="LEVIN"&gt;{{cite web| title=AI Memo 39-The new compiler| author=Tim Hart and Mike Levin| url=ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-039.pdf| accessdate=2008-05-23}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This technique is only possible when an interpreter already exists for the very same language that is to be compiled. It borrows directly from the notion of running a program on itself as input, which is also used in various proofs in [[theoretical computer science]], such as the proof that the [[halting problem]] is undecidable.

== Examples ==

[[Ken Thompson]] started development on Unix in 1968 by writing and compiling programs on the GE-635 and carrying them over to the [[PDP-7]] for testing. After the initial Unix kernel, a [[command interpreter]], an editor, an assembler, and a few utilities were completed, the Unix operating system was self-hosting - programs could be written and tested on the PDP-7 itself.&lt;ref&gt;
Dennis M. Ritchie.
[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html "The Development of the C Language"].
1993.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the [[Linux]] kernel was initially hosted on a [[Minix]] system. When sufficient packages, like [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]], [[GNU bash]] and other utilities are ported over, developers can work on new versions of Linux kernel based on older versions of itself (like building kernel 3.21 on a machine running kernel 3.18). This procedure can also be used when building a new Linux distribution from scratch.

Many [[programming language]]s have self-hosted implementations: compilers that are both in and for the same language. Such languages include [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[BASIC]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]],&lt;ref&gt;gcc 4.8, LLVM/clang&lt;/ref&gt; [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]],&lt;ref name=dotnet&gt;Mono gmcs and [[Microsoft Roslyn]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[CoffeeScript]], [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], [[FASM]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], [[Gambas]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[HolyC]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Modula-2]], [[OCaml]], [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[PyPy|Python]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Smalltalk]], [[TypeScript]], [[Vala (programming language)|Vala]], and [[Visual Basic]].&lt;ref name=dotnet/&gt;

In some of these cases, the initial implementation was not self-hosted, but rather, written in another language (or even in [[Machine code|machine language]]); in other cases, the initial implementation was developed using [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]].

== Website management ==
In the context of website management and online publishing, the term "self hosting" is used to describe the practice of running and maintaining a website using a private web server.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wcftutorial.net/wcf-self-hosting.aspx|title=Self Hosting {{!}}|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en-US}}{{dead link|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of self hosting is mostly relevant in situations where a webmaster has a clear and immediate "hosted" alternative, however the term can be applied in other situations. A hosted solution is any service whereby an external provider is relied upon to provide a fully managed service, which might include adequate server space, on-demand support, and regular software updates.

There is often confusion as to what constitutes "self hosted" or "hosted". The key distinction lies in the amount of control a webmaster has over the web property. A good example of the self hosting vs. hosted dichotomy would be [[WordPress]], a widely used, free and open-source [[content management system]] (CMS). A webmaster could choose to use either [[WordPress.com]], which is a largely free service maintained by the company [[Automattic]], or alternatively download the underlying WordPress software from WordPress.org. The latter option would enable the webmaster to install the WordPress software manually on his or her own private web server, whether that server is leased from a web hosting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.criticthoughts.com/hosting/best-web-hosting-services/|title=Best Web Hosting Services in 2018 - CriticsThoughts.com|date=2018-02-06|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; provider or set up in house. In summary, WordPress.com can serve as a hosted alternative, whereas WordPress.org could constitute as self hosting.

Some services like [[Shopify]] could also constitute as "hosted" services. Shopify is an example of a [[Software as a service|SaaS]]-based [[E-commerce|ecommerce]] platform, which offers customers a fully managed service, including proprietary website-building software, on-demand support, and server space/hosting. Since the Shopify software is proprietary and not open source, there is no "self hosting" alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shopify.co.uk/faq/how-do-i-install-shopify|title=Ecommerce Software – How do I install Shopify?|website=Shopify|language=EN|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2990">'''Self-service software''' is a subset within the [[knowledge management]] software category and which contains a range of software that specializes in the way information, process rules and logic are collected, framed within an organized taxonomy, and accessed through decision support interviews. Self-service software allows people to secure answers to their inquiries and/or needs through an automated interview fashion instead of traditional search approaches.

== Self-service software functionality ==
Self-service software allows authors (typically subject-matter experts) to readily automate the deployment of, the timeliness of, and compliance around a variety of processes with which they are involved in communicating without having to physically address the questions, needs, and solicitations of end-users who are inquiring about the particular process being automated. 

Self-service software primarily addresses closed-loop inquiries whereby the author emulates a variety of known (finite) questions and related (known) responses on hand or required steps that must be addressed to derive and deliver a final answer or directive.  Often the author using such software codifies such known processes and steps then generates (publishes) end-user facing applications which can encompass a variety of code bases and platforms.

Self-service software is sometimes referred to decision support software and even expert systems.  It is typically categorized as a subtopic within the [[knowledge management software]] category.  Self-service software allows individuals and companies alike to tailor and address customer support, technical support and employee support inquiries and needs in an on-demand fashion where the person with a question (need) can interface with the author's generated application via a computer, a handheld device, a kiosk, register, or other machine type to secure their answers as if they were directly interacting (talking to) the author.

Some self-service software is able to handle automatic execution of processes. An approval process can also be added to the workflow. For instance, to give managers the possibility to keep track of the cost related to the ordered services by employees.

A '''solid oxide electrolyzer cell''' (SOEC) is a [[solid oxide fuel cell]] that runs in [[Regenerative fuel cell|regenerative mode]] to achieve the [[electrolysis of water]] (and/or carbon dioxide)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=Yun|last2=Wang|first2=Jianchen|last3=Yu|first3=Bo|last4=Zhang|first4=Wenqiang|last5=Chen|first5=Jing|last6=Qiao|first6=Jinli|last7=Zhang|first7=Jiujun|title=A review of high temperature co-electrolysis of H                            O and CO                            to produce sustainable fuels using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs): advanced materials and technology|journal=Chem.

Rev.|date=2017|volume=46|issue=5|pages=1427–1463|doi=10.1039/C6CS00403B|pmid=28165079}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using a solid oxide, or [[ceramic]], [[electrolyte]] to produce [[hydrogen gas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/reports/ris-r-1608_327-338.pdf Durability of solid oxide electrolysis cells for hydrogen production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711161522/http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/reports/ris-r-1608_327-338.pdf |date=2009-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (and/or [[carbon monoxide]]) and oxygen.
The production of pure hydrogen is compelling because it is a clean fuel that can be stored easily, thus making it a potential alternative to batteries, which have a low storage capacity and create high amounts of waste materials.&lt;ref&gt;Ni M, Leung MKH, Leung DYC, Sumathy K. A review and recent developments in photocatalytic water-splitting using TiO2 for hydrogen production. Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev 2007;11(3):401–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Electrolysis is currently the most promising method of hydrogen production from water due to high efficiency of conversion and relatively low required energy input when compared to thermochemical and photocatalytic methods.&lt;ref&gt;Ni, M., Leung, M. K. H., &amp; Leung, D. Y. C. (2008). Technological development of hydrogen production by solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC). International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 33, 2337–2354. doi:10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.02.048&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
Solid oxide electrolyzer cells operate at temperatures which allow [[high-temperature electrolysis]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress06/ii_a_2_tao.pdf A reversible planar solid oxide fuel-assisted electrolysis cell]&lt;/ref&gt; to occur, typically between 500 and 850&amp;nbsp;°C. These [[operating temperature]]s are similar to those conditions for an [[SOFC]]. The net cell reaction yields hydrogen and oxygen gases. The reactions for one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of water are shown below, with [[oxidation]] of water occurring at the [[anode]] and [[redox|reduction]] of water occurring at the [[cathode]].

Anode: O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → 1/2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Cathode: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

Net Reaction: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Electrolysis of water at 298 K (25&amp;nbsp;°C) requires 285.83 kJ of energy per mole in order to occur,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/electrol.html Electrolysis of Water]&lt;/ref&gt; and the reaction is increasingly endothermic with increasing temperature. However, the energy demand may be reduced due to the [[Joule heating]] of an electrolysis cell, which may be utilized in the [[water splitting]] process at high temperatures. Research is ongoing to add heat from external heat sources such as [[solar power|concentrating solar thermal collectors]] and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319906005829 Can high temperature steam electrolysis function with geothermal heat?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The general function of the electrolyse cell is to split water in the form of steam into pure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Steam is fed into the porous cathode. When a voltage is applied, the steam moves to the cathode-electrolyte interface and is reduced to form pure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and oxygen ions. The hydrogen gas then diffuses back up through the cathode and is collected at its surface as hydrogen fuel, while the oxygen ions are conducted through the dense electrolyte. The electrolyte must be dense enough that the steam and hydrogen gas cannot diffuse through and lead to the recombination of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. At the electrolyte-anode interface, the oxygen ions are oxidized to form pure oxygen gas, which is collected at the surface of the anode.&lt;ref&gt;Ni, M., Leung, M. K. H., &amp; Leung, D. Y. C. (2008). Technological development of hydrogen production by solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC). International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 33, 2337–2354. doi:10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.02.048&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Solid oxide electrolyzer cells follow the same construction of a solid-oxide fuel cell, consisting of a fuel electrode (cathode), an oxygen electrode (anode) and a solid-oxide electrolyte.

===Electrolyte===
The most common electrolyte, again similar to solid-oxide fuel cells, is a dense ionic conductor consisting of ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; doped with 8&amp;nbsp;mol % Y2O3 (also knows as YSZ). Zirconia dioxide is used because of its high strength, high melting temperature (approximately 2700&amp;nbsp;°C) and excellent corrosion resistance. Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is added to mitigate the phase transition from the tetragonal to the monoclinic phase on rapid cooling, which can lead to cracks and decrease the conductive properties of the electrolyte by causing scattering.&lt;ref&gt;Bocanegra-Bernal, M. H., &amp; De la Torre, S. D. (2002). Phase transitions in zirconium dioxide and related materials for high performance engineering ceramics. Journal of Materials Science, 37, 4947–4971&lt;/ref&gt; Some other common choices for SOEC are Scandia stabilized zirconia (ScSZ), ceria based electrolytes or lanthanum gallate materials. Despite the material similarity to solid oxide fuel cells, the operating conditions are different, leading to issues such as high steam concentrations at the fuel electrode and high oxygen partial pressures at the electrolyte/oxygen electrode interface.&lt;ref&gt;Laguna-Bercero, M. A. Recent advances in high temperature electrolysis using solid oxide fuel cells: A review. Journal of Power Sources 2012, 203, 4–16 DOI: 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.12.019.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study found that periodic cycling a cell between electrolyzer and fuel cell modes reduced the oxygen partial pressure build up and drastically increased the lifetime of the electrolyzer cell.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, C.; Ebbesen, S. D.; Jensen, S. H.; Simonsen, S. B.; Mogensen, M. B. Eliminating degradation in solid oxide electrochemical cells by reversible operation. Nat Mater 2014, advance online publication.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel Electrode (Cathode)===
The most common fuel electrode material is a Ni doped YSZ, however, high steam partial pressures and low hydrogen partial pressures at the Ni-YSZ interface caused oxidation of the nickel and lead to irreversible degradation.&lt;ref&gt;Laguna-Bercero, M. A. Recent advances in high temperature electrolysis using solid oxide fuel cells: A review. Journal of Power Sources 2012, 203, 4–16 DOI: 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.12.019.&lt;/ref&gt; Perovskite-type lanthanum strontium manganese (LSM) is also commonly used as a cathode material. Recent studies have found that doping LSM with scandium to form LSMS promotes mobility of oxide ions in the cathode, increasing reduction kinetics at the interface with the electrolyte and thus leading to higher performance at low temperatures than traditional LSM cells. However, further development of the sintering process parameters is required to prevent precipitation of scandium oxide into the LSM lattice. These precipitate particles are problematic because they can impede electron and ion conduction. In particular, the processing temperature and concentration of scandium in the LSM latice are being researched to optimize the properties of the LSMS cathode.&lt;ref&gt;Yue, X., Yan, A., Zhang, M., Liu, L., Dong, Y., &amp; Cheng, M. (2008). Investigation on scandium-doped manganate La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xScxO3-cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells. Journal of Power Sources, 185, 691–697. doi:10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.08.038&lt;/ref&gt; New materials are being researched such as lanthanum strontium manganese chromate (LSCM), which has proven to be more stable under electrolysis conditions.&lt;ref&gt;X. Yang, J.T.S. Irvine, J. Mater. Chem. 18 (2008) 2349–2354.&lt;/ref&gt; LSCM has high redox stability, which is crucial especially at the interface with the electrolyte. Scandium-doped LCSM (LSCMS) is also being researched as a cathode material due to its high ionic conductivity. However, the rare-earth element introduces a significant materials cost and was found to cause a slight decrease in overall mixed conductivity. Nonetheless, LCSMS materials have demonstrated high efficiency at temperatures as low as 700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, S., Xie, K., Dong, D., Li, H., Qin, Q., Zhang, Y., &amp; Wu, Y. (2015). A composite cathode based on scandium-doped chromate for direct high-temperature steam electrolysis in a symmetric solid oxide electrolyzer. Journal of Power Sources, 274, 718–729. doi:10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.103&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxygen Electrode (Anode)===
Lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM) is the most common oxygen electrode material. LSM offers high performance under electrolysis conditions due to generation of oxygen vacancies under anodic polarization that aid oxygen diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;W. Wan, S.P. Jiang, Solid State Ionics 177 (2006) 1361–1369.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, impregnating LSM electrode with GDC nanoparticles was found to increase cell lifetime by preventing delamination at the electrode/electrolyte interface.&lt;ref&gt;K. Chen, N. Ai, S.P. Jiang, J. Electrochem. Soc. 157 (2010) P89–P94.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact mechanism by how this happen needs to be explore further. In a 2010 study, it was found that neodymium [[nickelate]] as an anode material provided 1.7 times the current density of typical LSM anodes when integrated into a commercial SOEC and operated at 700&amp;nbsp;°C, and approximately 4 times the current density when operated at 800&amp;nbsp;°C. The increased performance is postulated to be due to higher "overstoichimoetry" of oxygen in the neodymium nickelate, making it a successful conductor of both ions and electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Chauveau, F., Mougin, J., Bassat, J. M., Mauvy, F., &amp; Grenier, J. C. (2010). A new anode material for solid oxide electrolyser: The neodymium nickelate. Journal of Power Sources, 195, 744–749. doi:10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations==
Advantages of solid oxide-based regenerative fuel cells include high efficiencies, as they are not limited by [[Carnot efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2010/EE/B915927D Intermediate temperature solid oxide electrolysis cell using LaGaO3 based perovskite electrolyte]&lt;/ref&gt;
Additional advantages include long-term stability, fuel flexibility, low emissions, and low operating costs. However, the greatest disadvantage is the high [[operating temperature]], which results in long start-up times and break-in times. The high operating temperature also leads to mechanical compatibility issues such as [[thermal expansion]] mismatch and chemical stability issues such as [[diffusion]] between layers of material in the cell&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/fuecel/overview.php Solid oxide fuel cells]&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, the process of any fuel cell could be reversed, due to the inherent reversibility of chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed073p837.1 Simple and Attractive Demonstration of the Reversibility of Chemical Reactions]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a given [[fuel cell]] is usually optimized for operating in one mode and may not be built in such a way that it can be operated in reverse. Fuel cells operated backwards may not make very efficient systems unless they are constructed to do so such as in the case of  solid oxide electrolyzer cells, [[High pressure electrolysis|high pressure electrolyzers]], [[unitized regenerative fuel cell]]s and [[regenerative fuel cell]]s. However, current research is being conducted to investigate systems in which a solid oxide cell may be run in either direction efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecsdl.org/vsearch/servlet/VerityServlet?KEY=ECSTF8&amp;smode=strresults&amp;sort=rel&amp;maxdisp=25&amp;threshold=0&amp;pjournals=ECSTF8&amp;possible1zone=article&amp;possible4=barnett&amp;possible4zone=author&amp;bool4=and&amp;OUTLOG=NO&amp;viewabs=ECSTF8&amp;key=DISPLAY&amp;docID=3&amp;page=1&amp;chapter=0 A Proposed Method for High Efficiency Electrical Energy Storage Using Solid Oxide Cells]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delamination===
Fuel cells operated in electrolysis mode have been observed to degrade primarily due to anode delamination from the electrolyte. The delamination is a result of high oxygen partial pressure build up at the electrolyte-anode interface. Pores in the electrolyte-anode material act to confine high oxygen partial pressures inducing stress concentration in the surrounding material. The maximum stress induced can be expressed in terms of the internal oxygen pressure using the following equation from fracture mechanics: &lt;ref&gt;Courtney, T.N. (2000) ''Mechanical Behavior of Materials''. Groveland, IL: Waveland Press&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{max}=2P_{O2}(\frac{c}{\rho})^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

where c is the length of the crack or pore and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of curvature of the crack or pore. If &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{max}&lt;/math&gt; exceeds the theoretical strength of the material, the crack will propagate, macroscopically resulting in delamination.

Virkar et al. created a model to calculate the internal oxygen partial pressure from the oxygen partial pressure exposed to the electrodes and the electrolyte resistive properties.&lt;ref&gt;Virkar, A.V. (2010). "Mechanism of oxygen electrode delamination in solid oxide
electrolyzer cells" International Journal of Hydrogen Energy '''35''': 9527-9543&lt;/ref&gt;.The internal pressure of oxygen at the electrolyte- anode interface was modelled as:

:&lt;math&gt; P^{a}_{O2} =  P^{Ox}_{O2} \exp \left[-\frac{4F}{RT} \left\{\frac{E_{a} r^{a}_{e}}{R_{e}} - \frac{(E_{a} - E_{N})r^{a}_{i}}{R_{i}}\right\}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; =P^{Ox}_{O2} \exp \left[-\frac{4F}{RT} \left\{(\phi^{Ox} - \phi^a) - \frac{(E_{a} - E_{N})r^{a}_{i}}{R_{i}}\right\}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{O2}^{Ox}&lt;/math&gt; is the oxygen partial pressure exposed to the oxygen electrode (anode), &lt;math&gt;r-e^a&lt;/math&gt; is the area specific electronic resistance at the anode interface, &lt;math&gt;r_i^a&lt;/math&gt; is the area specific ionic resistance at the anode interface, &lt;math&gt;E_a&lt;/math&gt; is the applied voltage, &lt;math&gt;E_N&lt;/math&gt; is the Nernst potential, &lt;math&gt;R_e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; are the overall electronic and ionic area specific resistances respectively, and &lt;math&gt;\phi^{Ox}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi^a&lt;/math&gt; are the electric potentials at the anode surface and the anode electrolyte interface respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Virkar, A.V. (2010). "Mechanism of oxygen electrode delamination in solid oxide
electrolyzer cells" International Journal of Hydrogen Energy '''35''': 9527-9543&lt;/ref&gt; 

In electrolysis mode &lt;math&gt;\phi^{Ox}&lt;/math&gt;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\phi^a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_a&lt;/math&gt;&gt;&lt;math&gt;E_N&lt;/math&gt;. Whether &lt;math&gt;P_{O2}^a&lt;/math&gt; is greater than &lt;math&gt;P_{O2}^{Ox}&lt;/math&gt; is dictated by whether (&lt;math&gt;\phi^{Ox}&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;\phi^a&lt;/math&gt; ) or &lt;math&gt;\frac{E_a r_e^a}{R_e}&lt;/math&gt;  is greater than &lt;math&gt;\frac{(E_a- E_N ) r_i^a}{R_i}&lt;/math&gt; .  The internal oxygen partial pressure is minimized by increasing the electronic resistance at the anode interface and decreasing the ionic resistance at anode interface. 

Delamination of the anode from the electrolyte increases the resistance of the cell and necessitates higher operating voltages in order to maintain a stable current.&lt;ref&gt;Gazzarri J.I., Kesler O. (2007) “Non-destructive delamination detection in solid oxide fuel cells”. Journal of Power Sources; '''167''': 430-441.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher applied voltages increases the internal oxygen partial pressure, further exacerbating the degradation.

==Applications==
SOECs have possible application in fuel production, carbon dioxide recycling, and chemicals synthesis. In addition to the production of hydrogen and oxygen, an SOEC could be used to create [[syngas]] by electrolyzing water vapor and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceramatec.com/technology/ceramic-solid-state-ionic-technologies/syngas-production/solid-oxide-electrolysis-cell.php Ceramatec Solid Oxide Co-Electrolysis Cell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608103131/http://www.ceramatec.com/technology/ceramic-solid-state-ionic-technologies/syngas-production/solid-oxide-electrolysis-cell.php |date=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This conversion could be useful for energy generation and energy storage applications.

[[MIT]] will test the method on the [[Mars 2020 rover]] mission as a means to produce oxygen for both human sustenance and liquid oxygen rocket propellant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/going-red-planet MOXIE - An MIT oxygen-creating instrument has been selected to fly on the upcoming Mars 2020 mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sonic soot blowers''' offer a cost-effective and non-destructive means of preventing [[Incinerator bottom ash|ash]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] build-up within the [[power generation]] industry. They use high energy – low frequency [[sound wave]]s that provide 360° particulate de-bonding and at a speed in excess of 344 metres per second. Because they employ non-destructive sound waves, unlike steam [[soot blower]]s they eliminate any concerns over [[corrosion]], [[erosion]] or mechanical damage and do not produce an [[effluent stream]].



The sonic soot blower can in some ways be compared to a musical [[Reed (instrument)|reed instrument]] such as an [[oboe]], where the ‘base tone’ is created by blowing air over a reed and then converting this ‘base tone’ into a particular high or low note, depending on how far the sound wave has to travel along inside the body of the instrument.

The sonic soot blower operates in the same manner, the ‘base tone’ being produced by passing [[compressed air]] into a wave generator which houses a [[titanium]] diaphragm causing it to oscillate rapidly. This ‘base tone’ is then converted into a range of selected frequencies ranging from 350&amp;nbsp;Hz down to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz by the design and length of the [[horn section]], producing the desired [[sound frequency]] at a sound level approaching 200 dB. The sonic soot blower is usually ‘sounded’ for a few seconds at intervals of between 3 and 10 minutes. This ‘sounding’ pattern is normally controlled via the plant’s PLC. However, it may also be operated by such means as a [[SCADA]] system, individual timers on each [[solenoid valve]] or via a manual [[ball valve]].

==Construction==

Sonic soot blowers are normally constructed from fabricated, 316 grade [[stainless steel]] as opposed to some [[sonic horn]]s which are manufactured from heavy [[cast iron]].   For installations in harsher environments, such as high temperature or acidic gas streams, other types of stainless steels are used such as 310, 316 and 825.

==Performance==

Sonic soot blowers create a rapid series of very powerful sound induced pressure fluctuations which when transmitted into the ash or particulate, cause them to de-bond from other particles and from the [[heat transfer]] surface to which they are bonded and so carried away in the gas stream. This prevents the ash from building up and [[sintering]] onto the [[boiler]] tubes thus significantly reducing [[thermal efficiency]]. This is in contrast to the operating principles of steam soot blowers which are usually only employed at most once every eight hours by which time the ash has built up and baked hard onto the heat transfer surfaces. The steam soot blower then tries to blast away his hard deposit, usually only from the leading edge of the steam tubes.

==Advantages==

Sonic soot blowers are a proven alternative to conventional steam soot blowers in power generation plants which burn a range of [[fossil fuel]]s and other waste fuels including [[biofuel]]s. Depending on the application and boiler plant design, sonic soot blowers usually totally replace existing high maintenance steam soot blowers whether of the retractable or rotary type. In a few cases, sonic soot blowers can be used to supplement steam soot blowers.
Sonic soot blower cleaning technologies can be applied in [[superheater]]s, generating sections, [[economizer]]s, and airheaters as well as downstream equipment such as [[electrostatic precipitator]]s, [[Baghouse#Fabric_filters|baghouse filters]] and fans.

The main advantages of sonic soot blowers over [[Soot blower|steam soot blowers]] are:-

•	Elimination of opacity spikes due to more regular, more efficient cleaning
•	No structural damage to tube bundles or boiler structure
•	Elimination of tube corrosion and erosion problems
•	360° cleaning of all tube surfaces – not harsh leading edge tube cleaning as with steam soot blowers
•	Prevention of ash build up and sintering on steam tubes due to sonic soot blowers regular operation
•	Extremely low maintenance or operational costs
•	Eco-friendly – helps to combat global [[climate change]] and the effect of [[global warming]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5187">A '''subtitle editor''' is a type of software used to create and edit [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] to be superimposed over, and synchronized with, video. Such editors usually provide video preview, easy entering/editing of text, start, and end times, and control over text formatting and positioning.  Subtitle editors are available as standalone applications, as components of many [[video editing]] software suites, and as web applications.&lt;!--This article focuses on the subtitle editing features and capabilities, not video editing.--&gt;

==Purpose==
In television, subtitles are used for "clarification, translation, services for the deaf, as well as identifying places or people in the news." In movies, subtitles are mainly used for translations from foreign languages.&lt;ref name="Cotrell"&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephanie |last=Cottrell Bryant |year=2006 |title= Videoblogging for Dummies |publisher=[[For Dummies]] |page=139 |isbn=978-0-471-97177-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DoTgSG9Js4C&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=subtitles+for+dummies&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JN1lTO36LIrSsAP2iNn6DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=subtitles&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Subtitles are frequently used to provide informative details regarding the action on screen, such as the names and titles of interview subjects,&lt;ref&gt;Cotrell Bryant, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; a discussion topic change, to spell out web URLs or email addresses, to assist understanding speakers who mumble, details in instructional videos such as recipe ingredients, and humorous effects such as commentary or contradictory captions.&lt;ref&gt;Cotrell Bryant, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

Each subtitle, during editing, consists of text, a start time, an end time or duration, and optional text styling and positioning.&lt;ref name="Sahlin"&gt;Sahlin, Doug (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=cc2myDDoVPYC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=subtitle+tutorial&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PfBlTITLK5K8sAPh-rW_DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=28&amp;ved=0CMwBEOgBMBs#v=onepage&amp;q=subtitle%20tutorial&amp;f=false How to do everything with Adobe Encore DVD].  [[McGraw-Hill]] Osborne Media. p. 262. {{ISBN|978-0-07-223190-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Time is measured either in video frames, in milliseconds, or in hours:minutes:seconds.frames/milliseconds. The exact format and separator characters(colon, period, comma, etc.) are determined by the subtitle format chosen.  A capable subtitle editor can convert one time measurement system into another without error.

==Editor features==
A subtitle editing tool will typically have these features:
* Capable of displaying a variety of video formats, loading and saving a wide variety of subtitle file formats
* Video preview: simultaneous, synchronized playback of video and subtitles, with pause/play and fine adjustment over video: jog/shuttling/slow-motion
* Text entry and editing
** Search and replace of text to correct names, etc.
** [[Spell check]]
** Change text encoding for UTC-8, Unicode, etc.
* Change the duration of a given subtitle's display
* Shift subtitles or a block of subtitles back and forth in time
* Change subtitle format ([[MicroDVD]], [[MPSub]], [[SubRip]], ...)
* Changing the time base [[frame rate]] 24, 25, 29.995, 30, etc.

Editors used by broadcasters may have additional features:
* Speech to text functionality, either for creation of offline subtitles, or for live respeaking
* Manual cue - allowing the user to manually 'play out' a subtitles to a range of output devices
* Live subtitling - where subtitles are created in real time for a live programme, usually via some fast typing method (e.g. steno, shortforms, or respeaking, and the subtitles are fed to external systems for transmission with the programme.  
See [[Subtitle (captioning)|the general description of subtitles]] for further description.

Not all editors are equally flexible in terms of video formats, subtitle formats, or ease of use.

== Examples of subtitle editors ==
* [[Aegisub]] - Free. GNU/Linux, OS X, Windows.
* [[Amara (subtitling)|Amara]], Free.
* [[Gnome Subtitles]] - Free.
* [[Subtitle Edit]] - Free and Open Source under GPL License.

[[File:Temperature measuring and controlling module Nov.5,2013.jpg|thumb|300px|Temperature measuring and controlling module for microcontroller experiment]]
'''Temperature control''' is a process in which change of temperature of a space (and objects collectively there within) is  measured or otherwise detected, and the passage of heat energy into or out of the space is adjusted to achieve a desired average temperature. 

Air-conditioners, space-heaters, refrigerators, water-heaters, etc. are examples of devices that perform temperature control. These are often broadly classified as Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs). 

== Control loops ==

A home [[thermostat]] is an example of a closed control loop: It constantly assesses the current room temperature and controls a heater and/or air conditioner to increase or decrease the temperature according to user-defined setting(s). A simple (low-cost, cheap) thermostat merely switches the heater or air conditioner either on or off, and temporary overshoot and undershoot of the desired average temperature must be expected. A more expensive thermostat varies the amount of heat or cooling provided by the heater or cooler, depending on the difference between the required temperature (the "setpoint") and the actual temperature. This minimizes over/undershoot. This method is called [[Proportional control]].  Further enhancements using the accumulated error signal ([[Integral]]) and the rate at which the error is changing ([[Derivative]]) are used to form more complex [[PID controller|PID Controllers]] which is the form usually seen in industry.

== Energy balance ==

An object's or space's temperature increases when heat energy moves into it, increasing the average kinetic energy of its atoms, e.g., of things and air in a room.  Heat energy leaving an object or space lowers its temperature.  Heat flows from one place to another (always from a higher temperature to a lower one) by one or more of three processes: [[heat conduction|conduction]], [[convection]] and [[radiation]]. In conduction, energy is passed from one atom to another by direct contact. In convection, heat energy moves by conduction into some movable fluid (such as air or water) and the fluid moves from one place to another, carrying the heat with it.  At some point the heat energy in the fluid is usually transferred to some other object by means conduction again.  The movement of the fluid can be driven by negative-buoyancy, as when cooler (and therefore denser) air drops and thus upwardly displaces warmer (less-dense) air ([[natural convection]]), or by fans or pumps ([[forced convection]]).  In radiation, the heated atoms make electromagnetic emissions absorbed by remote other atoms, whether nearby or at astronomical distance. For example, the Sun radiates heat as both invisible and visible electromagnetic energy. What we know as "light" is but a narrow region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

If, in a place or thing, more energy is  received than is lost, its temperature increases.  If the amount of energy coming in and going out are exactly the same, the temperature stays constant—there is thermal balance, or thermal equilibrium.

'''Walter S. Mossberg''' (born March 27, 1947) is an [[United States|American]] journalist. He is widely credited with pioneering the modern, consumer-focused, technology review and commentary.

From 1991 through 2013, he was the principal technology columnist for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. He also co-founded ''[[AllThingsD]]'', [[Recode.net|''Recode'']] and the [[All Things Digital|D]] and [[Recode|Code Conferences.]] From 2015 to 2017, Mossberg was Executive Editor of ''[[The Verge]]'' and Editor-at-Large of ''[[Recode]]'', web sites owned by [[Vox Media]]. Mossberg wrote a weekly column for both and also had a weekly podcast, Ctrl-Walt-Delete. Mossberg was also co-executive producer of the annual Code Conference. He retired in July 2017.

Dow Jones announced on September 19, 2013, that Mossberg would leave ''The Wall Street Journal'' as part of the breakup with [[All Things Digital|AllThingsD]] by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hagey |first1=Keach  |last2=Launder |first2=William |date=Sep 19, 2013 |title=Tech Columnist Walt Mossberg to Leave WSJ: |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323308504579085663273991706 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; AllThingsD was a technology conference and web site owned by Dow Jones but created and operated by Mossberg and [[Kara Swisher]]. Along with other reporters from AllThingsD, Mossberg and Swisher started a new media site called ''[[Re/code|Recode]]'' in 2014, which was acquired by [[Vox Media]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="recode"/&gt;

In April 2017, Mossberg announced his plans to retire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mossberg|first=Walt|title=Walt Mossberg is retiring in June|date=April 7, 2017|publisher=The Verge|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/7/15217980/walt-mossberg-retiring-in-june |accessdate=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="recode-mossberg-retiring"/&gt; He serves on the board of [[The News Literacy Project]] and is writing a book for St. Martin’s Press.

== Early life and education ==
{{blp unsourced section|date=April 2018}}
Mossberg, a native of [[Warwick, Rhode Island]], is a graduate of [[Pilgrim High School]], [[Brandeis University]] and the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]].

==Career==
Mossberg was a reporter and editor at ''The Wall Street Journal'' from 1970 until the end of 2013. He was based in the ''Journal's'' Washington, D.C., office, where he spent 18 years covering national and international affairs before turning his attention to technology. Mossberg's ''Personal Technology'' column appeared every Thursday from 1991 through 2013. He also edited the ''Digital Solution'' column each Wednesday (authored by his colleague, [[Katherine Boehret]]), and wrote the ''Mossberg's Mailbox'' column on Thursdays. He appeared weekly on [[CNBC]], and in web videos, and was on numerous times a guest on the [[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose Show]],&lt;ref name="charlie rose"&gt;{{cite web|title=Walter Mossberg [appearances by]|publisher=[[Charlie Rose (TV series)]]|website=charlierose.com|url=https://charlierose.com/videos/30693|accessdate=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; airing on PBS stations.

In 1999, Mossberg became the first technology writer to receive the [[Gerald Loeb Award#The Award|Loeb award for Commentary]].  In 2001, he won the World Technology Award for Media and Journalism and received an honorary Doctorate of Law from the University of Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/about/walt-mossberg/|title=About Us staff profile entry for Walt Mossberg|publisher=allthingsd.com|accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mossberg is widely regarded as one of the most influential writers on information technology. In 2004, in a lengthy profile, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' called him "The Kingmaker", saying "few reviewers have held so much power to shape an industry's successes and failures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.05/mossberg.html?pg=1 |last=Deutschman |first=Alan |title=The Kingmaker: Walt Mossberg makes or breaks products from his pundit perch at a little rag called The Wall Street Journal|date=May 2004|accessdate=2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 profile in the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' was entitled "Everyone Listens to Walter Mossberg" and declared him "someone whose judgment can ratify years of effort or sink the show."&lt;ref name="New Yorker 2007"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New Yorker]]|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/05/14/critical-mass|last=Auletta|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Auletta|title=Critical Mass: Everyone listens to Walter Mossberg|date=May 14, 2007|accessdate=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, he received the Loeb Award's Lifetime Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Gerald Loeb Award Finalists, Career Achievement Honorees and Date of Awards Banquet in New York City Announced by UCLA Anderson|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2017-gerald-loeb-award-finalists-career-achievement-honorees-and-date-of-awards-banquet-in-new-york-city-announced-by-ucla-anderson-300460104.html|website=PR Newswire|publisher=UCLA Anderson School of Management|accessdate=2018-04-21|date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In partnership with his fellow ''Journal'' columnist [[Kara Swisher]], Mossberg created, produced and hosted the ''Journal's'' annual ''All Things Digital'' conference in [[Carlsbad, California]], in which top technology leaders, such as [[Bill Gates]], [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Elon Musk]],&lt;ref name=atd20130530&gt;{{cite AV media |last=Gannes|first=Liz |title=Tesla CEO and SpaceX Founder Elon Musk: The Full D11 Interview (Video) |medium=Video interview |url=http://allthingsd.com/20130530/tesla-ceo-and-spacex-founder-elon-musk-the-full-d11-interview-video/ |accessdate=2013-05-31 |newspaper=All Things D |date=2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared on stage without prepared remarks, or slides, and were interviewed by the two columnists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|title=D: All Things Digital The Wall Street Journal Executive Conference|accessdate=2007-05-08|url=http://d.wsj.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429142557/http://d.wsj.com/index.html|archivedate = 2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That conference concept continues today in the form of their Code Conference. Mossberg and Swisher also co-edited the [[All Things Digital]] web site, which included his columns, her blog and other posts.

On May 30, 2007, Mossberg and Swisher conducted a historic, unrehearsed, joint onstage interview with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Gates and Steve Jobs at D5 (Full Session)|url=http://on.wsj.com/1BvUcQu|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 8, 2007|accessdate=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, Mossberg was one of only four journalists provided with advance access to the first iPhone in order to review it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pogue|first=David|authorlink=David Pogue|title=The 4 people Steve Jobs handpicked to review the iPhone reflect 10 years later|publisher=Yahoo Finance|date=June 25, 2017|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pogue-levy-baig-mossberg-like-review-first-iphone-10-years-ago-132309031.html|accessdate=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, 2013, by mutual agreement, [[Dow Jones &amp; Co.]] and Mossberg and Swisher announced they would not renew the contract with ''AllThingsD'', and that Mossberg would be leaving ''The Wall Street Journal'' by the end of the year.

On January 2, 2014, Mossberg and Swisher launched ''[[Re/code|Recode]]'', a tech website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Next Web|publisher=Kaylene Hong|title=Re/code, a new tech website launched by Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg, is now live|accessdate=2014-01-02|url=https://thenextweb.com/media/2014/01/02/recode-a-new-tech-website-launched-by-kara-swisher-and-walt-mossberg-is-now-live/#!rjKXS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was acquired by [[Vox Media]] in May 2015 in an all-stock deal.&lt;ref name="recode"&gt;{{cite news |title = Vox Media Adds ReCode to Its Stable of Websites |first = Sydney |last = Ember |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/business/media/vox-media-acquiring-recode.html?_r=0 |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = May 26, 2015 |accessdate = May 27, 2015 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6YpNXfmQl?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/business/media/vox-media-acquiring-recode.html?_r=1 |archivedate = May 27, 2015 |deadurl = no |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2017, Mossberg announced his planned retirement, which occurred on July 3 of that year.  "It just seems like the right time to step away," Mossberg wrote in ''Recode''. "I’m ready for something new."&lt;ref name="recode-mossberg-retiring"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mossberg|first1=Walt|title=Walt Mossberg Is Retiring in June|date=April 7, 2017|publisher=Recode|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/4/7/15211374/walt-mossberg-the-only-kingmaker-is-retiring}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final column was published on May 25, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.recode.net/2017/5/25/15689094/mossberg-final-column | title=Mossberg: The Disappearing Computer | first=Walt | last=Mossberg | date=May 25, 2017 | publisher=recode.net | accessdate=May 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final Code Conference was May 30–June 1, and his retirement podcast, performed live in New York, was on June 9.
