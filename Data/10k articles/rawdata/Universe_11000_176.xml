The '''2006 Auckland Blackout''' refers to the massive electrical [[Power blackout|blackout]] in [[Auckland]], the largest city in New Zealand, on 12 June 2006. It started at 8:30 am local time, with most areas of Auckland regaining power by 2:45 pm local time.  It affected some 230,000 customers and at least 700,000 people in and around the city.

==Immediate effect==
Power went off at around 08:30 am local time on 12 June 2006 over half of Auckland in New Zealand. Most of southern and central Auckland, including the central business district, were without power.

== Cause ==
The cause of the blackout was traced back to the Otahuhu [[Electrical substation|sub-station]], the city's main transmission switching station. A corroded [[shackle]] connecting the Otahuhu to Penrose 220&amp;nbsp;kV line's earth wire had dislodged in {{convert|90|km/h|abbr=on}} winds, letting the earth wire fall across the 220&amp;nbsp;kV line and the 110&amp;nbsp;kV busbar below it, tripping both the line and three sections of the busbar, disconnecting lines to Mount Roskill, Penrose and Pakuranga. The trip also disconnected [[Otahuhu Power Station|Otahuhu B]] and [[Southdown Power Station|Southdown]] power stations from the national grid. The trip left only one line, the now-dismantled Arapuni to Pakuranga 110&amp;nbsp;kV line, supplying Pakuranga, Penrose, and the central city. Eight seconds after the failure, this line tripped from overloading, leaving Penrose, Pakuranga, and central city substations without power, as well as parts of Otahuhu and Mount Roskill substations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Transpower Announces Reports on Auckland Power Outage in June|url=http://tdworld.com/news/Auckland-power-outage/|publisher = Transmission &amp; Distribution World|date = 11 July 2006|accessdate = 5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/0606/skmreport.pdf |title= INCIDENT REVIEW – OTAHUHU SUBSTATION LOSS OF SUPPLY 12TH JUNE 2006 |publisher= Sinclair Knight Merz |date= 23 June 2006 |accessdate= 26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation of this incident found that maintenance of the electricity transmission system was not adequate and that this substation had major and minor design deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC____20815.aspx|title=Review of Report on Auckland Transmission Outage of 12 June 2006|date=5 July 2006|author=Connell Wagner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Due to the power outage, many public services and business operations were disrupted:
* suburban commuter railway services were suspended
* over 300 groups of traffic lights were off
* some hospitals were closed and left only emergency services in operations
* radio station transmitters located in the [[Sky_Tower_(Auckland)|Sky Tower]] were also taken offline for a period of time
* mobile phone and telephone service failures
* people stuck in lifts in office buildings
* end of semester exams due to be held that day at local universities were postponed.

Since the central business district was without power from the morning rush hours, business operations and traffic were disrupted severely. Many businesses sent their staff home.

==Restoration of service==
Power was restored to the central business district of [[Auckland]] at 12:40 local time, 12 June 2006. It was estimated that all affected areas would have their power restored by 16:30 local time. At approximately 14:45, power was restored to most of Auckland, except [[Penrose, New Zealand|Penrose]], [[Glen Innes, New Zealand|Glen Innes]], [[East Tamaki]], and [[Otahuhu]].

==Improving security of supply==
The incident at Otahuhu in June 2006 had a major influence on subsequent decisions about the development of the grid. 

On 11 December 2006, the [[Electricity Commission (NZ)]] received an application from Transpower for the establishment of a new 220&amp;nbsp;kV gas insulated switchgear (GIS) facility at Otahuhu, adjacent to but geographically separate from the existing outdoor 220&amp;nbsp;kV switchyard.  This project was described as the Otahuhu substation diversity project, and included transferring approximately half of the circuits from the existing switchyard to the new GIS switchyard, to improve network resilience.  The project was approved in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.govt.nz/industry/ec-archive/grid-investment-archive/gup/2005-gup/otahuhu-substation-diversity-proposal-history/#finaldecision |title=Otahuhu substation diversity proposal – Final decision, Electricity Commission |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401020558/http://www.ea.govt.nz/industry/ec-archive/grid-investment-archive/gup/2005-gup/otahuhu-substation-diversity-proposal-history/ |archivedate=1 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further steps have been taken to increase security of supply to Auckland, by reducing the dependence on Otahuhu.  These include the diversity provided as part of the North Island Grid Upgrade Project by connecting the new [[Whakamaru to Brownhill Road transmission line]] to [[Pakuranga]] substation, rather than directly to Otahuhu.  A second major project, the [[North Auckland and Northland grid upgrade project]] provides underground 220&amp;nbsp;kV cables from Pakuranga to Penrose, and from Penrose to Albany on the North Shore, via Hobson Street in the Auckland CBD.  A 220&amp;nbsp;kV- capable overhead transmission line between Pakuranga and Otahuhu has also been upgraded from 110&amp;nbsp;kV to 220&amp;nbsp;kV.

The '''American Standard Safety System''', or ASSS, is a connection system for [[gas cylinder]]s with a volume exceeding 25 cubic feet. The connections differ in thread type and size, right and left handed threading, internal and external threading, and nipple-seat design. This variability reduces the risk of errors such as administering the wrong gas to a patient, or utilizing equipment calibrated for one gas with another. However, as there are only 26 connections for the 62 gases and mixtures recognized by the [[Compressed Gas Association|CGA]], connections are not unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Wilkins | first1 = Robert L. | last2 = Stoller | first2 = James K. | last3 = Kacmarek | first3 = Robert M. | title = Egan's Fundamentals of Respiratory Care | edition = 9, illustrated | publisher = Mosby/Elsevier | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-323-03657-3}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-11-04 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Connection specifications will be listed in cylinder catalogs as a list of abbreviations and numbers, such as that for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CGA-540 0.903-14NGO-RH-Ext. This means that the [[Compressed Gas Association]] has classified this connection as number 540, the thread bore is 0.903&amp;nbsp;inches, with 14 threads per inch. The connection is right-handed (RH) and must be turned clock-wise to tighten. The threading is external, so the connections of the cylinder and the attached equipment must be fixed together using a nipple, which is signified by NGO. A nipple is a bolt which fits together two male connections. Internal (Int) threading allows for equipment to be screwed directly onto the cylinder outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cairo | first1 = Jimmy M. | last2 = Pilbeam | first2 = Susan P. | title = Mosby's Respiratory Care Equipment | edition = 8, illustrated | publisher = Mosby/Elsevier | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-323-05176-7}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-11-04 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barakah nuclear power plant''' is the [[United Arab Emirates]]'s first nuclear power station.  It is still under construction, and four [[APR-1400]] nuclear reactors are planned to start operation successively between 2018 and 2020. The site is on UAE's [[Persian Gulf]] coastline between the sea and the [[E 11 road (United Arab Emirates)| E11 highway]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Ruwais]].

==History==
In December 2009, [[Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation]] (ENEC) awarded a coalition led by [[Korea Electric Power Corporation]] (KEPCO) a $20&amp;nbsp;billion bid to build the first nuclear power plant in the UAE. [[Barakah (Abu Dhabi)|Barakah]] was chosen as the site to build four [[APR-1400]] nuclear reactors successively, with the first scheduled to start supplying electricity in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8431904.stm |title=UAE Nuclear Power Plants |accessdate=5 May 2010 | work=BBC News | date=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In 2011 [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] reported that following detailed finance agreements, the build cost was put at $30 billion: $10 billion equity, $10 billion export-credit agency debt, and $10 billion from bank and sovereign debt. South Korea may earn a further $20 billion from operation, maintenance and fuel supply contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-11-24/u-a-e-s-plan-to-develop-nuclear-power-facilities-said-to-cost-30-billion |title=U.A.E.’s Nuclear Power Program Said to Cost $30 Billion |author=Ayesha Daya and Stefania Bianchi |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=24 November 2011 |accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A later Bloomberg report indicates the price as $25 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Abu Dhabi Said to Revive Debt Plan for First Nuclear Plant|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-03/abu-dhabi-said-to-revive-debt-plan-for-first-nuclear-power-plant-ie3wyuib|website = Bloomberg.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28|first = Matthew Martin Arif|last = Sharif}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014 the Barakah 1 reactor vessel was delivered onsite and site preparation works for Barakah 3 and 4 started.&lt;ref name=wnn-20140530&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/nn-barakah-1-reactor-vessel-delivered-3005144.html |title=Barakah 1 reactor vessel delivered |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=30 May 2014 |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wnn-20140212&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Work-to-start-on-Barakah-3-and-4-1202141.html |title=Work to start on third and fourth Barakah units |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=12 February 2014 |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the concrete-and-steel reactor containment building for Barakah 1 was completed in January 2015.&lt;ref name=pt2015 /&gt;

In March 2015 ENEC applied to FANR for operating licences for Units 1 and 2. The schedule is still for operation of Unit 1 starting in 2017, with the remaining units following annually, so Unit 4 is set to reach commercial operations in 2020.&lt;ref name=arabianbusiness-20150328&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/uae-s-enec-submits-plan-run-first-two-nuclear-reactors-587003.html |title=UAE's ENEC submits plan to run first two nuclear reactors |newspaper=Arabian Business |date=28 March 2015 |accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015 first concrete was poured for Unit 4. More than 18,000 staff were then working on the construction of all 4 units.&lt;ref name=wnn-20150902&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-UAEs-fourth-power-reactor-under-construction-0209155.html |title=UAE's fourth power reactor under construction |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=2 September 2015 |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017 the rebel [[Houthis]] group claimed to have fired a cruise missile in the direction of the Barakah plant, but the [[Emiratis|Emirati]] authorities said that no missiles had actually reached the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/yemen-security-emirates/update-1-yemens-houthi-group-says-fires-missile-toward-abu-dhabi-nuclear-reactor-idUSL8N1O3065 |title=UPDATE 1-Yemen's Houthi group says fires missile toward Abu Dhabi nuclear reactor |publisher=Reuters |date=3 December 2017 |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 22nd the project's total cost was refined to $24.4 billion to complete. Startup of Unit 1 has been delayed to late 2018 to complete operator training in accordance with international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasdaq.com/article/arab-worlds-first-nuclear-reactor-delayed-again-over-training-20180322-00792|title=Arab world's first nuclear reactor delayed again over training|last=|first=|date=March 22, 2018|website=nasdaq|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blown oil''' is a [[drying oil]] which has been modified through an oxidative process.

==Description==
[[Oil]]s are "blown" through partial [[oxidation]] of the oil at elevated temperatures. A typical blowing process involves heating the oil to {{convert|70|to|120|C}} and passing air through the liquid.&lt;ref name="doi1"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1108/eb042356| title = Blown (air oxidised) vegetable &amp; marine oils &amp; paint manufacture| journal = Pigment &amp; Resin Technology| volume = 16| issue = 5| pages = 7| year = 1987| last1 = Lower | first1 = E. S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modification causes the formation of C-O-C and C-C cross links, and [[hydroxyl]] and [[carboxyl]] functional groups.&lt;ref name="doi1"/&gt;

Blown oils are chemically different from oils modified only by heating,&lt;ref name="doi1"/&gt; which are known as [[stand oil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.seatons-uk.co.uk/home.aspx?s=62&amp;r=109&amp;p=453| title = The differences between stand oils and blown oils| work = www.seatons-uk.co.uk| accessdate = 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common types of oils that can be blown include [[linseed oil]], [[rapeseed oil]], [[castor oil]] and [[soybean oil]].

==Chemistry==
Butyric acid is a [[fatty acid]] occurring in the form of [[esters]] in animal fats.&lt;ref name=pubchem /&gt; The [[glyceride|triglyceride]] of butyric acid makes up 3–4% of butter. When butter goes rancid, butyric acid is liberated from the glyceride by [[hydrolysis]], leading to the [[unpleasant odor]].&lt;ref name=pubchem /&gt; It is one of the fatty acid subgroup called [[short-chain fatty acid]]s. Butyric acid is a medium-strong acid that reacts with bases and affects many metals.&lt;ref name="inchem1"&gt;[http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics1334.htm ICSC 1334 – BUTYRIC ACID]. Inchem.org (23 November 1998). Retrieved on 2014-03-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The acid is an oily, colorless liquid that is easily soluble in [[water]], [[ethanol]], and [[ether]], and can be separated from an aqueous phase by saturation with salts such as [[calcium chloride]]. It is oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[acetic acid]] using [[potassium dichromate]] and [[sulfuric acid]], while alkaline [[potassium permanganate]] oxidizes it to carbon dioxide. The calcium salt, Ca(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is less soluble in hot water than in cold. Butyric acid has a [[structural isomer]] called [[isobutyric acid]] (2-methylpropanoic acid).

===Safety===

Personal protective equipment such as rubber or PVC gloves, protective eye goggles, and chemical-resistant clothing and shoes are used to minimize risks when handling butyric acid.

Inhalation of butyric acid may result in soreness of throat, coughing, a burning sensation, and laboured breathing. Ingestion of the acid may result in abdominal pain, shock, and collapse. Physical exposure to the acid may result in pain, blistering and skin burns, while exposure to the eyes may result in pain, severe deep burns and loss of vision.&lt;ref name="inchem1"/&gt;

==History==
Butyric acid was first observed in impure form in 1814 by the French chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]]. By 1818, he had purified it sufficiently to characterize it. However, Chevreul did not publish his early research on butyric acid; instead, he deposited his findings in manuscript form with the secretary of the [[Academy of Science of France|Academy of Sciences]] in Paris, France. [[Henri Braconnot]], a French chemist, was also researching the composition of butter and was publishing his findings, and this led to disputes about priority. As early as 1815, Chevreul claimed that he had found the substance responsible for the smell of butter.&lt;ref&gt;Chevreul (1815) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tZU5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Lettre de M. Chevreul à MM. les rédacteurs des Annales de chimie"] (Letter from Mr. Chevreul to the editors of the Annals of Chemistry), ''Annales de chimie'', '''94''' : 73–79; in a footnote spanning pages 75–76, he mentions that he had found a substance that is responsible for the smell of butter.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1817, he published some of his findings regarding the properties of butyric acid and named it.&lt;ref&gt;Chevreul (1817) [https://books.google.com/books?id=y1E3AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Extrait d'une lettre de M. Chevreul à MM. les Rédacteurs du Journal de Pharmacie"] (Extract of a letter from Mr. Chevreul to the editors of the Journal of Pharmacy), ''Journal de Pharmacie et des sciences accessoires'', '''3''' : 79–81.  On p. 81, he named butyric acid:  ''"Ce principe, que j'ai appelé depuis acid butérique, … "''  (This principle [i.e., constituent], which I have since named "butyric acid", … )&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1823 that he presented the properties of butyric acid in detail.&lt;ref&gt;E. Chevreul, ''Recherches chimiques sur les corps gras d'origine animale'' [Chemical researches on fatty substances of animal origin] (Paris, France: F.G. Levrault, 1823),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=r46rnl27h70C&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 115–133].&lt;/ref&gt; The name of butyric acid comes from the Latin word for butter, ''butyrum'' (or ''buturum''), the substance in which butyric acid was first found.&lt;ref name=pubchem /&gt;

==Uses==
Butyric acid is used in the preparation of various butyrate esters. Low-molecular-weight esters of butyric acid, such as [[methyl butyrate]], have mostly pleasant aromas or tastes.&lt;ref name=pubchem /&gt; As a consequence, they are used as food and perfume additives. It is an approved food flavoring in the EU FLAVIS database (number 08.005).

Due to its powerful odor, it has also been used as a fishing bait additive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nutrabaits.net/freezer.html Freezer Baits] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125054429/http://www.nutrabaits.net/freezer.html |date=25 January 2010 }}, nutrabaits.net&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the commercially available flavors used in [[Common carp|carp]] (''Cyprinus carpio'') baits use butyric acid as their ester base; however, it is not clear whether fish are attracted by the butyric acid itself or the substances added to it. Butyric acid was, however, one of the few organic acids shown to be palatable for both [[tench]] and [[bitterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-2979.2003.00121.x | last1 = Kasumyan | first1 = A.O. | last2 = Døving | first2 = K.B. | year = 2003 | title = Taste preferences in fishes | url = | journal = Fish and Fisheries | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 289–347 | name-list-format = vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substance has also been used as a [[stink bomb]] by [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] to disrupt Japanese [[whaling]] crews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newser.com/story/80755/japanese-whalers-injured-by-acid-firing-activists.html Japanese Whalers Injured by Acid-Firing Activists], newser.com, 10 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Butyric acid, along with acetic acid, can be reacted with [[cellulose]] to produce the organic ester [[Cellulose#Derivatives|cellulose acetate butyrate]] (CAB), which is used in a wide variety of tools, parts, and coatings, and is more resistant to degradation than [[cellulose acetate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lokensgard|first1=Erik|title=Industrial Plastics: Theory and Applications|date=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, CAB can degrade with exposure to heat and moisture, releasing butyric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=R.

== Biochemistry ==

=== Microbial biosynthesis ===
{{missing information|section|date=May 2015|2 additional metabolic pathways: [http://mbio.asm.org/content/5/2/e00889-14/F1.expansion.html]}}
Butyrate is produced as end-product of a fermentation process solely performed by [[Obligate anaerobe|obligate]] [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[bacteria]]. Fermented [[Kombucha]] "tea" includes butyric acid as a result of the fermentation. This fermentation pathway was discovered by [[Louis Pasteur]] in 1861. Examples of butyrate-producing [[species]] of bacteria:

*''[[Clostridium butyricum]]''
*''[[Clostridium kluyveri]]''
*''Clostridium pasteurianum''
*''[[Faecalibacterium prausnitzii]]''
*''[[Fusobacterium nucleatum]]''
*''Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens''
*''Eubacterium limosum''

The pathway starts with the [[glycolysis|glycolytic]] cleavage of [[glucose]] to two [[molecule]]s of [[pyruvate]], as happens in most organisms. Pyruvate is then [[oxidation|oxidized]] into [[acetyl coenzyme A]] using a unique mechanism that involves an [[enzyme]] system called [[pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase]]. Two molecules of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and two molecules of elemental [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are formed as waste products from the cell. Then,

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| β-hydroxybutyryl CoA converts into [[crotonyl CoA]] || [[crotonase]]

|-
| A [[phosphate]] group replaces CoA to form [[butyryl phosphate]] || [[phosphobutyrylase]]
|-
| The phosphate group joins [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] to form [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[butyrate]] || [[butyrate kinase]]
|}

ATP is produced, as can be seen, in the last step of the fermentation. Three molecules of ATP are produced for each glucose molecule, a relatively high yield. The balanced equation for this fermentation is
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Several species form [[acetone]] and [[n-Butanol|''n''-butanol]] in an alternative pathway, which starts as butyrate fermentation. Some of these species are:
*''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]]'', the most prominent acetone and propianol producer, used also in industry
*''[[Clostridium beijerinckii]]''
*''[[Clostridium tetanomorphum]]''
*''[[Clostridium aurantibutyricum]]''

These bacteria begin with butyrate fermentation, as described above, but, when the [[pH]] drops below 5, they switch into butanol and acetone production to prevent further lowering of the pH. Two molecules of butanol are formed for each molecule of acetone.

The change in the pathway occurs after acetoacetyl CoA formation. This intermediate then takes two possible pathways:
*acetoacetyl CoA → acetoacetate → acetone
*acetoacetyl CoA → butyryl CoA → [[butyraldehyde]] → butanol

===Fermentable fiber sources===
Highly-fermentable fiber residues, such as those from [[resistant starch]], [[oat bran]], [[pectin]], and [[guar]] are transformed by [[gut flora|colonic bacteria]] into [[short-chain fatty acid]]s (SCFA) including butyrate, producing more SCFA than less fermentable fibers such as [[cellulose]]s.&lt;ref name=morrison/&gt;&lt;ref name="lupton"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lupton JR | title = Microbial degradation products influence colon cancer risk: the butyrate controversy | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 2 | pages = 479–82 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14747692 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/134/2/479 | doi=10.1093/jn/134.2.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study found that resistant starch consistently produces more butyrate than other types of [[dietary fiber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cummings JH, Macfarlane GT, Englyst HN | title = Prebiotic digestion and fermentation | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 73 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 415S–420S | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11157351 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/73.2.415s }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production of SCFA from fibers in [[ruminant]] animals such as cattle is responsible for the butyrate content of milk and butter.&lt;ref name=mcnabney/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grummer RR | title = Effect of feed on the composition of milk fat | journal = Journal of Dairy Science | volume = 74 | issue = 9 | pages = 3244–57 | date = September 1991 | pmid = 1779073 | doi = 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(91)78510-X | url = http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0022-0302/PIIS002203029178510X.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fructans are another source of prebiotic soluble dietary fibers which can be digested to produce butyrate.

=== Pharmacodynamics ===

Butyric acid is one of two primary [[endogenous agonist]]s of human [[hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor&amp;nbsp;2]] (HCA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, aka GPR109A), a {{nowrap|[[Gi alpha subunit|G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled]]}} [[G protein-coupled receptor]] (GPCR),&lt;ref name="IUPHAR's comprehensive 2011 review on HCARs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IUPHAR-DB HCAR family page" /&gt;

Like other [[short-chain fatty acid]]s (SCFAs), butyrate is an agonist at the [[free fatty acid receptor]]s [[FFAR2]] and [[FFAR3]], which function as nutrient sensors that facilitate the [[homeostatic control of energy balance]];&lt;ref name="Butyrate pharmacodynamics and neuroepigenetic effects 2016 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bourassa MW, Alim I, Bultman SJ, Ratan RR | title = Butyrate, neuroepigenetics and the gut microbiome: Can a high fiber diet improve brain health? | journal = Neurosci.

While transient IFN-γ signaling is generally associated with normal host [[immune response]], chronic IFN-γ signaling is often associated with chronic inflammation. It has been shown that butyrate inhibits activity of HDAC1 that is bound to the Fas gene promoter in T cells, resulting in hyperacetylation of the Fas promoter and up-regulation of [[Fas receptor]] on the T-cell surface.&lt;ref name="pmid22517765"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimmerman MA, Singh N, Martin PM, Thangaraju M, Ganapathy V, Waller JL, Shi H, Robertson KD, Munn DH, Liu K | title = Butyrate suppresses colonic inflammation through HDAC1-dependent Fas upregulation and Fas-mediated apoptosis of T cells | journal = Am.

Similar to other HCA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; agonists studied, butyrate also produces marked anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of tissues, including the brain, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and [[Inflammation#Vascular component|vascular tissue]].&lt;ref name="Niacin neuroinflammation"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Offermanns S, Schwaninger M | title = Nutritional or pharmacological activation of HCA(2) ameliorates neuroinflammation | journal = Trends Mol Med | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 245–255 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25766751 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2015.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Niacin vascular inflammation"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chai JT, Digby JE, Choudhury RP | title = GPR109A and vascular inflammation | journal = Curr Atheroscler Rep | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | page = 325 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23526298 | pmc = 3631117 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-013-0325-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HCA2 anti-inflammatory effects"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graff EC, Fang H, Wanders D, Judd RL | title = Anti-inflammatory effects of the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 | journal = Metab.

Butyric acid is an important energy ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]) source for cells lining the mammalian [[Large intestine|colon]] (colonocytes). Without butyric acid for energy, colon cells undergo upregulated autophagy (i.e., self-digestion).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donohoe|first=Dallas R.|last2=Garge|first2=Nikhil|last3=Zhang|first3=Xinxin|last4=Sun|first4=Wei|last5=O’Connell|first5=Thomas M.|last6=Bunger|first6=Maureen K.|last7=Bultman|first7=Scott J.|date=4 May 2011|title=The Microbiome and Butyrate Regulate Energy Metabolism and Autophagy in the Mammalian Colon|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=13|issue=5|pages=517–526|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2011.02.018|issn=1550-4131|pmc=3099420|pmid=21531334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cancer====
Butyrate produces different effects in healthy and cancerous cells; this is known as the "butyrate paradox". In particular, butyrate inhibits colonic tumor cells and promotes healthy colonic epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Vanhoutvin SA, Troost FJ, Hamer HM, Lindsey PJ, Koek GH, Jonkers DM, Kodde A, Venema K, Brummer RJ |title=Butyrate-induced transcriptional changes in human colonic mucosa |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=e6759 |year=2009 |pmid=19707587 |pmc=2727000 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0006759 |editor1-last=Bereswill |editor1-first=Stefan }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The signaling mechanism is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klampfer L, Huang J, Sasazuki T, Shirasawa S, Augenlicht L | title = Oncogenic Ras promotes butyrate-induced apoptosis through inhibition of gelsolin expression | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 35 | pages = 36680–8 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15213223 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M405197200 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/279/35/36680.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of [[volatile fatty acids]] such as butyrate from fermentable fibers may contribute to the role of dietary fiber in colon cancer.&lt;ref name="lupton"/&gt; [[Short-chain fatty acid]]s, which include butyric acid, are produced by beneficial [[Gut flora|colonic bacteria]] ([[probiotics]]) that feed on, or ferment prebiotics, which are plant products that contain dietary fiber.

Nutr.|year=2004|isbn=|location=vol. 134 no. 2|pages=479–482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, some researchers have sought to eliminate butyrate and consider it a potential cancer driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.utoronto.ca/media-releases/low-carb-diet-cuts-risk-of-colon-cancer-study-finds/|title=Low-carb diet cuts risk of colon cancer, study finds {{!}} University of Toronto Media Room|website=media.utoronto.ca|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in mice indicate it drives transformation of [[MSH2|MSH2-deficient]] colon epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belcheva|first=Antoaneta|last2=Irrazabal|first2=Thergiory|last3=Robertson|first3=Susan J.|last4=Streutker|first4=Catherine|last5=Maughan|first5=Heather|last6=Rubino|first6=Stephen|last7=Moriyama|first7=Eduardo H.|last8=Copeland|first8=Julia K.|last9=Kumar|first9=Sachin|date=2014-07-17|title=Gut microbial metabolism drives transformation of MSH2-deficient colon epithelial cells|journal=Cell|volume=158|issue=2|pages=288–299|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.04.051|issn=1097-4172|pmid=25036629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diabetes====
A review on the relationship between the [[microbiome]] and diabetes asserted that butyrate can induce "profound immunometabolic effects" in animal models and humans with [[type 2 diabetes]],&lt;ref name="Review for diabetes"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tilg H, Moschen AR | title = Microbiota and diabetes: an evolving relationship | journal = Gut | volume = 63 | issue = 9 | pages = 1513–1521 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24833634 | doi = 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-306928}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is no such use in clinical practice and further research is needed.{{mcn|date=November 2018}}

===Addiction===

Butyric acid is an {{abbrlink|HDAC|histone deacetylase}} inhibitor that is selective for class I HDACs in humans.&lt;ref name="IUPHAR" /&gt; HDACs are [[histone-modifying enzyme]]s that can cause histone deacetylation and repression of gene expression. HDACs are important regulators of synaptic formation, [[synaptic plasticity]], and [[long-term memory]] formation.

'''''Chornobyl.3828''''' or '''''Chernobyl.3828''''' is a 2011 Ukrainian documentary film about the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Directed by Sergei Zabolotnyy, it is dedicated to the "liquidators" who were involved in cleaning the most dangerous areas of the plant roof, the "M" zone. The film is named for the 3,828 people who worked in this area.

==Plot==

Twenty-five years have passed since Valeriy Starodumov worked as a dosimeter scout in September 1986. Valeriy worked at the epicenter of the explosion, the reactor's operation area, which was the most radioactive part of the site. The protagonist, a direct participant in the operation, went to the roof himself and brought people there after a failed attempt to clear the area with robots. At the government level, it was decided to assign soldiers and cadets of military schools to the task of cleaning the roofs. Unique pictures of the events of 1986 are widely used in the film. ''Chernobyl.3828'' is dedicated to people who saved the world from the radioactive contamination at the cost of their health and life.

The film director Sergei Zabolotnyy commented, "We all know what happened on April 26, 1986 but we know next to nothing about the events of the summer and autumn of 1986. ''Chernobyl.3828'' is just one of many stories you need to know and remember."

==Awards==
* 2012&amp;nbsp; – at the International Film Festival of Documentary Films "Film Chronicle" (Kyiv) the film ''Chernobyl 3828'' won the Grand Prix.

The '''Church Rock uranium mill spill''' occurred in the US state of [[New Mexico]] on July 16, 1979, when United Nuclear Corporation's [[Church Rock, New Mexico|Church Rock]] [[Uranium mining#Heap leaching|uranium mill]] [[tailings]] disposal pond breached its dam.&lt;ref name=courier&gt;{{citation|title=Navajos mark 20th anniversary of Church Rock spill|newspaper=The Daily Courier|date=July 18, 1999|location=[[Prescott, Arizona]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pasternak&gt;{{cite book|last=Pasternak |first=Judy |year=2010 |title=Yellow Dirt: A Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed|publisher=Free Press |isbn= 1416594825 |ref=pasternak|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1,000 tons of solid [[radioactive waste|radioactive mill waste]] and 93 million gallons of acidic, radioactive tailings solution flowed into the [[Puerco River]], and contaminants traveled {{convert|80|mi|km}} downstream to [[Navajo County, Arizona]] and onto the [[Navajo Nation]].&lt;ref name=Pasternak /&gt; The mill was located on privately owned land approximately 17 miles north of [[Gallup, New Mexico]], and bordered to the north and southwest by Navajo Nation Tribal Trust lands.&lt;ref name=EPANovember /&gt; Local residents, who were mostly Navajos, used the Puerco River for irrigation and livestock and were not immediately aware of the toxic danger.&lt;ref name=Pasternak/&gt;

==Dam failure==
At around 5:30 am on July 16, 1979, a 20-foot breach formed in the south cell of United Nuclear Corporation's [[Church Rock, New Mexico|Church Rock]] uranium mill tailings disposal pond, and 1,100 tons of solid radioactive mill waste and approximately {{convert|93|e6USgal|m3}} of acidic, radioactive tailings solution flowed into Pipeline Arroyo, a tributary of the Puerco River.&lt;ref name=Pasternak/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruggeetal/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA2003&gt;{{Citation|title=Second Five-Year Review Report for the United Nuclear Corporation.

===Response===
At 6:00 am, a United Nuclear Corporation employee noticed the breach and suspended further discharge of tailings solution to the holding pond.&lt;ref name=Bruggeetal/&gt; By 8:00, a temporary dike had stopped the flow of residual tailings solution.&lt;ref name=Bruggeetal/&gt;

The [[Indian Health Service]] and the Environmental Improvement Division of New Mexico warned local residents over the radio and with signs not to drink from, water livestock at, or enter the Puerco River, but many Navajos in the area didn't speak English or couldn't read and were unaware of the dangers of radiation.&lt;ref name=young/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brugge2&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Brugge|editor1-first=Doug|editor2-last=Benally|editor2-first=Timothy|editor3-last=Yazzie-Lewis|editor3-first=Esther|year=2006|title=[[The Navajo People and Uranium Mining]]|publisher=University of New Mexico|isbn=978-0826337795|ref=brugge, benally, and yazzie-lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Nuclear Corporation employees were dispatched to warn [[Navajo language|Navajo-speaking]] residents downstream in accordance with a state contingency plan, but not until a few days after the spill.&lt;ref name=congress&gt;US Congress, House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment.

The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Division said the spill's "short-term and long-term impacts on people and the environment were quite limited."&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;{{Citation| title = Uranium Spill Still Worries Navajos| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| date = July 21, 1983| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/21/us/uranium-spill-still-worries-navajos.html| accessdate = December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Nuclear denied claims that the spill caused livestock deaths. The company said in a statement issued by an attorney, "We just don't know of any substance to those claims. Some people aren't going to be satisfied no matter how thoroughly you show it."&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;

Under the "agreement state" legislative framework of the [[Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act]], the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] left New Mexico to handle the dam failure until October 12, 1979, when it was notified that the state would permit the uranium mill to resume operation that week. The NRC then suspended United Nuclear's operating license until it could be determined that the embankment was stable.&lt;ref name=Grammer/&gt; After fewer than four months of downtime following the dam failure, the mill resumed operations on {{date|November 2, 1979|mdy}}.  This further contaminated the groundwater and resulted in the mill site's placement on the EPA's [[National Priorities List]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=Bruggeetal/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA2003/&gt; United Nuclear made a $525,000 out-of-court settlement with the Navajo Nation a year after the spill.&lt;ref name=Kuletz27&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuletz|first=Valerie|title=The Tainted Desert|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=1998|page=27|ref=kuletz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the amount of radioactivity released, the accident was larger in magnitude than the [[Three Mile Island accident]] of the same year.&lt;ref name=Pasternak/&gt;&lt;ref name=congress/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruggeetal/&gt; The spill has been called "the largest [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|radioactive accident]] in U.S. history," but the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] has said that this is "an overstatement," and that "there have been a number of other events that have been more significant in terms of radiological impact. The event was more significant from an environmental perspective than from a human one."&lt;ref name=courier/&gt;

==Causes==

The dam formed the southern wall of one of the mill's three holding ponds, which were used to evaporate tailings solution until the remaining solid waste could be buried.&lt;ref name=Mantonya&gt;{{citation|last=Mantonya|first=Kurt T.|title=Contamination Nation|publisher=[[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]]|date=January 1, 1999|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&amp;context=nebanthro|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its operation from 1967 to 1982, the mill produced 3.5 million tons of tailings at the rate of 4,000 tons a day.&lt;ref name=EPANovember&gt;{{citation|title=United Nuclear Corporation (McKinley County)|publisher=EPA|date=November 21, 2012|url=http://www.epa.gov/region6/6sf/pdffiles/united-nuclear-nm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=admin/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPAEngineering&gt;{{citation|title=Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis: Northeast Church Rock (NECR) Mine Site, Gallup, New Mexico|publisher=EPA Region 9|date=May 30, 2009|location=San Francisco|pages=6|ref=EPAEngineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 35-foot-high embankment was constructed on a deposit of collapsible clayey, silty sand a hundred feet deep.&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt; United Nuclear used a new design, recommended by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that used earth rather than tailings themselves as building material.&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{Citation|last1 =Young|first1=Lise|title = What Price Progress?

Horizontal and vertical cracks formed along the southern part of the embankment, allowing the acidic tailings solution to penetrate and [[Dispersion (geology)|weaken]] the embankment.&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt; A sand beach was constructed to protect the face of the embankment from the tailings solution, but it was not properly maintained. Prior to the collapse, the level of the tailings solution in the holding pond had risen two feet higher than the dam's designed limit, and the sand beach no longer provided the dam protection.&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wasserman&gt;Wasserman, Harry and Norman Solomon, ''[http://www.ratical.com/radiation/KillingOurOwn/index.html Killing Our Own: The Disaster of America's Experience with Atomic Radiation],'' New York: Dell Publishing Co, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] concluded in its report to Governor [[Bruce King]] of New Mexico that the principal cause of failure was differential [[Settlement (structural)|settlement]] of the foundation beneath the dam wall,&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt; and the report commissioned by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission corroborated this conclusion.&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt; Critical variations in tailings pond operation practice from approved procedures contributed further to the dam failure.&lt;ref name=young/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Roth | first1 = Colonel Bernard J| title = Review Comments and Recommendations to Geotechnical Investigational Reports - Church Rock Tailings Dam | publisher = Army Corps of Engineers | date = 9 October 1979 | location = Albuquerque, New Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Nuclear's Chief Operating Officer, J. David Hann, blamed the failure of dam on the pointed shape of the [[bedrock]] beneath the embankment, which he said acted as a fulcrum and weakened the dam.&lt;ref name=congress/&gt;

Cracks were first noted in the dam wall by independent consultants in December 1977 and were sealed with [[bentonite]] and [[kerosene]] slurry in February 1978.&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt; United Nuclear was notified of the cracking, but, aside from the initial seal, took little or no preventative action.&lt;ref name=young/&gt; United Nuclear did not make regular inspections of the dam despite strong recommendations by independent consultants that it do so.&lt;ref name=young/&gt; Further cracking was noted in October 1978. Neither the facility owner nor the State Engineer were formally notified of the episodes of cracking prior to the dam breach, though Arizona representative [[Mo Udall|Morris K. Udall]] testified before Congress that at least three federal and state agencies had "ample opportunity" to predict that the dam's failure was likely.&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt;&lt;ref name=preventable&gt;{{Citation|last=Ward|first=Sinclair|title=Uranium Spill Described as Preventable|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|page=A5|date=October 23, 1979|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=3S8G-DRJ0-0009-N3B0&amp;csi=8075&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true|accessdate=December 9, 2012|ref=ward}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same Congressional hearing, the United States Army Corps of Engineers testified that United Nuclear ignored warnings from the Corps that the dam was structurally unsound.&lt;ref name=Mantonya/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9625">[[File:Cumulus20 - NOAA.jpg|thumb|Towering cumulus clouds are often associated with cloud suck.]]
'''Cloud suck''' is a phenomenon commonly known in [[paragliding]], [[hang gliding]], and [[Glider (sailplane)|sailplane]] flying where pilots experience significant [[lift (soaring)|lift]] due to a [[thermal]] under the base of [[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]] clouds, especially [[towering cumulus]] and [[cumulonimbus]]. The vertical extent of a cumulus cloud is a good indicator of the strength of lift beneath it, and the potential for cloud suck.&lt;ref name=meier&gt;{{cite book | last = Pagen | first = Dennis | title = The Art of Paragliding | publisher = Black Mountain Books | location = City | year = 2001 | pages = 105, 108| isbn = 0-936310-14-6 |quote = Remember, the thickness of a cumulus clouds is the biggest indicator of the level of lift beneath it and the potential for cloud suck...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cloud suck most commonly occurs in [[Low pressure area|low pressure weather]] and in humid conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pagen | first = Dennis | title = Understanding the Sky | publisher = Sport Aviation Pubns | location = Spring Mills, PA | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-936310-10-3 | quote=Cloud suck seems to occur most commonly in low pressure weather and especially in humid conditions. | page= 230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloud suck is typically associated with an increase in thermal updraft velocity near [[cloud base]]. As a parcel of air lifted in a thermal rises, it also cools, and water vapour will eventually condense to form a cloud if the parcel rises above the [[lifted condensation level]]. As the water vapour condenses, it releases its [[latent heat of vaporization]], thereby increasing the buoyancy of the parcel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Macgorman | first = D. | title = The Electrical Nature of Storms | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-19-507337-1 | quote = As the water vapor condenses, it releases its latent heat of vaporization, thereby increasing the buoyancy of the parcel. | page = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The updraft is amplified by this latent heat release.&lt;ref name=meier/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fox | first = Peter | title = Geophysical and Astrophysical Convection | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | location = Washington | year = 2000 | isbn = 90-5699-258-9 | quote = The updraft is amplified by latent heat release... | page = 251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the process that causes this amplification happens above cloud base height, the effect is often noticeable as much as 300 m (1,000 feet) below cloud base. In fact, it is this effect ''below'' cloud base, not the effect ''within'' the cloud, that is generally referred to by pilots as cloud suck. The telltale signs for a pilot climbing in the thermal under a "sucking" cloud are (1) lift strengthening, (2) lift getting smoother, and (3) widening of the thermal.

Paraglider pilots have reported being unable to descend in strong cloud suck, even after bringing their canopies into deep spiral, which would normally result in a rapid vertical descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Simpson | first = Joe | title = The Beckoning Silence | publisher = Mountaineers Books | location = Seattle | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-89886-941-2 |quote = As she instigated the stall she was alarmed to realize that far from free-falling she was still slowly being pulled upwards. | page = 62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud suck is especially dangerous for paraglider pilots, whose maximum speed is less than 30 knots, because storm clouds (Cumulonimbus) can expand and develop rapidly over a large area with accompanying large areas of strong lift.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Fletcher | title = Flying the Mountains | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional  | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-07-141053-8 | quote = Paraglider pilots, whose maximum speed is less than 30 knots, have a particular phobia about flying under large cumulus clouds. | page = 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Italian paraglider Paolo Antoniazzi, 66 years old retired Army general, died after being sucked into a thunderstorm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adnkronos.com/fatti/cronaca/2014/07/13/udine-trovato-morto-parapendista-risucchiato-dal-temporale_OQ0nFLyA2rvqaNLXQRRfUN.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with hang-gliders and paragliders, [[Glider (sailplane)|sailplanes]] have much higher top speeds (often over 250&amp;nbsp;km/h), and can more easily escape powerful cumulonimbus clouds by flying away quickly or by using very effective [[Air brake (aircraft)|air brakes]]. A sailplane also has the added benefit of the pilot being able to put the sailplane into a spin to descend rapidly without over speeding. 

[[File:Shenandoah Disaster.jpg|thumb|300px|The wreck of the ''Shenandoah''.]]
Cloud suck is also a concern for powered aircraft but is usually not a lethal hazard, except in extreme weather situations.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; The [[USS Shenandoah (ZR-1)|USS ''Shenandoah'']], the first rigid [[airship]] built in the United States, and the first in the world to be inflated with [[helium]], was lost in a cloud suck accident associated with a [[squall line]]. At about 6:00 AM on 3 September 1925, near [[Ava, Ohio|Ava]] in northern [[Noble County, Ohio|Noble County]], [[Ohio]], the ''Shenandoah'' was suddenly caught in a violent updraft while at an altitude of 2,100 feet, rising at the rate of a meter per second. At about 6,200 feet the ascent was checked, but the ship began to descend. When halfway to the ground it was hit by another updraft and began to rise rapidly at an even faster rate. Ultimately the keel snapped, and the ship broke up while still more than a mile above the ground. ''Shenandoah''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s commanding officer and 13 other officers and men were killed. Twenty-nine members of the crew survived the break-up, although some received serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2915">A '''coastal warning display tower''', also known as a '''storm warning tower''', is a type of [[signal station]] in the form of [[skeletal tower|skeletal towers]] designed to provide warnings of hazardous wind conditions in coastal areas.  The towers were developed in 1898 on the orders of President [[William McKinley]]. Through a system of flags, the towers can indicate not only wind-related warnings, but also major aspects of the local daily [[weather forecast]].

[[File:Herostratus defcon maritime 4.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Warning pennant]]
[[File:Herostratus defcon maritime 2.jpg|thumb|100px|Warning flag]]
A single red [[Pennon|pennant]] was shown from the top of the tower as a [[small craft advisory]]; for a [[gale warning]], two such pennants were used.  Two square flags, red with a black square at center, indicate an approaching hurricane or winds &gt;73 MPH. One such flag warns of [[Severe weather terminology (United States)#Wind and tropical cyclones|storm-force winds]] or an approaching [[tropical storm]].

Three lights, two red and one white, carry the signal at night.  Red over white indicates a small craft advisory, white over red indicates a gale warning, red over red indicates a storm warning.  All three lights together, red-white-red, warns of a [[hurricane]] or other [[hurricane force wind warning|hurricane-force wind event]].

Other flags can be used to indicate the direction of winds during a tropical storm or storm warning, to indicate the temperature change relative to the previous day, to warn of an approaching cold front, and to show the forecast coverage of precipitation (widespread fair weather, scattered precipitation, or widespread precipitation).

The system of towers is widely considered unnecessary today due to the prevalence of [[NOAA Weather Radio|NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards]], and few original towers survive. However, the system of using flags to indicate warnings related to strong winds in coastal areas remains in use by the [[U.S. Coast Guard]], using ordinary flagpoles in lieu of the larger, more expensive, and more complex towers. At least one complete CWD tower, with all of its original equipment, remains in full operation in the city of [[Manteo, North Carolina]].

The [[Danelectro]] '''Amp-In-Case''', properly known as '''Solid-body Electric Guitar with "All-in-one" Amplifier-Case''' or '''Silvertone 1448/1449/1451/1452/1457''' is a line of guitar sets introduced from 1962 to 1968. It was sold for US $67.95 (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|68|1962|r=0}}}} in today's funds{{inflation-fn|US}}), sometimes including a 45 rpm how-to-play [[Gramophone record|record]], as part of [[Sears]] [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]]. It was later reissued in 2008 in modified form as the "Dano '63" without the amp-in-case. The Dano '63 was also available as a baritone guitar&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danguitars.com/Baritone.html Baritone]&lt;/ref&gt; and a long- and short-scale bass guitar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danguitars.com/Bass.html Bass]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amplifier==
The amplifier is built into the top-half of the hard-shell guitar case. The first one, the 1448 series, was a simple 3-watt [[guitar amplifier|amplifier]] with 2 tubes plus 1 tube rectifier, 5-inch speaker, and gain control. In 1963, the 1449 series (later renamed 1457) was released, with a 5-watt amplifier with 3 tubes (and 1 tube rectifier) amplifier, with 8-inch speakers, gain, tone, tremolo (speed and strength), 2 inputs, and one foot-switch. The front end of the case has its top half covered in cloth for the speaker. In 1966, the amp-in-case comes with both the non-tremolo version 1451 (modified from 1448) and tremolo version 1452 (modified from 1449). Electronically they are identical, but the speakers are moved to the opposite lid.

The case is approx 37x15x3 inches. When the guitar is stored inside the case, with the speaker cloth facing upward, the guitar neck would sit on the left side of the amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silvertoneworld.net/amps_60s.html Silvertone world]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guitar==
When first introduced in 1962, the 3/4-sized guitar had a double cutaway semi-hollow body in a shape similar to the well known Fender Stratocaster. The body was composed of a [[Populus|poplar]] center block and frame with Masonite top and back. It came with a single [[lipstick pickup]] at the "middle" position, controlled by a volume and tone knob. The poplar neck was fitted with a Brazilian rosewood fingerboard, and only had 18 frets. The neck connected to the body with three bolts.

By Fall of 1963, there was a two pickup model available. The new model 1449 was the same as its predecessor, but equipped with 2 lipstick pickups and a 21 fret neck. Eventually the semi-hollow guitar models were replaced with solid-body design similar to Danelectro's Dane line.

==Reissue==
The guitar, minus the amp-in-case, was reissued by Evets Corporation for 2008 as the Dano '63. It is not an exact copy, but updated with modern materials and construction methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicradar.com/gear/all/guitars/electric/6-string-solid-body/dano-63-134136/review Musicradar.com review]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dano '63 was also available as a long- and short-scale bass and a baritone guitar.

The Amp-in-case amplifier has been redesigned and reissued in an amp head form by '''Fritz Brothers Guitars''' in [[Mendocino County, California]]. This new take on the original amp does not include the speaker, but can be run into a separate speaker cabinet, or through a larger PA system instead. It is primarily marketed to fit in a typical American hardshell [[Stratocaster]] style guitar case, but it can be custom built to fit other cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fritzbrothersguitars.com/amp.htm Fritz Brothers Amp in the Case]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The Dano '63 Baritone was reviewed by several guitar magazines, and was well received. [[Guitar Player]] praised its clarity and [[timbre|tone]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/seven-baritone-electrics/mar-08/34253 Guitar Player Reviews Seven Baritone Electrics]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]] magazine awarded it as a "Guitarist Choice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danelectro.com/raves_1e.html Guitarist '63 Baritone review]&lt;/ref&gt; In the May 2008 issue of [[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]] magazine, both of the Dano '63 basses were favorably reviewed, with the long scale being chosen as a "Guitarist Choice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danelectro.com/raves_1e.html Guitarist review]&lt;/ref&gt;
A bassist and a music journalist from Poland, Adam Pawlowski, noticed that the unmodified Dano '63 Baritone equipped with Ernie Ball 2837 strings' set is nothing else than the famous Danelectro's six-string bass tuned E-E, one octave below the guitar. That's because of its 29-5/8" scale.

==Notable players==
Famous musicians such as [[Mick Jagger]] (of the [[Rolling Stones]]), [[Beck]], [[Cat Power]], [[Daniel Rossen]] of [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]], [[Jeremy Earl]] of [[Woods (band)]] and [[Dexter Romweber]] (of the [[Flat Duo Jets]]), have made use of the Amp-in-case model live on stage, and [[Dave Grohl]] and [[Sammy Hagar]] both owned one as children.&lt;ref&gt;Interview in Australian Guitar Magazine volume 62&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EnPowered''' is a Canadian [[energy management]] organization, established in 2015. The company groups together consumers and businesses to get a lower [[Group buying|group-buying]] rate for energy and control their energy usage as well as costs.

It was founded by Tomas Van Stee in 2015 in [[Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EnPowered Launches into Energy Saving - StartUp HERE Toronto|url=http://startupheretoronto.com/sectors/technology/enpowered-launches-into-energy-saving/|website=StartUp HERE Toronto|accessdate=18 July 2017|date=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to the Velocity Incubator at the [[University of Waterloo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why I made my StartUp Pledge {{!}} StartUp Pledge|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/startup-pledge/why-i-made-my-startup-pledge|website=StartUp Pledge|accessdate=18 July 2017|language=en|date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eye on electricity rates {{!}} Tomas van Stee, HBA ’13|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/news/in-the-media/2016/7/eye-on-electricity-rates-tomas-van-stee-hba-13/|website=Ivey Business School|accessdate=18 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4200">'''Formic acid fuel cells''' ('''direct formic acid fuel cells''' or '''DFAFCs''') are a subcategory of [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell]]s where the fuel, [[formic acid]], is not reformed, but fed directly to the fuel cell. Their applications include small, portable electronics such as phones and laptop computers as well as larger fixed power applications and vehicles.

== Advantages ==
Similar to [[methanol]], formic acid is a small [[organic molecule]] fed directly into the fuel cell, removing the need for complicated [[catalytic reforming]].  Storage of formic acid is much easier and safer than that of [[hydrogen]] because it does not need to be done at high pressures and (or) low temperatures, as formic acid is a non-flammable liquid at [[standard temperature and pressure]]. Formic acid does not cross over the polymer membrane, so its efficiency can be higher than that of methanol. 

== Reactions ==
DFAFCs convert formic acid and [[oxygen]] into [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] to produce energy.  Formic acid oxidation occurs at the [[anode]] on a catalyst layer.  Carbon dioxide is formed and [[protons]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are passed through the polymer membrane to react with oxygen on a catalyst layer located at the [[cathode]].  Electrons are passed through an external circuit from anode to cathode to provide power to an external device.

:Anode: HCOOH → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

:Cathode: 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

:Net reaction: HCOOH + 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

== History ==
During previous investigations, researchers dismissed formic acid as a practical fuel because of the high [[overpotential]] shown by experiments: this meant the reaction appeared to be too difficult to be practical.  However, in 2005 - 2006, other researchers (in particular [[Richard Masel]]'s group at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]) found that the reason for the low performance was the usage of [[platinum]] as a [[catalyst]], as it is common in most other types of fuel cells: using [[palladium]] instead, they claim to have obtained better performance than equivalent [[direct methanol fuel cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = S. Ha, R. Larsen, and R. I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1477">'''Formula Lightning''' was an [[Battery electric vehicle|electric]] type of single-seat [[open-wheel]] [[formula racing]]. Rather unknown to the public, it was held for [[College of Engineering|Colleges of Engineering]] student teams who built and designed these vehicles which were able to reach speeds up to {{convert|143|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and competed on both oval and road course type [[race track]]s.

Each participant in the Formula Lightning series purchased an identical rolling chassis, then designed and built the electric drive system for their vehicle. There were no changes allowed in the chassis design without majority approval of the Formula Lightning Owners Association. This ensured student teams could concentrate on the electric drive without the necessity of designing specialized mechanical chassis components.

These vehicles raced first in 1994 at the [[Grand Prix of Cleveland]] CART race and since then have participated in venues across the country.  The final official series race was held in October 2004 at [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course]].

[[The Ohio State University]] was the leading series champion.

'''GARN''' is an American alternative energy company and manufacturer of smokeless wood-burning furnaces with integrated [[Underfloor_heating#Hydronic_systems|hydronic thermal storage]].

== History ==
GARN pioneered wood [[gasification]] in conjunction with thermal storage in 1984, after GARN founder Martin Lunde developed the technology under a contract with the U.S. Department of Energy in the late 1970s, along with researchers Richard Snyder and James Buesing.&lt;ref&gt;"Here's a hot new way to burn wood," ''Minneapolis Star and Tribune,'' Monday, November 26, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. DOE Contract #DE-FG02-79R510133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Wood-fired boiler stores heat for days," ''Popular Science,'' March 1983, p.28  https://books.google.com/books?id=XARMtUUMxm8C&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;vq=boiler&amp;pg=PA28#v=snippet&amp;q=boiler&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Lunde was awarded patents in wood-fired hydronic storage in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8676">[[Image:Global Earthquake Model Logo.png|thumb|Logo of the public–private initiative Global Earthquake Model (GEM)]]

The '''Global Earthquake Model (GEM)''' is a [[public–private partnership]] initiated in 2006 by the Global Science Forum of the OECD to develop global, [[open-source software|open-source]] risk assessment software and tools. With committed backing from [[academia]], governments and industry, GEM contributes to achieving profound, lasting reductions in [[earthquake]] risk worldwide by following the priorities of the Hyogo Framework for Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.unisdr.org/eng/hfa/hfa.htm | title=Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) - UNISDR}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009 to 2013 GEM is constructing its first working global earthquake model and will provide an authoritative standard for calculating and communicating earthquake risk worldwide.

Since March 2009, GEM is a legal entity in the form of a non-profit foundation based in Pavia, Italy. The GEM Secretariat is hosted at the European Centre for Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering (EUCENTRE). The current secretary general is John Schneider.

== Mission ==

Between 2000 and 2010 over half a million people died due to earthquakes and [[tsunamis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/world_deaths.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011012207/http://www.earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/world_deaths.php |archivedate=2008-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of these in the developing world, where risks increase due to rapid population growth and [[urbanization]].&lt;ref&gt;see a.o. http://www.geohazards.no/projects/project3_08/project_3_earthq.htm - figure2&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many earthquake-prone regions no [[risk model]]s exist, and even where models do exist, they are inaccessible. Better risk-awareness can reduce the toll that earthquakes take by leading to better construction, improved emergency response, and greater access to insurance.

GEM will provide a basis for comparing earthquake risks across regions and across borders, and thereby take the necessary first step towards increased awareness and actions that reduce earthquake risk. GEM tools will be usable at the community, national and international level for uniform earthquake risk-evaluation and as a defensible basis for risk-mitigation plans. GEM results will be disseminated all over the world. GEM will build technical capacity and carry out awareness-raising activities.

== Scientific framework ==

The GEM scientific framework serves as the underlying basis for constructing the global earthquake model, and is organised in three principal integrated modules: [[seismic hazard]], [[seismic risk]] and socio-economic impact.

* The hazard module calculates harmonised probabilities of earthquake occurrence and resulting shaking at any given location.
* The risk module calculates damage and direct losses resulting from this damage such as fatalities, injuries and cost of repair. Damage due to strong ground shaking is calculated by combining building vulnerability, population vulnerability and exposure. GEM will furthermore develop remote-sensing and crowd-data collection techniques to classify, monitor and regularly update building inventory and thus regional vulnerability.
* The socio-economic impact module of GEM will provide tools and indices to both estimate and communicate the impact from earthquakes on the economy and society, concentrating in particular on indirect losses. For example, the impact on a company's revenue, on budgets, on poverty. The module will allow for calculations of scenarios which that enable cost/benefit analysis of mitigating actions, such as systematic building strengthening, and facilitate insurance and [[alternative risk transfer]].

== Implementation ==

It will take five years to build the first working global earthquake model – including corresponding tools, software and datasets. The work started in 2009 and will be finished at the end of 2013. Construction occurs in various stages that are partly overlapping in time. The pilot project GEM1 (January 2009 – March 2010) generates GEM’s first products and initial model building infrastructure, Global components will establish a common set of definitions, strategies, standards, quality criteria and formats for the compilation of databases that serve as an input to the global earthquake model. They are addressed by international consortia that respond to calls for proposals on [[Seismic hazard|hazard]], [[Seismic risk|risk]] and socio-economic impact. Global components will provide preliminary data on a global scale, but on a local scale, regional and national programmes will provide more detailed and reliable data. One Global component was the Global GMPEs project that proposed a set of [[Engineering Seismology|ground motion prediction equations]] for use when calculating [[seismic hazard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Jonathan P.|last2=Douglas|first2=John|last3=Javanbarg|first3=Mohammad|last4=Bozorgnia|first4=Yousef|last5=Abrahamson|first5=Norman A.|last6=Boore|first6=David M.|last7=Campbell|first7=Kenneth W.|last8=Delavaud|first8=Elise|last9=Erdik|first9=Mustafa|date=2015-02-01|title=Selection of Ground Motion Prediction Equations for the Global Earthquake Model|journal=Earthquake Spectra|language=EN|volume=31|issue=1|pages=19–45|doi=10.1193/013013eqs017m|url=https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/53375/1/Stewart_etal_ES_2015_Selection_of_ground_motion_prediction_equations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The data produced on a regional and national scale will be carefully quality-controlled and integrated into the global models. The actual development of the model will occur using a common, web-based platform for dynamic  sharing of tools and resources, in order to create software and online tools as end-products. The global earthquake model will be tested and evaluated before its official release; the testing procedure will involve the establishment of scientific experiments that are reproducible, transparent, and set up within a controlled environment.

GEM is however more than the creation and release of this first version of the model. GEM strives for continuous improvement of the model and will ensure that results are disseminated, technology is transferred through training and workshops and that awareness raising activities are deployed in order to contribute to risk reduction worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1082">The [[Northrop Grumman]] '''High Energy Laser for Rockets, Artillery and Mortars''' (HELRAM) system is a ground-based [[directed energy weapon]] intended to be used mainly against short-range ballistic targets.

It is supposed to be able to shoot down mortar bombs, rocket-propelled mortar bombs, artillery shells and artillery rockets by pointing a high-energy [[laser]] beam at them, thereby causing them to explode in the air.

Northrop Grumman unveiled the HELRAM concept in October 2004, saying that it "could be available within 18 months of a contract".

Its technology is based on that of the [[THEL]] system.

[[File:Alfred LeBlanc congratulated.jpg|thumb|[[Alfred Leblanc]] in airplane, being congratulated by Deutsch de la Meurthe, in [[Nancy, France]] after the [[Circuit de l'Est d'Aviation]] ]]
'''Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe''' (1846, [[Paris]] – 1919), born '''Salomon Henry Deutsch''', was a successful [[France|French]] [[petroleum]] businessman (known as the "Oil King of Europe"&lt;ref name=w&amp;o&gt;Howard, Fred, ''Wilbur &amp; Orville: A Biography'', Dover Publications. Viewable [https://books.google.com/books?id=zw_wlOqHpKgC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=Henri+Deutsch+de+la+Meurthe&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QmCV7J-MDR&amp;sig=o3If1Q1VBTvsjm06DlD8kIEepzM#PPA218,M1 online]&lt;/ref&gt;) and an avid supporter of early [[aviation]]. He sponsored a number of prizes to encourage the development of aviation technologies, including the '''''Grand Prix d'Aviation''''' and the '''''Deutsch de la Meurthe prize'''''.

==Early life, family and name==
The Deutsch de la Meurthe was a French family known for its wealth and patronage in technology and philanthropy, having helped develop the industrial oils industry in France. In 1845 Alexander Deutsch founded a company  for the processing and marketing of [[vegetable oil]]s in [[La Villette, Calvados|La Villette]], then an independent commune of [[Paris]]. With the discovery of petroleum oil in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1859, Deutsch began to study and develop the use of petroleum oils in France. In 1877 Deutsch brought his two sons, Henri and Emile, into the family business, which bought a refinery in [[Rouen]] in 1881 and another in St. Loubès in [[Gironde]] in 1883. In 1889, in association with the [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] brothers, oil refining  began in Spain. At this time Alexander added the "de la Meurthe" to the family name.

==Career==
Henri recognized that the future of petroleum sales depended on the development of small [[internal-combustion engine]]s, and so he promoted [[automobile]] development (he presented French President [[Marie François Sadi Carnot]] with an automobile) and also became interested in aviation.&lt;ref name=crouch&gt;Crouch, Tom D. ''The Bishop's Boys'', W. W. Norton and Company. Viewable [https://books.google.com/books?id=ytw11Bmxcz8C&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=Henri+Deutsch+de+la+Meurthe&amp;source=web&amp;ots=I4uveDF0Ou&amp;sig=3MdODfSsjGdkwnRN5Xq_JUOhQWY#PPA249,M1online]&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Ernest Archdeacon]] he founded the ''[[Aéro-Club de France]]'' to promote the new technologies. In order to do this, he used some of his wealth to create a number of monetary prizes as incentives for aviators to achieve certain aviation milestones.

In 1906 Deutsch  entered into a partnership with [[Wilbur Wright]] and [[Hart Berg]] to establish a company in France to supply a Wright aircraft to the French government. Deutsch financed the venture by buying the only block of shares to be sold in France, and used his influence with the French government. The effort fell through, however.&lt;ref name=w&amp;o/&gt;

He supported  [[Lazare Weiller]], who bought the patents of the [[Wright brothers]] and organized demonstration flights piloted by [[Wilbur Wright]] in [[Le Mans]] which began on 8 August 1908. Deutsch de la Meurthe also invested in aircraft builders [[Société Astra]] (1909) and [[Nieuport]] (1911), and commissioned the construction of aircraft, including the [[Blériot XXIV|Blériot XXIV "Limousine]] and the [[Voisin Icare Aero-Yacht|Voisin 'Aero-Yacht']].

At the end of May 1909, Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe offered the [[University of Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ciup.fr/deutsch_de_la_meurthe.htm%26prev%3D/search?q=Henri+Deutsch+de+la+Meurthe&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1GGLS_en-USUS301US304&amp;usg=ALkJrhjxCOx1m1ksyp6fC7AVYztP3lnZ4g University of Paris information (translated)]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a sum of 500,000 francs and an annual pension of 15,000 francs for the creation and maintenance of the ''Institute Aérotechnique'' at [[Saint-Cyr-l'École]], which would continue the theoretical research and development of air transport aircraft. It was later integrated into the [[Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers]].&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics 1912"&gt;''[[Popular Mechanics]]''. [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=_d0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false September 1912, page 405]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an enthusiastic promoter of heavier-than air flight, De la Meurthe did not make his first flight in an airplane until May 1911, when he was taken for a flight in a Blériot monoplane piloted by Alfred Leblanc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1911/1911%20-%200335.htmlM. Deutsch de la Meurthe takes the Air.] [Flight Ihnterenational 15 May 1911&lt;/ref&gt;
On 21 May 1911, Deutsch was injured and French Minister of War [[Maurice Berteaux]] was killed when a Train monoplane crashed at the beginning of the [[1911 Paris to Madrid air race]].&lt;ref name=century2&gt;[http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/aviation%20timeline/1911_to_1920.htm Century of Flight timeline for 1911]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe was made Commander of the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]] on November 20, 1912.

==Prizes==

===''Deutsch de la Meurthe prize''===
In April 1900, Henri offered the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize, also simply known as the Deutsch prize, of 100,000 francs to the first machine capable of flying a round trip from the [[Parc Saint Cloud]] to the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]] and back in less than thirty minutes. The winner of the prize needed to maintain an average ground speed of at least {{convert|22|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} to cover the round trip distance of {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the allotted time. The prize was to be available from May 1, 1900 to October 1, 1903.&lt;ref name=airship&gt;[http://www.airshipzprize.org/?p=22 ''Airship Deutsch Prize - 1901'', The Airship Z-Prize official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101134108/http://www.airshipzprize.org/?p=22 |date=2009-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To win the prize, [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] decided to build the [[List of Santos-Dumont aircraft#1901|Santos-Dumont No.&amp;nbsp;5]], a  larger airship than his earlier craft. On August 8, 1901 during one of his attempts, the dirigible began to lose hydrogen gas. It started to descend and was unable to clear the roof of the Trocadero Hotel.  Santos-Dumont was left hanging in a basket from the side of the hotel. With the help of the Paris fire brigade he climbed to the roof without injury.

On October 19, 1901, after several attempts and trials, Santos-Dumont launched his [[Santos-Dumont number 6|''Number 6'']] airship at 2:30 pm. After only nine minutes of flight, Santos-Dumont had rounded the Eiffel Tower, but then suffered an engine failure. To restart the engine, he had to climb back over the gondola rail without a safety harness.  The attempt was successful, and he crossed the finish line in 29 minutes 30 seconds.  However, there was a short delay before his mooring line was secured, and at first the adjudicating committee refused him the prize, despite de la Meurthe, who was present, declaring himself satisfied. This caused a public outcry from the crowds watching the flight, as well as comment in the press. However a face-saving compromise was reached, and Santos-Dumont was awarded  the prize. In a charitable gesture, he gave half the prize to his crew and then donated the other half to the poor of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= M. Santos Dumont's Balloon |day_of_week=Monday |date=21 October 1901 |page_number=4 |issue=36591 |column=A |section=News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Grand Prix d'Aviation''===
In 1904, Deutsch de la Meurthe in collaboration with Ernest Archdeacon created the ''Grand Prix d'Aviation'' (also known as the "Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize"), a prize of 50,000 francs for the first person to fly a circular 1-kilometer course in a heavier-than-air craft.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.first-to-fly.com/History/Wright%20Story/prizepatrol.htm |title="Prize Patrol", from Wright Brothers Aeroplane Company, a virtual museum of pioneer aviation |access-date=2008-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312041739/http://www.first-to-fly.com/History/Wright%20Story/prizepatrol.htm |archive-date=2009-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was won on January 13, 1908 by [[Henry Farman]] flying a [[Voisin 1907 biplane|Voisin]] biplane at [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]] in a time of 1 minute 28 seconds, then a distance and speed record since the flights of the [[Wright Brothers]] had not been officially witnessed.&lt;ref name=early&gt;[http://www.earlyaviators.com/efarman.htm ''HENRI FARMAN 1874-1958'' at Early Aviators.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=centennial1&gt;[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Dictionary/Farman/DI82.htm Henri Farman at Centennial of Flight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118042335/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Dictionary/Farman/DI82.htm |date=2009-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe''===

This speed race was held intermittently from 1912-1936, with 20,000 francs offered first by Deutsch, later by the Aéro-Club de France.

'''Henry David Thoreau''' (see [[Henry David Thoreau#Pronunciation of his name|name pronunciation]]; July 12, 1817&amp;nbsp;– May 6, 1862) was an American [[essay]]ist, [[poet]], [[philosopher]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]], [[tax resistance|tax resister]], [[development criticism|development critic]], [[surveying|surveyor]], and [[historian]]. A leading [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]],&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Daniel Walker, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815–1848''. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507894-7}}, p. 623.&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay "[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]" (originally published as "Resistance to Civil Government"), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state.

Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his [[nature writing|writings on natural history]] and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and [[environmental history]], two sources of modern-day [[environmentalism]]. His [[Literary language|literary]] style interweaves close observation of nature, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, [[symbol]]ic meanings, and historical lore, while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical [[Asceticism|austerity]], and Yankee attention to practical detail.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Thoreau, Henry David. ''A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers''&amp;nbsp;/ ''Walden''&amp;nbsp;/ ''The Maine Woods''&amp;nbsp;/ ''Cape Cod''. Library of America. {{ISBN|0-940450-27-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and [[illusion]] in order to discover life's true essential needs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

He was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that attacked the [[fugitive slave laws|Fugitive Slave Law]] while praising the writings of [[Wendell Phillips]] and defending the abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. Thoreau's philosophy of [[civil disobedience]] later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Thoreau is sometimes referred to as an [[anarchism|anarchist]].&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, Edwin Robert Anderson; Johnson, Alvin Saunders, eds. (1937). ''Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gross, David, ed. ''The Price of Freedom: Political Philosophy from Thoreau's Journals''. p. 8. {{ISBN|978-1-4348-0552-2}}. "The Thoreau of these journals distrusted doctrine, and, though it is accurate I think to call him an anarchist, he was by no means doctrinaire in this either."&lt;/ref&gt; Though "Civil Disobedience" seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government—"I ask for, not at once no government, but ''at once'' a better government"&lt;ref name="resistance"&gt;Thoreau, H. D. "[http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p03 Resistance to Civil Government]".&lt;/ref&gt;—the direction of this improvement contrarily points toward anarchism: "'That government is best which governs not at all;' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have."&lt;ref name="resistance" /&gt;

==Pronunciation of his name==
[[Amos Bronson Alcott]] and Thoreau's aunt each wrote that "Thoreau" is pronounced like the word ''thorough'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|ʌr|oʊ}} {{respell|THURR|oh}}—in [[General American]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoreau.eserver.org/pronounce THUR-oh or Thor-OH? And How Do We Know?] ''Thoreau Reader''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/walden/ Thoreau's Walden]'', under the sidebar "Pronouncing Thoreau".&lt;/ref&gt; but more precisely {{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|ɔːr|oʊ}} {{respell|THOR|oh}}—in 19th-century New England). [[Edward Waldo Emerson]] wrote that the name should be pronounced "Thó-row", with the ''h'' sounded and stress on the first syllable.&lt;ref&gt;See the note on pronouncing the name at [http://www.walden.org/Thoreau#Name the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods].&lt;/ref&gt; Among modern-day American speakers, it is perhaps more commonly pronounced {{IPAc-en|θ|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ}} {{respell|thə|ROH}}—with stress on the second syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thoreau|publisher=Dictionary.com|date=2013|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/thoreau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, J. C. (1990) ''Pronunciation Dictionary'', s.v. "Thoreau". Essex, U.K.: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==
Thoreau had a distinctive appearance, with a nose that he called his "most prominent feature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cape Cod|last=Thoreau|first=Henry David|publisher=|year=1865|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 10-A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;His face, once seen, could not be forgotten. The features were quite marked: the nose aquiline or very Roman, like one of the portraits of Caesar (more like a beak, as was said); large overhanging brows above the deepest set blue eyes that could be seen, in certain lights, and in others gray,—eyes expressive of all shades of feeling, but never weak or near-sighted; the forehead not unusually broad or high, full of concentrated energy and purpose; the mouth with prominent lips, pursed up with meaning and thought when silent, and giving out when open with the most varied and unusual instructive sayings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The traditional professions open to college graduates—law, the church, business, medicine—did not interest Thoreau,&lt;ref name="sattelmeyer"&gt;Sattelmeyer, Robert (1988).

Upon graduation Thoreau returned home to Concord, where he met [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] through a mutual friend.&lt;ref name=McElroy/&gt; Emerson, who was 14 years his senior, took a paternal and at times patron-like interest in Thoreau, advising the young man and introducing him to a circle of local writers and thinkers, including [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|Ellery Channing]], [[Margaret Fuller]], [[Amos Bronson Alcott|Bronson Alcott]], and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and his son [[Julian Hawthorne]], who was a boy at the time.

Emerson urged Thoreau to contribute essays and poems to a quarterly periodical, ''[[The Dial]]'', and lobbied the editor, Margaret Fuller, to publish those writings. Thoreau's first essay published in ''The Dial'' was "Aulus Persius Flaccus,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walden.org/documents/file/Library/About%20Thoreau/D/Dial/AulusPersiusFlaccus.pdf|title=Aulus Persius Flaccus|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925021512/http://www.walden.org/documents/file/Library/About%20Thoreau/D/Dial/AulusPersiusFlaccus.pdf|archive-date=September 25, 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an essay on the Roman playwright, in July 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau's_Life_and_Writings:_The_Research_Collections/The_Dial |title=''The Dial'' |publisher=Walden.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018151944/http://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau%27s_Life_and_Writings%3A_The_Research_Collections/The_Dial |archivedate=October 18, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of revised passages from his journal, which he had begun keeping at Emerson's suggestion. The first journal entry, on October 22, 1837, reads, "'What are you doing now?' he asked. 'Do you keep a journal?' So I make my first entry to-day."&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David (2007). ''I to Myself: An Annotated Selection from the Journal of Henry D. Thoreau''. Jeffrey S. Cramer, ed. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoreau was a philosopher of nature and its relation to the human condition. In his early years he followed [[Transcendentalism]], a loose and eclectic [[Idealism|idealist]] philosophy advocated by Emerson, Fuller, and Alcott. They held that an ideal spiritual state transcends, or goes beyond, the physical and empirical, and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine. In their view, Nature is the outward sign of inward spirit, expressing the "radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts", as Emerson wrote in ''Nature'' (1836).

Thoreau returned to Concord and worked in his family's [[pencil]] factory, which he would continue to do alongside his writing and other work for most of his adult life. He rediscovered the process of making good pencils with inferior [[graphite]] by using clay as the binder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GZ1CuD619GwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance|last=Petroski|first=Henry|publisher=Knopf|year=1992|isbn=9780679734154|location=New York|pages=104–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; This invention allowed profitable use of a graphite source found in [[New Hampshire]] that had been purchased in 1821 by Thoreau's brother-in-law, Charles Dunbar. The process of mixing graphite and clay, known as the Conté process, had been first patented by [[Nicolas-Jacques Conté]] in 1795. The company's other source of graphite had been [[Tantiusques]], a mine operated by Native Americans in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]]. Later, Thoreau converted the pencil factory to produce plumbago, a name for graphite at the time, which was used in the [[electrotyping]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, Randall. (Fall 2005).

Once back in Concord, Thoreau went through a restless period.

Thoreau felt a need to concentrate and work more on his writing. In March 1845, Ellery Channing told Thoreau, "Go out upon that, build yourself a hut, &amp; there begin the grand process of devouring yourself alive. I see no other alternative, no other hope for you."&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 1833.&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, Thoreau embarked on a two-year experiment in [[simple living]] on July 4, 1845, when he moved to a small house he had built on land owned by Emerson in a [[secondary forest|second-growth forest]] around the shores of [[Walden Pond]]. The house was in "a pretty pasture and woodlot" of {{convert|14|acre|m2}} that Emerson had bought,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson.

[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|thumb|Original title page of ''Walden'', with an illustration from a drawing by Thoreau's sister Sophia]]

On July 24 or July 25, 1846, Thoreau ran into the local [[tax collector]], Sam Staples, who asked him to pay six years of delinquent [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]]. Thoreau refused because of his opposition to the [[Mexican–American War]] and [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], and he spent a night in jail because of this refusal. The next day Thoreau was freed when someone, likely to have been his aunt, paid the tax, against his wishes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Rosenwald, Lawrence.

In January and February 1848, he delivered lectures on "The Rights and Duties of the Individual in relation to Government",&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, H. D., letter to Ralph Waldo Emerson, February 23, 1848.&lt;/ref&gt; explaining his tax resistance at the [[Concord Lyceum]]. Bronson Alcott attended the lecture, writing in his journal on January 26:

{{quote|Heard Thoreau's lecture before the Lyceum on the relation of the individual to the State—an admirable statement of the rights of the individual to self-government, and an attentive audience. His allusions to the Mexican War, to Mr. [[Samuel Hoar|Hoar]]'s expulsion from Carolina, his own imprisonment in Concord Jail for refusal to pay his tax, Mr. Hoar's payment of mine when taken to prison for a similar refusal, were all pertinent, well considered, and reasoned. I took great pleasure in this deed of Thoreau's.|Bronson Alcott|''Journals''&lt;ref&gt;Alcott, Bronson (1938). ''Journals''. Boston: Little, Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thoreau revised the lecture into an essay titled "[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Resistance to Civil Government]]" (also known as "Civil Disobedience"). It was published by [[Elizabeth Peabody]] in the ''Aesthetic Papers'' in May 1849. Thoreau had taken up a version of [[Percy Shelley]]'s principle in the political poem "[[The Mask of Anarchy]]" (1819), which begins with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf |title=Morrissociety.org |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105232938/http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Walden Pond, Thoreau completed a first draft of ''[[A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers]]'', an [[elegy]] to his brother John, describing their trip to the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in 1839. Thoreau did not find a publisher for the book and instead printed 1,000 copies at his own expense; fewer than 300 were sold.&lt;ref name="Cheever" /&gt;{{Rp|234}} He self-published the book on the advice of Emerson, using Emerson's publisher, Munroe, who did little to publicize the book.

In August 1846, Thoreau briefly left Walden to make a trip to [[Mount Katahdin]] in [[Maine]], a journey later recorded in "Ktaadn", the first part of ''The Maine Woods''.

Thoreau left Walden Pond on September 6, 1847.&lt;ref name="Cheever" /&gt;{{Rp|244}} At Emerson's request, he immediately moved back to the Emerson house to help Emerson's wife, Lidian, manage the household while her husband was on an extended trip to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thoreausociety.org/_news_abouthdt.htm |title=Thoreausociety.org |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129085846/http://thoreausociety.org/_news_abouthdt.htm |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over several years, as he worked to pay off his debts, he continuously revised the manuscript of what he eventually published as ''[[Walden|Walden, or Life in the Woods]]'' in 1854, recounting the two years, two months, and two days he had spent at Walden Pond. The book compresses that time into a single calendar year, using the passage of the four seasons to symbolize human development. Part [[memoir]] and part spiritual quest, ''Walden'' at first won few admirers, but later critics have regarded it as a classic American work that explores natural simplicity, harmony, and beauty as models for just social and cultural conditions.

The American poet [[Robert Frost]] wrote of Thoreau, "In one book ... he surpasses everything we have had in America."&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Robert (1968). Letter to Wade Van Dore, June 24, 1922, in ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Walden''. Richard Ruland, ed. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall. p. 8. {{LCCN|6814480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American author [[John Updike]] said of the book, "A century and a half after its publication, Walden has become such a totem of the back-to-nature, preservationist, anti-business, civil-disobedience mindset, and Thoreau so vivid a protester, so perfect a crank and hermit saint, that the book risks being as revered and unread as the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;Updike, John (2004). "A Sage for All Seasons". [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/26/classics ''The Guardian''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoreau moved out of Emerson's house in July 1848 and stayed at a house on nearby Belknap Street. In 1850, he and his family moved into a house at [[Thoreau-Alcott House|255 Main Street]], where he lived until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene; Carruth, Gorton (1982).

In the summer of 1850, Thoreau and Channing journeyed from Boston to Montreal and Quebec City. These would be Thoreau's only travels outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weisman|first1=Adam Paul|title=Postcolonialism in North America: Imaginative Colonization in Henry David Thoreau's "A Yankee in Canada" and Jacques Poulin's "Volkswagen Blues"|journal=The Massachusetts Review|date=Autumn 1995|volume=36|issue=3|pages=478–479}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is as a result of this trip that he developed lectures that eventually became ''A Yankee in Canada''.

===Later years, 1851–1862===
[[File:VII. Rowse.jpg|thumb|Thoreau in 1854]]
In 1851, Thoreau became increasingly fascinated with [[natural history]] and narratives of travel and expedition. He read avidly on [[botany]] and often wrote observations on this topic into his journal. He admired [[William Bartram]] and [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Voyage of the Beagle]]''. He kept detailed observations on Concord's nature lore, recording everything from how the fruit ripened over time to the fluctuating depths of Walden Pond and the days certain birds migrated. The point of this task was to "anticipate" the seasons of nature, in his word.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walden.org/documents/file/Library/Thoreau/writings/correspondence/LettersBlake.pdf#page34 Letters to H.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;O.

He became a [[Surveying|land surveyor]] and continued to write increasingly detailed observations on the natural history of the town, covering an area of {{convert|26|sqmi|km2}}, in his journal, a two-million-word document he kept for 24 years. He also kept a series of notebooks, and these observations became the source of his late writings on natural history, such as "Autumnal Tints", "The Succession of Trees", and "Wild Apples", an essay lamenting the destruction of indigenous wild apple species.

Until the 1970s, literary critics{{Who|date=July 2009}} dismissed Thoreau's late pursuits as amateur science and philosophy. With the rise of [[environmental history]] and [[ecocriticism]] as academic disciplines, several new readings of Thoreau began to emerge, showing him to have been both a philosopher and an analyst of ecological patterns in fields and woodlots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorson|first1=Robert M.|title=Walden's Shore: Henry David Thoreau and Nineteenth-Century Science|date=December 6, 2013|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674724785}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Primack|first1=Richard B.|title=Tracking Climate Change with the Help of Henry David Thoreau|url=http://www.elsevier.com/connect/tracking-climate-change-with-the-help-of-henry-david-thoreau|accessdate=23 September 2015|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, his late essay "The Succession of Forest Trees" shows that he used experimentation and analysis to explain how forests regenerate after fire or human destruction, through the dispersal of seeds by winds or animals.

He traveled to [[Canada East]] once, [[Cape Cod]] four times, and Maine three times; these landscapes inspired his "excursion" books, ''[[A Yankee in Canada]]'', ''Cape Cod'', and ''The Maine Woods'', in which travel itineraries frame his thoughts about geography, history and philosophy. Other travels took him southwest to [[Philadelphia]] and New York City in 1854 and west across the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] in 1861, when he visited [[Niagara Falls]], Detroit, Chicago, [[Milwaukee]], [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and [[Mackinac Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David (1970).

After [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]], many prominent voices in the abolitionist movement distanced themselves from Brown or [[Damn with faint praise|damned him with faint praise]]. Thoreau was disgusted by this, and he composed a key speech, ''[[A Plea for Captain John Brown]]'', which was uncompromising in its defense of Brown and his actions. Thoreau's speech proved persuasive: the abolitionist movement began to accept Brown as a martyr, and by the time of the [[American Civil War]] entire armies of the North were [[John Brown's Body|literally singing Brown's praises]]. As a biographer of Brown put it, "If, as Alfred Kazin suggests, without John Brown there would have been no Civil War, we would add that without the Concord Transcendentalists, John Brown would have had little cultural impact."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, David S. (2005). ''John Brown, Abolitionist''. Knopf. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Thoreau contracted [[tuberculosis]] in 1835 and suffered from it sporadically afterwards. In 1860, following a late-night excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm, he became ill with [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau's_Life_and_Writings:_The_Research_Collections/Thoreau,_the_Man About Thoreau: Thoreau, the Man] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620045648/http://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau%27s_Life_and_Writings%3A_The_Research_Collections/Thoreau%2C_the_Man |date=June 20, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoreau.eserver.org/wfchron.html Thoreau Chronology].&lt;/ref&gt; His health declined, with brief periods of remission, and he eventually became bedridden. Recognizing the terminal nature of his disease, Thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works, particularly ''The Maine Woods'' and [[Excursions (anthology)|''Excursions'']], and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of ''A Week'' and ''Walden''. He wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue. His friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death. When his aunt Louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with God, Thoreau responded, "I did not know we had ever quarreled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Simon|last= Critchley|title=The Book of Dead Philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ME-6IKs4a2sC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181 |p= 181|location=New York|publisher= Random House |date=2009|isbn=9780307472632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grave of Henry David Thoreau.jpeg|thumb|Grave of Thoreau at [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery (Concord, Massachusetts)|Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]] in Concord]]
Aware he was dying, Thoreau's last words were "Now comes good sailing", followed by two lone words, "moose" and "Indian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/programs/2008/05/05/|title=The Writer's Almanac|publisher=American Public Media|access-date=June 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708225006/http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/programs/2008/05/05/|archive-date=July 8, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He died on May 6, 1862, at age 44. [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] planned the service and read selections from Thoreau's works, and Channing presented a hymn.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, Barbara L. (2007). ''The Transcendentalists''.

Thoreau's friend [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|William Ellery Channing]] published his first biography, ''Thoreau the Poet-Naturalist'', in 1873.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Channing and another friend, [[Harrison Blake]], edited some poems, essays, and journal entries for posthumous publication in the 1890s. Thoreau's journals, which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death, were first published in 1906 and helped to build his modern reputation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} A new, expanded edition of the journals is under way, published by [[Princeton University Press]]. Today, Thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost American writers, both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics. His memory is honored by the international [[Thoreau Society]] and his legacy honored by the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods, established in 1998 in Lincoln, Massachusetts.

===Nature and human existence===
{{quote|Most of the luxuries and many of the so-called comforts of life are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.| Thoreau&lt;ref&gt;''Walden, or Life in the Woods'' (Chapter 1: "Economy")&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and [[canoeing]], of conserving natural resources on private land, and of preserving wilderness as public land. He was himself a highly skilled canoeist; [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], after a ride with him, noted that "Mr. Thoreau managed the boat so perfectly, either with two paddles or with one, that it seemed instinct with his own will, and to require no physical effort to guide it." &lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Hawthorne, Passages From the American Note-Books, entry for September 2, 1842.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was not a strict vegetarian, though he said he preferred that diet&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Van Wyck. ''The Flowering of New England''. New York: E. P. Dutton and Company, Inc., 1952. p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated it as a means of self-improvement. He wrote in ''Walden'', "The practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble and filth."&lt;ref name="Cheever241"&gt;Cheever, Susan (2006).

[[File:Thoreaus quote near his cabin site, Walden Pond.jpg|thumb|Thoreau's famous quotation, near his cabin site at Walden Pond]]
Thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead he sought a middle ground, the [[pastoral]] realm that integrates nature and culture. His philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in North America. He decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred "partially cultivated country." His idea of being "far in the recesses of the wilderness" of Maine was to "travel the logger's path and the Indian trail", but he also hiked on pristine land. In the essay "Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher" [[Roderick Nash]] wrote, "Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance."&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Roderick. ''Wilderness and the American Mind: Henry David Thoreau: Philosopher''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Of alcohol, Thoreau wrote, "I would fain keep sober always. ... I believe that water is the only drink for a wise man; wine is not so noble a liquor. ... Of all ebriosity, who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes?"&lt;ref name="Cheever241" /&gt;

===Sexuality===
Thoreau [[bachelor|never married]] and was [[childless]]. He strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan. However, his sexuality has long been the subject of speculation, including by his contemporaries. Critics have called him heterosexual, homosexual, or asexual.&lt;ref name=harding/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=18_EHFSqSwwC&amp;lpg=PA68 | title=Millennial Seduction | author=Quinby, Lee | page=68| isbn=978-0801486012 | year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone, man or woman. Some scholars have suggested that homoerotic sentiments run through his writings and concluded that he was homosexual.&lt;ref name=harding&gt;Harding, Walter (1991). "Thoreau's Sexuality".

''Thoreau's Seasons''. University of Massachusetts Press. p. 386, n. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{Green anarchism |expanded=People}}
[[File:John Brown - Treason broadside, 1859.png|thumb|left|John Brown "Treason" Broadside, 1859]]

Thoreau was fervently against [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and actively supported the abolitionist movement.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; He participated in the [[Underground Railroad]], delivered lectures that attacked the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]], and in opposition to the popular opinion of the time, supported radical abolitionist militia leader [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his party.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Furtak|first=Rick|title=Henry David Thoreau|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thoreau/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks after the ill-fated [[raid on Harpers Ferry]] and in the weeks leading up to Brown's execution, Thoreau regularly delivered a speech to the citizens of Concord, Massachusetts, in which he compared the American government to [[Pontius Pilate]] and likened Brown's execution to the [[crucifixion of Jesus Christ]]:

{{quote|Some eighteen hundred years ago Christ was crucified; this morning, perchance, Captain Brown was hung. These are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links. He is not Old Brown any longer; he is an angel of light.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

In ''[[The Last Days of John Brown]]'', Thoreau described the words and deeds of John Brown as noble and an example of heroism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Essays The Last Days of John Brown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222023007/http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau%3A_The_Digital_Collection/Essays |date=December 22, 2010 }} from the Writings of Henry David Thoreau: The Digital Collection&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed Brown and his scheme as "crazy".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Thoreau was a proponent of [[limited government]] and [[individualism]]. Although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have, through self-betterment, the kind of government which "governs not at all", he distanced himself from contemporary "no-government men" ([[anarchists]]), writing: "I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government."&lt;ref name="resistance" /&gt;

Thoreau deemed the evolution from [[absolute monarchy]] to [[limited monarchy]] to [[democracy]] as "a progress toward true respect for the individual" and theorized about further improvements "towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man."&lt;ref name="resistance" /&gt; Echoing this belief, he went on to write: "There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly."&lt;ref name="resistance" /&gt;

It is on this basis that Thoreau could so strongly inveigh against British and Catholic power in ''A Yankee in Canada''. Despotic authority had crushed the people's sense of ingenuity and enterprise; the Canadian ''habitants'' had been reduced, in his view, to a perpetual childlike state. Ignoring the recent Rebellions, he argued that there would be no revolution in the St. Lawrence River valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thoreau|first1=Henry David|title=A Yankee in Canada|date=1961|publisher=Harvest House|location=Montreal|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Although Thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent (exemplified in his support for John Brown) and nonviolent (his own example of [[tax resistance]] displayed in ''Resistance to Civil Government''), he regarded [[Pacifism|pacifist]] [[nonresistance]] as temptation to passivity,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Essays The Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222023007/http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau%3A_The_Digital_Collection/Essays |date=December 22, 2010 }} from the Writings of Henry David Thoreau: The Digital Collection&lt;/ref&gt; writing: "Let not our Peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords, or our inability to draw them from their scabbards; but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp."&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Furthermore, in a formal lyceum debate in 1841, he debated the subject "Is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance?", arguing the affirmative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoreau.eserver.org/mjf/MJF1.html Transcendental Ethos] from The Thoreau Reader&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, his condemnation of the [[Mexican–American War]] did not stem from pacifism, but rather because he considered Mexico "unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army" as a means to expand the slave territory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Thoreau was [[ambivalence|ambivalent]] towards [[industrialization]] and [[capitalism]]. On one hand he regarded commerce as "unexpectedly confident and serene, adventurous, and unwearied"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; and expressed admiration for its associated [[cosmopolitanism]], writing:

{{quote|I am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me, and I smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign parts, of coral reefs, and Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the extent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will cover so many flaxen New England heads the next summer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

On the other hand, he wrote disparagingly of the factory system:

{{quote|I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

Thoreau also favored [[bioregionalism]], the protection of animals and wild areas, [[free trade]], and taxation for schools and highways.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; He disapproved of the subjugation of Native Americans, slavery, [[technological utopianism]], [[consumerism]], [[philistinism]], mass entertainment, and frivolous applications of technology.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

===Intellectual interests, influences, and affinities===

====Indian sacred texts and philosophy====
Thoreau was influenced by [[Hindu texts|Indian spiritual thought]]. In ''Walden'', there are many overt references to the sacred texts of India. For example, in the first chapter ("Economy"), he writes: "How much more admirable the [[Bhagvat-geeta|Bhagvat-Geeta]] than all the ruins of the East!"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'' classes him as one of several figures who "took a more [[Pantheism|pantheist]] or [[Pandeism|pandeist]] approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia |author = [[John Lachs]] and [[Robert Talisse]] |date = 2007 |isbn = 978-0415939263 |page = 310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also a characteristic of Hinduism.

Furthermore, in "The Pond in Winter", he equates Walden Pond with the sacred [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganges river]], writing:

[[File:Bhagavata Gita Bishnupur Arnab Dutta 2011.JPG|thumb|right|Krishna teaching Arjuna from ''[[Bhagavata Gita]], ''a text Thoreau read at Walden Pond ]]

{{quote|In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Brahmin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

Thoreau was aware his Ganges imagery could have been factual. He wrote about ice harvesting at Walden Pond. And he knew that New England's [[Ice trade|ice merchants]] were shipping ice to foreign ports, including [[Calcutta]].

Additionally, Thoreau followed various [[Hinduism|Hindu]] customs, including following a [[Rice diet|diet of rice]] ("It was fit that I should live on rice, mainly, who loved so well the philosophy of India."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;), [[Flute-playing|flute playing]] (reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of [[Krishna]]), and [[yoga]].

In an 1849 letter to his friend H.G.O. Blake, he wrote about yoga and its meaning to him:

{{quote|Free in this world as the birds in the air, disengaged from every kind of chains, those who practice yoga gather in Brahma the certain fruits of their works. Depend upon it that, rude and careless as I am, I would fain practice the yoga faithfully. The yogi, absorbed in contemplation, contributes in his degree to creation; he breathes a divine perfume, he hears wonderful things. Divine forms traverse him without tearing him, and united to the nature which is proper to him, he goes, he acts as animating original matter. To some extent, and at rare intervals, even I am a yogi.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Barbara S. "Why Did Henry David Thoreau Take the Bhagavad-Gita to Walden Pond?" ''Parabola'' 12.1 (Spring 1986): 58–63.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Biology====
[[File:Eggs BSNH 1930.png|thumb|right|Bird eggs found by Thoreau and given to the [[Boston Society of Natural History]]. Those in the nest are of [[yellow warbler]], the other two of [[red-tailed hawk]].]]
Thoreau read contemporary works in the new science of biology, including the works of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Asa Gray]] (Charles Darwin's staunchest American ally).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thoreau was deeply influenced by Humboldt, especially his work [[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]].&lt;ref&gt;Wulf, Andrea. ''The Invention of Nature: Alexander Humboldt's New World''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 2015, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, Thoreau purchased and read Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. Unlike many natural historians at the time, including [[Louis Agassiz]] who publicly opposed Darwinism in favor of a static view of nature, Thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of [[evolution by natural selection]] and endorsed it,&lt;ref&gt;Cain, William E. ''A Historical Guide to Henry David Thoreau''. {{ISBN|0195138635}}, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; stating:

{{quote|1=The development theory implies a greater vital force in Nature, because it is more flexible and accommodating, and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation.

{{quote|text=Thoreau's careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time, becoming stronger as the weaknesses Thoreau noted have become more pronounced ...

Thoreau's political writings had little impact during his lifetime, as "his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical," viewing him instead as a naturalist. They either dismissed or ignored his political essays, including ''Civil Disobedience''. The only two complete books (as opposed to essays) published in his lifetime, ''Walden'' and ''A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers'' (1849), both dealt with nature, in which he loved to wander."&lt;ref name=McElroy/&gt; His obituary was lumped in with others rather than as a separate article in an 1862 yearbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|date=1863|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Company|location=New York|page=666|url=https://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n673/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thoreau's writings went on to influence many public figures. Political leaders and reformers like [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]], U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], American civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]], and [[Russian (citizen)|Russian]] author [[Leo Tolstoy]] all spoke of being strongly affected by Thoreau's work, particularly ''Civil Disobedience'', as did "[[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] theorist [[Frank Chodorov]] [who] devoted an entire issue of his monthly, ''Analysis'', to an appreciation of Thoreau."&lt;ref name=Rothbard&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]].

Thoreau also influenced many artists and authors including [[Edward Abbey]], [[Willa Cather]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Upton Sinclair]],&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, W. Barksdale, ''Walden Pond: A History''. Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. B.

The essay galvanized Gandhi, who wrote and published a synopsis of Thoreau's argument, calling its 'incisive logic ... unanswerable' and referring to Thoreau as 'one of the greatest and most moral men America has produced'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy|McElroy, Wendy]] (2011-05-04) [https://mises.org/daily/5250/Here-the-State-Is-Nowhere-to-Be-Seen Here, the State Is Nowhere to Be Seen], [[Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Although he was practicing civil disobedience before he read Thoreau's essay, Gandhi was quick to point out the debt he owed to Thoreau and other thinkers like him".Shawn Chandler Bingham, ''Thoreau and the sociological imagination : the wilds of society''.

I adopted some of them and recommended the study of Thoreau to all of my friends who were helping me in the cause of Indian Independence. Why I actually took the name of my movement from Thoreau's essay 'On the Duty of Civil Disobedience', written about 80&amp;nbsp;years ago."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Webb. I Found No Peace. Garden City, 1938. 238–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] noted in his autobiography that his first encounter with the idea of nonviolent resistance was reading "On Civil Disobedience" in 1944 while attending [[Morehouse College]]. He wrote in his autobiography that it was,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, in this courageous New Englander's refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slavery's territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance. Fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I reread the work several times. I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement; indeed, they are more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a sit-in at lunch counters, a freedom ride into Mississippi, a peaceful protest in Albany, Georgia, a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, these are outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.&lt;ref&gt;King, M.L.

American psychologist B. F. Skinner wrote that he carried a copy of Thoreau's ''Walden'' with him in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F., ''A Matter of Consequences''&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1945, wrote ''[[Walden Two]]'', a fictional utopia about 1,000 members of a community living together inspired by the life of Thoreau.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F., ''Walden Two'' (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau and his fellow [[Transcendentalists]] from [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] were a major inspiration of the composer [[Charles Ives]]. The 4th movement of the [[Concord Sonata]] for piano (with a part for flute, Thoreau's instrument) is a character picture and he also set Thoreau's words.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, James Peter.

Thoreau's ideas have impacted and resonated with various strains in the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement, with [[Emma Goldman]] referring to him as "the greatest American anarchist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Emma Goldman|Goldman, Emma]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5ZYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|title=Anarchism and Other Essays|page=62|year=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green anarchism]] and [[anarcho-primitivism]] in particular have both derived inspiration and ecological points-of-view from the writings of Thoreau. [[John Zerzan]] included Thoreau's text "Excursions" (1863) in his edited compilation of works in the anarcho-primitivist tradition titled ''Against civilization: Readings and reflections''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.fr/dp/toc/0922915989|title=Against Civilization: Readings And Reflections|first=John|last=Zerzan|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Murray Rothbard]], the founder of [[anarcho-capitalism]], has opined that Thoreau was one of the "great intellectual heroes" of his movement.&lt;ref name="Rothbard" /&gt; Thoreau was also an important influence on late-19th-century [[anarchist]] [[naturist|naturism]].&lt;ref name="naturismolibertario"&gt;[http://www.soliobrera.org/pdefs/cuaderno4.pdf#search=%22Antonia%20Maym%C3%B3n%22 El naturismo libertario en la Península Ibérica (1890–1939) by Jose Maria Rosello] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102181805/http://www.soliobrera.org/pdefs/cuaderno4.pdf |date=January 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ortega"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html|title=Anarchism, Nudism, Naturism|first=Carlos |last=Ortega|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, Thoreau's concepts also held importance within [[individualist anarchist]] circles&lt;ref name="spanishind"&gt;[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html "La insumisión voluntaria.

==Criticism==
Although his writings would receive widespread acclaim, Thoreau's ideas were not universally applauded. Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] judged Thoreau's endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of "unmanly" [[effeminacy]] and "womanish solitude", while deeming him a self-indulgent "skulker".&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Robert Louis. [http://thoreau.eserver.org/stevens1.html "Henry David Thoreau: His Character and Opinions"]. Cornhill Magazine. June 1880.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] had mixed feelings about Thoreau. He noted that "He is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which, I suspect, is almost as rare a character as even an original poet; and Nature, in return for his love, seems to adopt him as her especial child, and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness." &lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Hawthorne, ''Passages From the American Note-Books'', entry for September 2, 1842.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he also wrote that Thoreau "repudiated all regular modes of getting a living, and seems inclined to lead a sort of Indian life among civilized men".&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne, ''The Heart of Hawthorne's Journals'', p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borst, Raymond R. ''The Thoreau Log: A Documentary Life of Henry David Thoreau, 1817–1862.'' New York: G.K. Hall, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] detested what he deemed to be the "wicked" and "heathenish" message of ''Walden'', claiming that Thoreau wanted man to "lower himself to the level of a [[woodchuck]] and walk on four legs".&lt;ref&gt;Wagenknecht, Edward. ''John Greenleaf Whittier: A Portrait in Paradox''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1967: 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such criticisms, English novelist [[George Eliot]], writing for the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', characterized such critics as uninspired and narrow-minded:
{{quote|text=People—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every man's life ordered according to a particular pattern, and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them, may pooh-pooh Mr. Thoreau and this episode in his history, as unpractical and dreamy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New England Quarterly]]'', Vol. 6, No. 4 (Dec., 1933), pp. 733–46&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work ''Walden'' by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries:

{{quote|text=I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. ... Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; ... I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau ''Walden'' (1854)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Recent criticism has accused Thoreau of hypocrisy, misanthropy, and being sanctimonious, based on his writings in ''Walden'',&lt;ref name=neworker1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum |title=Henry David Thoreau, Hypocrite |last1=Schultz |first1=Kathryn |date=October 19, 2015 |work=The New Yorker |access-date=October 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019170355/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum |archivedate=October 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective.&lt;ref name=medium1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@TheNewThoreau/why-do-we-love-thoreau-because-he-was-right-175251814c |title=Why do we love Thoreau?

'''Micronization''' is the [[Process (engineering)|process]] of reducing the [[average]] [[diameter]] of a [[solid]] material's particles. Traditional techniques for micronization focus on mechanical means, such as [[Milling (machining)|milling]] and [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]]. Modern techniques make use of the properties of supercritical fluids and manipulate the principles of [[solubility]].

The term micronization usually refers to the reduction of average particle diameters to the [[Micrometre|micrometer]] range, but can also describe further reduction to the [[nanometer]] scale. Common applications include the production of active chemical ingredients, foodstuff ingredients, and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]]. These chemicals need to be micronized to increase efficacy.

==Traditional techniques==
Traditional micronization techniques are based on [[friction]] to reduce particle size. Such methods include [[Milling (grinding)|milling]], bashing and [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]]. A typical industrial mill is composed of a cylindrical metallic drum that usually contains steel spheres. As the drum rotates the spheres inside collide with the particles of the solid, thus crushing them towards smaller diameters. In the case of grinding, the solid particles are formed when the grinding units of the device rub against each other while particles of the solid are trapped in between.

Methods like crushing and [[cutting]] are also used for reducing particle diameter, but produce more rough particles compared to the two previous techniques (and are therefore the early stages of the micronization process). Crushing employs hammer-like tools to break the solid into smaller particles by means of impact. Cutting uses sharp blades to cut the rough solid pieces into smaller ones.

==Modern techniques==
Modern methods use [[supercritical fluids]] in the micronization process. These methods use supercritical fluids to induce a state of [[supersaturation]], which leads to [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of individual particles. The most widely applied techniques of this category include the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions), the SAS method (Supercritical Anti-Solvent) and the PGSS method (Particles from Gas Saturated Solutions). These modern techniques allow for greater tuneability of the process. Parameters like relative pressure and temperature, solute concentration, and antisolvent to solvent ratio are varied to adjust the output to the producer's needs. The supercritical fluid methods result in finer control over particle diameters, distribution of particle size and consistency of morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knez|first=Željko|last2=Hrnčič|first2=Maša Knez|last3=Škerget|first3=Mojca|date=2015-01-01|title=Particle Formation and Product Formulation Using Supercritical Fluids|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-061114-123317|journal=Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering|volume=6|issue=1|pages=379–407|doi=10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-061114-123317|pmid=26091976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tandya|first=A.|last2=Zhuang|first2=H.Q.|last3=Mammucari|first3=R.|last4=Foster|first4=N.R.|title=Supercritical fluid micronization techniques for gastroresistant insulin formulations|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282160941_Supercritical_fluid_micronization_techniques_for_gastroresistant_insulin_formulations|journal=The Journal of Supercritical Fluids|volume=107|pages=9–16|doi=10.1016/j.supflu.2015.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reverchon|first=E.|last2=Adami|first2=R.|last3=Campardelli|first3=R.|last4=Della Porta|first4=G.|last5=De Marco|first5=I.|last6=Scognamiglio|first6=M.|date=2015-07-01|title=Supercritical fluids based techniques to process pharmaceutical products difficult to micronize: Palmitoylethanolamide|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896844615001436|journal=The Journal of Supercritical Fluids|volume=102|pages=24–31|doi=10.1016/j.supflu.2015.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the relatively low pressure involved, many supercritical fluid methods can incorporate thermolabile materials. Modern techniques involve renewable, nonflammable and nontoxic chemicals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esfandiari|first=Nadia|last2=Ghoreishi|first2=Seyyed M.|date=2015-12-01|title=Ampicillin Nanoparticles Production via Supercritical CO2 Gas Antisolvent Process|journal=AAPS PharmSciTech|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1263–1269|doi=10.1208/s12249-014-0264-y|issn=1530-9932|pmc=4666252|pmid=25771736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RESS ===
In the case of RESS, the supercritical fluid is used to [[Solvation|dissolve]] the solid material under high pressure and temperature, thus forming a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] supercritical [[Phase (matter)|phase]]. Thereafter, the [[mixture]] is expanded through a nozzle to form the smaller particles. Immediately upon exiting the nozzle, rapid expansion occurs, lowering the pressure. The pressure will drop below supercritical pressure, causing the supercritical fluid - usually [[carbon dioxide]] - to return to the [[gas]] state. This phase change severely decreases the solubility of the mixture and results in precipitation of particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fattahi|first=Alborz|last2=Karimi-Sabet|first2=Javad|last3=Keshavarz|first3=Ali|last4=Golzary|first4=Abooali|last5=Rafiee-Tehrani|first5=Morteza|last6=Dorkoosh|first6=Farid A.|date=2016-01-01|title=Preparation and characterization of simvastatin nanoparticles using rapid expansion of supercritical solution (RESS) with trifluoromethane|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896844615300115|journal=The Journal of Supercritical Fluids|volume=107|pages=469–478|doi=10.1016/j.supflu.2015.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The less time it takes the solution to expand and the solute to precipitate, the narrower the particle size distribution will be. Faster precipitation times also tend to result in smaller particle diameters.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hezave|first=Ali Zeinolabedini|last2=Aftab|first2=Sarah|last3=Esmaeilzadeh|first3=Feridun|date=2010-11-01|title=Micronization of creatine monohydrate via Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solution (RESS)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896844610001671|journal=The Journal of Supercritical Fluids|volume=55|issue=1|pages=316–324|doi=10.1016/j.supflu.2010.05.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SAS ===
In the SAS method, the solid material is dissolved in an organic solvent. The supercritical fluid is then added as an antisolvent, which decreases the [[solubility]] of the system. As a result, particles of small diameter are formed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are various submethods to SAS which differ in the method of introduction of the supercritical fluid into the organic solution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Marco|first=I.|last2=Rossmann|first2=M.|last3=Prosapio|first3=V.|last4=Reverchon|first4=E.|last5=Braeuer|first5=A.|date=2015-08-01|title=Control of particle size, at micrometric and nanometric range, using supercritical antisolvent precipitation from solvent mixtures: Application to PVP|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894715004271|journal=Chemical Engineering Journal|volume=273|pages=344–352|doi=10.1016/j.cej.2015.03.100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PGSS ===
In the PGSS method the solid material is melted and the supercritical fluid is dissolved in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanbirul Haque|first=A. S. M.|last2=Chun|first2=Byung-Soo|date=2016-01-01|title=Particle formation and characterization of mackerel reaction oil by gas saturated solution process|journal=Journal of Food Science and Technology|volume=53|issue=1|pages=293–303|doi=10.1007/s13197-015-2000-3|issn=0022-1155|pmc=4711435|pmid=26787949}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in this case the solution is forced to expand through a nozzle, and in this way nanoparticles are formed. The PGSS method has the advantage that because of the supercritical fluid, the melting point of the solid material is reduced. Therefore, the solid melts at a lower temperature than the normal melting temperature at ambient pressure.

==Applications==
Pharmaceuticals and foodstuff ingredients are the main industries in which micronization is utilized. Particles with reduced diameters have higher dissolution rates, which increases efficacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Progesterone, for example, can be micronized by making very tiny crystals of the progesterone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdxcyber.com/nmood11.htm wdxcyber.com &gt;Progesterone - Its Uses and Effects] Frederick R. Jelovsek MD. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Micronized progesterone is manufactured in a laboratory from plants. It is available for use as [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|HRT]], infertility treatment, treat progesterone deficiency treatment, including dysfunctional [[uterine bleeding]] in premenopausal women. Compounding pharmacies can supply micronized progesterone in sublingual tablets, oil caps, or transdermal creams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project-aware.org/Managing/Hrt/progesterone.shtml project-aware &gt;  Managing Menopause &gt;  HRT &gt;  About Progesterone] Page uploaded September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Creatine is among the other drugs that are micronized.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Molten-carbonate fuel cells''' ('''MCFCs''') are high-temperature [[fuel cell]]s that [[Operating temperature|operate at temperatures]] of 600&amp;nbsp;°C and above.

Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) are currently being developed for [[natural gas]], [[biogas]] (produced as a result of [[anaerobic digestion]] or [[biomass gasification]]), and [[coal]]-based power plants for [[electrical utility]], industrial, and [[military]] applications. MCFCs are high-temperature fuel cells that use an [[electrolyte]] composed of a molten carbonate salt mixture suspended in a porous, chemically inert ceramic matrix of  [[beta-alumina solid electrolyte]] (BASE). Since they operate at extremely high temperatures of 650&amp;nbsp;°C (roughly 1,200&amp;nbsp;°F) and above, non-precious {{dubious|date=October 2014}} [[metal]]s can be used as [[catalyst]]s at the [[anode]] and [[cathode]], reducing costs.&lt;ref name="eere"&gt;

 | accessdate = 2016-03-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Improved efficiency is another reason MCFCs offer significant cost reductions over [[phosphoric acid fuel cell]]s (PAFCs). Molten carbonate fuel cells can reach efficiencies approaching 60%, considerably higher than the 37–42% efficiencies of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant. When the [[waste heat]] is [[Cogeneration|captured and used]], overall fuel efficiencies can be as high as 85%.&lt;ref name="eere"/&gt;

Unlike [[alkaline]], phosphoric acid, and [[polymer]] electrolyte membrane fuel cells, MCFCs don't require an external reformer to convert more energy-dense fuels to [[hydrogen]]. Due to the high temperatures at which MCFCs operate, these fuels are converted to hydrogen within the fuel cell itself by a process called internal reforming, which also reduces cost.&lt;ref name="eere"/&gt;

Molten carbonate fuel cells are not prone to [[Catalyst#Inhibitors, poisons and promoters|poisoning]] by [[carbon monoxide]] or [[carbon dioxide]] — they can even use carbon oxides as fuel — making them more attractive for fueling with gases made from coal. Because they are more resistant to impurities than other fuel cell types, scientists believe that they could even be capable of internal reforming of coal, assuming they can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal, a dirtier [[fossil fuel]] source than many others, into hydrogen. Alternatively, because MCFCs require CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be delivered to the cathode along with the oxidizer, they can be used to electrochemically separate carbon dioxide from the flue gas of other fossil fuel power plants for sequestration.

The primary disadvantage of current MCFC technology is durability. The high temperatures at which these cells operate and the corrosive electrolyte used accelerate component breakdown and corrosion, decreasing cell life. Scientists are currently exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that increase cell life without decreasing performance.&lt;ref name="eere"/&gt;

== Operation ==

=== Background ===
Molten carbonate FCs are a recently developed type of fuel cell that targets small and large energy distribution/generation systems since their power production is in the 0.3-3 MW range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Types of Fuel Cells - Fuel Cell Energy|url = http://www.fuelcellenergy.com/why-fuelcell-energy/types-of-fuel-cells/|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130825093652/http://www.fuelcellenergy.com/why-fuelcell-energy/types-of-fuel-cells/|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2013-08-25|website = www.fuelcellenergy.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operating pressure is between 1-8 atm while the temperatures are between 600-700 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = NFCRC Tutorial: Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC)|url = http://www.nfcrc.uci.edu/3/TUTORIALS/EnergyTutorial/mcfc.html|website = www.nfcrc.uci.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the production of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during reforming of the fossil fuel (methane, natural gas), MCFCs are not a completely green technology, but are promising due to their reliability and efficiency (sufficient heat for co-generation with electricity). Current MCFC efficiencies range from 60-70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Types of Fuel Cells {{!}} Department of Energy|url = http://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/types-fuel-cells#molten|website = energy.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materials ===
Due to the high operating temperatures of MCFC’s, the materials need to be very carefully selected to survive the conditions present within the cell. The following sections cover the various materials present in the fuel cell and recent developments in research.

==== Anode ====
The [[anode]] material typically consists of a [[Porosity|porous]] (3-6 μm, 45-70% material porosity) Ni based alloy. Ni is alloyed with either Chromium or Aluminum in the 2-10% range. These alloying elements allow for formation of LiCrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LiAlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the grain boundaries, which increases the materials' [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] resistance and prevents [[sintering]] of the anode at the high operating temperatures of the fuel cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:12059/FULLTEXT01.pdf|title = The anode and the electrolyte in the MCFC|date = 2007|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = Diva Portal|publisher = |last = Boden|first = Andreas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has looked at using nano Ni and other Ni alloys to increase the performance and decrease the operating temperature of the fuel cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nano Ni layered anode for enhanced MCFC performance at reduced operating temperature|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319914009811|journal = International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|date = 2014-08-04|pages = 12285–12290|volume = 39|issue = 23|doi = 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.253|first = Hoang Viet Phuc|last = Nguyen|first2 = Mohd Roslee|last2 = Othman|first3 = Dongho|last3 = Seo|first4 = Sung Pil|last4 = Yoon|first5 = Hyung Chul|last5 = Ham|first6 = Suk Woo|last6 = Nam|first7 = Jonghee|last7 = Han|first8 = Jinsoo|last8 = Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reduction in operating temperature would extend the lifetime of the fuel cell (i.e. decrease corrosion rate) and allow for use of cheaper component materials. At the same time, a decrease in temperature would decrease ionic conductivity of the electrolyte and thus, the anode materials need to compensate for this performance decline (e.g. by increasing power density). Other researchers have looked into enhancing creep resistance by using a Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al alloy anode to reduce mass transport of Ni in the anode when in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Creep mechanism of porous MCFC Ni anodes strengthened by Ni3Al|journal = AIChE Journal|date = 2006-01-01|issn = 1547-5905|pages = 359–365|volume = 52|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/aic.10630|first = Yun-Sung|last = Kim|first2 = Jun-Heok|last2 = Lim|first3 = Hai-Soo|last3 = Chun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cathode ====
On the other side of the cell, the [[cathode]] material is composed of a porous Ni that is converted to a lithiated nickel oxide (lithium is [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalated]] within the NiO crystal structure). The pore size within the cathode is in the range of 7-15 μm with 60-70% of the material being porous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:9666/FULLTEXT01.pdf|title = Development and Characterisation of Cathode Materials for the Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell|date = 2004|accessdate = 2 November 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Wijayasinghe|first = Athula}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary issue with the cathode material is dissolution of NiO since it reacts with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when the cathode is in contact with the carbonate electrolyte. This dissolution leads to precipitation of Ni metal in the electrolyte and since it is electrically conductive, the fuel cell can get short circuited. Therefore, current studies have looked into the addition of MgO to the NiO cathode to limit this dissolution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The stability of molten carbonate fuel cell electrodes: A review of recent improvements|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261911004545|journal = Applied Energy|pages = 4274–4293|volume = 88|issue = 12|doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.07.009|first = Ermete|last = Antolini|date = December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnesium oxide serves to reduce the solubility of Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the cathode and decreases precipitation in the electrolyte. Alternatively, replacement of the conventional cathode material with a LiFeO2-LiCoO2-NiO alloy has shown promising performance results and almost completely avoids the problem of Ni dissolution of the cathode.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Electrolyte ====
MCFC’s use a liquid [[electrolyte]] (molten carbonate) which consists of a sodium(Na) and potassium(K) carbonate. This electrolyte is supported by a ceramic (LiAlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) matrix to contain the liquid between the electrodes. The high temperatures of the fuel cell is required to produce sufficient ionic conductivity of oxygen through this electrolyte.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Common MCFC electrolytes contain 62% Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 38% K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The mechanism of surface modification of a MCFC anode|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022072897002027|journal = Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry|date = 1998-01-15|pages = 65–68|volume = 441|issue = 1–2|doi = 10.1016/S0022-0728(97)00202-7|first = Baizeng|last = Fang|first2 = Xinyu|last2 = Liu|first3 = Xindong|last3 = Wang|first4 = Shuzhen|last4 = Duan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A greater fraction of Li carbonate is used due to its higher ionic conductivity but is limited to 62% due to its lower gas solubility and ionic diffusivity of oxygen. In addition, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a very corrosive electrolyte and this ratio of carbonates provides the lowest corrosion rate. Due to these issues, recent studies have delved into replacing the potassium carbonate with a sodium carbonate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Materials issues and recent developments in molten carbonate fuel cells|journal = Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry|date = 2012-06-08|issn = 1432-8488|pages = 3123–3146|volume = 16|issue = 10|doi = 10.1007/s10008-012-1771-y|first = A.|last = Kulkarni|first2 = S.|last2 = Giddey}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Li/Na electrolyte has shown to have better performance (higher conductivity) and improves the stability of the cathode when compared to a Li/K electrolyte (Li/K is more [[Base (chemistry)|basic]]). In addition, scientists have also looked into modifying the matrix of the electrolyte to prevent issues such as phase changes (γ-LiAlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to α-LiAlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the material during cell operation. The phase change accompanies a volume decrease in the electrolyte which leads to lower ionic conductivity. Through various studies, it has been found that an alumina doped α-LiAlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matrix would improve the phase stability while maintaining the fuel cell's performance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==MTU fuel cell==
The German company [[MTU Friedrichshafen]] presented an MCFC at the [[Hannover Fair]] in 2006. The unit weighs 2 tonnes and can produce 240&amp;nbsp;kW of electric power from various gaseous fuels, including biogas. If fueled by fuels that contain carbon such as natural gas, the exhaust will contain CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but will be reduced by up to 50% compared to diesel engines running on marine bunker fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120728110356/http://www.dnv.com/publications/dnv_forum/no3-2006/Fuelcelltechnologyintroducesultracleanships.asp MCFC emission] &lt;/ref&gt; The exhaust temperature is 400&amp;nbsp;°C, hot enough to be used for many industrial processes. Another possibility is to make more electric power via a [[steam turbine]]. Depending on feed gas type, the electric efficiency is between 12% and 19%. A steam turbine can increase the efficiency by up to 24%. The unit can be used for [[cogeneration]].

[[File:Four solaire Mont-Louis France.JPG|right|thumb|[[Solar furnace]] of [[Mont-Louis]]]]
The '''Mont-Louis Solar Furnace''' is an experimental [[solar furnace]] - a [[solar thermal energy]] facility that was built in 1949. It was the first facility of its kind in the world, and was a precursor of the [[Odeillo solar furnace|Odeillo Solar Furnace]]. It provides a thermal power of 50&amp;nbsp;kW.

== History ==
The French chemist [[Félix Trombe]] and his team made an initial demonstration of a mirror of DCA in [[Meudon]] in 1946 to show the possibility of reaching high temperatures very quickly using highly concentrated sunlight. The goal was to melt ore and extract very pure substances to make new and more effective [[refractory material]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mont-louis.net/four.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517143040/http://www.mont-louis.net/four.htm |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to do further experiments, the first solar furnace was built in [[Mont-Louis]] in the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;http://four-solaire.fr/historique.htm{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and cooperation ==
The Mont-Louis Solar Furnace is engaged in a process of [[technology transfer]] to the countries of the south; the city of [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]] in [[Morocco]] is participating in this process. The aim is to install in villages, solar ovens that will cook pots, plates for eating bread, building materials, and melt any metal to make pots or tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reseauculturel.fr/articles.asp?lng=FR&amp;id=5011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119125816/http://www.reseauculturel.fr/articles.asp?lng=FR&amp;id=5011 |archivedate=2008-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
The centre gives demonstrations of its work. A guide takes visitors to the heart of the facility to explain the operation and use of the [[solar furnace]]. Applications of simple scientific and educational experiments complement the visit, for example: the concentration of the solar rays to produce temperatures between 2000&amp;nbsp;°C and 3500&amp;nbsp;°C, the ignition of wood, melting of metal, and ceramic cooking. The visit concludes with an overview of technologies that use solar energy: [[solar thermal]], [[solar forge]], [[solar cell]]s, [[solar cookers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capcir-pyrenees.com/articles.asp?id=5506&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NACA airfoils''' are [[airfoil]] shapes for aircraft wings developed by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA). The shape of the NACA airfoils is described using a series of digits following the word "NACA".  The parameters in the numerical code can be entered into equations to precisely generate the cross-section of the airfoil and calculate its properties.

==Four-digit series==
The NACA four-digit wing sections define the profile by:&lt;ref&gt;E.N. Jacobs, K.E. Ward, &amp; R.M. Pinkerton. [http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19930091108 NACA Report No. 460, "The characteristics of 78 related airfoil sections from tests in the variable-density wind tunnel"]. NACA, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

# First digit describing maximum [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] as percentage of the [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]].
# Second digit describing the distance of maximum camber from the airfoil leading edge in tens of percents of the chord.
# Last two digits describing maximum thickness of the airfoil as percent of the chord.&lt;ref&gt;"Fundamentals of aerodynamics", John D. Anderson,Jr, third ed, chap 4&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the NACA 2412 airfoil has a maximum camber of 2% located 40% (0.4 chords) from the leading edge with a maximum thickness of 12% of the chord.

The NACA 0015 airfoil is symmetrical, the 00 indicating that it has no camber. The 15 indicates that the airfoil has a 15% thickness to chord length ratio: it is 15% as thick as it is long.

===Equation for a symmetrical 4-digit NACA airfoil===
[[File:NACA0015 a.png|thumb|right|400px|Plot of a NACA 0015 foil, generated from formula]]

The formula for the shape of a NACA 00xx foil, with "x" being replaced by the percentage of thickness to chord, is:&lt;ref name="Moran_7"&gt;{{Cite book

where:
*''x'' is the position along the chord from 0 to 1.00, (0 to 100%)
*&lt;math&gt;y_t&lt;/math&gt; is the half thickness at a given value of ''x'' (centerline to surface), and
*''t'' is the maximum thickness as a fraction of the chord (so ''t'' gives the last two digits in the NACA 4-digit denomination divided by 100).

Note that in this equation, at (''x''/''c'') = 1 (the trailing edge of the airfoil), the thickness is not quite zero. If a zero-thickness trailing edge is required, for example for computational work, one of the coefficients should be modified such that they sum to zero. Modifying the last coefficient (i.e. to −0.1036) will result in the smallest change to the overall shape of the airfoil. The leading edge approximates a cylinder with a radius of:

:&lt;math&gt;r = 1.1019\   t ^2 \  c.\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics|last=Gordon J. Leishman|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=361|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x_U,y_U)&lt;/math&gt; of the upper airfoil surface, and &lt;math&gt;(x_L,y_L)&lt;/math&gt; of the lower airfoil surface are:

:&lt;math&gt;x_U = x_L = x, \qquad y_U = +y_t, \quad \text{and} \quad y_L = -y_t.&lt;/math&gt;

Symmetrical 4-digit series airfoils by default have maximum thickness at 30% of the chord from the leading edge.

===Equation for a cambered 4-digit NACA airfoil===
[[File:NACA 2412.png|thumb|right|400px|Plot of a NACA 2412 foil.  The camber line is shown in red, and the thickness – or the symmetrical airfoil 0012 – is shown in purple.]]

The simplest asymmetric foils are the NACA 4-digit series foils, which use the same formula as that used to generate the 00xx symmetric foils, but with the line of mean camber bent.  The formula used to calculate the mean camber line is:&lt;ref name="Moran_7"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y_c = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle{\frac{ m}{ p     ^2} \left( 2p\, \left(\frac{x}{c}\right)- \left(\frac{x}{c}\right)^2   \right)}, &amp; 0 \leq x \leq pc \\
\\
\displaystyle{\frac{ m}{(1 - p)^2} \left( (1 - 2p) + 2p\, \left(\frac{x}{c}\right) - \left(\frac{x}{c}\right)^2 \right)}, &amp; pc \leq x \leq c
\end{array} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''m'' is the maximum camber (100 ''m'' is the first of the four digits),
*''p'' is the location of maximum camber (10 ''p'' is the second digit in the NACA xxxx description).

For this cambered airfoil, because the thickness needs to be applied perpendicular to the camber line, the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x_U,y_U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_L,y_L)&lt;/math&gt;, of respectively the upper and lower airfoil surface, become:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~pmarzocc/AE429/The%20NACA%20airfoil%20series.pdf|title=The NACA airfoil series|last=Marzocca|first=Pier|publisher=Clarkson University|format=PDF|accessdate=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    x_U &amp;= x   - y_t\, \sin \theta, \qquad &amp;
    y_U &amp;= y_c + y_t\, \cos \theta, \\
    x_L &amp;= x   + y_t\, \sin \theta, &amp;
    y_L &amp;= y_c - y_t\, \cos \theta,
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;
 \theta = \arctan{ \left( \frac{dy_c}{dx} \right)},
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy_c}{dx} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle{\frac{2m}{p^2} \left(p - \frac{x}{c} \right)}, &amp; 0 \leq x \leq pc \\
\\
\displaystyle{\frac{2m}{(1 - p)^2} \left(p - \frac{x}{c}\right)}, &amp; pc \leq x \leq c
\end{array} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

==Five-digit series==
The NACA five-digit series describes more complex airfoil shapes.&lt;ref&gt;E. N. Jacobs &amp; R. M. Pinkerton 1936 Test in the variable-density wind tunnel of related airfoils having the maximum camber unusually far forward, [http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19930091610 NACA Report No. 537].&lt;/ref&gt; Its format is: LPSTT, where:
* L: a single digit representing the theoretical optimum lift coefficient at ideal angle-of-attack C&lt;sub&gt;LI&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.15*L (this is ''not'' the same as the lift coefficient, ''C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'')
* P: a single digit for the x-coordinate of the point of maximum camber (max camber at x = 0.05*P)
* S: a single digit indicating whether the camber is simple (S=0) or reflex (S=1)
* TT: the maximum thickness in percent of chord, as in a four-digit NACA airfoil code
For example, the NACA 23112 profile describes an airfoil with design lift coefficient of 0.3 (0.15*2), the point of maximum camber located at 15% chord (5*3), reflex camber (1), and maximum thickness of 12% of chord length (12).

The camber-line is defined in two sections:&lt;ref name=Abbott&gt;{{cite book|last=Abbott|first=Ira|title=Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data|year=1959|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0486605869|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y_c = \begin{cases}\frac{k_1}{6}\left\{x^3-3mx^2+m^2(3-m)x\right\}, &amp; 0&lt;x&lt;m \\
\frac{k_1 m^3}{6}(1-x), &amp; m&lt;x&lt;1\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the chordwise location &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the ordinate &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; have been normalized by the chord.  The constant &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that the maximum camber occurs at &lt;math&gt;x=p&lt;/math&gt;; for example, for the 230 camber-line, &lt;math&gt;p=0.3/2=0.15&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m=0.2025&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, constant &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; is determined to give the desired lift coefficient.  For a 230 camber-line profile (the first 3 numbers in the 5 digit series), &lt;math&gt;k_1=15.957&lt;/math&gt; is used.

===Non-reflexed 3 digit camber lines===
3 digit camber lines provide a very far forward location for the maximum camber.

The camber line is defined as:&lt;ref name=Abbott&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;
y_c = \begin{cases}\frac{k}{6} \left( x^3 - 3 r x^2 + r^2 (3-r) x \right)^2, &amp; 0&lt;x&lt;r \\
\frac{k r^3}{6} \left(1-x\right), &amp; r&lt;x&lt;1\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Reflexed 3-digit camber lines===

Camber lines such as 231 makes the negative trailing edge camber of the 230 series profile to be positively cambered.  This results in a theoretical pitching moment of 0.

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{y}{c} = \frac{k_1}{6} \left[ \left(\frac{x}{c}-r \right)^3 - \frac{k_2}{k_1} (1-r)^3 \frac{x}{c} - r^3 \frac{x}{c} + r^3 \right]

==Modifications==
Four- and five-digit series airfoils can be modified with a two-digit code preceded by a hyphen in the following sequence:

# One digit describing the roundness of the leading edge with 0 being sharp, 6 being the same as the original airfoil, and larger values indicating a more rounded leading edge.
# One digit describing the distance of maximum thickness from the leading edge in tens of percent of the chord.

For example, the NACA 1234-05 is a NACA 1234 airfoil with a sharp leading edge and maximum thickness 50% of the chord (0.5 chords) from the leading edge.

In addition, for a more precise description of the airfoil all numbers can be presented as decimals.

==1-series==
A new approach to airfoil design pioneered in the 1930s in which the airfoil shape was mathematically derived from the desired lift characteristics. Prior to this, airfoil shapes were first created and then had their characteristics measured in a [[wind tunnel]]. The 1-series airfoils are described by five digits in the following sequence:
# The number "1" indicating the series
# One digit describing the distance of the minimum pressure area in tens of percent of chord.
# A hyphen.
# One digit describing the lift coefficient in tenths.
# Two digits describing the maximum thickness in percent of chord.
For example, the NACA 16-123 airfoil has minimum pressure 60% of the chord back with a lift coefficient of 0.1 and maximum thickness of 23% of the chord.

==6-series==
An improvement over 1-series airfoils with emphasis on maximizing [[laminar flow]]. The airfoil is described using six digits in the following sequence:

# The number "6" indicating the series.
# One digit describing the distance of the minimum pressure area in tens of percent of chord.
# The subscript digit gives the range of lift coefficient in tenths above and below the design lift coefficient in which favorable pressure gradients exist on both surfaces
# A hyphen.
# One digit describing the design lift coefficient in tenths.
# Two digits describing the maximum thickness as percent of chord.

For example, the NACA 61&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-315 a=0.5 has the area of minimum pressure 10% of the chord back, maintains low drag 0.2 above and below the lift coefficient of 0.3, has a maximum thickness of 15% of the chord, and maintains laminar flow over 50% of the chord.

==7-series==
Further advancement in maximizing laminar flow achieved by separately identifying the low pressure zones on upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. The airfoil is described by seven digits in the following sequence:

# The number "7" indicating the series.
# One digit describing the distance of the minimum pressure area on the upper surface in tens of percent of chord.
# One digit describing the distance of the minimum pressure area on the lower surface in tens of percent of chord.
# One letter referring to a standard profile from the earlier NACA series.
# One digit describing the lift coefficient in tenths.
# Two digits describing the maximum thickness as percent of chord.
# "a=" followed by a decimal number describing the fraction of chord over which laminar flow is maintained. a=1 is the default if no value is given.

For example, the NACA 712A315 has the area of minimum pressure 10% of the chord back on the upper surface and 20% of the chord back on the lower surface, uses the standard "A" profile, has a lift coefficient of 0.3, and has a maximum thickness of 15% of the chord.

==8-series==
[[Supercritical airfoil]]s designed to independently maximize airflow above and below the wing. The numbering is identical to the 7-series airfoils except that the sequence begins with an "8" to identify the series.

The ''Native Vegetation Management: A Framework for action 2002'' is a [[Victoria_(Australia)|Victorian]] strategy which aims to protect, enhance and revegetate Victoria's [[native vegetation]]. The Framework’s main goal is to "achieve a reversal, across the entire landscape of the long-term decline in the extent and quality of native vegetation, leading to a net gain." [http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenlwm.nsf/LinkView/99ADB544789FE7D4CA2571270014671E49A37B2E66E4FD5E4A256DEA00250A3B]. The framework is notable for the inclusion of offsets, which allow authorised [[Land_clearing_in_Australia|land clearing]], providing there is a net gain in [[biodiversity]], and for the fact that a monetary value is being placed on biodiversity. The "habitat hectare" has been defined as the trading currency of the framework, and provides a reliable and repeatable measurement of the quality of the native vegetation when correctly administered by an experienced assessor. [http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/toolbox/templates/pubs/habitat-hectares.pdf]  The trading in "habitat hectares" is a form of [[biodiversity banking]], which occurs in the private market responding to the [[supply and demand]] of the available remnant vegetation.

The act is administered by the Victorian [[Department of Sustainability and Environment]] (DSE).

{{short description|chemical element with atomic number 7}}
{{Use British English|date=January 2018}}
{{Infobox nitrogen|engvar=en-GB}}
'''Nitrogen''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''N''' and [[atomic number]] 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician [[Daniel Rutherford]] in 1772. Although [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] and [[Henry Cavendish]] had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name ''nitrogène'' was suggested by French chemist [[Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal]] in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in [[nitric acid]] and [[nitrate]]s. [[Antoine Lavoisier]] suggested instead the name '''''azote''''', from the Greek άζωτικός "no life", as it is an [[asphyxiant gas]]; this name is instead used in many languages, such as [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as [[hydrazine]], [[azide]]s and [[azo compound]]s.

Nitrogen is the lightest member of [[pnictogen|group 15]] of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. The name comes from the Greek πνίγειν "to choke", directly referencing nitrogen's asphyxiating properties. It is a common element in the [[universe]], estimated at about [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|seventh in total abundance]] in the [[Milky Way]] and the [[Solar System]]. At [[standard temperature and pressure]], two atoms of the element [[chemical bond|bind]] to form '''dinitrogen''', a colourless and odorless [[diatomic molecule|diatomic]] [[gas]] with the formula N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Dinitrogen forms about 78% of [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], making it the most abundant uncombined element. Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in [[amino acid]]s (and thus [[protein]]s), in the [[nucleic acid]]s ([[DNA]] and [[RNA]]) and in the energy transfer molecule [[adenosine triphosphate]]. The [[Composition of the human body|human body contains]] about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The [[nitrogen cycle]] describes movement of the element from the air, into the [[biosphere]] and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere.

Many industrially important compounds, such as [[ammonia]], nitric acid, organic nitrates ([[propellant]]s and [[explosive]]s), and [[cyanide]]s, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong [[triple bond]] in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any [[diatomic molecule]] after [[carbon monoxide]] (CO),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiredchemist.com/chemistry/data/bond_energies_lengths.html Common Bond Energies (D) and Bond Lengths (r)]. wiredchemist.com&lt;/ref&gt; dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into useful [[Chemical compound|compounds]], but at the same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form '''nitrogen gas''' releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial [[fertiliser]]s, and fertiliser nitrates are key [[pollutant]]s in the [[eutrophication]] of water systems.

Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as [[Kevlar]] used in high-strength fabric and [[cyanoacrylate]] used in [[superglue]]. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including [[antibiotic]]s. Many drugs are mimics or [[prodrug]]s of natural nitrogen-containing [[Cell signaling|signal molecules]]: for example, the organic nitrates [[nitroglycerin]] and [[nitroprusside]] control [[blood pressure]] by metabolizing into [[nitric oxide]]. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural [[caffeine]] and [[morphine]] or the synthetic [[amphetamine]]s, act on receptors of animal [[neurotransmitter]]s.

==History==
[[File:Rutherford Daniel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Daniel Rutherford]], discoverer of nitrogen]]
Nitrogen compounds have a very long history, [[ammonium chloride]] having been known to [[Herodotus]]. They were well known by the Middle Ages. [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] knew nitric acid as ''[[aqua fortis]]'' (strong water), as well as other nitrogen compounds such as [[ammonium]] salts and [[nitrate]] salts. The mixture of nitric and [[hydrochloric acid]]s was known as ''[[aqua regia]]'' (royal water), celebrated for its ability to dissolve [[gold]], the king of metals.&lt;ref name=Greenwood406/&gt;

The discovery of nitrogen is attributed to the Scottish physician [[Daniel Rutherford]] in 1772, who called it ''noxious air''.&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, Daniel (1772) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=JxUUAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dissertatio Inauguralis de aere fixo, aut mephitico]" (Inaugural dissertation on the air [called] fixed or mephitic), M.D. dissertation, University of Edinburgh, Scotland.

Ihde, The Development of Modern Chemistry, New York 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that there was a component of air that does not support [[combustion]] was clear to Rutherford, although he was not aware that it was an element. Nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]],&lt;ref&gt;Carl Wilhelm Scheele, [https://archive.org/stream/CarlWilhelmSche00Sche#page/n1/mode/2up ''Chemische Abhandlung von der Luft und dem Feuer''] [Chemical treatise on air and fire] (Upsala, Sweden: Magnus Swederus, 1777; and Leipzig, (Germany): Siegfried Lebrecht Crusius, 1777).  In the section titled "Die Luft muß aus elastischen Flüßigkeiten von zweyerley Art, zusammengesetzet seyn." (The air must be composed of elastic fluids of two sorts), pp. 6–14, Scheele presents the results of eight experiments in which air was reacted with various substances.  He concluded ([https://archive.org/stream/CarlWilhelmSche00Sche#page/12/mode/2up p. 13]):  ''"So viel sehe ich aus angeführten Versuchen, daß die Luft aus 2 von einander unterschiedenen Flußigkeiten bestehe, von welchen die eine die Eigenschaft das Phlogiston anzuziehen gar nicht äussere, die andere aber zur solchen Attraction eigentlich aufgeleget ist und welche zwischen dem 3:ten und 4:ten Theil von der ganzen Luftmasse aus machet."''  (So I see [this] much from the experiments [that were] conducted: that the air consists of two fluids [that] differ from one another, of which the one doesn't express at all the property of attracting phlogiston; the other, however, is capable of such attraction and which makes up between 1/3 and 1/4 part of the entire mass of the air.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Cavendish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Joseph | last = Priestley | title = Observations on different kinds of air |year = 1772 | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 62 | pages = 147–256|doi =10.1098/rstl.1772.0021 }} ; [https://books.google.com/books?id=aBxWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false see p. 225.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Priestley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Joseph | last = Priestley | title = Observations on different kinds of air |year = 1772 | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 62 | pages = 147–256 | doi=10.1098/rstl.1772.0021}} ; see:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=aBxWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "VII.

Nitrogen gas was [[Inert gas|inert]] enough that [[Antoine Lavoisier]] referred to it as "[[wikt:mephitic air|mephitic air]]" or ''azote'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|el|άζωτικός}} (azotikos), "no life".&lt;ref&gt;Lavoisier, Antoine with Robert Kerr, trans., ''Elements of Chemistry'', 4th ed. (Edinburgh, Scotland:  William Creech, 1799), pp. 85–86.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=adYKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  &amp;#91;p. 85&amp;#93;:]  "In reflecting upon the circumstances of this experiment, we readily perceive; that the mercury, during its calcination [i.e., roasting in air], absorbs the salubrious and respirable part of the air, or, to speak more strictly, the base of this respirable part; that the remaining air is a species of mephitis [i.e., a poisonous gas emitted from the earth], incapable of supporting combustion or respiration; … " [https://books.google.com/books?id=adYKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  &amp;#91;p. 86&amp;#93;:]  "I shall afterwards shew, that at least in our climate, the atmospheric air is composed of respirable and mephitic airs, in the proportion of 27 and 73; … "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lavoisier, Antoine with Robert Kerr, trans., ''Elements of Chemistry'', 4th ed. (Edinburgh, Scotland:  William Creech, 1799), [https://books.google.com/books?id=adYKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 101:]  "The chemical properties of the noxious portion of the atmospheric air being hitherto but little known, we have been satisfied to derive the name of its base from its known quality of killing such animals as are forced to breathe it, giving it the name of ''azot'', from the Greek privitive particle α and ξωη, ''vita''; hence the name of the noxious part of atmospheric air is ''azotic gas''."&lt;/ref&gt; In an atmosphere of pure nitrogen, animals died and flames were extinguished. Though Lavoisier's name was not accepted in English, since it was pointed out that almost all gases (indeed, with the sole exception of oxygen) are mephitic, it is used in many languages (French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Albanian, Turkish, etc.; the German ''Stickstoff'' similarly refers to the same characteristic, viz. ''sticken'' "to choke or suffocate") and still remains in English in the common names of many nitrogen compounds, such as [[hydrazine]] and compounds of the [[azide]] ion. Finally, it led to the name "[[pnictogen]]s" for the group headed by nitrogen, from the Greek πνίγειν "to choke".&lt;ref name=Greenwood406&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 406–07&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word nitrogen (1794) entered the language from the French ''nitrogène'', coined in 1790 by French chemist [[Jean-Antoine Chaptal]] (1756–1832),&lt;ref&gt;Chaptal, J. A. and Nicholson, William trans. (1800) ''Elements of Chemistry'', 3rd ed. London, England: C.C. and J. Robinson, vol. 1.  [https://archive.org/stream/elementsofchemis01chap#page/n47/mode/2up  pp. xxxv–xxxvi:]  "In order to correct the Nomenclature on this head [i.e., in this regard], nothing more is necessary than to substitute to [i.e., for] this word a denomination which is derived from the general system made use of; and I have presumed to propose that of Nitrogene Gas.  In the first place, it is deduced from the characteristic and exclusive property of this gas, which forms the radical of the nitric acid.  By this means we shall preserve to the combinations [i.e., compounds] of this substance the received [i.e., prevailing] denominations, such as those of the Nitric Acid, Nitrates, Nitrites, &amp;c."&lt;/ref&gt; from the French ''[[niter|nitre]]'' ([[potassium nitrate]], also called [[saltpeter]]) and the French suffix ''-gène'', "producing", from the [[Greek language|Greek]] -γενής (-genes, "begotten"). Chaptal's meaning was that nitrogen is the essential part of [[nitric acid]], which in turn was produced from niter. In earlier times, niter had been confused with Egyptian "natron" ([[sodium carbonate]])&amp;nbsp;– called νίτρον (nitron) in Greek&amp;nbsp;– which, despite the name, contained no nitrate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nitrogen nitrogen]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved 2011-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest military, industrial, and agricultural applications of nitrogen compounds used saltpeter ([[sodium nitrate]] or potassium nitrate), most notably in [[gunpowder]], and later as [[fertiliser]]. In 1910, [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] discovered that an electrical discharge in nitrogen gas produced "active nitrogen", a [[monatomic]] [[allotrope]] of nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Strutt, R. J. (1911) [http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/85/577/219.full.pdf "Bakerian Lecture. A chemically active modification of nitrogen, produced by the electric discharge,"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society A'', '''85''' (577): 219–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The "whirling cloud of brilliant yellow light" produced by his apparatus reacted with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to produce explosive [[mercury nitride]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lateralscience.co.uk/activen/index.html Lord Rayleigh's Active Nitrogen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101100510/http://www.lateralscience.co.uk/activen/index.html |date=2012-11-01 }}.

For a long time, sources of nitrogen compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. [[Nitrogen fixation]] by industrial processes like the [[Frank–Caro process]] (1895–1899) and [[Haber–Bosch process]] (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, to the extent that half of global [[food production]] (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers.&lt;ref name="Haber100"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ngeo325 | title = How a century of ammonia synthesis changed the world |year = 2008 | last1 = Erisman | first1 = Jan Willem | last2 = Sutton | first2 = Mark A. | last3 = Galloway | first3 = James | last4 = Klimont | first4 = Zbigniew | last5 = Winiwarter | first5 = Wilfried | journal = Nature Geoscience | volume = 1 | issue = 10 | page = 636|bibcode = 2008NatGe...1..636E }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, use of the [[Ostwald process]] (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as [[feedstock]] in the manufacture of [[explosives]] in the [[World war|World Wars]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Ostwald |editor-first=Wilhelm |editorlink=Wilhelm Ostwald |title=Improvements in the Manufacture of Nitric Acid and Nitrogen Oxides |country-code=GB |series-number=190200698 |subscription=|issue-date=March 20, 1902 |publication-date=January 9, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Ostwald |editor-first=Wilhelm |editorlink=Wilhelm Ostwald |title=Improvements in and relating to the Manufacture of Nitric Acid and Oxides of Nitrogen |country-code=GB |series-number=190208300 |subscription= |issue-date=February 26, 1903 |publication-date=December 18, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

===Atomic===
[[File:Neon orbitals.JPG|thumb|upright=1.6|right|The shapes of the five orbitals occupied in nitrogen. The two colours show the phase or sign of the wave function in each region. From left to right: 1s, 2s (cutaway to show internal structure), 2p&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, 2p&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, 2p&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
A nitrogen atom has seven electrons. In the ground state, they are arranged in the electron configuration 1s{{su|p=2}}2s{{su|p=2}}2p{{su|p=1|b=''x''}}2p{{su|p=1|b=''y''}}2p{{su|p=1|b=''z''}}. It therefore has five [[valence electron]]s in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (the p-electrons) are unpaired. It has one of the highest [[electronegativity|electronegativities]] among the elements (3.04 on the Pauling scale), exceeded only by [[chlorine]] (3.16), [[oxygen]] (3.44), and [[fluorine]] (3.98).&lt;ref name=Greenwood411/&gt; Following periodic trends, its single-bond [[covalent radius]] of 71&amp;nbsp;pm is smaller than those of [[boron]] (84&amp;nbsp;pm) and [[carbon]] (76&amp;nbsp;pm), while it is larger than those of oxygen (66&amp;nbsp;pm) and fluorine (57&amp;nbsp;pm). The [[nitride]] anion, N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, is much larger at 146&amp;nbsp;pm, similar to that of the [[oxide]] (O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;: 140&amp;nbsp;pm) and [[fluoride]] (F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;: 133&amp;nbsp;pm) anions.&lt;ref name=Greenwood411/&gt; The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577&amp;nbsp;MJ·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920&amp;nbsp;MJ·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Due to these very high figures, nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry.&lt;ref name=Greenwood550&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 550&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of radial nodes in the 2p subshell is directly responsible for many of the anomalous properties of the first row of the [[p-block]], especially in nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. The 2p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the 2s shell, facilitating [[orbital hybridization|orbital hybridisation]]. It also results in very large electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the 2s and 2p shells, resulting in very high electronegativities. [[Hypervalent molecule|Hypervalency]] is almost unknown in the 2p elements for the same reason, because the high electronegativity makes it difficult for a small nitrogen atom to be a central atom in an electron-rich [[three-center four-electron bond]] since it would tend to attract the electrons strongly to itself. Thus, despite nitrogen's position at the head of group 15 in the periodic table, its chemistry shows huge differences from that of its heavier congeners [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], and [[bismuth]].&lt;ref name=Kaupp&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaupp |first=Martin |date=1 December 2006 |title=The role of radial nodes of atomic orbitals for chemical bonding and the periodic table |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b624/3805138ab8701ce5b4aa580f626992ff2fde.pdf |journal=Journal of Computational Chemistry |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=320–25 |doi=10.1002/jcc.20522 |pmid=17143872 |access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrogen may be usefully compared to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen as well as its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Although each period 2 element from lithium to nitrogen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group from magnesium to sulfur (known as the [[diagonal relationship]]s), their degree drops off quite abruptly past the boron–silicon pair, so that the similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present. Nitrogen resembles oxygen far more than it does carbon with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for [[hydrogen bond]]ing and the ability to form [[coordination complex]]es by donating its [[lone pair]]s of electrons. It does not share carbon's proclivity for [[catenation]], with the longest chain of nitrogen yet discovered being composed of only eight nitrogen atoms (PhN=N–N(Ph)–N=N–N(Ph)–N=NPh). One property nitrogen does share with both its horizontal neighbours is its preferentially forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms, through p&lt;sub&gt;''π''&lt;/sub&gt;–p&lt;sub&gt;''π''&lt;/sub&gt; interactions; thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and thus has very much lower [[melting point|melting]] (−210&amp;nbsp;°C) and [[boiling point]]s (−196&amp;nbsp;°C) than the rest of its group, as the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules are only held together by weak [[van der Waals interaction]]s and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles. This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the [[nitrogen oxide]]s, [[nitrite]]s, [[nitrate]]s, [[nitro compound|nitro-]], [[nitroso]]-, [[azo compound|azo]]-, and [[diazo]]-compounds, [[azide]]s, [[cyanate]]s, [[thiocyanate]]s, and [[imino]]-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. By the same token, however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Greenwood412/&gt;

Nitrogen has two stable [[isotope]]s: &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N. The first is much more common, making up 99.634% of natural nitrogen, and the second (which is slightly heavier) makes up the remaining 0.366%. This leads to an atomic weight of around 14.007&amp;nbsp;u.&lt;ref name=Greenwood411&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 411–12&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these stable isotopes are produced in the [[CNO cycle]] in [[star]]s, but &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N is more common as its neutron capture is the rate-limiting step. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N is one of the five stable [[even and odd atomic nuclei|odd–odd nuclides]] (a nuclide having an odd number of protons and neutrons); the other four are [[deuterium|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H]], &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B, and &lt;sup&gt;180m&lt;/sup&gt;Ta.&lt;ref name="BetheBible"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bethe |first=H.

The relative abundance of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N is practically constant in the atmosphere but can vary elsewhere, due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological [[redox]] reactions and the evaporation of natural [[ammonia]] or [[nitric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciaaw.org/nitrogen.htm |title=Atomic Weight of Nitrogen |author=CIAAW |date=2003|website=ciaaw.org |publisher=CIAAW |access-date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologically mediated reactions (e.g., [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilation]], [[nitrification]], and [[denitrification]]) strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil.

The heavy isotope &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N was first discovered by S. M. Naudé in 1929, soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements [[oxygen]] and [[carbon]] were discovered.&lt;ref name=Greenwood408&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; It presents one of the lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/sigma/index.jsp?as=15&amp;lib=endfb7.1&amp;nsub=10 |title=Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF) Retrieval &amp; Plotting |publisher=National Nuclear Data Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently used in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional [[nuclear spin]] of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a [[quadrupole moment]] that leads to wider and less useful spectra.&lt;ref name=Greenwood411/&gt; &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low [[gyromagnetic ratio]], (only 10.14% that of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H is about 300 times as much as that for &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N at the same magnetic field strength.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;{{cite book| author=Arthur G Palmer| title=Protein NMR Spectroscopy| publisher=Elsevier Academic Press| date=2007 | isbn = 978-0-12-164491-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled [[hydrogen]], carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Greenwood411/&gt; The &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of [[geochemistry]], [[hydrology]], [[paleoclimatology]] and [[paleoceanography]], where it is called [[δ15N|''δ''&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Katzenberg | first=M.

Of the ten other isotopes produced synthetically, ranging from &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;N to &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;N, [[nitrogen-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N]] has a [[half-life]] of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half-lives on the order of seconds (&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;N) or even milliseconds.

The [[radioisotope]] &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;N is the dominant [[radionuclide]] in the coolant of [[pressurised water reactor]]s or [[boiling water reactor]]s during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O (in water) via an [[Np reaction|(n,p) reaction]] in which the &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton.

===Allotropes===
[[File:N2MolecularDiagramCR.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|[[Molecular orbital diagram]] of dinitrogen molecule, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. There are five bonding orbitals and two antibonding orbitals (marked with an asterisk; orbitals involving the inner 1s electrons not shown), giving a total bond order of three.]]
Atomic nitrogen, also known as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a [[radical (chemistry)|triradical]] with three unpaired electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1–2&amp;nbsp;mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.&lt;ref name=Greenwood412&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 412–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the great reactivity of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless [[diamagnetic]] gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at −196&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Greenwood412/&gt; Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, but it will nevertheless react with [[lithium]] metal and some [[transition metal]] complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N [[triple bond]]. Triple bonds have short bond lengths (in this case, 109.76&amp;nbsp;pm) and high dissociation energies (in this case, 945.41&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's chemical inertness.&lt;ref name=Greenwood412/&gt;

There are some theoretical indications that other nitrogen [[oligomers]] and polymers may be possible. If they could be synthesised, they may have potential applications as materials with a very high energy density, that could be used as powerful propellants or explosives.&lt;ref name=Lewars&gt;{{cite book |title=Modeling Marvels: Computational Anticipation of Novel molecules |last=Lewars |first=Errol G. |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |location= |isbn=978-1-4020-6972-7 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6973 |pages=141–63|doi-broken-date=2018-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because they should all decompose to dinitrogen, whose N≡N triple bond (bond energy 946&amp;nbsp;kJ⋅mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) is much stronger than those of the N=N double bond (418&amp;nbsp;kJ⋅mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) or the N–N single bond (160&amp;nbsp;kJ⋅mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;): indeed, the triple bond has more than thrice the energy of the single bond. (The opposite is true for the heavier pnictogens, which prefer polyatomic allotropes.)&lt;ref name=Greenwood483&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; A great disadvantage is that most neutral polynitrogens are not expected to have a large barrier towards decomposition, and that the few exceptions would be even more challenging to synthesise than the long-sought but still unknown [[tetrahedrane]]. This stands in contrast to the well-characterised cationic and anionic polynitrogens [[azide]] ({{chem|N|3|-}}), [[pentazenium]] ({{chem|N|5|+}}), and [[pentazole|pentazolide]] (cyclic aromatic {{chem|N|5|-}}).&lt;ref name=Lewars/&gt; Under extremely high pressures (1.1&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]) and high temperatures (2000&amp;nbsp;K), as produced in a [[diamond anvil cell]], nitrogen polymerises into the single-bonded [[cubic gauche]] crystal structure.

Dinitrogen is able to coordinate to metals in five different ways. The more well-characterised ways are the end-on M←N≡N (''[[hapticity|η]]''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and M←N≡N→M (''[[bridging ligand|μ]]'', bis-''η''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), in which the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation. The less well-characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the triple bond, either as a [[bridging ligand]] to two metal cations (''μ'', bis-''η''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or to just one (''η''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The fifth and unique method involves triple-coordination as a bridging ligand, donating all three electron pairs from the triple bond (''μ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). A few complexes feature multiple N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ligands and some feature N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bonded in multiple ways. Since N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is isoelectronic with [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[acetylene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in [[carbonyl]] compounds, although N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a weaker ''σ''-donor and ''π''-acceptor than CO. Theoretical studies show that ''σ'' donation is a more important factor allowing the formation of the M–N bond than ''π'' back-donation, which mostly only weakens the N–N bond, and end-on (''η''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) donation is more readily accomplished than side-on (''η''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) donation.&lt;ref name=Greenwood412/&gt;

Today, dinitrogen complexes are known for almost all the transition metals, accounting for several hundred compounds. They are normally prepared by three methods:&lt;ref name=Greenwood412/&gt;
# Replacing labile ligands such as [[water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], [[hydride|H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]], or [[carbon monoxide|CO]] directly by nitrogen: these are often reversible reactions that proceed at mild conditions.
# Reducing metal complexes in the presence of a suitable coligand in excess under nitrogen gas. A common choice include replacing chloride ligands by [[dimethylphenylphosphine]] (PMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph) to make up for the smaller number of nitrogen ligands attached than the original chlorine ligands.
# Converting a ligand with N–N bonds, such as hydrazine or azide, directly into a dinitrogen ligand.
Occasionally the N≡N bond may be formed directly within a metal complex, for example by directly reacting coordinated [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with [[nitrous acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but this is not generally applicable. Most dinitrogen complexes have colours within the range white-yellow-orange-red-brown; a few exceptions are known, such as the blue [{Ti(''η''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)].&lt;ref name=Greenwood412/&gt;

===Nitrides, azides, and nitrido complexes===
Nitrogen bonds to almost all the elements in the periodic table except the first three [[noble gas]]es, [[helium]], [[neon]], and [[argon]], and some of the very short-lived elements after [[bismuth]], creating an immense variety of binary compounds with varying properties and applications.&lt;ref name=Greenwood412/&gt; Many binary compounds are known: with the exception of the nitrogen hydrides, oxides, and fluorides, these are typically called [[nitride]]s. Many stoichiometric phases are usually present for most elements (e.g. MnN, Mn&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N, Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N, and Mn&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;N for 9.2 &lt; ''x'' &lt; 25.3). They may be classified as "salt-like" (mostly ionic), covalent, "diamond-like", and metallic (or [[interstitial compound|interstitial]]), although this classification has limitations generally stemming from the continuity of bonding types instead of the discrete and separate types that it implies. They are normally prepared by directly reacting a metal with nitrogen or ammonia (sometimes after heating), or by thermal decomposition of metal amides:&lt;ref name=Greenwood417&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 417–20&lt;/ref&gt;
:3 Ca + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:3 Mg + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (at 900&amp;nbsp;°C)
:3 Zn(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
Many variants on these processes are possible.The most ionic of these nitrides are those of the [[alkali metal]]s and [[alkaline earth metal]]s, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N (Na, K, Rb, and Cs do not form stable nitrides for steric reasons) and M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba). These can formally be thought of as salts of the N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; anion, although charge separation is not actually complete even for these highly electropositive elements. However, the alkali metal [[azide]]s NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and KN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, featuring the linear {{chem|N|3|-}} anion, are well-known, as are Sr(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ba(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Azides of the B-subgroup metals (those in [[group 11 element|groups 11]] through [[chalcogen|16]]) are much less ionic, have more complicated structures, and detonate readily when shocked.&lt;ref name=Greenwood417/&gt;

[[File:Borazin Mesomers.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Mesomeric structures of borazine, (–BH–NH–)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
Many covalent binary nitrides are known. Examples include [[cyanogen]] ((CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[triphosphorus pentanitride]] (P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), [[disulfur dinitride]] (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[tetrasulfur tetranitride]] (S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The essentially covalent [[silicon nitride]] (Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[germanium nitride]] (Ge&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) are also known: silicon nitride in particular would make a promising [[ceramic]] if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the [[boron group|group 13]] nitrides, most of which are promising [[semiconductor]]s, are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and [[silicon carbide]] and have similar structures: their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B–N unit is isoelectronic to C–C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of [[organic chemistry]] finds an echo in boron–nitrogen chemistry, such as in [[borazine]] ("inorganic [[benzene]]"). Nevertheless, the analogy is not exact due to the ease of [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring.&lt;ref name=Greenwood417/&gt;

The largest category of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N, and M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned in the gaps in a metallic cubic or [[hexagonal close-packed]] lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500&amp;nbsp;°C). They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Greenwood417/&gt;

The nitride anion (N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;) is the strongest ''π'' donor known amongst ligands (the second-strongest is O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;). Nitrido complexes are generally made by thermal decomposition of azides or by deprotonating ammonia, and they usually involve a terminal {≡N}&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; group. The linear azide anion ({{chem|N|3|-}}), being isoelectronic with [[nitrous oxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[cyanate]], forms many coordination complexes. Further catenation is rare, although {{chem|N|4|4-}} (isoelectronic with [[carbonate]] and [[nitrate]]) is known.&lt;ref name=Greenwood417/&gt;

===Hydrides===
[[File:Nitrogen electrode potentials.svg|thumb|right|upright=2.3|Standard reduction potentials for nitrogen-containing species. Top diagram shows potentials at pH&amp;nbsp;0; bottom diagram shows potentials at pH&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;ref name=Greenwood434&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 434–38&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Industrially, [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is the most important compound of nitrogen and is prepared in larger amounts than any other compound, because it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilisers. It is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell. The presence of [[hydrogen bonding]] has very significant effects on ammonia, conferring on it its high melting (−78&amp;nbsp;°C) and boiling (−33&amp;nbsp;°C) points. As a liquid, it is a very good solvent with a high heat of vaporisation (enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks), that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high [[dielectric constant]], and is less dense than water. However, the hydrogen bonding in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is weaker than that in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; rather than two in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It is a weak base in aqueous solution ([[acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;]] 4.74); its conjugate acid is [[ammonium]], {{chem|NH|4|+}}. It can also act as an extremely weak acid, losing a proton to produce the amide anion, {{chem|NH|2|-}}. It thus undergoes self-dissociation, similar to water, to produce ammonium and amide. Ammonia burns in air or oxygen, though not readily, to produce nitrogen gas; it burns in fluorine with a greenish-yellow flame to give [[nitrogen trifluoride]]. Reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products. Ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood420&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 420–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other binary nitrogen hydrides are known, but the most important are [[hydrazine]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hydrogen azide]] (HN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, [[hydroxylamine]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0&amp;nbsp;°C, boiling point 113.5&amp;nbsp;°C, density 1.00&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia.&lt;ref name=Greenwood426/&gt; It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.&lt;ref name="Vieira"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Vieira | first = R. |author2=C. Pham-Huu |author3=N. Keller |author4=M. J. Ledoux | year = 2002 | title = New carbon nanofiber/graphite felt composite for use as a catalyst support for hydrazine catalytic decomposition | journal = [[Chemical Communications]] | issue = 9 | pages = 954–55 | doi = 10.1039/b202032g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrazine is generally made by reaction of ammonia with alkaline [[sodium hypochlorite]] in the presence of gelatin or glue:&lt;ref name=Greenwood426&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 426–33&lt;/ref&gt;
:NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + OCl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|N|2|H|5|+}} + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (slow)
:{{chem|N|2|H|5|+}} + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (fast)
(The attacks by hydroxide and ammonia may be reversed, thus passing through the intermediate NHCl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; instead.) The reason for adding gelatin is that it removes metal ions such as Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that catalyses the destruction of hydrazine by reaction with [[chloramine]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl) to produce [[ammonium chloride]] and nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Greenwood426/&gt;

[[Hydrogen azide]] (HN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) was first produced in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid. It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous. It has a disagreeable and irritating smell and is a potentially lethal (but not cumulative) poison. It may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is similarly analogous to the [[hydrohalic acid]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood426/&gt;

===Halides and oxohalides===
[[File:Nitrogen trichloride.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nitrogen trichloride]]]]
All four simple nitrogen trihalides are known. A few mixed halides and hydrohalides are known, but are mostly unstable and uninteresting: examples include NClF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F, NBrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H, NCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H, and NClH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood438&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 438–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Five nitrogen fluorides are known. [[Nitrogen trifluoride]] (NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, first prepared in 1928) is a colourless and odourless gas that is thermodynamically stable, and most readily produced by the electrolysis of molten [[ammonium fluoride]] dissolved in anhydrous [[hydrogen fluoride]]. Like [[carbon tetrafluoride]], it is not at all reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis. Only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent, and it reacts with [[copper]], arsenic, antimony, and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give [[tetrafluorohydrazine]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The cations {{chem|NF|4|+}} and {{chem|N|2|F|3|+}} are also known (the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride-acceptors such as [[arsenic pentafluoride]]), as is ONF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which has aroused interest due to the short N–O distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long N–F bond. Tetrafluorohydrazine, unlike hydrazine itself, can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical NF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;•. [[Fluorine azide]] (FN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is very explosive and thermally unstable. [[Dinitrogen difluoride]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) exists as thermally interconvertible ''cis'' and ''trans'' isomers, and was first found as a product of the thermal decomposition of FN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood438/&gt;

[[Nitrogen trichloride]] (NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a dense, volatile, and explosive liquid whose physical properties are similar to those of [[carbon tetrachloride]], although one difference is that NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is easily hydrolysed by water while CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is not. It was first synthesised in 1811 by [[Pierre Louis Dulong]], who lost three fingers and an eye to its explosive tendencies. As a dilute gas it is less dangerous and is thus used industrially to bleach and sterilise flour. [[Nitrogen tribromide]] (NBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), first prepared in 1975, is a deep red, temperature-sensitive, volatile solid that is explosive even at −100&amp;nbsp;°C. [[Nitrogen triiodide]] (NI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is still more unstable and was only prepared in 1990. Its adduct with ammonia, which was known earlier, is very shock-sensitive: it can be set off by the touch of a feather, shifting air currents, or even [[alpha particle]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood438/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Bowden, F.

Two series of nitrogen oxohalides are known: the nitrosyl halides (XNO) and the nitryl halides (XNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The first are very reactive gases that can be made by directly halogenating nitrous oxide. [[Nitrosyl fluoride]] (NOF) is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent. [[Nitrosyl chloride]] (NOCl) behaves in much the same way and has often been used as an ionising solvent. [[Nitrosyl bromide]] (NOBr) is red. The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar: [[nitryl fluoride]] (FNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitryl chloride]] (ClNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents.&lt;ref name=Greenwood438/&gt;

===Oxides===
{{main|Nitrogen oxide}}
[[File:Nitrogen dioxide at different temperatures.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|right|Nitrogen dioxide at −196&amp;nbsp;°C, 0&amp;nbsp;°C, 23&amp;nbsp;°C, 35&amp;nbsp;°C, and 50&amp;nbsp;°C. {{chem|NO|2}} converts to colourless dinitrogen tetroxide ({{chem|N|2|O|4}}) at low temperatures, and reverts to {{chem|NO|2}} at higher temperatures.]]
Nitrogen forms nine molecular oxides, some of which were the first gases to be identified: N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ([[nitrous oxide]]), NO ([[nitric oxide]]), N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[dinitrogen trioxide]]), NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[nitrogen dioxide]]), N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([[dinitrogen tetroxide]]), N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ([[dinitrogen pentoxide]]), N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O ([[nitrosylazide]]),&lt;ref name=Greenwood443&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 443–58&lt;/ref&gt; and N(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[trinitramide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rahm |first=Martin |last2=Dvinskikh |first2=Sergey V. |last3=Furó |first3=István |last4=Brinck |first4=Tore |date=23 December 2010 |title=Experimental Detection of Trinitramide, N(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1145–48 |doi=10.1002/anie.201007047|pmid=21268214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All are thermally unstable towards decomposition to their elements. One other possible oxide that has not yet been synthesised is [[oxatetrazole]] (N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O), an aromatic ring.&lt;ref name=Greenwood443/&gt;

Nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), better known as laughing gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten [[ammonium nitrate]] at 250&amp;nbsp;°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for [[cream|sprayed canned whipped cream]], and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot be considered to be the [[inorganic anhydride|anhydride]] of [[hyponitrous acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or [[ozone]] at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;↔&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;N=N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=O): above 600&amp;nbsp;°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.&lt;ref name=Greenwood443/&gt;

Nitric oxide (NO) is the simplest stable molecule with an odd number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, it is an important cellular [[signaling molecule]] involved in many physiological and pathological processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10390607|year=1999|last1=Hou|first1=Y. C.|last2=Janczuk|first2=A.|last3=Wang|first3=P. G.|title=Current trends in the development of nitric oxide donors|volume=5|issue=6|pages=417–41|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200&amp;nbsp;°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a ''π''* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the ''cis'' isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.&lt;ref name=Greenwood443/&gt;

Blue dinitrogen trioxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is only available as a solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to [[nitrosonium]] and [[nitrate]] in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form [[nitric acid]]. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and [[USSR]] by the late 1950s. This is because it is a [[hypergolic propellant]] in combination with a [[hydrazine]]-based [[Rocket propellant|rocket fuel]] and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.&lt;ref name=Greenwood443/&gt;

The thermally unstable and very reactive dinitrogen pentoxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is the anhydride of [[nitric acid]], and can be made from it by dehydration with [[phosphorus pentoxide]]. It is of interest for the preparation of explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Talawar, M. B.|title=Establishment of Process Technology for the Manufacture of Dinitrogen Pentoxide and its Utility for the Synthesis of Most Powerful Explosive of Today – CL-20|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|year= 2005| volume =124|issue=1–3| pages =153–64|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2005.04.021|pmid=15979786|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[deliquescent]], colourless crystalline solid that is sensitive to light. In the solid state it is ionic with structure [NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;; as a gas and in solution it is molecular O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N–O–NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Hydration to nitric acid comes readily, as does analogous reaction with [[hydrogen peroxide]] giving [[peroxonitric acid]] (HOONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). It is a violent oxidising agent. Gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide decomposes as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood443/&gt;
:N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NO
:N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + NO {{eqm}} 3 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Oxoacids, oxoanions, and oxoacid salts===
Many nitrogen [[oxoacid]]s are known, though most of them are unstable as pure compounds and are known only as aqueous solution or as salts. [[Hyponitrous acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a weak diprotic acid with the structure HON=NOH (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; 6.9, p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; 11.6). Acidic solutions are quite stable but above pH 4 base-catalysed decomposition occurs via [HONNO]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; to nitrous oxide and the hydroxide anion. [[Hyponitrite]]s (involving the {{chem|N|2|O|2|2-}} anion) are stable to reducing agents and more commonly act as reducing agents themselves. They are an intermediate step in the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, which occurs in the [[nitrogen cycle]]. Hyponitrite can act as a bridging or chelating bidentate ligand.&lt;ref name=Greenwood459&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 459–72&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nitrous acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is not known as a pure compound, but is a common component in gaseous equilibria and is an important aqueous reagent: its aqueous solutions may be made from acidifying cool aqueous [[nitrite]] ({{chem|NO|2|-}}, bent) solutions, although already at room temperature disproportionation to [[nitrate]] and nitric oxide is significant. It is a weak acid with p''K''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; 3.35 at 18&amp;nbsp;°C. They may be [[titration|titrimetrically]] analysed by their oxidation to nitrate by [[permanganate]]. They are readily reduced to nitrous oxide and nitric oxide by [[sulfur dioxide]], to hyponitrous acid with [[tin]](II), and to ammonia with [[hydrogen sulfide]]. Salts of [[hydrazinium]] {{chem|N|2|H|5|+}} react with nitrous acid to produce azides which further react to give nitrous oxide and nitrogen. [[Sodium nitrite]] is mildly toxic in concentrations above 100&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, but small amounts are often used to cure meat and as a preservative to avoid bacterial spoilage. It is also used to synthesise hydroxylamine and to diazotise primary aromatic amines as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood459/&gt;
:ArNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [ArNN]Cl + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Nitrite is also a common ligand that can coordinate in five ways. The most common are nitro (bonded from the nitrogen) and nitrito (bonded from an oxygen). Nitro-nitrito isomerism is common, where the nitrito form is usually less stable.&lt;ref name=Greenwood459/&gt;

[[File:Fuming nitric acid 40ml.jpg|thumb|right|Fuming nitric acid contaminated with yellow nitrogen dioxide]]
[[Nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is by far the most important and the most stable of the nitrogen oxoacids. It is one of the three most used acids (the other two being [[sulfuric acid]] and [[hydrochloric acid]]) and was first discovered by the alchemists in the [[13th century]]. It is made by catalytic oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide, which is oxidised to nitrogen dioxide, and then dissolved in water to give concentrated nitric acid. In the [[United States|United States of America]], over seven million tonnes of nitric acid are produced every year, most of which is used for nitrate production for fertilisers and explosives, among other uses. Anhydrous nitric acid may be made by distilling concentrated nitric acid with phosphorus pentoxide at low pressure in glass apparatus in the dark. It can only be made in the solid state, because upon melting it spontaneously decomposes to nitrogen dioxide, and liquid nitric acid undergoes [[Molecular autoionization|self-ionisation]] to a larger extent than any other covalent liquid as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood459/&gt;
:2 HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} {{chem|H|2|NO|3|+}} + {{chem|NO|3|-}} {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + [NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + [NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
Two hydrates, HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, are known that can be crystallised. It is a strong acid and concentrated solutions are strong oxidising agents, though [[gold]], [[platinum]], [[rhodium]], and [[iridium]] are immune to attack. A 3:1 mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, called ''[[aqua regia]]'', is still stronger and successfully dissolves gold and platinum, because free chlorine and nitrosyl chloride are formed and chloride anions can form strong complexes. In concentrated sulfuric acid, nitric acid is protonated to form [[nitronium]], which can act as an electrophile for aromatic nitration:&lt;ref name=Greenwood459/&gt;
:HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} {{chem|NO|2|+}} + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 {{chem|HSO|4|-}}
The thermal stabilities of [[nitrate]]s (involving the trigonal planar {{chem|NO|3|-}} anion) depends on the basicity of the metal, and so do the products of decomposition (thermolysis), which can vary between the nitrite (for example, sodium), the oxide (potassium and [[lead]]), or even the metal itself ([[silver]]) depending on their relative stabilities. Nitrate is also a common ligand with many modes of coordination.&lt;ref name=Greenwood459/&gt;

Finally, although orthonitric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which would be analogous to [[orthophosphoric acid]], does not exist, the tetrahedral [[orthonitrate]] anion {{chem|NO|4|3-}} is known in its sodium and potassium salts:&lt;ref name=Greenwood459/&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;NaNO3{} + Na2O -&gt;[\ce{Ag~crucible}][\ce{300^\circ C~for~7 days}] Na3NO4&lt;/chem&gt;
These white crystalline salts are very sensitive to water vapour and carbon dioxide in the air:&lt;ref name=Greenwood459/&gt;
:Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + NaOH + NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
Despite its limited chemistry, the orthonitrate anion is interesting from a structural point of view due to its regular tetrahedral shape and the short N–O bond lengths, implying significant polar character to the bonding.&lt;ref name=Greenwood459/&gt;

===Organic nitrogen compounds===
Nitrogen is one of the most important elements in [[organic chemistry]]. Many organic [[functional group]]s involve a [[carbon–nitrogen bond]], such as [[amide]]s (RCONR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[amine]]s (R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N), [[imine]]s (RC(=NR)R), [[imide]]s (RCO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NR, [[azide]]s (RN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[azo compound]]s (RN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R), [[cyanate]]s and [[isocyanate]]s (ROCN or RCNO), [[nitrate]]s (RONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrile]]s and [[isonitrile]]s (RCN or RNC), [[nitrite]]s (RONO), [[nitro compound]]s (RNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitroso compound]]s (RNO), [[oxime]]s (RCR=NOH), and [[pyridine]] derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in [[quaternary ammonium salt]]s, R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and [[pyrrole]] is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an [[aromaticity|aromatic]] ring.&lt;ref name=Jerry&gt;{{JerryMarch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of nitrogen in a [[chemical substance]] can be determined by the [[Kjeldahl method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2008|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6754-9_9066|isbn=978-1-4020-6753-2|title=Encyclopedia of Genetics, Genomics, Proteomics and Informatics|page=1063|chapter=Kjeldahl Method|last1=Rédei|first1=George P}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of [[nucleic acids]], [[amino acid]]s and thus [[protein]]s, and the energy-carrying molecule [[adenosine triphosphate]] and is thus vital to all life on Earth.&lt;ref name=Jerry/&gt;

==Occurrence==
[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Schematic representation of the [[Nitrogen cycle|flow of nitrogen compounds]] through a land environment]]
{{see also|Nitrogen cycle}}

Nitrogen is the most common pure element in the earth, making up 78.1% of the entire volume of the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Greenwood406/&gt; Despite this, it is [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|not very abundant]] in Earth's crust, making up only 19&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million]] of this, on par with [[niobium]], [[gallium]], and [[lithium]]. The only important nitrogen minerals are [[nitre]] ([[potassium nitrate]], saltpetre) and [[sodanitre]] ([[sodium nitrate]], Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.&lt;ref name=Greenwood407&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 407–09&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrogen compounds constantly interchange between the atmosphere and living organisms. Nitrogen must first be processed, or "[[nitrogen fixation|fixed]]", into a plant-usable form, usually ammonia. Some nitrogen fixation is done by lightning strikes producing the nitrogen oxides, but most is done by [[diazotroph]]ic bacteria through enzymes known as [[nitrogenase]]s (although today industrial nitrogen fixation to ammonia is also significant). When the ammonia is taken up by plants, it is used to synthesise proteins. These plants are then digested by animals who use the nitrogen compounds to synthesise their own proteins and excrete nitrogen–bearing waste. Finally, these organisms die and decompose, undergoing bacterial and environmental oxidation and [[denitrification]], returning free dinitrogen to the atmosphere. Industrial nitrogen fixation by the [[Haber process]] is mostly used as fertiliser, although excess nitrogen–bearing waste, when leached, leads to [[eutrophication]] of freshwater and the creation of marine [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]], as nitrogen-driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die. Furthermore, nitrous oxide, which is produced during denitrification, attacks the atmospheric [[ozone layer]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood407/&gt;

Many saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of [[trimethylamine oxide]] to protect them from the high [[osmosis|osmotic]] effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to [[dimethylamine]] is responsible for the early odour in unfresh saltwater fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15186102|date=Jun 2004|author=Nielsen, M.

Nitric oxide's rapid reaction with water in animals results in production of its metabolite [[nitrite]]. Animal [[metabolism]] of nitrogen in proteins, in general, results in [[excretion]] of [[urea]], while animal metabolism of [[nucleic acids]] results in excretion of [[urea]] and [[uric acid]]. The characteristic odour of animal flesh decay is caused by the creation of long-chain, nitrogen-containing [[amine]]s, such as [[putrescine]] and [[cadaverine]], which are breakdown products of the amino acids [[ornithine]] and [[lysine]], respectively, in decaying proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RMPis9OnJxkC&amp;pg=PT121|page=121|title=Digestion, diet, and disease: irritable bowel syndrome and gastrointestinal function|author=Vickerstaff Joneja|author2=Janice M.|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=2004|isbn=978-0-8135-3387-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Nitrogen gas is an [[industrial gas]] produced by the [[fractional distillation]] of [[liquid air]], or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse [[Osmotic pressure|osmosis membrane]] or [[pressure swing adsorption]]). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parkern2.com/_literature_176619/A_Sustainable_Approach_to_the_Supply_of_Nitrogen|title=A Sustainable Approach to the Supply of Nitrogen|last=Froehlich|first=Peter|date=May 2013|website=www.parker.com|publisher=Parker Hannifin Corporation|access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of [[oxygen]] for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1021/ie50569a032|title=Nitrogen Purfication.

Small amounts of the impurities NO and HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are also formed in this reaction. The impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing [[potassium dichromate]].&lt;ref name="labProduction"/&gt; Very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of [[barium azide]] or [[sodium azide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Eremets | first1 = M.

==Applications==

===Gas===
The applications of nitrogen compounds are naturally extremely widely varied due to the huge size of this class: hence, only applications of pure nitrogen itself will be considered here. Two-thirds of nitrogen produced by industry is sold as the gas and the remaining one-third as the liquid. The gas is mostly used as an inert atmosphere whenever the oxygen in the air would pose a fire, explosion, or oxidising hazard. Some examples include:&lt;ref name=Greenwood409/&gt;

Nitrogen is commonly used during sample preparation in [[chemical analysis]]. It is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples. Directing a pressurised stream of nitrogen gas perpendicular to the surface of the liquid causes the solvent to evaporate while leaving the solute(s) and un-evaporated solvent behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0021-9673(01)01466-2|title=Centrifugal concentrator for the substitution of nitrogen blow-down micro-concentration in dioxin/polychlorinated biphenyl sample preparation|year=2002|author=Kemmochi, Y|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|volume=943|pages=295–97|pmid=11833649|last2=Tsutsumi|first2=K.|last3=Arikawa|first3=A.|last4=Nakazawa|first4=H.|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrogen can be used as a replacement, or in combination with, [[carbon dioxide]] to pressurise kegs of some [[beer]]s, particularly [[ale|stouts]] and British [[ale]]s, due to the smaller [[liquid bubble|bubbles]] it produces, which makes the dispensed beer smoother and [[beer head|headier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baxter|first1=E.

===Liquid===
[[File:Nitrogen.ogv|thumb|Air balloon submerged in liquid nitrogen]]
Liquid nitrogen is a [[cryogen|cryogenic liquid]]. When insulated in proper containers such as [[Dewar flask]]s, it can be transported without much [[evaporation|evaporative loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01136404|title=Vessels for the storage and transport of liquid oxygen and nitrogen|author=Kaganer, M.

[[File:A cylinder container, containing liquid nitrogen.jpg|thumb|A container vehicle carrying liquid nitrogen.]]

Like [[dry ice]], the main use of liquid nitrogen is as a [[refrigerant]]. Among other things, it is used in the [[cryopreservation]] of blood, reproductive cells ([[sperm]] and [[ovum|egg]]), and other biological samples and materials. It is used in the clinical setting in [[cryotherapy]] to remove cysts and warts on the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11359389|volume=144|issue=5|title=Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy of common warts: cryo-spray vs. cotton wool bud|date=May 2001|journal=Br.

Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, [[freeze-branding]] livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.&lt;ref name=Greenwood409/&gt;

==Safety==

===Gas===
Although nitrogen is non-toxic, when released into an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an [[Nitrogen asphyxiation|asphyxiation]] hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human [[carotid body]] is a relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/internal/bio-sci/bbsafe/asphyx.htm |title=Biology Safety&amp;nbsp;– Cryogenic materials.

When inhaled at high [[partial pressure]]s (more than about 4 bar, encountered at depths below about 30&amp;nbsp;m in [[scuba diving]]), nitrogen is an anesthetic agent, causing [[nitrogen narcosis]], a temporary state of mental impairment similar to [[nitrous oxide]] intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Fowler|first1=B.|last2=Ackles|first2=K.

Nitrogen dissolves in the [[blood]] and body fats. Rapid decompression (as when divers ascend too quickly or astronauts decompress too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure) can lead to a potentially fatal condition called [[decompression sickness]] (formerly known as caisson sickness or ''the bends''), when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream, nerves, joints, and other sensitive or vital areas.&lt;ref name="DCShx"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acott|first=C.|title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness|journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal|volume=29|issue=2|year=1999 |oclc=16986801|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kindwall"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kindwall|first1=E.

===Liquid===
As a [[cryogenic]] liquid, liquid nitrogen can be dangerous by causing [[cold burn]]s on contact, although the [[Leidenfrost effect]] provides protection for very short exposure (about one second).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Jearl|title=Boiling and the Leidenfrost Effect|journal=Fundamentals of Physics|pages=1–4|url=http://www.wiley.com/college/phy/halliday320005/pdf/leidenfrost_essay.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage. For example, in 2012, a young woman in England had to have her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19878511 Liquid nitrogen cocktail leaves teen in hospital], BBC News, {{#dateformat:October 8, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the liquid-to-gas [[expansion ratio]] of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, a tremendous amount of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006 at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2&amp;nbsp;m off their foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Investigative Report on Chemistry 301A Cylinder Explosion |author=Mattox, Brent S. |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University |format=reprint |url=http://ucih.ucdavis.edu/docs/chemistry_301a.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430205659/http://ucih.ucdavis.edu/docs/chemistry_301a.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vessels containing liquid nitrogen can [[liquid oxygen|condense oxygen]] from air. The liquid in such a vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen (boiling point −183&amp;nbsp;°C, higher than that of nitrogen) as the nitrogen evaporates, and can cause violent oxidation of organic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Liquid Nitrogen Safety|author = Levey, Christopher G.|publisher = Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth|url = http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/microeng/ln2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nuclear exclusion clause''' is a [[Exclusion clause|clause]] which excludes damage caused by [[nuclear and radiation accidents]] from regular insurance policies of, for example, home owners. 

: Example: ''Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is hereby understood and agreed that this policy shall not apply to any loss, damage or expense due to or arising out of, directly or indirectly, nuclear reaction, radiation or [[radioactive contamination]] regardless of how it was caused.''

As operators of nuclear power plants often have [[Vienna Convention on Civil_Liability for Nuclear Damage|limited]] [[Liability insurance|third-party liability]], in the case of a nuclear accident it is possible that private property damage would be covered neither by the operator of the nuclear power plant nor by the property owners' insurance.

There is no nuclear exclusion clause in [[health insurance]] policies.

For many types of trucks, knowing the loaded weight is important for operating safely and maximising payload whilst avoiding fines for overloading. There are two ways that a driver can determine the approximate loaded weight &amp;mdash; either by driving to an [[Truck scales|in-ground scale]], or using '''on-board scales'''. On-board scales use either [[load cell]] technology or pressure readings from [[air suspension]] to calculate the weight on the vehicle axles. Operating the truck at its optimal payload ensures that the owner minimises his running costs whilst maximising his profit.

The convenience of being able to weigh at the loading site is a key factor in the popularity of on-board scales. This ability eliminates the costs associated with using an in-ground scale, such as lost [[hours of service]], scale fees, and driver wages.

==Types==
There are essentially four types of on-board scales currently in use:

===Load cell scales===
Load-cell scales are based on electronic load cell transducers, and can be mechanical or strain-gauge. There is a wide variety of scale types that can be built with load cell technology. Typically load cells are used in payload scales for vehicles with spring suspension.

===Air-suspension PSI gauges===
Air-suspension PSI gauges are used on commercial trucks and semi-trailers where accurate weights are not as critical.

===Air-suspension load scales===
Load scales for air-ride applications that show on-the-ground weight in pounds (LBS) or kilograms (KG) instead of standard PSI. These non-electric gauges are analog (dial-face) with versions that can calibrate for accuracy.

===Electronic scales with PSI sensors===
Electronic scales with PSI sensors measure temperature and pressure changes in a vehicle’s air suspension. It relays this data to a receiver hardwired into the cab, or wirelessly to a handheld unit, which interprets the data and displays an approximate axle weight or gross vehicle weight.

{{Unreferenced|date=November 2010}}
An '''overhead line crossing''' is the crossing of an obstacle&amp;mdash;such as a traffic route, a river, a valley or a strait&amp;mdash;by an [[overhead power line]]. The style of crossing depends on the local conditions and regulations at the time the power line is constructed. Overhead line crossings can sometimes require extensive construction and can also have operational issues. In such cases, those in charge of construction should consider whether a crossing of the obstacle would be better accomplished by an underground or submarine cable.

==Crossings of roads and railway lines==
Overhead line crossings of roads, railway lines, and small- and medium-sized watercourses do not normally require special construction. However, in the first years of overhead line building a scaffold under the line was required, when a railway line or a road was crossed. Later in Germany and some other countries on each end of a powerline crossing of a state-operated railway a [[dead-end tower]] was required, which can still be seen on some old power lines. For overhead line crossings of motorways the pylons must be rebuilt before they wear out, because these demand additional maintenance. If local conditions are appropriate, an overhead line can be implemented by way of a valley bridge. For example, the Koersch valley bridge near [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]], Germany carries the 110 kV, three-phase line of the EnBW AG with 2 circuits. Because of the danger of short circuits from falling objects, undercrossings are typically avoided.

==Crossings of overhead lines at state borders==
[[Image:Powerline_Border_Crossing.JPG|thumb|380 kV-powerline crossing the national border between Bavaria, Germany and the Czech Republic near Waidhaus. The pylon in the foreground stands in Bavaria and the others are in the Czech Republic]]
There is frequently an anchor pylon on each side of the border, particularly if the lines on either side of the border are operated by different companies.  This setup reduces maintenance work, which would otherwise require direct coordination of workers on both sides of the border, and avoids possible authority problems associated with border crossings as much as possible.

==Crossings of other overhead lines==

At crossings of overhead lines by other overhead lines, the two lines must be kept at the necessary safety distances between the lines and the ground. As a rule, the line with the lower voltage passes under the line with higher voltage.  Construction workers try to plan these crossings in such a way that their construction is as economical as possible. This is usually done by leaving unchanged the line that is crossed, if possible. Undercrossings of existing lines are often constructed in proximity to the line's pylons, since this can often be accomplished without raising the existing pylons and while keeping the necessary safety distances between the ground and the other line.

In the course of undercrossings the pylon picture is frequently changed, and because of its small height it is preferable to create an arrangement with conductors in one level. Sometimes at such crossings there can be problems because of the maximum pylon height allowed for flight safety reasons. If it is not possible at a given location for the pylons of the upper line to be built at a necessary height, the line running below it will be rebuilt on smaller pylons or replaced with an underground cable.

A unique{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} undercrossing of two powerlines can be found north of Kincardine at Scotland at 56°5'17"N   3°43'11"W. Here crosses the powerline Kincardine-Tealing two other lines. One of the two circuits of Kincardine-Tealing powerline crosses these lines on two small pylons and the other circuit via an underground cable.

=== Special crossings from overhead lines of other overhead lines ===

There are some crossings between two overhead powerlines, which are unique, either as both lines are of special type or the unique way of implementation

==Overhead line crossings of aerial tramways==
Overhead lines should cross the route of an aerial tramway only above it, if at all.

The necessary protection distances from overhead lines to the ropes of an aerial tramway are subject to regulations concerning the construction of aerial tramways and overhead lines. In the case of an undercrossing of an aerial tramway, the maximum safety distances between the overhead line and the floor of the aerial tramway cab must be followed absolutely.

In principle, over- and undercrossings of aerial tramways are completely regulated. However, frequently at the range of the crossing section, special precautionary measures are taken.  Thus, at overhead line crossings at which the overhead line runs above the rope of the aerial tramway, two catch ropes are occasionally installed to prevent the conductor from falling off the rope of the tramway in case a pylon or insulator were to break.  Alternatively, auxiliary cross-bars can be installed on the pylons of the overhead line under the conductors, which prevent the conductor cables from falling in case of an insulator failure on the aerial tramway. Occasionally, the span field of the line over the aerial ropeway can be scaffolded with a rigid construction along its whole length, or at least for the span which crosses the aerial tramway.

At crossings at which the aerial tramway runs above the power line, the line is frequently installed on special masts in the crossing range, which scaffold the line in the area of the aerial tramway crossing. Such a measure is not necessary according to power line regulations, but it is often done because, in case of aerial tramway failure, it is possible to rescue people from the tram without switching off the overhead line. Such constructions may be seen at 110 kV power line crossings of the Penkenbahn at [[Mayrhofen]], the Patscherkofelbahn at [[Innsbruck]] and south of [[Zermatt]].

==Overhead line crossings of broad rivers and straits==
[[Image:040715 sbr from land 02.jpg|thumb|250px|The two masts of the high level crossing of the [[River Severn]] estuary between [[England]] and [[Wales]], with the [[Severn Bridge]] behind.  These masts are 1.6[[kilometre|km]] (1 [[mile]]) apart: a further 1.2-km line crosses the [[River Wye]] estuary to the left.]]
Overhead line crossings of broad rivers and of straits, if the terrain on both sides is relatively even, frequently consist of four pylons: two particularly substantial anchor pylons for bracing the conductors of the crossing section, and two tall carrying masts to keep the line high over the water. These pylons have broader cross-bars and greater distances between the cross-bars than the other pylons of the line, in order to prevent the conductor cables from striking against each other during strong winds. In contrast to normal pylons, the two carrying masts at both ends of the crossing are frequently equipped with flight safety lamps, and have stairways for easy access to the top.

Overhead line crossings of rivers and straits with spans of over 2&amp;nbsp;km are frequently prohibitively expensive to build and operate; because of the danger of wind-induced oscillatory movements of the conductor cables, it is necessary either to install very large leader distances or to mount insulators between the conductors in the area of the span. Bundle conductors, which are used for almost all extra-high voltage lines, are more susceptible to oscillations from wind forces than single conductors. Therefore, single conductors must be used for the crossing section, which means the crossing section of the power line determines the maximum transmittable power.

Further, one cannot build pylons arbitrarily high at either end of the crossing section, and there is a usually a considerable minimum height because of ships crossing under the line, so there is often a high mechanical tension in the conductors at long spans. This tension requires conductors made largely of steel, which have a worse electrical conductivity than the common overhead line conductors consisting of copper, Aldrey or aluminum-encased steel, and also limits the amount of transmittable electrical power. For this reason, for crossings with a span width of more than approximately 2&amp;nbsp;km, those in charge of construction should consider laying an underwater cable as the more practicable solution.

Alternatively, it might be possible to erect one or more pylons in the water to be crossed. Such crossings can be seen occasionally in North America. They are, however, only used when it is more economical and practical to do so than to lay a cable underwater, such as when the water is not very deep and no large passage heights are needed for vessels. Also, such construction can be very problematic as far as getting legal permission to build, because pylons standing in the water are likely to be considered dangerous obstacles for ships, especially in foggy conditions.

In some cases on bridges small crossing a wider waterway pylons or crossbars for the conductors can be mounted. Such a solution, which may lead to safety problems at bridge maintenance, was for example realized at the Danish [[Storstrøm Bridge]].

It is quite likely that overhead line crossings of broad waters can be replaced with underwater cables. The overhead line crossing the Strait of Messina — which, with a span of 3646 meters, was  one of the longest overhead line crossings in the world, with 200-meter pylons among the highest in the world — was replaced by a submarine cable, because of its small maximum transmittable electrical power.

==Overhead line crossing of valleys==
Overhead line crossings of valleys consist of two anchor pylons, one at either end of the valley. If the topography of the valley is suitable, these do not need to be very high.  In very wide valleys, it is better to use a pylon for each phase in order to achieve sufficient distance between the conductors. In these cases there is frequently a further anchor pylon behind the crossing, used in order to realize the angle change of the conductor cables behind these. The problems associated with large spans also exist in these cases, but these can be easily and economically ameliorated, if the topography does not require high crossing pylons, by using a separate pylon for each conductor.

==Structures==
A ''crossing pylon'' is used for crossing over a body of water or a valley.  Due to the long [[span width|span]], crossing pylons across rivers and sea straits are frequently taller than standard pylons. They may have marking lamps, and unlike standard pylons, often have [[stairway]]s for easy access to the top.  In many cases, their height makes them ideal for carrying [[radio]] antennas and transmitting equipment.

Crossing pylons for valleys, depending on the local topography, are not necessarily tall, but the distance between the conducting cables must be sufficient to prevent high winds knocking the conductors into one another; these pylons have wide crossbars to prevent this.  For very long spans each [[phase (waves)|phase]] has a separate pylon, particularly if the pylons are short.

Special crossing pylons are often used where aerial tramways cross power lines. These pylons are designed with integral scaffolding so that the tramway cars can be reached without touching a live power line.  This enables passengers to be rescued from the tramway if it fails without cutting the power from the power line.  Such installations can be found, for example, south of [[Zermatt]], [[Switzerland]]; at the [[Patscherkofelbahn]] near [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]]; and at the [[Penkenbahn]] in [[Mayrhofen]], [[Austria]].

The '''petroleum industry''', also known as the '''oil industry''' or the '''oil patch''', includes the global processes of [[hydrocarbon exploration|exploration]], [[extraction of petroleum|extraction]], [[oil refinery|refining]], [[Petroleum transport|transporting]] (often by [[oil tanker]]s and [[pipeline transport|pipelines]]), and marketing of [[list of crude oil products|petroleum products]]. The largest volume products of the industry are [[fuel oil]] and [[gasoline]] (petrol). Petroleum (oil) is also the raw material for many [[petrochemical|chemical products]], including [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[solvent]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, [[pesticide]]s, synthetic fragrances, and [[plastic]]s. The extreme monetary value of oil and its products has led to it being known as "black gold".  The industry is usually divided into three major components: [[upstream (petroleum industry)|upstream]], [[midstream]], and [[downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]]. 

Petroleum is vital to many industries, and is necessary for the maintenance of industrial [[civilization]] in its current configuration, making it a critical concern for many nations. Oil accounts for a large percentage of the world’s [[energy consumption]], ranging from a low of 32% for [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], to a high of 53% for the [[Middle East]].

Other geographic regions' consumption patterns are as follows: [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]] (44%), [[Africa]] (41%), and [[North America]] (40%). The world consumes 30 billion [[barrel (unit)|barrels]] (4.8&amp;nbsp;km³) of oil per year, with developed nations being the largest consumers. The [[United States]] consumed 25% of the oil produced in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World Factbook]]''. "Country Comparison - Oil Consumption". Found at https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2174rank.html&lt;/ref&gt; The production, distribution, refining, and retailing of petroleum taken as a whole represents the world's largest industry in terms of dollar value.

Governments such as the United States government provide a heavy public [[Energy_subsidies#Impact_of_fossil_fuel_subsidies|subsidy to petroleum companies]], with major tax breaks at virtually every stage of oil exploration and extraction, including the costs of oil field leases and drilling equipment.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;New York Times, 2010 July 3, "As Oil Industry Fights a Tax, It Reaps Subsidies," https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/business/04bptax.html?_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[enhanced oil recovery]] techniques — most notably multi-stage drilling and hydraulic fracturing, together commonly known as "fracking" — have moved to the forefront of the industry as this new technology plays a crucial and [[Controversies about fracking|controversial]] role in new methods of oil extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-02-01|title=“Fracking” controversy and communication: Using national survey data to understand public perceptions of hydraulic fracturing|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513010392|journal=Energy Policy|language=en|volume=65|pages=57–67|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.10.017|issn=0301-4215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistory===
[[File:Korna natural oil seep 1.JPG|thumb|250px|Natural oil spring in [[Korňa]], [[Slovakia]].]]

Petroleum is a naturally occurring liquid found in rock formations. It consists of a complex mixture of hydrocarbons of various molecular weights, plus other organic compounds. It is generally accepted that oil is formed mostly from the carbon rich remains of ancient plankton after exposure to heat and pressure in [[Earth]]'s crust over hundreds of millions of years. Over time, the decayed residue was covered by layers of mud and silt, sinking further down into Earth’s crust and preserved there between hot and pressured layers, gradually transforming into oil reservoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781439873908|title=The Chemistry and Technology of Petroleum, Fifth Edition|last=Speight|first=James|date=2014-01-30|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439873892|series=Chemical Industries|language=en|doi=10.1201/b16559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
[[Petroleum]] in an unrefined state has been utilized by humans for over 5000 years. Oil in general has been used since early [[history of the world|human history]] to keep fires ablaze and in [[war]]fare.

Its importance to the [[world economy]] however, evolved slowly, with [[whale oil]] being used for lighting in the 19th century and wood and coal used for heating and cooking well into the 20th century. Even though the [[Industrial Revolution]] generated an increasing need for energy, this was initially met mainly by coal, and from other sources including whale oil. However, when it was discovered that [[kerosene]] could be extracted from [[crude oil]] and used as a lighting and heating fuel, the demand for petroleum increased greatly, and by the early twentieth century had become the most valuable commodity traded on world markets.&lt;ref name="Halliday"&gt;Halliday, Fred.

[[Imperial Russia]] produced 3,500 tons of oil in 1825 and doubled its output by mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Krylov, A.A. Bokserman, E.R.Stavrovsky. ''The Oil Industry of the Former Soviet Union''. CRC Press, 1998. P. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; After oil drilling began in what is now [[Azerbaijan]] in 1846 in Baku, two large pipelines were built in the [[Russian Empire]]: the 833&amp;nbsp;km long pipeline to transport oil from the Caspian to the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Batum]] (Baku-Batum pipeline), completed in 1906, and the 162&amp;nbsp;km long pipeline to carry oil from [[Chechnya]] to the Caspian. Batum is renamed to Batumi in 1936.

At the turn of the 20th century, Imperial Russia's output of oil, almost entirely from the [[Apsheron Peninsula]], accounted for half of the world's production and dominated international markets.&lt;ref name = "Shirin"&gt;Shirin Akiner, Anne Aldis.

Sharpe, 1993. P. 463.&lt;/ref&gt; As a side effect of these early developments, the Apsheron Peninsula emerged as the world's "oldest legacy of oil pollution and environmental negligence."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from: Tatyana Saiko. ''Environmental Crises''. Pearson Education, 2000. P. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846, Baku (Bibi-Heybat settlement) the first ever well drilled with percussion tools to a depth of 21 meters for oil exploration. In 1878, [[Ludvig Nobel]] and his [[Branobel]] company "revolutionized oil transport" by commissioning the first [[oil tanker]] and launching it on the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref name = "Shirin"/&gt;

[[Samuel Kier]] established America's first oil refinery in Pittsburgh on Seventh avenue near Grant Street, in 1853. One of the first modern oil refineries were built by [[Ignacy Łukasiewicz]] near [[Jasło]] (then in the dependent [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Central European Galicia]]), Poland in 1854–56.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Frank, Alison Fleig|title=Oil Empire: Visions of Prosperity in Austrian Galicia (Harvard Historical Studies)|edition=|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-674-01887-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were initially small, as demand for refined fuel was limited. The refined products were used in artificial asphalt, machine oil and lubricants, in addition to Łukasiewicz's kerosene lamp. As kerosene lamps gained popularity, the refining industry grew in the area.

The [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada#Early origins|first commercial oil well]] in Canada became operational in 1858 at [[Oil Springs, Ontario]] (then [[Canada West]]).&lt;ref name="lclmg.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lclmg.org/lclmg/Museums/OilMuseumofCanada/BlackGold2/OilHeritage/OilSprings/tabid/208/Default.aspx | title=Black Gold: Canada's Oil Heritage | publisher=The Corporation of the County of Lambton | accessdate=30 July 2013 | quote=The North American oil industry began in Oil Springs in 1858 in less spectacular fashion. James Miller Williams, a coachmaker from Hamilton, dug into the tar-like gum beds of Enniskillen Township to find their source. At a depth of fourteen feet, he struck oil.

But there is evidence to support Williams, not least of which is that the Drake well did not come into production until August 28, 1859.  The controversial point might be that Williams found oil above bedrock while [[Edwin Drake]]’s well located oil within a bedrock [[oil reservoir|reservoir]]. The discovery at Oil Springs touched off an oil boom which brought hundreds of speculators and workers to the area. Canada's first gusher (flowing well) erupted on January 16, 1862, when local oil man John Shaw struck oil at 158 feet (48 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lclmg.org/lclmg/Museums/OilMuseumofCanada/HamiltonTimesExtraordinaryFlowingOilWell/tabid/355/Default.aspx | title=Extraordinary Flowing Oil Well | work=Hamilton Times | date=20 January 1862 | accessdate=30 July 2013 | pages=2 | quote=Our correspondent writes us from the Oil Springs, under date of the 16th inst., [an] interesting account of a flowing Oil well which has just been tapped.

It will hardly be credited, but nevertheless such is the case, that the present enormous flow of oil cannot be estimated at less than two thousand barrels per day, (twenty-four hours), of pure oil, and the quantity increasing every hour. I saw three men in the course of one hour, fill fifty barrels from the flow of oil, which is running away in every direction; the flat presenting the appearance of a sea of oil. The excitement is intense, and hundreds are rushing from every quarter to see this extraordinary well. Experience oil well diggers from the other side, affirm that this week equals their best flowing wells in Pennsylvania, and they pronounced the oil as being of a superior quality. This flowing well is situation on lot No. 10, Range B, Messrs.

The first modern oil drilling in the United States began in West Virginia and Pennsylvania in the 1850s. [[Edwin Drake]]'s 1859 well near [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]], is typically considered the first true modern oil well, and touched off a major boom.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/1/2007_1_23.shtml John Steele Gordon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420194514/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/1/2007_1_23.shtml |date=2008-04-20 }} "10 Moments That Made American Business," ''American Heritage'', February/March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vassiliou, Marius 2009"&gt;Vassiliou, Marius (2009).

The first successful [[oil tanker]], the ''Zoroaster'', was built in 1878 in Sweden, designed by [[Ludvig Nobel]]. It operated from [[Baku]] to [[Astrakhan]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolf, Robert W. (1976).

Hoover Press. {{ISBN|0-8179-6581-5}}. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of new tanker designs were developed in the 1880s.

In the early 1930s [[Texaco|the Texas Company]] developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In 1937 [[Pure Oil Company]] (now part of [[Chevron Corporation]]) and its partner [[Superior Oil Company]] (now part of [[ExxonMobil Corporation]]) used a fixed platform to develop a field in {{convert|14|ft|m}} of water, one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) offshore of [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana]].

During World War II (1939-1945) - control of oil supply from Baku and Middle East played a huge role in the events of the war and the ultimate victory of the allies. Cutting off the oil supply considerably weakened Japan in the latter part of the war.
After [[World War II]] ended, the countries of the [[Middle East]] took the lead in oil production from the United States. Important developments since World War II include deep-water drilling, the introduction of the [[Drillship]], and the growth of a global shipping network for petroleum relying upon oil tankers and pipelines. In 1949, first offshore oil drilling at Oil Rocks (Neft Dashlari) in the Caspian Sea off Azerbaijan eventually resulted in a city built on pylons. In the 1960s and 1970s, multi-governmental organizations of oil–producing nations [[OPEC]] and [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries|OAPEC]] played a major role in setting petroleum prices and policy. [[Oil spill]]s and their cleanup have become an issue of increasing political, environmental, and economic importance.

With the advent of hydraulic fracturing and other horizontal drilling techniques, shale play has seen an enormous uptick in production. Areas such as the Permian Basin and Eagle-Ford shales are now huge hotbeds of production for the largest oil corporations in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farah|first=Stanley, Rachel|date=2018-07-24|title=Comparison of Two Active Hydrocarbon Production Regions in Texas to Determine Boomtown Growth and Development: A Geospatial Analysis of Active Well Locations and Demographic Changes, 2000-2017|url=https://ecommons.txstate.edu/handle/10877/7386|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midstream===

[[Midstream]] operations are sometimes classified within the downstream sector, but these operations compose a separate and discrete sector of the petroleum industry. Midstream operations and processes include the following:
* '''Gathering:''' The gathering process employs narrow, low-pressure pipelines to connect oil- and gas-producing wells to larger, long-haul pipelines or processing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalgas.org/naturalgas/transport.asp "The Transportation of Natural Gas,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101062510/http://naturalgas.org/naturalgas/transport.asp |date=2011-01-01 }} NaturalGas.org, Retrieved December 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Processing/refining:''' Processing and refining operations turn crude oil and gas into marketable products. In the case of crude oil, these products include [[heating oil]], [[gasoline]] for use in vehicles, [[jet fuel]], and [[diesel oil]].&lt;ref name="petroleumonline.com"&gt;[http://www.petroleumonline.com/content/overview.asp?mod=8 "Refining and Product Specifications Module Overview,"] Petroleum Online, Retrieved December 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petroleum refining processes|Oil refining processes]] include distillation, [[vacuum distillation]], [[catalytic reforming]], [[catalytic cracking]], [[alkylation]], [[isomerization]] and [[hydrotreating]].&lt;ref name="petroleumonline.com"/&gt; [[Natural-gas processing|Natural gas processing]] includes [[Gas compressor|compression]]; [[glycol dehydration]]; [[Amine gas treating|amine treating]]; separating the product into pipeline-quality natural gas and a stream of mixed natural gas liquids; and fractionation, which separates the stream of mixed natural gas liquids into its components. The fractionation process yields [[ethane]], [[propane]], [[butane]], [[isobutane]], and [[natural gasoline]].
* '''Transportation:''' Oil and gas are transported to processing facilities, and from there to end users, by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]], [[Barge|tanker/barge]], [[Trucking industry in the United States|truck]], and [[Rail transport|rail]]. Pipelines are the most economical transportation method and are most suited to movement across longer distances, for example, across continents.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, Cheryl J., [http://www.pipeline101.com/reports/Notes.pdf "How Pipelines Make the Oil Market Work – Their Networks, Operation and Regulation,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228073802/http://www.pipeline101.com/reports/Notes.pdf |date=2013-12-28 }} Allegro Energy Group, December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Tankers and barges are also employed for long-distance, often international transport. Rail and truck can also be used for longer distances but are most cost-effective for shorter routes.
* '''Storage:''' Midstream service providers provide storage facilities at [[Oil depot|terminals]] throughout the oil and gas distribution systems. These facilities are most often located near refining and processing facilities and are connected to pipeline systems to facilitate shipment when product demand must be met. While petroleum products are held in storage tanks, natural gas tends to be stored in underground facilities, such as salt dome caverns and depleted reservoirs.
* '''Technological applications:''' Midstream service providers apply technological solutions to improve efficiency during midstream processes. Technology can be used during compression of fuels to ease flow through pipelines; to better detect [[Leak detection|leaks in pipelines]]; and to automate communications for better pipeline and equipment monitoring.

While some upstream companies carry out certain midstream operations, the midstream sector is dominated by a number of companies that specialize in these services. Midstream companies include:
* [[Aux Sable Liquid Products|Aux Sable]]
* [[Bridger Group]]
* [[DCP Midstream Partners]]
* [[Enbridge Energy Partners]]
* [[Enterprise Products Partners]]
* [[Genesis Energy LP|Genesis Energy]]
* [[Gibson Energy]]
* [[Inergy|Inergy Midstream]]
* [[Kinder Morgan Energy Partners]]
* [[ONEOK|Oneok Partners]]

Though hydraulic fracturing has significantly increased natural gas extraction, there is some belief and evidence to support that consumable water has seen increased in methane contamination due to this gas extraction. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osborn|first=Stephen G.|last2=Vengosh|first2=Avner|last3=Warner|first3=Nathaniel R.|last4=Jackson|first4=Robert B.|date=2011-05-17|title=Methane contamination of drinking water accompanying gas-well drilling and hydraulic fracturing|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/20/8172|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=108|issue=20|pages=8172–8176|doi=10.1073/pnas.1100682108|issn=0027-8424|pmid=21555547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaks from underground tanks and abandoned refineries may also contaminate groundwater in surrounding areas.

=== Air pollution ===
{{See also|Air pollution}}

The industry is the largest industrial source of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a group of chemicals that contribute to the formation of ground-level [[ozone]] ([[smog]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airquality/oilandgas/basic.html&lt;/ref&gt; The combustion of fossil fuels produces [[greenhouse gases]] and other air pollutants as by-products. Pollutants include [[nitrogen oxide]]s, [[sulphur dioxide]], [[volatile organic compound]]s and [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]].

Researchers have discovered that the [[petrochemical]] industry can produce ground-level ozone pollution at higher amounts in winter than in summer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13767.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Climate change ===
{{See also|Global warming|Attribution of recent climate change}}

The [[greenhouse gases]] due to [[fossil fuel]]s drive [[global warming]]. Already in 1959, at a symposium organised by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] for the centennial of the American oil industry, the [[physicist]] [[Edward Teller]] warned then of the danger of global [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=Franta/&gt; Edward Teller explained that carbon dioxide "in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect" and that burning more [[fossil fuels]] could "melt the icecap and submerge New York".&lt;ref name=Franta&gt;Benjamin Franta, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/01/on-its-hundredth-birthday-in-1959-edward-teller-warned-the-oil-industry-about-global-warming "On its 100th birthday in 1959, Edward Teller warned the oil industry about global warming"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 1 January 2018 (page visited on 2 January 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], founded by the [[United Nations]] in 1988, concludes that [[Human impact on the environment|human-sourced]] [[greenhouse gases]] are [[Attribution of recent climate change|responsible]] for most of the [[Instrumental temperature record|observed temperature increase]] since the middle of the twentieth century.

As a result of climate change concerns, many alternative energy enthusiasts have began using other methods of energy such as solar and wind, among others. This recent view has some petroleum enthusiasts skeptic about the true future of the industry. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016|editor-last=Martín|editor-first=Mariano|title=Alternative Energy Sources and Technologies|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-28752-2|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-28752-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future shortages ==

As petroleum is a [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable natural resource]] the industry is faced with an inevitable eventual depletion of the world's oil supply. The BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2007 listed the [[reserves-to-production ratio|reserve/production ratio]] for proven resources worldwide. This study indicated a ratio of proven reserves to production in the Middle East at 79.5 years, Latin America at 41.2 years and North America at 12 years. A misguided interpretation of the ratio has led to many false predictions of imminent world oil shortages since the early years of the oil industry in the 1800s. This has been especially true in the United States, where the ratio of proved reserves-to-production has been between 8 years and 17 years since 1920. Many have mistakenly interpreted the result as the number of years before the [[oil depletion|oil supply is exhausted]]. Such analyses do not take into account future [[Oil reserves#Reserves growth|reserves growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Hubbert peak theory]], which introduced the concept of [[peak oil]], questions the sustainability of oil production. It suggests that after a peak in oil production rates, a period of [[oil depletion]] will ensue. Since virtually all economic sectors rely heavily on petroleum, peak oil could lead to a partial or complete failure of markets.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/study-warns-of-perilous-oil-crisis/?scp=1&amp;sq=peak%20oil&amp;st=cse German Military Braces for Scarcity After ‘Peak Oil’]". ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to market research by IBISWorld, [[biofuel]]s (primarily ethanol, but also biodiesel) will continue to supplement petroleum. However output levels are low, and these fuels will not displace local oil production. More than 90% of the ethanol used in the US is blended with gasoline to produce a 10% ethanol mix, lifting the oxygen content of the fuel.&lt;ref&gt;IBISWorld.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3823">The '''potential density''' of a fluid parcel at [[pressure]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density]] that the parcel would acquire if [[adiabatic process|adiabatically]] brought to a reference pressure &lt;math&gt;P_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, often 1 [[bar (unit)|bar]] (100 [[kilopascal|kPa]]).  Whereas density changes with changing pressure, potential density of a fluid parcel is [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved]] as the pressure experienced by the parcel changes (provided no mixing with other parcels or net heat flux occurs). The concept is used in [[oceanography]] and (to a lesser extent) [[atmospheric science]].  

Potential density is a dynamically important property: for static stability potential density must decrease upward.  If it doesn't, a fluid parcel displaced upward finds itself lighter than its neighbors, and continues to move upward; similarly, a fluid parcel displaced downward would be heavier than its neighbors.  This is true even if the density of the fluid decreases upward.  In stable conditions (potential density decreasing upward) motion along surfaces of constant potential density ([[isopycnal]]s) is energetically favored over flow across these surfaces (diapycnal flow), so most of the motion within a 3-D geophysical fluid takes place along these 2-D surfaces.  

In oceanography, the symbol &lt;math&gt;\rho_\theta&lt;/math&gt; is used to denote ''potential density'', with the reference pressure &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; taken to be the pressure at the ocean surface. The corresponding ''potential density anomaly'' is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\theta = \rho_\theta - 1000 &lt;/math&gt; [[kilogram|kg]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Because the [[compressibility]] of [[seawater]] varies with [[salinity]] and [[temperature]], the reference pressure must chosen to be near the actual pressure to keep the definition of potential density dynamically meaningful.  Reference pressures are often chosen as a whole multiple of 100 bar; for water near a pressure of 400 bar (40 [[megapascal|MPa]]), say, the reference pressure 400 bar would be used, and the potential density anomaly symbol would be written &lt;math&gt;\sigma_4&lt;/math&gt;.
Surfaces of constant potential density (relative to and in the vicinity of a given reference pressure) are used in the analyses of ocean data and to construct models of [[ocean circulation|ocean current]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. [[Neutral density]] surfaces, defined using another variable called [[neutral density]] (&lt;math&gt; \gamma^n &lt;/math&gt;), can be considered the continuous analog of these potential density surfaces.

Potential density adjusts for the effect of [[Compressibility|compression]] in two ways:
*The effect of a parcel's change in volume due to a change in pressure (as pressure increases, volume decreases).
*The effect of the parcel's change in temperature due to adiabatic change in pressure (as pressure increases, temperature increases).

A parcel's density may be calculated from an [[equation of state]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \rho(P,T,S_1,S_2,...) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is temperature, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is pressure, and &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; are other [[Flow tracer|tracer]]s that affect density (e.g. [[salinity]] of [[seawater]]).  The potential density would then be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_\theta = \rho(P_0,\theta,S_1,S_2,...) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[potential temperature]] of the fluid parcel for the same reference pressure &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''PullApart''' is a UK-based, independent packaging [[recycling]] classification system. Applied at the kerbside, it combines [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[consumer]] packaging [[Statistical survey|surveys]] to provide customers with a measurement of the ease with which specific types of packaging may be recycled locally. The process was invented by Michael Butler of [[Dawlish]] in 2005, and is operated for free.

[[Image:Waste hierarchy rect-en.svg|left|thumbnail|290px|The [[waste hierarchy]]]]

==Methodology==
As PullApart is applied to existing [[local authority]]-installed recycling bin [[refuse collection]] systems, its scoring scheme is dependent on individual local authorities’ own packaging disassembly practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=820 |title=Teignbridge refuse collection systems |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=teignbridge.gov.uk |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613210020/http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=820 |archivedate=2011-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sample packaging is disassembled, according to the Local Authority’s process, rearranged and its components graded for ease of recycling. The raw information from this exercise is also made available to the public.

A final, consumer-oriented "PAC" ('''P'''ull'''A'''part '''C'''ode) score is achieved by measuring what proportion of a product's components is recyclable from the kerbside. The PAC score is represented by 13 stages of ‘traffic light’ grading.

{{ambox | textstyle = text-align: justify; | text = A simplified mathematical representation of PullApart's kerbside scoring system.
Determining local recyclability only, by weight:&lt;br /&gt;
A packaging's non-recyclable is divided by its recyclable. If &lt;= 1 then its GOOD; if &gt; 1 its BAD.
The nearer to zero it is, the better, and the greater above 1, the worse.
Please note: Weight is not the only consideration, there are others including volume, therefore the analysis is more complex than the above.}}

==Broader aims==
PullApart’s stated aims are to [[Advocacy groups|encourage]], [[Manufacturing|manufactures]], [[Retailing|retailers]], [[Food production|food]] and [[Agriculture|agricultural]] producers to give greater weight to the ease of disposal and recycling in their [[packaging]] designs. Weighting the consumers point of view equally to that of packaging manufactures, retailers and recyclers, in the handling of domestic waste products for [[kerbside collection]]s. To provide consumers with information enabling product choice ([[ethical consumerism]]), that's easy, local and totally kerbside recyclable. Furnishing an unambiguous tool, that measures the differences between those mentioned above, assisting in the optimisation of products for the goal of near [[Zero waste]].

According to PullApart’s current [[Teignbridge]] (2011) survey of over 2000 products, 2.84% are ideally suited for kerbside recycling and a further 29.32% are good, whilst the rest fail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pullapart.co.uk/ PullApart's Teignbridge survey:] 2011 (constantly updated)&lt;/ref&gt; The sample area, Teignbridge, and therefore Teignbridge District Council, has a current recycling rate of 57% (2008/2009), (by weight).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=10370 Teignbridge District Council's recycling rate:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613210704/http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=10370 |date=2011-06-13 }} 2008/2009 - 57%&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting from their [[Periodical publication|periodical]], “Teignbridge Life” explaining to local people how PullApart works: “The online packaging recycling guide features a free search function which classifies ordinary consumer products, like cereal boxes, with a 'PullApart' rating. The rating breaks the product down into its components, explaining which parts can be recycled in Teignbridge.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=5967 Teignbridge Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827083754/http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=5967 |date=2010-08-27 }} Summer 2009(a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] download)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ambox | textstyle = text-align: justify; | text = A simplified measurement of effectiveness.
From a local consumer's perspective, the combined effectiveness of both packaging and their local kerbside recycling is simply determined by:&lt;br /&gt;
The percentage of easy “green” packaging (taken from PullApart's 2011 survey), divided by the number of kerbside collection bins and bags. For Teignbridge areas A and B, this is (at the time of writing), 32.16% / 4 = 8.04  and for their communal area C its 32.16% / 6 = 5.36 out of a maximum of 100 (totally easy “green” kerbside packaging into just one collection bin or bag).}}

==Awards for the scheme==
PullApart is considered to be of “Environmental Best Practice” by The Green Organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreenorganisation.info/ Green Apple Awards] Green Apple Awards&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other efforts==
{{main | sustainable packaging}}
Worldwide there are broader packaging scoring systems that address the full environmental impact of packaging. Recycling being one factor, other vital considerations include the use of recycled materials in the package, avoidance of toxic substances, minimization of packaging, effects on atmosphere (greenhouse gas, VOC, etc.), use of [[renewable resource]]s, etc.   Efforts involve methodologies such as [[life cycle assessment]] to inventory the all environmental impacts and factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''reusable shopping bag''', sometimes called '''bag-for-life''' in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-30176505|title=Bag-for-life 'bug risk' advice|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34401851|title=How can plastic bag addiction be cured?|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[shopping bag]] which can be reused many times. It is an alternative to single-use paper or plastic bags. It is often made from fabric such as [[canvas]], natural fibres such as [[Jute]], woven synthetic fibers, or a thick [[plastic]] that is more durable than [[disposable]] plastic bags, allowing multiple use.

Reusable shopping bags are a kind of [[carrier bag]], which are available for sale in [[supermarkets]] and apparel shops. Some reusable bags have been found to contain high amounts of lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Studies-find-lead-in-reusable-shopping-bags-2461560.php|title=Studies find lead in reusable shopping bags|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reusable bags require more energy to produce than common plastic shopping bags. one reusable bag requires the same amount of energy as an estimated 28 traditional plastic shopping bags or eight paper bags. "If used once per week, four or five reusable bags will replace 520 plastic bags a year", according to Nick Sterling, research director at Natural Capitalism Solutions.&lt;ref name="energy use"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122238422541876879 | work=Wall Street Journal | title=An Inconvenient Bag | first=Ellen | last=Gamerman | date=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study commissioned by the United Kingdom Environment Agency in 2005 found that the average cotton bag is used only 51 times before being thrown away.&lt;ref name="canvas totes"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/plastic-fantastic-carrier-bags-not-ecovillains-after-all-2220129.html | work=The Independent | title=Plastic fantastic! Carrier bags 'not eco-villains after all' | first=Martin | last=Hickman |date=2011-02-20 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, reusable bags need to be used over 100 times before they are better for the environment than single-use plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Truth about Reusable Shopping Bags|work= MarketWatch|date= February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Use in the United States===

First introduced in the US in 1977, [[plastic shopping bag]]s for bagging groceries at stores flourished in the 1980s and 1990s, replacing paper bags.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In 1990s, governments in some countries started to impose [[tax]]es on distribution of disposable plastic bags or to regulate the use of them. Some supermarkets have encouraged shoppers to stop using disposable plastic bags, by for example offering inexpensive reusable shopping bags or providing information on plastic bags{{'}} environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;Cherrier H., “Consumer identity and moral obligations in non-plastic bag consumption: a dialectical perspective&lt;/ref&gt; The physical shape of reusable shopping bags is often different than was typical before the prevalence of plastic bags. The apparel industry promotes reusable shopping bags as [[sustainable fashion]].

Many [[supermarket]]s  encourage the use of reusable shopping bags to increase sales and profit margins. Most non woven bags cost $0.10-0.25 to produce but are sold for $0.99-$3.00.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  As stores receive diminishing returns due to saturated markets, there are concerns that prices will drop and they will become the new single-use bag.  Some major supermarket chains have string or [[Calico (textile)|calico]] bags available for sale. They are sold with announcement of environmental issues in many cases. The ones sold in supermarkets often have designs related to nature, such as prints of trees or that of the earth, in order to emphasize environmental issues. One startup company out of [[Duluth, Minnesota]], embroiders their bags with their local [[Aerial Lift Bridge]] on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://reducereuseduluth.com|work= Reduce Reuse Duluth|date= April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supermarkets have rewards programs for [[customers]] who bring own shopping bags. When the customers collect a certain amount of points, they can usually get discount coupons or gifts, which motivate customers to reduce plastic bag use. Some retailers such as [[Whole Foods Market]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]] offer a cash discount for bringing in reusable bags.&lt;ref name="cash discount"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2010-01-26-retailfuture26_CV_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Retailers try new survival strategies for 2010 | first=Jayne | last=O'Donnell | date=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cash discount 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteapricot.com/fab_finds/rm_reusable_shopping_bags.php |title=Eco friendly Reusable Shopping Bags |publisher=White Apricot |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999, 6.25 billion reusable bags were imported into the [[United States]] for resale and give-aways under Harmonized Tariff Code (HTC) 4202923031 as reported by the [[United States International Trade Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dataweb.usitc.gov/scripts/query.asp |title=US International Trade Commission Import Database |publisher=Dataweb.usitc.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most U.S. grocery store customers do not bring their own bags, and many reusable bags go unused by customers, according to a 2008 article in the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gamerman |first=Ellen |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122238422541876879 |title=An Inconvenient Bag |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2008-09-26 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Walmart]] Stores proposed turning three [[California]] stores into reusable bag only stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/yourmoney/sns-200910221830mctnewsservbc-cns-walmart-bags-sa4,0,2604105.story |title=Wal-Mart postpones trial removing free plastic bags, Chicago Tribune |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, Walmart was prepared to introduce a $0.15 reusable bag. On 23 October 2009, Walmart abandoned plans to remove carrier bags and introduced the new lower-cost bags.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} In contrast to previous bags sold at $0.99 and $0.50, these lower cost bags may reduce price incentive to reuse these heavier-duty bags.{{original research inline|date=July 2013}}

===Use in the United Kingdom===

Reusable shopping bags are offered in most [[United Kingdom|British]] [[supermarket|supermarkets]]. These are sold for a nominal sum, usually 10 pence, and are replaced for free. The bags are more durable than standard bags, meaning that they can be reused many times over.

The main purpose of this is to ensure that packaging waste legislation was met and to encourage the bags to be recycled (which usually earns the retailer a small amount of money per bag), and unlike with 5p [[carrier bag]]s there is a (small) financial incentive to bring the bags back for recycling, lessening the environmental impact.

In contrast to most spartan carrier bags, bags for life tend to be colourful and sometimes show some aspect of the supermarket's advertising. Some supermarkets maintain the same design for years at a time, whereas some, like [[Waitrose]], rotate the designs to tie in with either the season or the most recent advertising campaign.

Waitrose was the first British Supermarket to launch Bag For Life in association with British Polythene Industries. It was the brainchild of Gini Ekstein, from British Polythene industries. Gini Ekstein with Paul Oustedal and Nick Jones, of Waitrose, launched Bag For Life in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/YourRubbish/asp/06/Food.aspx |title=Norfolk News, Norfolk Sport, Norfolk Business News, Norfolk Jobs, Norfolk Cars, Norfolk Houses - EDP24 |publisher=New.edp24.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106140944/http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/YourRubbish/asp/06/Food.aspx |archivedate=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first closed-loop recycling initiative; returned and broken bags are made into black benches places outside Waitrose stores. The initial marketing messages designed by Gini Ekstein, British Polythene Industries and Beth Chiles, of Message Marketing, are still in use today. As of April 2008, [[Marks and Spencer]] are giving their "bags for life" free to every customer, as their normal plastic bags will have to be paid for from May 6. This will be a small sum of 5 pence a carrier. The bags are given to the customer every time they shop, so they will have plenty when the switchover in May comes live.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Later on, Sainsbury's and other supermarkets introduced the ''bag for life''. As of 2016, the UK Government introduced a tax on all carrier bags, which means that every consumer pays 5p for any carrier bag from any store.

Reusable plastic bags do however have a very simple end of life disposal route. Most reusable plastic carrier bags are made from LDPE 4 (Low Density Poly-Ethylene) which is the easiest form of plastic to recycle currently in the UK (August 2018). These types of plastic carrier bag (along with 'single use' plastic carrier bags) can be recycled with many local council kerbside collections in the UK. 

The increasing use of [[jute]] and juco bags (a mix of cotton and jute) has provided a natural alternative to single-use plastic bags and reusable plastic bags. These are found in many of the major supermarkets, and over 50 million have been sold in the UK alone.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} These bags have a 3-4 year lifespan and so are often seen as the ecological option. 
Jute bags have become a crossover product from an alternative to plastics to a fashion/shopper accessory. Jute bags will last for about 4 years – if used correctly will replace over 600 single bags. At end of life, they can be used as planters for growing garden vegetables.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Use in Ireland===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
In Ireland, they were introduced in March 2002, when the [[Taxation in the Republic of Ireland#Plastic bag levy|Plastic Bag Environmental Levy]] was brought in to reduce the massive amount of disposable bags being used annually. Bags costing 70 euro cents or more are exempt from the levy.

===Use in Australia and New Zealand===

[[Image:GreenBag.jpg|thumb|A "green bag" from Australia]]
Introduced in the 90s, these bags are known as '''green bags''' in [[Australia]] due to their relative environmental friendliness and usual (though far from universal) green color. Green Bags and similar reusable shopping bags are commonly distributed at the point of sale by supermarkets and other retail outlets.  They are intended to be reused repeatedly to replace the use of hundreds of [[High-density polyethylene]] (HDPE) plastic bags. Most green bags are made of 100% [[Non-woven]] [[Polypropylene]] (NWPP)&lt;ref name="green bag OZ"&gt;{{cite web| title=FAQ| url=http://www.greenpac.com.au/FAQ.htm|publisher=greenpac.com.au| accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which is [[recyclable]] but not biodegradable. Some companies claim to be making NWPP bags from recycled material, however with current manufacturing techniques this is not possible. All NWPP bags are made from virgin material.{{cn|date=September 2017}} Similar bags are made of [[jute]], [[canvas]], [[Calico (textile)|calico]] or [[hemp]] but are not discussed here. A typical base insert is 200 mm × 300 mm and weighs 30 g. It is generally made of a stiff plastic.

==Food safety==
Most reusable bag shoppers do not wash their bags once they return home, and the bags may be leading to [[food poisoning]], according to [[Richard Summerbell|Dr. Richard Summerbell]], research director at Toronto-based Sporometrics and former chief of medical mycology for the [[Ontario]] Ministry of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/theappetizer/archive/2009/05/20/back-to-plastic-reusable-grocery-bags-may-pose-public-health-risk.aspx |title=Back to plastic? Reusable grocery bags may cause food poisoning - The Appetizer |publisher=Network.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of their repeated exposure to raw meats and vegetables, there is an increased risk of [[foodborne illness]].  A 2008 study of bags, sponsored by the Environmental and Plastics Industry Council of Canada, found mold and bacterial levels in one reusable bag to be 300% greater than the levels that would be considered safe in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20081127/reusable_bags_081127/20081127?hub=TorontoHome |title=CTV Toronto - Reusable bags contain bacteria, mould: study - CTV News, Shows and Sports - Canadian Television |publisher=Toronto.ctv.ca |date=2008-11-27 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plastics.ca/_files/file.php?fileid=0&amp;filename=file_A_Microbiological_Study_of_Reusable_Grocery_Bags_May20_09.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - A Microbiological Study of Reusable Plastic Grocery Bags - Rpt &amp; Cover Note-May 19-09.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The study does not differentiate between non-hemp bags and hemp bags, which have natural antimildew and antimicrobial properties.&lt;ref name="hemp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naihc.org/hemp_information/hemp_defined.html |title=Hemp Defined |publisher=Naihc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 joint University of Arizona and Limo Loma University study (sponsored by the American Chemistry Council, a trade group that advocates on behalf of disposable plastic bag manufacturers) they found that "Reusable grocery bags can be a breeding ground for dangerous foodborne bacteria and pose a serious risk to public health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uanews.org/node/32521 |title=Reusable Grocery Bags Contaminated With E. Coli, Other Bacteria |publisher=UANews.org |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study found that 97% of users did not wash them and that greater than 50% of the 84 bags contained coliform (a bacterium found in fecal material), while ''E. coli'' was found in 12% of the bags.&lt;ref&gt;http://uanews.org/pdfs/GerbaWilliamsSinclair_BagContamination.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The study made the following recommendations:
#States should consider requiring printed instructions on reusable bags indicating they need to cleaned or bleached between uses.
#State and local governments should invest in a public education campaign to alert the public about risk and prevention.
#When using reusable bags, consumers should be careful to separate raw foods from other food products.
#Consumers should not use reusable food bags for other purposes such as carrying books or gym clothes.
#Consumers should not store meat or produce in the trunks of their cars because the higher temperature promotes growth of bacteria, which can contaminate reusable bags.

The study further showed that machine or hand washing even without the presence of bleach was effective in reducing coliform and other bacteria in the bags to levels below detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerba, Charles P.  |author2=Williams, David |author3=Sinclair, Ryan  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Assessment of the Potential for Cross Contamination of Food Products by Reusable Shopping Bags |date=June 9, 2010}}	&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' article criticized the 2010 study, calling into question the small sample size of bags examined in the study and the questionable danger of the type and amount of bacteria found.  Michael Hansen, senior staff scientist at Consumers Union, stated "A person eating an average bag of salad greens gets more exposure to these bacteria than if they had licked the insides of the dirtiest bag from this study". But Hansen notes that there are some reminders to take away from the study. It’s easy to spread bacteria from meat, fish, or poultry to other foods – in your kitchen or in your grocery bags. So he does think it’s wise to carry those items in disposable bags. Reusable bags are fine for most everything else, but it’s a good idea to wash them occasionally.&lt;ref name="news.consumerreports"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.consumerreports.org/safety/2010/07/can-reusable-grocery-bags-make-you-sick-or-is-that-just-baloney.html |title=Can reusable grocery bags make you sick, or is that just baloney? |publisher=ConsumerReports.org |date=2010-07-22 |accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product safety==
In September 2010, "Wegmans Food Markets Inc., owner of a chain of East Coast supermarkets, announced it would replace reusable shopping bags after a consumer group found the sacks had high levels of lead." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plungis |first=Jeff |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-10/wegmans-markets-replaces-reusable-bags-after-group-cites-high-lead-levels.html |title=Wegmans Markets Replaces Reusable Bags After Group Cites High Lead Levels |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2010-09-10 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg News also stated that the high levels were related to two specific designs, totaling more than 725,000 bags.

After a report in the ''[[Tampa Tribune]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/nov/14/140842/lead-taints-reusable-bags/news-metro/ |title=Refunds offered on reusable grocery bags containing lead |publisher=.tbo.com |date=2010-11-14 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in November 2010 that elevated levels of lead were found in similar reusable bags, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] opened an investigation responding to calls by U.S. environmental and consumer groups, as well as U.S. Senator [[Charles Schumer]], to investigate the reusable bags commonly distributed by grocery stores and large retail chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/nov/16/170607/fda-opens-investigation-reusable-grocery-bags/life-health/ |work=tbo.com|title=FDA opens investigation into reusable grocery bags|date=November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winn-Dixie]] recalled their bags after they were directly cited in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Armour |first=Stephanie |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/environment/2010-11-15-toxicbags15_st_N.htm |title=Lead in reusable grocery bags prompts call for federal inquiry |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2010-11-19 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Canadian-based athletic retailer [[Lululemon Athletica]] recalled complimentary reusable bags distributed since November 2009 because "environmental concerns were raised over the proper disposal of reusable bags due to lead content." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/sports/Lululemon+recalls+reusable+shopping+bags/4010985/story.html |title=Lululemon recalls reusable shopping bags|work=Edmonton Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sears]]' Canadian stores announced a recall on reusable bags because of similar findings on January 6, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/health/Sears+recalled+over+high+lead+content/4067021/story.html |title=Sears bag recalled over high lead content |publisher=Ottawacitizen.com |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 12, 2011, The Center for Environmental Health announced Disney-themed bags from U.S. grocery chain Safeway have been found to contain levels of lead 15 to 17 times the current federal limit of 300ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2011/jan/12/121657/lead-found-in-disney-licensed-shopping-bags/news-breaking/ |title=Lead found in Disney-licensed shopping bags |publisher=tbo.com |date=2011-01-12 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safeway recalled bags that had been identified as containing high levels of lead in late January 2011.

In January 2011, ''[[USA Today]]'' ran an article based on a report from the [[Center for Consumer Freedom]], a front group for the "hospitality industries", that bags sold in the U.S. by [[Bloom (store)|Bloom]], [[Giant-Carlisle|Giant]], [[Giant Eagle]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], [[Walgreens]], and other grocery chains and retailers contained levels of lead in excess of 100 parts per million, the maximum amount allowed under law in many U.S. states. They have not produced their testing methods and data, and many organizations feel this was an attempt to discredit the use of reusable bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/is_the_plastic_industry_the_new_tobacco_industry |title=Is the Plastic Industry the New Tobacco Industry? |publisher=Earth Island Journal |author=Amy Westervelt |date=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom stopped distributing the bags due to toxicity levels prior to the study, but did not recall the bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Donnell |first=Jayne |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2011-01-23-reusable-bags_N.htm |title=Tests find high levels of lead in reusable bags |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2011-01-27 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other concerns have been raised about the safety of reusable bags due to infrequent washing and the presence of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/24/AR2010062406143.html|title=Reusable grocery bags found to be full of bacteria|work=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Oregon Public Health published a study in the ''[[Journal of Infectious Diseases]]'', traced an outbreak of the dangerous [[norovirus]] to a reusable grocery bag that members of a Beaverton girls' soccer team passed around when they shared cookies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/205/11/1639.full|title=A Point-Source Norovirus Outbreak Caused by Exposure to Fomites|author=Kimberly K.

==Legislation and reusable bags==
{{main article|Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags}}
Some governments have encouraged or required the use of reusable shopping bags through the regulation of plastic bags with bans, recycling mandates, taxes or fees.&lt;ref&gt;“China bans free plastic shopping bags”, International Herald Tribune, January 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation to discourage plastic bag use has been passed in parts of [[Hong Kong]], [[Ireland]], [[South Africa]], the United States, Canada, and [[Taiwan]].

In 2002, the Australian federal government studied the use of throwaway plastic bags and threatened to outlaw them if retailers did not voluntarily discourage their use. In 2003, the government negotiated with the Australian Retailers Association a voluntary progressive reduction of plastic bag use which led to a number of initiatives, including the widespread distribution and promotion of Green Bags.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

From 1 October 2011, the Welsh government began enforcing a minimum tax of 5p on single use carrier bags.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 2012, [[San Luis Obispo County, CA]] outlawed disposable plastic bags and began requiring shoppers to bring their own bags or pay a 10 cent per bag fee for paper bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=SanLuisObispo.com|date=September 29, 2012|url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2012/09/29/2245711/plastic-bag-ban-starts-monday.html|title=Plastic Bag Ban Starts Monday}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[District of Columbia|District of Columbia began requiring a 5¢]] fee for each disposable bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anacostia River Clean Up and Protection Act of 2009 {{!}} ddoe|url = http://doee.dc.gov/publication/anacostia-river-clean-and-protection-act-2009|website = doee.dc.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Portland, Oregon]] began mandated programs to eliminate disposable checkout bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Frequently-asked Questions about Portland's Plastic Bag Ban {{!}} Bring Your Bag! {{!}} The City of Portland, Oregon|url = https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/article/402484|website = www.portlandoregon.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Canadian province of Quebec voted in a program to ban disposable bags, but the program must be adopted by each municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Some types of plastic bags could soon be banned in Montreal|url = https://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/montreal-plastic-bag-ban|website = Montreal Gazette|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Montreal bans single-use plastic bags as of 2018|url = http://phys.org/news/2015-12-montreal-single-use-plastic-bags.html|website = phys.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toronto had tried a similar program, but was eliminated after a short time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Plastic Bag Ban {{!}} Toronto Environmental Alliance|url = http://www.torontoenvironment.org/campaigns/waste/bagbanfaq|website = www.torontoenvironment.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion trend==
Because of the encouragement of reusable shopping bags by governments and supermarkets, reusable shopping bags have become one of the new fashion trends. The apparel industry also contributed to making it popular to have fashionable reusable shopping bags instead of disposable plastic bags.  In 2007, British designer [[Anya Hindmarch]]'s $15 "I'm Not A Plastic Bag" (an unbleached [[cotton]] bag) sold out in one day, and fetched $800 on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bonisteel |first=Sara |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,284395,00.html |title=Behold the $800 Reusable Grocery Bag - Business And Money &amp;#124; Business News &amp;#124; Financial News |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand Envirosax started out producing reusable shopping bags, but have expanded their lines with more color and pattern options, in addition to licensing properties like [[Sesame Street]].

Environmental concerns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediendenk.de/index.php?AID=0000028350 Mediendenk (21 December 2013). ''Umweltaktion von Bürgerblick Passau: Netz gegen Plastikmüll''] (in German) (Accessed: 4 December 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ostalgie]] (nostalgia for East Germany), and a general fashion for [[retro]] style have led to the resurgence, in all parts of Germany, of what was once considered the frumpy ''Omas Einkaufsnetz'' (Grandma's [[String bag|shopping net]]).&lt;ref name=Tagesspiegel&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/geschichte/aus-der-mode-aus-dem-sinn/1501512.html Wiebrecht V., Skuppin, R. (2005) in Tagesspiegel. ''Aus der Mode, aus dem Sinn Das Einkaufsnetz''] (in German). (Accessed: 4 December 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Berlinmorgen&gt;Keseling, Uta (2010). ''Der Stoff, aus dem die DDR war, kehrt zurück'' in Berliner Morgenpost (in German).(Accessed: 4 December 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[DDR Museum]] in Berlin has a collection of ''Einskaufsnetz'', and the bags are now often sold as ''DDR kult Klassiker'' (East German cult classics).&lt;ref name=DDRMuseum&gt;[http://www.ddr-museum.de/de/blog/sammlungen/bdquodederon-ein-begriff-fuer-qualitaetldquo---eine-ddr-kunstfaser-setzt-sich-durch DDR Museum. ''„Dederon, ein Begriff für Qualität“ - Eine DDR-Kunstfaser setzt sich durch''] (in German). (Accessed: 4 December 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlinmorgen" /&gt;

In terms of consumer behaviour, use of reusable bags is positively correlated with organic purchases and with self-indulgent purchases such as ice cream or cookies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karmarkar|first=Uma|title=BYOB: How Bringing your Own Shopping Bags Leads to Treating Yourself, and the Environment|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/14-065_a44e93a2-3a28-4768-ac18-6e0925699d3f.pdf|publisher=[[Harvard Business School]]|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2014}}

'''Ricinoleic acid''', formally called 12-hydroxy-9-''cis''-octadecenoic acid is a [[fatty acid]].  It is an [[saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] [[omega-9 fatty acid|omega-9]] fatty acid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=INZa6WmqDA8C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=Ricinoleic+acid+2-hydroxy-9-cis-octadecenoic+acid&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=St1y1h6DA6&amp;sig=6a-6uPlCMtinsmLnQrOthnWTnSY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSPPU-C9D8-6uASN8oDwBA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ricinoleic%20acid%202-hydroxy-9-cis-octadecenoic%20acid&amp;f=false | title=The Lipid Handbook | publisher=CRC Press |author1=Frank D. Gunstone |author2=John L. Harwood |author3=Albert J. Dijkstra | year=2007 | location=10 | pages=1472 | isbn=1420009672}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[hydroxy acid]]. It is a major component of the seed oil obtained from mature [[Castor plant]] (''Ricinus communis'' L., [[Euphorbiaceae]]) seeds or in sclerotium of [[ergot]] (''Claviceps purpurea'' Tul., [[Clavicipitaceae]]). About 90% of the fatty acid content in [[castor oil]] is the [[triglyceride]] formed from ricinoleic acid.

==Production==
Ricinoleic acid is manufactured for industries by [[saponification]] or [[fractional distillation]] of [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] castor oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=James AT, Hadaway HC, Webb JP |title=The biosynthesis of ricinoleic acid |journal=Biochem. J. |volume=95 |issue= |pages=448–52 |date=May 1965 |pmid=14340094 |pmc=1214342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[zinc ricinoleate|zinc salt]] is used in personal care products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Environmental Working Group]] | url = http://www.ewg.org/chemindex/chemicals/24874 | title = zinc ricinoleate}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[deodorant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomsofmaine.com/toms/ifs/zinc_ricinoleate.asp Tom's of Maine - About Our Products&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempts to prepare ricinoleic acid were made by [[Friedrich Krafft]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title={{fixcaps|THE PURIFICATION OF SODIUM RICINOLEATE}}|first=T.H.|last=Rider|journal=[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]| date=November 1931 |volume=53|pages=4130–4133|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01362a031|doi=10.1021/ja01362a031|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological activities==
Ricinoleic acid exerts [[analgesic]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vieira C, Evangelista S, Cirillo R, Lippi A, Maggi CA, Manzini S |title=Effect of ricinoleic acid in acute and subchronic experimental models of inflammation |journal=Mediators Inflamm. |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=223–8 |year=2000 |pmid=11200362 |pmc=1781768 |doi=10.1080/09629350020025737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricinoleic acid specifically activates the [[Prostaglandin E receptor 3|EP3 prostanoid receptor]] for [[prostaglandin E2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tunaru S, Althoff TF, Nüsing RM, Diener M, Offermanns S |title=Castor oil induces laxation and uterus contraction via ricinoleic acid activating prostaglandin EP3 receptors |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=109 |issue=23 |pages=9179–9184 |year=2012 |pmid=22615395 |pmc=3384204 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1201627109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricinoleic acid acts as a specific algicide for the control of cyanobacteria (formerly called blue-green algae).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |vauthors=van Aller RT, Pessoney GF |title=Selective algaecides for control of cyanochloronta |country=US | number = 4398937 |pubdate=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other fields predating this use, it can refer to any process of applying coatings, [[Roll-to-roll printing|printing]], or performing other processes starting with a roll of a flexible material and re-reeling after the process to create an output roll. These processes, and others such as sheeting, can be grouped together under the general term '''[[converting]]'''. When the rolls of material have been coated, laminated or printed they can be subsequently slit to their finished size on a [[slitter]] rewinder.

== In electronic devices ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13596">'''Sedimentation potential''' occurs when [[dispersed particles]] move under the influence of either [[gravity]] or [[centrifugation]] in a medium. This motion disrupts the equilibrium symmetry of the particle's [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. While the particle moves, the ions in the electric double layer lag behind due to the liquid flow. This causes a slight displacement between the [[surface charge]] and the [[electric charge]] of the [[diffuse layer]]. As a result, the moving particle creates a [[electric dipole moment|dipole moment]]. The sum of all of the dipoles generates an electric field which is called ''sedimentation potential''. It can be measured with an open electrical circuit, which is also called '''sedimentation current'''.

There are detailed descriptions of this effect in many books on [[interface and colloid science|colloid and interface science]].&lt;ref name="lyklema"&gt;Lyklema, J.

==Surface energy==

=== Background related to phenomenon ===

[[File:Sedimentation Potential 1n.jpg|thumb|right|Sedimentation potential]]

[[Electrokinetic phenomena]] are a family of several different effects that occur in heterogeneous fluids or in porous bodies filled with fluid. The sum of these phenomena deals with the effect on a particle from some outside resulting in a net electrokinetic effect.

The  common source of all these effects stems from the interfacial 'double layer' of charges. Particles influenced by an external force generate tangential motion of a fluid with respect to an adjacent charged surface. This force may consist of electric, pressure gradient, concentration gradient, gravity. In addition, the moving phase might be either the continuous fluid or dispersed phase.

Sedimentation potential is the field of electrokinetic phenomena dealing with the generation of an electric field by sedimenting colloid particles.

=== History of models ===
This phenomenon was first discovered by Dorn in 1879. He observed that a vertical electric field had developed in a suspension of glass beads in water, as the beads were settling. This was the origin of sedimentation potential, which is often referred to as the Dorn effect.

Smoluchowski built the first models to calculate the potential in the early 1900s. Booth created a general theory on sedimentation potential in 1954 based on Overbeek's 1943 theory on electrophoresis. In 1980, Stigter extended Booth's model to allow for higher surface potentials. Ohshima created a model based on O'Brien and White 's 1978 model used to analyze the sedimentation velocity of a single charged sphere and the sedimentation potential of a dilute suspension.

===Generation of a potential ===

As a charged particle moves through a gravitational force or centrifugation, an [[electric potential]] is induced. While the particle moves, ions in the electric double layer lag behind creating a net dipole moment behind due to liquid flow. The sum of all dipoles on the particle is what causes sedimentation potential. Sedimentation potential has the opposite effect compared to [[electrophoresis]] where an electric field is applied to the system. Ionic conductivity is often referred to when dealing with sedimentation potential.

         [[File:Macroscopic Diagram of Sedementation.jpg|thumb|Macroscopic Diagram of Sedementation]]

The following relation provides a measure of the sedimentation potential due to the settling of charged spheres. First discovered by  Smoluchowski in 1903 and 1921. This relationship only holds true for non-overlapping electric double layers and for dilute suspensions. In 1954, Booth proved that this idea held true for Pyrex glass powder settling in a KCl solution. From this relation, the sedimentation potential, E&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, is independent of the particle radius and that  E&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; → 0, Φ &lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; → 0 (a single particle).

                          &lt;math&gt;E_{s} = - \frac{\varepsilon\zeta (\rho -\rho _{0})\phi _{p}g }{\sigma ^{\infty }\eta }&lt;/math&gt;

                                   
Smoluchowski's sedimentation potential is defined where ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the permitivity of free space, D the dimensionless dielectric constant, ξ the zeta potential, g the acceleration due to gravity, Φ the particle volume fraction, ρ the particle density, ρ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; the medium density, λ the specific volume conductivity, and η the viscosity.&lt;ref name=marlow /&gt;

Smoluchowski developed the equation under five assumptions:
# Particles are spherical, nonconducting, and monodispersed.
# Laminar flow around the particles occurs (Reynolds number &lt;1).
# Interparticle interactions are negligible.
# Surface conduction is negligible.
# The double-layer thickness 1/κ is small compared to the particle radius a (κa&gt;&gt;1).&lt;ref name=marlow&gt;B. J. Marlow, and R. L. Rowell. "Sedimentation Potential in Aqueous Electrolytes." ''Langmuir'' 1985, 1, 83-90&lt;/ref&gt;

                                &lt;math&gt;\sigma ^{\infty} = \frac{e^{2}}{k_{B}T}\sum z_{i}^{2}D_{i}n_{i\infty }&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the diffusion coefficient of the ''ith'' solute species, and ''n&lt;sub&gt;i∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number concentration of electrolyte solution.
An improved design cell was developed to determine sedimentation potential, specific conductivity, volume fraction of the solids as well as pH. Two pairs of electrodes are used in this set up, one to measure potential difference and the other for resistance. A flip switch is utilized to avoid polarization of the resistance electrodes and buildup of charge by alternating the current. The pH of the system could be monitored and the electrolyte was drawn into the tube using a vacuum pump.&lt;ref name=Uddin&gt;Uddin, S.; Mirnezami, M., and Finch, J.A. "Surface Characterization of Single and Mixed Mineral Systems using Sedimentation Potential." ''The Minerals, Metals, and Materials Society'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Induced Dipole Caused by Sedementation1.jpg|thumb|Sedimentation Of A Single Particle Generates a Potential]]Ohshima's model was developed in 1984 and was originally used to analyze the sedimentation velocity of a single charged sphere and the sedimentation potential of a dilute suspension. The model provided below holds true for dilute suspensions of low zeta potential, ''i.e. e''ζ/κ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T ≤2
                            &lt;math&gt; E_{s} = - \frac{\varepsilon\zeta (\rho -\rho _{0})\phi _{p} }{\sigma ^{\infty }\eta } gH(\kappa \alpha )+\vartheta(\zeta ^2)&lt;/math&gt;

==Testing==

=== Measurement ===
[[File:Rotational method for measurement of sedimentation potential.png|thumb|Instrumental Setup to measure Sedimentation Potential]]
Sedimentation potential is measured by attaching [[electrodes]] to a glass column filled with the dispersion of interest. A [[voltmeter]] is attached to measure the potential generated from the suspension. To account for different geometries of the electrode, the column is typically rotated 180 degrees while measuring the potential. This difference in potential through rotation by 180 degrees is twice the sedimentation potential. The [[zeta potential]] can be determined through measurement by sedimentation potential, as the concentration, conductivity of the suspension, density of the particle, and potential difference are known. By rotating the column 180 degrees, drift and geometry differences of the column can be ignored.&lt;ref name=ozaki&gt;Masataka Ozaki, Tomoyuki Ando, and Kenji Mizuno. "A new method for the measurement of sedimentation potential: rotating column method." ''Colloids and Surfaces'' 1999, 159, 477-480&lt;/ref&gt;

                              &lt;math&gt;\zeta = \frac{\eta \lambda E_{s}}{\varepsilon_{r}\varepsilon _{0}(\rho -\rho _{0})g }&lt;/math&gt;

When dealing with the case of concentrated systems, the zeta potential can be determined through measurement of the sedimentation potential &lt;math&gt;E_{s}&lt;/math&gt;, from the potential difference relative to the distance between the electrodes. The other parameters represent the following: &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; the viscosity of the medium; &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; the bulk conductivity; &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{r}&lt;/math&gt; the [[relative permittivity]] of the medium; &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{0}&lt;/math&gt; the [[permittivity]] of free space; &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; the density of the particle; &lt;math&gt;\rho_{0}&lt;/math&gt; the density of the medium; &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration due to gravity; and σ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; is the electrical conductivity of the bulk electrolyte solution.&lt;ref name=ozaki /&gt;

An improved design cell was developed to determine sedimentation potential, specific conductivity, volume fraction of the solids as well as pH. Two pairs of electrodes are used in this set up, one to measure potential difference and the other for resistance. A flip switch is utilized to avoid polarization of the resistance electrodes and buildup of charge by alternating the current. The pH of the system could be monitored and the electrolyte was drawn into the tube using a vacuum pump.&lt;ref name="Uddin"/&gt;

== Applications==

===Applications of sedimentation field flow fractionation (SFFF)===
Sedimentation field flow fractionation (SFFF) is a non-destructive separation technique which can be used for both separation, and collecting fractions. Some applications of SFFF include characterization of particle size of latex materials for adhesives, coatings and paints, colloidal silica for binders, coatings and compounding agents, titanium oxide pigments for paints, paper and textiles, emulsion for soft drinks, and biological materials like viruses and liposomes.&lt;ref name=merkus&gt;Merkus, H.G.; Mori, Y.; Scarlett B. "Particle size analysis by sedimentation field flow fractional, Performance and application" ''Colloid and Polymer Science'' 1989, 267, 1102-1107&lt;/ref&gt;

Some main aspects of SFFF include: it provides high-resolution possibilities for size distribution measurements with high precision, the resolution is dependent on experimental conditions, the typical analysis time is 1 to 2 hours, and it is a non-destructive technique which offers the possibility of collecting fraction.&lt;ref name=merkus /&gt;

===Particle size analysis by sedimentation field flow fractionation===
As sedimentation field flow fractionation (SFFF) is one of field flow fractionation separation techniques, it is appropriate for fractionation and characterization of particulate materials and soluble samples in the colloid size range. Differences in interaction between a centrifugal force field and particles with different masses or sizes lead to the separation. An exponential distribution of particles of a certain size or weight is results due to the Brownian motion. Some of the assumptions to develop the theoretical equations include that there is no interaction between individual particles and equilibrium can occur anywhere in separation channels.&lt;ref name=merkus /&gt;

{{crystallization}}
A '''seed crystal''' is a small piece of [[single crystal]] or [[polycrystal]] material from which a large [[crystal]] of typically the same material is to be grown in a laboratory. Used to replicate material, the use of seed crystal to promote growth avoids the otherwise slow randomness of natural crystal growth and allows manufacture on a scale suitable for industry. 

==Process==
The large crystal can be [[Crystal growth|grown]] by dipping the seed into a [[supersaturated solution]], into molten material that is then cooled, or by growth on the seed face by passing vapor of the material to be grown over it.

==Theory==
The theory behind this effect is thought to derive from the physical intermolecular interaction that occurs between compounds in a supersaturated [[solution]] (or possibly vapor). In solution, liberated (soluble) molecules ([[solution|solute]]) are free to move about in random flow. This random flow permits for the possibility of two or more molecular compounds to interact. This interaction can potentiate intermolecular forces between the separate molecules and form a basis for a [[crystal lattice]]. The placement of a seed crystal into solution allows the [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] process to expedite by eliminating the need for random molecular collision or interaction. By introducing an already pre-formed basis of the target crystal to act upon, the intermolecular interactions are formed much more easily or readily, than relying on random flow. Often, this phase transition from solute in a [[solution]] to a [[crystal lattice]] will be referred to as [[nucleation]]. Seeding is therefore said to decrease the necessary amount of time needed for nucleation to occur in a recrystallization process.

==Uses==
One example where a seed crystal is used to grow large [[boule (crystal)|boules]] or [[ingot]]s of a single crystal is the [[semiconductor]] industry where methods such as the [[Czochralski process]] or [[Bridgman technique]] are employed.

&lt;br /&gt;
'''Self-discharge''' is a phenomenon in [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] in which internal chemical reactions reduce the stored charge of the battery without any connection between the electrodes. Self-discharge decreases the [[shelf life]] of batteries and causes them to initially have less than a full charge when actually put to use.

How fast self-discharge in a battery occurs is dependent on the type of battery, state of charge, charging current, ambient temperature and other factors. [[Primary cell|Primary batteries]], which aren't designed for recharging between manufacturing and use, use battery chemistry with much lower self-discharge rates than rechargeable batteries, since they must have an economically practical shelf life.

Self-discharge is a chemical reaction, just as closed-circuit discharge is, and tends to occur more quickly at higher temperatures. Storing batteries at lower temperatures thus reduces the rate of self-discharge and preserves the initial energy stored in the battery. Self-discharge is also thought to be reduced as a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]] develops on the electrodes over time.

[[File:AFM-TOC-v1.0-wiki.tif|thumb|Schematic of the Solar Transistor or Solaristor]]

A '''solaristor''' (from [[Solar cell|SOLAR cell]] [[Transistor|transISTOR]]) is a compact two terminal self-powered [[phototransistor]]. The two-in-one transistor plus solar cell achieves the high-low current modulation by a [[Memristor|memresistive]] effect in the flow of photogenerated carriers. The term was coined by Dr Amador Perez-Tomas working in collaboration with other [[Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2)|ICN2]] researchers in 2018 when they demonstrated the concept in a [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]]-oxide/[[Organic solar cell|organic bulk heterojunction]] solar cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pérez-Tomás|first=Amador|last2=Lima|first2=Anderson|last3=Billon|first3=Quentin|last4=Shirley|first4=Ian|last5=Catalan|first5=Gustau|last6=Lira-Cantú|first6=Mónica|title=A Solar Transistor and Photoferroelectric Memory|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adfm.201707099|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|language=en|doi=10.1002/adfm.201707099|issn=1616-3028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of operation==
In a basic Solaristor embodiment, the self-powered transistor effect is achieved by the integration of a light absorber layer (a material that absorbs [[photon energy]]) in series with a functional [[semiconductor]] transport layer, which internal conductivity or contact resistance can be modified externally. 

===The Light Absorber (The Solar Cell element)===
In general, the light absorber is a semiconductor [[p-n junction]] that:
* [[Shockley–Queisser limit|Efficiently]] harvests photons at different visible wavelengths by the [[photoelectric effect]]. 
* Splits photo-generated excitons into free electron and holes. 
* Bring these free electrons and holes towards their respective outer electrodes by means of an internal field.

Additionally, in [[Thin-film solar cell|thin-film solar cells]], buffer electron and hole semiconductor transport layers are introduced at the respective metal electrodes to avoid electron-hole recombination and to remove the metal/absorber [[Schottky barrier]].

===The Conductivity Modulation (The Transistor element)===
A Solaristor effect is achieved by modifying the internal field properties or the overall conductivity of the solar cell. 
 
'''Ferroelectric Solaristors'''. One possibility is the use of [[Ferroelectric capacitor|ferroelectric]] semiconductors as transport layers. A ferroelectric layer can be seen as a semiconductor with switchable surface charge polarity. Because of this tuneable dipole effect, ferroelectrics bend their electronic [[Band structure|band structure]] and offsets with respect to adjacent metals and/or semiconductors when switching the ferroelectric polarization so that the overall conductivity can be tuned orders of magnitude.

==Two Terminal Phototransistors==
Conventional [[photodiodes]] or [[photodetectors]] do not switch as a [[Phototransistor|phototransistor]] does when biased through its third terminal (gate). An additional advantage of a Solaristor is, therefore, the potential reduction of the standard phototransistor’s area and interconnection complexity. By using Solaristors, it would be possible in theory to replace the in-plane three-electrode architecture by a vertical, two-electrode photodiode-like architecture in systems like photo-sensors, cameras or displays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31876">'''Ultra-low-sulfur diesel''' ('''ULSD''') is [[diesel fuel]] with substantially lowered [[sulfur]] content. Since 2006, almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in Europe and North America has been of a ULSD type.

The move to lower sulfur content allows for the application of advanced [[Vehicle emissions control|emissions control technologies]] that substantially lower the [[Diesel exhaust|harmful emissions]] from diesel combustion.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Omidvarborna|title=Characterization of particulate matter emitted from transit buses fueled with B20 in idle modes|journal=Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering|volume=2|issue=4|pages=2335–2342|doi=10.1016/j.jece.2014.09.020|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213343714002140|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing by engine manufacturers and regulatory bodies have found the use of emissions control devices in conjunction with ULSD can reduce the exhaust output of [[ozone]] precursors and [[particulate matter]] to near-zero levels.&lt;ref name="CDFA"&gt;{{cite web|title=ULSD Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ct.gov/deep/lib/deep/air/ultra_low_sulfur_diesel/ulsdfs.pdf|publisher=Clean Diesel Fuel Alliance|accessdate=27 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225141751/http://www.ct.gov/deep/lib/deep/air/ultra_low_sulfur_diesel/ulsdfs.pdf|archivedate=25 February 2017|format=PDF|quote=[[EPA]], the [[California Air Resources Board]], engine manufacturers and others have completed tests and demonstration programs showing that using the advanced emissions control devices enabled by the use of ULSD fuel reduces emissions of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen (precursors of ozone), as well as particulate matter to near-zero levels.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the [[European Union]] began mandating the reduction of diesel sulfur content and implementing modern ULSD specifications in 1999.&lt;ref name="EUR-Lex 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Council Directive 93/12/EEC of 23 March 1993 relating to the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:31993L0012|publisher=[[EUR-Lex]]|accessdate=27 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702130300/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:31993L0012|archivedate=2 July 2016|date=23 March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EUR-Lex 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Council Directive 1999/32/EC of 26 April 1999 relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels and amending Directive 93/12/EEC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:31999L0032|publisher=[[EUR-Lex]]|accessdate=27 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506202759/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:31999L0032|archivedate=6 May 2016|date=26 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]] started phasing in ULSD requirements for highway vehicles in 2006, with implementation for off-highway applications, such as locomotive and marine fuel, beginning in 2007.&lt;ref name="US EPA 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diesel Fuel Standards &amp; Rulemakings|url=https://www.epa.gov/diesel-fuel-standards/diesel-fuel-standards-rulemakings|publisher=[[US Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=27 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509223728/https://www.epa.gov/diesel-fuel-standards/diesel-fuel-standards-rulemakings|archivedate=9 May 2017|quote=Beginning in 2006, EPA began to phase-in more stringent regulations to lower the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel to 15 [[Parts-per notation|ppm]]. [...] From 2007 to 2014, low sulfur diesel fuel (specified at 500 ppm) and ULSD fuel was phased in for nonroad, locomotive, and marine (NRLM) diesel fuel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lubricity ==
Sulfur is not a [[lubricant]] in and of itself, but it can combine with the [[nickel]] content in many metal alloys to form a low melting point [[eutectic]] alloy that can increase lubricity. The process used to reduce the sulfur also reduces the fuel's lubricating properties. Lubricity is a measure of the fuel's ability to lubricate and protect the various parts of the engine's fuel injection system from wear. The processing required to reduce sulfur to 15 ppm also removes naturally occurring lubricity agents in diesel fuel. To manage this change ASTM International (formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials) adopted the lubricity specification defined in ASTM D975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D975.htm|title=ASTM D975 - 18 Standard Specification for Diesel Fuel Oils|website=www.astm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; for all diesel fuels and this standard went into effect January 1, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chevron.com/products/prodserv/fuels/diesel/ulsd.shtml|title=Chevron Products: Our Fuels: Products and Services: Diesel for Commercial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|access-date=2006-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024121414/http://www.chevron.com/products/prodserv/fuels/diesel/ulsd.shtml|archive-date=2006-10-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D975 standard defines two ULSD standards, Grade No. 2-D S15 (regular ULSD) and Grade No. 1-D S15 (a higher volatility fuel with a lower gelling temperature than regular ULSD).

The refining process that removes the sulfur also reduces the aromatic content and density of the fuel, resulting in a minor decrease in the energy content, by about 1%. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} This decrease in energy content may result in slightly reduced peak power and fuel economy.

The transition to ULSD is not without substantial costs. The US government has estimated that pump prices for diesel fuel will increase between $.05 and $.25 per gallon as a result of the transition. And, according to the American Petroleum Institute, the domestic refining industry has invested over $8 billion to comply with the new regulations.

ULSD will run in any engine designed for the ASTM D975 diesel fuels.

However, it is known to cause some seals to shrink,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chevron.com/products/ourfuels/prodserv/fuels/documents/elastomer_chevron_tb_2005Aug.pdf|title=Chevron paper|publisher=|access-date=2008-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229043108/http://www.chevron.com/products/ourfuels/prodserv/fuels/documents/elastomer_chevron_tb_2005Aug.pdf|archive-date=2008-02-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may cause fuel pump failures in [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|Volkswagen TDI]] engines used in 2006 to pre-2009 models.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} TDI engines from 2009 and on are designed to use ULSD exclusively; biodiesel blends are reported to prevent that failure.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrccc.org/images/Fuel_Quality_BMP_FINAL.pdf|title=HRCCC.org Biodiesel Best Management Practices|publisher=|access-date=2008-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229043109/http://www.hrccc.org/images/Fuel_Quality_BMP_FINAL.pdf|archive-date=2008-02-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==

=== Kenya ===
Some filling stations in Kenya started offering 50 ppm diesel as of December 2010.  As of 2018, Kenya has not fully implemented emission control systems.  It needs to work extra hard to regulate the emission systems on highway diesel engines which a factor to air pollution.

=== Mauritius ===
As of June 2012, 50 ppm diesel is now standard across all filling stations, in a bid to reduce pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/transport/pcfv/meetings/mauritius50ppm.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143728/http://www.unep.org/transport/pcfv/meetings/mauritius50ppm.asp |archivedate=2015-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morocco ===
Morocco has started to introduce 50 ppm diesel to filling stations as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2009/01/05/feature-01 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407032957/http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2009/01/05/feature-01 |archivedate=2012-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the 10 ppm diesel has been available in some filling stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leconomiste.com/article/883445-carburant-afriquia-n-attend-pas-2012|title=Carburant: Afriquia n’attend pas 2012|date=19 May 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A generalization to all filling stations with the 10 ppm diesel is available since December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.leconomiste.com/article/964156-de-bonnes-sources|title=De Bonnes Sources|date=31 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
50 ppm was first legislated by the South African Department of Minerals and Energy in early 2006, and has been widely available since then.

South Africa's Clean Fuels 2 standard, expected to begin in 2017, will reduce the allowable sulfur content to 10 ppm. [[Sasol]] has already launched 10 ppm diesel at selected filling stations as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/motoring/industry-news/sasol-launches-10ppm-clean-diesel-1.1611081#.UpNbXsQW1KJ|title=Sasol launches 10ppm clean diesel - IOL Motoring|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asia ==

===China===
China has limited sulfur in diesel fuel to 150 ppm (which is equivalent to the Euro III standard). The limits of 10 ppm (Which is equivalent to the Euro V standard), only applied for certain cities such as Beijing.&lt;ref name="中石化承认对雾霾天气有责任 称国家标准不够"&gt;[http://finance.qq.com/a/20130131/005638.htm?pgv_ref=aio2012&amp;ptlang=2052&lt;!-- http://finance.qq.com/a/20130131/005638.htm?pgv_ref=aio2012&amp;ptlang=2052 --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014 to 2017, China will limit sulfur in diesel fuel to 50ppm. After 2017, the sulfur content in diesel fuel will be limited to 10ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2013-02/06/c_114638328.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212183340/http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2013-02/06/c_114638328.htm |archivedate=2013-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
In July 2000, Hong Kong became the first city in Asia to introduce ULSD, with sulfur content of 50 parts per million (ppm). In addition, new petrol private cars were asked to meet [[Euro III]] standards from 2001.

Since the introduction of the law, all fuel station started supplying ULSD since August 2000.

Sulfur content of regular diesel fuel was lowered from 500 ppm to 350 ppm on 1 January 2001.

As part of the ULSD package, Hong Kong government lowered the tax for ULSD from HK$2.89 to $2.00 per litre in June 1998. The temporary concession was extended to 31 March 2000, then to 31 December 2000.

On 19 June 2000, under ''Report of the Subcommittee on resolution under section 4(2) of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (Cap. 109)'', ULSD fuel tax was lowered to HK$1.11 per litre between 7 July 2000 and 31 December 2000, then increased to $2 in 2001, then $2.89 per litre on 1 January 2002. This resolution was passed on 27 June 2000.

Under ''LC Paper No. LS 37/00-01'', which passed on 20 December 2000, the $1.11 per litre tax rate was extended to 30 June 2001.

Under ''LC Paper No. LS 115/00-01'', which passed on 20 June 2001, the $1.11 per litre tax rate was extended to 31 March 2002, then the tax would be raised to $2.89 per litre afterwards.

Under ''LC Paper No. LS 67/01-02'', which passed on 13 March 2002, the $1.11 per litre tax rate was extended to 31 March 2003.

Under ''LC Paper No. LS 76/02-03'', which passed on 19 March 2003, the $1.11 per litre tax rate was extended to 31 March 2004.

Under ''LC Paper No. LS 59/03-04'', which passed on 24 March 2004, the $1.11 per litre tax rate was extended to 31 December 2004.

[[Castle Peak Power Station]] was designed to burn [[heavy fuel oil]] for boiler startup, flame stabilisation and occasionally as a secondary fuel. Since the early 2010s, all boilers were converted to burn ULSD to cut down sulfur dioxide emission. On the other hand, [[Black Point Power Station]] and [[Penny's Bay Power Station]] were designed to burn ULSD as a secondary and primary fuel respectively. So all power stations under CLP Power burn ULSD instead of higher sulfur alternatives now.

===India===
Delhi first introduced 50 ppm sulfur diesel on 1 April 2010 as a step aimed at curbing vehicular pollution in the capital. This was done in 12 other cities at the same time. The sulfur content in the diesel being used was 350 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130411032621/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-03-30/news/28444546_1_diesel-vehicles-ulsd-vehicular-pollution ]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of diesel available in India from year 2010. Bharat Stage IV (equivalent to Euro IV) specification having Sulfur level below 50 ppm is available all over the country.

===Singapore===
The National Environment Agency (NEA) defines ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) as diesel fuel with less than 50ppm, or 0.005 per cent, by July 2017 the limit will be 10 ppm

On June 16, 2005, NEA announced that the use of ULSD would be mandatory beginning December 1, 2005. The regulation also offered tax incentives for [[Euro IV]] diesel taxis, buses and commercial vehicles between June 1, 2004 and September 3, 2006, pending a mandatory conversion to Euro IV-compliant vehicles in 2007.

===Taiwan===
Beginning on 1 July 2007, Taiwan has limited sulfur in diesel fuel to 10 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ivy5.epa.gov.tw/epalaw/docfile/040310z980729.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053553/http://ivy5.epa.gov.tw/epalaw/docfile/040310z980729.doc |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europe ==

=== European Union ===
In the [[European Union]], the “Euro IV” standard has applied since 2005, which specifies a maximum of 50 [[Parts per million|ppm]] of sulfur in diesel fuel for most highway vehicles;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shell.com/.../sg-en/shell_for_motorists/fuels/diesel/ulsd_faqs_0914.html?LN=/leftnavs/zzz_lhn4_3_4.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ultra-low-sulfur diesel with a maximum of 10 ppm of sulfur must “be available” from 2005 and was widely available as of 2008. In 2009, the Euro V fuel standard came into effect &lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/fuel.htmA ]{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reduced maximum sulfur to 10&amp;nbsp;ppm. In 2009, diesel fuel for most non-highway applications is also expected to conform to the Euro V standard for fuel. Various exceptions exist for certain uses and applications, most of which are being phased out over a period of several years. In particular, the so-called EU [[accession countries]] (primarily in [[Eastern Europe]]), have been granted certain temporary exemptions to allow for transition.

Certain EU countries may apply higher standards or require faster transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walshcarlines.com/pdf/Motor%20Vehicles%20and%20Fuels%20in%20Moscow.pdf|title=Presentation on mitigating fuel emissions, Noxious effects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Germany]] implemented a tax incentive of per litre of "sulfur free" fuel (both gasoline and diesel) containing less than 10 ppm beginning in January 2003 and average sulfur content was estimated in 2006 to be 3-5 ppm. Similar measures have been enacted in most of the [[Nordic countries]], [[Benelux]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to encourage early adoption of the 50&amp;nbsp;ppm and 10&amp;nbsp;ppm fuel standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walshcarlines.com/pdf/Cleaner%20Fuels%20and%20Cleaner%20Vehicles%20UN%20CSD.pdf|title=Cleaner Fuels and Cleaner Vehicles UN CSD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
Since 1990, diesel fuel with a sulfur content of 50&amp;nbsp;ppm (0.005%) has been available on the [[Sweden|Swedish]] market. From the year 1992, production started of a diesel fuel with 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;ppm of sulfur and a maximum of 5% by volume aromatics. There are certain tax incentives for using this fuel and from about year 2000, this low aromatic, low sulfur fuel has achieved 98-99% penetration of the Swedish diesel fuel market. Now RME (rapeseed methyl ester, also known as FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester)) is a biofuel additive.

Since 2003, a "zero" sulfur with very low aromatic content (less than 1% by volume) diesel fuel has been made available on the Swedish market under the name ''EcoPar''. It is used wherever the working environment is highly polluted, an example being where diesel trucks are used in confined spaces such as in harbours, inside storage houses, during construction of road and rail tunnels &amp; in vehicles that are predominantly run in city centres.

===Central and Eastern Europe (“Accession Countries”)===
As of 2008, most accession countries are expected to have made the transition to diesel fuel with 10 ppm sulfur or less. Slightly different times for transition have applied to each of the countries, but most have been required to reduce the maximum sulfur content to less than 50 ppm since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/gite/cleanfuels/ee.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017062700/http://www.un.org/esa/gite/cleanfuels/ee.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain exemptions are expected for certain industries and applications, which will also be phased out over time. Compared to other EU countries, ULSD may be less widely available.

====Serbia====
In [[Serbia]], an EU candidate country, all diesel fuel has been of the ultra-low-sulfur (''evrodizel'') type since August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/13/ekonomija/1368622/stize-novo-gorivo.html|title=Stiže novo gorivo|publisher=[[Radio Television of Serbia]]|language=sr|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, there were two types of diesel fuel: ''D2'' with 500&amp;nbsp;ppm sulfur or more, and low-sulfur ''evrodizel''.

== North America ==

===Canada===
Under ''Sulphur in Diesel Fuel Regulations'' (SOR/2002-254), the sulfur content of diesel fuel produced or imported was reduced to 15 ppm after 31 May 2006. This was followed by the reduction of sulfur in diesel fuel sold for use in on-road vehicles after 31 August 2006. For the designated [[Northern Supply Area]], the deadline for reducing the sulfur content of diesel fuel for use in on-road vehicles was 31 August 2007.

An amendment titled ''Regulations Amending the Sulphur in Diesel Fuel Regulations'' (SOR/2005-305) added following deadlines:

*concentration of sulfur in diesel fuel produced or imported for use in off-road engines shall not exceed 500 ppm from 1 June 2007 until 31 May 2010, and 15 ppm after that date.
*concentration of sulfur in diesel fuel sold for use in off-road engines shall not exceed 500 ppm from 1 October 2007 until 30 September 2010, and 15 ppm after that date.
*concentration of sulfur in diesel fuel sold in the northern supply area for use in off-road engines shall not exceed 500 ppm from 1 December 2008 until 30 November 2011, and 15 ppm after that date.
*concentration of sulfur in diesel fuel produced or imported for use in vessel engines or railway locomotive engines shall not exceed 500 parts per million (ppm) from 1 June 2007 until 31 May 2012, and 15 ppm after that date.

An amendment titled ''Regulations Amending the Sulphur in Diesel Fuel Regulations'' (SOR/SOR/2006-163) allowed diesel with sulfur content up to 22 ppm to be sold for onroad vehicles between 1 September 2006 and 15 October 2006, then 15 ppm after that date. This amendment facilitated the introduction of 15 ppm sulfur diesel fuel for on-road use in 2006, by lengthening the period between the dates that the production/import limit and the sales limit come into effect. It provided additional time to fully turn over the higher-sulfur diesel fuel inventory for on-road use in the distribution system. The requirements of the Regulations were aligned, in level and timing, with those of the U.S. EPA.

Mexico began introduction of ULSD throughout the country in 2006.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quiminet.com/noticias/inicia-pemex-la-distribucion-de-gasolina-premium-de-ultra-bajo-azufre-2287474.htm|title=Inicia PEMEX la distribución de gasolina Premium de ultra bajo azufre - QuimiNet.com|first=QuimiNet.com / e-Industria.com /|last=Marketizer.com|website=www.quiminet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel was proposed by [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] as a new standard for the sulfur content in on-road [[diesel fuel]] sold in the [[United States]] since October 15, 2006, except for rural Alaska which transferred in 2010. California has required it since September 1, 2006. This new regulation applies to all diesel fuel, diesel fuel additives and distillate fuels blended with diesel for on-road use, such as kerosene, however, it does not yet apply to [[railroad]] locomotives, marine, or off-road uses. Since December 1, 2010, all highway diesel fuel have been ULSD. [[Non-road diesel engine]] fuel was required to move to 500&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]] sulfur in 2007, and further to ULSD in 2010. Railroad locomotive and marine diesel fuel also moved to 500&amp;nbsp;ppm sulfur in 2007, and will change to ULSD in 2012. There are exemptions for small refiners of non-road, locomotive and marine diesel fuel that allow for 500&amp;nbsp;ppm diesel to remain in the system until 2014. After December 1, 2014 all highway, non-road, locomotive and marine diesel fuel produced and imported will be ULSD.

The EPA mandated the use of ULSD fuel in model year 2007 and newer highway diesel fuel engines equipped with advanced emission control systems that require the new fuel. These advanced emission control technologies will be required for marine diesel engines in 2014 and for locomotives in 2015.

The allowable sulfur content for ULSD (15&amp;nbsp;ppm) is much lower than the previous U.S. on-highway standard for low sulfur diesel (LSD, 500 ppm) which allows advanced emission control systems to be fitted that would otherwise be damaged and or rendered ineffective by these compounds. These systems can greatly reduce emissions of [[NOx|oxides of nitrogen]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]].&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

Because this grade of fuel is comparable to European grades, European engines will no longer have to be redesigned to cope with higher sulfur content in the U.S. These engines may use advanced emissions control systems which would otherwise be damaged by sulfur. Thus the ULSD standard is increasing the availability of diesel-fueled passenger cars in the U.S. In Europe, diesel-engined automobiles have been much more popular with buyers than has been the case in the U.S.

Additionally, the EPA is assisting manufacturers with the transition to tougher emissions regulations by loosening them for model year 2007 to 2010 light-duty diesel engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/tier2/amendments/420f06027.htm|title=Regulatory Announcement: Light-Duty Diesel Tier 2 Amendments - Tier 2 Vehicle &amp; Gasoline Sulfur Program - US EPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Honda, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, and others are expecting to begin producing diesel vehicles for the U.S. market to join those from Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Volkswagen, and BMW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/pricing/alternative-autos-and-fuels-1105/diesels/index.htm|title=Consumer Reports: New and Used Car Reviews and Ratings - Consumer Reports|website=Consumer Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to EPA estimates, with the implementation of the new fuel standards for diesel, nitrogen oxide emissions will be reduced by 2.6 million tons each year and soot or particulate matter will be reduced by 110,000 tons a year.

On June 1, 2006, U.S. refiners were required to produce 80% of their annual output as ULSD (15 ppm), and petroleum marketers and retailers were required to label&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clean-diesel.org/images/DPLabelFacts121406.pdf |title=Factsheet |website=http://www.clean-diesel.org/images/DPLabelFacts121406.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; diesel fuel, diesel fuel additives and kerosone pumps with EPA-authorized language disclosing fuel type and sulfur content. Other requirements effective June 1, 2006, including EPA-authorized language on Product Transfer Documents and sulfur-content testing standards, are designed to prevent misfueling, contamination by higher-sulfur fuels and liability issues. The EPA deadline for industry compliance to a 15 ppm sulfur content was originally set for July 15, 2006 for distribution terminals, and by September 1, 2006 for retail. But on November 8, 2005, the deadline was extended by 1.5 months to September 1, 2006 for terminals and October 15, 2006 for retail. In California, the extension was not granted and followed the original schedule. As of December, 2006, the ULSD standard has been in effect according to the amended schedule, and compliance at retail locations was reported to be in place.

=== Argentina ===
Argentina has three grades of diesel fuel, as follows:

Grade 1, also known as AGRODIESEL or GASOIL AGRO, is intended mainly for agricultural equipment. Sale of Grade 1 diesel is optional at retail outlets.
Grade 2, also known as GASOIL COMUN (common diesel fuel), is intended for the bulk of diesel fuelled vehicles. Grade 2 diesel fuel is available with 2 different sulfur levels depending on the population density of the location where it is retailed.
Grade 3 diesel fuel, also known as GASOIL ULTRA, is the highest quality diesel fuel and is supposed to be available starting February 1, 2006. Sale of Grade 3 diesel at retail outlets is optional until 2008.
At the time the regulation was published, the sulfur limits amounted to 3000 ppm for Grade 1, 1500/2500 ppm (depending on the area) for Grade 2, and 500 ppm for Grade 3. Sulfur limit reductions occur in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2016. After the last reduction, in June 2016, the sulfur limits become 1000 ppm, 30 ppm, and 10 ppm for the three respective grades.

Law 26.093 requires 5% biodiesel to be blended with diesel fuel starting January 1, 2010.

=== Brazil ===
Since January 2012, Brazilian service stations started offering two types of Diesel, 50 ppm and 500 ppm on most areas and 1800 ppm in remote areas. Since January 2013 The 10 ppm or EURO V Diesel replaced the 50 ppm Diesel, which is now widely used and can be found in the majority of service stations, and the 1800 ppm was discontinued. All vehicles produced or sold in Brazil since January 2012 must be able to use only 50 ppm or lower sulfur Diesel.
Also, all Diesel available for purchase in Brazil contains 5% of Biodiesel.

=== Uruguay ===
Uruguay is expected to impose a 50-ppm ULSD limit by 2009. 70% of the fuel used in Uruguay is diesel.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

== Oceania ==

===Australia===
Australia has had a limit of 10&amp;nbsp;ppm since 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/environment-protection/fuel-quality/standards/diesel "Diesel Fuel Quality Standard"] Government of Australia&lt;/ref&gt; The limit had been 50ppm.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand has had a limit of 10&amp;nbsp;ppm since 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2008/0138/latest/DLM1325291.html?search=ts_regulation_Engine+Fuel_resel#DLM1325291 "Schedule 2: Requirements for diesel"] Government of New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, the limit was 50&amp;nbsp;ppm.

==Russia and the former Soviet Union==
As of 2002, much of the former Soviet Union still applied limits on sulfur in diesel fuel substantially higher than in Western Europe. Maximum levels of 2,000 and 5,000&amp;nbsp;ppm were applied for different uses. In Russia, lower maximum levels of 350&amp;nbsp;ppm and 500&amp;nbsp;ppm sulfur in automotive fuel were enforced in certain areas, particularly in regions. Euro IV and Euro V fuel with a concentration of 50&amp;nbsp;ppm or less was available at certain fueling stations, at least in part to comply with emissions control equipment on foreign-manufactured cars and trucks, number of which is increased every year, especially in big cities, such as Moscow and Saint Petersburg. According to the technical regulation, selling a fuel with sulfur content over 50&amp;nbsp;ppm was allowed until 31 December 2011. Euro IV diesel may in particular be available at fueling stations selling to long-distance truck fleets servicing import and export flows between Russia and the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/gite/cleanfuels/ee.pdf Automotive Fuel Markets in Eastern/Central Europe &amp; Former Soviet Union (FSU)]&lt;/ref&gt;
