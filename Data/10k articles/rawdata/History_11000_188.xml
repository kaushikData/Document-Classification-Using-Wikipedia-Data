      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5053">'''Arnfinn Moland''' (born 25 August 1951) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] historian.

He was born in [[Kvinesdal]]. He finished his secondary education in [[Flekkefjord]] in 1970, served in [[Hans Majestet Kongens Garde|His Majesty the King's Guard]] from 1973 to 1974, and graduated from the [[University of Oslo]] with the [[cand.philol.]] degree in 1977.&lt;ref name=ntb&gt;{{cite news|title=Arnfinn Moland 50 år 25. august|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=3 August 2001|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His master's thesis was ''Prissubsider eller støtte?

Representing [[Kvinesdal IL]], he achieved a [[long jump]] of 6.91 metres in July 1978 at [[Lovisenlund]] in [[Larvik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/at/sen/MLJ.htm |title=Norwegian all-time list, men's long jump |publisher=Norwegian Athletics |language=Norwegian |accessdate=1 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205231614/http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/at/sen/MLJ.htm |archivedate=February 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had 14.34 metres in the [[triple jump]], achieved in July 1978 at [[Stovnerbanen]] in [[Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/at/sen/MTJ.htm |title=Norwegian all-time list, men's triple jump |publisher=Norwegian Athletics |language=Norwegian |accessdate=1 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603033557/http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/at/sen/MTJ.htm |archivedate=June 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moland was hired as a researcher by [[Norway's Resistance Museum]] in 1978. From 1993 to 1997 he worked for the [[Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies]]. He was the director of Norway's Resistance Museum from 1995, from 1998 with the title of [[associate professor]].&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt;

His first major book was ''Hjemmefront'', volume six of the series ''Norge i krig''. The volume was released in 1987 together with [[Ivar Kraglund]]. In 1997 he released ''"Strengt hemmelig". Norsk etterretningsteneste 1945-1970'', about Norwegian intelligence, together with [[Olav Riste]]. In the same year he released ''Milorg i Stor-Oslo. Distrikt 13s historie'' together with Terje Diesen, about the Greater Oslo district of [[Milorg]]. In 1999 followed ''Over grensen? Hjemmefrontens likvidasjoner under den tyske okkupasjonen av Norge 1940-1945'' about Norwegian liquidations of Nazi collaborators.&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt;&lt;ref name=publ&gt;[http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/show?pid=010351116&amp;kid=biblio List of publications] in [[BIBSYS]]&lt;/ref&gt; This book has been described as a contrast to [[Egil Ulateig]]'s book ''Med rett til å drepe''.&lt;ref name=dagbl2000&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2000/11/25/229756.html|title=NS-avkom i norske aviser|last=Mikalsen|first=Espen H.|author2=Aas Olsen, Trygve|date=25 November 2000|work=[[Dagbladet]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also contributed to film. He was a screenwriter and co-director of the film ''Rapport fra "Nr. 24"'' about [[Gunnar Sønsteby]].&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt; The book ''Gunnar Sønsteby. 24 kapitler i Kjakans liv'' followed in 2004.&lt;ref name=publ/&gt; In 2008 Moland published the book ''Max Manus. Film og virkelighet'', which followed the release of the film ''[[Max Manus (film)|Max Manus]]''. Exploring the relationship between the film and the real-life [[Max Manus]], the book was written together with the film's screenwriter [[Thomas Nordseth-Tiller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torp-Holte |first=Torill |year=2009 |title=Tikken versus Max |journal=[[Prosa]] |volume=15 |issue=3 |language=Norwegian |url=http://www.prosa.no/artikkel.asp?ID=479 |accessdate=1 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108212736/http://www.prosa.no/artikkel.asp?ID=479 |archivedate=8 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moland has not been entirely uncontroversial as a historian. In 2000 he accused Norwegian newspapers of printing untrue stories about the [[Norwegian resistance movement]], because "relatives of [[Nasjonal Samling]] sympathizers" sat as editors in these newspapers. The statement was sharply criticized by editors such as [[Harald Stanghelle]], [[Steinar Hansson]] and [[Gudleiv Forr]].&lt;ref name=dagbl2000/&gt;

'''Athanasius II Baldoyo''' ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]: ''ܐܬܢܐܣܝܘܣ ܕܬܪܝܢ ܒܠܕܝܐ'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''اثناسيوس الثاني البلدي''), also known as '''Athanasius of Balad''' and '''Athanasius of Nisibis''', was the [[List of Syriac Patriarchs of Antioch from 512 to 1783|Patriarch of Antioch]], and head of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] from 683 until his death in 686.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"&gt;Barsoum (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Athanasius was born in the city of Balad in [[Upper Mesopotamia]] and studied sciences, [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], with his friend [[Jacob of Edessa|Jacob]], under the tutelage of [[Severus Sebokht]] at the Monastery of Qinnasrin. He moved to the Monastery of Beth Malke, near Antioch, not the Monastery of Mar Malke in [[Tur Abdin]] as originally believed, and became a monk. Athanasius studied philosophy and translated several Greek theological and philosophical works into Syriac, such as [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''[[Isagoge]]'' in January 645.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt;

Athanasius later became a priest and moved to [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]], where he continued to translate Greek texts into Syriac. In 666-667, he translated nine treatises of the ''[[Hexameron]]'' of [[Basil of Caesarea]], as suggested by Matthew, Bishop of Aleppo, and Daniel, Bishop of Edessa. Matthew and Daniel later requested a translation of several letters of [[Severus of Antioch]] into Syriac which was complete in 669, under the pen-name of "Athanasius of Nisibis". Athanasius also translated Severus' ''Second Discourse against Nephalius'', several homilies by [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], and the ''Corpus Areopagiticum'' by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]].&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt;

Athanasius was consecrated patriarch at the end of 683 and issued a ten-page proclamation,&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt; and four canons on Christian conduct with Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann &amp; Pennington (2012), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; He condemned the consumption of sacrificial meat, participation in Muslim festivals, and relationships with Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyland (1997), pp. 148-149&lt;/ref&gt; In 684, he ordained his friend [[Jacob of Edessa|Jacob]] as bishop of Edessa. Athanasius also wrote a number of supplication prayers, several of which were to be used at the celebration of the Eucharist, and prayers for the dead. He died at the end of 686.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt;

'''Bagrat Uasyl-ipa Shinkuba''' ({{lang-ab|Баграҭ Уасыл-иҧа Шьынқәба}}; {{lang-ru|Баграт Васильевич Шинкуба}}; 12 May 1917 in Chlou, [[Ochamchira District]], [[Sukhum Okrug]], [[Kutais Governorate]] &amp;ndash; 25 February 2004) was an Abkhaz writer, poet, historian, linguist and politician. He studied history and languages of [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]], [[Adyghe people|Adyghe]] and [[Ubykh people|Ubykh]] people. His novel ''The Last of the Departed'' is dedicated to the tragic destiny of Ubykh nation, which became extinct along a hundred of years.

In 1958—1978 he was the Chairman of the Supreme Council Presidium of the [[Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Abkhaz ASSR]].

According to Jumber Patiashvili, in 1947 Shinkuba sent a letter "to Kremlin, requesting from Stalin and Beria separation of Abkhazia from Georgia and awarding it the status of an independent republic."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geworld.ge/View.php?ArtId=2857&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clóvis Beviláqua''' (4 October 1859 – 26 July 1944) was a [[Brazil]]ian jurist, historian and journalist born in [[Viçosa do Ceará]], [[Ceará]], in 1859. Beviláqua was professor of civil and comparative law in [[Recife]]. As the author of the [[Brazilian Civil Code]] of 1916, whose first draft he presented in 1899, and as that code's first commentator, Beviláqua was the founding father of Brazilian [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] scholarship. He founded and occupied the 14th chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]], from 1897 until his death in 1944. The chair's patron is [[Franklin Távora]].

The '''composing hut of Gustav Mahler''', German: '''Gustav Mahler-Komponierhäuschen''', is a little [[museum]] and [[memorial]] in Maiernigg, near [[Maria Wörth]] in [[Carinthia]], [[Austria]]. It is dedicated to the classical composer [[Gustav Mahler]] (1860-1911). In this hut he retreated from 1900 to 1907 in order to compose music. Since 7 July 1986 a permanent exhibition can be seen here.

There is also a [[Composing hut of Gustav Mahler (Attersee)|composing hut at the Attersee]], [[Upper Austria]],&lt;ref&gt;Georg Föttinger, [https://www.mahler-steinbach.at/english/composing-cottage/ Composing hut of Gustav Mahler Steinbach], Mahler Steinbach&lt;/ref&gt; and one next to the [[Gustav Mahler Stube]] in [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter Algemeine, [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/reise/nah/gustav-mahler-in-toblach-flucht-vor-den-kuhgaesten-12143263.html Flucht vor den Kuhgästen], 9 April 2017 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Maria Wörth Sekirn Wörthersee-Süduferstraße 23 Villa Siegel 30072004 01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Villa Mahler]]
Mahler came to Maiernigg in 1900 and had this composing hut built by Alfred Theuer from 1900 to 1901.&lt;ref name="IGMS"&gt;International Gustav Mahler Society, [https://gustav-mahler.org/gedenkstaetten/maiernigg.cfm Maiernigg am Wörthersee (Kärnten)] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retreated to this hut in order to compose music. At the time he was director and conductor of the court opera of [[Vienna]] (later the [[Vienna State Opera]]). The hut was of practical use for Mahler, because there was no time left for him to compose when he was in Vienna.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;National Austrian Bureau for Tourism, [https://views.austria.info/de/media?page=5&amp;type=text#!/11507 Gustav Mahler (1860-1911) - Das Wichtigste in der Musik steht nicht in den Noten] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the hut ''Study auf dem Kogel''&lt;ref name="KLaL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pianoinstituut" /&gt;

In Maiernigg he completed his [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|4th]], [[Symphony No. 5 (Mahler)|5th]], [[Symphony No. 6 (Mahler)|6th]], [[Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)|7th]] and parts of [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|8th symphony]]. After his daughter Maria died on 12 July 1907, Mahler left his vacation home and went to Schluderbach in [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]], where he spent the rest op his vacation.&lt;ref name="IGMS" /&gt;

The composing hut was declared a [[cultural heritage]] in 1981. In 1985 it was renovated by the Gustav Mahler society from [[Klagenfurt]]. It was opened on 7 July 1986. This society does not exist any more and the composing hut is being maintained by the city of Klagenfurt. It was renewed in 2016.&lt;ref name="IGMS" /&gt;

Damon taught at [[Harvard University]] as Assistant Professor from 1990-1995,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; at [[Amherst College]] as Assistant Professor and Professor 1995-2007, and moved to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] as Professor of Classical Studies in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/cynthia-damon/33564/|title=Cynthia Damon|website=www.penguin.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.classics.upenn.edu/sites/www.classics.upenn.edu/files/damoncvupdatedfeb2018.pdf|title=Cynthia Damon CV|last=|first=|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Damon was awarded the College of Liberal and Professional Studies Distinguished Teaching Award for Standing Faculty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sas.upenn.edu/lps/students/current/graduation/faculty-awards-2015|title=Faculty Awards for 2015 {{!}} The College of Liberal and Professional Studies (LPS)|website=www.sas.upenn.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damon was the editor of ''[[Transactions of the American Philological Association]]'' from 2001 to 2005&lt;ref&gt;[https://gustavus.edu/classics/cam/10-06CAMnewsletter.pdf Classical Association of Minnesota newsletter, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the Board of Directors of the [[American Philological Association]] from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://classicalstudies.org/publications-and-research/newsletter/spring-2010-newsletter APA newsletter, Spring 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Damon is part of ''[[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/editors.html|title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review (BMCR) Editorial Board|website=bmcr.brynmawr.edu|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 Damon published ''The Mask of the Parasite: A Pathology of Roman Patronage'' based on her doctoral thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mEJ-aA_XQQQC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=%22Cynthia+Damon%22+dissertation+stanford+university&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VUsJtyoX6T&amp;sig=4PwPEvrF4mLD3D9HRoFSQ8ScDkM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiYhtKUx8bcAhVMDcAKHVQYCRUQ6AEwBHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cynthia%20Damon%22%20dissertation%20stanford%20university&amp;f=false|title=The Mask of the Parasite: A Pathology of Roman Patronage|last=Damon|first=Cynthia|last2=Damon|first2=Professor of Classical Studies Cynthia|date=1997|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472107607|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997 Damon has focused on the translation of and commentaries on key classical texts including works by [[Augustus]], [[Cornelius Nepos|Nepos]], [[Tacitus]], and [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]. Damon was awarded a [[Loeb Classical Library]] Foundation Fellowship in 2013/14 to work on a new translation of [[Caesar's Civil War]], which was published in 2016 replacing the 1914 version by A. G. Peskett.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL039/2016/volume.xml|title=Caesar, Civil War {{!}} Loeb Classical Library|work=Loeb Classical Library|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently focusing on [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny's ''Natural History'']] and its reception&lt;ref name="upenn" /&gt; and delivered a keynote address ''Plinian layers: On editing the reception of Pliny’s planetary theory'' in 2016 at the conference ''The Arts of Editing: Past, Present and Future'' (17–19 August 2016) at [[Stockholm University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arsedendi.org/?page_id=1777|title=− Conference August 2016|website=www.arsedendi.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damon has been praised for her meticulous approach to texts. For example, Antonio Moreno Hernández commented on ''Studies on the Text of Caesar's Bellum civile'':&lt;blockquote&gt;This excellent edition makes serious contributions to the reconstruction of the text, and its careful and deep reading of the text of BC and the close study of its textural tradition is accompanied by an insightful commentary on troublesome passages that brings to light the enormous complexity of a text that has been transmitted in such a deficient way, offering suggestive new proposals that will encourage reflection on the reading and interpretation of the work of Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/studies-on-the-text-of-caesars-bellum-civile-9780198724063?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Studies on the Text of Caesar's Bellum civile|date=2015-11-24|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198724063|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernández|first=Antonio Moreno|date=2018|title=Review of: C.

{{short description|cyber attack disrupting service by overloading the provider of the service}}
[[File:Stachledraht DDos Attack.svg|thumb|DDoS [[Stacheldraht]] attack diagram.]]
In [[computing]], a '''denial-of-service attack''' ('''DoS attack''') is a [[cyber-attack]] in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended [[user (computing)|users]] by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting [[network service|services]] of a [[host (network)|host]] connected to the [[Internet]]. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015|title=Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks|publisher=US-CERT|date=6 February 2013|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a '''distributed denial-of-service attack''' ('''DDoS attack'''), the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single source.

A DoS or DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter, disrupting trade.

Criminal perpetrators of DoS attacks often target sites or services hosted on high-profile [[web server]]s such as banks or [[credit card]] [[payment gateway]]s.

== History ==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Court testimony shows that the first demonstration of DoS attack was made by Khan C. Smith in 1997 during a [[DEF CON]] event, disrupting Internet access to the [[Las Vegas Strip]] for over an hour. The release of sample code during the event led to the online attack of [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]], [[EarthLink]], [[E-Trade]], and other major corporations in the year to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Steve|title=5 Famous Botnets that held the internet hostage|url=https://tqaweekly.com/episodes/season5/tqa-se5ep11.php|publisher=tqaweekly|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2018, an unnamed customer of the US-based service provider [[Arbor Networks]] fell victim to the largest DDoS in history, reaching a peak of about 1.7 terabits per second.&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/03/us-service-provider-survives-the-biggest-recorded-ddos-in-history/&lt;/ref&gt; The previous record was set a few days earlier, on March 1, 2018, GitHub was hit by an attack of 1.35 terabits per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-was-hit-with-the-largest-ddos-attack-ever-seen/|title=GitHub hit with the largest DDoS attack ever seen {{!}} ZDNet|last=Ranger|first=Steve|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Denial-of-service attacks are characterized by an explicit attempt by attackers to prevent legitimate use of a service. There are two general forms of DoS attacks: those that crash services and those that flood services. The most serious attacks are distributed.&lt;ref name="Taghavi Zargar 2046–2069"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/19225/1/FinalVersion.pdf |title=A Survey of Defense Mechanisms Against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Flooding Attacks |first=Saman |last=Taghavi Zargar |publisher=IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS &amp; TUTORIALS |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=2046–2069 |date=November 2013 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{visible anchor|Distributed DoS|Distributed_attack}}===
A '''distributed denial-of-service''' ('''DDoS''') is a large-scale DoS attack where the perpetrator uses more than one unique [[IP address]], often thousands of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/930795667|title=Theoretical and experimental methods for defending against DDoS attacks|last=Khalifeh,|first=Soltanian, Mohammad Reza|others=Amiri, Iraj Sadegh, 1977-|isbn=0128053992|location=Waltham, MA|oclc=930795667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources, it is impossible to stop the attack simply by using [[ingress filtering]]. It also makes it very difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin. As an alternative or augmentation of a DDoS, attacks may involve forging of IP sender addresses ([[IP address spoofing]]) further complicating identifying and defeating the attack.

The scale of DDoS attacks has continued to rise over recent years, by 2016 exceeding a [[terabit per second]].&lt;ref name="Goodin"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Goodin |first=Dan |date=28 September 2016 |title=Record-breaking DDoS reportedly delivered by &gt;145k hacked cameras |publisher=Ars Technica |url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/09/botnet-of-145k-cameras-reportedly-deliver-internets-biggest-ddos-ever/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002000235/http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/09/botnet-of-145k-cameras-reportedly-deliver-internets-biggest-ddos-ever/ |archive-date=2 October 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://thehackernews.com/2016/09/ddos-attack-iot.html |title=World's largest 1 Tbps DDoS Attack launched from 152,000 hacked Smart Devices |last=Khandelwal |first=Swati |date=26 September 2016 |publisher=The Hacker News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930031903/https://thehackernews.com/2016/09/ddos-attack-iot.html |archive-date=30 September 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common examples of DDoS attacks are [[Fraggle attack|fraggle]], [[Smurf attack|smurf]], and [[SYN flooding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/948286117|title=DDoS attacks : evolution, detection, prevention, reaction, and tolerance|last=Kumar,|first=Bhattacharyya, Dhruba|others=Kalita, Jugal Kumar,|isbn=9781498729659|location=Boca Raton, FL|oclc=948286117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application layer attacks===
An '''application layer DDoS attack''' (sometimes referred to as '''layer 7 DDoS attack''') is a form of DDoS attack where attackers target [[application layer|application-layer]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Lee | first =Newton | authorlink = | title =Counterterrorism and Cybersecurity: Total Information Awareness | publisher =Springer | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2013 | location = | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =9781461472056 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Infosec7Layer"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Layer Seven DDoS Attacks | newspaper =Infosec Institute | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack over-exercises specific functions or features of a website with the intention to disable those functions or features. This application-layer attack is different from an entire network attack, and is often used against financial institutions to distract IT and security personnel from security breaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Gartner Says 25 Percent of Distributed Denial of Services Attacks in 2013 Will Be Application - Based | newspaper =Gartner | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =21 February 2013 | url =http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2344217 | accessdate =28 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, application-layer DDoS attacks represented 20% of all DDoS attacks.&lt;ref name="AbABankinJournal"&gt;{{cite news | last =Ginovsky | first =John | coauthors = | title =What you should know about worsening DDoS attacks | newspaper =ABA Banking Journal| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =27 January 2014 | url =http://www.ababj.com/component/k2/item/4354-what-you-should-know-about-worsening-ddos-attacks | accessdate =28 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research by [[Akamai Technologies]], there have been "51 percent more application layer attacks" from Q4 2013 to Q4 2014 and "16 percent more" from Q3 2014 over Q4 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.akamai.com/2015/01/q4-2014-state-of-the-internet---security-report-some-numbers.html|title=Q4 2014 State of the Internet - Security Report: Numbers  - The Akamai Blog|website=blogs.akamai.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017; Junade Ali, a Computer Scientist at [[Cloudflare]] noted that whilst network-level attacks continue to be of high capacity, they are occurring less frequently. Ali further notes that although network-level attacks are becoming less frequent, data from Cloudflare demonstrates that application-layer attacks are still showing no sign of slowing down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ali|first1=Junade|title=The New DDoS Landscape|url=https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-new-ddos-landscape/|website=Cloudflare Blog|date=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Application layer====
The [[OSI model]] (ISO/IEC 7498-1) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the internal functions of a communication system by partitioning it into [[abstraction layer]]s. The model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). The model groups similar communication functions into one of seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the communications path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that traverse that path.

In the OSI model, the definition of its [[application layer]] is narrower in scope than is often implemented. The OSI model defines the application layer as being the user interface. The OSI application layer is responsible for displaying data and images to the user in a human-recognizable format and to interface with the [[presentation layer]] below it. In an implementation, the application and presentation layers are frequently combined.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

====Method of attack====
An application layer DDoS attack is done mainly for specific targeted purposes, including disrupting transactions and access to databases. It requires fewer resources than network layer attacks but often accompanies them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Higgins |first=Kelly Jackson |coauthors= |title=DDoS Attack Used ‘Headless’ Browser In 150-Hour Siege |newspaper=Dark Reading |location= |pages= |language= |publisher=InformationWeek |date=17 October 2013 |url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-15/240162777 |accessdate=28 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122165039/http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-15/240162777 |archivedate=January 22, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An attack is disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets.&lt;ref name="AbABankinJournal"/&gt; The attack on the application layer can disrupt services such as the retrieval of information or search function&lt;ref name="AbABankinJournal"/&gt; as well as web browser function, email services and photo applications. To be deemed a ''distributed'' denial of service attack, more than around 3–5 nodes on different networks should be used; using fewer nodes qualifies as a DoS attack but not a DDoS attack.&lt;ref name="Infosec7Layer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Raghavan | first =S.V. | authorlink = | title =An Investigation into the Detection and Mitigation of Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks | publisher =Springer | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2011 | location = | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =9788132202776| mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced persistent DoS===
An '''advanced persistent DoS''' (APDoS) is more likely to be perpetrated by an [[advanced persistent threat]] (APT): attackers who are well-resourced, exceptionally skilled and have access to substantial commercial grade computer resources and capacity. APDoS attacks represent a clear and emerging threat needing specialised monitoring and incident response services and the defensive capabilities of specialised [[DDoS mitigation]] service providers.

This type of attack involves massive network layer DDoS attacks through to focused application layer (HTTP) floods, followed by repeated (at varying intervals) SQLi and XSS attacks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cyberwarfare Sourcebook|last=Kiyuna and Conyers|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=1329063945|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Random SQL injection and XSS during a DDoS sounds dubious|date=December 2016}} Typically, the perpetrators can simultaneously use from 2 to 5 attack vectors involving up to several tens of millions of requests per second, often accompanied by large SYN floods that can not only attack the victim but also any service provider implementing any sort of managed DDoS mitigation capability. These attacks can persist for several weeks. The longest continuous period noted so far lasted 38 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ilascu |first1=Ionut |title=38-Day Long DDoS Siege Amounts to Over 50 Petabits in Bad Traffic |url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/38-Day-Long-DDoS-Siege-Amounts-to-Over-50-Petabits-in-Bad-Traffic-455722.shtml |accessdate=29 July 2018 |agency=Softpedia News |date=Aug 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attack involved approximately 50+ petabits (50,000+ terabits) of malicious traffic.

Attackers in this scenario may tactically switch between several targets to create a diversion to evade defensive DDoS countermeasures but all the while eventually concentrating the main thrust of the attack onto a single victim. In this scenario, attackers with continuous access to several very powerful network resources are capable of sustaining a prolonged campaign generating enormous levels of un-amplified DDoS traffic.

APDoS attacks are characterised by:
* advanced reconnaissance (pre-attack [[open-source intelligence|OSINT]] and extensive decoyed scanning crafted to evade detection over long periods)
* tactical execution (attack with both primary and secondary victims but focus is on primary)
* explicit motivation (a calculated end game/goal target)
* large computing capacity (access to substantial computer power and network bandwidth)
* simultaneous multi-threaded OSI layer attacks (sophisticated tools operating at layers 3 through 7)
* persistence over extended periods (combining all the above into a concerted, well managed attack across a range of targets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmagazineuk.com/video-games-company-hit-by-38-day-ddos-attack/article/367329/|title=Video games company hit by 38-day DDoS attack|last=Gold|first=Steve|date=21 August 2014|work=SC Magazine UK|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denial-of-service as a service===
Some vendors provide so-called "booter" or "stresser" services, which have simple web-based front ends, and accept payment over the web. Marketed and promoted as stress-testing tools, they can be used to perform unauthorized denial-of-service attacks, and allow technically unsophisticated attackers access to sophisticated attack tools without the need for the attacker to understand their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/stress-testing-the-booter-services-financially/|title=Stress-Testing the Booter Services, Financially|last=Krebs|first=Brian|date=August 15, 2015|website=Krebs on Security|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually powered by a [[botnet]], the traffic produced by a consumer stresser can range anywhere from 5-50&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s, which can, in most cases, deny the average home user internet access.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Symptoms==
The [[United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team]] (US-CERT) has identified symptoms of a denial-of-service attack to include:&lt;ref name="US-CERT1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/st04-015|title=Cyber Security Tip ST04-015 - Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks |publisher=[[United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team]] |date=November 4, 2009&lt;!--last updated February 06, 2013--&gt; |first=Mindi |last=McDowell |accessdate=December 11, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104052804/http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/st04-015 |archivedate=2013-11-04 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* unusually slow [[network performance]] (opening files or accessing web sites)
* unavailability of a particular web site
* inability to access any web site
* dramatic increase in the number of spam emails received (this type of DoS attack is considered an [[e-mail bomb]]).

Additional symptoms may include:
* disconnection of a wireless or wired internet connection
* long-term denial of access to the web or any internet services.

If the attack is conducted on a sufficiently large scale, entire geographical regions of Internet connectivity can be compromised without the attacker's knowledge or intent by incorrectly configured or flimsy network infrastructure equipment.

==Attack techniques==
A wide array of programs are used to launch DoS-attacks.

===Attack tools===
In cases such as [[MyDoom]] and Slowloris the tools are embedded in malware, and launch their attacks without the knowledge of the system owner. [[Stacheldraht]] is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a [[Client (computing)|client program]] to connect to handlers, which are compromised systems that issue commands to the [[Zombie computer|zombie agents]], which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker, using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.&lt;ref name="Dittrich" /&gt;

In other cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner's consent, for example, in [[Operation Payback]], organized by the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. The [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon|LOIC]] has typically been used in this way. Along with [[High Orbit Ion Cannon|HOIC]] a wide variety of DDoS tools are available today, including paid and free versions, with different features available. There is an underground market for these in hacker related forums and IRC channels.

UK's [[GCHQ]] has tools built for DDoS, named PREDATORS FACE and ROLLING THUNDER.&lt;ref name="firstlook.org"/&gt;

===Application-layer floods===

Various DoS-causing [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] such as [[buffer overflow]] can cause server-running software to get confused and fill the disk space or consume all available memory or [[CPU time]].

Other kinds of DoS rely primarily on brute force, flooding the target with an overwhelming flux of packets, oversaturating its connection bandwidth or depleting the target's system resources. Bandwidth-saturating floods rely on the attacker having higher bandwidth available than the victim; a common way of achieving this today is via distributed denial-of-service, employing a [[botnet]]. Another target of DDoS attacks may be to produce added costs for the application operator, when the latter uses resources based on [[cloud computing]]. In this case normally application used resources are tied to a needed Quality of Service level (e.g. responses should be less than 200 ms) and this rule is usually linked to automated software (e.g. Amazon CloudWatch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/|title=Amazon CloudWatch|work=Amazon Web Services, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to raise more virtual resources from the provider in order to meet the defined QoS levels for the increased requests.The main incentive behind such attacks may be to drive the application owner to raise the elasticity levels in order to handle the increased application traffic, in order to cause financial losses or force them to become less competitive. Other floods may use specific packet types or connection requests to saturate finite resources by, for example, occupying the maximum number of open connections or filling the victim's disk space with logs.

A "banana attack" is another particular type of DoS. It involves redirecting outgoing messages from the client back onto the client, preventing outside access, as well as flooding the client with the sent packets. A [[LAND]] attack is of this type.

An attacker with shell-level access to a victim's computer may slow it until it is unusable or crash it by using a [[fork bomb]].

A kind of application-level DoS attack is [[XDoS]] (or XML DoS) which can be controlled by modern web [[application firewall]]s (WAFs).

===Degradation-of-service attacks===
"Pulsing" zombies are compromised computers that are directed to launch intermittent and short-lived floodings of victim websites with the intent of merely slowing it rather than crashing it. This type of attack, referred to as "degradation-of-service" rather than "denial-of-service", can be more difficult to detect than regular zombie invasions and can disrupt and hamper connection to websites for prolonged periods of time, potentially causing more disruption than concentrated floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia Of Information Technology |page=397 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors |year=2007 |isbn=81-269-0752-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Internet and the Law |year=2006 |page=325 |first=Aaron |last=Schwabach |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1-85109-731-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure of degradation-of-service attacks is complicated further by the matter of discerning whether the server is really being attacked or under normal traffic loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Networking and Mobile Computing |first=Xicheng |last=Lu |author2=Wei Zhao |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2005 |isbn=3-540-28102-9 |page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denial-of-service Level II===
The goal of DoS L2 (possibly DDoS) attack is to cause a launching of a defense mechanism which blocks the network segment from which the attack originated. In case of distributed attack or IP header modification (that depends on the kind of security behavior) it will fully block the attacked network from the Internet, but without system crash.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Distributed DoS attack===
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers.&lt;ref name="Taghavi Zargar 2046–2069"/&gt; Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example, a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic. A botnet is a network of zombie computers programmed to receive commands without the owners' knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Has Your Website Been Bitten By a Zombie?|url=http://blog.cloudbric.com/2015/08/has-your-website-been-bitten-by-zombie.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Cloudbric|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a server is overloaded with connections, new connections can no longer be accepted. The major advantages to an attacker of using a distributed denial-of-service attack are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than one machine, multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than one attack machine, and that the behavior of each attack machine can be stealthier, making it harder to track and shut down. These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms. For example, merely purchasing more incoming bandwidth than the current volume of the attack might not help, because the attacker might be able to simply add more attack machines. This, after all, will end up completely crashing a website for periods of time.

Malware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms; one of the better-known examples of this was [[MyDoom]]. Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time. This type of DDoS involved hardcoding the target IP address prior to release of the malware and no further interaction was necessary to launch the attack.

A system may also be compromised with a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]], allowing the attacker to download a [[Zombie computer|zombie agent]], or the trojan may contain one. Attackers can also break into systems using automated tools that exploit flaws in programs that listen for connections from remote hosts. This scenario primarily concerns systems acting as servers on the web. [[Stacheldraht]] is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a [[Client (computing)|client program]] to connect to handlers, which are compromised systems that issue commands to the [[Zombie computer|zombie agents]], which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker, using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.&lt;ref name="Dittrich"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/stacheldraht.analysis.txt |title=The "stacheldraht" distributed denial of service attack tool |first=David |last=Dittrich |publisher=University of Washington |date=December 31, 1999 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner's consent, for example, in [[Operation Payback]], organized by the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. These attacks can use different types of internet packets such as: TCP, UDP, ICMP etc.

These collections of systems compromisers are known as [[botnet]]s / [[rootserver]]s. DDoS tools like [[Stacheldraht]] still use classic DoS attack methods centered on [[IP spoofing]] and amplification like [[smurf attack]]s and [[fraggle attack]]s (these are also known as bandwidth consumption attacks). [[SYN flood]]s (also known as resource starvation attacks) may also be used. Newer tools can use DNS servers for DoS purposes. Unlike MyDoom's DDoS mechanism, botnets can be turned against any IP address. [[Script kiddie]]s use them to deny the availability of well known websites to legitimate users.&lt;ref name="SANS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/resources/idfaq/trinoo.php|title=SANS Institute – Intrusion Detection FAQ: Distributed Denial of Service Attack Tools: n/a|accessdate=2008-05-02|publisher=SANS Institute|year=2000|first=Phillip |last=Boyle}}&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated attackers use DDoS tools for the purposes of [[extortion]]{{spaced ndash}}even against their business rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leyden |first=John |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/23/authorize_ddos_attack/ |title=US credit card firm fights DDoS attack |work=The Register |date=2004-09-23 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple attacks such as SYN floods may appear with a wide range of source IP addresses, giving the appearance of a well distributed DoS. These flood attacks do not require completion of the TCP [[Three way handshake#Connection establishment|three way handshake]] and attempt to exhaust the destination SYN queue or the server bandwidth. Because the source IP addresses can be trivially spoofed, an attack could come from a limited set of sources, or may even originate from a single host. Stack enhancements such as [[syn cookies]] may be effective mitigation against SYN queue flooding, however complete bandwidth exhaustion may require involvement.{{elucidate|date=May 2011}}

If an attacker mounts an attack from a single host it would be classified as a DoS attack. In fact, any attack against availability would be classed as a denial-of-service attack. On the other hand, if an attacker uses many systems to simultaneously launch attacks against a remote host, this would be classified as a DDoS attack.

It has been reported that there are new attacks from [[internet of things]] which have been involved in denial of service attacks.

===DDoS extortion===
In 2015, DDoS botnets such as DD4BC grew in prominence, taking aim at financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's Behind DDoS Attacks and How Can You Protect Your Website?|url=http://blog.cloudbric.com/2015/09/whos-behind-ddos-attacks-and-how-can.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Cloudbric|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber-extortionists typically begin with a low-level attack and a warning that a larger attack will be carried out if a ransom is not paid in [[Bitcoin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=Cyber-Extortionists Targeting the Financial Sector Are Demanding Bitcoin Ransoms|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-09/bitcoin-ddos-ransom-demands-raise-dd4bc-profile?mod=djemRiskCompliance|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Bloomberg|date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security experts recommend targeted websites to not pay the ransom. The attackers tend to get into an extended extortion scheme once they recognize that the target is ready to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=Adam|title=Akamai warns of increased activity from DDoS extortion group|url=http://www.scmagazineuk.com/akamai-warns-of-increased-activity-from-ddos-extortion-group/article/438333/|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=SC Magazine|date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HTTP POST DoS attack===
First discovered in 2009, the HTTP POST attack sends a complete, legitimate [[POST (HTTP)|HTTP POST header]], which includes a 'Content-Length' field to specify the size of the message body to follow. However, the attacker then proceeds to send the actual message body at an extremely slow rate (e.g. 1 byte/110 seconds). Due to the entire message being correct and complete, the target server will attempt to obey the 'Content-Length' field in the header, and wait for the entire body of the message to be transmitted, which can take a very long time. The attacker establishes hundreds or even thousands of such connections, until all resources for incoming connections on the server (the victim) are used up, hence making any further (including legitimate) connections impossible until all data has been sent. It is notable that unlike many other (D)DoS attacks, which try to subdue the server by overloading its network or CPU, a HTTP POST attack targets the ''logical'' resources of the victim, which means the victim would still have enough network bandwidth and processing power to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/images/4/43/Layer_7_DDOS.pdf|title=OWASP Plan - Strawman - Layer_7_DDOS.pdf|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=18 March 2014|website= Open Web Application Security Project|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further combined with the fact that [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] will, by default, accept requests up to 2GB in size, this attack can be particularly powerful. HTTP POST attacks are difficult to differentiate from legitimate connections, and are therefore able to bypass some protection systems. [[OWASP]], an [[open source]] web application security project, has released a [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_HTTP_Post_Tool testing tool] to test the security of servers against this type of attacks.

===Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood===
A [[smurf attack]] relies on misconfigured network devices that allow packets to be sent to all computer hosts on a particular network via the [[broadcast address]] of the network, rather than a specific machine. The attacker will send large numbers of [[Internet Protocol|IP]] packets with the source address faked to appear to be the address of the victim. Most devices on a network will, by default, respond to this by sending a reply to the source IP address. If the number of machines on the network that receive and respond to these packets is very large, the victim's computer will be flooded with traffic. This overloads the victim computer and can even make it unusable during such attack.&lt;ref name="ANML-DDoS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anml.iu.edu/ddos/types.html|title=Types of DDoS Attacks |publisher=Advanced Networking Management Lab (ANML) |work=Distributed Denial of Service Attacks(DDoS) Resources, Pervasive Technology Labs at Indiana University |date=December 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914222536/http://anml.iu.edu/ddos/types.html |archivedate=2010-09-14 |accessdate=December 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ping flood]] is based on sending the victim an overwhelming number of [[ping (networking utility)|ping]] packets, usually using the "ping" command from [[Unix-like]] hosts (the -t flag on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] systems is much less capable of overwhelming a target, also the -l (size) flag does not allow sent packet size greater than 65500 in Windows). It is very simple to launch, the primary requirement being access to greater [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] than the victim.

[[Ping of death]] is based on sending the victim a malformed ping packet, which will lead to a system crash on a vulnerable system.

The [[BlackNurse (Computer Security)|BlackNurse]] attack is an example of an attack taking advantage of the required Destination Port Unreachable ICMP packets.

===Nuke===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
A Nuke is an old denial-of-service attack against [[computer networking|computer networks]] consisting of fragmented or otherwise invalid [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] packets sent to the target, achieved by using a modified [[ping (networking utility)|ping]] utility to repeatedly send this corrupt data, thus slowing down the affected computer until it comes to a complete stop.

A specific example of a nuke attack that gained some prominence is the [[WinNuke]], which exploited the vulnerability in the [[NetBIOS]] handler in [[Windows 95]]. A string of out-of-band data was sent to [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] port 139 of the victim's machine, causing it to lock up and display a [[Blue Screen of Death]] (BSOD).

===Peer-to-peer attacks===
{{Main|Direct Connect (protocol)#Direct Connect used for DDoS attacks}}
Attackers have found a way to exploit a number of bugs in [[peer-to-peer]] servers to initiate DDoS attacks. The most aggressive of these peer-to-peer-DDoS attacks exploits [[DC++]]. With peer-to-peer there is no botnet and the attacker does not have to communicate with the clients it subverts. Instead, the attacker acts as a "puppet master," instructing clients of large [[file sharing|peer-to-peer file sharing]] hubs to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to connect to the victim's website instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prolexic.com/news/20070514-alert.php|title=Prolexic Distributed Denial of Service Attack Alert |accessdate=2007-08-22|author=Paul Sop|date=May 2007|work=Prolexic Technologies Inc.|publisher=Prolexic Technologies Inc. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070803175513/http://www.prolexic.com/news/20070514-alert.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11466|title=Peer-to-peer networks co-opted for DOS attacks|accessdate=2007-08-22|author=Robert Lemos|date=May 2007|work=|publisher=SecurityFocus }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcpp.wordpress.com/2007/05/22/denying-distributed-attacks/|title=Denying distributed attacks|accessdate=2007-08-22|author=Fredrik Ullner|date=May 2007|work=|publisher=DC++: Just These Guys, Ya Know? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permanent denial-of-service attacks===
Permanent denial-of-service (PDoS), also known loosely as phlashing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phlashing attack thrashes embedded systems|first=John|last=Leyden|date=2008-05-21|accessdate=2009-03-07|work=The Register|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/21/phlashing/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an attack that damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware.&lt;ref name="TechWeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=154270&amp;WT.svl=news1_1|title=Permanent Denial-of-Service Attack Sabotages Hardware|publisher=Dark Reading |date=May 19, 2008 |first=Kelly |last=Jackson Higgins |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208002732/http://www.darkreading.com/security/management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=211201088 |archivedate=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the distributed denial-of-service attack, a PDoS attack exploits security flaws which allow remote administration on the management interfaces of the victim's hardware, such as routers, printers, or other [[networking hardware]]. The attacker uses these vulnerabilities to replace a device's [[firmware]] with a modified, corrupt, or defective firmware image—a process which when done legitimately is known as ''flashing.'' This therefore "[[brick (electronics)|bricks]]" the device, rendering it unusable for its original purpose until it can be repaired or replaced.

The PDoS is a pure hardware targeted attack which can be much faster and requires fewer resources than using a botnet or a root/vserver in a DDoS attack. Because of these features, and the potential and high probability of security exploits on Network Enabled Embedded Devices (NEEDs), this technique has come to the attention of numerous hacking communities.

PhlashDance is a tool created by Rich Smith (an employee of Hewlett-Packard's Systems Security Lab) used to detect and demonstrate PDoS vulnerabilities at the 2008 [http://eusecwest.com/ EUSecWest Applied Security Conference] in London.&lt;ref name="EUSecWest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eusecwest.com/speakers.html#PhlashDance|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201173324/http://eusecwest.com/speakers.html#PhlashDance|archivedate=2009-02-01|title=EUSecWest Applied Security Conference: London, U.K.|publisher=EUSecWest|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflected / spoofed attack===
A distributed denial-of-service attack may involve sending forged requests of some type to a very large number of computers that will reply to the requests. Using [[IP address spoofing|Internet Protocol address spoofing]], the source address is set to that of the targeted victim, which means all the replies will go to (and flood) the target.  (This reflected attack form is sometimes called a "DRDOS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetsociety.org/sites/default/files/01_5.pdf|title=Amplification Hell: Revisiting Network Protocols for DDoS Abuse|first=Christian|last=Rossow|publisher=Internet Society|date=February 2014|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[ICMP Echo Request]] attacks ([[Smurf attack]]) can be considered one form of reflected attack, as the flooding host(s) send Echo Requests to the broadcast addresses of mis-configured networks, thereby enticing  hosts to send Echo Reply packets to the victim. Some early DDoS programs implemented a distributed form of this attack.

===Amplification===
Amplification attacks are used to magnify the bandwidth that is sent to a victim. This is typically done through publicly accessible [[DNS]] servers that are used to cause congestion on the target system using DNS response traffic. Many services can be exploited to act as reflectors, some harder to block than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Paxson|first=Vern |year=2001|url=http://www.icir.org/vern/papers/reflectors.CCR.01/reflectors.html |title=An Analysis of Using Reflectors for Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks |publisher=ICIR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; US-CERT have observed that different services implies in different amplification factors, as tabulated below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=July 8, 2014 |title=Alert (TA14-017A) UDP-based Amplification Attacks |publisher=US-CERT |url=http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-017A |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNS amplification attacks involve a new mechanism that increased the amplification effect, using a much larger list of DNS servers than seen earlier. The process typically involves an attacker sending a DNS name look up request to a public DNS server, spoofing the source IP address of the targeted victim. The attacker tries to request as much information as possible, thus amplifying the DNS response that is sent to the targeted victim. Since the size of the request is significantly smaller than the response, the attacker is easily able to increase the amount of traffic directed at the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2006|url=http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf |title=DNS Amplification Attacks |publisher=ISOTF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214074629/http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14|author1=Vaughn, Randal |author2=Evron, Gadi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=July 8, 2013 |title=Alert (TA13-088A) DNS Amplification Attacks |publisher=US-CERT |url=http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNMP and [[Network Time Protocol|NTP]] can also be exploited as reflector in an amplification attack.

An example of an amplified DDoS attack through the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) is through a command called monlist, which sends the details of the last 600 hosts that have requested the time from the NTP server back to the requester. A small request to this time server can be sent using a spoofed source IP address of some victim, which results in a response 556.9 times the size of the request being sent to the victim. This becomes amplified when using botnets that all send requests with the same spoofed IP source, which will result a massive amount of data being sent back to the victim.

It is very difficult to defend against these types of attacks because the response data is coming from legitimate servers. These attack requests are also sent through UDP, which does not require a connection to the server. This means that the source IP is not verified when a request is received by the server. In order to bring awareness of these vulnerabilities, campaigns have been started that are dedicated to finding amplification vectors which has led to people fixing their resolvers or having the resolvers shut down completely.

=== Miarai Botnet ===
This attack works by using a worm to infect hundreds of thousands of  IoT devices across the country or even the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7971869/authors#authors|title=DDoS in the IoT: Mirai and Other Botnets - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worm propagates through networks and systems taking control of poorly protected IoT devices such as, thermostats, Wi-Fi enabled clocks, washing machines and many more&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7971869/authors#authors|title=DDoS in the IoT: Mirai and Other Botnets - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These newly enslaved devices are called slaves or bots. Once the hacker has acquired his or her desired number of bots they instruct the bots to try and contact an ISP. In October of 2016, a Mirai botnet attacked Dyn which is the ISP for sites such as Twitter, Netflix, etc. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7971869/authors#authors|title=DDoS in the IoT: Mirai and Other Botnets - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As soon as this occurred, these websites were all unreachable for several hours costing each company thousands of dollars. The thing about this type of attack is when the device becomes enslaved usually the user will not be able to tell &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuzmanovic|first=Aleksandar|last2=Knightly|first2=Edward W.|date=2003-08-25|title=Low-rate TCP-targeted denial of service attacks: the shrew vs. the mice and elephants|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=863955.863966|publisher=ACM|pages=75–86|doi=10.1145/863955.863966|isbn=1581137354}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The device itself is not the one that the attacker is after they just need to use it to be a part of a bigger attack &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuzmanovic|first=Aleksandar|last2=Knightly|first2=Edward W.|date=2003-08-25|title=Low-rate TCP-targeted denial of service attacks: the shrew vs. the mice and elephants|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=863955.863966|publisher=ACM|pages=75–86|doi=10.1145/863955.863966|isbn=1581137354}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This type of attack is not physically damaging, but it will certainly be costly for any large internet companies that get attacked.

===R-U-Dead-Yet? (RUDY)===
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/r-u-dead-yet/ RUDY] attack targets web applications by starvation of available sessions on the web server. Much like [[Slowloris (software)|Slowloris]], RUDY keeps sessions at halt using never-ending POST transmissions and sending an arbitrarily large content-length header value.

===Shrew attack===
The shrew attack is a denial-of-service attack on the [[Transmission Control Protocol]]. It uses short synchronized bursts of traffic to disrupt TCP connections on the same link, by exploiting a weakness in TCP's re-transmission timeout mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Yu Chen | last2 = Kai Hwang | last3 = Yu-Kwong Kwok | doi = 10.1109/LCN.2005.70 | chapter = Filtering of shrew DDoS attacks in frequency domain | title = The IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks 30th Anniversary (LCN'05)l | pages = 8 pp | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7695-2421-4 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slow Read attack ===
A slow read attack sends legitimate application layer requests, but reads responses very slowly, thus trying to exhaust the server's connection pool. It is achieved by advertising a very small number for the TCP Receive Window size, and at the same time emptying clients' TCP receive buffer slowly, which causes a very low data flow rate.

{{anchor|DDoS}}

===Sophisticated low-bandwidth Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack===
A sophisticated low-bandwidth DDoS attack is a form of DoS that uses less traffic and increases their effectiveness by aiming at a weak point in the victim's system design, i.e., the attacker sends traffic consisting of complicated requests to the system.&lt;ref name="Ben-Porat 1031–1043"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Vulnerability of Network Mechanisms to Sophisticated DDoS Attacks|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6158635|journal = IEEE Transactions on Computers|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 0018-9340|pages = 1031–1043|volume = 62|issue = 5|doi = 10.1109/TC.2012.49|first = U.|last = Ben-Porat|first2 = A.|last2 = Bremler-Barr|first3 = H.|last3 = Levy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, a  sophisticated DDoS attack is lower in cost due to its use of less traffic, is smaller in size making it more difficult to identify, and it has the ability to hurt systems which are protected by flow control mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Ben-Porat 1031–1043"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/slow-http-test/|title=Slow HTTP Test|author=orbitalsatelite|work=SourceForge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===(S)SYN flood===
{{See also|SYN flood}}
A [[SYN flood]] occurs when a host sends a flood of TCP/SYN packets, often with a forged sender address. Each of these packets are handled like a connection request, causing the server to spawn a [[half-open connection]], by sending back a TCP/SYN-ACK packet (Acknowledge), and waiting for a packet in response from the sender address (response to the ACK Packet). However, because the sender address is forged, the response never comes. These half-open connections saturate the number of available connections the server can make, keeping it from responding to legitimate requests until after the attack ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4987 |title=TCP SYN Flooding Attacks and Common Mitigations |website=Tools.ietf.org |date=August 2007 |accessdate=2011-12-02 |rfc=4987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teardrop attacks===
A teardrop attack involves sending [[Mangled packet|mangled]] [[Internet Protocol|IP]] fragments with overlapping, oversized payloads to the target machine. This can crash various operating systems because of a bug in their [[TCP/IP]] [[IPv4#Fragmentation and reassembly|fragmentation re-assembly]] code.&lt;ref name="CERT-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cert.org/historical/advisories/ca-1997-28.cfm|title=CERT Advisory CA-1997-28 IP Denial-of-Service Attacks|accessdate=July 18, 2014|publisher=CERT|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows 3.1x]], [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT]] operating systems, as well as versions of [[Linux]] prior to versions 2.0.32 and 2.1.63 are vulnerable to this attack.

(Although in September 2009, a vulnerability in [[Windows Vista]] was referred to as a "teardrop attack", this targeted [[Server Message Block|SMB2]] which is a higher layer than the TCP packets that teardrop used).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/windows-7-vista-exposed-to-teardrop-attack/4222 |title=Windows 7, Vista exposed to 'teardrop attack' |publisher=ZDNet |date=September 8, 2009 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/975497.mspx |title=Microsoft Security Advisory (975497): Vulnerabilities in SMB Could Allow Remote Code Execution |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=September 8, 2009 &lt;!--last updated February 06, 2013--&gt;|accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the fields in an IP header is the “fragment offset” field, indicating the starting position, or offset, of the data contained in a fragmented packet relative to the data in the original packet. If the sum of the offset and size of one fragmented packet differs from that of the next fragmented packet, the packets overlap. When this happens, a server vulnerable to teardrop attacks is unable to reassemble the packets - resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

===Telephony denial-of-service (TDoS)===
[[Voice over IP]] has made abusive origination of large numbers of [[telephone]] voice calls inexpensive and readily automated while permitting call origins to be misrepresented through [[caller ID spoofing]].

According to the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) has appeared as part of various fraudulent schemes:
* A scammer contacts the victim's banker or broker, impersonating the victim to request a funds transfer. The banker's attempt to contact the victim for verification of the transfer fails as the victim's telephone lines are being flooded with thousands of bogus calls, rendering the victim unreachable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/newark/press-releases/2010/nk051110.htm |title=FBI — Phony Phone Calls Distract Consumers from Genuine Theft |publisher=FBI.gov |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus claim to collect an outstanding [[payday loan]] for thousands of dollars. When the consumer objects, the scammer retaliates by flooding the victim's employer with thousands of automated calls. In some cases, displayed caller ID is spoofed to impersonate police or law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic3.gov/media/2013/130107.aspx |title= Internet Crime Complaint Center's (IC3) Scam Alerts January 7, 2013 |work=IC3.gov |date=2013-01-07 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus debt collection demand and threatens to send police; when the victim balks, the scammer floods local police numbers with calls on which caller ID is spoofed to display the victims number. Police soon arrive at the victim's residence attempting to find the origin of the calls.

Telephony denial-of-service can exist even without [[Internet telephony]]. In the [[2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal]], [[telemarketing|telemarketers]] were used to flood political opponents with spurious calls to jam phone banks on election day. Widespread publication of a number can also flood it with enough calls to render it unusable, as happened by accident in 1981 with multiple +1-[[area code]]-867-5309 subscribers inundated by hundreds of misdialed calls daily in response to the song [[867-5309/Jenny]].

TDoS differs from other [[telephone harassment]] (such as [[prank call]]s and [[obscene phone call]]s) by the number of calls originated; by occupying lines continuously with repeated automated calls, the victim is prevented from making or receiving both routine and emergency telephone calls.

Related exploits include [[SMS flooding]] attacks and [[black fax]] or fax loop transmission.

=== UPnP attack ===
This attack uses an existing vulnerability in [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) protocol to get around a considerable amount of the present defense methods and flood a target's network and servers. The attack is based on a DNS amplification technique, but the attack mechanism is a UPnP router which forwards requests from one outer source to another disregarding UPnP behavior rules. Using the UPnP router returns the data on an unexpected UDP port from a bogus IP address, making it more hard to take simple action to shut down the traffic flood. According to the [[Imperva]] researchers, the most effective way to stop this attack is for companies to lock down UPnP routers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.darkreading.com/new-ddos-attack-method-leverages-upnp/d/d-id/1331799|title=New DDoS Attack Method Leverages UPnP|work=Dark Reading|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.imperva.com/blog/2018/05/new-ddos-attack-method-demands-a-fresh-approach-to-amplification-assault-mitigation/|title=New DDoS Attack Method Demands a Fresh Approach to Amplification Assault Mitigation – Blog {{!}} Imperva|date=2018-05-14|work=Blog {{!}} Imperva|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defense techniques==
Defensive responses to denial-of-service attacks typically involve the use of a combination of attack detection, traffic classification and response tools, aiming to block traffic that they identify as illegitimate and allow traffic that they identify as legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Loukas | first1 = G. | last2 = Oke | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1093/comjnl/bxp078 | title = Protection Against Denial of Service Attacks: A Survey | journal = [[The Computer Journal|Comput. J.]] | volume = 53 | issue = 7 | pages = 1020–1037 | date=September 2010 | origyear = August 2009| pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://staffweb.cms.gre.ac.uk/~lg47/publications/LoukasOke-DoSSurveyComputerJournal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of prevention and response tools is provided below:

===Application front end hardware===
Application front-end hardware is intelligent hardware placed on the network before traffic reaches the servers. It can be used on networks in conjunction with routers and switches. Application front end hardware analyzes data packets as they enter the system, and then identifies them as priority, regular, or dangerous. There are more than 25 [[bandwidth management]] vendors.

===Application level Key Completion Indicators===
{{original research|section|date=March 2018|the analogy is complex enough that it should be sourced}}
Approaches to DDoS attacks against cloud-based applications may be based on an application layer analysis, indicating whether incoming bulk traffic is legitimate and thus triggering elasticity decisions without the economical implications of a DDoS attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alqahtani|first1=S.|last2=Gamble|first2=R. F.|title=DDoS Attacks in Service Clouds|journal=2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)|date=1 January 2015|pages=5331–5340|doi=10.1109/HICSS.2015.627}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches mainly rely on an identified path of value inside the application and monitor the progress of requests on this path, through markers called Key Completion Indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kousiouris|first=George|title=KEY COMPLETION INDICATORS:minimizing the effect of DoS attacks on elastic Cloud-based applications based on application-level markov chain checkpoints |url=http://www.scitepress.org/DigitalLibrary/Link.aspx?doi=10.5220/0004963006220628|newspaper=CLOSER Conference|date=2014|accessdate=2015-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, these technique are statistical methods of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on.

An analogy is to a bricks-and-mortar department store where customers spend, on average, a known percentage of their time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back, filling a basket, waiting to pay, paying, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. If a mob of customers arrived in store and spent all their time picking up items and putting them back, but never made any purchases, this could be flagged as unusual behavior.

The department store can attempt to adjust to periods of high activity by bringing in a reserve of employees at short notice. But if it did this routinely, were a mob to start showing up but never buying anything, this could ruin the store with the extra employee costs. Soon the store would identify the mob activity and scale back the number of employees, recognising that the mob provides no profit and should not be served. While this may make it more difficult for legitimate customers to get served during the mob's presence, it saves the store from total ruin.

In the case of elastic cloud services where a huge and abnormal additional workload may incur significant charges from the cloud service provider, this technique can be used to scale back or even stop the expansion of server availability to protect from economic loss.

===Blackholing and sinkholing===
With [[blackhole routing]], all the traffic to the attacked DNS or IP address is sent to a "black hole" (null interface or a non-existent server). To be more efficient and avoid affecting network connectivity, it can be managed by the ISP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Patrikakis |first1=C. |last2=Masikos |first2=M. |last3=Zouraraki |first3=O. |title=Distributed Denial of Service Attacks |journal=The Internet Protocol Journal |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=13–35 |date=December 2004 |url=http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_7-4/dos_attacks.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[DNS sinkhole]] routes traffic to a valid IP address which analyzes traffic and rejects bad packets. Sinkholing is not efficient for most severe attacks.

===IPS based prevention===
[[Intrusion prevention system]]s (IPS) are effective if the attacks have signatures associated with them. However, the trend among the attacks is to have legitimate content but bad intent. Intrusion-prevention systems which work on content recognition cannot block behavior-based DoS attacks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

An [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] based IPS may detect and block denial-of-service attacks because they have the [[Bandwidth (computing)|processing power]] and the granularity to analyze the attacks and act like a [[circuit breaker]] in an automated way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

A [[RateBasedIPS|rate-based IPS]] (RBIPS) must analyze traffic granularly and continuously monitor the traffic pattern and determine if there is traffic anomaly. It must let the legitimate traffic flow while blocking the DoS attack traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abante|first=Carl|title=Relationship between Firewalls and Protection against DDoS|url=http://www.ecommercewisdom.com/relationship-firewalls-protection-ddos/|newspaper=Ecommerce Wisdom|date=March 2, 2013|accessdate=2013-05-24}}{{dubious|date=December 2013|reason=SPS non-expert unreliable blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DDS based defense===
More focused on the problem than IPS, a DoS defense system (DDS) can block connection-based DoS attacks and those with legitimate content but bad intent. A DDS can also address both protocol attacks (such as teardrop and ping of death) and rate-based attacks (such as ICMP floods and SYN floods).

===Firewalls===
In the case of a simple attack, a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] could have a simple rule added to deny all incoming traffic from the attackers, based on protocols, ports or the originating IP addresses.

More complex attacks will however be hard to block with simple rules: for example, if there is an ongoing attack on port 80 (web service), it is not possible to drop all incoming traffic on this port because doing so will prevent the server from serving legitimate traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/94014/How_to_defend_against_DDoS_attacks|first=Paul |last=Froutan|title=How to defend against DDoS attacks|work=[[Computerworld]]|date=June 24, 2004|accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, firewalls may be too deep in the network hierarchy, with routers being adversely affected before the traffic gets to the firewall. Also, many security tools still do not support IPv6 or may not be configured properly, so the firewalls often might get bypassed during the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252445613/Cyber-security-vulnerability-concerns-skyrocket|title=Cyber security vulnerability concerns skyrocket|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Routers===
Similar to switches, routers have some rate-limiting and [[Access control list|ACL]] capability. They, too, are manually set. Most routers can be easily overwhelmed under a DoS attack. [[Cisco IOS]] has optional features that can reduce the impact of flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mehmet.suzen.googlepages.com/qos_ios_dos_suzen2005.pdf |title=Some IoS tips for Internet Service (Providers) |first=Mehmet |last=Suzen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910202908/http://mehmet.suzen.googlepages.com/qos_ios_dos_suzen2005.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switches===
Most switches have some rate-limiting and [[Access control list|ACL]] capability. Some switches provide automatic and/or system-wide [[rate limiting]], [[traffic shaping]], [[delayed binding]] ([[TCP splicing]]), [[deep packet inspection]] and [[Bogon filtering]] (bogus IP filtering) to detect and remediate DoS attacks through automatic rate filtering and WAN Link failover and balancing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

These schemes will work as long as the DoS attacks can be prevented by using them. For example, SYN flood can be prevented using delayed binding or TCP splicing. Similarly content based DoS may be prevented using deep packet inspection. Attacks originating from [[Martian packet|dark addresses]] or going to dark addresses can be prevented using [[bogon filtering]]. Automatic rate filtering can work as long as set rate-thresholds have been set correctly. Wan-link failover will work as long as both links have DoS/DDoS prevention mechanism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===Upstream filtering===
All traffic is passed through a "cleaning center" or a "scrubbing center" via various methods such as proxies, tunnels, digital cross connects, or even direct circuits, which separates "bad" traffic (DDoS and also other common internet attacks) and only sends good traffic beyond to the server. The provider needs central connectivity to the Internet to manage this kind of service unless they happen to be located within the same facility as the "cleaning center" or "scrubbing center". DDoS attacks can overwhelm any type of hardware firewall, and passing malicious traffic through large and mature networks becomes more and more effective and economically sustainable against DDoS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://research.sprintlabs.com/publications/uploads/RR04-ATL-013177.pdf |title=DDoS Mitigation via Regional Cleaning Centers (Jan 2004) |format=PDF |work=SprintLabs.com |publisher=Sprint ATL Research |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921012859/http://research.sprintlabs.com/publications/uploads/RR04-ATL-013177.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-21 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;!-- use archive due to outage--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unintentional denial-of-service==
An unintentional denial-of-service can occur when a system ends up denied, not due to a deliberate attack by a single individual or group of individuals, but simply due to a sudden enormous spike in popularity. This can happen when an extremely popular website posts a prominent link to a second, less well-prepared site, for example, as part of a news story. The result is that a significant proportion of the primary site's regular users{{spaced ndash}}potentially hundreds of thousands of people{{spaced ndash}}click that link in the space of a few hours, having the same effect on the target website as a DDoS attack. A VIPDoS is the same, but specifically when the link was posted by a celebrity.

When [[Death of Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson died]] in 2009, websites such as Google and Twitter slowed down or even crashed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8120324.stm | work=BBC News | first=Maggie | last=Shiels | title=Web slows after Jackson's death | date=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sites' servers thought the requests were from a virus or spyware trying to cause a denial-of-service attack, warning users that their queries looked like "automated requests from a [[computer virus]] or spyware application".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=&lt;!--last updated February 06, 2013--&gt;http://productforums.google.com/forum/?#!category-topic/websearch/unexpected-search-results/uFcXXixhiBw |title=We're Sorry. Automated Query error |work=Google Product Forums › Google Search Forum  |publisher=Google.com |date=October 20, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News sites and link sites{{spaced ndash}}sites whose primary function is to provide links to interesting content elsewhere on the Internet{{spaced ndash}}are most likely to cause this phenomenon. The canonical example is the [[Slashdot effect]] when receiving traffic from [[Slashdot]]. It is also known as "the [[Reddit]] hug of death" and "the [[Digg]] effect".

Routers have also been known to create unintentional DoS attacks, as both [[D-Link]] and [[Netgear]] routers have overloaded NTP servers by flooding NTP servers without respecting the restrictions of client types or geographical limitations.

Similar unintentional denials-of-service can also occur via other media, e.g. when a URL is mentioned on television. If a server is being indexed by [[Google]] or another [[search engine]] during peak periods of activity, or does not have a lot of available bandwidth while being indexed, it can also experience the effects of a DoS attack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{citation needed|reason=I've never seen Google send more than one request per minute to my server, usually much less often than that.  Other crawlers may be more aggressive though.  Do we have a reliable source about this?|date=March 2013}}

Legal action has been taken in at least one such case. In 2006, [[Universal Tube &amp; Rollform Equipment|Universal Tube &amp; Rollform Equipment Corporation]] sued [[YouTube]]: massive numbers of would-be youtube.com users accidentally typed the tube company's URL, utube.com. As a result, the tube company ended up having to spend large amounts of money on upgrading their bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=YouTube sued by sound-alike site |work=BBC News |date=2006-11-02 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6108502.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company appears to have taken advantage of the situation, with utube.com now containing ads for advertisement revenue.

In March 2014, after [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]] went missing, [[DigitalGlobe]] launched a [[crowdsourcing]] service on which users could help search for the missing jet in satellite images. The response overwhelmed the company's servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wnmufm.org/post/people-overload-website-hoping-help-search-missing-jet|title=People Overload Website, Hoping To Help Search For Missing Jet|author=Bill Chappell|publisher=NPR|date=12 March 2014|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unintentional denial-of-service may also result from a prescheduled event created by the website itself, as was the case of the [[Census in Australia]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://delimiter.com.au/2016/08/19/experts-cast-doubt-census-ddos-claims/|title=Experts cast doubt on Census DDoS claims|date=19 August 2016|accessdate=31 January 2018|last=Palmer|first=Daniel|publisher=Delimiter}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be caused when a server provides some service at a specific time. This might be a university website setting the grades to be available where it will result in many more login requests at that time than any other.

==Side effects of attacks==

===Backscatter===
{{see also|Backscatter (email)|Internet background noise}}
In computer network security, backscatter is a side-effect of a spoofed denial-of-service attack. In this kind of attack, the attacker spoofs (or forges) the source address in [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] sent to the victim. In general, the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets, so the victim responds to the spoofed packets as it normally would. These response packets are known as backscatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caida.org/publications/animations/ |work=Animations |title=Backscatter Analysis (2001) |type=video |publisher=[[Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis]] |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the attacker is spoofing source addresses randomly, the backscatter response packets from the victim will be sent back to random destinations. This effect can be used by [[network telescope]]s as indirect evidence of such attacks.

The term "backscatter analysis" refers to observing backscatter packets arriving at a statistically significant portion of the [[IP address]] space to determine characteristics of DoS attacks and victims.

==Legality==
{{see also|Computer crime}}

Many jurisdictions have laws under which denial-of-service attacks are illegal.

* In the US, denial-of-service attacks may be considered a federal crime under the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] with penalties that include years of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title18/html/USCODE-2010-title18-partI-chap47-sec1030.htm |title=United States Code: Title 18,1030. Fraud and related activity in connection with computers &amp;#124; Government Printing Office |publisher=www.gpo.gov |date=2002-10-25|accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section]] of the US [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] handles cases of (D)DoS.
* In [[Europe]]an countries, committing criminal denial-of-service attacks may, as a minimum, lead to arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Action Against DD4BC Cybercriminal Group|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/international-action-against-dd4bc-cybercriminal-group|website=EUROPOL|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] is unusual in that it specifically outlawed denial-of-service attacks and set a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison with the [[Police and Justice Act 2006]], which amended Section 3 of the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer Misuse Act 1990|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/section/3|website=legislation.gov.uk — The National Archives, of UK|date=10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 2013, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] [[We the People (petitioning system)|posted a petition]] on the [[whitehouse.gov]] site asking that DDoS be recognized as a legal form of protest similar to the [[Occupy movement|Occupy protests]], the claim being that the similarity in purpose of both are same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/12/anonymous-ddos-petition-white-house_n_2463009.html |title=Anonymous DDoS Petition: Group Calls On White House To Recognize Distributed Denial Of Service As Protest. |publisher=HuffingtonPost.com |date=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59AlNnX_Ksg "DDOS Attack: crime or virtual sit-in?"].

== Etymology ==
Christopher Cannon, in ''The Making of Chaucer's English'', gives a complete detailed work on the [[etymology]] of Chaucer's special manuscript words and references the [[Middle English Dictionary]] (''MED'') definitions and etymology of each of these words.&lt;ref name=cannon224_460&gt;Cannon, 224-460&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that the ''MED'' does not give details on the etymology of many of Chaucer's derived words, including many compounds, some participial [[adjective]]s, and most [[gerunds]].&lt;ref name=cannon224_460/&gt; Cannon also points out that, while the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] lists Chaucer as the ''first cited author'' of these words, it also is mostly silent on the etymologies of these particular derived words.&lt;ref name=cannon224_460/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;Simpson, Weiner, et al, ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. According to the Library of Congress for those that have academic library subscribing to the OED, here are the steps you can use to find such a list of words:
* Once you are in the OED Online, select "Simple Search" found at the bottom of the screen.
* Enter the word Chaucer in the box on the upper left of the screen where it says Search for
* For the next box below labeled "in," use the pull-down arrow and click on "first cited author."
* Most Universities and Colleges and many large public libraries have OED Online where the reference librarian can give you a listing.
* The listing output shows Chaucer's works where he is cited as the first cited author of these words and the year the work was published.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon furnishes a complete list of Chaucer's special manuscript words with their etymology.&lt;ref name=cannon224_460/&gt;

Historian Albert Baugh points out that some of Chaucer's [[aureate]] words came from Latin or French origin.&lt;ref&gt;Baugh, pp. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Chaucer's aureate words like ''[[:wikt:laureate|laureate]], [[:wikt:mediation|mediation]],'' and ''[[:wikt:oriental|oriental]]'' eventually became a part of everyday English. Baugh points out that the innovations of word development into common speech and everyday usage, such as these Chaucer words, is of considerable interest in the history of style.&lt;ref&gt;Baugh, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

== List ==
Below is a complete list of the 1977 Chaucer's special manuscript words that are first found in the existing manuscripts below as listed in the Oxford English Dictionary as being the ''first cited author.''&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; Some now have different spellings and others are given the "root" word definition.&lt;ref name=cannon224_460/&gt; Some of these words are now dated or obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; These manuscript words first found written in Chaucer's work, from ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' and other of his publications as shown below, were published in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=cannon224_460/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

===''The Canterbury Tales''===
''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is a collection of tales written sometime after 1373, with 'sondry folk' that resemble [[Boccaccio]]'s stories of ''[[The Decameron]]'' of fleeing nobles.

==== General Prologue ====
The ''[[General Prologue]]'' introduces the tellers of the tales, with much wry and subtle social commentary.

'' [[:wikt:cater|acate]], [[:wikt:affile|affile]], [[:wikt:alight|alight]], [[:wikt:ambler|ambler]], [[:wikt:army|army]], [[:wikt:arrive|arrive]], [[:wikt:bagpipe|bagpipe]], [[:wikt:begging|begster]], [[:wikt:borax|borax]], [[:wikt:bourdon|bourdon]], [[:wikt:bracer|bracer]], [[:wikt:bream|bream]], [[:wikt:cape|cape]], [[:wikt:ceruse|ceruse]], [[:wikt:chape|chape]], [[:wikt:clasp|clasp]], [[:wikt:cordial|cordial]], [[:wikt:dagger|dagger]], [[:wikt:debt|debtless]], [[:wikt:digestible|digestible]], [[:wikt:dormant|dormant]], [[:wikt:Flanders|Flandrish]], [[:wikt:Footstool|foot-mantle]], [[:wikt:foster|foster]], [[:wikt:gaud|gaud]], [[:wikt:hostelry|hostelry]], [[:wikt:householder|householder]], [[:wikt:in|in]], [[:wikt:jingle|jingle]], [[:wikt:knob|knob]], [[:wikt:licentiate|licentiate]], [[:wikt:line|line]], [[:wikt:luce|luce]], [[:wikt:magic|magic]], [[:wikt:magician|magician]], [[:wikt:Bone marrow|marrowbone]], [[:wikt:mercenary|mercenary]], [[:wikt:miscarry|miscarry]], [[:wikt:moral|moral]], [[:wikt:pardoner|pardoner]], [[:wikt:parvis|parvis]], [[:wikt:patent|patent]], [[:wikt:perse|perse]], [[:wikt:session|session]], [[:wikt:significavit|significavit]], [[:wikt:stew|stew]], [[:wikt:wallet|wallet]], [[:wikt:whistling|whistling]] ''

==== The Knight's Tale ====
''[[The Knight's Tale]]'' introduces many typical aspects of [[knighthood]] such as [[courtly love]] and moral issues.

''[[:wikt:alan|alan]], [[:wikt:attorney|attourne]], [[:wikt:breastplate|breastplate]], [[:wikt:brother|broid]], [[:wikt:buckle|buckle]], [[:wikt:cereal|cerrial]], [[:wikt:chaas|chaas]], [[:wikt:Circe|Circe]], [[:wikt:citrine|citrine]], [[:wikt:coagulation|clottered]], [[:wikt:collared|collared]], [[:wikt:execute|execute]], [[:wikt:expel|expel]], [[:wikt:explosive material|expulsive]], [[:wikt:femininity|feminie]], [[:wikt:flutterbird|fluttery]], [[:wikt:funeral|funeral]], [[:wikt:gigging|gigge]], [[:wikt:holm|holm]], [[:wikt:howl|howl]], [[:wikt:huntress|huntress]], [[:wikt:intellect|intellect]], [[:wikt:kemp|kemp]], [[:wikt:lacing|lacing]], [[:wikt:laxative|laxative]], [[:wikt:Lucina|Lucina]], [[:wikt:melancholic|melancholic]], [[:wikt:menacing|menacing]], [[:wikt:accident|mishap]], [[:wikt:mortal|mortal]], [[:wikt:mover|mover]], [[:wikt:murmur|murmur]], [[:wikt:murmuring|murmuring]], [[:wikt:muzzle|muzzle]], [[:wikt:naker|naker]], [[:wikt:narcotic|narcotic]], [[:wikt:nymph|nymph]], [[:wikt:obsequy|obsequy]], [[:wikt:obstacle|obstacle]], [[:wikt:opie|opie]], [[:wikt:opposite|opposite]], [[:wikt:oyez|oyez]], [[:wikt:parament|parament]], [[:wikt:party|party]], [[:wikt:perturb|perturb]], [[:wikt:pharmacy|pharmacy]], [[:wikt:plain|plain]], [[:wikt:portraiture|portraiture]], [[:wikt:possibility|possibility]], [[:wikt:princess|princess]], [[:wikt:progression|progression]], [[:wikt:refuge|refuge]], [[:wikt:renting|renting]], [[:wikt:returning|returning]], [[:wikt:save|save]], [[:wikt:saving|saving]], [[:wikt:serie|serie]], [[:wikt:shouting|shouting]], [[:wikt:smiler|smiler]], [[:wikt:strangle|strangle]], [[:wikt:strangling|strangling]], [[:wikt:tester|tester]], [[:wikt:thoroughfare|thoroughfare]], [[:wikt:turret|turret]], [[:wikt:vanishing|vanishing]], [[:wikt:variation|variation]], [[:wikt:vital|vital]], [[:wikt:vomit|vomit]], [[:wikt:whippletree|whippletree]], [[:wikt:winged|winged]]''

==== The Miller's Tale ====
[[The Miller's Tale]] is told by a drunken miller to "quite" (requite) [[The Knight's Tale]]. The word "quite" here means to make repayment for a service - telling stories.

==== The Reeve's Tale ====
[[The Reeve's Tale]] is about two clerks tricking a miller. This tale is possibly based on Boccaccio's sixth story in ''The Decameron.''

'' [[:wikt:bodkin|bodkin]], [[:wikt:bolt|bolt]], [[:wikt:chime|chime]], [[:wikt:derere|derere]], [[:wikt:easement|easement]], [[:wikt:Grazing|grass time]], [[:wikt:halfway|halfway]], [[:wikt:jossa|jossa]], [[:wikt:messuage|messuage]], [[:wikt:mullock|mullock]], [[:wikt:popper|popper]], [[:wikt:quack|quack]], [[:wikt:sack|sack]], [[:wikt:Sheffield|Sheffield]], [[:wikt:thick and thin|thick and thin]], [[:wikt:varnish|varnish]] ''

==== The Cook's Tale ====
[[File:Wife-of-Bath-ms.jpg|thumb|From the first page of Canterbury Tales: ''''' The Wife of Bath's Tale '''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.librarius.com/canttran/wftltrfs.htm The Wife of Bath's Prologue]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[The Cook's Tale]] is a tale of an apprentice named Perkins who is fond of drinking and dancing. He ultimately is released from his master and moves in with a friend. This friend's wife is a prostitute. The story becomes more 'seedy', continuing the downward trend of the preceding tales.

This square is dedicated to the memory of [[Daniele Manin]], an Venetian patriot, who led Venetian resistance against [[Austrian Empire]] occupation in the mid-19th century.]]

'''Ettore Beggiato''' (born August 4, 1954), is an [[Italy|Italian]] historian and politician.&lt;ref name="Day2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Alan John|title=Directory of European Union political parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2WIAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=2000-03-15|publisher=John Harper|isbn=978-0-9536278-6-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As member of several Venetist political parties ([[Liga Veneta]] 1980–1987, [[Union of the Venetian People]] 1987–1995, [[Liga Veneta]]–[[Lega Nord]] 1995–1998, [[Liga Veneta Repubblica]]/[[Veneti d'Europa]]/[[Liga Fronte Veneto]] 1998–2004), he was member of the [[Regional Council of Veneto]] from 1985 to 2000. He was secretary of [[Liga Fronte Veneto]] from 2002 to 2004, when he joined the [[North-East Project]], party of which he is currently member.

Beggiato is the author of many books about the history and the culture of [[Veneto]] such as ''1866: The great swindle'', about the referendum with which [[Veneto]] was united with [[Italy]]. He demonstrated how it was not regular and not fairly democratic at all. For these reasons, Beggiato claims that [[Veneto]] is an independent nation and that it is necessary to re-celebrate it.

The '''foco''' theory of [[revolution]] by way of [[guerrilla warfare]], also known as '''focalism''' ({{wiktspa|foquismo}} {{IPA-es|foˈkismo|}}), was formulated by French intellectual and government official [[Régis Debray]], whose main source of inspiration was [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]]'s experiences surrounding his rebel army's victory in the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]].

Its central principle is that [[vanguardism]] by cadres of small, fast-moving [[paramilitary]] groups can provide a focus (in Spanish ''{{wiktspa|foco}}'') for popular discontent against a sitting regime and thereby lead a general [[insurrection]]. Although the original approach was to mobilize and launch attacks from rural areas, many foco ideas were adapted into [[urban guerrilla warfare]] movements by the late 1960s.

== Background ==
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar|Variants}}
Like other theorists of his era (such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[Amílcar Cabral]]), [[Che Guevara]] believed that people living in countries still ruled by [[colonialism|colonial powers]], or living in countries subject to [[Neo-colonialism|newer forms of economic exploitation]], could best defeat [[colonial power]]s by taking up arms. Guevara also believed in fostering armed resistance not by concentrating one's forces in urban centers, but rather through the accumulation of strength in mountainous and rural regions where the enemy had less presence.&lt;ref name="SLG"&gt;
[http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/02/legacy-of-che-guevara-internationalism.html "The Legacy of Che Guevara: Internationalism Today"] by Dr. Peter Custers, ''Sri Lanka Guardian'', 24 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cuban Revolution ==
Focalism, which was formally theorized by Régis Debray, draws on Guevara's experience of the 1959 Cuban Revolution, where a small group of 82 members landed in Cuba on board of the ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' in December 1956 and initiated a guerrilla war in the [[Sierra Maestra]]. During two years, the poorly armed ''[[escopeteros]]'', at times fewer than 200 men, won victories against [[Fulgencio Batista]]'s army and police force, which numbered between 30,000 and 40,000 in strength.&lt;ref name = "Bockman2"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/BLJ.htm "Bockman"], chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The small group finally took [[Havana]] after the December 1958 [[Battle of Santa Clara]].

This surprising success led to the focalism theory which inspired by Mao Zedong's doctrine of [[people's war]] counted on the support of the people to win the war. However, the focalist theory stated that this popular support would be created during the [[armed struggle]] itself, therefore against the predominant [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]] there was no need to wait for the "objective conditions" of a popular uprising to engage the last stage of the revolutionary struggle (i.e. armed struggle). In other words, a small group of revolutionaries was considered to be enough to jumpstart a revolution since this group could begin the revolutionary struggle while at the same time developing the conditions necessary for popular support for the revolution. This theory focused heavily on the notion of [[vanguardism]] and on the moral value of the example.

== Theory ==
While focalism drew from previous [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideas and the [[Maoism|Maoist]] strategy of "[[protracted people's war]]", it also broke with many of the mid-[[Cold War]] era's established [[communist parties]]. Despite [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s eager support for "[[wars of national liberation]]" and the focalists' own enthusiasm for [[Soviet Union]] patronage, [[Cuba]]'s own [[Popular Socialist Party (Cuba)|Popular Socialist Party]] had retreated from active confrontation with the [[Fulgencio Batista]] regime and [[Castroism]]/[[Guevarism]] substituted the focalist [[militia]] for the more traditional [[vanguard party]].

In ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (book)|Guerrilla Warfare]]'' (''La Guerra de Guerrillas''), Guevara did not count on a [[Leninism|Leninist]] insurrection led by the [[proletariat]] as had happened during the 1917 [[October Revolution]], but on popular uprisings which would gain strength in rural areas and would overthrow the regime. The vanguard guerrilla was supposed to bolster the population's morale, not to take control of the [[State (polity)|state apparatus]] itself and this overthrow would occur without any external or foreign help. According to him, guerrillas were to be supported by [[conventional warfare|conventional armed forces]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is well established that guerrilla warfare constitutes one of the phases of war; this phase can not, on its own, lead to victory.&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Che Guevara French ed.: ''Oeuvres'' I, ''Petite collection [[François Maspero|Maspero]]'', 34, 1968, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Guevara added that this theory was formulated for [[developing countries]] and that the guerrilleros had to look for support among both the workers and the [[peasant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1963/misc/guerrilla-war-method.htm Guevara, Che. "Guerrilla War: A Method."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In power, Castro sided with the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1961 [[Sino-Soviet split]] while Guevara sympathized with [[China]]. Perhaps accelerated by this divide, the latter man shifted his energies away from Cuba to adventurism, promoting guerrilla focalism overseas. Though this method had triumphed in Cuba, Guevara saw it subsequently fail in Africa and Latin America. [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] put it in practice in [[Congo Crisis|Congo]]. Despite being backed by the Castro regime, Guevara's attempt to forge an [[Ñancahuazú Guerrilla|insurgency]] in [[History of Bolivia|Bolivia]] led to his capture and subsequent execution in 1967.

== After Guevara ==
Guevara's unsuccessful campaign in Bolivia dampened Cuba's overt support of focoist uprisings internationally for several years and many revolutionary movements split into different factions, particularly [[New Left]], [[Maoism|Maoist]] and/or urban guerrilla breakaways from previous Moscow-line parties and/or ''foco'' groups. By the mid-1970s, Cuba revived and further escalated its previous zeal, directly deploying its military in Africa before the collapse of [[détente]]—e.g. supporting up the [[MPLA]] government in [[Angolan Civil War|Angola]].

== Argentina's People's Revolutionary Army ==
In [[History of Argentina|Argentina]], the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP), led by Roberto Santucho, attempted to create a ''foco'' in the [[Tucumán Province]]. The attempt failed after the government of [[Isabel Perón]] signed in February 1975 the secret presidential decree 261, which ordered the army to neutralize and/or annihilate the ERP insurgency (which was not supported by a foreign power and also lacked popular support). [[Operativo Independencia]] gave power to the [[Argentine Armed Forces]] to "execute all military operations necessary for the effects of neutralizing or annihilating the action of subversive elements acting in the Province of Tucumán".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuncamas.org/document/decreto_261_75.htm Decree No. 261/75] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115180714/http://www.nuncamas.org/document/decreto_261_75.htm|date=15 November 2006}}. NuncaMas.org, ''Decretos de aniquilamiento''.&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Acdel Vilas]] immediately deployed over 3,000 soldiers, including conscripts from the Fifth Infantry Brigade and two companies of elite commandos. While fighting the guerrillas in the jungle, Vilas concentrated on uprooting the ERP support network in the towns, using [[State terrorism|state terror]] tactics, inspired by the 1961 [[Battle of Algiers (1957)|Battle of Algiers]], later adopted nationwide as well as a civic action campaign. The ERP was quickly defeated, but this military campaign marked the beginning of the [[Dirty War]] in Argentina.

== Central America ==
After victories for a once-divided, recently reunited [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] movement in [[History of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] and the [[united front]]-style [[New Jewel Movement]] in [[History of Grenada|Grenada]] in 1979, Castro effectively supported the creation of the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] of [[History of El Salvador|El Salvador]] by pushing for the merge of five other communist factions between December 1979 and October 1980. Similarly, Cuba supported four rival guerrilla groups' decision to form the [[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity]] coalition of [[History of Guatemala|Guatemala]] in 1982.{{citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In 744 [[Saint Sturm]], a disciple of [[Saint Boniface]], founded the [[Benedictine]] [[monastery of Fulda]] as one of Boniface's outposts in the reorganization of the church in [[Carolingian Empire|Germany]]. It later served as a base from which missionaries could accompany [[Charles the Great|Charlemagne]]'s armies in their political and military [[Saxon Wars|campaigns]] to fully conquer and convert pagan [[Old Saxony|Saxony]].

The initial grant for the abbey was signed by [[Carloman (mayor of the palace)|Carloman]], [[Mayor of the Palace]] in [[Austrasia]] (in office 741–47), the son of [[Charles Martel]]. The support of the Mayors of the Palace, and later of the early Pippinid and [[Carolingian]] rulers, was important to Boniface's success. Fulda also received support from many of the leading families of the Carolingian world. Sturm, whose tenure as abbot lasted from 747 until 779, was most likely related to the Agilolfing dukes of [[Bavaria]]. 

Fulda also received large and constant donations from the Etichonids, a leading family in [[Alsace]], and from the [[Conradines]], predecessors of the [[Salian]] [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. Under Sturm, the donations Fulda received from these and other important families helped in the establishment of daughter-houses near Fulda.

{{nowrap|After his martyrdom}} by the [[Frisians|Frisian]]s, the relics of Saint Boniface were brought back to Fulda. Because of the stature this afforded the monastery, the donations increased, and Fulda could establish daughter-houses further away, for example in [[Hamelin]]. Meanwhile, Saint [[Lullus]], successor of Boniface as [[archbishop of Mainz]], tried to absorb the abbey into his archbishopric, but failed. This was one reason that he founded [[Hersfeld Abbey]] — to limit the attempts of the enlargement of Fulda.

Between 790 and 819 the community rebuilt the main [[monastery]] church to more fittingly house the [[relic]]s. They based their new [[basilica]] on the original [[4th-century]] (since demolished) [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, using the [[transept]] and [[crypt]] plan of that great [[pilgrimage]] church to frame their own saint as the "Apostle to the Germans". 

The crypt of the original [[abbey]] church still holds those relics, but the church itself has been subsumed into a [[Baroque]] renovation. A small, [[9th-century]] chapel remains standing within walking distance of the church, as do the foundations of a later women's abbey. [[Rabanus Maurus]] served as abbot at Fulda from 822 to 842.

===Counter-Reformation===
Prince-abbot [[Balthasar von Dernbach]] adopted a policy of [[counterreformation]]. In 1571 he called in the [[Jesuits]] to found a school and college. He insisted that the members of the chapter should return to a [[Monasticism|monastic]] form of life. Whereas his predecessors had tolerated [[Protestantism]], resulting in most of the citizenry of Fulda and a large portion of the principality's countryside professing [[Lutheranism]], Balthasar ordered his subjects either to return to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic faith]] or leave his territories.&lt;ref name="counterreform1"&gt;Otto Schaffrath. ''Fürstabt Balthasar von Dermbach und seine Zeit. Studien zur Geschichte der Gegenreformation in Fulda'' (= ''Veröffentlichung des Fuldaer Geschichtsvereins''. Bd. 44, {{ZDB|517272-x}}). Parzeller, Fulda 1967, mit umfangreicher Literaturübersicht.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th and 19th centuries===
The foundation of the abbey Fulda and its territory originated with an Imperial grant, and the sovereign [[principality]] therefore was subject only to the [[List of German monarchs|German emperor]]. Fulda became a bishopric in 1752 and the [[prince-abbot]]s were given the additional title of [[prince-bishop]]. The prince-abbots (and later prince-bishops) ruled Fulda and the surrounding region until the [[bishopric]] was forcibly dissolved by [[Napoleon I]] in 1802.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The city went through a baroque building campaign in the 18th century, resulting in the current “Baroque City” status. This included a remodeling of [[Fulda Cathedral]] (1704–12) and of the ''Stadtschloss ''(Fulda Castle-Palace, 1707–12) by [[Johann Dientzenhofer]]. The city parish church, St. Blasius, was built between 1771–85.  In 1764 a [[porcelain]] factory was started in Fulda under Prince-Bishop, Prince-Abbot [[Heinrich von Bibra]], but shortly after his death it was closed down in 1789 by his successor, Prince-Bishop, Prince-Abbot Adalbert von Harstall.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The city was given to [[William I of the Netherlands|Prince William Frederick of Orange-Nassau]] (the later King [[William I of the Netherlands]]) in 1803 (as part of the short-lived [[Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda]]), was annexed to the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]] in 1806, and in 1809 to the [[Principality of Frankfurt]]. After the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814–15, most of the territory went to the [[Electorate of Hesse]], which [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] annexed in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{AmCyc|wstitle=Fulda|inline=1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War===
Fulda lends its name to the [[Fulda Gap]], a traditional east-west invasion route used by Napoleon I and others. During the [[Cold War]], it was presumed to be an invasion route for any conventional war between [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)|NATO]] and [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet forces]]. Downs Barracks in Fulda was the headquarters of the American [[14th Armored Cavalry Regiment]], later replaced by the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]]. The cavalry had as many as 3,000 soldiers from the end of [[World War II]] until 1993. Not all of those soldiers were in Fulda proper, but scattered over observation posts and in the cities of [[Bad Kissingen]] and [[Bad Hersfeld]]. The strategic importance of this region (along the old West/East German border) led to a large [[United States Army|United States]]– and Soviet military presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the U.S. Army|editor1-first=Jerold E.|editor1-last=Brown|year=2001 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, CT|isbn=9780313293221|pages=209–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygqNt3ra-vYC&amp;pg=PA209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
[[Fulda station]] is a transport hub and interchange point between local and long distance traffic of the [[Rail transport in Germany|German railway network]], and is classified by [[Deutsche Bahn]] as a [[German railway station categories|category 2 station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DBCatsURL}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the [[Hanover–Würzburg high-speed railway]]; the [[North–South railway|North-South line]] (''Nord-Süd-Strecke''), comprising the [[Bebra–Fulda railway|Bebra-Fulda line]] north of Fulda, and the [[Kinzig Valley Railway (Hesse)|Kinzig Valley Railway]] and [[Fulda-Main Railway]] to the south; the [[Vogelsberg Railway]], which connects to the hills of the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]] in the west; and the [[Fulda–Gersfeld Railway]] (Rhön Railway) to [[Gersfeld]] in the [[Rhön Mountains]] to the east.

Fulda is on the [[Bundesautobahn 7]] (BAB 7). [[Bundesautobahn 66]] starts at the interchange with the BAB 7, heading south towards [[Frankfurt]]. Fulda is also on the [[Bundesstraße 27]].

'''George Collingridge''' (1847–1931) was an [[Australia]]n writer and illustrator best known today for his early assertions of [[Portuguese discovery of Australia]] in the 16th century.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]], educated in [[Paris]] (in the [[15th arrondissement]]), served in the [[Papal Zouaves]] (alongside his brother Alfred, who died in the [[Battle of Mentana]]), and migrated to Australia in 1879 aboard the ''Lusitania'' (not the [[RMS Lusitania|ship of the same name]] that sank in 1915).  He settled in the then isolated area of [[Berowra, New South Wales|Berowra]], before moving to nearby [[Hornsby, New South Wales]]. 

==Career==
Since his French academic qualifications as a "Professeur" were not recognised by Australian universities, he worked as an artist and art teacher, and contributed drawings and articles to local newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Mitchell, Adrian | author2=Collingridge, George, 1847-1931, (artist.) | title=Plein airs and graces : the life and times of George Collingridge | publication-date=2012 | publisher=Wakefield Press | isbn=978-1-74305-095-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He founded the first Australian art magazine, [[Australian Art: a Monthly Magazine &amp; Journal]], and was one of the founders of the [[Royal Art Society of New South Wales]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=Adrian |title=George Collingridge and the Antipathies |journal=Journal of the Australasian Universities Language and Literature Association |date=18 July 2013 |volume=2008 |issue=110 |pages=39–52 |doi=10.1179/000127908805259716}} &lt;/ref&gt;.

His publication of ''The Discovery of Australia'' in 1895 earned him accolade as a "genius" and as "an authority on geographical matters" from members of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] as well as foreign honours: in 1908 he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of Santiago by the King of [[Portugal]].  In 1917 he was made  a Knight Commander of the Order of Isabella la Catolica by the King of [[Spain]].  However, not everyone was as complimentary; his official biographer, O.H.K. Spate, described him as of "undisciplined intellect" and lacking a "rigorously judicial habit of mind"; the book was a financial failure; and a proposed scheme to use a simplified version of the book, ''The First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea'' (1906), in schools was withdrawn.

Collingridge published "Alice in One Dear Land" in 1922. It is a handmade book with numerous small tipped in plates. Alice is depicted in the Australian bush with a koala, this is the first depiction of "[[Alice in Wonderland]]" in an Australian setting.

Collingridge's distant relative, [[Vanessa Collingridge]], published a book on [[James Cook|Captain Cook]], entitled ''Captain Cook'' (2002), and the publication of this book has caused a certain resurgence of interest in George Collingridge in recent years.

==Early dynasties and the Silk Road==
[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Silk Road extending from southern Europe through Arabia, Somalia, Egypt, Persia, India and Java until it reaches China.]]

The first historical instance of China engaging in internationalism was during the [[Han Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Killion"&gt;Killion, U. (2006) A modern Chinese journey to the west. New York: [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]]&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the Han Dynasty, the [[Huns]] in the north were attacking the frontiers of Han and trying to obtain riches. [[Emperor Wu of Han]] wanted to gain an alliance with a country called Dayuezhi so the two countries could join together and fight against the Huns.&lt;ref name="Wild"&gt;Wild, O. (1992). The Silk road. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.ess.uci.edu/~oliver/silk.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160315145417/http://www.ess.uci.edu/~oliver/silk.html |archivedate=2016-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain this alliance, Emperor Wu sent [[Zhang Qian]] to the West to establish economic and cultural connections.&lt;ref name="Wild"/&gt; History records that during the Han Dynasty there were four primary avenues of contact between China and Europe. They included the northern land route, the central land route, the southern sea route, and the far southern sea route.&lt;ref name="Killion"/&gt; The most famous of these routes is the central land route, or the classical [[Silk Road]], comprising a network of roads stretching from northwest China to the ports of Syria and the Black Sea, which passed through the oasis of the Turkestans and Northern Persia.&lt;ref name="Killion"/&gt; The Silk Road was significant for Chinese emperors because it provided dominance over Central Asia by developing resources and provided new markets for the export of China's most valuable resources.&lt;ref name="Killion"/&gt;

During the [[Tang Dynasty]] there was a new age of urbanization and increased maritime commerce.&lt;ref name="Killion"/&gt; For instance, [[Changan]], the capital of the Dynasty, developed into one of the largest cities during that time.&lt;ref name="Wild"/&gt; By 742 CE, the population had reached almost 2 million and census showed that 5,000 foreigners lived in the city: Turks, Iranians, Indians, and others from along the road.&lt;ref name="Wild"/&gt; Trade continued to flourish during this period and brought an increased number of foreigners, foreign religions, and foreign ideas in China.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The [[Song Dynasty]] transformed the focus of the Silk Road from the reliance on domestic trade to a reliance on Pacific Orientation. Trade was now supported by a large merchant marine and defended by an imperial navy and long distance routes to the Middle East, India and the coast of Africa were now more readily available.&lt;ref name= "Veeck"&gt;G. Veeck, C. Pannell, C. Smith and Y. Huang. China’s Geography: Rowman and Littlefield, Lanham MD, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the government started to heavily regulate foreign trade due to military threats on the Northern border.&lt;ref name="Killion"/&gt; In order to monitor the flow of commodities in international trade, the Bureau of Merchant Shipping was established to tax merchant ships passing through.&lt;ref name="Killion"/&gt; In addition, international trade became less focused on cultural exchanges and instead was seen as a necessity for the growth of the Chinese economy.&lt;ref name="Killion"/&gt;

== Modern China ==

=== 20th Century China ===
China's efforts to balance the economic and socio-political tasks of education in its modern nation-building can be traced back to the struggles of the late [[Qing dynasty]], under threat of foreign aggression for modernization and national survival. This dilemma has persisted through the establishment of the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (1912–49)]] and the [[China|People's Republic of China]], and onto that of the successors and into modern day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Globalization, National Identity, and Citizenship Education: China's Search for Modernization and a Modern Chinese Citizenry.|last = Law|first = Globalization, National Identity, and Citizenship Education: China's Search for Modernization and a Modern Chinese Citizenry.|date = 2013|journal = Frontiers of Education in China|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older societies have had to overhaul their institutions and world views radically in order to conform with the models of the modern [[nation state]] system, with post-1949 China being the time that this reordering took place within China. After the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], the Chinese government instituted a number of reforms that were meant to increase economic growth while at the same time stifling the proliferation of democratic sentiments in their country. To the CCP (or the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]]), Democracy leads to political instability which in turn impedes economic development and this is a sentiment believed by many people inside China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = History and Globalization in China's Long Twentieth Century|last = Duara|first = Prasenjit|date = 2008|journal = Modern China|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 China's population was the largest in the world but its GDP was only ninth in the world, yet twenty-five years later China's economy has become the second largest after only the U.S. This major increase in economic development was not without a cost because although economic reform and globalization had brought China unprecedented wealth it also brought China a monstrous increase in carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China's 1989 Choice: the Paradox of Seeking Wealth and Democracy|url = http://wilsonquarterly.com/stories/chinas-1989-choice-paradox-seeking-wealth-and-democracy/|website = wilsonquarterly.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09|last = O'Mahoney|first = Joseph|authorlink = |last2 = Wang|first2 = Zheng|date = Fall 2014|publisher = Wilson Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st Century China ===
Since 2005, China has spent more than $56 billion in sub-Saharan Africa, with significant investment in oil, platinum, copper, nickel, and manganese as well as other extracting industries. China's bilateral trade with African countries rose from $10 billion in 2000 to $125 billion in 2010 and stands to reach $300 billion by 2015, surpassing the United States as Africa's largest trading partner. China's trade with Latin America has also increased dramatically, rising to 1,500% between 2000 and 2010 through loans and direct foreign investment. China is one of the primary winners of the Western sanctions against Iran, as it has allowed them to become its top trading partner, purchasing 400,000 barrels of oil per day all paid for with the yuan in an attempt to elevate the global standing of the yuan against the U.S. dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China: Empire Building in the Age of Globalization - The Globalist|url = http://www.theglobalist.com/china-empire-building-in-the-age-of-globalization/|website = The Globalist|accessdate = 2015-12-09|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese integration into the global financial system has taken its first steps by way of the launch of the "[[Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect]]" and "[[Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect]]". The implications that an increase in Chinese integration into the global financial system are many, with positives and negatives for both the Chinese and the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Globalisation 2.0' - the revolution that will change the world|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/11244131/Globalisation-2.0-could-answer-our-prayers.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hong Kong]] there have been a number of political battles due to a feeling that with the increase of globalization came an increase of "Chinaization". Expanding global commerce and the corporate control of the political process weakens the autonomy and power of local communities, which is what [[Jihad vs. McWorld]] argues. The more integrated communities become with mainland China, the more prosperity they receive, but most of the advantages go to the various business tycoons and corporate elites, which can be seen as an example of the rise in income inequality in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China’s New Identity Crisis|url = http://time.com/3449551/chinas-new-identity-crisis/|website = TIME.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09|first = Zheng|last = Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic Shifts ==
Since 1980, China has undergone a series of reform policies aimed at transforming its economic system from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy by combining the planning economic systems from socialism with a market mechanism from capitalism. This was spearheaded by [[Deng Xiaoping]] who set out to create a more economically open China, with the results of this new liberalization and globalization of the economy being substantial. During the period of 1978 to 2012, China's GDP grew about 9.8% annually and its GDP volume increased 22.5 times during this period, while its GDP per capita grew at an annual rate of 8.5% and increased 15 times in the same period. By 2010, China surpassed [[Japan]] to become the world's second-largest economy and at the same time it also surpassed [[Germany]] in terms of export volume, becoming the largest in the world. The massive increase of GDP in China has led to an increase of living standards for the Chinese since their incomes have doubled or even quadrupled every 10 years. Amid this economic outburst, the income distribution in China has increased dramatically, changing China from a relatively equal socialist country to a very unequal country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Globalization, Liberalization and Income Inequality: The Case of China|last = Xue|first = JinJun|date = 2014|journal = Singapore Economic Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |first2 = Luo|last2 = Chuliang|first3 = Li|last3 = Shi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[economic globalization]] of China has transformed the nature of its national policy preferences, calling into question for the rest of the world what their true intentions might very well be. The efforts to increase the liberalization of the Chinese economy, spearheaded by the U.S., were met with mixed feelings due to China's rapid economic progress.The bittersweet nature of China's rise in economic power leads to questions about whether or not it will support the existing international order of things or challenge it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = China: Globalization and the Emergence of a New Status Quo Power?|last = Liang|first = Wei|date = 2007|journal = Asian Perspectives|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The undervalued [[Chinese yuan]] with respect to the [[U.S. dollar|United States dollar]] has brought about questions to whether or not a move to a more flexible exchange rate would be beneficial to the Chinese economy, with most experts arguing that no dramatic change in exchange rate is needed and that the most needed policy attention is the domestic financial sector, not the international.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Review of Economic Growth, Transition and Globalization in China|last = Bowles|first = Paul|date = 2007|journal = The China Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Shifts ==
The Chinese desire for globalization is countered by the fear of losing their own culture, identity, and history, meaning that the suspicions towards the English language seeping into Chinese (and worldwide) cultures might be justified, if even to a small degree. [[English language|English]] has been seen as a new form of [[opium]] to some which indicates a growing hostility towards English in China but at the same time raises questions due to English being the predominate language for international trade and communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Reviewed Work: English and Globalization: Perspectives from Hong Kong and Mainland China|last = Zhao|first = Yong|date = 2007|journal = Language in Society|doi = 10.1017/s0047404507230131|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

China faces an unprecedented multitude of problems with regard to language choice and linguistic identity, some of which are due to challenges imposed by global English from the outside world. Although English was denounced as a language for the [[Bourgeois]]ie and imperialist during the [[Cultural Revolution]], it is viewed as a necessary tool in China's modernization and integration with the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chinese Under Globalization : Emerging Trends in Language Use in China|last = Jin|first = Liu|publisher = World Scientific Publishing Company|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Singapore|pages = 204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s municipal planners in a major [[port city|Port]] of China, [[Dalian]], sought to make the city a regional hub for trade, finance, and tourism, attempting to make the city a "Hong Kong of the North".

'''Henri-Raymond Casgrain''' (December 16, 1831 &amp;ndash; February 11, 1904) was a [[French Canadian]] [[Roman Catholic]] priest, author, publisher, and professor of history.

==Life==

Born in [[Rivière-Ouelle, Quebec|Rivière-Ouelle]], [[Lower Canada]], the son [[Charles-Eusèbe Casgrain]] and Eliza Anne Baby, Casgrain studied at College of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière. In 1852, he enrolled in the Montreal School of Medicine and Surgery, but became a priest in 1856. He started teaching at the College of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière until he was forced to give up teaching because of ill health. In 1859, he was appointed curate of the parish of La Nativité-de-Notre-Dame at Beauport and was free to devote himself entirely to literary pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{DictCanbio|ID=6619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, he was awarded a doctorate of history from the [[Universite Laval]], where he would remain as professor.

He wrote primarily on [[New France]] and its personalities, such as [[Samuel de Champlain]], [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] and his aide-de-camp [[Francis de Gaston, Chevalier de Levis]].

From 1889 to 1890, he was the president of the [[Royal Society of Canada]].

[[File:Maruru by Paul Gauguin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|"Mararu": Offerings of gratitude to Tahitian goddess Hina.&lt;br&gt;Woodcut by [[Paul Gauguin]] (1894).]]
'''Hina''' is the Eastern [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] variant for the given name Sina.  Hina/Sina is the name assigned to a number of Polynesian [[goddesses]] and queens.

==New Zealand==
Among the [[Iwi]] of New Zealand, Hina is usually considered to be either the elder sister or the wife of [[Māui (mythology)|Maui]]. 

The most common story that presents Hina as the wife of Maui tells of Te Tunaroa, the father of all [[eel]]s, who one day visited the pool where Hina bathed. One day, as Hina was bathing, the eel-god rubbed against her. This occurred over a number of visits until Te Tunaroa grew bold enough to rub against Hina's genitals, molesting her.

When Maui heard of this act he went and attacked Te Tunaroa cutting his body into bits, the tail landed in the sea and became the [[conger eel]], whereas the other end landed in the swamps as the fresh water eels. Smaller pieces became lamprey and hagfish.

A number of stories are told about Hina as the elder sister of Maui. Some iwi say that it was Hina who taught Maui to plait the ropes needed to capture the sun, using a strand of her own sacred hair to give the ropes supernatural strength. This legend recognizes important ritual status that elder sisters held  in traditional Maori society.

Hina was associated with phases of the moon under the names Hinatea (Fair Hina) and Hinauri (Dark Hina). The moon is also known by the name Mahina. Initially Hinatea (Fair Hina) was married to a man named Irawaru. During a fishing trip Irawaru antagonized Maui who had failed to catch any large fish. In revenge Maui assaulted Irawaru when they returned to shore, pushing his brother-in-law under the keel of their boat, breaking his back and other bones. Irawaru was turned into a dog (kuri) one breed of which was known as Irawaru.

When Hina heard what Maui had done she threw herself into the sea, but did not die and was instead carried across the waves to Motutapu (Sacred Isle). Her name was changed to Hinauri (Dark Hina) due to her darker mood. Eventually Hinauri would be welcomed by the people of Motutapu and was taken to the house of chief [[Tinirau]] god of fishes, becoming his new wife.  The existing wives were jealous and tried to assault Hinauri, but using her supernatural power Hinauri killed the other wives of Tinirau and so become the senior wife. (Biggs 1966:450). 

Hina was the mother of Tuhuruhuru, for whom the ritual intiation ritual was performed by the tohunga (priest) Kae. After this is done, Tinirau lends Kae his pet whale to take him home. In spite of strict instructions to the contrary, Kae forces the whale, Tutunui, into shallow water, where it becomes stranded and is killed, roasted and eaten by Kae and his people. When he learns of this Tinirau is furious and sends Hinauri with a party of women (often they are Tinirau's sisters) to capture Kae. The sisters perform indecent dances to make him laugh so they can see his crooked teeth. Then the women sing a magic song which puts Kae into a deep sleep, and carry him back to Motutapu. When Kae wakes from his sleep he is in Tinirau's house. Tinirau taunts him for his treachery, and kills him (Grey 1970:69, Tregear 1891:110, Biggs 1966:450).

==Mangaia==
A girl named Hina-moe-aitu ("Hina-sleeping-with-a-god") liked to bathe in a pool that housed many eels. One day, as Hina was bathing, one of the eels transformed into a young man. Hina took him as her lover. His name was Tuna.

After they had been together for a while, one day [[Tuna (Polynesian mythology)|Tuna]] told Hina that there would be a great downpour the next day. He would be washed up onto the threshold of her house in his eel-form. When that happened, Tuna said, Hina must cut off his head and bury it, and then regularly visit the place where the head had been buried.

Hina obeyed Tuna, returning faithfully to watch the place where she had buried his head. After many days, she saw a shoot sprout from the spot. Another shoot appeared, and the two shoots grew into a pair of [[coconut]] trees—the first coconut trees known to man.

In [[Mangaia]]n tradition, the coconut's white flesh is called "Tuna’s brains", and it is said that one can see a face when one looks at the shell of a coconut.&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, pp. 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuamotu and Tahiti==
For a time, the goddess Hina lived as the wife of Te Tuna, the god of eels. But she grew tired of him and decided to seek love elsewhere. Telling Tuna that she was going to get him some delicious food, Hina left him and went onto land.

Hina went from place to place, seeking a lover. But all the men she met were afraid to take Tuna’s wife, fearing the eel-god’s vengeance. Finally she met Maui, whose mother Taranga urged him to take the goddess as his wife.

When the people round about learned that Maui had taken Hina as his wife, they went to tell Tuna. At first, Tuna didn’t care, but the people annoyed him about it so much that he eventually vowed to win back his wife from Maui.

Along with four companions, Tuna rushed toward Maui’s home, carried by a huge wave. But Maui’s power turned back the wave and left Tuna and his companions beached on the reefs. Maui killed three of Tuna’s companions, while one escaped with a broken leg. Tuna himself Maui spared.

Tuna actually lived in peace in Maui’s home for some time. But one day, Tuna challenged Maui to a duel. Each would take a turn leaping into the others’ body and trying to kill him. If Tuna killed Maui, then Tuna would take his wife back. Tuna’s turn came first: he made himself small and entered Maui’s body. When he came back out, Maui was intact. Now it was Maui’s turn: Maui made himself small and entered Tuna’s body, tearing it apart. Maui cut off Tuna’s head and, at his mother’s suggestion, buried it in a corner of his house.

In time, a shoot sprouted from Tuna’s buried head and grew into a coconut tree. That was how humankind acquired coconuts.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 191-95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawaii==
[[File:Ku and Hina (1), photograph by Brother Bertram.jpg|thumb|Wooden carved ''[[tiki|kiʻi]]'' of Hina (right) and Kūkaʻilimoku (left)]]
In Hawaiian mythology, there are variations of the name Hina, including Hina-puku-iʻa (Hina-gathering-seafood) the goddess of fishermen, and Hina-ʻopu-hala-koʻa who gave birth to all reef life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hina: The Goddess|last=Varez|first=Dietrich|publisher=Petroglyph Press|year=2002|isbn=0-912180-59-5|location=Hilo, Hawaii|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stories about the goddess Hina, especially in connection with the moon, can be found in chapter 15 (“Hina Myths”) of Martha Beckwith’s ''Hawaiian Mythology''.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, pp. 214-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Hina is mostly described as a very attractive, smart, beautiful, determined young woman pursued by men and other creatures. Hina becomes tired of living in the crowd, flees to the moon, and eventually becomes goddess of it.

==Samoa==
In Samoa, the equivalent the name ''Sina'' referred to in many different stories in mythology. One example is the legend [[Sina and the Eel]] which is associated with the [[Mata o le Alelo]] pool on the island of [[Savai'i]].

== Easter Island (Rapa Nui) ==
In [[Rapa Nui mythology]], Hina takes the form of [[Hina-Oio]], a goddess of sea animals who was married to Atua-Metua. 

==Hina in literature==
[[Richard Adams]] wrote a poem retelling the [[Tahiti]]an story of Hina and Maui, published as a book, ''[[The Legend of Te Tuna]]''.

Also, in his popular book ''[[The Seven Daughters of Eve]]'', [[Bryan Sykes]] used Hina's name, (spelled therein "Ina") to denote the clan matriarch of [[mtDNA]] [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)|haplogroup B]].

==Hina in popular music==
[[David Lee Roth]] recorded a song called "Hina", contained on the hard rock album ''[[Skyscraper (album)|Skyscraper]]'', released in 1988.

Located principally in the [[Lima District|city centre]] or [[Lima District|Cercado de Lima]] and [[Rímac District|Rímac]] areas, the '''Historic Centre of Lima''' is among the most important tourist destinations in [[Peru]].

==Foundation==
[[File:Map of Lima highlighting Lima.PNG|thumb|right|Map of Lima]]
[[File:Lima1750.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the city of Lima with walls of 1750.]]

The city of Lima, the capital of Peru, was founded by [[Francisco Pizarro]] on 18 January 1535 and given the name '''City of the Kings'''. Nevertheless, with time its original name persisted, which may come from one of two sources: Either the Aymara language ''lima-limaq'' (meaning "yellow flower"), or the Spanish pronunciation of the [[Quechuan languages|Quechuan]] word ''rimaq'' (meaning "talker", and actually written and pronounced ''limaq'' in the nearby [[Quechua languages#Geographic distribution|Quechua I]] languages). It is worth noting that the same Quechuan word is also the source of the name given to the river that feeds the city, the [[Rímac River|Rimac river]] (pronounced as in the politically dominant [[Quechua languages#Geographic distribution|Quechua II]] languages, with an "r" instead of an "l"). Early maps of Peru show the two names displayed jointly.

In 1988, [[UNESCO]] declared the historic center of Lima a [[World Heritage Site]] for its originality and high concentration of historic monuments constructed in the time of Spanish presence.

==Balconies of Lima==
{{main|Balconies of Lima}}
[[File:Palacio de Torre Tagle.JPG|thumb|right|Facade of the Torre Tagle Palace]]
Of the structures in the historical center of Lima, situated are more than 1,600 {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} balconies that were built in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru|viceroyalty]] era as well as in the republic. In order to retain its conservation, the Municipality of Lima has invited individuals and companies to adopt a balcony in order to maintain them as if they were new. The abundance of these balconies adds to the particular harmony and originality to this part of the city.

==Colonial extravagance==
At the time of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], a work of art was created, a magnificence, a grandeur and a legendary royal life.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The authority of the [[viceroy]], like representative of the Spanish monarchy was particularly important, since its appointment supposed an important ascent and the successful culmination of a race in the colonial administration.

The entrances to [[Lima]] of the new viceroys were specially lavish. For the occasion, the streets were paved with silver bars from the doors of the city of Lima to the Palace of the Viceroy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Principal Monuments==
===Archbishop Palace===
{{main|Archbishop's Palace of Lima}}
[[Image:Limean Archbishop's Palace.jpg|thumb|The Archbishops palace. To the left, the House of the Oidor.]]
The Archbishop Palace is the home of the [[Archbishop of Lima]]. It is a popular tourist attraction in the [[Historical centre of Lima]], [[Peru]]. The first major church began construction in 1535. [[Pope Paul III]] turned it into an episcopal seat in 1541. In 1547, Lima was elevated to an archdiocese, which turned it by a short period, in the more extensive ecclesiastical circumscription of the world.
The patron of the episcopal seat is [[Saint Rosa of Lima]].

===Museum of Italian Art===
{{main|Museum of Italian Art}}
The Museum of Italian Art is the only '''European arts museum of Peru'''. It has a wide collection of paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and ceramics that belong to Italian artists from the beginnings of the 20th century, as well as a collection of 35 contemporary Italian paintings.

===House of Aliaga===
This house was constructed in 1535 on a pre-Columbian sanctuary.
It was constructed on the date, that is shared with that of the foundation of the city, it has been inhabited permanently by the descendants of the first proprietor, Jerónimo de Aliaga, standard-bearer and exchequer for Francisco Pizarro.

'''Hotpants''', '''hot pants''', or '''booty shorts''' describe extremely short [[shorts]], which may be worn by women and, to a lesser extent, by men. The term was first used by ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' in 1970 to describe shorts made in luxury fabrics such as velvet and satin for fashionable wear, rather than their more practical equivalents that had been worn for sports or leisure since the 1930s. The term has since become a generic term for any pair of extremely short shorts. While hotpants were briefly a very popular element of mainstream fashion in the early 1970s, by the mid-1970s they had become associated with the [[sex industry]], which contributed to their fall from fashion. However, hotpants continue to be popular as [[clubwear]] well into the 2010s, and are often worn within the entertainment industry, particularly as part of [[cheerleader]] costumes, or for dancers (especially [[backup dancer]]s). Performers such as [[Britney Spears]] and [[Kylie Minogue]] have famously worn hotpants as part of their public performances and presentation.

==Origins and terminology==
Whilst the term "hotpants" is used generically to describe extremely short shorts,&lt;ref name=50yrs&gt;{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=I.

According to the fashion publicist [[Eleanor Lambert]], the term "hot pants" was coined by ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' (''WWD'') in 1970 to describe fashions innovated by the French ready-to-wear company [[Dorothée Bis]].&lt;ref name=lambert&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lambert |first1=Eleanor |authorlink1=Eleanor Lambert |title=World of fashion: people, places, resources|date=1976|publisher=R.

While hotpants were principally marketed to women, men were also targeted, and the term can describe very short men's shorts.&lt;ref name=50yrs/&gt;&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;&lt;ref name=rio/&gt;&lt;ref name=girlculture&gt;{{cite book| first=Lynn| last=Peril| editor1-last=Mitchell |editor1-first=Claudia |editor2-last=Reid-Walsh|editor2-first=Jacqueline|title=Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313339097 |pages=362–3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&amp;pg=PA362 |language=en |chapter=Hot Pants| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 1960s, the fashion industry had tried unsuccessfully to promote the mid-calf-length or midi skirt as a fashionable replacement for the [[miniskirt]].&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;&lt;ref name=jet&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smaltz |first1=Audrey |title=HotPants, Or 'Knockout-Shorts', Worn By Sexy, Proud Women!|journal=Jet|date=25 March 1971 |pages=42–43 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the lukewarm response to the midi, shoppers enthusiastically embraced the idea of short shorts, which were made available at all price levels from haute couture to inexpensive ready-to-wear.&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; Lambert credits [[Mariuccia Mandelli]] of the Italian fashion label [[Krizia]] with designing the first "hot pants" in 1970.&lt;ref name=lambert/&gt; Hotpants are also increasingly credited to [[Mary Quant]], who reportedly offered them in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BYAXAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA220 |title=Historical Dictionary of the Fashion Industry|access-date=8 May 2017|publisher=Scarecrow Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Werlin |first1=Katy |editor1-last=Blanco F. |editor1-first=José |editor2-last=Hunt-Hurst |editor2-first=Patricia Kay |editor3-last=Lee |editor3-first=Heather Vaughan |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Doering |editor4-first=Mary |title=Clothing and Fashion: American Fashion from Head to Toe |date=2015 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781610693103 |page=160 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDkVCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA160 |chapter=Hot Pants}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamer |first1=Louise |last2=Blum |first2=Stella |editor1-last=Clark |editor1-first=Rowena|title=Fabulous Fashion 1907–67: Exhibition from the Costume Institute, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|date=1 January 1981|page=94 |publisher=International Cultural Corporation of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many designers from across the Western world produced their own versions of hotpants at all price levels, including [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Valentino (fashion designer)|Valentino]], [[Halston]], and [[Betsey Johnson]].&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; Mass-produced versions were also sold through the [[Sears]] mail-order catalogue.&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;

The [[James Brown]] song "[[Hot Pants (James Brown song)|Hot Pants (She Got to Use What She Got to Get What She Wants)]]", released in August 1971, was, according to his trombonist [[Fred Wesley]], inspired by the sight of women of all colours wearing hotpants in a wide range of materials in the Black and White Club, Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wesley |first1=Fred|title=Hit Me, Fred: Recollections of a Sideman|publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=082238695X |page=138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmsARjbW5BAC&amp;pg=PA138|language=en|date=2002-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Valerie Steele]] noted that hotpants, both as a name, and as a garment, quickly became associated with sexuality and [[prostitution]] due to their popularity with [[male gaze|male spectators]].&lt;ref name=girlculture/&gt;&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; In January 1971, a Manhattan-based male psychiatrist suggested that the popularity of hotpants lay in how they expressed a "female's new freedom", borrowing his phrasing from the [[women's liberation movement]],&lt;ref name=girlculture/&gt; but then went on to suggest that the wearer of hotpants wanted to relate to other people by drawing attention through "sexually provocative" dressing as a "prelude to a genuine relationship".&lt;ref name=klemesrud/&gt; By the mid-1970s, extremely short shorts had become shorthand for prostitution, particularly underage prostitution, as exemplified by the 1976 film ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', in which [[Jodie Foster]]'s child-prostitute character was dressed in a pair of hotpants.&lt;ref name=girlculture/&gt; Such associations contributed to hotpants becoming unattractive as a part of a woman's everyday wardrobe, although they remained popular wear in entertainment, party-wear and some evening contexts.&lt;ref name=girlculture/&gt; The controversial associations with hotpants were still an issue in 1999, when [[Britney Spears]] posed for a photoshoot in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wearing a pink pair.&lt;ref name=girlculture/&gt; The photographs, taken by [[David LaChapelle]], presented Spears in provocative poses, surrounded by dolls and tricycles, with the word "Baby" [[rhinestone]]d across the seat of her hotpants, and led to widespread media debate and public commentary about whether it was appropriate for role models for young girls to present themselves in such a "highly sexualised" manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duke |first1=Andrea |last2=Cornish |first2=Lindsay |editor1-last=Mitchell |editor1-first=Claudia |editor2-last=Reid-Walsh|editor2-first=Jacqueline|title=Girl Culture: Studying girl culture: a readers' guide|publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313339097 |pages=547–550 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&amp;pg=PA547 |chapter=Britney Spears}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Kylie Minogue]] notably wore a pair of gold [[lamé (fabric)|lamé]] hotpants in her music video for [[Spinning Around]], which led to widespread media focus on the garment and the singer's body within.&lt;ref name=legacymusicdocumentary&gt;{{cite book |last=Halligan |first=Benjamin |title=The Music Documentary: Acid Rock to Electropop |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-52802-3 |page=228 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4Wa3bSZKO04C&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Edgar, Robert |author3=Fairclough-Isaacs, Kirsty |accessdate=13 December 2013|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=legacysydneymorningherald&gt;{{cite web|last=Ricketson|first=Matthew|title=Kylie's seat of power|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/26/1027497413397.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=13 December 2013|date=27 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotpants were eventually donated by Minogue to the [[Performing Arts Collection]] museum at the [[Arts Centre Melbourne|Arts Centre, Melbourne]], where they are described as "one of the most identifiable items of contemporary popular culture."&lt;ref name=hotpantsdonatedcontactmusic&gt;{{cite web |title=Kylie Minogue – Kylie Minogue Donates Famous Hot Pants To Australian Museum|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/story/kylie-minogue-donates-famous-hot-pants-to-australian-museum_4067719|publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]]|accessdate=14 February 2014 |date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotpants, also called booty shorts continue being popular well into the 2010s, and are often seen in particular contexts such as [[Miami]]'s [[South Beach]] and [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]], [[Los Angeles]], whose beach-to-bar environments have unique dress codes.&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;

The '''India Government Mint, Mumbai''' is one of the four [[mint (coin)|mints]] in [[India]] and is in the city of [[Mumbai]]. The mint was established in 1829 by the then governor of the [[Bombay Presidency]]. Its main activity is the production of commemorative and development-oriented [[Indian coinage|coins]]. The mint is opposite the [[Reserve Bank of India]] in the [[Fort (area)|Fort]] area of [[South Mumbai]]. 

Initially governed by the governor of the Bombay Presidency, it was transferred to the [[Government of India]] on 18 May 1876 through Finance Department Resolution 247. In 1918, a branch of the [[Royal Mint]] of [[London]] was set up to issue [[United Kingdom|British]] sovereigns. In April 1919, after manufacturing 12.95 [[lakh]] (1.295 million) coins, it was shut down. 

Besides coins, the mint produces medals for Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs, educational institutions, social service institutions, badges etc. It is also a centre for the issuance of [[gold]] [[ingot]]s in exchange of unrefined gold tendered by licensed dealers. The institution has a department that makes official weights and measures such as metric weights, capacity, and linear measures for state governments, laboratories and the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]].

American '''Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War''' was essentially monitored and sanctioned by the [[Continental Congress]] to provide [[military intelligence]] to the [[Continental Army]] to aid them in fighting the [[kingdom of Great Britain|British]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  Congress created a Secret Committee for domestic intelligence, a [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]] for foreign intelligence, and a committee on spies, for tracking spies within the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] movement.

== Organization==

=== Secret Committee ===
The [[Second Continental Congress]] created a Secret Committee on September 18, 1775. The Committee was not, however, a true intelligence agency, since the Committee of Secret Correspondence with which it often worked was mainly concerned with obtaining military supplies in secret and distributing them, and selling gunpowder to [[privateers]] [[Letter of marque|chartered]] by the Congress. The Committee also took over and administered on a uniform basis the secret contracts for [[Weapon|arms]] and [[gunpowder]] previously negotiated by certain members of the Congress without the formal sanction of that body. The Committee kept its transactions secret and destroyed many of its records to ensure the confidentiality of its work.

The Secret Committee employed agents overseas, often in cooperation with the Committee of Secret Correspondence. It gathered intelligence about secret [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] ammunition stores and arranged to seize them. The Committee also sent missions to seize British supplies in the [[southern colonies]]. It arranged the purchase of military stores through intermediaries to conceal the fact that Congress was the true purchaser. They then used foreign [[flag]]s to attempt to protect the vessels from the British fleet.

The members of the Continental Congress appointed to the Committee included some of the most influential and responsible members of Congress: [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Robert Morris (merchant)|Robert Morris]], [[Robert Livingston (1746-1813)|Robert Livingston]], [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], [[Thomas Willing]], [[Thomas McKean]], [[John Langdon (politician)|John Langdon]], and [[Samuel Ward (American statesman)|Samuel Ward]].

=== Committee of (Secret) Correspondence ===
{{Main|Committee of Secret Correspondence}}
Recognizing the need for foreign intelligence and foreign alliances, the Second Continental Congress created the Committee of Correspondence (soon renamed the Committee of Secret Correspondence) by a resolution of November 29, 1775:

{{quote|RESOLVED, That a committee of five would be appointed for the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in Great Britain, and other parts of the world, and that they lay their correspondence before Congress when directed.

RESOLVED, That this Congress will make provision to defray all such expenses as they may arise by carrying on such correspondence, and for the payment of such agents as the said Committee may send on this service.}}

The original Committee members—America's first foreign intelligence agency—were [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Benjamin Harrison V|Benjamin Harrison]], [[Thomas Johnson (jurist)|Thomas Johnson]]. Subsequent appointees included [[James Lovell (delegate)|James Lovell]], a teacher who had been arrested by the British after the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] on charges of spying. He had later been exchanged for a British prisoner and was elected to the Continental Congress. On the Committee, he became the Congress' expert on [[codes]] and [[ciphers]] and has been called the father of American [[cryptanalysis]].

The committee employed secret agents abroad, conducted covert operations, devised codes and ciphers, funded propaganda activities, authorized the opening of private mail, acquired foreign publications for use in analysis, established a courier system, and developed a maritime capability apart from that of the [[Continental Navy]], and engaged in regular communications with Britons and Scots who sympathized with the American cause. It met secretly in December 1775 with a French intelligence agent who visited [[Philadelphia]] under cover as a [[Flemings|Flemish]] [[merchant]].

On April 17, 1777, the Committee of Secret Correspondence was renamed the [[Committee of Foreign Affairs]] but kept with its intelligence function. Matters of diplomacy were conducted by other committees or by the Congress as a whole. On January 10, 1781, the [[Department of Foreign Affairs]]—the forerunner of the [[Department of State]]—was created and tasked with "obtaining the most extensive and useful information relative to foreign affairs", the head of which was empowered to correspond "with all other persons from whom he may expect to receive useful information."

=== Committee on Spies ===
On June 5, 1776, the Congress appointed [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Edward Rutledge]], [[James Wilson]], and Robert Livingston "to consider what is proper to be done with persons giving intelligence to the enemy or supplying them with provisions." They were charged with revising the [[Articles of War]] in regard to espionage directed against the American forces. The problem was an urgent one: Dr. [[Benjamin Church (physician)|Benjamin Church]], chief physician of the [[Continental Army]], had already been seized and imprisoned as a British agent, but there was no civilian espionage act, and [[George Washington]] thought the existing military law did not provide punishment severe enough to afford a deterrent. On November 7, 1775, the death penalty was added for espionage to the Articles of War, but the clause was not applied retroactively, and Dr. Church escaped execution.

On August 21, 1776, the Committee's report was considered by the Congress, which enacted the first espionage act:

&lt;blockquote&gt;RESOLVED, That all persons not members of, nor owing allegiance to, any of the United States of America, as described in a resolution to the Congress of the 29th of June last, who shall be found lurking as spies in or about the fortification or encampments of the armies of the United States, or of any of them, shall suffer death, according to the law and usage of nations, by sentence of a [[court martial]], or such other punishment as such court martial may direct.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was resolved further that the act "be printed at the end of the rules and articles of war." On February 27, 1778, the law was broadened to include any "inhabitants of these states" whose intelligence activities aided the enemy in capturing or killing revolutionary forces.

==Techniques==

===Secrecy and protection===
The Committee of Secret Correspondence insisted that matters pertaining to the funding and instruction of intelligence agents be held within the Committee. In calling for the Committee members to "lay their proceedings before Congress," the Congress, by resolution, authorized "withholding the names of the persons they have employed, or with whom they have corresponded." On May 20, 1776, when the Committee's proceedings—with the sensitive names removed—were finally read in the Congress, it was "under the injunction of secrecy." The Continental Congress, recognizing the need for secrecy in regard to foreign intelligence, foreign alliances and military matters, maintained "Secret Journals," apart from its public journals, to record its decisions in such matters.

On November 9, 1775, the Continental Congress adopted its own oath of secrecy, one more stringent than the oaths of secrecy it would require of others in sensitive employment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;RESOLVED, That every member of this Congress considers himself under the ties of virtue, honour and love of his country, not to divulge, directly or indirectly, any matter or thing agitated or debated in Congress, before the same shaft have been determined, without the leave of the Congress: nor any matter or thing determined in Congress, which a majority of the Congress shall order to be kept secret, And that if any member shall violate this agreement, he shall be expelled this Congress, and deemed an enemy to the liberties of America, and liable to be treated as such, and that every member signify his consent to this agreement by signing the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 12, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the first secrecy agreement for employees of the new government. The required oath read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do solemnly swear, that I will not directly or indirectly divulge any manner or thing which shall come to my knowledge as (clerk, secretary) of the board of War and Ordnance for the United Colonies. . . So help me God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Continental Congress, sensitive to the vulnerability of its covert allies, respected their desire for strict secrecy. Even after France's declaration of war against England, the fact of French involvement prior to that time remained a state secret. When [[Thomas Paine]], in a series of letters to the press in 1777, divulged details of the secret aid from the files of the Committee of Foreign Affairs (formerly, the Committee of Secret Correspondence), France's Minister to the United States, Conrad Alexander Gerard, protested to the president of the Congress that Paine's indiscreet assertions "bring into question the dignity and reputation of the King, my master, and that of the United States." Congress dismissed Paine, and by public resolution denied having received such aid, resolving that "His Most Christian Majesty, the great and generous ally of the United States, did not preface his alliance with any supplies whatever sent to America."

In 1779, George Washington and [[John Jay]], the president of the Continental Congress and a close associate of the Commander in Chief's on intelligence matters, disagreed about the effect disclosure of some intelligence would have on sources and methods. Washington wanted to publicize certain encouraging information that he judged would give "a certain spring to our affairs" and bolster public morale. Jay replied that the intelligence "is unfortunately of such a Nature, or rather so circumstanced, as to render Secrecy necessary." Jay prevailed.

===Cover===
[[Robert Townsend (spy)|Robert Townsend]], an important American agent in the British-occupied city of New York, used the guise of being a merchant, as did [[Silas Deane]] when he was sent to France by the Committee of Secret Correspondence. Townsend was usually referred to by his cover name of "Culper, Junior." When Major [[Benjamin Tallmadge]], who directed Townsend's espionage work, insisted that he disengage himself from his cover business to devote more time to intelligence gathering, General Washington overruled him: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;it is not my opinion that Culper Junior should be advised to give up his present employment. I would imagine that with a little industry he will be able to carry on his intelligence with greater security to himself and greater advantages to us, under the cover of his usual business. . .. it prevents also those suspicions which would become natural should he throw himself out of the line of his present employment.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Townsend also was the silent partner of a coffee house frequented by British officers, an ideal place for hearing loose talk that was of value to the American cause.

Major [[John Clark (spy)|John Clark]]'s agents in and around British-controlled Philadelphia used several covers (farmer, peddler, and smuggler, among others) so effectively that only one or two operatives may have been detained. The agents traveled freely in and out of Philadelphia and passed intelligence to Washington about British troops, fortifications, and supplies, and of a planned surprise attack.

[[Enoch Crosby]], a counterintelligence officer, posed as an unsuspecting shoemaker (his civilian trade) to travel through southern New York state while infiltrating Loyalist cells. After the Tories started to suspect him when he kept "escaping" from the Americans, Crosby's superiors moved him to [[Albany, New York]], where he resumed his undercover espionage.

[[John Honeyman]], an Irish weaver who had offered to spy for the Americans, used several covers (butcher, Tory, British agent) to collect intelligence on British military activities in [[New Jersey]]. He participated in a deception operation that left the [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]]s in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] unprepared for [[Battle of Trenton|Washington's attack]] across the [[Delaware River]] on December 26, 1776.

===Disguise===
In January 1778, Nancy Morgan Hart, who was tall, muscular, and cross-eyed, disguised herself as a "touched" or emotionally disturbed man, and entered [[Augusta, Georgia]], to obtain intelligence on British defenses. Her mission was a success. Later, when a group of Tories attacked her home to gain revenge, she captured them all and was witness to their execution.

In June 1778, General Washington instructed [[Henry Lee III|Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee]] to send an agent into the British fort at [[Stony Point, New York]], to gather intelligence on the exact size of the garrison and the progress it was making in building defenses. Captain Allan McLane took the assignment. Dressing himself as a [[yokel|country bumpkin]] and utilizing the cover of escorting a Mrs. Smith into the fort to see her sons, McLane spent two weeks collecting intelligence within the British fort and returned safely.

While serving in Paris as an agent of the Committee of Secret Correspondence, Silas Deane is known to have used a heat-developing [[invisible ink]]—a compound of cobalt chloride, glycerine and water—for some of his intelligence reports back to America. Even more useful to him later was a "sympathetic stain" created for secret communications by James Jay, a physician and the brother of John Jay. Dr. Jay, who had been knighted by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], used the "stain" for reporting military information from London to America. Later he supplied quantities of the stain to George Washington at home and to Silas Deane in Paris.

The stain required one chemical for writing the message and a second to develop it, affording greater security than the ink used by Deane earlier. Once, in a letter to [[John Jay]], Robert Morris spoke of an innocuous letter from "Timothy Jones" (Deane) and the "concealed beauties therein," noting "the cursory examinations of a sea captain would never discover them, but transferred from his hand to the penetrating eye of a Jay, the diamonds stand confessed at once."

Washington instructed his agents in the use of the "sympathetic stain," noting in connection with "Culper Junior" that the ink "will not only render his communications less exposed to detection, but relieve the fears of such persons as may be entrusted in its conveyance." Washington suggested that reports could be written in the invisible ink "on the blank leaves of a pamphlet. . . a common pocket book, or on the blank leaves at each end of registers, almanacks, or any publication or book of small value."

Washington especially recommended that agents conceal their reports by using the ink in correspondence: "A much better way is to write a letter in the Tory stile with some mixture of family matters and between the lines and on the remaining part of the sheet communicate with the Stain the intended intelligence."

Even though the Patriots took great care to write sensitive messages in invisible ink, or in code or cipher, it is estimated that the British intercepted and decrypted over half of America's secret correspondence during the war.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/intelligence-history/intelligence/intelltech.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Codes and ciphers===
American Revolutionary leaders used various methods of [[cryptography]] to conceal diplomatic, military, and personal messages.

John Jay and Arthur Lee devised dictionary codes in which numbers referred to the page and line in an agreed-upon dictionary edition where the plaintext (unencrypted message) could be found.

In 1775, Charles Dumas designed the first diplomatic cipher that the Continental Congress and Benjamin Franklin used to communicate with agents and ministers in Europe. Dumas's system substituted numbers for letters in the order in which they appeared in a preselected paragraph of French prose containing 682 symbols. This method was more secure than the standard alphanumeric substitution system, in which a through z are replaced with 1 through 26, because each letter in the plain text could be replaced with more than one number.

The [[Culper Ring (Revolutionary War)|Culper Spy Ring]] used a numerical substitution code developed by Major [[Benjamin Tallmadge]], the network's leader. The Ring began using the code after the British captured some papers indicating that some Americans around New York were using "sympathetic stain." Tallmadge took several hundred words from a dictionary and several dozen names of people or places and assigned each a number from 1 to 763. For example, 38 meant attack, 192 stood for fort, George Washington was identified as 711, and New York was replaced by 727. An American agent posing as a deliveryman transmitted the messages to other members of the Ring. One of them, [[Anna Strong (spy)]], signaled the message's location with a code involving laundry hung out to dry. A black petticoat indicated that a message was ready to be picked up, and the number of handkerchiefs identified the cove on [[Long Island Sound]] where the agents would meet. By the end of the war, several prominent Americans—among them Robert Morris, John Jay, Robert Livingston, and John Adams—were using other versions of numerical substitution codes.

The Patriots had two notable successes in breaking British ciphers. In 1775, [[Elbridge Gerry]] and the team of Elisha Porter and the Rev. Samuel West, working separately at Washington's direction, decrypted a letter that implicated Dr. Benjamin Church, the Continental Army's chief surgeon, in espionage for the British.

In 1781, James Lovell, who designed cipher systems used by several prominent Americans, determined the encryption method that British commanders used to communicate with each other. When a dispatch from [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] in [[Yorktown, Virginia]], to General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]] in New York was intercepted, Lovell's cryptanalysis enabled Washington to gauge how desperate Cornwallis's situation was and to time his [[Siege of Yorktown|attack on the British lines]]. Soon after, another decrypt by Lovell provided warning to the French fleet off Yorktown that a British relief expedition was approaching. The French [[Battle of the Chesapeake|scared off the British flotilla]], sealing victory for the Americans.

===Intercepting communications===
The Continental Congress regularly received quantities of intercepted British and Tory mail. On November 20, 1775, it received some intercepted letters from [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland, and appointed a committee made up of John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Johnson, Robert Livingston, Edward Rutledge, James Wilson and George Wythe "to select such parts of them as may be proper to publish." The Congress later ordered a thousand copies of the portions selected by the Committee to be printed and distributed. A month later, when another batch of intercepted mail was received, a second committee was appointed to examine it. Based on its report, the Congress resolved that "the contents of the intercepted letters this day read, and the steps which Congress may take in consequence of said intelligence thereby given, be kept secret until further orders." By early 1776, abuses were noted in the practice, and Congress resolved that only the councils or committees of safety of each colony, and their designees, could henceforth open the mail or detain any letters from the post.

When Moses Harris reported that the British had recruited him as a courier for their Secret Service, General Washington proposed that General Schuyler "contrive a means of opening them without breaking the seals, take copies of the contents, and then let them go on. By these means we should become masters of the whole plot." From that point on, Washington was privy to British intelligence pouches between New York and Canada.

===Technology===
Dr. James Jay used the advanced technology of his time in creating the invaluable "sympathetic stain" used for secret communications. Perhaps the American Patriots' most advanced application of technology was in [[David Bushnell]]'s ''[[American Turtle|Turtle]]'', a one-man submarine created for affixing watchwork-timed explosive charges to the bottom of enemy ships.

The "turtle," now credited with being the first use of the submarine in warfare, was an oaken chamber about five-and-a-half feet (1.6 m) wide and seven feet (2.1 m) high. It was propelled by a front-mounted, pedal-powered propeller at a speed of up to three miles per hour (5&amp;nbsp;km/h), had a [[barometer]] to read depth, a pump to raise or lower the submarine through the water, and provision for both lead and water [[Ballast tank|ballast]].

When Bushnell learned that the candle used to illuminate instruments inside the "turtle" consumed the oxygen in its air supply, he turned to Benjamin Franklin for help. The solution: the phosphorescent weed, [[Foxfire (bioluminescence)|foxfire]]. Heavy tides thwarted the first sabotage operation. A copper-clad hull which could not be penetrated by the submarine's auger foiled the second. (The "turtle" did blow up a nearby schooner, however.) The secret weapon would almost certainly have achieved success against a warship if it had not gone to the bottom of the [[Hudson River]] when the mother ship to which it was moored was sunk by the British in October 1776.

An early device developed for concealing intelligence reports when traveling by water was a simple weighted bottle that could be dropped overboard if there was a threat of capture. This was replaced by a wafer-thin leaden container in which a message was sealed. It would sink in water, and melt in fire, and could be used by agents on land or water. It had one drawback—[[lead poisoning]] if it was swallowed. It was replaced by a silver, bullet-shaped container that could be unscrewed to hold a message and which would not poison a courier who might be forced to swallow it.

===Intelligence analysis and estimates===
On May 29, 1775, the Continental Congress received the first of many intelligence estimates prepared in response to questions it posed to military commanders. The report estimated the size of the enemy force to be encountered in an attack on New York, the number of Continental troops needed to meet it, and the kind of force needed to defend the other New England colonies.

An example of George Washington's interest in intelligence analysis and estimates can be found in instructions he wrote to General Putnam in August 1777:"Deserters and people of that class always speak of number. ... Indeed, scarce any person can form a judgement unless he sees the troops paraded and can count the divisions. But, if you can by any means obtain a list of the regiments left upon the island, we can compute the number of men within a few hundreds, over or under." On another occasion, in thanking James Lovell for a piece of intelligence, Washington wrote: "It is by comparing a variety of information, we are frequently enabled to investigate facts, which were so intricate or hidden, that no single clue could have led to the knowledge of them. ... Intelligence becomes interesting which but from its connection and collateral circumstances, would not be important."

[[Colonel David Henley]], Washington's intelligence chief for a short period in 1778, received these instructions when he wrote to Washington for guidance: "Besides communicating your information as it arises. ... you might make out a table or something in the way of columns, under which you might range, their magazines of forage, grain and the like, the different corps and regiments, the Works, where thrown up, their connexion, kind and extent, the officers commanding, with the numbers of guns &amp;ca. &amp;ca. This table should comprehend in one view all that can be learned from deserters, spies and persons who may come out from the enemy's boundaries." (It was common practice to [[interrogation|interrogate]] travelers from such British strongholds as New York, [[Boston]] and Philadelphia.)

==Personalities==

===George Washington===
George Washington was a skilled manager of intelligence. He utilized agents behind enemy lines, recruited both Tory and Patriot sources, interrogated travelers for intelligence information, and launched scores of agents on both intelligence and counterintelligence missions. He was adept at deception operations and tradecraft and was a skilled propagandist. He also practiced sound operational security.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/the-revolutionary-war/spying-and-espionage/george-washington-spymaster/  "George Washington, Spymaster" at ''George Washington's Mount Vernon''] &lt;/ref&gt; 

As an intelligence manager, Washington insisted that the terms of an agent's employment and his instructions be precise and in writing. He emphasized his desire for receiving written, rather than verbal, reports. He demanded repeatedly that intelligence reports be expedited, reminding his officers of those bits of intelligence he had received which had become valueless because of delay in getting them to him. He also recognized the need for developing many different sources so that their reports could be cross-checked, and so that the compromise of one source would not cut off the flow of intelligence from an important area.

Washington sought and obtained a "secret service fund" from the Continental Congress, and expressed preference for specie, preferably gold: "I have always found a difficulty in procuring intelligence by means of paper money, and I perceive it increases." In accounting for the sums in his journals, he did not identify the recipients: "The names of persons who are employed within the Enemy's lines or who may fall within their power cannot be inserted."

He instructed his generals to "leave no stone unturned, nor do not stick to expense" in gathering intelligence, and urged that those employed for intelligence purposes be those "upon whose firmness and fidelity we may safely rely."

===Washington's intelligence officers===
Washington retained full and final authority over Continental Army intelligence activities, but he delegated significant field responsibility to trusted officers. Although he regularly urged all his officers to be more active in collecting intelligence, Washington relied chiefly on his aides and specially designated officers to assist him in conducting intelligence operations. The first to assume this role appears to have been [[Joseph Reed (jurist)|Joseph Reed]], who fulfilled the duties of "Secretary, Adjutant General and Quarter Master, besides doing a thousand other little Things which fell incidentally." A later successor to Reed was [[Alexander Hamilton]], who is known to have been deeply involved with the Commander-in-Chief's intelligence operations, including developing reports received in secret writing and investigating a suspected double agent.

When [[Elias Boudinot]] was appointed Commissary General of Prisoners, responsible for screening captured soldiers and for dealing with the British concerning American patriots whom they held prisoner, Washington recognized that the post offered "better opportunities than most other officers in the army, to obtain knowledge of the Enemy's Situation, motions and... designs," and added to Boudinot's responsibilities "the procuring of intelligence." In 1778, Washington selected Brigadier General [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]] of [[Virginia]] as his "intelligence chief." When personal considerations made it necessary for Scott to step down, Washington appointed Colonel David Henley to the post temporarily, and then assigned it to Major [[Benjamin Tallmadge]]. Tallmadge combined reconnaissance with clandestine visits into British territory to recruit agents, and he attained distinction for his conduct of the Culper Ring operating out of New York.

In 1776, George Washington picked [[Thomas Knowlton]] to command the Continental Army's first intelligence unit, known as "Knowlton's Rangers." Intelligence failure during the [[battle of Long Island]] convinced Washington that he needed an elite detachment dedicated to reconnaissance that reported directly to him. Knowlton, who had served in a similar unit during the [[French and Indian War]], led 130 men and 20 officers—all hand-picked volunteers—on a variety of secret missions that were too dangerous for regular troops to conduct. The date 1776 on the seal of the Army's intelligence service today refers to the formation of Knowlton's Rangers.

Other intelligence officers who served with distinction during the War of Independence included Captain Eli Leavenworth, Major Alexander Clough, Colonel Elias Dayton, Major John Clark, Major Allan McLane, Captain Charles Craig and General Thomas Mifflin.

===Paul Revere and the Mechanics===
{{See also|Paul Revere}}
[[Image:Joseph warren.gif|thumb|right|Dr. Joseph Warren]]
The first Patriot intelligence network on record was a secret group in Boston known as the Mechanics, which meant skilled workers. The group, also known as the Liberty Boys, apparently grew out of the old [[Sons of Liberty]] organization that had successfully opposed the [[Stamp Act]]. The Mechanics organized resistance to British authority and gathered intelligence. In the words of one of its members, Paul Revere, "in the Fall of 1774 and winter of 1775, I was one of upwards of thirty, chiefly mechanics, who formed ourselves into a Committee for the purpose of watching British soldiers and gaining every intelligence on the movements of the Tories." According to Revere, "We frequently took turns, two and two, to watch the (British) soldiers by patrolling the streets all night."

In addition, the Mechanics  [[sabotage]]d and stole British military equipment in Boston. Their security practices, however, were amateurish. They met in the same place regularly (the [[Green Dragon Tavern]]), and one of their leaders (Dr. Benjamin Church) was a British agent.

Through their intelligence sources, the Mechanics were able to see through the cover story the British had devised to mask their march on [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]]. Dr. Joseph Warren, chairman of the Committee of Safety, charged Revere with the task of warning [[Samuel Adams]] and [[John Hancock]] at [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], that they were the probable targets of the enemy operation. Revere arranged for the warning lanterns to be hung in [[Old North Church]] to alert patriot forces at Charlestown, and then set off on his [[Paul Revere#The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere|famous ride]]. He completed his primary mission of notifying Adams and Hancock. Then Revere, along with Dr. Samuel Prescott and William Dawes, rode on to alert Concord, only to be apprehended by the British en route. Dawes got away, and Dr. Prescott managed to escape soon afterward and to alert the Patriots at Concord. Revere was interrogated and subsequently released, after which he returned to Lexington to warn Hancock and Adams of the proximity of British forces.

Revere then turned to another mission, retrieving from the local tavern a trunk belonging to Hancock and filled with incriminating papers. With John Lowell, Revere went to the tavern and, as he put it, during "a continual roar of Musquetry... we made off with the Trunk."

Paul Revere had served as a courier prior to his "midnight ride" and continued to do so during the early years of the war. One of his earlier missions was perhaps as important as the Lexington ride. In December 1774, Revere rode to the [[Oyster River (New Hampshire)|Oyster River]] in [[New Hampshire]] with a report that the British, under General [[Thomas Gage]], intended to seize [[Fort William and Mary]]. Armed with this intelligence, Major John Sullivan of the colonial militia led a force of four hundred men in an attack on the fort. The one hundred barrels of gunpowder taken in the raid were ultimately used by the Patriots to cover their retreat from [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]].

===Agents===

====Nathan Hale====
{{Main|Nathan Hale}}
[[Image:Nathan hale.gif|thumb|right|Nathan Hale at the gallows.]]
Nathan Hale is probably the best known but least successful American agent in the War of Independence. He embarked on his espionage mission into British-held New York as a volunteer, impelled by a strong sense of patriotism and duty. Before leaving on the mission he reportedly told a fellow officer: "I am not influenced by the expectation of promotion or pecuniary award; I wish to be useful, and every kind of service necessary to the public good becomes honorable by being necessary. If the exigencies of my country demand a peculiar service, its claims to perform that service are imperious."

But dedication was not enough. Captain Hale had no training experience, no contacts in New York, no channels of communication, and no cover story to explain his absence from camp—only his [[Yale University|Yale]] diploma supported his contention that he was a "Dutch schoolmaster." He was captured while trying to slip out of New York, was convicted as a spy and went to the gallows on September 22, 1776. Witnesses to the execution reported the dying words that gained him immortality (a paraphrase of a line from [[Joseph Addison]]'s play ''Cato''): "I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country." After he was accused of being a spy he stated his name, rank, and his reason for being there. He gave a soldier a letter to his family, which was ripped up. He asked to see a bible and was denied the right.
====Haym Salomon====
{{Main|Haym Salomon}}
The same day that Nathan Hale was executed in New York, British authorities arrested another Patriot and charged him with being a spy. Haym Salomon was a recent Jewish immigrant who worked as a stay-behind agent after Washington evacuated New York City in September 1776. Salomon was arrested in a round-up of suspected Patriot sympathizers and was confined to Sugar House Prison. He spoke several European languages and was soon released to the custody of [[Leopold Philip de Heister|General von Heister]], commander of [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] mercenaries, who needed someone who could serve as a [[German language]] interpreter in the Hessian commissary department. While in German custody, Salomon induced a number of the German troops to resign or desert.

Eventually paroled, Salomon did not flee to [[Philadelphia]] as had many of his New York business associates. He continued to serve as an undercover agent and used his personal finances to assist American patriots held prisoner in New York. He was arrested again in August 1778, accused this time of being an accomplice in a plot to burn the British fleet and to destroy His Majesty's warehouses in the city. Salomon was condemned to death for sabotage, but he bribed his guard while awaiting execution and escaped to Philadelphia. There he came into the open in the role for which he is best known, as an important financier of the Revolution.

====Abraham Patten====
Less than a year after Nathan Hale was executed, another American agent went to the gallows in New York. On June 13, 1777, General Washington wrote the President of Congress: "You will observe by the New York paper, the execution of Abm. (Abraham) Patten. His family deserves the generous Notice of Congress. He conducted himself with great fidelity to our Cause rendering Services and has fallen a Sacrifice in promoting her interest. Perhaps a public act of generosity, considering the character he was in, might not be so eligible as a private donation."

====Culper Ring====
{{Main|Culper Ring (Revolutionary War)}}
"Most accurate and explicit intelligence" resulted from the work of [[Abraham Woodhull]] on Long Island and Robert Townsend in British-occupied New York City. Their operation, known as the Culper Ring from the operational names used by Woodhull (Culper Sr.) and Townsend (Culper Jr.), effectively used such intelligence tradecraft as codes, ciphers and secret ink for communications; a series of couriers and whaleboats to transmit reporting; at least one secret safe house, and numerous sources. The network was particularly effective in picking up valuable information from careless conversation wherever the British and their sympathizers gathered.

One female member of the Culper Ring, known only by her codename "355," was arrested shortly after [[Benedict Arnold]]'s defection in 1780 and evidently died in captivity. Details of her background are unknown, but 355 (the number meant "lady" in the Culper code) may have come from a prominent Tory family with access to British commanders and probably reported on their activities and personalities. She was one of several females around the debonaire [[John André|Major André]], who enjoyed the company of young, attractive, and intelligent women. Abraham Woodhull, 355's recruiter, praised her espionage work, saying that she was "one who hath been ever serviceable to this correspondence." Arnold questioned all of André's associates after his execution in October 1780 and grew suspicious when the pregnant 355 refused to identify her paramour. She was incarcerated on the squalid prison ship ''Jersey'', moored in the East River. There she gave birth to a son and then died without disclosing that she had a common-law husband – Robert Townsend, after whom the child was named.

One controversial American agent in New York was the King's Printer, James Rivington.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Snell Crary,  "The Tory and the Spy: The Double Life of James Rivington." ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1959): 16#1 pp 61-72. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1918851 online]
&lt;/ref&gt; His coffee house, a favorite gathering place for the British, was a principal source of information for Culper Jr. (Townsend), who was a silent partner in the endeavor. George Washington Parke Custis suggests that Rivington's motive for aiding the patriot cause was purely monetary. Custis notes that Rivington, nevertheless, "proved faithful to his bargain, and often would provide intelligence of great importance gleaned in convivial moments at Sir William's or Sir Henry's table, be in the American camp before the convivialists had slept off the effects of their wine. The King's printer would probably have been the last man suspected, for during the whole of his connection with the secret service his Royal Gazette piled abuse of every sort upon the cause of the American general and the cause of America." Rivington's greatest espionage achievement was acquiring the [[Royal Navy]]'s signal book in 1781. That intelligence helped the French fleet repel a British flotilla trying to relieve General Cornwallis at Yorktown.

====Hercules Mulligan====
{{Main|Hercules Mulligan}}
Hercules Mulligan was a textile importer and ran a clothing shop that was also frequented by British officers in occupied New York. The Irish immigrant was a genial host, and animated conversation typified a visit to his emporium.  Mulligan was the first to alert Washington to two British plans to capture the American Commander-in-Chief and to a planned incursion into Pennsylvania. Besides being an American agent, Mulligan also was a British counterintelligence failure. Before he went underground as an agent, he had been an active member of the Sons of Liberty and the New York Committees of Correspondence and Observation, local Patriot intelligence groups. Mulligan had participated in acts of rebellion, and his name had appeared on Patriot broadsides distributed in New York as late as 1776. But every time he fell under suspicion, the popular Irishman used his gift of "[[wikt:blarney#Noun|blarney]]" to talk his way out of it. The British evidently never learned that Alexander Hamilton, Washington's aide-de-camp, had lived in the Mulligan home while attending [[Columbia University|King's College]], and had recruited Mulligan and possibly Mulligan's brother, a banker and merchant who handled British accounts, for espionage. Mulligan was assisted by his slave, [[Cato (American Revolution)|Cato]], who performed dangerous assignments as a courier.

====Lewis Costigin====
Lieutenant Lewis J. Costigin, walked the streets of New York freely in his Continental Army uniform as he collected intelligence. Costigin had originally been sent to New York as a prisoner and was eventually paroled under oath not to attempt escape or communicate intelligence. In September 1778, he was designated for prisoner exchange and freed of his parole oath. But he did not leave New York, and until January 1779 he roamed the city in his American uniform, gathering intelligence on British commanders, troop deployments, shipping, and logistics while giving the impression of still being a paroled prisoner.

====William Heath====
{{Main|William Heath}}
On May 15, 1780, General Washington instructed General Heath to send intelligence agents into Canada. He asked that they be those "upon whose firmness and fidelity we may safely rely," and that they collect "exact" information about [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] in support of a French requirement for information on the British defense works there. Washington suggested that qualified draftsmen be sent. James Bowdoin, who later became the first president of the American Academy of Arts and Science, fulfilled the intelligence mission, providing detailed plans of Halifax harbor, including specific military works and even water depths.

====Daniel Bissell====
{{Main|Daniel Bissell (spy)}}
In August 1782, General Washington created the [[Badge of Military Merit]], to be issued "whenever any singularly meritorious action is performed... not only instances of unusual gallantry, but also of extraordinary fidelity and essential service in any way." Through the award, said Washington, "the road to glory in a Patriot army and a free country is thus open to all." The following June, the honor was bestowed on Sergeant Daniel Bissell, who had "deserted" from the Continental Army, infiltrated New York, posed as a Tory, and joined Benedict Arnold's "American Legion." For over a year, Bissell gathered information on British fortifications, making a detailed study of British methods of operation, before escaping to American lines.

====Dominique L'Eclise====
Dominique L'Eclise, a Canadian who served as an intelligence agent for General Schuyler, had been detected and imprisoned and had all his property confiscated. After being informed by General Washington of the agent's plight, the Continental Congress on October 23, 1778, granted $600 to pay L'Eclise's debts and $60, plus one ration a day "during the pleasure of Congress," as compensation for his contribution to the American cause.

====Lydia Darragh====
{{Main|Lydia Darragh}}
Family legend contributes the colorful but uncorroborated story of Lydia Darragh and her listening post for eavesdropping on the British. Officers of the British force occupying Philadelphia chose to use a large upstairs room in the Darragh house for conferences. When they did, Mrs. Darragh would slip into an adjoining closet and take notes on the enemy's military plans. Her husband, William, would transcribe the intelligence in a form of shorthand on tiny slips of paper that Lydia would then position on a button mold before covering it with fabric. The message-bearing buttons were then sewn onto the coat of her fourteen-year-old son, John, who would then be sent to visit his elder brother, Lieutenant Charles Darragh, of the American forces outside the city. Charles would snip off the buttons and transcribe the shorthand notes into readable form for presentation to his officers.

Lydia Darragh is said to have concealed other intelligence in a sewing-needle packet which she carried in her purse when she passed through British lines. Some espionage historians have questioned the credibility of the best-known story of Darragh's espionage: that she supposedly overheard British commanders planning a surprise night attack against Washington's army at [[Battle of White Marsh|Whitemarsh]] on December 4, 1777.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Darrach, ''Lydia Darragh, One of the Heroines of the Revolution'' (1916).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan Vicente Ugarte del Pino''' (June 12, 1923 – October 6, 2015) was a Peruvian [[historian]], [[jurist]] and [[lawyer]]. A judge and noted jurist, Ugarte del Pino was a member of the legal team which represented Peru before the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) during a 2008 case over the [[Chilean–Peruvian maritime dispute]].&lt;ref name=comercio&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Murió Vicente Ugarte del Pino, miembro de equipo ante La Haya |url=http://elcomercio.pe/politica/actualidad/murio-vicente-ugarte-pino-miembro-equipo-ante-haya-noticia-1846217 |work=[[El Comercio (Peru)]] |date=2014-10-06 |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=andina&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Falleció a los 92 años el historiador y jurista Vicente Ugarte del Pino |url=http://www.andina.com.pe/agencia/noticia-fallecio-a-los-92-anos-historiador-y-jurista-vicente-ugarte-del-pino-578511.aspx |work=Andina |date=2014-10-06 |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugarte del Pino served as the dean of the [[Bar Association]] of [[Lima]] (''Colegio de Abogados de Lima'') (CAL) from 1974 to 1975, which coincided with the [[dictatorship]] of [[President of Peru|President]] [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]].&lt;ref name=comercio/&gt;  Ugarte del Pino was a prominent critics of the erosion of the [[rule of law]] in Peru by Velasco.&lt;ref name=comercio/&gt; The Velasco government prosecuted and imprisoned Ugarte del Pino for counterrevolutionary crimes for his vocal opposition.&lt;ref name=comercio/&gt; Juan Velasco Alvarado was overthrown in 1975.

'''Libertarian Marxism''' refers to a broad scope of [[Philosophy and economics|economic]] and [[Political philosophy|political philosophies]] that emphasize the [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] aspects of [[Marxism]]. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as [[left communism]], emerged in opposition to [[Marxism–Leninism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], Otto Ruhl ''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils''. Red and Black, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and its derivatives, such as [[Stalinism]], [[Ceaușism]] and [[Maoism]]. Libertarian Marxism is also often critical of [[reformist]] positions, such as those held by [[Social democracy|social democrats]]. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a [[Communist party|revolutionary party]] or [[State (polity)|state]] to mediate or aid its liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Draper, Hal. [https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/srv/article/view/5333"The Principle of Self-Emancipation in Marx and Engels"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723070247/https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/srv/article/view/5333 |date=2011-07-23 }} "The Socialist Register." Vol 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[anarchism]], libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of [[libertarian socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam.

Libertarian Marxism includes such currents as [[council communism]], [[De Leonism]], [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]], [[Lettrism]]/[[Situationist International|Situationism]] and [[workerism]]/[[autonomism]] and parts of the [[New Left]].&lt;ref name=map&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/libertarian-marxist-tendency-map |title=A libertarian Marxist tendency map |publisher=Libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both [[Post-left anarchy|post-left]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]]. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Maurice Brinton]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Daniel Guérin]], [[Fredy Perlman]], [[Ernesto Screpanti]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]].

== Overview ==
Marxism started to develop a libertarian strand of thought after specific circumstances. "One does find early expressions of such perspectives in [[William Morris|Morris]] and the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (the SPGB), then again around the events of 1905, with the growing concern at the bureaucratisation and de-radicalisation of international socialism".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"&gt;"The [http://www.democracynature.org/vol7/ojeili_intellectuals.htm 'Advance Without Authority']: Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism and Intellectuals" by Chamsy Ojeili, ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'' vol.7, no.3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; William Morris established the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] in December 1884, which was encouraged by [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Eleanor Marx]]. As the leading figure in the organization Morris embarked on a relentless series of speeches and talks on street corners, in working men's clubs and lecture theatres across England and Scotland. From 1887, [[anarchism|anarchists]] began to outnumber Marxists in the Socialist League.&lt;ref name="Beer, pg. 256"&gt;Beer, ''A History of British Socialism,'' vol. 2, pg. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd Annual Conference of the League held in London on 29 May 1887 marked the change, with a majority of the 24 branch delegates voting in favor of an anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring: "This conference endorses the policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto pursued by the League, and sees no sufficient reason for altering it".&lt;ref&gt;''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 48.'' New York: International Publishers, 2001; pg. 538, fn. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  Morris played peacemaker, but sided with the anti-parliamentarians, who won control of the League, which consequently lost the support of Engels and saw the departure of Eleanor Marx and her partner [[Edward Aveling]] to form the separate [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)#Anarchist control|Bloomsbury Socialist Society]].

=== 20th century ===
However, "the most important ruptures are to be traced to the insurgency during and after the First World War. Disillusioned with the capitulation of the social democrats, excited by the emergence of workers' councils, and slowly distanced from Leninism, many communists came to reject the claims of socialist parties and to put their faith instead in the masses". For these socialists, "[t]he intuition of the masses in action can have more genius in it than the work of the greatest individual genius". Luxemburg's workerism and spontaneism are exemplary of positions later taken up by the far-left of the period&amp;mdash;[[Anton Pannekoek|Pannekoek]], Roland Holst and [[Herman Gorter|Gorter]] in the Netherlands, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] in Britain, [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]] in Italy and [[György Lukács|Lukacs]] in Hungary. In these formulations, the dictatorship of the proletariat was to be the dictatorship of a class, "not of a party or of a clique".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt; However, within this line of thought, "[t]he tension between anti-vanguardism and vanguardism has frequently resolved itself in two diametrically opposed ways: the first involved a drift towards the party; the second saw a move towards the idea of complete proletarian spontaneity.... The first course is exemplified most clearly in Gramsci and [[György Lukács|Lukacs]].... The second course is illustrated in the tendency, developing from the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined towards the complete eradication of the party form".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt;

In the emerging Soviet state, there appeared [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]] which were a series of [[rebellion]]s and uprisings against the [[Bolshevik]]s led or supported by left wing groups including [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]],&lt;ref name="carr1985"&gt;Carr, E.H. – The Bolshevik Revolution 1917–1923. W. W. Norton &amp; Company 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], [[Mensheviks]] and [[anarchists]].&lt;ref name="avrich1968"&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]]. "Russian Anarchists and the Civil War", ''Russian Review'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Jul., 1968), pp. 296–306. [[Blackwell Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some were in support of the [[White Movement]] while some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the [[Russian Civil War]] and after until 1922. In response, the Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the government and suppressed them with force.

=== Theory ===
For "many Marxian libertarian socialists, the political bankruptcy of socialist orthodoxy necessitated a theoretical break. This break took a number of forms. The [[Bordigists]] and the SPGB championed a super-Marxian intransigence in theoretical matters. Other socialists made a return 'behind Marx' to the [[anti-positivist]] programme of [[German idealism]]. Libertarian socialism has frequently linked its anti-authoritarian political aspirations with this theoretical differentiation from orthodoxy.... [[Karl Korsch]]... remained a libertarian socialist for a large part of his life and because of the persistent urge towards theoretical openness in his work. Korsch rejected the eternal and static, and he was obsessed by the essential role of practice in a theory's truth. For Korsch, no theory could escape history, not even Marxism. In this vein, Korsch even credited the stimulus for Marx's ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'' to the movement of the oppressed classes".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt;

In rejecting both capitalism and the state, some libertarian socialists align themselves with anarchists in opposition to both capitalist [[representative democracy]] and to authoritarian forms of [[Marxism]]. Although anarchists and Marxists share an ultimate goal of a stateless society, anarchists criticise most Marxists for advocating a transitional phase under which the state is used to achieve this aim. Nonetheless, libertarian Marxist tendencies such as [[autonomist Marxism]] and [[council communism]] have historically been intertwined with the anarchist movement. Anarchist movements have come into conflict with both capitalist and Marxist forces, sometimes at the same time, as in the [[Spanish Civil War]], though as in that war Marxists themselves are often divided in support or opposition to anarchism. Other political persecutions under bureaucratic parties have resulted in a strong historical antagonism between anarchists and libertarian Marxists on the one hand and [[Leninism|Leninist]] Marxists and their derivatives such as [[Maoism|Maoists]] on the other. However, in recent history libertarian socialists have repeatedly formed temporary alliances with [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] groups in order to protest institutions they both reject. Part of this antagonism can be traced to the [[International Workingmen's Association]], the [[First International]], a congress of [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] workers, where [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (who was fairly representative of anarchist views) and [[Karl Marx]] (whom anarchists accused of being an "authoritarian") came into conflict on various issues. Bakunin's viewpoint on the illegitimacy of the state as an institution and the role of [[electoral politics]] was starkly counterposed to Marx's views in the First International. Marx and Bakunin's disputes eventually led to Marx taking control of the First International and expelling Bakunin and his followers from the organization. This was the beginning of a long-running feud and schism between libertarian socialists and what they call "authoritarian communists", or alternatively just "authoritarians". Some Marxists have formulated views that closely resemble [[syndicalism]] and thus express more affinity with anarchist ideas. Several libertarian socialists, notably [[Noam Chomsky]], believe that anarchism shares much in common with certain variants of Marxism such as the [[council communism]] of Marxist [[Anton Pannekoek]]. In Chomsky's ''[[Notes on Anarchism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1970----.htm Notes on Anarchism]&lt;/ref&gt; he suggests the possibility "that some form of council communism is the natural form of [[revolutionary socialism]] in an [[industrialization|industrial]] society. It reflects the belief that democracy is severely limited when the industrial system is controlled by any form of autocratic elite, whether of owners, managers, and technocrats, a '[[Vanguard party|vanguard' party]], or a State bureaucracy".

=== Postwar ===
[[File:Cornelius Castoriadis.jpg|thumb|[[Cornelius Castoriadis]], theorist of the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]]]
In the mid-20th century, some libertarian socialist groups emerged from disagreements with [[Trotskyism]] which presented itself as Leninist anti-Stalinism. As such, the French group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] emerged from the [[Trotskyist]] [[Fourth International]], where Castoriadis and [[Claude Lefort]] constituted a Chaulieu–Montal Tendency in the French [[Internationalist Communist Party|Parti Communiste Internationaliste]] in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their "final disenchantment with Trotskyism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that "the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German 'left' of the 1920s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the group [[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]] was founded in 1960 by a small group of expelled members of the [[Trotskyist]] [[Socialist Labour League]]. Almost from the start, it was strongly influenced by the French Socialisme ou Barbarie group, in particular by its intellectual leader [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], whose essays were among the many pamphlets Solidarity produced. The intellectual leader of the group was [[Chris Pallis]] (who wrote under the name [[Maurice Brinton]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, Maurice (Goodway, David ed). ''For Workers' Power: the selected writings of Maurice Brinton''. [[AK Press]]. 2004. {{ISBN|1-904859-07-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) since 1967, the terms "[[Ultra-leftism|ultra-left]]" and "left communist" refers to political theory and practice self-defined as further "[[Left-wing politics|left]]" than that of the central [[Maoist]] leaders at the height of the GPCR ("[[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]]"). The terms are also used retroactively to describe some early 20th century [[Chinese anarchist]] orientations. As a slur, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has used the term "ultra-left" more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further "left" than the [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. According to the latter usage, in 1978 the CPC [[Central Committee]] denounced as "ultra-left" the line of [[Mao Zedong]] from 1956 until his death in 1976. Ultra-left refers to those GPCR rebel positions that diverged from the central [[Maoist]] line by identifying an [[antagonistic contradiction]] between the CPC-PRC [[party-state]] itself and the [[Hoi polloi|masses]] of workers and "peasants"&lt;ref&gt;"Peasant (农民)" was the official term for workers on [[people's commune]]s. According to the Ultra-Left, both peasants and (urban) workers together composed a [[proletarian]] [[Social class|class]] divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution.&lt;/ref&gt; conceived as a single proletarian class divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution. Whereas the central Maoist line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the party's mediation, the ultra-left argued that the objective interests of bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however "red" a given bureaucrat's thought might be. Whereas the central Maoist leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary "ideas" and "habits" among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to "turn over a new leaf" after they had undergone "[[Mind control|thought reform]]", the ultra-left argued that cultural revolution had to give way to political revolution "in which one class overthrows another class".&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [http://www.marxists.de/china/sheng/whither.htm "Whither China?"] by Yang Xiguang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 70s Collective, ed. 1996. ''China: The Revolution is Dead, Long Live the Revolution''. Montreal: Black Rose Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of the New Left in the 1950s and 1960s led to a revival of interest in libertarian socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Hahnel]], ''Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation'' Part II {{ISBN|0-415-93344-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Left's critique of the [[Old Left]]'s authoritarianism was associated with a strong interest in personal liberty, [[autonomy]] (see the thinking of [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) and led to a rediscovery of older socialist traditions, such as [[left communism]], [[council communism]] and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The New Left also led to a revival of anarchism. Journals like ''Radical America'' and ''[[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]]'' in the United States, ''[[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]]'', ''[[Big Flame (political group)|Big Flame]]'' and ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'', succeeded by ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/ The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy]. Inclusivedemocracy.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; in the United Kingdom, introduced a range of [[Left-libertarianism|left libertarian]] ideas to a new generation.

In 1969, French [[platformist]] anarcho-communist [[Daniel Guérin]] published an essay called "Libertarian Marxism?" in which he dealt with the debate between Marx and Bakunin at the First International and afterwards suggested that "[l]ibertarian marxism [''sic''] rejects determinism and fatalism, giving the greater place to individual will, intuition, imagination, reflex speeds, and to the deep instincts of the masses, which are more far-seeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings of the 'elites'; libertarian marxism [''sic''] thinks of the effects of surprise, provocation and boldness, refuses to be cluttered and paralysed by a heavy 'scientific' apparatus, doesn't equivocate or bluff, and guards itself from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Libertarian_Marxism_.html |title=Libertarian Marxism? by Daniel Guérin |publisher=Theanarchistlibrary.org |date=2011-04-23 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autonomist Marxism]], [[neo-Marxism]] and [[Situationist International|situationist theory]] are also regarded as being [[anti-authoritarian]] variants of Marxism that are firmly within the libertarian socialist tradition. Related to this were intellectuals who were influenced by Italian left communist [[Amadeo Bordiga]], but who disagreed with his Leninist positions, including [[Jacques Camatte]], editor of the French publication ''Invariance''; and [[Gilles Dauve]], who published ''Troploin'' with Karl Nesic.

Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1993; pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Lenin attacks [[Left communism|left communists]] and [[Council communism|council communists]]]]

=== De Leonism ===
{{main|De Leonism}}
[[De Leonism]], occasionally known as Marxism–De Leonism, is a form of [[syndicalist]] [[Marxism]] developed by [[Daniel De Leon]]. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]]. De Leon combined the rising theories of syndicalism in his time with [[orthodox Marxism]]. According to De Leonist theory, militant [[industrial unions]] are the vehicle of [[class struggle]]. Industrial unions serving the interests of the [[proletariat]] will bring about the change needed to establish a socialist system. The only way this differs from some currents in [[anarcho-syndicalism]] is that—according to De Leonist thinking—a revolutionary political party is also necessary to fight for the proletariat on the political field.

De Leonism lies outside the [[Leninist]] tradition of communism. It predates Leninism as De Leonism's principles developed in the early 1890s with De Leon's assuming leadership of the Socialist Labor Party. Leninism and its [[vanguard party]] idea took shape after the 1902 publication of Lenin's ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]''. The highly [[decentralized]] and [[democracy|democratic]] nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the [[democratic centralism]] of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and what they see as the [[dictatorial]] nature of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other "communist" states. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution.

=== Council communism ===
{{main|Council Communism}}
[[File:AntonPannekoek1908.jpg|thumb|[[Anton Pannekoek]], one of the main theorists of council communism]]
[[Council communism]] was a radical left movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD). Council communism continues today as a theoretical and [[activist]] position within [[Marxism]] and also within libertarian socialism. The central argument of council communism, in contrast to those of [[social democracy]] and Leninist [[communism]], is that [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural and legitimate form of [[working class]] organisation and government power. This view is opposed to the [[reformist]] and [[Bolshevik]] stress on [[Vanguard party|vanguard parties]], [[parliament]]s, or the [[State (polity)|state]].

The core principle of council communism is that the state and the economy should be managed by [[workers' councils]], composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose state-run "bureaucratic socialism". They also oppose the idea of a "revolutionary party", since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party [[dictatorship]]. Council communists support a workers' democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.

The [[Russian language|Russian]] word for council is ''[[Soviet (council)|soviet]]'' and during the early years of the revolution workers' councils were politically significant in Russia. It was to take advantage of the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of workplace power that the word became used by Lenin for various political organs. Indeed, the name [[Supreme Soviet]], which the parliament was called and that of the Soviet Union itself, make use of this terminology, but they do not imply any [[decentralization]].

Furthermore, council communists held a critique of the Soviet Union as a capitalist state, believing that the [[Bolshevik]] revolution in Russia became a [[bourgeois]] revolution when a party bureaucracy replaced the old [[feudal]] [[aristocracy]]. Although most felt the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] was working class in character, they believed that because capitalist relations still existed (i.e. the workers had no say in running the economy) the Soviet Union ended up as a [[state capitalist]] country, with the state replacing the individual capitalist. Thus council communists support workers' revolutions, but oppose one-party dictatorships.

Council communists also believed in diminishing the role of the party to one of [[agitprop|agitation]] and [[propaganda]], rejected all participation in [[elections]] or parliament and argued that workers should leave the reactionary trade unions to form one big, revolutionary union.

=== Left communism ===
{{main|Left communism}}
{{Left communism sidebar|Related}}
[[Left communism]] describes the range of [[Communism|communist]] viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the [[Bolsheviks]] at certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[proletarian]] than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first and during its second congress.

Although she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has heavily influenced most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included [[Amadeo Bordiga]], [[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Otto Rühle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Paul Mattick]].

Prominent [[list of left communist internationals|left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Current]] and the [[International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party]]. Different factions from the old Bordigist [[International Communist Party]] are also considered left communist organizations.

[[File:Wilhelm Reich in his mid-twenties.JPG|thumb|[[Wilhelm Reich]], [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] theorist who wrote the book ''[[Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf|The Sexual Revolution]]'' in 1936]]
Two Marxist and [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian psychoanalytic]] theorists have received the libertarian label or have been associated with it due to their emphasis on anti-authoritarianism and freedom issues.

[[Wilhelm Reich]]&lt;ref&gt;"Wilhelm Reich is again the main pioneer in this field (an excellent, short introduction to his ideas can be found in Maurice Brinton's The Irrational in Politics). In Children of the Future, Reich made numerous suggestions, based on his research and clinical experience, for parents, psychologists, and educators striving to develop libertarian methods of child rearing. (He did not use the term "libertarian," but that is what his methods are.)  Hence, in this and the following sections we will summarise Reich's main ideas as well as those of other libertarian psychologists and educators who have been influenced by him, such as [[A.S. Neill]] and [[Alexander Lowen]]." "J.6 What methods of child rearing do anarchists advocate?" in [[An Anarchist FAQ]] by Various Authors.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In an earlier article (“Some Thoughts on Libertarianism,” Broadsheet No. 35), I argued that to define a position as “anti-authoritarian” is not, in fact, to define the position at all “but merely to indicate a relationship of opposition to another position, the authoritarian one...On the psychoanalytic side, Wilhelm Reich (The Sexual Revolution, Peter Neville-Vision Press, London, 1951| Character Analysis, Orgone Institute Press, N.Y., 1945; and The Function of the Orgasm, Orgone Institute Press, N.Y., 1942) was preferred to Freud because, despite his own weaknesses – his Utopian tendencies and his eventual drift into “orgones” and “bions” – Reich laid more emphasis on the social conditions of mental events than did Freud (see, e.g., A.J. Baker, “Reich's Criticism of Freud,” Libertarian No. 3, January 1960)." "A Reading List for Libertarians" by David Iverson. Broadsheet No. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"I will also discuss other left-libertarians who wrote about Reich, as they bear on the general discussion of Reich's ideas...In 1944, [[Paul Goodman]], author of [[Growing Up Absurd]], [[The Empire City]], and co-author of [[Gestalt Therapy (book)|Gestalt Therapy]], began to discover the work of Wilhelm Reich for his American audience in the tiny libertarian socialist and anarchist milieu." Orgone Addicts: Wilhelm Reich Versus The Situationists. [http://www.lust-for-life.org/Lust-For-Life/ReichVersusTheSituationists/ReichVersusTheSituationists.htm "Orgone Addicts Wilhelm Reich versus the Situationists" by Jim Martin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In the summer of 1950-51, numerous member of the A.C.C. and other interested people held a series of meetings in the Ironworkers' Hall with a view to forming a downtown political society. Here a division developed between a more radical wing (including e.g. Waters and Grahame Harrison) and a more conservative wing (including e.g. Stove and Eric Dowling). The general orientation of these meetings may be judged from the fact that when Harry Hooton proposed "Anarchist" and some of the conservative proposed "Democratic" as the name for the new Society, both were rejected and "Libertarian Society" was adopted as an acceptable title. Likewise then accepted as the motto for this Society - and continued by the later Libertarian society - was the early Marx quotation used by Wilhelm Reich as the motto for his The Sexual Revolution, vis:  "Since it is not for us to create a plan for the future that will hold for all time, all the more surely what we contemporaries have to do is the uncompromising critical evaluation of all that exists, uncompromising in the sense that our criticism fears neither its own results nor the conflict with the powers that be."

(abridged)&lt;/ref&gt; was an Austrian psychoanalyst, a member of the second generation of psychoanalysts after [[Sigmund Freud]] and one of the most radical figures in the history of [[psychiatry]]. He was the author of several influential books and essays, most notably ''[[Character Analysis]]'' (1933), ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' (1933) and ''[[Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf|The Sexual Revolution]]'' (1936).&lt;ref&gt;That he was one of the most radical figures in psychiatry, see [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907256-1,00.html Sheppard 1973].

[[File:Herbert Marcuse in Newton, Massachusetts 1955.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Herbert Marcuse]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]], was an influential [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]] philosopher of the [[New Left]]&lt;ref name=kellner12&gt;Douglas Kellner [http://www.uta.edu/huma/illuminations/kell12.htm Herbert arcuse]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On the other hand, [[Herbert Marcuse]] was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[political philosophy|political theorist]] associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]]. His work ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' (1955) discusses the social meaning of biology—history seen not as a [[class struggle]], but a fight against repression of our instincts. It argues that "advanced industrial society" (modern [[capitalism]]) is preventing us from reaching a non-repressive society "based on a fundamentally different experience of being, a fundamentally different relation between man and nature, and fundamentally different existential relations".&lt;ref&gt;Marcuse, Herbert.'' Eros and Civilization'', 2nd edition. London: Routledge, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; It contends that Freud's argument that repression is needed by [[civilization]] to persist is mistaken as [[Eros (Freud)|Eros]] is liberating and constructive. Marcuse argues that "the irreconcilable conflict is not between work ([[reality principle]]) and Eros (pleasure principle), but between alienated labour (performance principle) and Eros".&lt;ref name=tnm&gt;Young, Robert M. (1969).[http://www.human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/paper89h.html ''THE NAKED MARX: Review of Herbert Marcuse, ''Eros and Civilization: A Philosophical Inquiry into Freud], [[New Statesman]], vol. 78, 7 November 1969, pp. 666-67&lt;/ref&gt; Sex is allowed for "the betters" (capitalists) and for workers only when not disturbing performance. Marcuse believes that a [[socialist]] society could be a society without needing the performance of the poor and without as strong a suppression of our sexual drives—it could replace alienated labor with "non-alienated libidinal work" resulting in "a non-repressive civilization based on 'non-repressive sublimation'".&lt;ref name=tnm/&gt; During the 1960s, Marcuse achieved world renown as "the guru of the New Left", publishing many articles and giving lectures and advice to student radicals all over the world. He travelled widely and his work was often discussed in the mass media, becoming one of the few American intellectuals to gain such attention. Never surrendering his revolutionary vision and commitments, Marcuse continued to his death to defend the Marxian theory and libertarian socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kellner [http://www.uta.edu/english/dab/illuminations/kell12.html "Marcuse, Herbert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207123630/http://www.uta.edu/english/dab/illuminations/kell12.html |date=2012-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialisme ou Barbarie ===
{{main|Socialisme ou Barbarie}}
[[File:Socialisme ou barbarie.JPG|thumb|The journal ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'']]
[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] ("Socialism or Barbarism") was a French-based radical [[libertarian socialist]] group of the post-[[World War II]] period, whose name comes from a phrase Rosa Luxemburg used in her 1916 essay ''The Junius Pamphlet''. It existed from 1948 until 1965. The animating personality was [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], also known as Pierre Chaulieu or Paul Cardan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Howard | first=Dick | title=Introduction to Castoriadis | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23 | page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group originated in the [[Trotskyist]] [[Fourth International]], where Castoriadis and [[Claude Lefort]] constituted a Chaulieu–Montal Tendency in the French [[Internationalist Communist Party|Parti Communiste Internationaliste]] in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their "final disenchantment with Trotskyism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Castoriadis | first=Cornelius | title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23 | page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that "the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German 'left' of the 1920s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Castoriadis | first=Cornelius | title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23 | page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was composed of both intellectuals and workers and agreed with the idea that the main enemies of society were the bureaucracies which governed modern capitalism. They documented and analysed the struggle against that bureaucracy in the group's journal. As an example, the thirteenth issue (January–March 1954) was devoted to the [[East German revolt of June 1953]] and the strikes which erupted amongst several sectors of French workers that summer. Following from the belief that what the working class was addressing in their daily struggles was the real content of socialism, the intellectuals encouraged the workers in the group to report on every aspect of their working lives.

=== Situationist International ===
{{main|Situationist International}}
{{Situationists|Related}}
The [[Situationist International]] (SI) was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957 and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented [[general strike|general]] [[wildcat strikes]] of [[May 1968 in France]].

With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th century European artistic [[avant-garde]]s, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the [[capitalism|capitalist order]], for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose they suggested and experimented with the construction of situations, namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]].

They fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in [[advanced capitalism]]. Their theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]]. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like mass media and advertising have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. To overthrow such a system, the Situationist International supported the May 1968 revolts and asked the workers to [[Council for Maintaining the Occupations|occupy the factories]] and to run them with [[direct democracy]] through [[workers' councils]] composed by instantly revocable delegates.

After publishing in the last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions,&lt;ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra"&gt;''The Beginning of an Era'' ([http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm part1], [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era2.htm part 2]) Situationist International #12, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; the SI was dissolved in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Situationism in a nutshell | author=Karen Elliot | url=http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | publisher=Barbelith Webzine | date=2001-06-01 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solidarity ===
{{main|Solidarity (UK)}}
[[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]] was a small [[libertarian socialist]] organisation from 1960 to 1992 in the [[United Kingdom]]. It published a magazine of the same name. Solidarity was close to [[council communism]] in its prescriptions and was known for its emphasis on workers' self-organisation and for its radical [[anti-Leninism]]. Solidarity was founded in 1960 by a small group of expelled members of the [[Trotskyist]] [[Socialist Labour League]]. It was initially known as Socialism Reaffirmed. The group published a journal, ''Agitator'', which after six issues was renamed ''Solidarity'', from which the organisation took its new name. Almost from the start it was strongly influenced by the French [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] group, in particular by its intellectual leader [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], whose essays were among the many pamphlets Solidarity produced. Solidarity existed as a nationwide organisation with groups in [[London]] and many other cities until 1981, when it imploded after a series of political disputes. The magazine ''Solidarity'' continued to be published by the London group until 1992—other former Solidarity members were behind ''Wildcat'' in [[Manchester]] and ''Here and Now'' magazine in [[Glasgow]]. The intellectual leader of the group was Chris Pallis, whose pamphlets  (written under the name [[Maurice Brinton]]) included ''Paris May 1968'', [http://libcom.org/library/the-bolsheviks-and-workers-control-solidarity-group ''The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control 1917-21''] and [http://libcom.org/library/Irrational-in-politics-Maurice-Brinton The Irrational in Politics].&lt;ref&gt;Now collected in a book, Maurice Brinton, ''For Workers' Power''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other key Solidarity writers were [[Andy Anderson (Solidarity UK)|Andy Anderson]]  (author of [http://libcom.org/library/hungary-56-andy-anderson ''Hungary 1956'']), [[Ken Weller]] (who wrote several pamphlets on industrial struggles and oversaw the group's Motor Bulletins on the car industry), [[Joe Jacobs (Solidarity)|Joe Jacobs]] (''Out of the Ghetto''), [[John Quail]] (''The Slow-Burning Fuse''), [[Phil Mailer]] (''Portugal:The Impossible Revolution'') [[John King (Solidarity UK)|John King]] (''The Political Economy of Marx'', ''A History of Marxian Economics''), George Williamson (writing as James Finlayson, ''Urban Devastation -  The Planning of Incarceration''), David Lamb (''Mutinies'') and [[Liz Willis]] (''Women in the Spanish Revolution'').

=== Autonomism ===
{{main|Autonomism}}
[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Antonio Negri]], main theorist of Italian [[autonomism]]]]
[[Autonomism]] refers to a set of left-wing political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement. As an identifiable theoretical system, it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') communism. Later, post-Marxist and anarchist tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian far-left movements in the 1970s and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', Mario Tronti and [[Paolo Virno]].

Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]].

It influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement|social centre movement]] and today is influential in Italy, France and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The autonomist Marxist and autonomen movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as autonomists. The Italian ''operaismo'' ("workerism") movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]].

=== Communization ===
{{main|Communization}}
[[Communization]] mainly refers to a contemporary [[communist]] theory in which we find is a "mixing-up of [[insurrectionist anarchism]], the [[Left communism|communist ultra-left]], post[[Autonomism|autonomists]], anti-political currents, groups like [[The Coming Insurrection|the Invisible Committee]], as well as more explicitly 'communizing' currents, such as ''Théorie Communiste'' and ''Endnotes''. Obviously at the heart of the word is communism and, as the shift to communization suggests, communism as a particular activity and process".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Noys (ed). [http://www.minorcompositions.info/?p=299 ''Communization and its Discontents: Contestation, Critique, and Contemporary Struggles.''] Minor Compositions, [[Autonomedia]]. 2011. 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of the term communization with a self-identified "[[ultra-left]]" was cemented in France in the 1970s, where it came to describe not a transition to a higher phase of communism, but a vision of communist revolution itself. Thus the 1975 Pamphlet ''A World Without Money'' states that "insurrection and communisation are intimately linked. There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality. The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation itself".

The term is still used in this sense in France today and has spread into English usage as a result of the translation of texts by [[Gilles Dauvé]] and ''Théorie Comuniste'', two key figures in this tendency. However, in the late 1990s a close but not identical sense of "communization" was developed by the French post-situationist group [[Tiqqun]]. In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors, Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with "the revolution" considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities—from squatting and setting up communes to simply "sharing"—that would typically be understood as "pre-revolutionary".&lt;ref&gt;"As we apprehend it, the process of instituting communism can only take the form of a collection of acts of ''communisation'', of making common such-and-such space, such-and-such machine, such-and-such knowledge. That is to say, the elaboration of the mode of sharing that attaches to them. Insurrection itself is just an accelerator, a decisive moment in this process." Anonymous, [http://www.bloom0101.org/call.pdf ''Call''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212804/http://www.bloom0101.org/call.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From an ultra-left perspective such a politics of "dropping-out" or, as Tiqqun put it, "desertion"—setting up spaces and practices that are held to partially autonomous from capitalism—is typically dismissed as either naive or reactionary.&lt;ref&gt;For a critique of Tiqqun from an ultra-left perspective, as well as a description of the opposition between the two sense of "communization" See also Dauvé and Nesic, [http://troploin0.free.fr/ii/index.php/textes/19-communisation-un-appel-et-une-invite "Un Appel et une Invite"].&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the popularity of the Tiqqun-related works ''Call'' and ''[[The Coming Insurrection]]'' in the United States [[anarchist]] circles it tended to be this latter sense of "communization" that was employed in U.S. anarchist and "[[insurrectionist]]" communiques, notably within the [[2009 California college tuition hike protests|Californian student movement of 2009–2010]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://afterthefallcommuniques.info/ "After the Fall: Communiqués from Occupied California"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126222020/http://afterthefallcommuniques.info/ |date=2011-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings within Little Germany date back to the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, developing from 1855.
They are the legacy of merchants from mainland Europe, many of them Jewish,&lt;ref name="trail"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jtrails.org.uk/trails/bradford/places-of-interest |title=Trail → Bradford |publisher=jtrails.org.uk |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who spent large sums of money constructing imposing warehouses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bradfordjewish.org.uk/900-2/ |title=Unknown |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922005523/http://bradfordjewish.org.uk/900-2/ |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the storage and sale of their goods for export. A large proportion of the merchants came from [[Germany]] hence the name '''Little Germany'''.
Bradford became more attractive as a centre of international trade in the aftermath of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], which disrupted commercial relations between France and Germany.

Architectural practices included Milnes &amp; France, [[William_Mawson#Lockwood_and_Mawson|Lockwood &amp; Mawson]], Andrews &amp; Delaunay and J.T. Fairbank building in italianate style. An 1871 building by [[George Corson]] for Scottish clients is in [[Scottish baronial architecture|Scottish baronial style]]. Caspian House (61 East Parade) was built in 1873, as the warehouse of D. Delius and Company; the senior partner in the business was the father of the composer [[Frederick Delius]].

Little Germany is still one of [[Bradford]]'s busiest commercial areas, with over 110 businesses and organisations with 3,000 workers. It attracts around 100,000 visitors each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitbradford.com/thedms.aspx?dms=3&amp;venue=2183380&amp;feature=1 |title=Little Germany |publisher=Visit Bradford |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local authority is currently promoting plans to regenerate the area by renovating and converting the interior of the old mills into housing, hotels, offices, whilst preserving the originally [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] distinctive architecture.

In April 2012 retail giant [[Freemans|Freeman Grattan Holdings]], now a German-owned company, secured a deal to open a new head office and house around 300 staff in a Grade-II-listed former wool warehouse in Little Germany.

Little Germany is also the home of the [[Bradford Playhouse]], which has a mural on the back of the building that commemorates the centenary of the founding of the [[Independent Labour Party]] in Bradford in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/10066 |title=Blue plaque № 10066 in Bradford |publisher=openplaques.org |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==

=== Eastbrook Hall redevelopment ===
[[File:Eastbrook Hall.JPG|thumb|200 px|right|Eastbrook Hall]]
Ham Construction undertook the redevelopment of [[Eastbrook Hall]] in Little Germany. The project cost an estimated £11&amp;nbsp;million and converted the old building into 63 high-quality apartments as well some commercial usage on Leeds Road. The project included a refurbishment of the exterior and roof of the building which suffered extensive fire damage. The hall was built in 1903 and was originally used as a [[Methodism|Methodist]] mission. The redevelopment was being funded through a public private sector funding agreement, as well as the [[The Prince's Regeneration Trust|Prince's Regeneration Trust]]. Work was finally completed in 2008, some months after the original projected finish date was set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://princes-regeneration.org/projects/eastbrook-hall-bradford |title=Eastbrook Hall, Bradford |publisher=The Prince's Regeneration Trust |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Gatehaus ===

[[The Gatehaus]] is an 11-storey glass building recently constructed within the Little Germany district. Construction began in 2005 and was completed in 2007 with a total cost of £22&amp;nbsp;million. The project was originally proposed as a 17-storey landmark but was changed due to a rethink after suggestions that its height was incompatible with the surrounding Victorian buildings. The scheme was developed by Asquith Properties.

The '''long 19th century''' is a term coined for the period between the years 1789 and 1914 by Russian literary critic and author [[Ilya Ehrenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/long-centuries/ |title=Long Centuries |publisher=the-tls.co.uk |date= April 29, 2011  |author= Gasan Gusejnov |accessdate= December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian and author [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. The concept is an adaption of [[Fernand Braudel]]'s 1949 notion of ''le long seizième siècle'' ("the long 16th century" 1450–1640).&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. (1972). The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II
(Vol. 1; S. Reynolds, Trans.). New York: Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; and "a recognized category of [[History of literature|literary history]]", although a period often broadly and diversely defined by different scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slu.edu/Documents/arts_sciences/english/Long%2019th%20Century.pdf |title=Long 19th Century |publisher=slu.edu |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous authors, before and after Hobsbawm's 1995 publication, have applied similar forms of book titles or descriptions to indicate a selective time frame for their works, such as: S. Kettering, "French Society: 1589–1715 –  the long seventeenth century", E. Anthony Wrigley, "British population during the ‘long’ eighteenth century, 1680–1840", or D. Blackbourn, "The long nineteenth century: A history of Germany, 1780–1918".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://treasedademin.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/26032413.pdf |title=French Society: 1589–1715 |publisher=treasedademin |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/wrigley/ |title=Department of Geography, Cambridge » Tony Wrigley – British population during the 'long' eighteenth century, 1680-1840 |publisher=Geog.cam.ac.uk |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=2349 |title=H-Net Reviews - David Blackbourn.

Hobsbawm lays out his analysis in ''[[The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848]]'' (1962), ''[[The Age of Capital: 1848–1875]]'' (1975), and ''[[The Age of Empire: 1875–1914]]'' (1987). Hobsbawn starts his long 19th century with the [[French Revolution]], which sought to establish universal and egalitarian citizenship in France, and ends it with the [[outbreak of World War I]], upon the conclusion of which in 1918 the long-enduring [[European balance of power|European power balance]] of the 19th century proper (1801–1900) was eliminated.  In a sequel to the above-mentioned trilogy, ''[[The Age of Extremes|The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914–1991]]'' (1994), Hobsbawm details [[Short twentieth century|the short 20th century]] beginning with [[World War I]] and ending with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]].

A more generalized version of the long 19th century, lasting from 1750 to 1914, is often used by [[Peter N. Stearns]] in the context of the [[world history]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stearns|first=Peter N.|title=World Civilizations: The Global Experience|year=2011|publisher=[[Longman]]|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-136020-4|edition=6th|author2=Michael Adas|author3=Stuart B. Schwartz|author4=Marc Jason Gilbert|authorlink=Peter Stearns|authorlink2=Michael Adas|authorlink3=Stuart B. Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In religious contexts, specifically those concerning the [[history of the Catholic Church]], the long 19th century was a period of centralization of [[Papacy|papal]] power over the [[Catholic Church]]. This centralization was in opposition to the increasingly centralized nation states and contemporary revolutionary movements and used many of the same organizational and communication techniques as its rivals.  The church's long 19th century extended from the [[French Revolution#Revolution and the Church|French Revolution]] (1789) until the death of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = O'Malley | first = John W. | author-link = John W.

'''Marc Okrand''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|k|ɹ|æ|n|d}}; born July 3, 1948) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[linguist]]. His professional work is in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] languages, and he is well known as the creator of the [[Klingon language]] in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' science fiction franchise.

==Biography==
===Linguistics===
As a linguist, Okrand worked with [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]]. He earned a bachelor's degree from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in 1970.  His 1977 doctoral dissertation from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], was on the grammar of [[Mutsun]], an extinct [[Ohlone languages|Ohlone]] language formerly spoken in the coastal areas of north-central California. His dissertation was supervised by pioneering linguist [[Mary Haas]]. From 1975 to 1978, he taught undergraduate [[linguistics]] courses at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], before taking a [[Postdoctoral research|post-doctoral]] fellowship at the [[Smithsonian]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1978.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124224759995316587 Helping the Hearing Impaired And Voicing the Klingons], May 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

After that, Okrand took a job at the [[National Captioning Institute]], where he worked on the first closed-captioning system for hearing-impaired television viewers. Until his retirement in 2013, Okrand served as one of the directors for Live Captioning at the National Captioning Institute and as President of the board of directors of ''[[WSC Avant Bard]]'' (formerly the Washington Shakespeare Company) in [[Arlington, Virginia]], which planned to stage "an evening of Shakespeare in Klingon" in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/27/AR2010082702649.html Washington Post: How the Washington Shakespeare Company came to offer Shakespeare in Klingon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonshakespeare.org/klingon.pdf WSC press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Star Trek===
While coordinating closed captioning for the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] award show in 1982, Okrand met the producer for the movie ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; His first work was dubbing in [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] language dialogue for ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'', since the actors had already been filmed talking in English. He was then hired by [[Paramount Pictures]] to develop the Klingon language and coach the actors using it in ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'', ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]''. He was later hired for the use of the Romulan and Vulcan languages in the ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film in 2009.&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;{{YouTube|UZmSLc5iTXE|Okrand Answers "What was your involvement in the new Star Trek movie"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also created Klingon dialogue for that movie, but those scenes were cut.&lt;ref name="qepHom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Okrand about Into Darkness| last=Litaer |first=Lieven|date=10 October 2013|url=http://www.qephom.de/e/okrand_about_into_darkness.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', but only during post-production.&lt;ref name="qepHom" /&gt;

Okrand is the author of three books about Klingon – ''[[The Klingon Dictionary]]'' (first published 1985, revised enlarged edition 1992), ''[[The Klingon Way]]'' (1996) and ''[[Klingon for the Galactic Traveler]]'' (1997), as well as two audio-courses: ''[[Conversational Klingon]]'' (1992) and ''[[Power Klingon]]'' (1993).  He has also co-authored the libretto of an opera in the Klingon language: ''&lt;tt&gt;[['u' (opera)|’u’]]&lt;/tt&gt;''{{efn| The title ''’u’'' has three letters-- '''’''' '''u''' '''’''' -- , not one letter between single quotation marks. The apostrophe is a letter in the canonical transcription of [[Klingon language #Writing systems|Klingon orthography]], denoting a [[glottal stop]].}}, debuting at [[The Hague]] in September 2010. The ''tlh'' sound that he incorporated into Klingon, unusual to speakers of English, is common North and Central American indigenous languages, in which it is usually transcribed as ''tl'', ''tł'' or ''ƛ'' (a [[Voiceless alveolar lateral affricate| voiceless alveolar affricate]] with lateral release); this is the sound at the end of the word "[[Nahuatl |Nahua'''tl''']]". He speaks Klingon, but notes that others have attained greater fluency.&lt;ref name="Rogers" &gt;{{cite news|title=ghom &lt;!-- see [[Talk:Marc Okrand#ghom|Talk]] --&gt; tlhIngan Hol lujatlhbogh ghotpu’: Translation: People who speak Klingon meet |last=Rogers |first=Tony| date=7 March 2011| journal= Arbiter Online: Boise State's Independent Student Media| url= http://arbiteronline.com/2011/03/07/linguists-in-hollywood-brings-pizazz-to-boise-state/|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Okrand created another fictional language: [[Atlantean language |Atlantean]], for the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]],'' for which he was also used as an early facial model for the protagonist's character design.

'''Michele Amari''' (7 July 1806 – 16 July 1889) was an Italian patriot and historian.

==Biography==
Born at [[Palermo, Italy|Palermo]] son of Ferdinando and Giulia Venturelli, he devoted a great part of his life to the history of [[Sicily]]. Amari was also an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]], who investigated  the true character of the [[Sicilian Vespers]]. He also served as the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s first [[Ministry of Public Education (Italy)|minister of public education]].

Amari became an important figure during the [[Risorgimento]]. A liberal republican and [[carbonari]]st, who after the fall of [[Joachim Murat]] supported Sicilian secession.  He became a link between Prime Minister [[Camillo Benso di Cavour]] and influential Sicilians, helping to convince them to support [[Italian unification]]. Amari did so expecting Cavour to grant Sicily some regional autonomy after unification.

He died at [[Florence]] in 1889.

==Works==
Amari's historical works focus on Medieval Sicilian history, including extensive works on the period of [[Muslim]] control. His efforts have earned him acknowledgment as one of 19th century Europe's premier translators of Medieval [[Arabic]] writings. His ''Storia dei Musulmani di Sicilia'' (History of the Muslims of Sicily, 1854) has been translated into many languages, including Arabic by a group of Egyptian scholars in 2004.

His translation from an arabic manuscript of a [[mirror for princes]] text, including a biography of its author, the medieval Sicilian Arab [[Ibn Zafar al Siqilli]], was published in 1851.  Richard Bentley translated Amari's Italian translation of this 12th century work by the so-called "[[Machiavelli| Machiavelli precursor]]" into English and published it under the title ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort'' in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/solwanorwatersof01ibnz Amari, Michele ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort by Ibn Zafer'', Vol.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/solwanorwatersof02ibnz Amari, Michele ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort by Ibn Zafer'', Vol.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''N-Town Plays''' (also called the '''Hegge Cycle''' and the '''Ludus Coventriae cycle''') are a cycle of 42 medieval [[Mystery play]]s from between 1450 and 1500.

==The manuscript==
The manuscript is now housed in the British Library, London (BL MS [[Cotton Vespasian]] D.8). As its name might suggest, though, it was once the property of the 17th-century antiquarian [[Sir Robert Bruce Cotton]] and was housed in his large library. Cotton's librarian, [[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]], quickly examined the manuscript and erroneously assumed that it contained the Biblical plays performed in Coventry during the 15th and 16th centuries, thus naming them the '''Ludus Coventriae''' or "the Play Called Corpus Christi".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.ox.ac.uk/Old%20Site/lists/NTown06.pdf Medieval English Drama&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was mistaken in both cases, but that mistake has proven very difficult to correct; the name Ludus Coventriae persists in the secondary and critical literature well into the 20th century. A further complication of the N-Town plays was made by [[Hardin Craig]] who, in his ''Medieval Drama'' (1955), called the collection the '''Hegge Plays''' after their former owner, [[Robert Hegge]]. The name Hegge Plays only briefly caught on, and the most common way to refer to these plays now is The N-Town Plays, after the reference in the last stanza of the opening proclamation that the play was to be played at "N-Town"; when the plays toured from town to town, N. (meaning nomen, the Latin for name) would be replaced by the name of the town the cycle was playing in at any given time.

[[Image:04b266 adamandeve.jpg|thumb|left|Adam and Eve are expelled from Paradise in 'The Fall of Man' from the N-Town plays, as performed by the Players of St Peter in [[St Clement Eastcheap]],London in 2004]]

The plays of the N-Town cycle vary from simple, almost liturgical, recitations of Biblical texts (as in the Moses play of the Ten Commandments, the Jesse play with its kings and prophets, and the Penetecost play) to highly complex and fast moving short dramas on Biblical themes that have a naturalism and liveliness (as in the Death of Herod and the Woman Taken in Adultery) almost unique in early drama. These plays can all be played from a wagon or a single booth stage. On the other hand, the two Mary Plays and the Passion Play were written for what is often called "place and scaffold" production in the round using "scaffolds" or raised stages and also the "platea" or the "place" between the stages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ajohnsto/intront.html Introduction to N-Town&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The true nature of the manuscript has been hidden by the fact that the scribe arranged all the episodes in "chronological order" starting with Creation and ending with Judgment, simulating an episodic play presenting salvation history as in the two northern civic cycles from York and Chester. As he did this he buried the Mary Play inside the Nativity sequence and copied the Passion Play into place between the Raising of Lazarus and the Resurrection appearances. It has taken painstaking paleographic and codicologic examinations of the manuscript to determine what the scribe actually did. To further complicate the matter, at some point in the history of copying out these plays, the proclamation was attached to them. Although the proclamation does not match the plays that follow, someone, possibly the scribe of this manuscript, placed numbers in the margin of the text against incidents that correspond to the description of the "pageants" in the proclamation. This does not affect the single episode pageants but it breaks up the flow of the Passion Play and has obscured the very existence of the Mary Play for centuries.

A final scribal feature of this manuscript is the stage directions which reflect a curious mixture of intent. They seem to be recording performance detail while, at the same time, facilitating the reading of the manuscript as a meditation text rather than using it as a text to be enacted. The stage directions are in Latin in the pageants, in the Mary Play they are a mix of English and Latin and in the Passion Play they are almost entirely in English. They seem to function as much as an aid to help a reader visualise the action as actual practical instructions to a director. The details of costume and action in the stage directions in the Passion Play suggest a description of an actual performance. The liturgical music is specified in the Mary Play and Assumption Play by including the opening words of each piece or the "incipit" in the stage directions. On the other hand, the stage directions in many of the pageants are quite laconic.

==Location==
All scholars who have worked with this manuscript agree that it belongs in the east Midlands. Some attempt has been made to place it as far north as [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] (it was even called the [[Lincoln Mystery Plays|Lincoln cycle]] by some scholars for a period and is still performed in the shadow of [[Lincoln Cathedral]]), but the general consensus places the manuscript in [[East Anglia]]. Stephen Spector cautiously writes "The linguistic evidence indicates that the codex was recorded principally or exclusively by scribes trained in East Anglia" (Spector, xxix)&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Stephen (ed). ''The N-Town Play''. 2 vols. EETS S.S. 11–12, 1991; p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Meredith more positively asserts that The Mary Play comes from Norfolk (Meredith, 6).&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, Peter (ed). ''The Mary Play (from N-Town)''. London, Longmans, 1987; p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the eclectic nature of the MS. has been recognised, scholars have been hesitant to insist that all the plays copied into this anthology were played in the same place.

==Date==
The date "1468" appears in the hand of the major scribe at the end of the Purification play (f 100v). This, then, is the earliest possible date for the copying of the text. Spector has concluded on the basis of dialectal evidence that the plays cannot predate 1425 and on the basis of the watermarks on the paper that the paper used by the main scribe comes from the period 1460–77. It is possible, again on the basis of the paper, that the Assumption play, written separately by a different scribe and bound into the main MS., was copied slightly earlier. We are safe to assume that the MS. dates from the second half of the third quarter (ca. 1463–75) of the 15th century. This makes it the oldest MS. to contain a large number of Biblical plays. Although we know there were plays performed elsewhere from the late 14th century, the York manuscript was written down in the 1470s, the [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Towneley MS.]] after the turn of the 16th century and all the versions of the Chester plays after 1596.

==Sources of the plays==
The majority of the plays that make up the N-Town Cycle are based (some rather tenuously) on the Bible, while the others are taken from Roman Catholic legend, apocryphal sources and folk tradition.  The Marian plays place a strong emphasis on the early life of the Virgin, as well as on the relationship between her and Joseph (which plays heavily upon the popular medieval old man with a younger wife trope).  The Trial of Mary and Joseph play has been identified as a pastiche of the East Anglian ecclesiastical court system.

'''Naaran''' (also '''Na'aran''') ({{lang-he-n|נערן}}) is an ancient [[Jew]]ish village dating to the 5th and 6th century CE, located in the [[West Bank]]. Remains of the village have been excavated north of [[Jericho]], in [[Mount Ephraim|Ephraim]], between [[Bethel]] and Jericho. The mosaic floor of a [[synagogue]] was discovered at the site featuring a large [[zodiac]] design. Naaran is mentioned in [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 7:28 as a town in the eastern part of Ephraim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd264.htm Easton's Bible Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]], in his ''Onomasticon'', makes mention of the site, saying that in his day it was "a village inhabited by Jews, five miles from Jericho."&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Onomasticon - The Place Names of Divine Scripture'', (ed.) R. Steven Notley &amp; [[Ze'ev Safrai]], Brill: Leiden 2005, p. 130 (§732) {{ISBN|0-391-04217-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is also named in the writings of Josephus (''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' 17.13.1), under its name ({{lang-gr|Νεαρὰν}}), and in the [[Midrash Rabba]] (Leviticus Rabba 23:5). Aramaic inscriptions and mosaics from the synagogue are displayed at an archaeology museum established by the [[Israel]]i archaeologist Yitzhak Magen at the Good Samaritan Inn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=38&amp;Issue=1&amp;ArticleID=8 Inn of the Good Samaritan Becomes a Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2012, the ancient synagogue was vandalized with graffiti that included swastikas and Palestinian flags.&lt;ref name=Ynet&gt;{{cite news |title=Swastikas sprayed on ancient synagogue near Jericho|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4234201,00.html|author=Itamar Fleishman |date=25 May 2012|work=Ynetnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel's Public Diplomacy Minister [[Yuli-Yoel Edelstein]] condemned the act and noted that, "The incident reaffirms the belief that Jewish holy sites must be under Israel's sovereignty."&lt;ref name=Ynet/&gt;

An [[Israeli settlement]], [[kibbutz]] [[Niran]], located several kilometers to the north, takes its name from Naaran.

'''New Age Orientalism''' describes a modern, Western perception of [[Tibet]], and other Asian majority countries. The term was coined by, [[Tibetology|Tibetologist]] [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Donald Swell Lopez Jr.]], who specializes in Western discourse on [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopez Jr|first=Donald Sewell|date=1994|title=New age orientalism: the case of Tibet|url=|journal=Tricycle: The Buddhist Journal|volume=3|pages=36–43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lsa.umich.edu/asian/people/faculty/dlopez.html|title=Donald S. Lopez Jr. {{!}} U-M LSA Asian Languages and Cultures|website=lsa.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tibetologist is a person who studies [[tibetology]], the study of things related to [[Tibet]], including its [[History of Tibet|history]], [[Tibetan Buddhism|religion]], [[Standard Tibetan|language]], politics and the collection of Tibetan articles of historical, cultural and religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tibetology|date=2018-06-27|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tibetology&amp;oldid=847768940|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tibet]] is a [[historical region]] covering much of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] in Central Asia. It is the traditional homeland of the [[Tibetan people]] as well as some other [[Ethnic group|ethnic groups]] such as [[Monpa people|Monpa]], [[Qiang people|Qiang]], and [[Lhoba people|Lhoba peoples]] and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of [[Han Chinese]] and [[Hui people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tibet|date=2018-08-27|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tibet&amp;oldid=856854724|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=='''Orientalism on Tibet'''==

[[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Dr. Donald S. Lopez Jr.]] studied the depiction of Tibet in Western academic writing throughout history. He found that, before the New Age movement, the depiction of Tibet was often cynical and derogatory. The demeaning features that define Orientalism, characterized the portrayal of Tibet, before the emergence of New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Self-aggrandizing of the Orient ===
In line with the logic of opposites, members of Western academia stressed their superiority (particularly regarding their academic abilities) and used this as a justification to patronize the Orient. With the modern period came Colonialism, when new knowledge of the Eastern world sparked western scholars to write about foreign histories, cultures, and traditions, despite having a sparse and incomplete understanding of them. The Western world, a majority of which was engaging in colonialism, considered The Eastern world to be incapable of representing itself due to its non-western mechanisms of knowledge. The colonial philosophy of manifest destiny led western scholars to believe that they had a more civilized and valuable way of expression, and so western academics took it upon themselves to document societies, such as Tibet, from their perspectives. Often described as 'backward' or 'incapable,' particularly in self-governance, such portrayals helped to fuel racist and white supremacist beliefs of Asian peoples across the west. Such western scholars considered both China and Tibet to be “Oriental Despotisms,” to which the politically organized and colonizing Western world was meant to civilize. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Gaining and justifying authority ===
[[Manifest destiny]], along with larger ideologies of [[racism]] and [[white supremacy]], were used as a method of justifying imperialism and colonialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Eve|date=2016|title=Orientalist commercializations: Tibetan Buddhism in American popular film|url=https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1852&amp;amp=&amp;context=jrf&amp;amp=&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=https%253A%252F%252Fscholar.google.de%252Fscholar%253Fhl%253Dde%2526as_sdt%253D0%25252C5%2526q%253D%252522new%252Bage%252BOrientalism%252522%252Bmullen%2526oq%253Dmull#search=%22new%20age%20Orientalism%20mullen%22|journal=Journal of Religion &amp; Film|volume=2.2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When control of Tibet was taken by western forces for periods of time, western understandings of self-superiority helped to fuel the sense of entitlement, which explained such [[Colonialism|colonial violence]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

However, western powers never fully succeeded in gaining imperial control of Tibet, despite [[British expedition to Tibet|Britain]] and [[Foreign relations of Tibet#Russia and The Great Game|Russia's]] considerable military efforts. According to a western-centric understanding, Tibet never [[Modernization theory|modernized,]] refusing to adopt European-style education systems or norms. Throughout the course of the 19th and 20th century, Tibet remained inaccessible to Western powers, and was therefore predominantly portrayed as isolated, closed, and uncivilized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=='''New Age Orientalism and Tibet'''==

Embedded in the [[New Age|New Age movement]], New Age Orientalism describes the positive Western perception of old Tibet (before the [[Chinese invasion of Tibet|Chinese invasion 1950]] and [[Tibetan diaspora|Tibetan diaspora 1959)]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This portrayal of Tibet in the modern Western Societies, has been criticized for romanticizing old Tibetan reality and neglecting negative aspects of its society, such as, violence or the clerical, feudal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDuqayOx2Nw|title=Colin Goldner: Hinter dem Lächeln des Dalai Lama (Vortrag Univ. Wien 18.05.2012)|last=Goldner|first=Colin|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, seen as a construct of Western fantasy, rather than a depiction of reality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The myth of Shangri-La: Tibet, travel writing, and the western creatio of sacred landscape.|last=Bishop|first=Peter|publisher=Univ of California Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anand|first=Dibyesh|date=|title=Strategic hypocrisy: The British imperial scripting of Tibet's geopolitical identity|url=|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=68(1)|pages=227–252|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

New Age Orientalism, subsequently, describes the [[Orientalism|orientalist]] perception of Tibet, in which Tibet is no longer depreciated but, rather, romanticized. It is based on the tradition of continued [[Romantic Orientalism]], “in which the ‘West’ perceives some lack within itself and fantasizes that the answer, through a process of projection, is to be found somewhere in the ‘East.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this manner, the four characteristics of Orientalism persist with slight variation. The logic of opposites, now relates to the old Tibet and China. Tibet is no longer perceived as an antiquated, "oriental despotism," but as a [[Shangri-La]] -- positive, holy, pristine, and pure, which is perceived as incorrupt, since it was never dominated by the West. The Chinese constitute the opposite, as the evil, subhuman force invading the land of peaceful, devoted inhabitants. The old Tibetan culture seems removed from time and history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This allows the West to aggrandize themselves as rescuers of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism (see [[Free Tibet|'Free Tibet']] movement), whereas, [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] are depicted as helpless and voiceless. Ultimately, the West again finds itself in a patronizing position, representing another culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== New Age Orientalism in popular culture ===

The romanticized picture of Tibet has, partly, been constructed and reflected by [[popular culture]]. Hollywood movies such as [[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven years in Tibet]], [[Kundun]], and [[Little Buddha]], were found to draw a [[Romanticism|romanticized]] image of Tibet, and hold up the Western rescue paradigm, in line with the play of opposites, between China and Tibet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, publications surrounding the '[[Free Tibet]]' movement have been categorized as New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The constructed fantasies of a Shangri-La Tibet, are found to reflect back on the Western struggles, within their own national identity,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as well as, pitfalls of [[Globalization|globalization]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
=='''Expansion of New Age Orientialism'''==

In academic literature, the concept of New Age Orientalism, originally relating to Tibet, has been expanded and applied to other cultures and religions, such as [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt; The discourse and perception on [[Ayurveda]], for instance, has been categorized as New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;

=='''Criticism of New Age Orientialism'''==

Dr. Donald Lopez's concept of New Age Orientalism, has been criticized for placing too much weight on the impact and power of Orientalism, and viewing Tibet as a closed totality, removed from history. Alternatives to Orientalism are not considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreyfus|first=Georges|date=2005|title=Are We Prisoners of Shangrila?

[[File:Franklin 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Five-time Olympic gold medalist [[Missy Franklin]] (of USA) in a one-piece swimsuit.]]

A '''one-piece swimsuit''' most commonly refers to [[swimwear]] worn by women and girls when [[human swimming|swimming]] in the sea or in a swimming pool, or for any activity in the sun, such as [[sun bathing]]. Today, the one-piece swimsuit is usually a [[skin-tight garment]] that covers a [[female]]'s [[torso]], except maybe the back or upper chest.

Before the popularity of the two-piece swimsuit, and then the bikini, virtually all female swimwear completely covered at least the wearer's torso, and men also wore similar swimsuits. While the bikini has increasingly found popular acceptance since the 1960s, the one-piece swimsuit has maintained a place on beaches to this day. Some people consider a one-piece swimsuit to be more [[Modesty|modest]] than a two-piece [[bikini]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com|title=Swimsuits have changed over the past 100 years|last=Bahou|first=Olivia|date=May 11, 2015|website=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/news|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some situations, the wearing of a one-piece swimsuit may be mandatory or expected, as in the case of school swimming events and international swimming events.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The most common type of one-piece suit is the [[maillot]] (a term that is not generally used any more) or ''tank suit'', which resembles a sleeveless [[leotard]] or [[bodysuit]]. There are variants of the one-piece swimsuit, including [[halterneck]] styles and plunge front swimsuits, as well as wrap-round ("surplice") and [[bandeau]] styles. The [[pretzel suit]] is another style of the one-piece swimsuit. Recently, athletic swimsuits have used a variety of new shoulder strap styles, including the [[racerback]], fastback, and flyback styles, some of which have also been used on other athletic wear. Another recent innovation in one-piece swimsuits is the [[bodyskin]], which superficially resembles a [[unitard]] or [[wetsuit]]. Although these cover the entire torso, arms and legs, their function is not modesty, but reducing friction through the water for professional swimmers. Their surfaces are made of textured technical fabrics which are engineered to cut through the water in the same way as fish or shark skin.

==History==
[[File:Annette Kellerman.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Annette Kellerman]] in the form-fitting one-piece [[Maillot|tank suit]] that got her arrested in 1907]]
{{main|History of swimwear}}
The modern one-piece swimsuit made its appearance in the mid-1900s, when the style was widely described as a [[maillot]]. Its widespread acceptance is attributed to [[Australia]]n swimmer [[Annette Kellerman]], who attracted further attention to the style when, in 1907, she was arrested on a [[Boston]] beach for [[indecent exposure]] because her swimsuit showed arms, legs and the neck, a costume she adopted from England,&lt;ref name=claud&gt;Claudia B. Kidwell, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/37586/37586-h/37586-h.htm Women's Bathing and Swimming Costume in the United States]'', Smithsonian Institution Press, City of Washington, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and which was similar to men's swimsuits of the time. The arrest prompted a wide public outrage which added to the acceptance of the style. Kellerman marketed these bathing suits and the style came to be known as "the Annette Kellerman". The one-piece swimsuit became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910,&lt;ref&gt;Liz Conor, ''The spectacular modern woman: feminine visibility in the 1920s'', page 152, Indiana University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-253-34391-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other places, and was the authorised attire for women's swimming at the [[Swimming at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Summer Olympics]], the first at which women competed.

''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' praised the Kellerman swimsuit, writing in June 1920 (vol. 55, no. 6, p.&amp;nbsp;138) - "Annette Kellerman Bathing Attire is distinguished by an incomparable, daring beauty of fit that always remains refined." The following year, in June 1921 (vol. 54, no. 2504, p.&amp;nbsp;101) it wrote that these bathing suits were "famous ... for their perfect fit and exquisite, plastic beauty of line."&lt;ref name=claud/&gt; In the United States, [[beauty pageant]]s of women in bathing costumes became popular from the 1880s. However, such events were not regarded as  respectable. Beauty contests became more respectable with the first modern "[[Miss America]]" contest held in 1921, though less respectable beauty contests continued to be held. Nevertheless, the Annette Kellerman continued to be considered by some as the most offensive style of swimsuit in the 1920s and became the focus of censorship efforts.&lt;ref name="www1.assumption.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.assumption.edu/ahc/vanities/default.html |title=Vanities |publisher=.assumption.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hess&gt;{{cite web|author=Meagan Hess |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma04/hess/fashion/inthiscorner3.html |title=Skirting the Skirts at the Bathing Beach |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in 1943, pictures of the Kellerman swimsuit were produced as evidence of indecency in ''Esquire v. Walker, Postmaster General''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/55/1015/2312641/ Esquire, Inc. v. Walker, Postmaster General], 55 F. Supp. 1015: Esquire v. Walker, District Of Columbia District Court - 55 F. Supp. 1015, July 15, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Preer, "[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1990/spring/esquire-v-walker-3.html The Postmaster General and ''The Magazine for Men'']", ''Prologue Magazine'', page 3, Spring 1990, Vol. 23, No. 1, U.S. National Archives and Records Administration&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eco-Panda Show (3638065270).jpg|thumb|upright|A modern one-piece swimwear with cutouts]]

During the 1920s and 1930s, people began to shift from "taking in the water" to "taking in the sun," at bathhouses and spas, and swimsuit designs shifted from functional considerations to incorporate more decorative features. [[Rayon]] was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight-fitting swimsuits,&lt;ref name=sydelle&gt;{{cite web|last=Sydelle|first=John|title=The Swimsuit Industry|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/swimsuit-industry-18779.html |work=The Houston Chronicle |accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its durability, especially when wet, proved problematic,&lt;!-- Rayon also had the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Kadolph"&gt;{{cite book|title=Textiles|edition=9|author1=Kadolph, Sara J.  |author2=Langford, Anna L. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=0-13-025443-6|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] and [[silk]] also sometimes being used.&lt;ref name=glamoursurf&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage Swimwear Timeline|url=http://www.glamoursurf.com/swimwear_timeline.html|publisher=Glamoursurf.com|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s the necklines of women's swimwear plunged at the back, sleeves disappeared and sides were cut away and tightened. With the development of new clothing materials, particularly [[latex]] and [[nylon]], through the 1930s&lt;!--1934 is too specific a date--&gt; swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning.&lt;ref name=carnival&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/bikini/#In%20Brazil |title=History of the Bikini |publisher=Carnival}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the 1960s, the [[bikini]] has increasingly found popular acceptance, though the one-piece swimsuit has maintained a place on beaches to this day. [[Jacques Heim|Heim's]] two-piece has fallen out of fashion. In some contexts till today, a two-piece swimsuit is still regarded by some as immodest and controversial, with a one-piece bathing suit being mandatory, as in the case of most school swimming events.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Olympic women's swimming and other international swimming events still prohibit the wearing of two-piece swimsuits.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

'''Peter G. Rose''' (born 25 February 1939) is an American author and food historian.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/13/garden/a-food-historian-works-to-give-the-dutch-their-due.html&lt;/ref&gt; She has published 8 books, mainly on the topic of food in colonial times, especially among the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] in the [[Hudson Valley]].

'''Rebecca Newberger Goldstein''' (born February 23, 1950) is an American [[philosopher]], novelist and [[public intellectual]]. She has written ten books, both fiction and nonfiction. Her Princeton Ph.D. was in [[philosophy of science]], and she is sometimes grouped with novelists, such as [[Richard Powers]] and [[Alan Lightman]], who create fiction that is knowledgeable of, and sympathetic toward, science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/15/arts/design/15LIGH.html|title=Art That Transfigures Science|first=Alan|last=Lightman|date=15 March 2003|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her three nonfiction works she has shown an affinity for philosophical [[rationalism]], as well as a conviction that philosophy, like science, makes progress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Is-Philosophy-Obsolete-/145837|title=How Philosophy Makes Progress|first=Rebecca Newberger|last=Goldstein|date=14 April 2014|publisher=|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that scientific progress is itself supported by philosophical arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/19/rebecca-newberger-goldstein-interview-science-philosophy-plato-googleplex|title=Rebecca Newberger Goldstein: 'Science is our best answer, but it takes a philosophical argument to prove that'|first=Andrew|last=Anthony|date=19 October 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also stressed the role that secular philosophical reason has made in moral advances.

Increasingly, in her talks and interviews, she has been exploring what she has called "mattering theory" as an alternative to traditional utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php/articles/3769|title=Feminism, Religion, and 'Mattering'|website=www.secularhumanism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehumanist.com/magazine/september-october-2014/features/the-machinery-of-moral-progress-an-interview-with-rebecca-newberger-goldstein|title=The Machinery of Moral Progress: An Interview with Rebecca Newberger Goldstein - TheHumanist.com|date=27 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory is a continuation of her idea of "the mattering map", first suggested in her novel ''The Mind-Body Problem''. The concept of the mattering map has been widely adopted in contexts as diverse as cultural criticism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grossberg|first1=Lawrence|title=We Gotta Get Out of This Place: Popular Conservatism and Postmodern Culture|date=1992|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grossberg|first1=Lawrence|title=Cultural Studies in the Future Tense|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kashak|first1=Ellyn|title=The Mattering Map: Integrating The Complexities of Knowledge, Experience and Meaning|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|date=2013|volume=37|issue=4|pages=436–443|doi=10.1177/0361684313480839}}&lt;/ref&gt; and behavioral economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loewenstein, Meine|first1=G., K|title="On Mattering Maps" in Understanding Choice, Explaining Behavior: Essays in Honour of Ole-Jørgen Skog, Jon Elster, Olav Gjelsvik, Aanund Hylland and Karl Moene (Eds.)|publisher=Oslo Academic Press|location=Oslo, Norway|pages=153–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein is a MacArthur Fellow and has received the [[National Humanities Medal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/national-humanities-medals/rebecca-newberger-goldstein|title=Rebecca Newberger Goldstein|date=2 September 2015|website=National Endowment for the Humanities}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Jewish Book Award, and numerous other honors.

==Early life and education==
Goldstein, born Rebecca Newberger, grew up in [[White Plains, New York]], and did her undergraduate work at [[City College of New York]], [[UCLA]], and [[Barnard College]], where she graduated as [[valedictorian]] in 1972. She was born into an [[Orthodox Jewish]] family. She has one older brother, who is an Orthodox [[rabbi]], and a younger sister, Sarah Stern. An older sister, Mynda Barenholtz, died in 2001.

==Career==
After earning her Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]], where she studied with [[Thomas Nagel]] and wrote a dissertation titled "Reduction, Realism and the Mind," she returned to Barnard as a professor of philosophy. There she published her first novel, ''[[The Mind-Body Problem]]'' (1983), a serio-comic tale of the conflict between emotion and intelligence, combined with reflections on the nature of mathematical genius, the challenges faced by intellectual women, and Jewish tradition and identity. Goldstein said she wrote the book to "...insert 'real life' intimately into the intellectual struggle. In short I wanted to write a philosophically motivated novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rebeccagoldstein.com/Goldstein_bio.htm|title=Rebecca Goldstein web site|accessdate=2006-11-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212223302/http://www.rebeccagoldstein.com/Goldstein_bio.htm#|archive-date=2006-12-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second novel, ''The Late-Summer Passion of a Woman of Mind'' (1989), was also set in [[academia]], though with a far darker tone. Her third novel, ''The Dark Sister'' (1993), was something of a departure: a [[postmodern]] fictionalization of family and professional issues in the life of [[William James]]. She followed it with a short-story collection, ''Strange Attractors'' (1993), which was a National Jewish Honor Book and [[New York Times]] Notable Book of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rebeccagoldstein.com/publications/strange-attractors-stories|title=Strange Attractors: Stories|first=Rebecca|last=Goldstein|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fictional mother, daughter, and granddaughter introduced in two of the stories in that collection became the main characters of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lore |last=Dickstein|title=World of Our Mothers|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=October 29, 1995 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/29/books/world-of-our-mothers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein's next novel, ''Mazel'' (1995), which won the [[National Jewish Book Award]] and the 1995 [[Edward Lewis Wallant Award]].

A [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 1996 led to the writing of ''Properties of Light'' (2000), a ghost story about love, betrayal, and [[quantum physics]]. Her most recent novel is ''36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction'' (2010), which explores ongoing controversies over religion and reason through the tale of a professor of psychology who has written an atheist bestseller while his life is permeated with secular versions of religious themes such as messianism, divine genius, and the quest for immortality. The book has a long nonfiction appendix (attributed to the novel's protagonist) that details 36 traditional and modern arguments for the existence of God together with their claimed refutations. The book was chosen by [[National Public Radio]] as one of the "five favorite books of 2010"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Heller |last=McAlpin|title=People Are Talking About These Five Books|date=November 23, 2010|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/15/131356105/people-are-talking-about-these-five-books|work=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[The Christian Science Monitor]] as the best book of fiction of 2010.&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/2010/1201/Best-books-of-2010-fiction/36-Arguments-for-the-Existence-of-God-by-Rebecca-Newberger-Goldstein|title=Best books of 2010: fiction|first=Marjorie Kehe, Monitor book|last=editor|date=1 December 2010|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein has written two [[biography|biographical]] studies: ''Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Gödel'' (2005) and ''Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew Who Gave Us Modernity'' (2006). ''Betraying Spinoza'' combined her continuing interest in Jewish ideas, history, and identity with an increasing focus on [[secularism]], [[humanism]], and [[atheism]]. Goldstein has described the book, which combines elements of memoir, biography, history, and philosophical analysis, as "the eighth book I'd published, but [the] first in which I took the long-delayed and irrevocable step of integrating my private and public selves.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rebecca Newberger Goldstein|title=Flourishing in the Company of Like-Minded People|work= The Humanist|date= December 22, 2015 |url=http://thehumanist.com/magazine/january-february-2016/features/flourishing-company-like-minded-people#.VnnLsvqZx2I.twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with ''36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction'' it established her as a prominent figure in the humanist movement, part of a wave of "new new atheists" marked by less divisive rhetoric and a greater representation of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Atheists — naughty and nice — should define themselves | url=http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2010/02/02/atheists-naughty-and-nice-should-define-themselves/2536 | authorlink=Susan Jacoby | work=The Washington Post | first=Susan |  last=Jacoby}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 she was named "Humanist of the Year" by the [[American Humanist Association]] and "Freethought Heroine" by the [[Freedom from Religion Foundation]].

In 2014, she published ''Plato at the Googleplex: Why Philosophy Won't Go Away'', an exploration of the historical roots and contemporary relevance of philosophy. The book alternates between expository chapters on the life and ideas of Plato in the context of ancient Greece and modern dialogues in which Plato is brought to life in the 21st century, and demonstrates the relevance of philosophy by arguing with contemporary figures such as a software engineer at Google headquarters, a right-wing talk show host, an affective neuroscientist, and others.

In addition to Barnard, Goldstein has taught at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], and [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and since 2014 she has been &lt;ref&gt;Sage Center for the Study of the Mind, "[http://www.sagecenter.ucsb.edu/distinguished-fellows/2013-2014 Distinguished Fellows for 2013-2014]"&lt;/ref&gt; a visiting professor at the [[New College of the Humanities]] in London. In 2016 she was a Visiting Professor in the Department of English at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[New York University]]|title= "Rebecca Newberger Goldstein Named 2014 National Humanities Medal Recipient|date=September 3, 2015 |url=http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/09/03/rebecca-newberger-goldstein-named-2014-national-humanities-medal-recipient.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has held visiting fellowships at the [[Radcliffe Institute]],  [[Brandeis University]], the [[Santa Fe Institute]], [[Yale University]], and [[Dartmouth College]]. In 2011, she delivered the [[Tanner Lectures on Human Values]] at Yale University, titled "The Ancient Quarrel: Philosophy and Literature." She serves on the Council on Values of the [[World Economic Forum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/content/global-agenda-council-values-2014-2016-0|title=Global Future Councils|website=World Economic Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and serves on the Advisory Board of the [[Secular Coalition for America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.secular.org/board Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein's writing has been published not only in her books but also in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rebeccagoldstein.com/publications?page=2|title=Articles, Chapters &amp; Stories - Rebecca Newberger Goldstein|website=www.rebeccagoldstein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; chapters in a number of edited books, and in journals including ''[[The Atlantic]], [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]], [[The New York Times Book Review]], [[The New York Review of Books]], [[The New Republic]], [[The Wall Street Journal]], [[Huffington Post]], [[Tikkun (magazine)]], [[Commentary (magazine)]]'', and in blog format in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' "On Faith" section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/author/rebecca-goldstein |title=Rebecca Goldstein |work=www.faithstreet.com|accessdate=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Goldstein lives in [[Boston]] and [[Truro, Massachusetts]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

She married her first husband, physicist Sheldon Goldstein, in 1969,&lt;ref name="lukeford.net"&gt;Luke Ford, [http://www.lukeford.net/profiles/profiles/rebecca_goldstein.htm "Interview with Novelist Rebecca Goldstein - The Mind-Body Problem"], conducted by phone April 11, 2006, transcript posted at lukeford.net&lt;/ref&gt; and they divorced in 1999.&lt;ref name="lukeford.net"/&gt; They are the parents of the novelist [[Yael Goldstein Love]] and poet Danielle Blau. In a 2006 interview with Luke Ford, Goldstein said:

{{Quote|text=I lived Orthodox for a long time. My husband was Orthodox. Because I didn't want to be hypocritical with our kids, I kept everything. I was torn like a character in a Russian novel. It lasted through college. I remember leaving a class on mysticism in tears because I had forsaken God. That was probably my last burst of religious passion. Then it went away and I was a happy little atheist.&lt;ref name=lukeford.net /&gt;}}

In 2007 she married&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/profile/story/0,,2285952,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Crace | title=Interview: Harvard University's Steven Pinker | date=June 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive psychologist [[Steven Pinker]].&lt;ref&gt;Greg Epstein, photograph taken December 2, 2007, [https://www.flickr.com/photos/goodwithoutgod/3926357965/ "Greg Epstein, Rebecca Goldstein &amp; Steve Pinker after Greg officiated at their wedding"], flickr.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Season of the Witch: Enchantment, Terror, and Deliverance in the City of Love''' is a history book by best-selling author [[David Talbot]]. The book captures the dark history of San Francisco from the 1960s to the early 1980s utilizing a “kaleidoscopic narrative” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citylights.com/book/?GCOI=87286100682710|title=Season of the Witch|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=City Lights|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tells the story of how "the 1967 [[Summer of Love]] gave way to 20 or so winters of discontent." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/season-of-the-witch-enchantment-terror-and-deliverance-in-the-city-of-love-by-david-talbot/2012/06/01/gJQAwWgt7U_story.html|title="Season of the Witch: Enchantment, Terror, and Deliverance in the City of Love," by David Talbot|last=Drabelle|first=Dennis|date=2012-06-01|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contexts==
"Season of the Witch" is broken down into three sections, each one depicting a different period within the city; each section is home to a number of chapters that are cleverly titled and a hodge-podge of clever puns to the utmost bizarre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Season-of-the-Witch-by-David-Talbot-review-3536031.php|title='Season of the Witch,' by David Talbot: review|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enchantment===
The story starts off with what San Francisco is best known for within its history:  [[Hippie|hippie kids]] and their [[drug]]s that lead to the birthplace of many [[social movement]]s and the rise of the [[1960s counterculture|Counter Culture]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/books/review/season-of-the-witch-by-david-talbot.html|title=‘Season of the Witch,’ by David Talbot|last=Ullman|first=Ellen|date=2012-08-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terror===
This is part of [[San Francisco]]  history that many would like to forget. [[Hells Angels]] running amok at the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] concert at [[Altamont Free Concert|Altamont,]] but saving one of the few free clinics.  The [[Zodiac Killer|Zodiac]] and [[Zebra murders|Zebra]] killers. And the hate-fueled political killing of [[George Moscone]] and [[Harvey Milk]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Deliverance===
The book concludes with [[White Night riots|the riots]] that followed and the AIDS epidemic that was just heating up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Appendix: The Best Songs Recorded by San Francisco Bands, 1965-1985===

Since San Francisco is known for its music and  music played a large part in its history, Talbot concludes the book with what he considers to be the best and most influential songs recorded during 1965-1985. Songs by [[San Francisco]] natives like [[Grateful Dead|The Grateful Dead]] and [[Jefferson Airplane]] are included in this list.

==One City One Book==
The [[San Francisco Public Library]] selected "Season of the Witch" as their [[One City One Book]] 2015 selection. An annual literacy event that, through a series of readings and discussions, aims to get the entire city reading and talking about one book with the overall goal of "building bridges between communities and generations" and making "reading a lifelong pursuit" in order to create a more literate society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sfpl.org/?pg=2000255701|title=About One City One Book|website=SFPL|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published==
"Season of the Witch" was published by Free Press (NYC) on May 8, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12352452-season-of-the-witch|title=Season of the Witch|website=Goodreads|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
"Season of the Witch" received starred reviews in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' and ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'', and was hailed as "enthralling, news-driven history" (''San Francisco Chronicle''), "energetic, highly entertaining storytelling" (''Boston Globe''), and "an enthralling – and harrowing – account of how the 1967 Summer of Love gave way to 20 or so winters of discontent" (''Washington Post'').

'''September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows''', also known as '''9/11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows''' or simply '''Peaceful Tomorrows''', is an [[anti-war]] organization for [[Casualties of the September 11 attacks#Survivors|survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks]] and friends and family members of the victims.

It aims to develop and advocate [[nonviolent]] options and actions in the pursuit of justice, in the hope that this will help break what the members see as the cycles of violence engendered by [[war]] and [[terrorism]].

Peaceful Tomorrows was launched on February 14, 2002, at a press conference at the [[United Nations headquarters]] by Colleen Kelly&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite news|last=Powell|first=Michael|journal=The Washington Post|date=September 8, 2006|title=The Disbelievers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/07/AR2006090701669_pf.html|quote=The loose agglomeration known as the ‘9/11 Truth Movement’|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other members of families that had lost members in the 9/11 attacks who did not want their grief to justify attacks such as the [[United States|American]] bombing campaign in [[Afghanistan]], and to ensure that these actions would not be done in their names and the names of their loved ones.

==The International Network for Peace==

The International Network for Peace is a project that grew out of Peaceful Tomorrows’ groundbreaking international conference [https://web.archive.org/web/20090830020954/http://www.peacefultomorrows.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=41 "Civilian Casualties, Civilian Solutions"] which took place on September 11, 2006, the five-year anniversary of 9/11.

In the weeks following, September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows brought conference participants to speak at several public events at American universities.

Chervonnaia and Svetlana Mikhailovna Chervonnaia &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Conflict in Abkhazia: Dilemmas in Russian 'Peacekeeping' Policy By Dov Lynch, p 153&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

'''Vladislav Ardzinba''' ({{lang-ab|Владислав Арӡынба}}, {{lang-ka|ვლადისლავ არძინბა}}; 14 May 1945 – 4 March 2010) was the first ''[[de facto]]'' [[President of Abkhazia|President]] of [[Abkhazia]]. A historian by education, Ardzinba led Abkhazia to ''[[de facto]]'' independence in the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|1992–1993 War with Georgia]], but its ''[[de jure]]'' independence from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] remained internationally unrecognised during Ardzinba's two terms as President from 1994 to 2005.

A noted specialist in [[Hittitology]], he was a member of the [[Congress of Soviets|first parliament]] to be elected democratically in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="First Abkhaz Leader Ardzinba Dead at 64"/&gt;

==Early life and career==
Vladislav Ardzinba was born in the village of Lower [[Eshera]], [[Sukhumi District]], [[Abkhaz ASSR]], [[Georgian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. After graduating from the Historical Department of the [[Sukhumi]] Pedagogical Institute, Ardzinba studied at the [[Tbilisi State University]] where he received a doctoral degree{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. He then worked for eighteen years in [[Moscow]] specialising in ancient [[Middle East]]ern civilizations under [[Yevgeniy Primakov]], then head of the Institute of [[Oriental Studies]] in Moscow, and later Russian foreign and Prime Minister{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. He then returned to Sukhumi and he served there as the director of the Abkhazian Institute of Language, Literature and History from 1987 until 1989, when he was elected a Deputy to the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] from [[Gudauta]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. From there, he was involved closely with national issues, including Abkhazia, and quickly emerged as one of the most active proponents of the Abkhaz secessionist cause. While a deputy to the USSR Supreme Soviet, Ardzinba forged close ties with the hardliners in Moscow, particularly with the parliamentary chairman [[Anatoly Lukyanov]] and other members of the hardline communist groups in Moscow that were responsible for the August 1991 coup attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, Svante E, Autonomy and Conflict: Ethnoterritoriality and Separatism in the South Caucasus – Case in Georgia, pp. 168, 180, 182. ''Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Report No. 61''. Uppsala. {{ISBN|91-506-1600-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict==
He was a member of the [[Congress of Soviets|first parliament]] to be elected democratically in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="First Abkhaz Leader Ardzinba Dead at 64"/&gt;

On 4 December 1990, Ardzinba was elected Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia.&lt;ref name="First Abkhaz Leader Ardzinba Dead at 64"/&gt; Ardzinba, a charismatic but excitable figure popular among the Abkhaz was believed by Georgians to have helped to instigate the [[1989 Sukhumi riots|violence of July 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart J. Kaufman (2001), ''Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War'', p. 117. Cornell University Press, {{ISBN|0-8014-8736-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ardzinba managed to consolidate his power relatively quickly and reneged on pre-election promises to increase the representation of Georgians in Abkhazia's autonomous structures; since then, Ardzinba tried to rule Abkhazia relatively single-handedly, but avoided, for the time being, overt conflict with the central authorities in [[Tbilisi]]. In mid-1991, he negotiated and accepted the Georgian concession on the reform of the electoral law that granted the Abkhaz wide over-representation in the Supreme Soviet. However, Ardzinba created the Abkhazian National Guard that was mono-ethnically Abkhaz, and initiated a practice of replacing ethnic Georgians in leading positions with Abkhaz. As the Georgian-Abkhaz tensions rose, Ardzinba's rhetoric mounted, as he claimed in late July 1992 that "Abkhazia is strong enough to fight Georgia."&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1992, a Georgian military force ousted Ardzinba and his group from Sukhumi. They took shelter in [[Gudauta]], a home to the Soviet-era Russian military base. Ardzinba benefited from his contacts with the Russian hardliner circles and military leaders to garner critical support in [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)|the war]] against the Georgian government.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency==

After the hostilities ended in 1994 and the bulk of the Georgian population was forced out of Abkhazia, the Abkhazian parliament [[Abkhazian presidential election, 1994|elected Ardzinba]] to the presidency, a move that was condemned by Georgia and the [[United Nations]] as illegal{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. He won the first direct polls on 3 October 1999, without an opponent and was re-elected as president of Abkhazia.&lt;ref&gt;The [[International Crisis Group]]. ''Abkhazia Today. Europe Report N°176'', pp. 5, 12. 15 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He installed an autocratic regime&lt;ref&gt;Tunç Aybak (2001), ''Politics of the Black Sea: Dynamics of Cooperation and Conflict'', p. 193. I.B. Tauris, {{ISBN|1-86064-454-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and remained politically untouchable until his health seriously deteriorated in 2003. He once stated that independence from Georgia is not negotiable, and he has tried to align the state with Russia, whose political and economic support was essential to the republic. As a leader of the Abkhaz side he met the two successive [[President of Russia|Russian presidents]], [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Vladimir Putin]], as well as a [[President of Georgia]], [[Eduard Shevardnadze]].

Under his rule, human rights records were extremely poor as most of the pre-war Georgian population of Abkhazia were deprived the right to return, and those who remained were subjected to systematic [[ethnic cleansing]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. Ardzinba aroused some further criticism from the international community after issuing a decree banning [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] in 1995{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.

During the last years of his presidency Ardzinba faced criticism for both failing to bring stability to Abkhazia and his increasingly low public profile. He had not appeared in public since 2002. As a result, the role of governing the state had been increasingly left to Prime Minister [[Raul Khajimba]].

He had been in extremely poor health and underwent treatment in [[Moscow]] for some time. Despite increasing calls from the opposition (particularly the [[Amtsakhara]] movement) for him to resign he had stated that he would finish his term, which was supposed to end in October 2004, but in fact did not end until 12 February 2005, due to disputes over the election of his successor. There were also calls for him to be impeached.  However, although the [[Constitution of Abkhazia|Abkhaz Constitution]] allows for impeachment, the process would likely have not been completed before the end of his term, so no serious steps were taken to bring it about. He was unable to run for a third term due to constitutional restrictions, and it is unlikely that his health would have enabled him to do so even if this was allowed.

He was replaced by the winner of the presidential election of 12 January 2005, [[Sergei Bagapsh]]. A previous election had been held in late 2004 after the murder of opposition leader [[Garri Aiba]], but the result was controversial.

==Biography==
Walter Laqueur was born in [[Breslau]], [[Lower Silesia Province (Prussia)|Lower Silesia]], [[Germany]] (today [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]), into a [[Jewish]] family. In 1938, he left Germany, [[aliyah|immigrating]] to  the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. His parents, who were unable to leave, were murdered in the [[Holocaust]]. After a year of study at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], Laqueur joined a [[kibbutz]] and worked as an agricultural laborer from 1939 to 1944.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.laqueur.net/index2.php?r=1 Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918152829/http://laqueur.net/index2.php?r=1 |date=18 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1939 and 1944, he lived at Kibbutz [[Sha'ar HaGolan]], Kibbutz [[Ein Shemer]], and, as a member, Kibbutz [[Shamir, Israel|Shamir]]. In 1955, Laqueur moved to London.

Laqueur died at his home in Washington, DC, on 30 September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Langer |first=Emily |date=30 September 2018 |title=Walter Laqueur, eminent scholar who probed the 20th century, dies at 97 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/walter-laqueur-eminent-scholar-who-probed-the-20th-century-dies-at-97/2018/09/30/a6d2acd0-c518-11e8-9b1c-a90f1daae309_story.html?utm_term=.e16ddd986d04 |work=[[Washington Post]] |location=Washington, DC |access-date=30 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism and academic career==
In Mandatory Palestine, he worked  as a correspondent for the [[Hashomer Hatzair]] newspaper, ''Mishmar'' (later, [[Al HaMishmar]]), and for ''The Palestine Post'' (later, [[The Jerusalem Post]]), before moving to the United States. In 1944, he moved to [[Jerusalem]], where he worked as a journalist until 1953 as a [[Middle East]] correspondent.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

He was founder and editor, with [[George Mosse]], of the ''[[Journal of Contemporary History]]'' and of ''Survey'' from 1956 to 1964. He was also founding editor of ''The Washington Papers''. He was Director of the [[Wiener Library|Institute of Contemporary History]] and the [[Wiener Library]] in [[London]] from 1965 to 1994,&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5madOAUfKZUC&amp;pg=PA380#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=''Russia and Germany'': About author|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1969 he was a member, and later Chairman (until 2000), of the International Research Council of the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], Washington.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; He was Professor of the History of Ideas at [[Brandeis University]] from 1968 to 1972, and University Professor at [[Georgetown University]] from 1976 to 1988. He was also a visiting professor of history and government at [[Harvard]], the [[University of Chicago]], [[Tel Aviv University]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]].

Laqueur's main works deal with [[History of Europe|European history]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, especially [[History of Russia|Russian history]] and [[History of Germany|German history]], as well as the history of the Middle East. The topics he wrote about include the [[German Youth Movement]], [[Zionism]], [[History of Israel|Israeli history]], the [[cultural history]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] and [[Russia]], [[Communism]], [[the Holocaust]], [[fascism]], and the [[diplomatic history]] of the [[Cold War]]. His books have been translated into many languages. His comments on international affairs appeared in many American and European newspapers and periodicals.

Archer was born in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], the eldest boy of the nine children of [[Thomas Archer (pastoralist)|Thomas Archer]] and his wife Grace, ''née'' Morrison. Thomas moved frequently from place to place seeking employment, and William attended schools in Perth, [[Lymington]], [[Reigate]] and Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Wearing J., P. [https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/30435 "Archer, William (1856–1924), theatre critic and journalist"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', 2004, retrieved 28 December 2017 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent parts of his boyhood with relatives in Norway where he became fluent in Norwegian and became acquainted with the works of [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;ref name=md&gt;Drabble, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

Archer won a [[bursary]] to [[Edinburgh University]], to study English literature, moral and natural philosophy, and mathematics. When the family moved to Australia in 1872 he remained in Scotland as a student. While still at the university he became a leader-writer on the ''Edinburgh Evening News'' in 1875, and after a year visiting his family in Australia, he returned to Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1878, in accordance with his father's wishes, he moved to London to train as a [[barrister]]. He was uninterested in the law, and was by now fascinated with the theatre, but he qualified for the bar in 1883, although he never practised.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He supported himself by working as dramatic critic of ''[[London Figaro|The London Figaro]]'', and after he finished his legal studies he moved to ''[[The World (journal)|The World]]'', where he remained from 1884 to 1906.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In London he soon took a prominent literary place and exercised much influence.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Archer played an important part in introducing Ibsen to the English public, starting with his translation of ''[[The Pillars of Society]]'', produced at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in 1880. It was the first Ibsen play to be produced in London but made little impression.&lt;ref name=md/&gt; He also translated, alone or in collaboration, other productions of the Scandinavian stage: Ibsen's ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1889), ''[[The Master Builder]]'' (1893, with [[Edmund Gosse]]); [[Edvard Brandes]]'s ''A Visit'' (1892); Ibsen's ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' (1892, with [[Charles Archer]]); ''[[Little Eyolf]]'' (1895); and ''[[John Gabriel Borkman]]'' (1897); and he edited Ibsen's ''Prose Dramas'', 1890–1891).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1881 Archer met Frances Elizabeth Trickett (1855–1929), the youngest of the eight children of John Trickett, a retired engineer. They married in October 1884; the following year they had their only child, Tom (1885–1918), who was killed in action in the [[First World War]]. The marriage was enduring and companionable, although in 1891 Archer began a relationship which lasted for the rest of his life with the actress [[Elizabeth Robins]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1897 Archer, along with Robins, [[Henry William Massingham]], and [[Alfred Sutro]], formed the Provisional Committee to organise an association to produce plays they considered to be of high literary merit, such as Ibsen's. The association was called the "New Century Theatre" but was a disappointment by 1899, although it continued until at least 1904.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1899, a more successful association, called the [[Stage Society]], was formed to replace it.&lt;ref&gt;Woodfield, pp 56–58&lt;/ref&gt;

Archer was a friend of [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], and arranged for his plays to be translated into German. An attempted collaboration on a play foundered, although Shaw later turned their joint ideas into his early work, ''[[Widower's Houses]]''. Through Archer's influence Shaw obtained the post of art critic to ''The World'', before becoming its music critic.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; A biographer, J. P. Wearing, says of their relationship:
{{quote|Their intimate friendship could also be very turbulent, since both men were forthright and honest. Shaw respected Archer's intelligence and integrity, and penetrated his formality and deliberately cultivated dour Scots façade. Archer thought Shaw brilliant if perverse, and concluded that he never achieved his great potential because he was too much a jester.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|}}

During the First World War, Archer worked for the official War Propaganda Bureau. After the war, he achieved financial success with his play ''[[The Green Goddess (play)|The Green Goddess]]'', produced by [[Winthrop Ames]] at the [[Booth Theatre]] in New York in 1921.  It was a melodrama, and a popular success, although, he admitted, of much less importance to the art of the drama than his critical work.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Archer died in a London nursing home in 1924 of post-operative complications after the removal of a kidney tumour. Reviewing his life and career, Wearing's summary is that Archer was "a clear, logical man whom some saw as too narrowly rationalistic", but who was perceptive, intuitive and imaginative. Wearing attributes Archer's great influence as a critic to these qualities and to the length of time for which he was engaged in the theatre and reviewing, although
{{quote|[he] had his blind spots, as in his failure to understand Chekhov, Strindberg, and Shaw, but he was incorruptibly honest and unwaveringly committed to the improvement of … the theatre. His pioneering advocacy of Ibsen in England cannot be underestimated … although his other contributions to the theatre are equally valuable.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|}}
