''Amelia Rules!'' follows the life of Amelia Louise McBride as she adjusts to life in a new town after her parents' divorce causes her to leave life in [[Manhattan]]. She is helped along the way by an odd group of friends and her ever-cool aunt, Tanner Clark.

The book has been nominated for 13 [[Eisner Awards]] as well as five [[Harvey Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;(August 13, 2014), "[http://cbldf.org/2014/08/using-graphic-novels-in-education-amelia-rules/ Using Graphic Novels in Education: Amelia Rules!]," [[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]]. Retrieved November 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a short list finalist for the [[Howard E. Day Prize]] in 2002. In 2007, ''Amelia Rules!

==Cast==

'''Amelia McBride'''

Amelia Louise McBride is a 5th-grade spitfire, a whip-smart, wisecracking tomboy who can be surprisingly sweet and giving. Forced out of New York City following her parents’ divorce, Amelia takes setbacks in stride—for the most part.

'''Reggie Grabinsky'''

Leader and founder of G.A.S.P. (Gathering of Awesome Super Pals), Reggie Grabinsky is a fun-loving, silly guy with a loose grasp on reality. However he can be something that might be considered mature when he needs to.

'''Rhonda Bleenie'''

Rhonda Bleenie is a smart, stubborn, and loud girl. She is friends with Amelia because of geography and nothing else. She was well known for her hairstyle until she adapted a more down-to-earth look, as well as her unabashed love for Reggie.

'''Pajamaman'''

Being the most popular kid in class, being dirt poor, never speaking, and never changing out of his “footie” pajamas requires the magic of this man...Pajamaman. How does he do it? Pajamaman is a loyal friend, a great listener, and cute as a button.
Though 'PM' is the shy, silent type, one can always know what he's thinking by checking out the symbol on his jammies.

'''Tanner Clark'''

Amelia’s Aunt Tanner is a friend, a confidant, and a mentor. She’s Amelia’s Jiminy Cricket. That is, if Jiminy was a Rock ‘N Roll hipster hottie, instead of, y’know, a bug. She always tells the truth, even when it’s difficult. At one time Tanner was a pop rock princess who ruled the charts, but she retired for mysterious reasons and now lives the quiet life in small town PA. But there is always the chance of a big-time comeback tour.

'''Amelia’s mom and dad'''

Typical average parents who are going through a divorce. Amelia’s mom is a bit too overwhelmed to completely connect with her daughter at times but her love for Amelia is evident. She uses care and caution when approaching potentially unsettling moments, like telling Amelia that they are moving (again) and breaking the news that she is going out on a date.

Amelia’s dad also loves his daughter unconditionally, but struggles to be an active part of her life, given his infrequent visits and the miles that separate them. A bit depressed from the collapse of his marriage and the dwindling popularity of the company he promotes (he’s marketing director for Softee Chicken, a once-popular kids’ franchise), he still maintains a semi-cordial relationship with his ex (that is when he doesn't think Amelia is around).

'''Ninja Kyle'''

Leader of G.A.S.P.’s arch-rivals, the Park View Terrace Ninjas, Kyle comes off as an arrogant jerk, taking great delight in embarrassing (even humiliating) other kids. But Kyle’s jerk-like tendencies may be rooted in something deeper - a genuine affection for Amelia, who reluctantly gets past Kyle’s tough exterior, and even agrees to be his “date” to their first school dance. It is difficult to understand how Amelia could ignore Kyle's awful behavior, and it can only be guessed that Kyle's occasional moments of humanity make it difficult for her to remember the worse things he's done. He was injured in a fall at the climax of "True Things" and reappears in "Her Permanent Record"  in which he has not completely recovered from his injuries after he broke his leg. He also started to reconnect with Amelia and become friends again after the accident.

'''Trishia'''

A friend of both Amelia and Ninja Kyle, Trishia is the writer for all articles in the ''Tweennie Zeenie'' (a neighborhood magazine). She writes them all under different pen names except for a story called ''The Adventures of Princess Trishara''. She suffers from a severe case of ventricular septal defect which eventually causes her to move to California to see a specialist in "Superheroes", but she sends Amelia a letter years later to tell her that she survived the operation.

'''Sunday Jones'''

Amelia’s best friend from her New York days, Sunday is Amelia’s equal in terms of spunk and wit.

'''Ninja Joan Driscoll'''

Originally known to Amelia only as a member of the rival Park View Terrace Ninjas, Joan became closer friends with Amelia and Rhonda after her father, a Captain in the US Army, was deployed overseas for a year. Joan’s tomboy tendencies and a quick wit make her a natural fit in Amelia’s small group of friends.

'''Owen'''

A minor friend of Amelia. He is mentioned to always smell like cheese. He is also a member of G.A.S.P., although, he doesn't seem to have an alter ego and simply wears homemade bat wings that he believes enables him to fly, which is proven wrong when he attempted to ambush the Park View Terrace Ninjas and fell.

'''Mary Violet/Ultra Violet'''

A girl who appears to be Catholic and described as a "Cabbage Patch Kid that threw up". In the second volume, she develops a violent personality after a fight with Reggie and joins G.A.S.P. under the alias Ultra Violet.

'''Earth Dog'''

Reggie's cousin who enjoys writing poems and is a member of G.A.S.P. as Bear Hugger.

'''Bug And Iggy'''

Bullies that torment Reggie. This is temporarily halted after Reggie sneeze-barfed on them. Later, they continue to bully and annoy Reggie by existing.

'''G.A.S.P.'''

G.A.S.P. is a superhero group that protects the neighborhood from whatever happens to be bugging leader and founder Reggie Grabinsky, such as Ninjas and the Legion of Evil Steves. Founding members are Reggie (Captain Amazing), Amelia (Princess Powerful), Rhonda (Ms. Miraculous), and Pajama Man (Kid Lightning). New members are Mary Violet (Ultra Violet), Owen (no alter ego), and Earth Dog (Bear Hugger).

'''Britney, Christina and Jessica'''

The so-called popular kids of the school. Every boy's dream and girls nightmare, the mean group is constantly teasing everyone in school. The posse is led by Britney, whose biting wit can put a comedian to shame. As part of the cheerleaders, these evil triplets are someone to look out for.

{{short description|English rock band fronted by Damon Albarn and one of the pioneering groups of the 1990s britpop scene}}

'''Blur''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in London in 1988. The group consists of singer/keyboardist [[Damon Albarn]], guitarist/singer [[Graham Coxon]], bassist [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]] and drummer [[Dave Rowntree]]. Their debut album ''[[Leisure (album)|Leisure]]'' (1991) incorporated the sounds of [[Madchester]] and [[shoegazing]]. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as [[the Kinks]], [[the Beatles]] and [[XTC]], Blur released ''[[Modern Life Is Rubbish]]'' (1993), ''[[Parklife]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Great Escape (Blur album)|The Great Escape]]'' (1995). In the process, the band became central to the [[Britpop]] music and culture movement, and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a chart battle with rivals [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] in 1995 dubbed the "Battle of Britpop".

In recording their follow-up, ''[[Blur (Blur album)|Blur]]'' (1997), the band underwent another reinvention, showing influence from the [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] style of American [[indie rock]] groups. The band's third UK number one album, ''Blur'' included the "[[Song 2]]" single, which brought them mainstream success in the US. Their next album, ''[[13 (Blur album)|13]]'' (1999) saw the band members experimenting with [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[gospel music]], and featured more personal lyrics from Albarn. In May 2002, Coxon left Blur during the recording of their seventh album ''[[Think Tank (Blur album)|Think Tank]]'' (2003). Containing electronic sounds and more minimal guitar work, the album was marked by Albarn's growing interest in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[African music]]. After a 2003 tour without Coxon, Blur did no studio work or touring as a band, as members engaged in other projects.

Blur reunited, with Coxon back in the fold, for a series of concerts in 2009. In the following years they released several singles and retrospective compilations, and toured internationally. In 2012, the group received a [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for [[2012 Brit Awards|Outstanding Contribution to Music]]. Their first major release in twelve years, ''[[The Magic Whip]]'' (2015), became the sixth consecutive Blur studio album to top the British charts.

==History==

===Formation and ''Leisure'', 1988–91===
[[File:Blur (Logo).png|thumb|After their original name ''Seymour'' was rejected by Food, the band chose ''Blur'' from a list of alternatives the label drew up.]]

Childhood friends Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon from [[Essex]] met Alex James when they began studying at London's [[Goldsmiths College]] in 1988. Albarn was in a group named Circus, who were joined by drummer Dave Rowntree that October.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson209"&gt;Thompson, 2004, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Circus requested the services of Coxon after the departure of their guitarist. That December, Circus fired two members and James joined as the group's bassist. This new group named themselves Seymour in December 1988, inspired by [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[Seymour: An Introduction]]''.&lt;ref name="Thompson209" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The group performed live for the first time in summer 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In November, [[Food Records]]' [[A&amp;R]] representative Andy Ross attended a Seymour performance that convinced him to court the group for his label. The only concern held by Ross and Food was that they disliked the band's name. Food drew up a list of alternatives, from which the group decided on "Blur". Food Records finally signed the newly christened band in March 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

From March to July 1990, Blur toured Britain, opening for [[the Cramps]], and testing out new songs. In October 1990, after their tour was over, Blur released the "[[She's So High (Blur song)|She's So High]]" single, which reached number 48 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Strong, 2003, pp. 635–636&lt;/ref&gt; The band had trouble creating a follow-up single, but they made progress when paired with producer [[Stephen Street]]. The resulting single release, "[[There's No Other Way]]", became a hit, peaking at number eight.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the single's success, Blur became pop stars and were accepted into a clique of bands who frequented the Syndrome club in London dubbed "[[The Scene That Celebrates Itself]]".&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[NME]]'' magazine wrote in 1991, "[Blur] are [the] acceptable pretty face of a whole clump of bands that have emerged since the whole Manchester thing started to run out of steam."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Danny. "Sacre Blur!" ''NME''. 20 July 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The band's third single, "[[Bang (Blur song)|Bang]]", performed relatively disappointingly, reaching only number 24.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Ross and Food owner [[David Balfe]] were convinced Blur's best course of action was to continue drawing influence from the [[Madchester]] genre. Blur attempted to expand their musical sound, but the recording of the group's debut album was hindered by Albarn having to write his lyrics in the studio. Although the resulting album ''[[Leisure (album)|Leisure]]'' (1991) peaked at number seven on the [[UK Albums Chart]], it received mixed reviews,&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt; and according to journalist [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]], "could not shake off the odour of anti-climax".&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

After discovering they were £60,000 in debt, Blur toured the United States in 1992 in an attempt to recoup their financial losses.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The group released the single "[[Popscene]]" to coincide with the start of the tour. Featuring "a rush of punk guitars, '60s pop hooks, blaring British horns, controlled fury, and postmodern humor",&lt;ref&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. "[{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t993355|pure_url=yes}} 'Popscene' song review]". [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on 16 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; "Popscene" was a turning point for the band musically.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, pp. 67, 77&lt;/ref&gt; However, upon its release it only charted at number 32. "We felt 'Popscene' was a big departure; a very, very English record", Albarn told the ''NME'' in 1993, "But that annoyed a lot of people ... We put ourselves out on a limb to pursue this English ideal and no-one was interested."&lt;ref name="shite"&gt;Harris, John. "A shite sports car and a punk reincarnation". ''NME''. 10 April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the single's lacklustre performance, plans to release a single named "Never Clever" were scrapped and work on Blur's second album was pushed back.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

During the two-month American tour, the band became increasingly unhappy, often venting frustrations on each other, leading to several physical confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The band members were homesick; Albarn said, "I just started to miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England so I started writing songs which created an English atmosphere."&lt;ref name="shite" /&gt; Upon the group's return to Britain, Blur (Albarn in particular) were upset by the success rival group [[Suede (band)|Suede]] had achieved while they were gone.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt; After a poor performance at a 1992 gig that featured a well-received set by Suede on the same bill, Blur were in danger of being dropped by Food.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American [[grunge]] bands like [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Although sceptical of Albarn's new manifesto for Blur, Balfe gave assent for the band's choice of [[Andy Partridge]] (of [[XTC]]) to produce their follow-up to ''Leisure''. The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Blur completed their second album ''[[Modern Life Is Rubbish]]'' in December 1992, but Food Records said the album required more potential hit singles and asked them to return to the studio for a second time. The band complied and Albarn wrote "[[For Tomorrow]]", which became the album's lead single.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; "For Tomorrow" was a minor success, reaching number 28 on the charts.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; ''Modern Life Is Rubbish'' was released in May 1993. The announcement of the album's release included a press photo which featured Blur, dressed in a mix of [[Mod (subculture)#Fashion|mod]] and [[skinhead]] attire, posing alongside a [[English Mastiff|mastiff]] with the words "British Image 1" spraypainted behind them. At the time, such imagery was viewed as nationalistic and racially insensitive by the British music press; to quieten concerns, Blur released the "British Image 2" photo, which was "a camp restaging of a pre-war aristocratic tea party".&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; ''Modern Life Is Rubbish'' peaked at number 15 on the British charts,&lt;ref name="UKChart"&gt;"[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/blur/ Blur Single &amp; Album Chart History]". [[Official Charts Company]]. Retrieved on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to break into the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling only 19,000 copies there.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Tom.

Retrieved on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''[[Parklife]]'' (1994) revived Blur's commercial fortunes. The album's first single, the disco-influenced "[[Girls &amp; Boys (Blur song)|Girls &amp; Boys]]", found favour on [[BBC Radio 1]] and peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; and number 59 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] where it remains the band's highest-charting single.&lt;ref name=allmusicawards /&gt; ''Parklife'' entered the British charts at number one and stayed on the album charts for 90 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Enthusiastically greeted by the music press—the ''NME'' called it "a Great Pop Record ... bigger, bolder, narkier and funnier [than ''Modern Life is Rubbish'']"—''Parklife'' is regarded as one of Britpop's defining records.&lt;ref&gt;Dee, John. "Blur – ''Parklife''". ''NME''. April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. "[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r202255|pure_url=yes}} ''Parklife'' review]". [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on 16 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Blur won four awards at the [[1995 Brit Awards]], including Best Band and Best Album for ''Parklife''.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Coxon later pointed to ''Parklife'' as the moment when "[Blur] went from being regarded as an alternative, left field arty band to this amazing new pop sensation".&lt;ref name="totalguitar"&gt;Tuxen, Henrik; Dalley, Helen. "Graham Coxon interview". ''[[Total Guitar]]''. May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blur began working on their fourth album ''[[The Great Escape (Blur album)|The Great Escape]]'' at the start of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Building upon the band's previous two albums, Albarn's lyrics for the album consisted of several third-person narratives. James reflected, "It was all more elaborate, more orchestral, more theatrical, and the lyrics were even more twisted ... It was all dysfunctional, misfit characters fucking up."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, pp. 223–24&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the album's lead single "[[Country House]]" played a part in Blur's public rivalry with Manchester band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] termed the "Battle of Britpop". Partly due to increasing antagonisms between the groups, Blur and Oasis ultimately decided to release their new singles on the same day, an event the ''NME'' called "The British Heavyweight Championship". The debate over which band would top the British singles chart became a media phenomenon, and Albarn appeared on the ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]''.&lt;ref name=liveforever&gt;''Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop''. Passion Pictures, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the week, "Country House" ultimately outsold Oasis' "[[Roll with It (Oasis song)|Roll With It]]" by 274,000 copies to 216,000, becoming Blur's first number one single.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Great Escape'', which Albarn told the public was the last instalment in the band's Life Trilogy, was released in September 1995 to ecstatic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt; The ''NME'' hailed it as "spectacularly accomplished, sumptuous, heart-stopping and inspirational",&lt;ref&gt;Cigarettes, Johnny.

Following the worldwide success of Oasis' ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (which went quadruple platinum in America), the media quipped "[Blur] wound up winning the battle but losing the war."&lt;ref&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. "[{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t1315546|pure_url=yes}} 'Country House' song review]". [[Allmusic]].

"The Death of a Party". ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]''. August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reinvention after Britpop, 1996–2000===
An early 1996 ''Q'' magazine interview revealed that relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy wrote that he found them "on the verge of a nervous breakup".&lt;ref name="select" /&gt; Coxon, in particular, began to resent his band mates: James for his playboy lifestyle, and Albarn for his control over Blur's musical direction and public image.&lt;ref name="select" /&gt; The guitarist struggled with drinking problems and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2004, pp. 259–60&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1996, when Coxon and James were absent for a lip-synced Blur performance broadcast on Italian television, they were replaced by a cardboard cutout and a roadie, respectively. Blur biographer [[Stuart Maconie]] later wrote that, at the time, "Blur were sewn together very awkwardly".&lt;ref name="select" /&gt;

Although he had previously dismissed it, Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. "I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on", he said.&lt;ref name="select" /&gt; He subsequently approached Street, and argued for a more stripped-down sound on the band's next record. Coxon, recognising his own personal need to—as Rowntree put it—"work this band", wrote a letter to Albarn, describing his desire for their music "to scare people again". After initial sessions in London, the band left to record the rest of the album in Iceland, away from the Britpop scene.&lt;ref name="select" /&gt;

The result was ''[[Blur (Blur album)|Blur]]'', the band's fifth studio album, released in February 1997. Although the music press predicted that the lo-fi sonic experimentation would alienate Blur's teenage girl fan-base, they generally applauded the effort. Pointing out lyrics such as "Look inside America/She's alright", and noting Albarn's "obligatory nod to [[Beck]], [and promotion of] the new Pavement album as if paid to do so", reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this time—an about-face of their attitude during the Britpop years.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Andrew. "Blur: Keeping It Simple". ''Q''. March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite cries of "commercial suicide", the album and its first single, "[[Beetlebum]]", debuted at number one in the UK.&lt;ref name="melody"&gt;Sutherland, Mark. "Altered States". ''[[Melody Maker]]''. 21 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the album could not match the sales of its predecessors in Britain, internationally ''Blur'' was more successful.&lt;ref name="melody" /&gt; In the US, the album received strong reviews, reached number 61 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified gold.&lt;ref name=allmusicawards /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US certificates: searchable database |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=1 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archivedate=26 June 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's "Song 2" single was also popular on alternative radio, reaching number six on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock chart]].&lt;ref name=allmusicawards /&gt; After it was licensed for use in various media—such as soundtracks, advertisements and television shows—"Song 2" became the most recognisable Blur song in the US. After the success of ''Blur'', the band embarked on a nine-month world tour.&lt;ref name="select" /&gt;

In February 1998, a few months after completing the tour, Blur released ''[[Bustin' + Dronin']]'' for the Japanese market. The album is a collection of Blur songs [[remix]]ed by artists such as [[Thurston Moore]], [[William Orbit]] and [[Moby]]. Among the tracks, the band were most impressed by Orbit's effort and enlisted him to replace Street as producer for their next album,&lt;ref&gt;Sillitoe, Sue.

August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; citing a need to approach the recording process from a fresh perspective.&lt;ref name="totalguitar" /&gt;

Released in March 1999, Blur's sixth studio album ''[[13 (Blur album)|13]]'' saw them drift still further away from their Britpop-era attitude and sound. Orbit's production style allowed for more jamming, and incorporated a "variety of emotions, atmospheres, words and sounds" into the mix. ''13'' was creatively dominated by Coxon, who "was simply allowed to do whatever he chose, unedited", by Orbit.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;Sullivan, Caroline.

While ''Q'' called it "a dense, fascinating, idiosyncratic and accomplished [[art rock]] album",&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Tom. "Blur – ''13'' review". ''Q''.

''NME''. 10 March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''13'' debuted at the top of the UK charts, staying at that position for two weeks. The album's lead single, the gospel-based "[[Tender (song)|Tender]]", opened at the second spot on the charts. After "[[Coffee &amp; TV]]", the first Blur single to feature Coxon on lead vocals, only reached number 11 in the UK, manager Chris Morrison demanded a chart re-run because of what he deemed was a sales miscalculation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/393073.stm Blur boss demands chart re-run]".

In July 1999, in celebration of their tenth anniversary, Blur released a [[The 10 Year Limited Edition Anniversary Box Set|22-CD limited edition box-set]] of their singles.

February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2000, the group released the compilation ''[[Blur: The Best of]]'', which debuted at number three in the UK and received a Platinum certification for 300,000 copies shipped.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.billboard.com/#/news/u2-leaves-the-competition-behind-875990.story U2 Leaves The Competition 'Behind']".

"A Hard Day's Night". ''Mojo''. November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the group had largely disowned the upbeat pop singles from the Britpop era, and favoured the more arty, experimental work on ''Blur'' and ''13''. In an otherwise highly enthusiastic review of the best-of for the ''NME'', Steve Sutherland criticised the band's "sheer disregard" for their earlier work; "Just because these songs embarrassed them once they started listening to broadsheet critics and retreated wounded from the big-sales battle with Oasis doesn't mean that we're morons to love them."&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, Steve. "Blur – Blur: The Best Of review". ''NME''. October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coxon's departure, ''Think Tank'' and hiatus, 2001–07===
After ''13'' and the subsequent tours in 1999–2000, band members pursued other projects. Graham Coxon recorded a string of solo albums, while Damon Albarn dedicated his time to [[Gorillaz]], the animated band he had created with [[Jamie Hewlett]]. Alex James worked with [[Fat Les]] and co-wrote several songs with [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]] and [[Marianne Faithfull]].&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;Mulholland, Garry.

'''Cedar Fair, L.P.''', doing business as the '''Cedar Fair Entertainment Company''', is a publicly traded partnership headquartered at its [[Cedar Point]] amusement park in  [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]], [[Ohio]]. The company owns and operates twelve [[amusement park]]s, two outdoor [[water park]]s, one indoor water park, and five hotels in the US and Canada.&lt;ref name="Cedar-Fair-Mar-2013-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/20/0001193125-13-098954.pdf |title=Cedar Fair, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Mar 8, 2013 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cedar Fair also manages [[Gilroy Gardens]] under contract with the city of [[Gilroy, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cedarfair.com/ir/company/properties/ |title=Properties |work=Cedar Fair official site |accessdate=30 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818140427/http://www.cedarfair.com/ir/company/properties/ |archivedate=18 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Cedar Point]] opened in 1870 as a recreational area. The park was developed over the years going through only a few managements. The park belonged to the Cedar Point Pleasure Company. In 1974, Cedar Point Pleasure Company proposed building an amusement park in [[Cambridge Township, Michigan]] on the former Frontier City amusement park site. Those plans were abandoned in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lenconnect.com/news/x1602164858/Cedar-Point-sells-Cambridge-Township-property|title=Ceder Point sells Cambridge Township property|accessdate=30 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731000106/http://www.lenconnect.com/news/x1602164858/Cedar-Point-sells-Cambridge-Township-property|archivedate=31 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Cedar Point acquired [[Valleyfair]]. The name Cedar Fair then was derived from the names of both parks, "Cedar" coming from Cedar Point and "Fair" coming from Valleyfair.  Cedar Fair was founded in 1983 then went public on April 29, 1987.&lt;ref name="Cedar-Fair-Mar-1994-10-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1050/81153294000011/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Mar 23, 1994 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dick Kinzel era===
The first acquisition of the new Cedar Fair company came in 1992 when Cedar Fair bought [[Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom|Dorney Park]] from Harris Weinstein. Cedar Fair also bought [[Worlds of Fun]] from Hunt-Midwest in 1995.&lt;ref name="Cedar-Fair-Aug-1995-10-Q"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2395/81153295000023/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 10-Q, Quarterly Report, Filing Date Aug 9, 1995 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the biggest acquisitions came in 1997 when Cedar Fair bought [[Knott's Berry Farm]] from the Knott family.&lt;ref name="Cedar-Fair-Jan-1998-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/375/81153298000002/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jan 13, 1998 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merritt, Christopher, and Lynxwiler, J.

The acquisition included operations of the Camp Snoopy indoor park at the [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]]. In 2005, Cedar Fair withdrew from the lease arrangement leaving Mall of America to manage the park on its own. Mall of America formed a partnership with the Nickelodeon franchise in 2007, and continues to operate under the name [[Nickelodeon Universe]]. Several new water park properties named [[Knott's Soak City]] opened around the southern California area since the acquisition which included Buena Park in 1999, Chula Vista in 2000 and Palm Springs in 2001.&lt;ref name="Cedar-Fair-Mar-2001-10-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2199/81153201500004/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Mar 30, 2001 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cedar-Fair-Apr-2002-10-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/1364/0000811532-02-000002.pdf |title=Cedar Fair, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Apr 1, 2002 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michigan's Adventure]] in Muskegon, Michigan was purchased for $27.6 million in 2001.&lt;ref name="Cedar-Fair-Nov-2001-10-Q"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2210/81153201500015/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 10-Q, Quarterly Report, Filing Date Nov 14, 2001 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cedar Fair opened its first indoor water park in November 2004, [[Castaway Bay (Sandusky, Ohio)|Castaway Bay]]. It was added to the former Radisson Hotel which was then renamed. The indoor waterpark resort is open year-round.&lt;ref name="Cedar-Fair-Jul-2004-424B2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/1797/0000950152-04-005364.pdf |title=Cedar Fair, Form 424B2, Filing Date Jul 15, 2004 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger acquisitions followed in 2004 with [[Geauga Lake|Six Flags World of Adventure]]. Cedar Fair bought the park for $145 million from Six Flags Inc. and reverted its name back to Geauga Lake, the name the park used until its Six Flags branding in 2000.&lt;ref name="Cedar-Fair-Apr-2004-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1053/81153204000024/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Apr 23, 2004 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geauga lake"&gt;{{cite news|last=Potter|first=Derek|title=Cedar Fair Buys Six Flags World of Adventure|publisher=Theme Park Insider|date=2004-03-10|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/news/response.cfm?ID=1564|accessdate=2007-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the park started losing attendance and various rides, leading to rumors of the park closing. On September 21, 2007, it was announced that Geauga Lake would close and only the connected water park would operate as [[Wildwater Kingdom (Aurora, Ohio)|Geauga Lake's Wildwater Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Cedar-Fair-Sep-2007-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/1922/0001193125-07-207821.pdf |title=Cedar Fair, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Sep 26, 2007 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the rides at Geauga Lake were sent to other Cedar Fair parks to operate. In 2011, the water park's name was shortened to just [[Wildwater Kingdom (Aurora, Ohio)|Wildwater Kingdom]], removing the ''Geauga Lake'' prefix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/198311/3/Aurora-Wildwater-Kingdom-nixes-Geauga-Lake-name|title=Aurora Wildwater Kingdom nixes Geauga Lake name|publisher=wkyc news|accessdate=30 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120919161809/http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/198311/3/Aurora-Wildwater-Kingdom-nixes-Geauga-Lake-name|archivedate=19 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WildWater Kingdom closed in 2016.

On May 22, 2006, Cedar Fair announced it had outbid competitors and intended to purchase all five parks in the [[Paramount Parks]] chain, including [[Star Trek: The Experience]] at the Las Vegas Hilton and the management agreement of [[Gilroy Gardens|Bonfante Gardens]]. On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair announced that it had completed its acquisition of Paramount Parks from [[CBS Corporation]] in a cash transaction valued at $1.24 billion USD.&lt;ref name="Cedar-Fair-Jul-2006-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/757/81153206000061/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jul 7, 2006 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paramount"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cedar Fair to Acquire Paramount Parks |publisher=The Point Online |date=2006-05-22 |url=http://www.thepointol.com/news/2006/76.html |accessdate=2007-12-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814210552/http://www.thepointol.com/news/2006/76.html |archivedate=2007-08-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly following the transfer of ownership, Cedar Fair began the process of integrating the two companies. With the purchase of the Paramount Parks, Cedar Fair LP announced that it would do business under the name Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Cedar Fair LP remains the legal company name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cedar Fair to call self entertainment company|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Economy/2006/10/25/Cedar-Fair-to-call-self-entertainment-company.html|publisher=[[Toledo Blade]]|accessdate=October 9, 2012|date=October 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual parks continued to operate under their Paramount names during the 2006 season, however Cedar Fair began removing the Paramount name and logo from the parks in January 2007. The names of the parks were changed back to their original pre-Paramount names (the Paramount's prefix was removed) with the Cedar Fair corporate logo added. Bonfante Gardens was changed to Gilroy Gardens. Cedar Fair began removing references to [[Paramount Pictures]] Although the acquisition granted Cedar Fair a ten-year licensing deal for Paramount names and icons, such as Star Trek and Batman, Cedar Fair opted to terminate the agreement and not pay an annual licensing fee. All references to Paramount/CBS-licensed properties were removed before the beginning of the 2007 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Economy/2006/05/23/Cedar-Point-s-parent-firm-buys-5-additional-parks-for-1-24-billion.html|publisher=Toledo Blade|author=Jon Chavez|title=Cedar Point's parent firm buys 5 additional parks for $1.24 billion|date=May 23, 2006|accessdate=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cedar Fair planned to hold a shareholder meeting on March 16, 2010 to vote on the transaction but postponed the meeting to April 8, 2010, implying that two-thirds of the shareholder vote needed for approval wasn't yet secured.&lt;ref name="Apollo delay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocresort.ocregister.com/2010/03/16/sale-of-knotts-berry-farms-owner-postponed/37805/|title=UPDATE: Knott's grandson weighs in on sale delay|date=16 March 2010|publisher=The Orange Register|accessdate=19 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720091025/http://ocresort.ocregister.com/2010/03/16/sale-of-knotts-berry-farms-owner-postponed/37805/|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=}}

Distributed worldwide by [[Paramount Pictures]] on December 21, 2012, the film tells the story of a girl named Mia going to a traveling circus and falling in love with its main attraction, the Aerialist. After the Aerialist falls during his act, he and Mia are transported to another world where each encounter the different worlds of [[Cirque du Soleil]]. It stars Erica Linz and Igor Zaripov as the main characters and incorporates acts from [[O (Cirque du Soleil)|O]], [[Mystère (Cirque du Soleil)|Mystère]], [[Kà]], [[Love (Cirque du Soleil)|Love]], [[Zumanity]], [[Criss Angel Believe]], and [[Viva Elvis]], some of the Cirque du Soleil shows that were running in [[Las Vegas]] in 2011.

==Plot==
Mia, a young woman in a small American Midwestern town, goes to a traveling carnival one evening, where she is urged by a silent clown to visit the carnival's circus and see the Aerialist, the show's star attraction. She is entranced by the Aerialist, but during his act he misses a catch and falls to the ground. She rushes to help him, but then the ground beneath them gives way and they fall into the dreamlike world of [[Cirque du Soleil]]. Separated, they travel through the different tent worlds trying to find each other, interacting with the strange and wonderful performers and performances of Cirque du Soleil. Mia and the Aerialist perform an aerial courtship for the grand finale.

'''''Curse of the Pharaoh: The Quest for Nefertiti''''' is an [[ancient Egypt]]-themed [[casual game]] in the [[Adventure Game|adventure]] genre. Set in the 1930s, this game was released by its developer, Canadian studio Ph03nix New Media, for the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]] on March 10, 2008. The first in a series, it was followed by ''Curse of the Pharaoh: Napoleon's Secret'' and ''Curse of the Pharaoh: Tears of Sekhmet''.

==Story==

The story of the game is told through both in-game [[cutscenes]] as well as journal pages that the player must collect. These journal pages allow the player to unravel the story as they work through each of the 53 levels of the game.

The story begins in London of the 1930s. The player takes on the role of Anna, an [[archaeologist]] who discovers a letter from her stepbrother William, asking for her help. William informs Anna that, during his [[exploration|expedition]] in search of the tomb of [[Nefertiti]], he has encountered a terrible plot with implications of a government [[Cabal|conspiracy]] and cover-up. William implies that he is in danger and asks Anna to come looking for him should she not hear from him within two weeks. The game begins with the player attempting to find clues to locate William.

The journal left to Anna by William is incomplete, and during the course of the game, additional pages to that journal will be revealed to the player, outlining William's journeys through the locations the player is playing through, and providing the player with valuable clues.

==Main Gameplay==

''Curse of the Pharaoh'' consists of 53 [[Level (computer and video games)|levels]] in its main gameplay mode, plus 4 [[minigame]] levels. The main gameplay mode includes the three following types of levels:

[[Image:CurseOfThePharaoh ScreenShot FTD.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of a find-the-difference level]]

===Spot the difference levels===
The player must find all 10 differences between the pictures on each side of the screen, additionally the player will collect and keep one such item in their inventory, to be used to solve a puzzle in that level, or some other level within the same world.

==="Secret Room" levels===
The player must locate 4 objects within these rooms. The 4 objects to be found will be indicated by silhouettes that appear in the player's inventory. The player must also find 5 pieces of a mask, when completed this mask will serve as the key to open the following Logic Puzzle Level.

===Logic Puzzle levels===
The player must unlock these levels with mask keys found in "Secret Room" levels. Then he or she must use the objects in his or her inventory to solve the puzzle presented by the room.

==Minigames==

''Curse of the Pharaoh'' includes 4 [[minigame]]s which, can be purchased in the in-game store using coins that the player is expected to collect within levels.

===Simon Says Game===
The player must follow the pattern of lights and complete a certain number of rounds to win.

[[Image:CurseOfThePharaoh ScreenShot MG.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of the scarab minigame]]

===Scarab Game===
(aka [[Concentration (game)|concentration]])
The player must turn over two scarabs at a time, if the symbols on their undersides match, those scarabs are removed from play. The player must clear all the scarabs within 2 minutes. This game has 3 rounds.

===Wack-a-Wipi===
This game requires the player to wack the cartoonish character known as Wipi. Each time Wipi pops up, the speed of the game increases. Also, "fake" Wipis will also pop up to confuse the player. The player must identify the fakes and wack only the real wipis. The player wins if they complete 15 rounds or more without missing wipi once.

=== Push Game ===
The player is presented with 5 statues. Pushing each statue downward will cause the other statues to move up or down. How each statue affects the others differs from statue to statue. The player must solve this puzzle within 2 minutes to win.

{{Music Education|major}}
'''Dalcroze eurhythmics''', also known as the '''Dalcroze method''' or simply '''eurhythmics''', is one of several developmental approaches including the [[Kodály method]], [[Orff Schulwerk]] and [[Suzuki Method]] used to [[music education|teach music]] to students. Eurhythmics was developed in the early 20th century by [[Swiss]] musician and educator [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]]. Dalcroze eurhythmics teaches concepts of rhythm, structure, and musical expression using movement, and is the concept for which Dalcroze is best known. It focuses on allowing the student to gain physical awareness and experience of music through training that takes place through all of the senses, particularly kinesthetic.

Eurhythmics often introduces a musical concept through movement before the students learn about its visual representation. This sequence translates to heightened body awareness and an association of rhythm with a physical experience for the student, reinforcing concepts kinesthetically. Eurhythmics has wide-ranging applications and benefits and can be taught to a variety of age groups. Eurhythmics classes for all ages share a common goal – to provide the music student with a solid rhythmic foundation through movement in order to enhance musical expression and understanding. The origin of the word "Eurhythmics" is "[[eurythmy]]" + "-ics".

==Émile Jaques-Dalcroze and the origins of eurhythmics==

Jaques-Dalcroze was appointed Professor of Harmony at the Conservatoire of Geneva in 1892, early in his career. As he taught his classes, he noticed that his students deeply needed an approach to learning music that included a kinesthetic component. He believed that in order to enhance and maximize musical expression, students needed to be trained early on to listen and appreciate music using both their minds and bodies. This coordination of mind and physical instincts formed the basis of his method.

Ready to develop and employ an improved, integrated style of music education at the Conservatoire, Dalcroze discovered some obstacles. He found that students with innate rhythmic abilities were rare, just as those with "perfect," or absolute pitch are. In response to his observations, he asserted that in order to develop rhythmic ability in his students, he must first, and as early as possible in their development, train them in exercises that utilized the entire body. Only when the student's muscles and motor skills were developed could they be properly equipped to interpret and understand musical ideas. As he mentioned in the foreword of his "Rhythm, Music, and Education," he sought the "connection between instincts for pitch and movement…time and energy, dynamics, and space, music and character, music and temperament, [and] finally the art of music and the art of dancing.”

Because of the nature of his goals in expanding music education, his ideas are readily applicable to young students. An objective of his was to "musicalize" young children in order to prepare them for musical expression in future instrumental studies. He believed exposure to music, an expanded understanding of how to listen, and the training of gross and fine motor skills would yield faster progress later on in students’ musical studies. Related to this was his goal to sow the seeds of musical appreciation for future generations.

As stated concisely by Claire-Lise Dutoit in her "Music Movement Therapy," successful eurhythmics lessons have the following three attributes in common:

“The vital enjoyment of rhythmic movement and the confidence that it gives; the ability to hear, understand and express music in movement; [and] the call made on the pupil to improvise and develop freely his own ideas.”

==Influences on the development of eurhythmics==

Before taking a post teaching theory, [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]] spent a year as a conductor in Algiers, where he was exposed to a rhythmic complexity that helped influence him to pay special attention to rhythmic aspects of music.

Jaques-Dalcroze also had an important friendship with [[Édouard Claparède]], the renowned psychologist. In particular, their collaboration resulted in eurhythmics often employing games of change and quick reaction in order to focus attention and increase learning.

==Current applications==

'''General Education'''

Eurhythmics classes are often offered as an addition to general education programs, whether in preschools, grade schools, or secondary schools. In this setting, the objectives of eurhythmics classes are to introduce students with a variety of musical backgrounds to musical concepts through movement without a specific performance-related goal.

For younger students, eurhythmics activities often imitate play. Games include musical storytelling, which associates different types of music with corresponding movements of the characters in a story. The youngest of students, who are typically experiencing their first exposure to musical knowledge in a eurhythmics class, learn to correlate types of notes with familiar movement; for example the quarter note is represented as a "walking note." As they progress, their musical vocabulary is expanded and reinforced through movement.

'''Performance-Based Applications'''

While eurhythmics classes can be taught to general populations of students, they are also effective when geared toward music schools, either preparing students to begin instrumental studies or serving as a supplement to students who have already begun musical performance.

==Aspects of a rhythmic curriculum==

'''Vocabulary'''

Eurhythmics classes for students in elementary school through college and beyond can benefit from a rhythmic curriculum that explores rhythmic vocabulary. This vocabulary can be introduced and utilized in a number of different ways, but the primary objective of this component is to familiarize students with rhythmic possibilities and expand their horizons. Activities such as rhythmic dictation, composition, and the performance of rhythmic canons and polyrhythms can accommodate a wide range of meters and vocabulary. In particular, vocabulary can be organized according to number of subdivisions of the pulse.

'''Movement'''

A key component of a rhythmic education, movement provides another way of reinforcing rhythmic concepts - kinesthetic learning serves as a supplement to visual and aural learning. While the study of traditional classroom music theory reinforces concepts visually and encourages students to develop aural skills, the study of eurhythmics solidifies these concepts through movement. In younger students, the movement aspect of a rhythmic curriculum also develops musculature and gross motor skills. Ideally, most activities that are explored in eurhythmics classes should include some sort of kinesthetic reinforcement.

'''Meter and Syncopation'''

Another element of a rhythmic curriculum is the exploration of meter and syncopation. In particular, the study of meter should incorporate an organization of pulses and subdivisions. This organization can be expressed in a "meter chart," which can include both equal-beat and unequal-beat meters.

The study of syncopation, a broad term that can involve a variety of rhythms that fall unexpectedly or somehow displace the pulse, is also essential in a rhythmic education. Eurhythmics classes can incorporate various activities to explore syncopation, including complex rhythmic dictations, the performance of syncopated rhythms, the exploration of syncopated rhythms in canon, and a general discussion of syncopated vocabulary.

==Sample activities==

Ages 3–6:
* Warm-up activities: The students isolate and shake each body part, each one accompanied by different music. 
* Notes: Students learn about musical notation through associated movements. For example, quarter notes would be taught as “walking notes”. After familiarity with associated movements, note names are then introduced.
* Storytelling: The teacher invents a story or uses a familiar storyline to incorporate rhythmic concepts
* Ball games: Students pass a ball around in different ways, exploring naturally occurring rhythm and developing motor skills
* Games with sticks: The students jump across a series of sticks on the floor, learning to coordinate body parts and their associated rhythm.
* Drum activities: The students participate with small drums, getting to reproduce rhythm in an instrumental context

Ages 7+ (activities can be adapted to different age groups) 
* Swings: The teacher plays music improvised in a preset metrical pattern. The students use prescribed body motions to determine the pattern.
* Rhythmic dictation: The teacher plays a number of measures of music repeatedly, the rhythm of which the students dictate.
* Rhythms: Students clap or step a predetermined rhythmic pattern. The teacher can experiment with augmentation and diminution.
* Small group activities: Students work together in small groups to accomplish rhythmic tasks, encouraging cooperation. 
* Ball games: Students pass a ball around in different ways, exploring naturally occurring rhythm and developing motor skills.
* Tempos: Students work to discover different tempos that can be applied to classical repertoire, familiar songs, or everyday movements. The teacher can also lead in experimenting with tempo relationships and adjustment.
* Polyrhythms: The teacher establishes two rhythms to be performed at once, one in the hands and one in the feet.
* Cross rhythms:  Students produce one even rhythm in the hands against another even rhythm in the feet. The teacher prompts them to switch which rhythm is produced in each body part.
* “Cosmic Whole Note”: Students listen to a slow pulse (an example would be 6 beats per minute), subdivide the space between sounds, and predict when the next pulse sounds by clapping.
* Canon: Students listen to rhythmic vocabulary performed by the teacher and step this vocabulary in canon. This activity can be executed in a variety of meters. 
* “Microbeats”: Students learn syllables to represent 1-9 subdivisions of a beat. Associated activities could include performing microbeats in prescribed patterns, at varying tempi, in canon, or as sight-reading.

==Effectiveness of Dalcroze eurhythmics==
A group of 72 pre-school children were tested on their rhythmic ability; half of the children had free-play (35–40 min.) twice a week for a 10-week period while the other half had rhythmic movement classes for the same amount of time. The group that had classes (experimental group) did significantly better than the group that just had free-play (control group). The experiment group scored four or more points better in every area tested than the control group in the final test. This shows that eurhythmic classes can benefit a child’s sense of rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;Zachopoulou, Evridiki, Vassiliki Drri, Dimitris Chatzopoulou, Theordoros Elinoudis.

They relied on the exaggerated and highly stylized portrayal of stereotypes, usually based on [[ethnic humor]]. The genre has its roots on the vaudeville stage and in the minstrel shows that became popular in the 19th century. The ethnicities of the actual actors portraying the dialects did not have to match the characters; while much Jewish dialect comedy was created and portrayed by actual Jews, other dialect comedies, such as those involving [[blackface]], were often not.

[[File:Amos 'n' Andy male cast 1951.jpg|thumb|Cast of the Amos N Andy television show in 1951]]
	One of the most notable dialect comedies was [[The Goldbergs (broadcast series)|The Goldbergs]], the brain child of creator/star, [[Gertrude Berg]] about a Jewish family living in the Bronx. After its debut in 1929, the series had several incarnations in radio, television and a musical on Broadway. Berg continued to play the character of Molly Goldberg until 1955. In an article in the May 1936 issue of Radio Mirror, in a piece called ''Ghetto guides the Goldbergs'', writer Dan Wheeler describes Berg’s “double life." Berg, the successful actress and business woman takes the reporter to a Jewish Ghetto on New York’s lower East Side where she spends a few hours a week, Gabbing in Yiddish with the old Yentas of the neighborhood about their children and pouring over the vegetable carts that line the streets. This is her inspiration for her characters; Berg emphasized both realism and being a positive role model in portraying the lead character as a [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Radio Mirror (May-Oct 1936)|url = https://archive.org/stream/radiomi00macf#page/n155/mode/2up|website = archive.org|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Probably the most enduring program in this genre, [[Amos N Andy]] had two feet planted firmly in the [[Minstrel show|minstrel]] tradition. In 1928, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, two white performers took their blackface act, Sam N Henry, which they did not have the rights to and changed it to Amos N Andy, which became one of the most popular shows of the time. In 1948 Variety proclaimed the show “a national habit, almost as familiar as radio itself.”
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Variety (October 1948)|url = https://archive.org/stream/variety172-1948-10#page/n95/mode/2up|website = archive.org|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon transitioning the show to television, Gosden and Correll took on the role of producers and hired a black cast including Alvin Childress (Amos), Spencer Williams (Andy) and Tim Moore (as King Fisher); Gosden and Correll had appeared as their characters in blackface on-screen in the 1930 talkie film ''[[Check and Double Check]]'', which received poor reception.
By the time of its final broadcast in 1960, the show had been renamed Amos N Andy Music Hall.

	[[Life with Luigi]] premiered on CBS in 1948 and centered around Luigi Basco, an Italian immigrant living in Chicago. Many of the plots were either about Luigi attending “citizenship classes” and the wacky immigrants he meets there or about his cranky landlord trying to convince Luigi to marry his overweight daughter. The TV version premiered in 1952 and was cancelled shortly after. It was cancelled due to the bumbling helpless portrayal of a character often referred to as “the little immigrant” who didn’t understand how banks work even though there are probably banks in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = St. Petersburg Times - Google News Archive Search|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19521004&amp;id=FQ4kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Kk8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5001,1528184&amp;hl=en|website = news.google.com|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mama (TV series)|Mama]] (alternately “I Remember Mama”) was a series about a Norwegian family living in San Francisco, CA starring Peggy Wood, Judson Laire and Rosemary Rice.

''[[Beulah (series)|Beulah]]'' was a radio series on CBS from 1945–1954 and a TV show on ABC from 1950-1952. It was the first series to feature an African American woman in the main role. Beulah drew much of the same criticism from the black community as Amos N Andy. The show was criticized for its portrayal of the “[[Mammy archetype|Mammy]]” or the happy go lucky black servant who wanted nothing more from life than to serve white folks. When it first hit the radio waves, the character of Beulah was voiced by her creator, [[Marlin Hurt]], a white male; the character was originally introduced nationwide as a supporting character on ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'' before getting her own show. After Hurt's unexpected death in 1946, the character of Beulah was played by Bob Corley, another white man. In 1947, African American actress Hattie McDaniel took over, followed by two beautiful African American sisters Lillian Randolph and later Amanda Randolph. The TV version of Beulah was portrayed by Ethel Waters and Louise Beavers.

	Jewish performers such as [[George Burns]], [[Jack Benny]] and [[Milton Berle]] had shows that were arguably forms of dialect comedy. Each of these comedians used cultural markers of Jewishness such as incorporating [[Yiddish]] words and phrases into their dialogue and referencing places that were known for being Jewish neighborhoods such as New York’s East side. Comedians like Berle and others had come out of the same vaudeville tradition as the minstrel performers and as such did their shows in a classic variety format which included characters who were often based on racial and ethnic stereotypes. As late as the 1990s, the work of [[Jerry Seinfeld]] was seen as having a distinctly New York Jewish flavor to it, which initially hindered his show ''[[Seinfeld]]'' (which later became a smash hit) from being picked up as a series.&lt;ref name=SeinfeldMemo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Seinfeld-Research-Memo-1083639.aspx|work=[[TV Guide]]|author=Battaglio, Stephen|date=June 27, 2014|title=On ''Seinfeld's'' 25th anniversary an exclusive look at the memo that almost killed the show|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often overlooked in modern times were regional dialects that were not directly based on ethnic humor. [[Hillbilly]] humor was a somewhat common form of dialect comedy during the radio era, with shows such as ''[[Lum and Abner]]'' using the genre to full effect. Southerners (especially haughty aristocrats from the South and their distinctive accents) were another target of dialect comedy, with one of the most famous examples being fictional U.S. Senator [[Senator Claghorn|Beauregard Claghorn]] from ''[[Town Hall Tonight|The Fred Allen Show]]''.

Occasional use of dialect comedy continued even after [[political correctness]] led to the dramatic decline of its usage in the 1950s. [[José Jiménez (character)|José Jiménez]], a fictional Bolivian immigrant who was created by non-Hispanic comedian [[Bill Dana]], remained popular as a guest act well into the 1960s; Dana never intended the character to be offensive and [[kill off|killed him off]] in the late 1970s, complete with a mock funeral. The 1980s sitcom ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' included Swedish dialect humor in the form of [[Betty White]]'s [[Rose Nylund]] character, who fit early 20th-century stereotypes of the good-hearted but dense Swede.

'''Docklands Studios Melbourne''' is a major film and television production complex located in [[Melbourne]]’s redeveloped [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]] precinct. The site is located approximately 2 kilometres from [[Melbourne CBD|Melbourne’s Central Business District]]. The complex opened in 2004 and its primary function is to support Victoria's film and television industry and attract international and Australian productions to Melbourne. It is one of three major studios in Australia, the others being [[Village Roadshow Studios]] on the Gold Coast and [[Fox Studios Australia]] in Sydney.

==Facilities==
The studio complex consists of five sound stages with a total area of 6,318 m² (68,000 square feet), various production offices, a workshop divided into bays of different sizes and parking for 800 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Docklands website|url=http://www.dsmelbourne.com/our-facilities/|website=Docklands Studios Melbourne|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound stages vary in size from 2,323 m² (25,000 square feet) to 743 m² (8,000 square feet). They are hired for production of feature films, drama series and audience based television programs as well as television commercials, music videos and corporate events.

==Studio history==
The push for Melbourne to build a major studio complex arose in the late 1990s amid concern that it was "losing some of its media city position to arch rival Sydney and to the Gold Coast".&lt;ref name="Goldsmith"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsmith|first1=Ben|editor1-last=O'Regan|editor1-first=Tom|title=Cinema Cities, Media Cities: The Contemporary International Studio Complex|date=September 2003|publisher=Australian Film Commission|isbn=0958015279|pages=40–42|url=http://afcarchive.screenaustralia.gov.au/downloads/pubs/streport-final.pdf|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strategic objectives were that construction of a major studio complex would represent Melbourne's maturity and global ambitions, develop production capacity to its next stage, and service the needs of the local film and television industry.&lt;ref name="Goldsmith" /&gt; At the time, Melbourne had a number of smaller facilities with sound stages, but did not have a large state-of-the-art complex.&lt;ref name="Goldsmith" /&gt;

==Early years==

Construction began in 2003 on a parcel of land provided by the Victorian government in the Docklands precinct.&lt;ref name="Goldsmith" /&gt; The studios were a partnership between the Victorian government and a private consortium, Central City Studio Holdings. The complex opened in April 2004 under the name Melbourne Central City Studios and that year hosted the Australian feature film production, ''[[Hating Alison Ashley (film)|Hating Alison Ashley]]''. In 2005, the American-backed ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'' became the first international production at the studios and, with a budget of around $120 million, was the biggest feature film ever to be made in Victoria.&lt;ref name="Ziffer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ziffer|first1=Daniel|title=Melbourne in frame gives filmmakers flaming headache|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/melbourne-in-frame-gives-filmmakers-flaming-headache/2007/02/14/1171405295249.html|accessdate=21 January 2017|publisher=The Age|date=15 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the number of international productions in the first few years of operation did not live up to expectations, partly because of the fluctuating Australian dollar.&lt;ref name="Bodey"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bodey|first1=Michael|title=Docklands studios makes it to 10 years|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/film/docklands-studios-melbourne-makes-it-to-10-years/news-story/f118dae7976134f01ab1b4a5246acb93|accessdate=21 January 2017|publisher=The Australian|date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2008 the private consortium withdrew and the Victorian government took control of the facility.&lt;ref name="Bodey" /&gt; In 2009 the Victorian government and the studios commissioned the 'Future Directions' study, which reaffirmed the government's commitment to retaining ownership of the facility and led to a $10 million infrastructure upgrade.&lt;ref name="Quinn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quinn|first1=Karl|title=Film studio attracts more lights, camera, action|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/film-studio-attracts-more-lights-camera-action-20130224-2eznm.html|accessdate=21 January 2017|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010 the complex changed its name to Docklands Studios Melbourne, formally adopting the name by which the studios were commonly known.&lt;ref name="Chai"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chai|first1=Paul|title=Melbourne studio gets name change|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/news/melbourne-studio-gets-name-change-1118025557/|accessdate=21 January 2017|publisher=Variety|date=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the [[Nine Network]] announced plans to relocate its television production to Docklands Studios, following the closure of its outmoded facility in Bendigo Street, Richmond.&lt;ref name="Knox"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knox|first1=David|title=GTV 9 to rent Docklands Studios|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2010/10/gtv9-to-rent-docklands-studios.html|accessdate=21 January 2017|publisher=TV Tonight|date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent history==

Docklands Studios Melbourne is widely used by domestic and international productions. In 2015 the Nine Network renewed its five-year agreement to produce programs at the studios, including ''[[The Footy Show (AFL)|The Footy Show]]'' and ''[[Millionaire Hot Seat]]''. The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and the [[Seven Network]] also use the sound stages, while many Australian films, including ''[[The Dressmaker (2015 film)|The Dressmaker]]'', ''[[Oddball (film)|Oddball]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Ben Hall]]'' have shot scenes at the complex. The lower Australian dollar has helped attract international productions such as HBO's ''[[The Leftovers (TV series)|The Leftovers]].''&lt;ref name="Battersby"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Battersby|first1=Lucy|title=HBO series filmed in Melbourne as government incentives and low dollar work in Australia's favour|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/hbo-series-filmed-in-melbourne-as-government-incentives-and-low-dollar-work-in-australias-favour-20160909-grcy2d.html|accessdate=22 January 2017|publisher=The Age|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex continues to build its reputation as a supporter of indie films, housing three small budget productions in 2017 - The Wheel, Choir Girl, and Guilty - alongside two mainstream feature films ''[[Upgrade (film)|Upgrade]]'' and ''[[Winchester_(film)|Winchester]]''.&lt;ref name="Maddox"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maddox|first1=Garry|title=Saw creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell both heading home with big film plans|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/saw-creators-james-wan-and-leigh-whannell-both-heading-home-with-big-film-plans-20161220-gtewq9.html|accessdate=21 January 2017|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018 the complex is again housing productions of varying size, such as the Australian-Chinese co-production The Whistleblower which is expected to employ 220 local screen workers and spend $40 million in the state's economy. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Groves |first1=Don |title=Australian-Chinese co-production ‘The Whistleblower’ rolls in Melbourne |url=https://www.if.com.au/australian-chinese-co-production-the-whistleblower-rolls-in-melbourne/ |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |publisher=IF Magazine |date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that since opening in 2004, Docklands Studios Melbourne has brought more than $800 million into the Victorian economy.&lt;ref name="Ministerial media release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministerial media release|url=http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/docklands-studios-welcomes-new-chair/|website=Premier of Victoria|accessdate=21 January 2017|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are long-term expansion plans for the studios, including construction of a sixth sound stage and new workshops.&lt;ref name="Quinn"/&gt; Since 2009 the CEO of the complex has been former film producer and former [[Fox Studios Australia]] Director of Operations, Rod Allan.

'''''Drive-In Massacre''''' is a 1976 [[horror film]] written and directed by Stu Segall, and co-written by John F. Goff and [[George Buck Flower]].

== Plot ==

A couple go to a [[drive-in theater]] in a rural [[California]] town, and are butchered by an unseen assailant, who uses a sword to decapitate the man, and skewer the woman through the neck. Investigating this dual homicide are police detectives Mike Leary and John Koch, who interview the drive-in's boorish manager, Austin Johnson, and the odd [[Janitor|custodian]], Germy. Germy mentions that a [[Voyeurism|peeping tom]] likes to cruise the area to watch couples and lone girls, and he is told to try and write down the voyeur's license plate number the next time he sees him.

That night, the killer strikes again, impaling two lovers while they are making out in their vehicle, and leaving a sword behind. To see if the sword belongs to the missing drive-in owner, Germy is brought in to the police station identify it. Germy states that the sword is not a part of the owner's private collection, and tells the detectives that the voyeur was at the drive-in around the time of the latest double murder, and that he managed to write down the man's license plate number. The plate number is connected to Orville Ingleson, whose home the detectives visit. Orville denies any connection to the deaths, but when a bloody cloth is found in his car, he panics, and tries to make a run for it. Orville is caught, and claims the blood was just from a dog he accidentally ran over, which is confirmed by further analysis, forcing the police to let him go.

That evening, the detectives (one of them disguised as a woman) go to a screening at the drive-in, and spot Orville there, even though he had promised to stay away from it. After a customer who had stormed off when his girlfriend refused his advances returns to his car, he discovers that his girlfriend has been beheaded. Leary and Koch rush to Orville's car, and find him dead from a slit throat. Austin and Germy are brought in the station for questioning, and Austin antagonizes the detectives, refusing to close the drive-in without a [[court order]], and firing Germy.

The following evening, Leary and Koch get a call about a [[machete]]-wielding man who has just murdered two people being cornered in a warehouse, with a little girl he has taken hostage. The detectives go to the warehouse, and after a chase and stand off, shoot the man dead, learning afterward that he was a mental patient who had escaped only a few hours ago, and thus he cannot be the [[serial killer]].

At the drive-in, Germy collects his things, and goes to the [[projection booth]] to confront Austin about which one of them gets to keep the owner's sword collection, and about money he is owed. As soon as Germy enters the booth, the silhouette of Austin being killed with a sword is projected onto the drive-in's screen while a Wild West movie is being featured. Leary and Koch (who want to talk to Austin) arrive just in time to see this, and break into the booth, where they find both Austin and Germy hacked to pieces and the killer gone with no trace.

The film suddenly comes to an abrupt end where an on-screen text states that other drive-ins throughout the country are now being plagued by similar bloodbaths, and that the killer's identity is still unknown. A fake [[public address]] then announces that a psychopath is loose in the viewer's own drive-in theater, and urges the audience not to panic, as the police are on their way.

== Reception ==

A score of two out of four was given by [[TV Guide]], which wrote "Obviously inspired by [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s masterful ''[[Targets]]'', ''Drive-In Massacre'' has none of its predecessor's insight, intelligence, or craft. Instead, it's an ultracheap slice-and-dice effort that even boasts the tired 'They're coming to get you!' ending designed to make drive-in audiences uncomfortable. Needless to say, the effect is greatly diminished on home video".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://movies.tvguide.com/drive-in-massacre/review/113579|title = ''Drive-In Massacre'' Review|author = |publisher = TV Guide|date = |work = Drive-In Massacre|accessdate = May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oh, the Horror! said the film was "a technical nightmare on all levels"  and concluded "Aside from a great opening double death sequence, there really isn't enough happening in the film to recommend it. It's an oddity, but one not worth much more than a single curious glance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://oh-the-horror.com/page.php?id=214|title = ''Drive-In Massacre'' (1976)|author = Wes R.|publisher = Oh, the Horror!|date = May 14, 2008|work = Drive-In Massacre|accessdate = May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Parte del Elenco de Enchufe.tv.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the cast of '' Enchufe.tv '' in 2015.]]
In 2011, Ecuadorian filmmakers Leonardo Robalino, Christian Moya, Martín Domínguez and Jorge Ulloa discussed the current state of audiovisual production in Ecuador in the back of a pickup truck.&lt;ref name="EXPRESIONESGENTE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expresiones.ec/ediciones/2012/10/23/gente/nacional/la-tv-les-dijo-no-pero-78-millones-de-vistas-les-dicen-si/ |title=Expresiones - La TV les dijo no, pero 78 millones de vistas dicen sí |publisher=Expresiones.ec |date=2012-10-23 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BaldeCamioneta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diario-extra.com/ediciones/2012/05/12/farandula/humor-ecuatoriano-en-enchufe-tv/ |title=Extra.ec - Humor ecuatoriano en Enchufe TV |publisher=Diario-extra.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they decided to begin production of short videos,&lt;ref name="EXPRESIONESGENTE"/&gt; using the internet as their primary medium of diffusion with fewer restrictions than traditional media outlets.&lt;ref name="EXPRESIONESGENTE"/&gt;

Shortly thereafter, the audiovisual project commenced as a product of their company, ''Touché Films'',&lt;ref name="EXPRESIONESGENTE"/&gt; and on November 13, 2011,&lt;ref name="Enchufados"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.prensalibre.com/revista_d/Enchufados_0_959904221.html |title=¡Enchufados! |publisher=Prensalibre.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ElTeleSinDe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/cultura1/item/enchufe-tv-nos-reimos-de-nosotros-mismos-sin-denigrar.html |title=Enchufe TV: "Nos reímos de nosotros mismos, sin denigrar" |publisher=Telegrafo.com.ec |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Enchufe.tv''  [[YouTube]] channel was created, publishing various comedy sketches, ''El peor casting''&lt;ref name="EXPRESIONESGENTE"/&gt; (The Worst Casting) being their first.&lt;ref name="PrimerVideo"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.elcomercio.com/entretenimiento/EnchufeTV-pagina-web_0_742725861.html |title=EnchufeTV ya tiene su página en la web |publisher=Elcomercio.com |date=2012-07-25 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their first season, sketches lasting 4 to 5 minutes were uploaded every Sunday, while shorts known as "microYAPA" (between 10 and 60 seconds) were uploaded on Tuesdays. Every Thursday a "Promo" was released, providing a preview of the upcoming Sunday sketch.&lt;ref name="Enchufados"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Promo"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.elcomercio.com.ec/entretenimiento/Enchufe-TV-expone-comicas-situaciones_0_661733901.html |title=Enchufe TV expone cómicas situaciones |publisher=Elcomercio.com.ec |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 2012, the Enchufe.tv YouTube channel reached 71,000 subscribers&lt;ref name="PrimerVideo"/&gt; and their videos received over 78 million views,&lt;ref name="EXPRESIONESGENTE"/&gt; racking up 500,000 hits per day&lt;ref name="EXPRESIONESGENTE"/&gt; making them the most popular Ecuadorian [[YouTube]] channel on the web.&lt;ref name="EXPRESIONESGENTE"/&gt; Until mid-2012, viewership came primarily from [[Ecuador]], followed by [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="EXPRESIONESGENTE"/&gt; On April 16, 2012, the protagonist of Pescador, [[Andrés Crespo (actor)|Andrés Crespo]], made a guest appearance in the skit with ''Las Amigas de Camilo con Blanquito''.&lt;ref name="BaldeCamioneta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanquito"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.elcomercio.com/entretenimiento/Risas-distension-rigurosidad-rodaje-EnchufeTV_0_716328448.html |title=Risas, distensión y rigurosidad en un rodaje de EnchufeTV |publisher=Elcomercio.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 2012, the Mothers Day video ''Mami, mami, mami'', reached a record of 3.2 million visitors.&lt;ref name="MAMI"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.elcomercio.com/entretenimiento/Enchufe_TV-Youtube-Dia_de_las_Madres-Mami-mami-mami-Silvana_Di_Mella_0_916708441.html |title=‘Mami, mami, mami’ de Enchufe TV rompe récord de visita |publisher=Elcomercio.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016070651/http://www.elcomercio.com/entretenimiento/Enchufe_TV-Youtube-Dia_de_las_Madres-Mami-mami-mami-Silvana_Di_Mella_0_916708441.html |archivedate=2013-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, 2012 Enchufe.tv published a video called ''ME GUSTA'', reaching 1.5 million views in less than 48 hours and inspiring approximately 100 video responses, becoming a trending video from [[Russia]] to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="CampusParty"/&gt; On October 8, 2012 the ''Compra Condones'' sketch was released, eventually becoming the most viral video they had released, reaching over 10 million views to date.&lt;ref name="CampusParty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EcuaEnchufe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecuavisa.com/articulo/entretenimiento/produccion-tv/41550-trabajo-detras-enchufetv |title=El trabajo detrás de EnchufeTv |language=es |publisher=Ecuavisa |date=2013-09-19 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sketches of Note==
[[File:Orlando Herrera.jpg|thumb|Orlando Herrera.]]
[[File:Raúl Santana.jpg|thumb|Raúl Santana.]]
[[File:MOSQUITO MOSQUERA.jpg|thumb|Mosquito Mosquero]]
#'''''The Worst Casting''''':  The first sketch Touché Films ever made for Enchufe.tv.  It is about the goings on and unique situations that casting presents.&lt;ref name="EXPRESIONESGENTE"/&gt;
#'''''Mission: Carnaval (Ecuadorian FPS)''''':  In this parody of the first person shooter video game [[Call of Duty]] using the national celebration of [[carnival|carnaval]] as the backdrop, water balloons, eggs, flour and water pistols are used in place of firearms to attack the passers by.
#'''''Mommy mommy mommy (Mother’s Day)''''':  This sketch is about a mother who can’t tolerate the constant bother her son causes her with his non-stop questioning about any and everything, in addition to his bad grades.  During an attempt to trap and punish him, he gives her a Mother’s Day card reminding her that he loves her.  The sketch ends with a hug between mother and son.&lt;ref name="MAMI"/&gt;
#'''''Camilo’s amigas with Blanquito''''':  Three rowdy teenage girls try to socialize with local celebrity [[Andrés Crespo (actor)|Andrés Crespo]], who plays the protagonist Blanquito of the Ecuadorian film “Pescador” while riding in his car.  They get him into trouble with the authorities by having alcohol in his car and drinking underage.  The sketch ends with a session of selfies during Crespo’s arrest.&lt;ref name="Blanquito"/&gt;
#'''''ME GUSTA''''':  This is the first video to step outside of the normal structure of the average Enchufe.tv sketch.  In this video whenever someone likes a particular thing or situation they are ambushed by a character with the well-known [[Internet meme|meme]] [[rage comic]] ME GUSTA face in place of their head.  This character is always accompanied by the same song, and after spitting on a normal person’s face with the rage comic LOL face, the normal person is transformed into the same kind of ME GUSTA character as the original one from the beginning of the video.  After the transformation they both dance in the same peculiar manner.  At the end a lady who happens to be cooking hits the ME GUSTA guy on the head with a pan after she expresses her liking of what she was doing.  The ME GUSTA guy is left on the floor with blood on his face.&lt;ref name="CampusParty"/&gt;
#'''''Buying Condoms''''': Chichico, a young man who goes to the pharmacy somewhat shamefully, needs to buy condoms for the first time.  Although he attempts to do so cautiously, it seems as if everyone around him becomes aware of and involved in what he is attempting to buy, including his uncle who happens to be there too.  It turns out that he is the millionth customer that day, and a camera crew broadcasts his purchase nationwide.  His girlfriend’s father sees the broadcast, and forbids his daughter from seeing Chichico further.  When he shamefully returns to the car to give his friend the condoms he had asked for, the friend replies that he asked not for condoms, or “condones” in Spanish, but for “cordones” (Spanish for shoelaces), thus the entire affair could have been averted if not for a tragic misunderstanding.
#'''''Trailer, Chavo the Movie''''':  This sketch is a parody trailer for a fake movie spinoff based on the Mexican sitcom [[El Chavo del Ocho]].  It is also a tribute to [[Roberto Gomez Bolaños]].  It has a similar plot to [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]].  The sketch features two agents, one American and the other Middle Eastern.  The agents are searching for the real name of El Chavo.  The trailer also briefly explores the darker and perhaps more sexual sides of the beloved sitcom characters.  The trailer ends with the American agent discovering the classic squeaky hammer in the desert.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25735">The '''gun barrel sequence''' is the signature device featured in nearly every [[List of James Bond films|''James Bond'' film]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Cork, John &amp; Scivally, Bruce (2002). ''James Bond: The Legacy''. Boxtree, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Shot from the point of view of a presumed [[assassination|assassin]], it features James Bond walking, turning, and then shooting directly at camera, causing blood to run down the screen. The visuals are usually accompanied by the "[[James Bond Theme]]", written by [[Monty Norman]].

Originally designed by [[Maurice Binder]], the sequence has featured in every [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' film]] produced by [[Eon Productions]] and, although retaining the same basic elements, it has evolved noticeably throughout the series.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Alan &amp; Hearn, Marcus (2000). ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang: The Unofficial James Bond Companion''. Batsford, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most immediately recognisable elements of the franchise and has featured heavily in marketing material for the films and [[List of James Bond parodies and spin-offs|their spin-offs]].

The British [[media studies|media historian]] [[James Chapman (media historian)|James Chapman]] suggests that the sequence is a significant part of the James Bond [[mythology|mythos]] because it "foregrounds the motif of looking, which is central to the spy genre."&lt;ref name="chapman"/&gt;

==Description==
In all but a couple of films, the sequence begins with a white dot blinking across the screen, from left to right. Upon reaching the right edge of the frame, the dot opens up to reveal a [[gun barrel]]'s interior. From the [[Point of view shot|point of view]] of an off-screen assassin, the camera follows James Bond as he walks from right to left against a white background.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;Pfeiffer, Lee &amp; Lisa, Philip (1995). ''The Incredible World of 007: An Authorized Celebration of James Bond''. Boxtree, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Suddenly aware of being observed, he stops at the centre of the screen, quickly turns to the camera and shoots his gun towards it. A blood-red wash, representing the gunman bleeding, runs down the screen. The gun barrel dissolves to a white dot which moves from side-to-side across the screen and settles in the corner. With a few exceptions, the circle then either shrinks and disappears, or fades from white to a circular cutout of the first scene, expanding to reveal the full view of the scene shortly thereafter. However, in recent years, the barrel doesn't dissolve or move. After the blood runs down, everything simply fades out.

==Origins==
[[File:Zuege.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A .38 [[Caliber|calibre]] gun barrel with its six-sided rifling, similar to the gun barrel shown in the movies.]]
[[Image:Great train robbery still.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The 1903 film [[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|''The Great Train Robbery'']], acted out by [[Justus D. Barnes]], may have influenced the James Bond gun barrel sequence.&lt;ref name="chapman"/&gt;]]
The sequence was created by [[Maurice Binder]] for the opening titles of the first Bond film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', in 1962. Binder originally planned to employ a camera sighted down the barrel of a [[.380 ACP|.38 calibre]] gun, but this caused some problems. Unable to stop down the lens of a standard camera enough to bring the entire gun barrel into focus, Binder created a [[pinhole camera]] to solve the problem and the barrel became crystal clear.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt;

Binder described the genesis of the gun barrel sequence in the last interview he recorded before his death in 1991:
{{Quote box|align = center|width = 50%|That was something I did in a hurry, because I had to get to a meeting with the producers in twenty minutes. I just happened to have little white, price tag stickers and I thought I'd use them as gun shots across the screen. We'd have James Bond walk through and fire, at which point blood comes down onscreen. That was about a twenty-minute storyboard I did, and they said, "This looks great!"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;}}

The media historian [[James Chapman (media historian)|James Chapman]] observed that the sequence recalls the gun fired at the audience at the end of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903).&lt;ref name="chapman"&gt;Chapman, James (2000). ''Licence to Thrill: A Cultural History of the James Bond Films''. Columbia, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of the sequence==

[[File:Dr No trailer.jpg|275px|thumb|right|Bob Simmons in ''Dr. No'']]

===Sean Connery===

====1962–1964====
Because Binder had designed the gun barrel sequence to feature Bond only in silhouette, with a non-widescreen [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], he used [[stunt performer|stunt man]] [[Bob Simmons (stunt man)|Bob Simmons]], rather than [[Sean Connery]], to film the scene.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;

Simmons hops slightly as he pivots to assume the firing position and, following the blood wash, the dot becomes smaller and jumps to the lower right-hand corner of the frame before simply vanishing.

In ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', the white dot stops mid-screen and the credit line "[[Harry Saltzman]] &amp; [[Albert R. Broccoli]] present" appears across the dot. The text is wiped and the dot continues the sequence. The sequence is accompanied by a soundtrack of electronic noises and then numerous notes that sound like they are being plinked from a wind-up [[Jack-in-the-box (toy)|jack in the box]]; the latter is cut short by the gunshot. The "[[James Bond Theme]]" then plays very loudly, albeit with the first portion, featuring the theme's plucked electric guitar riff, truncated. The gun barrel sequence in ''Dr. No'' segues directly into the credits, a grid matrix of large-scale, bright and rapidly changing coloured circular dots against a black background. This version, without the electronic noises or the Saltzman-Broccoli credit line, was also used in ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' and ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' which fades into the pre-credit sequence.

====1965–1967====
For ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of the films was changed to a [[Panavision]] [[anamorphic format]] and so the gun barrel sequence had to be reshot, this time with Sean Connery in the role.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Andy &amp; Simpson, Paul (1998). ''The Bond Files: The Unofficial Guide to the World's Greatest Secret Agent''. Virgin, 145.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first gun barrel sequence in which the white dot segues to the film's pre-credit sequence, opening up to reveal the entirety of the scene.

Connery wobbles slightly while firing his gun as he adjusts his balance from an unstable position and he bends over to fire. Although the sequence was shot in colour for ''Thunderball'', it is rendered in black and white for ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''.

===1969 (George Lazenby)===
With a new actor, [[George Lazenby]], in the role of James Bond for ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969), a third sequence had to be filmed. As with ''Thunderball'', the sequence was once again shot in colour.

In this rendering, the white dot stops mid-screen and the credit line "Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli Present" appears, much as it did in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''. The James Bond theme keeps playing though. As the barrel begins to move and when it stops centre-screen, Bond is walking to position for around a second before turning and shooting as the camera tracks with him, resulting in a "[[treadmill]]" effect. Lazenby is the only Bond who kneels down to fire; this is also the only version where the descending blood completely erases Bond's image, leaving only the red circle. In this version, the gun barrel is awash with prismatic splashes of light.

===1971 (Sean Connery)===
When Sean Connery returned to the role of Bond for ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971), the gun barrel sequence filmed for ''Thunderball'' was used. As with ''You Only Live Twice'', the sequence was rendered in black and white, but was given a bluish tint. As in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'', the barrel is awash with prismatic splashes of light, which this time ripple through it. Unlike ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'', the splashes of light are erased by the descending blood. This was the last time the sequence was rendered in black and white until ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006). It is also the last gun barrel sequence in which Bond wears a hat.

===Roger Moore===

====1973–1974====
With the introduction of [[Roger Moore]], and the use of a 1.85:1 matted aspect ratio, a fourth sequence was shot. It was used for just two films: ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' and ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''. Moore wears a business suit and, unlike Simmons, Connery and Lazenby, uses both hands instead of one hand to fire his gun, his left hand bracing his gun arm.
This is the first gun barrel sequence in which Bond is not wearing a hat. Additional footage of this sequence was shot of Bond walking straight towards the camera, putting his face into view, seen in the theatrical trailer.
The dots that start the gun barrel in ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' are blue but in subsequent releases the dots are white.

====1977–1985====
The anamorphic format was reinstated for ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', necessitating a fifth version of the sequence. Moore's Bond wears a [[tuxedo|dinner suit]] ([[tuxedo]]) rather than a business suit and again uses both hands to fire his gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjnewton.demon.co.uk/bond/tswlm.htm|title=The Spy Who Loved Me|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rendering would feature in all Moore's subsequent films in the series, for a total of five appearances, the most uses of the same footage to date. In this version of the sequence, unlike previous and later incarnations, the prop gun held by the actor is never actually fired until ''[[Octopussy]]'', as can be determined by the lack of [[gunsmoke]] in the freeze-frame. It is also noticeable that the background of this version of the sequence is tinted, rather than the usual white. The tint changes with every Moore film. ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', for example, features an [[Eggshell (color)|eggshell]] tinted background whereas the background in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' has a strong shade of [[Buff (colour)|buff]].

===1987–1989 (Timothy Dalton)===
A new gun barrel sequence was shot due to the change in actor from [[Roger Moore]] to [[Timothy Dalton]] and was used for both of Dalton's films. Dalton walks swiftly with a slight bounce before sharply spinning and firing. Dalton crouches down slightly when he fires. Unlike Moore, Dalton shoots one-handed. [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] orchestrates the music for the gun barrel in ''[[The Living Daylights (1987 film)|The Living Daylights]]'' (1987) but [[Michael Kamen]] composes a different orchestration for ''[[Licence To Kill (1989 film)|Licence To Kill]]'' (1989). This was the last gun barrel sequence to be designed by [[Maurice Binder]] before his death in 1991.

===1995–2002 (Pierce Brosnan)===
Following Maurice Binder's death in 1991, [[Daniel Kleinman]] became the designer of the Bond opening graphics. Beginning with ''[[GoldenEye]]'' (1995), the barrel was [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] (but still resembles the original images of the barrel itself) emphasising light and shade variations in the rifling spiral as the reflected light shifts with the gun's movement. Like Dalton, Brosnan shoots one-handed. Unlike the previous Bonds, he remains bolt upright as he fires, with his gun arm extended straight at the camera. The blood in this sequence is noticeably darker and falls faster than in previous incarnations; in keeping with this new pace, the main melody line of the James Bond theme is omitted in two of Brosnan's gun barrel sequences, ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' and ''The World Is Not Enough''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} In prior versions of the sequence, the white dot would open up to reveal the gun barrel before it reaches the right edge of the screen; in all four of Brosnan's films, however, the dot continues moving right until it disappears off screen. Then the gun barrel scrolls in leftward from off screen.

The teaser trailer for ''GoldenEye'' featured its own gun barrel sequence in which Bond, appearing in shadow, quickly shoots away the onscreen text to only leave "007". Bond walks into the foreground, revealing Brosnan's face and proclaiming "You were expecting someone else?", introducing him as the newest actor to play Bond since 1989.

In ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002), [[Lee Tamahori]], the film's director requested a CG bullet be added into the sequence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagedissectors.com/article/128|title=An Analysis of Bond Title Sequences: Die Another Day|accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debrief.commanderbond.net/topic/17239-blast-from-the-past-tamahori-on-die-another-day/|title=Blast From the Past: Tamahori on DIE ANOTHER DAY|accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246460/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=IMDB Trivia: Die Another Day|accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is seen zooming from Bond's gun at the screen and disappearing, suggesting that Bond has fired straight into his opponent's weapon. This was the last gun barrel sequence where Bond wears a dinner suit and the last one until ''Spectre'' where the sequence is placed at the beginning.

===Daniel Craig===

====2006====
The gun barrel sequence was revised again for [[Daniel Craig]]'s first portrayal of Agent 007 in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006). Unlike previous installments, the gun barrel sequence does not open the film as a standalone segment; it is part of the plot. Having seemingly committed the first kill on his way to becoming a [[00 Agent|Double-O agent]], Bond stops to pick up his gun from the floor but his victim, [[List of James Bond henchmen in Casino Royale#Fisher|Fisher]], who is a [[henchman]] of rogue MI6 section chief [[List of James Bond henchmen in Casino Royale#Dryden|Dryden]], recovers and seizes his own weapon. As Fisher brings his pistol up to shoot Bond in the back, the frame shifts instantly to the gun barrel perspective; Bond spins around to outshoot his opponent.

This sequence differs considerably from previous versions: it is incorporated into the film's narrative; it begins with Bond standing stationary (although he was walking toward the door before stooping and turning); it is not filmed against a blank white void and it includes the person whom Bond shoots. In keeping with the [[black-and-white]] theme of the pre-title sequence of the film, it is also the first to be presented in monochrome since ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971) and the first in which Bond is wearing neither a business suit nor a dinner suit, but is dressed casually. Like Dalton and Brosnan, Craig shoots one-handed.

Furthermore, the computer-generated rifling is [[Marlin Firearms#MicroGroove Rifling|microgroove]] rather than the traditional eight rifling grooves, and the blood comes down the screen quickly, not in a wave, but in [[stream|rivulets]]. This is also the first gun barrel sequence without some variation of the "[[James Bond Theme]]" as, instead, it is accompanied by the opening bars of the film's theme song, "[[You Know My Name]]".

====2008==== 
The gun barrel was refilled and edited for 2008's ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''. It reverts to a more traditional style, although the sequence was placed at the end of the film to start the closing credits, due to a final [[cliffhanger]] scene being cut by [[Marc Forster]]. The sequence represents Bond as a blunt and cold-blooded assassin due to the pace of the scene. For example, the white dot travels across the screen much faster than in previous gun barrel sequences, Daniel Craig moves swiftly into position, noticeably faster than its predecessors, and the blood comes down in a large quick wash. Like Dalton and Brosnan, Craig shoots one-handed. The design of the gun barrel is also more simplistic, with a grey colour to it as well as fewer and more widely spaced grooves. The white circle also spins into the centre of the Q in the title graphic for ''Quantum of Solace'', and in the Q, Bond is shown walking away after firing for the first time in the sequence. The closing credits of the film follow.

====2012====
Yet another redesigned gun barrel is used for the film ''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012). Although director [[Sam Mendes]] had originally intended to place the gun barrel at the start of the film, he felt that it would be better placed at the end, as in ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''. The film's opening shot instead harks back to the gun barrel, with Bond emerging into a corridor, pointing his gun directly at the camera, accompanied by the first two notes of the "[[James Bond Theme]]". Mendes recalled, "I tried very hard to put the gun barrel at the beginning and my intention was always to do that. If you see the film, the film starts with Bond walking down a corridor towards camera and lifting a gun. And of course the gun barrel is him walking, stopping and lifting a gun. When I put the two together, it looked ridiculous!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sam Mendes Talks About Wanting To Open 'Skyfall' With The Traditional James Bond Gun Barrel Sequence|url=http://www.flicksandbits.com/2012/11/06/sam-mendes-talks-about-wanting-to-open-skyfall-with-the-traditional-james-bond-gun-barrel-sequence/33649/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110002552/http://www.flicksandbits.com/2012/11/06/sam-mendes-talks-about-wanting-to-open-skyfall-with-the-traditional-james-bond-gun-barrel-sequence/33649/|archivedate=2012-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like with ''Quantum of Solace'', the blood is dark red and runs down the frame in rivulets. However, Bond moves across the screen substantially slower (at a similar speed to the pre-''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' sequences). Unlike all previous gun barrel openings, Craig swings both his arms as he walks, resulting in a partial glimpse of his gun before he turns to fire. After the blood runs down the frame, the screen fades to black, before being replaced by a title card with a small gun barrel logo celebrating fifty years of Bond films and the text "James Bond Will Return" underneath. This gun barrel sequence is the first time Bond has worn a business suit instead of a tuxedo since Roger Moore's original sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watt|first=Andrew|title=Skyfall (2012)|url=http://www.burtonmail.co.uk/Whats-On/Film-and-TV/Skyfall-2012-30102012.htm|newspaper=[[Burton Mail]]|date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig shoots one-handed.

====2015====
The gun barrel is placed at the immediate opening of ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', the first time since ''[[Die Another Day]]'' that a Bond film has opened with the gun barrel. The gun barrel design is similar to that of the original Maurice Binder era and the Pierce Brosnan era, only sharper. Daniel Craig moves at an average speed (again swinging both of his arms as he walks, but this time resulting in his gun being made much more prominently visible), before spinning, facing the camera and firing, to which the lighting grows darker: it silhouettes Bond's figure and the blood runs down the screen, looking similar but noticeably slower than in ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' and ''[[Skyfall]]''. Craig shoots one-handed.

==Costume==
From ''Dr. No'' to ''Diamonds Are Forever'', the gun barrel sequences by Bob Simmons, Sean Connery, and George Lazenby feature James Bond in a [[business suit]] and [[trilby]]. For his first two films, Roger Moore's Bond continues this tradition but without the hat. The following films, beginning with ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (1977), feature Bond in [[black tie]], wearing a dinner suit ([[tuxedo]]). It also continued from ''Moonraker'' (1979) to ''Die Another Day'' (2002). In ''Casino Royale'', Daniel Craig's James Bond is the first shown wearing a more casual ensemble and an open-necked shirt; his attire reverts to a business suit in ''Quantum of Solace'', which is retained for ''Skyfall'' and ''Spectre''.  The ''[[007 Legends]]'' video game tie-in reverts to the dinner suit.

==Music==
The gun barrel sequence is traditionally accompanied by an arrangement of the "[[James Bond Theme]]", a trademark established in ''Dr. No''.

A slightly different version of the theme has been used in each film, often reflecting the styles and locations featured. Some composers have not used the familiar opening bars that punctuate the appearance of the white dots. Others, while retaining them, have felt free to noticeably alter the usual rendition, e.g. [[Michael Kamen]] and [[Éric Serra]], who scored ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' and ''[[GoldenEye]]'' respectively. Kamen's orchestration was a symphonic fanfare, while Serra's arrangement is played by synthesiser.

''Casino Royale'' has the only gun barrel sequence which omits the "James Bond Theme" completely, instead featuring the opening bars of "[[You Know My Name]]" by [[Chris Cornell]]. The "James Bond Theme" returns to accompany the gun barrel sequence in ''Quantum of Solace'', where it continues into the credits. The same goes with ''Skyfall'''s gun barrel, though the theme starts before the sequence in the last scene of the film when the new M gives 007 the dossier for his next mission.

==Other uses==
The gun barrel sequence is widely used in advertisements and merchandise. References to its circular motif regularly appear in the films' trailers. A version of the sequence is used at the start of the 2012 documentary ''Everything or Nothing: The Untold Story of 007'' which showed each Bond composited together, turning and shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Williams interview with director Stevan Riley:  http://www.007magazine.co.uk/news_james_bond_50_eon.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The music videos to the [[James Bond music#Title themes|James Bond title themes]] "[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]", "[[The Living Daylights (song)|The Living Daylights]]", [[Licence to Kill (Gladys Knight song)|"Licence to Kill"]], [[GoldenEye (song)|"GoldenEye",]]  "[[Tomorrow Never Dies (song)|Tomorrow Never Dies]]", "[[Die Another Day (song)|Die Another Day]]" and "[[Another Way to Die]]" each feature their own variation of the gun barrel sequence.

[[File:Never Say Never Again 0001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 007 sequence in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.]]
Because the gun barrel sequence is copyrighted by Eon, the non-Eon Bond film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', released by rival [[Warner Bros.]], instead employed a frame filled with 007's, with the camera zooming into the one in the middle of the screen.

==Video games==
The sequence is commonly used in [[James Bond in video games|James Bond video games]] and their marketing. ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]] uses the gun barrel sequence in the opening titles. A commercial for ''[[007: The World Is Not Enough (Nintendo 64)|The World Is Not Enough]]'' parodied the gun-barrel by replacing Bond with a man who resembled [[List of James Bond allies in GoldenEye#Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky|Valentin Zukovsky]]; he was shot at with a machine-gun before diving off-screen. It was used in a commercial for the video game ''[[James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire|Agent Under Fire]]'' asking, "Do you have what it takes to be Bond?", and showing people trying to repeat the shot, but spoiling the try. ''[[Nightfire]]'' and ''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing|Everything or Nothing]]'' each use a version similar to the Pierce Brosnan films. ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia with Love]]'' uses the Bob Simmons gun barrel from the [[From Russia with Love (film)|film of the same name]]. In the video game adaptation of ''Quantum of Solace'', the gun barrel resembles the one used for ''Casino Royale'', as the game adapts elements from both films.

==Parodies==
{{main|James Bond parodies}}
As with any cultural icon, the gun barrel sequence has inspired numerous [[James Bond parodies|parodies]] and takeoffs since its first appearance in 1962. The sequence has been spoofed in films, sitcoms, cartoons and in advertisements, including: ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', ''[[Logorama]]'',  and ''[[Garfield and Friends]]''. WWE wrestler ''[[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]]'''s entrance is also similar to that of James Bond gun barrel sequence.

In the 1986 horror/comedy film ''[[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives]]'', the opening credits show Jason Voorhees, the main antagonist in the series, emulating the gun barrel sequence by walking across the screen in a Bond-like fashion and then turning to face the camera whilst swinging his signature machete, drenching the screen with blood in a similar manner to the original Bond sequences.

[[File:Heart corazón.svg|thumb|A conventional heart symbol]]
The '''heart shape''' ({{red|♥}}) is an [[ideograph]] used to express the idea of the "heart" in its [[heart (metaphor)|metaphorical]] or [[symbol]]ic sense as the center of [[human emotion|emotion]], including [[affection]] and [[love]], especially [[romantic love]].

The "wounded heart" indicating [[lovesickness]] came to be depicted as a heart symbol pierced with an arrow ([[Cupid]]'s), or heart symbol "broken" in two or more pieces.

==History==

===Origins of symbol===
Greek. In the 6th-5th century BC, the heart shape was used to represent the heart-shaped fruit of the plant [[Silphium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Favorito|first=E. N.|last2=Baty |first2=K.|date=February 1995|title=The Silphium Connection|journal=Celator|volume=9|issue=2|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a plant possibly used as a contraceptive&lt;ref name ="Straight Dope"&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/061013.html ''Did the ancient Romans use a natural herb for birth control?''], [[The Straight Dope]],  October 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Many species in the [[Apiaceae|parsley family]] have [[estrogen]]ic properties, and some, such as [[wild carrot]], were used to induce abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance|first1=John M.|last1=Riddle|pp=58|publisher=harvard university press|year=1994|isbn=978-0674168763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver coins from Cyrene of the 6–5th BC bear a similar design, sometimes accompanied by a silphium plant and is understood to represent its seed or fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buttrey |first=T. V. |date=Spring–Summer 1992 |url=http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/34-1-2/Buttrey.pdf |title=The Coins and the Cult |journal=Expedition |volume=34 |issue=1–2 |pages=59–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that the heart symbol was found in devotion to God. The symbol appears as one rights themselves up, after having prayed with one's head to the ground. The hands form the symbol as one is in the process of standing up. 

===Earliest use===
[[File:Roman de la poire heart metaphor.jpg|thumb|The earliest known visual depiction of a heart symbol, as a lover hands his heart to the beloved lady, in a manuscript of the ''[[Roman de la poire]]'', mid-13th century.]]
The combination of the heart shape and its use within the heart metaphor developed at the end of the [[Middle Ages]], although the shape has been used in many ancient epigraphy monuments and texts.  With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century, the familiar symbol of the heart represented love developed in the 15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp (2011), 96–99.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the 14th century, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in such instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples from antiquity [[Common fig|fig]] leaves, and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of ivy and of the water-lily. One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript, Al-Maqamat written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al Hariri of Basra]]. The manuscript includes an [https://medieval.tumblr.com/image/108488126380 illustration] of a farewell greeting between two men while astride their camels, with the heart shape seen prominently over their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topic.com/the-pleasure-principles|title=The Pleasure Principles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of the French ''[[Roman de la poire]]'' (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's "sweet gaze" or ''douz regart'') offers his heart to a damsel.  The heart here resembles a pine cone (held "upside down", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into "Novel Of The Pear" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love.&lt;ref name="Vinken 2001"&gt;Vinken (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giotto]] in his 1305 painting in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] ([[Padua]]) shows an [[Charity (virtue)|allegory of charity]] (caritas) handing her heart to [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held "upside down"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in Santa Croce, by [[Andrea Pisano]] on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by [[Andrea da Firenze]] in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Vinken 2001"/&gt;

The "scalloped" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in the miniatures in Francesco Barberino's ''Documenti d'amore ''(before 1320). A slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Brussels (MS 4459–70, fol 192v. Royal Library of Belgium). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward.&lt;ref&gt;Vinken (2001): "The change from the spherical to the scalloped form of the heart base happened more or less in train with the differing way in which the heart was held, and has dominated visual representations of the heart ever since."&lt;/ref&gt; The modern indented red heart has been used on [[playing card]]s since the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of Playing Cardes, by Charles Knutson, Renaissance Magazine 2001 {{cite web |url=http://www.renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220111738/http://renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |archivedate=2010-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various hypotheses attempted to connect the "heart shape" as it evolved in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity.&lt;ref name="mcdonell"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2159800/?GT1=9129 The Shape of My Heart: Where did the ubiquitous Valentine's symbol come from?] by Keelin McDonell, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]], Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Such theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain speculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown.  Specific suggestions include: the shape of the seed of the [[silphium]] plant, used in ancient times as an [[herbal contraceptive]],&lt;ref name="mcdonell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/sowing-the-seeds-of-love-20060212-ge1qsr.html|title=Sowing the seeds of love|first=Luke|last=Benedictus|date=12 February 2006|website=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stylized depictions of features of the human female body, such as the female's [[breasts]], [[buttocks]], [[mons pubis|pubic mound]], or spread [[vulva]].&lt;ref&gt;proposed by [[Gloria Steinem]] in the 1998 introduction to the ''[[Vagina Monologues]]'' [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/random043/97029393.htm online copy]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; "For example, the shape we call a heart—whose symmetry resembles the vulva far more than the asymmetry of the organ that shares its name—is probably a residual female genital symbol. It was reduced from power to romance by centuries of male dominance.", based on an earlier suggestion by Tanzer (1969) that the shape was used as a symbol indicating brothels in ancient Pompeii. Tanzer (1969). ''The Common People of Pompeii. A study of the graffiti. With illustrations and a map ''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance and early modern===
[[File:Empress Zoe mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumbnail|Mosaic of the Empress Zoe in the Hagia Sophia, 1239]]
Heart shapes can be seen on the [[Bible]] Jesus holds in the [[Zoë Porphyrogenita|Empress Zoë]] mosaic in the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]], but a reference to the organ was probably not intended.  It probably dates from 1239.

Likewise, heart shapes can be seen on various [[stucco]] reliefs and wall panels excavated from the ruins of [[Ctesiphon]], the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] capital (circa 90 BC – 637 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Roundel with radiating palmettes.

The [[Luther rose]] was the [[seal (device)|seal]] that was designed for [[Martin Luther]] at the behest of Prince [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick]], in 1530, while Luther was staying at the [[Coburg]] Fortress during the [[Diet of Augsburg]]. Luther wrote an explanation of the symbol to [[Lazarus Spengler]]: "a black cross in a heart, which retains its natural color, so that I myself would be reminded that faith in the Crucified saves us. 'For one who believes from the heart will be justified' ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 10:10)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/VirtualExhibits/Playing%20Cards/decks/france/index.html gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010201917/http://gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/VirtualExhibits/Playing%20Cards/decks/france/index.html |date=2006-10-10 }}, [http://i-p-c-s.org/faq/history_6.php i-p-c-s.org] {{cite web |url=http://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/p-11469.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927130238/http://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/p-11469.jpg |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }} [http://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/a-history-of-wood-engraving.htm antiquemapsandprints.com], obviously more research is needed here. {{unreliable source?|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aorta]] remains visible, as a protrusion at the top centered between the two "chambers" indicated in the symbol, in some depictions of the Sacred Heart well into the 18th century, and is partly still shown today (although mostly obscured by elements such as a crown, flames, rays, or a cross) but the "hearts" suit did not have this element since the 15th century.

The heart symbol reached Japan with the [[Nanban trade]] of 1543 to 1614, as evidenced by an [[Edo period]] [[Samurai armor|Samurai]] helmet (dated c. 1630), which includes both the rounded and indented forms of the heart symbol, representing the heart of [[Marici (Buddhism)|Marishiten]], goddess of archers.&lt;ref&gt;Samurai helmet representing the flaming jewel, by Unkai Mitsuhisa ca 1630, Ann and Gabriel Barbier-Mueller Collection, exhibited at Boston Fine Arts Museum,  April–August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
Since the 19th century, the symbol has often been used on [[Valentine's Day]] [[greeting card|cards]], [[candy]] boxes, and similar [[popular culture]] artifacts as a symbol of [[romantic love]].

The use of the heart symbol as a [[logograph]] for the English verb "to love" derives from the use in "[[I ♥ NY]]," introduced in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;"Subsequently the heart symbol became a shorthand for enthusiasm for everything form software to Yorkshire terriers. It was a stamp that validated lifestyles. People could ♥ their grandchildren or line dancing or Buddha." Stephen Amidon, Thomas Amidon, ''The Sublime Engine: A Biography of the Human Heart'' (2011), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heart symbols were used to symbolize [[Health (gaming)|"health" or "lives"]] in [[video game]]s; influentially so in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986). ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (1987, 1988) had a "life bar" composed of [[hexagon]]s, but in 1990s remakes of these games, the hexagons were replaced by heart shapes. Since the 1990s, the heart symbol has also been used as an ideogram indicating health outside of the video gaming context, e.g. its use by restaurants to indicate heart-healthy nutrient content claim (e.g. "low in [[cholesterol]]"). A copyrighted "heart-check" symbol to indicate heart-healthy food was introduced by the [[American Heart Association]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;"the heart-check mark that began to appear on a wide array of food packaging in 1995. The symbol consists of a heart branded with a bold, efficient check mark. It is copyrighted by the American Heart Association (AHA) which licences it for a nominal fee to companies whose products meet the organization's criteria for saturated fat and cholesterol content." Stephen Amidon, Thomas Amidon, ''The Sublime Engine: A Biography of the Human Heart'' (2011), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraldry==
{{Hatnote|"Heart field" or "heart shield" are terms for an [[inescutcheon]] placed ''en surtout''.}}
[[File:COA family de Fürsten von Lüneburg.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of the [[Principality of Lüneburg]], originating with [[William of Winchester, Lord of Lüneburg]] (d. 1213) who married [[Helena of Denmark|Helena]], daughter of [[Valdemar I of Denmark]], and therefore adopted the "Danish tincture" to the arms of his father, [[Henry the Lion]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Weyers in: Stengel (ed.), ''Archiv für Diplomatik: Schriftgeschichte, Siegel, und Wappenkunde'', Volume 54, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jNPEDfce9fgC&amp;pg=PA100 p. 100].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The earliest heart-shaped charges in heraldry appear in the 12th century; the hearts in the [[coat of arms of Denmark]] go back to the royal banner of the kings of Denmark, in turn based on a seal used as early as the 1190s. However, while the charges are clearly heart-shaped, they did not in origin depict hearts, or symbolize any idea related to love. Instead they are assumed to have depicted the leaves of the [[Nuphar|water-lily]]. Early heraldic heart-shaped charges depicting the leaves of water-lilies are found in various other designs related to territories close to rivers or a coastline (''e.g.'' [[Flags of Frisia]]).

Inverted heart symbols have been used in heraldry as stylized [[testicle]]s (''coglioni'' in Italian) as in the [[canting arms]] of the [[Colleoni]] family of Milan.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, John and George Burnett (1969). ''Woodward's a treatise on heraldry, British and foreign'', [https://archive.org/stream/treatiseonherald00wooduoft#page/202/mode/2up page 203]. Originally published 1892, Edinburgh: W. &amp; A. B. Johnson. {{ISBN|0-7153-4464-1}}. {{LCCN|02020303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seal attributed to [[William IV, Lord of Douglas|William, Lord of Douglas]] (of 1333) shows a heart shape, identified as the heart of [[Robert the Bruce]]. The authenticity of this seal is "very questionable",&lt;ref&gt;McAndrew, ''Scotland's Historic Heraldry'', 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QFkI3G31HTMC&amp;pg=PA141 p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. it could possibly date to the late 14th or even the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;McAndrew 2006, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldic charges actually representing hearts became more common in the [[early modern period]], with the [[Sacred Heart]] depicted in [[ecclesiastical heraldry]], and hearts representing love appearing in bourgeois coats of arms. Hearts also later became popular elements in municipal coats of arms.

==Botanical symbolism==
{{Main|Silphium}}
There has been some conjecture regarding the link between the traditional heart symbol and images of the fruit of Silphium, a (probably) extinct plant known to [[classical antiquity]] and belonging to the genus [[Ferula]], used as a condiment and medicine, (the medicinal properties including [[contraceptive]] and [[abortifacient]] activity, linking the plant to sexuality and love).&lt;ref&gt;Favorito, E. N.; Baty, K. (February 1995). "The Silphium Connection". Celator. 9 (2): 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver coins from the ancient Libya of the 6th - 5th BC bear images strongly reminiscent of the heart symbol, sometimes accompanied by images of the Silphium plant.&lt;ref&gt;T. V. Buttrey, "The Coins and the Cult", Expedition magazine vol. 34, Nos. 1–2 "Special Issue: Gifts to the Goddesses—Cyrene's Sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone", Spring–Summer 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koerper |first1=H. |last2=Kolls |first2=A.

In [[Code page 437]], the original character set of the IBM PC, the value of 3 (hexadecimal 03) represents the heart symbol. This value is shared with the non-printing [[End-of-text character|ETX]] control character, which overrides the glyph in many contexts.

The Unicode character of the letter ''ghan'' of the [[Georgian alphabet]] ([[wikt:ღ|ღ]]) has seen some use as a surrogate heart symbol in online communication.{{according to whom|date=November 2013}}{{year needed|date=November 2013}}

==Parametrisation==
A number of [[parametrisation]]s of approximately heart-shaped [[mathematical curve|curves]] have been described.
The best-known of these is the [[cardioid]], which is an [[epicycloid]] with one [[Cusp (singularity)|cusp]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric W. Weisstein|Weisstein, Eric W.]], "[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cardioid.html Cardioid]" from [[MathWorld]].&lt;/ref&gt; though as the cardioid lacks the point, it may be seen as a stylized water-lily leaf, a so-called [[seeblatt]], rather than a heart. Other curves, such as the [[Level set|implicit curve]] (x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−1)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;−x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;y&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=0, may produce better approximations of the heart shape.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric W. Weisstein]], [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html "Heart Curve."] From [[MathWorld]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its membership include [[dance]]rs, musicians, [[Disc jockey|DJs]], [[drag queen]]s, [[Performance art|performing artists]], [[Visual arts|visual artists]], [[Singing|singers]], [[songwriter]]s, [[Record producer|music producers]] and engineers.&lt;ref name="mother juan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ericka"&gt;[[Huffington Post]]: ''"After Dark: Erickatoure Aviance, Artist And Nightlife Personality"'' by James Michael Nichols (August /24, 2014, updated February 02, 2016) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/24/erickatoure-aviance-after_n_5703627.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The Legendary House of Aviance is especially known for its voguers, performances, [[Runway (fashion)|runways]], [[fashion]],&lt;ref name="ericka" /&gt; music, music producers and DJs.&lt;ref name="nita" /&gt; Its membership as of 2014 is just over 700 worldwide.&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt;  Most of its members are or have been part of nightlife in one way or another.&lt;ref name="ericka" /&gt; The House has for a long time stopped competing (''walking''&lt;ref&gt;Susman, Tara ([[Columbia University]]), ''"The Vogue of Life: Fashion Culture, Identity, and the Dance of Survival in the Gay BalIs"'', disClosure: A Journal of Social Theory, p. 118 (PDF p.3 ) [in] UKnowledge [http://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1220&amp;context=disclosure]&lt;/ref&gt;) in the ball scene, and as such, "is not exactly like the voguing houses of [[Jennie Livingston]]'s film [[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris Is Burning]], since it does not compete. The House of Aviance is something of a [[queer]] kinship network in which members serve as extended, pretended, and—some would argue—improved family that supports and enables its members."&lt;ref name="on point" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, José Esteban, ''"Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity"'', NYU Press (2009), p. 75, {{ISBN|9780814757284}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f1MTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The House of Aviance was founded in August 1989 by [[Mother Juan Aviance]].&lt;ref name="mother juan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="on point" /&gt; The House began in [[Washington, D.C.]] on 1420 Harvard Street before it was moved in 1993 to [[New York City]] by Mother Juan.&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt; Since its move, New York has become its base, but it still plays an active role in New York and Washington DC's nightlife as well as other cities in the U.S. Since its inception, it has become one of the major Houses in New York's [[ball culture|ballroom]] and [[vogue (dance)|voguing]] scene having won many trophies and cash prizes for their performances in ball competitions before the House ultimately stopped ''walking balls'' altogether.&lt;ref name="nita"&gt;Thump : ''"We Asked Two Quintessential NYC Queer DJs About the Art of the All-Night Set"'' by Steve Weinstein (November 20, 2015) [https://thump.vice.com/en_ca/article/we-asked-two-quintessential-nyc-queer-djs-about-the-art-of-the-all-night-set]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="on point" /&gt;

Previously, The House of Aviance was called ''The House of Power''. That remained the name for few weeks during its inception until Mother Juan decided to change it to ''The House of Aviance''. According to Mother Juan, he was glancing at a vendor's cart on the streets of DC. The vendor was selling [[perfume]]s. As Mother Juan glanced at the cart, he remembered a [[Television advertisement|commercial]] from his childhood days by [[Prince Matchabelli]]. That commercial contained a [[Melody|tune]] with the [[lyrics]]: ''"We're going to have an Aviance Night."''  In an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], Mother Juan decided to rename the House to ''The House of Aviance''. Since then, the name of the House's has remained the same.&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt;

To commemorate their second anniversary, The House of Aviance threw its first ball on Sunday, August 11, 1991 titled  ''"The Inferno Ball at Tracks DC"''. Most of the notable New York and DC houses walked that night, including Aviance members. Some of the judges that night included the ''icons'' [[Dorian Corey]] and [[Pepper LaBeija]], both featured in the acclaimed [[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris Is Burning]] film a year earlier.&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The flyer of The House of Aviance first ball can be seen in Mother Juan Aviance's Facebook page [https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150284368849430&amp;set=a.69627699429.68369.686409429&amp;type=1&amp;theater]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding, Mother Juan Aviance has remained the ''"House Mother"'', and Daddy Tony Aviance the ''"House Father"''.&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ericka" /&gt; As of 2017, they are two of the longest serving and continuously active ''house parents'' in [[ball culture#Houses|ballroom house]] history. The House of Aviance's first DJ was [[Jean-Philippe Aviance]] who went on to produce  ''Go Bitch Go! – "Work This Pussy"'' (Original Bitch Mix) in 1991, ''Useless, Give Me Luv – Alcatraz'' and several other tracks.&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt;

==Influences==
===Voguing===
The Aviance style of voguing is referred to as "Aviance Storytelling". It is based on graceful, sharp and elegant lines with great fluidity and a high degree of experimentation and individuality.&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="john"&gt;John Aviance bio [in] The House of Aviance official website [http://houseofaviance.com/2013/10/03/john-aviance/]&lt;/ref&gt; Fluidity is key in Aviance Storytelling. The style is [[narrative]] in structure and form, punctuated by an "A" or heart-like [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] in certain phrases symbolizing the name of the House or the House's [[logo]] (''The Sacred Heart of Aviance'').

===Music===
The House of Aviance through its multi-genre record label ([[Aviance Records, LLC]]) has over the years produced [[House music|house tracks]] like ''Avi'ously Aviance'' produced by David Ohana Aviance and featuring [[EJ Aviance]], [[Kevin Aviance]], Perry Aviance and Mother Juan Aviance; ''OVAH'' by [[Erickatoure Aviance]]; ''I Am Art'' by EJ Aviance; and the [[soul music|soulful track]] ''They Don't See'' — a collaboration between producer/remixer Call Me Cleve (Cleveland Allen) and vocalist Zhana Roiya.&lt;ref name="EV AVI"&gt;''"Untucked- 'I Am Art' EJ Aviance"'' [in] David Atlanta (March 11, 2013)[http://davidatlanta.com/2013/03/untucked-i-art-ej-aviance/]&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most highly acclaimed musicians to have emerged from The House of Aviance is Kevin Aviance with House anthems like ''Alive'', ''Cunty (The Feeling)'', ''Gimme More (Aviance)'', and ''Din Da Da''.&lt;ref&gt;''"Venus, Volume 6, Issue 5"'', Venus Magazine (2000), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The House of Aviance's first DJ [[Jean-Philippe Aviance]]'s 1991 track ''Go Bitch Go! – "Work This Pussy"'' (Original Bitch Mix) has been covered and released numerous times by some highly acclaimed DJs such as [[Armand Van Helden]] in his 2014 ''Masterpiece''.&lt;ref&gt;Music Times : ''"Armand Van Helden's 'Masterpeice' To Be Released Feb. 15 On Ministry of Sound"'' by Ryan Middleton (December 24, 2014) [http://www.musictimes.com/articles/21679/20141224/armand-van-helden-masterpeice-released-feb-15-ministry-of-sound-tracklist.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Britney Spears]]'  2013 track ''[[Work Bitch]]'' from her ''[[Britney Jean]]'' album is reported by [[music critics|critics]] like Barry Walters as a recreation of ''"the [[vogue (dance)|vogueing]] vibe of gay/trans bitch tracks like Go Bitch Go's "(Work This) Pussy"'' [Go Bitch Go! – "Work This Pussy"] originally produced by Jean-Philippe Aviance in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;''"Britney Spears Goes Blanker Than Usual on the Nightmarish 'Britney Jean'"''  by Barry Walters (December 3, 2013) [in] Spin [http://www.spin.com/2013/12/britney-spears-britney-jean-worst-new-music/]&lt;/ref&gt; According to critic Christina Lee, Britney's ''Work Bitch'' track sounds more like [[RuPaul]]'s 1993 track ''[[Supermodel of the World|Supermodel (You Better Work)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''"Britney Spears' "Work Bitch" Hits The Web Early: Listen To The Club Banger That Works (Bitch)'"'' by Christina Lee (September 15, 2013) [in] IDOLATOR [http://www.idolator.com/7484328/britney-spears-work-bitch]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, DJs [[Chris Cox (DJ)|Chris Cox]] and Yiannis Mistress remixed [[Chris Cox (DJ)#2009|Jean-Phillippe Aviance's ''"Giv Me Luv"'' track starring Dihann Moore]].&lt;ref name="discogs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/DJ-Yiannis-Reloaded/release/2260359|publisher=discogs.com|title=DJ Yiannis* - Reloaded (CD) at Discogs |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beat Box - Dance /Electronic : ''"Success Of DJ Collections Will Reflect State Of Industry"'' by Michael Paoletta [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mA0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; DJ/Producer David Ohana is a member of the House as well as business partner in Aviance Records.&lt;ref&gt;Biography of David Ohana Aviance [in] Aviance Records official website [http://aviancerecords.com/bio/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coined phrases===
The House of Aviance is also known in the ballroom scene for their coined phrases which in essence describes their "look" (the Aviance look) in reference to their sense of fashion, their voguing style and performance. Some of these coined phrases include:

*''"Avi'ously Aviance"'' : This is in reference to their sense of fashion - big, glamorous and flamboyant. The debut track released by Aviance Records is titled ''Avi'ously Aviance''.&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avi record"&gt;''Avi'ously Aviance'' by David Ohana Aviance, feat. EJ Aviance, Kevin Aviance, Perry Aviance &amp; Mother Juan Aviance (2014) on Itunes [https://itunes.apple.com/bw/album/aviously-aviance-feat.-ej/id950691794]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''"Aviance Storytelling"'' : This is in reference to their voguing style - elegant, graceful, sharp, fluid, [[narrative]] in structure and form, and punctuated by an "A" or [[heart]]-like shaped [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] in certain phrases, symbolizing ''Aviance'' or their House logo (''"The Sacred Heart of Aviance"'').&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="john" /&gt;
*''"Work. Fierce. Over. Aviance!"'' : This is the coined phrase and trademark of The House of Aviance's oldest daughter [[Kevin Aviance]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Aviance [in] ''"Famous Gay African-American Men"'' [in] We Are Members [http://www.wearemembersofthiscommunity.org/famous-gay-african-american-men.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It is in reference to their [[Runway (fashion)|runway]].

==Why the House doesn't walk balls anymore==
{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=My concern for the kids/members of the House far overshadows my desire for Ballroom fame

...

Some of the kids are fragile and want and need to be accepted and/or belong, but if they make one wrong move on the runway they are verbally abused and humiliated in front of their peers.  In my opinion, I think people should be treated with more dignity and respect than what I've witnessed in the Ballroom.  But make no mistakes I love the concept and despite all the things I find objectionable about the Ballroom I do remember where I came from.|salign=right |source=—[[Mother Juan Aviance]]"&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt;}}

Despite winning numerous trophies and cash prizes for their performances in ballroom competitions over the years, the House suddenly stopped walking. According to Mother Juan, he decided to stop his House kids from walking balls because of "Ballroom politics", unfair judging and the negative atmosphere of the ballroom, such as verbal abuse, intimidation and humiliation especially where kids "make one wrong move on the runway."&lt;ref name="Juan" /&gt;

==Current role==
The House is still an active "working house" with over 700 members [[world]]wide and regularly hold events/performances.&lt;ref name="on point" /&gt; Members still work or perform in their respective fields with support and guidance from house parents - Mother Juan and Daddy Tony as well as other family members. The House's oldest daughter — [[Kevin Aviance]] made special appearances in [[Wolfgang Busch]]'s 2006 documentary ''[[How Do I Look]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Porter. Darwin ; Prince, Danforth , ''"Blood Moon's guide to gay and lesbian film"'', Blood Moon Productions, Limited (2007), p. 247.{{ISBN|9780974811871}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Documentary film|documentary]] was a chronicle of the [[ball culture]] in [[Harlem]]. With the [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] epidemic affecting the ballroom scene for decades, The House of Aviance is no exception, and the House and its membership has for years taken active roles in HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention as well as throwing charity events to support organisations like the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis|GMHC]].&lt;ref&gt;"ON APRIL 10th - YOUTH HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY w/ DJ BOLO AVIANCE and MORE!"

Thus actual rules were invented for Icehouse by Andrew Looney, Kristin Wunderlich (then future wife of Looney) and John Cooper, then plastic pyramid pieces were made to play the game.&lt;ref name=wt/&gt;&lt;ref name=gms/&gt; The first commercially available set were solid non-stackable pyramids released in 1989 with only 100 sets made.&lt;ref name=gms/&gt; The pieces were made from resin in his apartment, which upset the landlord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=C.

Additional games beyond Icehouse were created including [[Martian chess|Martian Chess]], [[Zendo (game)|Zendo]], and Homeworlds.&lt;ref name=wr/&gt; Looney then created the [[IceTowers]] game which used stacking pyramids leading to a change in the pyramid pieces' specification for stacking. The four games were released as a part of Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set, which was the first Icehouse pyramid system release by Looney Labs.&lt;ref name=gms/&gt; In 2001, Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Abstract Board Game of 2000''.&lt;ref name=pyd&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=Micah|title=Origins Awards Announced: Pyramid Wins Best Magazine|url=http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/origins2000.html|accessdate=June 8, 2015|work=Pyramid Magazine|publisher=Steve Jackson Games|date=July 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icehouse was recognized as a game system in the game design textbook ''Rules of Play'' by Katue Salen and Eric Zimmerman.&lt;ref name=gms/&gt;

By June 21, 2002, Icehouse pieces were being sold in tubes containing a stash, or 15 pyramids of a single color, with nine colors available. Labs then released the book ''Playing With Pyramids'', which contained a dozen games by the Looneys, Cooper, Kory Heath and Jacob Davenport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=June 21, 2002 |title=Playing with Pyramids: 12 Games for Icehouse Pieces |url=http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=2852  |magazine=Pyramid |department=Pyramid Pick |series= |language= |edition= |location= |publisher=Steve Jackson Games |publication-date= |volume=2 |issue= |access-date=May 25, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Zendo boxed set won ''Best Abstract Board Game of 2003'',&lt;ref name=icv1&gt;{{cite news|title=Origins Award Winners for 2003|url=http://icv2.com/articles/games/view/5173/origins-award-winners-for-2003|accessdate=June 8, 2015|work=ICv2|date=June 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the set won the Mensa Select Game Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Arneson |first1=Erik |title=Mensa Select Award Winners |url=http://boardgames.about.com/od/awards/a/mensa_select.htm |website=About |accessdate=June 24, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626134309/http://boardgames.about.com/od/awards/a/mensa_select.htm |archivedate=June 26, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in 2007, [[Treehouse (game)|Treehouse]] won the Origins Award for ''Best Board Game of 2006''.&lt;ref name=icv2&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Origins Award Winners|url=http://icv2.com/articles/games/view/10881/2007-origins-award-winners|accessdate=June 8, 2015|work=ICv2|date=July 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looney Labs relaunched the Icehouse pieces as "Looney Pyramids" with new packaging with its IceDice set in June 2011&lt;ref name=icv&gt;{{cite news|last1=Niebling|first1=William|title=Review of 'IceDice'|url=http://icv2.com/articles/games/view/19745/review-icedice|accessdate=June 10, 2015|work=ICv2|date=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Pink Hijinks in December 2012.&lt;ref name=icv0&gt;{{cite news|last1=Niebling|first1=William|title=Review: 'Looney Pyramids'--'Treehouse' AND 'Pink Hijinks'|url=http://icv2.com/articles/games/view/24620/review-looney-pyramids-treehouse-pink-hijinks|accessdate=June 10, 2015|work=ICv2|date=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, the IcehouseGames.org website listed 400 games playable with icehouse pyramids.&lt;ref name=wr/&gt;

Original prototype under the name of ''Pyramid Throwdown'' in 2015, ''Pyramid Arcade'' was launched as a [[Kickstarter]] campaign on April 5, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kickstarter Tabletop Alert: 'Pyramid Arcade'|url=https://geekdad.com/2016/04/pyramid-arcade/|accessdate=May 25, 2017|work=GeekDad|date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new boxed pyramid set was funded in under 12 hours.

== Description ==
[[File:Icehouse pieces paper and plastic.jpg|Icehouse pieces in paper and plastic|thumb]]
The pieces are four-sided pyramids that can nest and stack with [[pip (counting)|pip]]ping from 1 to 3 at the base.  A group of three pyramids, one of each size, is called a "trio." Each "stash" or set of Icehouse pieces consists of five trios, or fifteen pyramids (variously called pieces, pyramids, or minions) of the same color and five of each three sizes:&lt;ref name=gms/&gt; five large 3-point pyramids (called "queens" in some games), five medium 2-point pyramids (sometimes called "drones"), and five small 1-point pyramids (or "pawns").{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The stacked and nested feature is not used in the original Icehouse game, but is taken advantage of in some of the other Icehouse-based games listed below.&lt;ref name=gms/&gt;

Icehouse pieces were, for many years, sold as tubes containing one stash of durable crystal-look plastic pieces&lt;ref name=wr/&gt; in one of ten available colors (though cyan was only available through their promotional program or as part of the Ice Towers set).  There was also a less expensive starter set called Origami Icehouse (later called Paper Icehouse), made of cardstock in four colors, which one punched out and folded into the pyramid shapes. In 2006, [[Looney Labs]] began selling Icehouse pieces as ''Treehouse sets'', which are multicolored sets of 15 pyramids: five colors, each color having one each of the three sizes.  Looney Labs has also sold boxed sets for [[Zendo (game)|Zendo]] and [[IceTowers]]; the latter contained cyan pieces.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The Icehouse website also has instructions for making your own pieces. Looney Labs has licensed [[Crystal Caste]] to make regulation-sized Icehouse pieces out of semiprecious [[gemstone|stone]].&lt;ref name=wr/&gt; Beginning with its Looney Pyramids relaunch set, IceDice, the sets are packaged in pyramid shaped nylon zipper bag.&lt;ref name=icv/&gt;

== Score-keeping ==
Icehouse pieces can also be used as a score-keeping device or [[counter (collectible card games)|counter]] for non-icehouse games. For example, when scoring a [[Cosmic Wimpout]] game, a small pyramid would be worth five points, a medium pyramid worth twenty-five points, and a large pyramid one-hundred; the goal being to collect five of the large pieces (for the 500 point standard game).  They could be use instead of [[poker chip]]s, the denominations would be determined by size rather than color (smalls are worth one, mediums worth five, and larges valued at twenty-five, for example).

This isn’t reality TV. There’s no judges or voting off. There’s not a pot of money sitting at the end ... the goal is to get a job that will allow us to get out of the house and to move on to a bigger career. This is just the first step.

The {{Nihongo|'''Japan FM League'''|ジャパン エフエム リーグ}} (JFL) is a commercial [[radio network]] in Japan. It is owned by [[J-Wave]] and established in October 1993.

JFL's main ideal is to respect the operation of each of its affiliates, letting each affiliate flourish under its own terms. The network is a [[co-operative]], with each affiliate offering its resources when useful. So for example when J-Wave wants to air a concert or ask for interviews when a group tours in Nagoya, it can easily borrow the studios of [[Zip FM (Aichi)|ZIP-FM]] (the JFL affiliate there) to help produce what's needed.

'''''Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular''''' is a [[List of Thanksgiving television specials|Thanksgiving television special]] with American singer [[Lady Gaga]] and [[the Muppets]]. The 90-minute program aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on November 28, 2013, with guest stars [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Elton John]] and [[RuPaul]] and an appearance by [[Kristen Bell]]. It was the second Gaga Thanksgiving special on ABC, after ''[[A Very Gaga Thanksgiving]]'' in 2011. The singer had previously collaborated with the Muppets on media appearances and in her shows.

The special featured songs from Gaga's third [[studio album]], ''[[Artpop]]'', and duets with the guest stars. Critics gave the special mixed reviews, with some praising Gaga for being relatable in the show. Other reviewers were disappointed with its lack of production ideas, other than as a promotion for ''Artpop''. It had lower [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] than other Thanksgiving specials, with a total of 3.62 million viewers and a 0.9 rating in the adult age 18–49 demographic.

==Synopsis==
Announcer [[Tom Kane]] explains to [[Pepe the King Prawn]] that the special is being filmed for [[Lady Gaga]], the latter then appears and  explains why she invited the Muppets and then performs "[[Venus (Lady Gaga song)|Venus]]". After [[Statler and Waldorf]]'s review of the performance, [[Kristen Bell]] asks for Gaga's autograph. This annoys [[Miss Piggy]] who was planning her own finale and enlists the Muppets to hold auditions. Gaga performs "[[Applause (Lady Gaga song)|Applause]]", followed by "[[Bennie and the Jets]]" and "[[Artpop (song)|Artpop]]" with [[Elton John]] (with the Muppets joining them for the latter). After discussing ideas for the finale, Gaga performs "Manicure" and the Muppets talk about the most inappropriate gifts they ever received. [[Kermit the Frog]] joins Gaga in a duet of "[[Gypsy (Lady Gaga song)|Gypsy]]", and [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] duets on "[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]". Kermit's friendship with Gaga angers Miss Piggy; after a performance of "Fashion!" by Gaga and [[RuPaul]], Miss Piggy bemoans the attention paid to the singer. Although she dreams of singing "[[Santa Baby]]", she is upstaged in her dream by [[Youthful Praise]]. After a trailer for the upcoming ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'', Gaga asks Miss Piggy to suggest a finale and reprises "Applause" with the Muppets.

In October 2013, the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) announced a 90-minute special entitled ''Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular''. It was the second [[List of Thanksgiving television specials|Thanksgiving television special]] on ABC by Gaga, after ''[[A Very Gaga Thanksgiving]]'' in 2011. The singer collaborated with the Muppets for the special, which aired on November 28, 2013. "I was so excited when ABC called me about doing a holiday special this year. I knew it just wouldn't be a complete night of laughter and memories without the Muppets! Can't wait to see the gang again, and I hope Miss Piggy's still not mad about Kermit ... We're just friends," Gaga said about the special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/lady-gaga-teams-muppets-adorable-photos-result/story?id=20603044|title=Lady Gaga Teams Up With the Muppets and Adorable Photos Result|last=Messer|first=Lesley|date=October 17, 2013|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]]|accessdate=December 14, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318120644/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/lady-gaga-teams-muppets-adorable-photos-result/story?id=20603044|archivedate=March 18, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guest stars included [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Elton John]] and [[RuPaul]], with an appearance by [[Kristen Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/10/17/lady-gaga-muppets-holiday-spectacular|title=Lady Gaga teams up with her littlest monsters, the Muppets, for another holiday spectacular|first=Jodi|last=Walker|accessdate=November 15, 2013|date=October 17, 2013|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga performed several songs from her third studio album, ''[[Artpop]]''.&lt;ref name="rscelebrate"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-to-celebrate-thanksgiving-with-the-muppets-20131018|title=Lady Gaga to Celebrate Thanksgiving With the Muppets|accessdate=November 15, 2013|date=October 18, 2013|first=Kory|last=Grow|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028043301/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-to-celebrate-thanksgiving-with-the-muppets-20131018|archivedate=October 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer had collaborated twice with the Muppets in the past; in 2009 Kermit the Frog was her date at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], and she featured [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] pieces on [[the Monster Ball Tour]] (2009–2011).&lt;ref name=Marechal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marechal|first=AJ|title=ABC Sets Holiday Special with Lady Gaga and the Muppets|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/abc-sets-holiday-special-with-lady-gaga-and-the-muppets-1200735249/|accessdate=October 17, 2013|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 17, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017223449/http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/abc-sets-holiday-special-with-lady-gaga-and-the-muppets-1200735249/|archivedate=October 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special was described in press releases as "an avant-garde twist on the classic holiday variety show as Lady Gaga goes backstage with the Muppets, making a performance dream come true for the multi-platinum singer-songwriter when they combine forces to sing holiday favorites and Lady Gaga hits".&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; It was confirmed that holiday classics like "[[Deck the Halls]]" and "[[Jingle Bells]]" would be performed by the Muppets, as well as songs from ''Artpop''.

===Critical response===
According to Marissa G. Muller of ''Rolling Stone'', Gaga "was at her most accessible during the show, sharing the difficulties of life on the road and her love of the holidays – specifically, how she grew up watching the Muppets and has had a long love for Kermit. The whole affair was relatively conservative for Gaga and weirdly progressive for the Muppets".&lt;ref name="rsreview"/&gt; Muller wrote that the special was aired at an opportune moment for Gaga, since ''Artpop''{{'s}} sales had dropped 82 percent in its second week and the show was hoped to woo back her audience. She called the opening performance of "Venus" one of its top moments.&lt;ref name="rsreview"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/five-memorable-moments-from-lady-gagas-muppets-holiday-spectacular-20131129|title=Five Memorable Moments From Lady Gaga's Muppets 'Holiday Spectacular'|accessdate=December 14, 2016|date=November 29, 2013|first=Marissa G.|last=Muller|work=Rolling Stone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924191323/http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/five-memorable-moments-from-lady-gagas-muppets-holiday-spectacular-20131129|archivedate=September 24, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Graham wrote for [[VH1]] that Gaga had a lack of relatability at that point in her career: "To her credit, [she] seems to have recognized this flaw in her brand strategy and has been working overtime of late to humanize herself ... [Anyone] who watches the cable premiere of ''Lady Gaga &amp; The Muppets Holiday Spectacular'' ... will definitely gain a new appreciation for [her]".&lt;ref name="vh1review"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/52092/lady-gaga-muppets/|title=Five Memorable Moments From Lady Gaga &amp; The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular|accessdate=December 14, 2016|date=November 29, 2013|first=Mark|last=Graham|publisher=[[VH1]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220200321/http://www.vh1.com/news/52092/lady-gaga-muppets/|archivedate=December 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maricela Gonzalez of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called ''Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular'' a "cross-promotional commercial", enabling Gaga to promote ''Artpop'' and enhancing the Muppets' popularity. Gonzalez described it as "equal parts warm, fuzzy, cynical, and depressed by consumerism overtaking the so-called 'holiday spirit'. But why fret? It’s Lady Gaga and the Muppets!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/11/29/lady-gaga-muppets-holiday-spectacular-react|title='Lady Gaga &amp; the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular' react: Cross-promotional cheer for one and all|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Marcela|last=Gonzalez|date=November 29, 2013|accessdate=November 29, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221104150/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/29/entertainment/la-et-ms-lady-gaga-and-the-muppets-created-a-holiday-tease-20131129|archivedate=December 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myles McNutt of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the special a grade of C, criticizing it as a mere promotional vehicle for Gaga with the Muppets feeling like a last-minute addition. The production was unable to balance Gaga's album promotion with a Muppets holiday special: "Nothing in ''Lady Gaga &amp; The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular'' destroys the sanctity of the Muppets ... However, the potential for a Muppets holiday special was never given room to materialize amidst a Lady Gaga concert special designed to sell her new album. The choice to combine the two may have reached out to a broader audience, but the incongruence of the special's various parts&amp;nbsp;... was bound to frustrate a sizable portion of that audience."&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/lady-gaga-and-the-muppets-holiday-spectacular-106088|title=Lady Gaga And The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular|accessdate=December 14, 2016|date=November 29, 2013|first=Myles|last=McNutt|work=[[The A.V.

Rather than aim for holiday timelessness, this was self-promotion, with the Muppets often coming to Gaga's world than the other way around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/29/entertainment/la-et-ms-lady-gaga-and-the-muppets-created-a-holiday-tease-20131129|title=Lady Gaga and the Muppets create a holiday tease|last=Martens|first=Todd|date=November 29, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221104150/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/29/entertainment/la-et-ms-lady-gaga-and-the-muppets-created-a-holiday-tease-20131129|archivedate=December 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Chris Willman also gave it a negative review, citing the show's palpably-low budget and its dialogue, guest appearances, Gaga's lip-syncing and production: "If the 90 seemingly endless minutes of ''Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular'' had a predecessor, it might be the long-suppressed ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special|Star Wars Christmas Special]]'', though nothing here was so outrageously wrong (or right) that people will still be bootlegging this one in 35 years’ time. At least there was a familiar 'why is this happening?' question hovering over the star-crossed proceedings, albeit without the benefit of any guest stars as seriously wacky as that one's to show up and redeem the incongruousness.

[[File:Poster - Gone With the Wind 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|&lt;!--Please do not wikilink captions; these terms are already linked in the article--&gt;''Gone with the Wind'' has generated the most admissions at cinemas in the United Kingdom|alt=The theatrical poster for Gone with the Wind.]]

This list charts the most successful films at [[Movie theater|cinemas]] in the United Kingdom by [[box office]] sales, in [[pounds sterling]] and admissions. An overview of the top-earning films and record-holders is provided, as well as the highest-grossing British productions, the most successful non-English language films and the sound films that have generated the most admissions. A summary of the most popular films over the course of the last century is also included.

American productions dominate, with all films earning over £50 million at the box office either completely or partly produced by [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] studios. [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British film]] is well represented, with about half the films on the list qualifying as British productions; however, due to the &lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT "CORRECT". THIS LIST IS WRITTEN IN BRITISH ENGLISH--&gt;globalization&lt;!--"GLOBALIZATION" IS THE PREDOMINANT SPELLING ACCORDING TO THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY--&gt; of the film industry most successful British productions since the start of the [[twenty-first century]] have been co-produced with other countries. While there is no universally accepted definition of a film's nationality, a legal definition for the Britishness of a film has existed in English law since 2007, and this is the criteria used here. For films made prior to 2007, the nationalities listed by the sources supplying the data are used where they are given.

The 2015 ''[[Star Wars]]'' film, ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'', is the highest-grossing film in terms of [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] box-office sales. The effects of [[inflation]] are a significant contributing factor to recent films surpassing the box-office records of older films, so when considering the number of admissions ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1940) is the most successful film, although this was achieved over several release cycles prior to the [[home video]] era.

==Highest-grossing films by box-office revenue==

===Top earning films===
The highest earners at the box-office are mostly American films and UK-US co-productions. [[Film series]] dominate—accounting for twenty-eight of the thirty-three films that have earned in excess of £50 million—including six films in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'']] franchise, [[Peter Jackson]]'s first four [[Middle earth in film#Peter Jackson film series|Tolkien adaptations]], the four [[James Bond filmography#Daniel Craig: 2005–present|Daniel Craig ''James Bond'' films]] and four ''[[Star Wars]]'' instalments. Twenty entries are British co-productions and a further four are based on stories and characters created by British writers. This table only charts films released since 1989, but due to [[inflation]] it is unlikely anything released prior to then will surpass the films on the list in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] terms.&lt;ref name="BFI 2017a" /&gt;

===Record-holders===
Since 1975, twelve films may have set the record as the "highest-grossing" film. Regular tracking of box-office performance only started in 1975, so it is only possible to chart the transition of the record with any serious degree of accuracy within this period. Prior to then, ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' is accepted to be the record-holder, assuming the record from another musical, ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'', in 1966 and going on to treble the earnings of that film.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Sheldon |chapter=The Sound of Music |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=19mmZIqaqhgC&amp;pg=PA26 26]–28|editor-last1=Williams |editor-first1=Linda Ruth |editor-last2=Hammond |editor-first2=Michael |title=Contemporary American Cinema |year=2006 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=9780335218318 |quote=In Britain it opened in March 1965 and remained in continuous circulation until 1969. By December 1965, when it had been shown in only seventeen pre-release engagements in London and key cities, it had grossed £1,925,869 from 6,926,825 admissions [''Kine. Weekly'', 16 December 1965: 151]. A year later it had broken ''South Pacific'''s record of £2,300,000, which had been amassed over seven years of release, for the highest gross received by any film shown in Britain, with an estimated 21 million admissions to date ... As a result, it was named by ''Kine.

===British productions===
Since 2007, under English law, films can qualify as British via a cultural test, through an official bilateral co-production agreement or under the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production. The cultural test utilises a points based system which takes account of cultural content, creative elements and heritage, the nationality of the cast and crew and where the bulk of the production takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The cultural test for film |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/supporting-uk-film/british-certification-tax-relief/cultural-test-film#films-certified |accessdate=19 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215234435/http://www.bfi.org.uk/supporting-uk-film/british-certification-tax-relief/cultural-test-film#films-certified#films-certified |archive-date=15 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of this process can draw to counter-intuitive conclusions; films not classified as British under this system may have British elements, such as being based on books by British authors and featuring British actors—as was the case with ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' trilogy—while films that are regarded as quintessentially American—such as ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' or ''The Dark Knight''—can result in being classified as British.

The most successful British productions in the modern marketplace generally have American investment, with ''The King's Speech'' and ''The Inbetweeners Movie'' the only fully British films to have earned in excess of £40 million. Film series still dominate, accounting for twenty-seven of the top thirty-four films. The remaining films mostly are adaptations of popular novels, stage musicals and television series and biographical films based on historical events. ''The King's Speech'' replaces ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' as the most successful British production if the criteria is restricted to solely British-produced films.

===Non-English language films===
Chinese and Spanish films have achieved the most success at the box-office in the twenty-first century, with three entries apiece among the top ten non-[[English language]] performers. ''The Passion of the Christ'', directed by [[Mel Gibson]], is the top performer and Gibson also has another entry in fourth place with ''Apocalypto''; both films feature [[dead language]]s.

==Highest-grossing films by box-office admissions==
Up to and including 2003, the [[British Film Institute]] (BFI) estimate fifty-two sound films have generated over 10 million admissions. The [[European Audiovisual Observatory]] (LUMIERE) have been tracking UK admissions since 1996, and they estimate that twenty-two films have generated over 10 million admissions in that period. Due to conflicting estimates, both sets of figures are presented together here in chronological order. While the two datasets are generally consistent with each other, the estimates from LUMIERE are on average slightly lower than those from the BFI, leading to ''Bridget Jones's Diary'' being included in the BFI dataset but excluded from the LUMIERE one. The largest discrepancy is in the estimates for ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''; there is a difference of 5 million admissions, but LUMIERE do not include any UK data for 2002 while they do for other countries, which may explain the shortfall.

Re-releases also exacerbate the differences in some cases: both ''Star Wars Episode I'' and ''Titanic'' were successfully re-released in 2012, and while the LUMIERE dataset includes admissions from the reissues the BFI chart does not. While ''The Lion King'' did not generate 10 million admissions during its original release, it may have accumulated 10 million admissions due to a re-release: according to the BFI it had generated over 8 million admissions during its first run in 1994, and LUMIERE estimate it generated another 2 million with its 2011 reissue. If ''Bridget Jones'' and ''The Lion King'' are included, sixty-five sound films in total have generated over 10 million admissions at UK cinemas.

===Overview of the twentieth century===
In 2004, the British Film Institute published a list charting [[sound film]]s that generated the most admissions at cinemas in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="BFI research"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ultimate Film: Researching the Chart|date=November 2004|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/features/ultimatefilm/methodology.html |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is reproduced here ranking the top fifty films released in the UK throughout the [[twentieth century]], defined as covering the period from 1 January 1901 until 31 December 2000. The later films that appear on the BFI list—2001 onwards—are omitted from this chart for the purpose of providing an overview of the century. The second table ranks British sound productions from the twentieth century, five of which are co-productions with other countries.

Market conditions, industry practices, demographic and cultural shifts have all impacted on cinema attendance throughout the century. Cinemagoing steadily rose during the 1930s with the arrival of sound and peaked in the 1940s, with 1946 setting a record of over 1,635 million annual admissions; roughly equivalent to thirty visits to the cinema per capita. Attendance dropped off after the [[Second World War]], mainly due to the rising popularity of [[television]]. The decline of the cinema was compounded by the rise of [[home video]] in the 1980s and reached an all-time low of 54 million admissions in 1984.&lt;ref name="BFI cinemagoing"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ultimate Film: Cinemagoing in Britain|date=November 2004|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/features/ultimatefilm/cinemagoing.html |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With declining attendance came the closure of many cinemas; a trend that was not reversed until the birth of the [[multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] in the late 1980s, with annual cinema admissions climbing back up to around 176 million in 2002.&lt;ref name="BFI cinemagoing"/&gt;&lt;ref name=James&gt;{{cite web |last=James |first=Nick |title=Everything you knew about cinema is probably wrong|date=November 2004|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/features/ultimatefilm/feature.html |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As expected, the 1940s—when cinema attendance was at an all-time high—is the most represented decade on the chart accounting for nearly a third of all entries, while the 1980s—when attendance was at its lowest—is the least represented post-war decade.&lt;ref name="BFI research"/&gt; However, the disparity between the two extremes is not as great as the overall attendance figures suggest due to the fact that vastly more titles were distributed in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=James/&gt;

When comparing the films in the chart, several trends emerge. British films account for half the entries during the 1940s—as opposed to just one entry in the last twenty years of the century—due in part to the [[Cinematograph Films Act 1927|British government imposing quota caps on foreign features]], as well as the inherent difficulties in importing films during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="BFI research"/&gt; With so many men away on [[National service]], films that performed well were also heavily skewed toward female audiences, exemplified by no fewer than four films headlined by [[Anna Neagle]] during this period.&lt;ref name="BFI cinemagoing"/&gt;&lt;ref name=James/&gt; Prior to the 1980s when home video became popular, there was also a lot more repeat viewing, with some films during the 1950s and 60s enjoying extended runs—sometimes lasting up to several years—as [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshows]].&lt;ref name="BFI research"/&gt;&lt;ref name=James/&gt; A film's content can also have a prohibitive effect on its success: most films in the chart are either family or children's films, with only two films (''The Godfather'' and ''A Clockwork Orange'') carrying an [[X rating]] or its replacement, the [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 classification]], denying entry to minors.&lt;ref name="BFI facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ultimate Film: Interesting Facts|date=November 2004|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/features/ultimatefilm/facts.html |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, ''Gone with the Wind'' has generated the most admissions at the UK box office with 35 million and ''Spring in Park Lane'' is the most successful British sound film with 20 million, while 1938's ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' is the oldest film in the chart with 28 million admissions. While the chart does not take into account [[silent films]], 1916's ''[[The Battle of the Somme (film)|The Battle of the Somme]]'' is generally regarded to be the most successful film of the silent era, with over 20 million admissions.&lt;ref name="BFI facts"/&gt;

===Overview of the twenty-first century===
Film series and adaptations have been the highest earners in the twenty-first century, with only one film—''Avatar'' in 2009—that is not adapted from a pre-existing property or a sequel emerging as the highest-grossing film of the year. Since the British Film Institute does not regularly track admissions, the only complete metric available for assessing a film's success is the box office revenue, and over a period of time [[inflation]] of the currency becomes a key factor when comparing the relative success of films.&lt;ref name="BFI 2017a"&gt;{{cite web |title=Top Films of All Time at the UK Box Office |date=June 2017 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-top-films-of-all-time-2016-2017-06.pdf |accessdate=23 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820175630/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-top-films-of-all-time-2016-2017-06.pdf# |archive-date=20 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ticket prices rose rapidly at the beginning of the [[twenty-first century]], with the average cost increasing by over 50 per cent since 2000.&lt;ref name="tickets"&gt;{{cite news |title=UK cinema industry economics and turnover: Average ticket price – 2000 onwards |publisher=[[Cinema Exhibitors' Association]] |url=http://www.cinemauk.org.uk/the-industry/facts-and-figures/uk-cinema-industry-economics-and-turnover/average-ticket-price/ |accessdate=29 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203600/http://www.cinemauk.org.uk/the-industry/facts-and-figures/uk-cinema-industry-economics-and-turnover/average-ticket-price/# |archive-date=23 September 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end it is useful to adjust the box office gross for inflation, so a chart ranking films by the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real value]] of their earnings is provided alongside a chart of the years' biggest films. After recalculating the grosses using the [[HM Treasury]] UK [[GDP deflator]], ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' remains the most successful film of the twenty-first century.

The ''Harry Potter'' series is particularly well represented, topping the year on five occasions with two films in the adjusted top ten. The ''James Bond'' films and ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy also have a strong presence, with two films apiece among the top ten, adjusted for inflation. The top ten British productions adjusted for inflation are all international co-productions, and—with the exception of ''Mamma Mia''—are all ''Star Wars'', ''James Bond'' and ''Harry Potter'' films. Per the nominal record, ''The King's Speech'' replaces ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' as the most successful British production if the criteria is restricted to solely British-produced films.&lt;ref name="BFI 2017a" /&gt;

A '''model''' is a person with a [[role]] either to [[Promotion (marketing)|promote]], display or [[advertise]] commercial [[product (business)|products]] (notably [[fashion]] clothing in [[fashion show]]s), or to serve as a visual aid for people who are creating [[works of art]] or to pose for photography.

'''Modelling''' ("modeling" in [[British and American English spelling differences#Doubled consonants|American English]]) is considered to be different from other types of public [[performance]], such as acting or dancing. Although the difference between modelling and performing is not always clear, appearing in a film or a play is not generally considered to be "modelling".

Types of modelling include: fashion, glamour, fitness, bikini, fine art, body-part, promotional, and commercial print models. Models are featured in a variety of media formats including: books, magazines, films, newspapers, [[Internet modelling|internet]] and television. Fashion models are sometimes featured in films (''[[Prêt-à-Porter (film)|Prêt-à-Porter]]'' and ''[[Looker]]''); [[Reality television|reality TV]] shows (''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' and ''[[The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency]]''); and music videos ("[[Freedom! '90]]", "[[Wicked Game]]", "[[Daughters (John Mayer song)|Daughters]]" and "[[Blurred Lines]]").

[[Celebrities]], including actors, singers, [[sportsperson|sports personalities]] and reality TV stars, frequently take modelling contracts in addition to their regular work.

==History==
===Early years===
Modelling as a profession was first established in 1853 by [[Charles Frederick Worth]], the "father of [[haute couture]]", when he asked his wife, Marie Vernet Worth, to model the clothes he designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modelworker.com/history.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017020950/http://www.modelworker.com/history.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-10-17|title=modelworker.com|work=modelworker.com|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fabulous faces of fashion: A century of modelling|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/fabulous-faces-of-fashion-a--century-of-modelling-1678417.html|date=4 May 2009|author=Walker, Harriet|work=The Independent|journal=|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528025946/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/fabulous-faces-of-fashion-a--century-of-modelling-1678417.html|archive-date=2011-05-28|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[house model]]" was coined to describe this type of work. Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle époque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].

With the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1950s. One of the first well-known models was [[Lisa Fonssagrives]], who was very popular in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Ranck, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/09/books/the-first-supermodel.html "The First Supermodel"], ''[[New York Times]]'' February 9, 1997. Retrieved September 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers, and her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models. In 1946, [[Ford Models]] was established by [[Eileen Ford|Eileen]] and [[Gerard W. Ford|Gerard Ford]] in New York; it is one of the oldest model agencies in the world. One of the most popular models during the 1940s was [[Jinx Falkenburg]] who was paid $25 per hour, a large sum at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/Fashion_1940s_Modeling |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401102507/http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/Fashion_1940s_Modeling |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-04-01 |title=fashion models 1940s, fashion modeling in 1940, Forties Fashion modeling agencies, first fashion modeling agency in New York, 1940s fashion models, John Powers modeling agency, girls of the John Roberts Powers modeling agency, Powers Girls Photographs, popular 1 |publisher=Oldmagazinearticles.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s and 1950s, [[Wilhelmina Cooper]], [[Jean Patchett]], [[Dovima]], [[Dorian Leigh]], [[Suzy Parker]], [[Evelyn Tripp]], [[Carmen Dell'Orefice]], and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] dominated fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=CATHY HORYNPublished: February 04, 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/nyregion/jean-patchett-75-a-model-who-helped-define-the-50-s.html |title=Jean Patchett, 75, a Model Who Helped Define the 50's - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-02-04 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829054807/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/nyregion/jean-patchett-75-a-model-who-helped-define-the-50-s.html |archive-date=2012-08-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothea Church]] was among the first black models in the industry to gain recognition in Paris. However, these models were unknown outside the fashion community. Compared to today's models, the models of the 1950s were more voluptuous. [[Wilhelmina Cooper]]'s measurements were 38"-24"-36" whereas [[Chanel Iman]]'s measurements are 32"-23"-33".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/Chanel_Iman |title=Chanel Iman - Fashion Model - Profile on FMD |publisher=Fashionmodeldirectory.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830212536/http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/chanel_iman/ |archive-date=2012-08-30 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1960s and the beginning of the industry===
[[File:Jean Shrimpton (1965).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jean Shrimpton]] in 1965]]
In the 1960s, the modelling world began to establish [[Modeling agency|modelling agencies]]. Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

By the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Tania Mallet]], [[Celia Hammond]], [[Twiggy]], [[Penelope Tree]], and dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |title=David Bailey's favourite model Jean Shrimpton was the Shrimp who sparked the Sixties - Telegraph |publisher=Fashion.telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-19 |location=London |first=Lisa |last=Armstrong |date=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827035540/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |archive-date=2012-08-27 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twiggy became The Face of '66 at the age of 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211153058/http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-02-11 |title=Twiggy - The Official Site |publisher=Twiggylawson.co.uk |date=1966-02-23 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models. Twiggy, who stood at {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm}} with a 32" bust and had a boy's haircut, is credited with changing model ideals. At that time, she earned £80 an hour, while the average wage was £15 a week.

In 1967, seven of the top model agents in London formed the Association of London Model Agents. The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called [[Wilhelmina Models]]. By 1968, FM Agency and [[Models&amp;nbsp;1]] were established and represented models in a similar way that agencies do today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.models1.co.uk/contact.aspx?nav=23 |title=Europe's Leading Model Agency |publisher=Models 1 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020130053/http://www.models1.co.uk/contact.aspx?nav=23 |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmmodelagency.com/contact.aspx?nav=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928133313/http://www.fmmodelagency.com/contact.aspx?nav=2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-09-28 |title=FM Agency - London - Contact |publisher=Fmmodelagency.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1960s, models were treated better and were making better wages. One of the innovators, Ford Models, was the first agency to advance models money they were owed and would often allow teen models, who did not live locally, to reside in their house, a precursor to model housing.

===The 1970s and 1980s===
The innovations of the 1960s flowed into the 1970s fashion scene. As a result of model industry associations and standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.models1.co.uk/contact.aspx?nav=24 |title=Europe's Leading Model Agency |publisher=Models&amp;nbsp;1 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914131034/http://www.models1.co.uk/contact.aspx?nav=24 |archive-date=2010-09-14 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; model agencies became more business minded, and more thought went into a model's promotional materials. By this time, agencies were starting to pay for a model's publicity.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  In the early 1970s, [[Scandinavia]] had many tall, leggy, [[blond]]e-haired, blue-eyed models and not enough clients. It was during this time that Ford Models pioneered scouting.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; They would spend time working with agencies holding modelling contests. This was the precursor to the [[Ford Models Supermodel of the World]] competition which was established in 1980. Ford also focused their attentions on Brazil which had a wide array of seemingly "exotic" models, which eventually led to establishment of Ford Models Brazil. It was also during this time that the ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'' debuted. The magazine set a trend by photographing "bigger and healthier" California models,&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2113612/|title=The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue: An intellectual history|author=Curtis, Bryan|accessdate=11 November 2007|date=16 February 2005|publisher=Washington Post.

The 1970s marked numerous milestones in fashion. [[Beverly Johnson]] was the first [[African Americans|African American]] to appear on the cover of U.S. [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'']] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Joy Sewing [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/features/6583995.html Beverly Johnson's got the right attitude] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826163234/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/features/6583995.html |date=2009-08-26 }} ''The Houston Chronicle'', Retrieved 23 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Models, including [[Iman (model)|Iman]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Alva Chinn]], [[Donyale Luna]], [[Minah Bird]], [[Naomi Sims]], and [[Toukie Smith]] were some of the top black fashion models who paved the way for black women in fashion. In 1975, [[Margaux Hemingway]] landed a then-unprecedented million-dollar contract as the face of [[Fabergé (cosmetics)|Fabergé]]'s Babe perfume and the same year appeared on the cover of ''Time'' magazine, labelled one of the "New Beauties", giving further name recognition to fashion models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fonseca |first=Nicholas |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,256227,00.html |title=Entertainment Weekly: ''Papa's Little Girl'' |publisher=Ew.com |date=29 June 2001 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106020603/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,256227,00.html |archive-date=2010-01-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the world's most prominent modelling agencies were established in the 1970s and early 1980s. These agencies created the standard by which agencies now run. In 1974, Nevs Models was established in London with only a men's board, the first of its kind. Elite Models was founded in Paris in 1975 as well as Friday's Models in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fridayfarm.net/about_us.html |title=About Us |publisher=Fridayfarm.net |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908041728/http://www.fridayfarm.net/about_us.html |archive-date=2012-09-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elitemodelsindia.com/index.asp |title=Elite Model Management India Pvt.

In 1977, Select Model Management opened its doors as well as Why Not Models in Milan. By the 1980s, agencies such as Premier Model Management, Storm Models, Mikas, Marilyn, and Metropolitan Models had been established.

In October 1981, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' cited [[Shelley Hack]], Lauren Hutton and Iman for [[Revlon]], Margaux Hemingway for [[Faberge (cosmetics)|Fabergé]], [[Karen Graham]] for [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]], [[Christina Ferrare]] for [[Max Factor]], and Cheryl Tiegs for [[CoverGirl]] by proclaiming them the "million dollar faces" of the beauty industry. These models negotiated previously unheard of lucrative and exclusive deals with giant cosmetics companies, were instantly recognizable, and their names became well known to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Best–Selling Beauties, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' October 1981, page 120&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, most models were able to make modelling a full-time career. It was common for models to travel abroad and work throughout Europe. As modelling became global, numerous agencies began to think globally. In 1980, Ford Models, the innovator of scouting, introduced the [[Ford Models Supermodel of the World]] contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supermodeloftheworld.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001206212100/http://www.supermodeloftheworld.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2000-12-06 |title=Ford Models Supermodel of the World |publisher=Supermodeloftheworld.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; That same year, John Casablancas opened [[Elite Models]] in New York. In 1981, cosmetics companies began contracting top models to lucrative [[Testimonial|endorsement deals]]. By 1983, Elite developed its own contest titled the Elite Model Look competition. In New York during the 1980s there were so-called "model wars" in which the Ford and Elite agencies fought over models and campaigns. Models were jumping back and forth between agencies such Elite, Wilhelmina, and Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rayl |first=Salley |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20077110,00.html |title=The Fashion World Is Rocked by Model Wars, Part Two: the Ford Empire Strikes Back |publisher=People.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120212730/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20077110,00.html |archive-date=2012-11-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, the late 1980s trend was the boyish look in which models had short cropped hair and looked [[androgynous]]. In Europe, the trend was the exact opposite. During this time, a lot of American models who were considered more feminine looking moved abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Like |url=http://vimeo.com/13134831 |title=Kitchen Table Conversation with Cindy Morris and Roxan Gould on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2010-07-06 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513115807/http://vimeo.com/13134831 |archive-date=2013-05-13 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1980s, big hair was made popular by some musical groups, and the boyish look was out. The curvaceous models who had been popular in the 1950s and early 1970s were in style again. Models like [[Patti Hansen]] earned $200 an hour for print and $2,000 for television plus [[Residual (entertainment industry)|residuals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clurman |first=Shirley |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20075859,00.html |title=Who Is Patti Hansen?

===The 1990s to present===
[[File:NaomiCampbell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|[[Naomi Campbell]], one of the most famous supermodels]]
The early 1990s were dominated by the high fashion models of the late 1980s. In 1990, [[Linda Evangelista]] famously said to ''Vogue'', "we don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day". Evangelista and her contemporaries, [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Cindy Crawford]], [[Christy Turlington]], [[Tatjana Patitz]] and [[Stephanie Seymour]], became arguably the most recognizable models in the world, earning the moniker of "[[supermodel]]", and were boosted to global recognition and new heights of wealth for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

[[File:Kate moss.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Kate Moss]], leader of the [[heroin chic]] movement]]
By the mid‑1990s, the new "[[heroin chic]]" movement became popular amongst New York and London editorial clients. [[Kate Moss]] became its poster child through her ads for [[Calvin Klein]]. In spite of the heroin chic movement, model [[Claudia Schiffer]] earned $12&amp;nbsp;million. With the popularity of lingerie retailer [[Victoria's Secret]], and the ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'', there was a need for healthier-looking{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} supermodels such as [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Heidi Klum]] to meet commercial modelling demand. The mid‑1990s also saw many Asian countries establishing modelling agencies.

By the late 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired clothing infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen [[pop music]] was on the rise, and artists such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] popularized [[Artificial leather|pleather]] and bare midriffs. As fashion changed to a more youthful [[Demography|demographic]], the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following [[Gisele Bundchen]]'s breakthrough, a wave of [[Brazil]]ian models including [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s. Some have tied this increase in Brazilian models to the trend of magazines featuring celebrities instead of models on their covers.&lt;ref name="um"&gt;''Death of the Supermodels'' by C. L.

[[File:Gemma Ward.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Gemma Ward]], an Australian model]]
In the late 2000s, the Brazilians fell out of favour on the runways. Editorial clients were favouring models with a china-doll or alien look to them, such as [[Gemma Ward]] and [[Lily Cole]]. During the 2000s, Ford Models and [[NEXT Model Management]] were engaged in a legal battle, with each agency alleging that the other was stealing its models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2010/05/24/model-agency-wars-next-vs-ford |title=Model agency wars Next vs Ford (Vogue.com UK) |publisher=Vogue.co.uk |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110111653/http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2010/05/24/model-agency-wars-next-vs-ford |archive-date=2012-11-10 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the biggest controversy of the 2000s was the health of high-fashion models participating in fashion week. While the health of models had been a concern since the 1970s, there were several high-profile news stories surrounding the deaths of young fashion models due to [[eating disorder]]s and [[drug abuse]]. The [[British Fashion Council]] subsequently asked designers to sign a contract stating they would not use models under the age of sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/fashion/160449/underage-models-banned-at-london-fashion-week.html |title=Fashion news: Underage models banned at London Fashion Week |publisher=Marie Claire |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115194925/http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/fashion/160449/underage-models-banned-at-london-fashion-week.html |archive-date=2012-11-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 3, 2012, ''Vogue'' banned models under the age of sixteen as well as models who appeared to have an eating disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/47286154/ns/today-style/t/vogue-bans-models-who-are-too-skinny-underage/#.UELGL1tQfwk |title=Vogue bans models who are too skinny, underage - style - TODAY.com |publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004234251/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/47286154/ns/today-style/t/vogue-bans-models-who-are-too-skinny-underage/#.UELGL1tQfwk |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other countries placed bans on unhealthy, and underage models, including [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and [[Israel]], which all enacted a minimum [[body mass index]] (BMI) requirement.

In 2013, New York toughened its child labor law protections for models under the age of eighteen by passing New York Senate Bill No. 5486, which gives underage models the same labor protections afforded to child actors.  Key new protections included the following: underage models are not to work before 5:00 pm or after 10:00 pm on school nights, nor were they to work later than 12:30 am on non-school nights; the models may not return to work less than twelve hours after they leave; a pediatric nurse must be on site; models under sixteen must be accompanied by an adult chaperone; parents or guardians of underage models must create a trust fund account into which employers will transfer a minimum of 15% of the [[child model]]'s gross earnings; and employers must set aside time and a dedicated space for educational instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Darwell|first=Robert A.|author2=Theodore C.

Runway models showcase clothes from fashion designers, fashion media, and consumers. They are also called "live models" and are self-employed. They are wanted to be over the height of 5'8" for men and 5'6" for women. Runway models work in different locations, constantly travelling between those cities where fashion is well known—[[London Fashion Week|London]], [[Milan Fashion Week|Milan]], [[New York Fashion Week|New York City]], and [[Paris Fashion Week|Paris]]. Second-tier international fashion center cities include: [[Rome]], [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Brescia]], [[Barcelona]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Tokyo]], and [[Moscow]]. Cities where catalog work comprises the bulk of fashion packaging, merchandising and marketing work are: [[Miami]], [[San Francisco]], [[Sydney]], [[Chicago]], [[Toronto]], [[Mexico City]], [[Tokyo]], [[Hamburg]], [[London]], and {{cn-span|text=[[Beijing]]|date=October 2016}}.

The criteria for runway models include certain height and weight requirements. During runway shows, models have to constantly change clothes and makeup. Models walk, turn, and stand in order to demonstrate a garment's key features. Models also go to interviews (called "go and sees") to present their portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rusu|first=M|title=Interview with Catwalk Model Rusu|url=http://expatriatesmagazine.com/index.php/publication/issue-1/contents/item/163-interview-with-monica-rusu-expat-model|work=Expatriates Magazine|location=Paris|page=33|format=Printed Publication|date=April 2013|access-date=2013-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019160427/http://expatriatesmagazine.com/index.php/publication/issue-1/contents/item/163-interview-with-monica-rusu-expat-model|archive-date=2013-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more experience a model has, the more likely she/he is to be hired for a fashion show. A runway model can also work in other areas, such as department store fashion shows, and the most successful models sometimes create their own product lines or go into acting.&lt;ref name="modelingbook1"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Vogt | first =Peter | authorlink = |author2=Angie Wojak | title =Career Opportunities in the Fashion Industry | publisher =Info base Publishing | year =2007 | location = | pages =191–192 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8160-6841-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|191–192}}

Male and female models must also possess clear skin, healthy hair, and attractive facial features. Stringent weight and body proportion guidelines form the selection criteria by which established, and would‑be, models are judged for their placement suitability, on an ongoing basis. There can be some variation regionally, and by market tier, subject to current prevailing trends at any point, in any era, by agents, agencies and end-clients.

Plus-size models are models who generally have larger measurements than editorial fashion models. The primary use of plus-size models is to appear in advertising and runway shows for plus-size labels. Plus-size models are also engaged in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., [[stock photography]] and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines. Some plus-size models have appeared in runway shows and campaigns for mainstream retailers and designers such as Gucci, Guess, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Levi's and Versace Jeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwd.com/media-news/advertising/qa-paul-marciano-on-30-years-of-guess-campaigns-5882940 |title=Q&amp;A: Paul Marciano on 30 Years of Guess Campaigns |author=Tran, Khan T.L. |date=1 May 2012 |work=wwd.com |publisher=Women's Wear Daily |accessdate=12 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706050948/http://www.wwd.com/media-news/advertising/qa-paul-marciano-on-30-years-of-guess-campaigns-5882940 |archive-date=2012-07-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fashion%27s+new+Dahling%3B+ALL+WOMAN%3A+SOPHIE+MAKES+A+COMEBACK+WITH+THREE...-a063096063 |title=Fashion's new Dahling; All Woman: Sophie Makes A Comeback with Three New Contracts and a Sexy, Slimmer Look. |author=Brown, Annie |date=3 July 2000 |publisher=The Daily Record |accessdate=15 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124720/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fashion%27s+new+Dahling%3B+ALL+WOMAN%3A+SOPHIE+MAKES+A+COMEBACK+WITH+THREE...-a063096063 |archive-date=2013-10-19 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Serpe, Gina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/292057/anna-nicole-smith-s-death-five-years-on-timeline-of-a-tragedy |title=Anna Nicole Smith's Death Five Years On: Timeline of a Tragedy |author=Serpe, Gina |date=8 February 2012 |work=people.com |publisher=People Magazine |accessdate=13 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012182511/http://www.eonline.com/news/292057/anna-nicole-smith-s-death-five-years-on-timeline-of-a-tragedy |archive-date=2012-10-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://models.com/work/levis-boyfriend-collection-fw10/60882 |title=Levi's Boyfriend Collection F/W 10 |work=models.com |accessdate=20 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513085352/http://models.com/work/levis-boyfriend-collection-fw10/60882 |archive-date=2012-05-13 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fit models====

A fit model works as a sort of live mannequin to give designers and pattern makers feedback on the fit, feel, movement, and drape of a garment to be produced in a given size.

===Glamour models===
{{Main article|Glamour photography}}
[[File:Glamour Models on Red Carpet.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Glamour models posing on the red carpet — Hollywood, California]]
Glamour modelling focuses on sexuality and thus general requirements are often unclear, being dependent more on each individual case. Glamour models can be any size or shape. There is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in [[calendar]]s, [[men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Playboy]]'', [[bikini]] modelling, [[lingerie]] modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.

It is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,&lt;ref name="bbc3651850"&gt;{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Magazine &amp;#124; Page Three girls - the naked truth |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models. From 1970 models appeared topless. In the 1980s, ''The Sun''{{'s}} competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.&lt;ref name="bbc3651850"/&gt; It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of [[Samantha Fox]]. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.

It was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |url=https://www.amazon.com/Rebel-Heart-American-Rock-Journey/dp/0312266944 |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724065801/http://www.amazon.com/Rebel-Heart-American-Rock-Journey/dp/0312266944 |archive-date=2012-07-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.

In the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blackburn |first=Jen |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4365325/I-was-so-happy-to-be-pregnant-but-I-couldnt-smile-with-dodgy-facial-implants-that-ruined-it-says-former-glamour-model-and-plastic-surgery-addict-Alicia-Douvall.html |title=Alicia Douvall Baby: Plastic surgery addict opens up to The Sun &amp;#124; The Sun &amp;#124;Showbiz&amp;#124;TV |publisher=The Sun |date=2012-06-11 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816135347/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4365325/I-was-so-happy-to-be-pregnant-but-I-couldnt-smile-with-dodgy-facial-implants-that-ruined-it-says-former-glamour-model-and-plastic-surgery-addict-Alicia-Douvall.html |archive-date=2012-08-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Cara |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3583174/Katie-Price-parties-with-Peter-Andres-ex-Maddy-Ford.html |title=Katie Price parties with Peter Andre's ex Maddy Ford &amp;#124; The Sun &amp;#124;Showbiz&amp;#124;TV |publisher=The Sun |date=2011-05-16 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729021835/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3583174/Katie-Price-parties-with-Peter-Andres-ex-Maddy-Ford.html |archive-date=2011-07-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gente |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |title='Interviú' desnuda a Nereida Gallardo, la novia de Cristiano Ronaldo |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221153140/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |archive-date=2011-12-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as [[Katie Price]], became household names.

Some models are employed for their body parts. For example, [[hand model]]s may be used to promote products held in the hand and [[nail (anatomy)|nail]]-related products. (e.g. rings, other jewelry or [[nail polish]]).

===Fitness models===

[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]
Fitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.

===Gravure idols===
A {{nihongo4|gravure idol|グラビアアイドル|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|グラドル|guradoru}}, is a Japanese female model who primarily models on magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs.

{{nihongo4|"Gurabia"|グラビア}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from "[[rotogravure]]", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features. The rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, [[postcard]]s, and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] product packaging.&lt;ref name="kelana"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jimi Okelana|title=Japan 101: Guide to Gravure Idols|url=http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=Axiom Magazine|date=March 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728194637/http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|archivedate=28 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravure idols appear in a wide range of photography styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular [[Japanese idol|female idols in Japan]] launched their careers by starting out as gravure idols.&lt;ref name="kelana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Springer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galbraith, P. W., Karlin, J. G. (Eds.)|title=Idols and Celebrity in Japanese Media Culture|publisher=Springer, 2012|isbn=1137283785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial print and on-camera models===
Commercial print models generally appear in print ads for non-fashion products, and in television commercials. Commercial print models can earn up to $250 an hour. Commercial print models are usually non-exclusive, and primarily work in one location.

There are several large fashion agencies that have commercial print divisions, including Ford Models in the United States.

===Promotional models===
{{Main article|Promotional model}}
[[File:IZIBA2004 056 (1924606).jpg|thumb|Two models with the logo of [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]], a cigarette brand they are promoting, printed on the backside of their shorts in [[Ibiza]], 2004]]
A promotional model is a model hired to drive [[consumer demand]] for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.

[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.

====Spokesmodels====
{{main article|Spokesmodel}}
"Spokesmodel" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.

====Trade show models====
[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.

====Atmosphere models====
[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]
'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a "Brazilian Day" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party.

====Podium models====
[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]
'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.

===Art models===
{{Main article|Model (art)}}
[[File:Nude model in sculpture studio, c. 1912.jpg|thumb|140px|Art school model, c. 1912]]
'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.

===Instagram models===
'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.&lt;ref name=Saul&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; American male model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.&lt;ref name=Spinks&gt;{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],&lt;ref name=Saul/&gt; promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.&lt;ref name=Spinks/&gt; High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands. When choosing whom to employ, brands have become less concerned with the number of followers an influencer has and more focussed on their [[engagement marketing]] strategy. Research indicates that 89 per cent of influencers use Instagram to promote themselves compared to 20 per cent using Twitter and 16 per cent using Facebook.&lt;ref name=Saul/&gt;

Some Instagram models have gained high-profile modelling jobs and become [[celebrities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.maxim.com/tag/instagram-models| work=Maxim| title=Instagram Models| accessdate=2016-05-01| 5=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502002352/http://www.maxim.com/tag/instagram-models| archive-date=2016-05-02| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Moldova-Film''''' ({{lang-ro|Moldova-film}}, {{lang-ru|Молдова-филм}}) is a [[Moldova]]n film studio and production company founded in 1952 in the [[Moldavian SSR]].

==History==
Moldova-Film was founded in 1947 in [[Chişinău]] as a branch of the [[Central Studio for Documentary Film]]. In 1949 the branch was taken over by the [[Odessa Film Studio]] and in 1952 became an independent film studio as the Moldovan Newsreel Documentary Studio. In 1957 the studio was reorganized and renamed into Moldovan Studio for Feature and Newsreel Documentary Studio, or Moldova-Film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollberg|first=Peter|title=Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Cinema|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cuw1vHuxITYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA274,M1|year=2008|pages=274&amp;ndash;277|isbn=0-8108-6072-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

V. Sevelev became the first director. January 24, 1957 the branch was transformed into a studio of artistic and documentary movies and was called "Moldova-Film". During Soviet times, five artistic units made part of the company: "Arta", "Lumina", "Luceafarul", "Panorama", "Steluta", producing every year up to six long play movies (three of which under order of the Central Television), four cartoons, 25 documentaries and 20 scientific and educational films, as well 12 issues of cinema magazine ''Soviet Moldavia'' and six copies of humoristic magazine ''Usturich''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15234">A '''music supervisor''' is a person who combines [[music]] and visual media. According to The Guild of Music Supervisors, a music supervisor is “a qualified professional who oversees all music related aspects of film, television, advertising, video games and other existing or emerging visual media platforms as required.”&lt;ref name="Guild of Music Supervisors"&gt;Guild of Music Supervisors. {{cite web |url=http://www.guildofmusicsupervisors.com/the-role/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202020208/http://www.guildofmusicsupervisors.com/the-role/ |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[musical theatre]] industry, a music supervisor is often responsible for managing a team of music directors working on any number of musical productions.

==Description==

A music supervisor is somebody with a broad and encyclopedic music expertise and a sophisticated knowledge of music licensing and negotiation. Typically, a music supervisor proposes previously recorded songs to the director or producer of a film, advertisement, television show, trailer, promo, video game, or any other form of visual media.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"&gt;Sobel, Ron, and Dick Weissman. Music Publishing: The Roadmap to Royalties. New York: Routledge, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A music supervisor will usually act as a liaison between the creative and business ends of the process.&lt;ref name="Baskerville, David 2006"&gt;Baskerville, David, PHD.

Sage Publications, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Once a song is approved, they approach the rights holders of that song to seek permission to license (usually creating master recording licenses and [[Synchronization rights|synchronization licenses]]) and to work out the financial details of the song’s use. In many instances, the artist or songwriter of the recorded song is given the opportunity to accept or decline the synchronization of their song.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"/&gt; This position is most active within media-based industries, including live events, television, film, advertising, theatre, and video gaming.&lt;ref&gt;Wentz, Brook.

Hal Leonard Books, NY NY.&lt;/ref&gt;  Music supervisors may work within production companies, film studios, networks, music supervision companies, or do freelance work.

==Job responsibilities==

A supervisor’s responsibilities are to locate, secure and oversee music related talent. They liaise between the rights holders of the recorded music involved and the director of the project they have been hired to work on. In addition, they advise, generate and work within financial parameters of the project they are hired to work on. They must deliver musical elements within a timely manner and secure legal rights of the song before it is used. The music supervisor will gather the appropriate information to list credits and, in certain cases, will manage royalty collection.

The overarching responsibility of a music supervisor is to meet the needs of a project’s director and producer. This means catering to the creative goals of a project under a strict budget: often less than 5% of a project’s total budget.

The director/producer will discuss their vision for the project with the music supervisor, and how they expect the music to enhance this vision. The visual media will then be spotted by the supervisor – a process of choosing where selected music will be inserted. Traditional spots include the main title, opening credits, and closing credits, while additional spots are incorporated to trigger emotional responses from viewers. Scores, or background music, are also an important consideration for enhancing visual media. Scores can range from the background to a dramatic scene to television bumpers – the music signifying leading into or coming back from a commercial break.

After being given or creating a budget, the supervisor must select appropriate music for the project – either by licensing existing songs/scores, or creating new songs/scores. In the selection process, a music supervisor may choose to seek the help of a third party licensing company or a music publisher, which will pitch songs to the supervisor from within their library of music. If creating new music, the supervisor may become responsible for additional roles, including securing artists or composers, facilitating the production and recording process, overseeing finances, and finalizing post-theatrical uses of the soundtrack.When using pre-existing music, the supervisor’s duties focus on the legal and financial aspects of licensing and negotiating. A large percentage of a music supervisor’s job revolves around music clearance alone.

When it comes to royalty collections, a music supervisor will sometimes be in charge of arranging this source of the selected artist's revenue. Royalties for music placements are paid out by Performance Rights Organizations (such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC in the United States). In order to detect the placements an artist has made with visual media, these companies need to be aware of their placement. Depending on the type of project (ad placement, television show, etc.). the music supervisor will have to either make sure the artist is credited properly, send video clips of the placement to the publisher (which will then be sent to the proper Performance Rights Organization),or create a cue sheet of all of the songs used in the project

Many directors and producers will choose to work with a single supervisor for a project, however it varies from project to project. For example, music supervisors can be hired at an entertainment company as an “in house” staff member to manage the supervision for several projects (such as at an advertising agency). A production company may also hire a supervisor on a project-by-project basis (such as hiring one supervisor for an entire television series as seen with Gossip Girl or The O.C.). Music supervisors may also be hired on a show-by-show basis (ex. AMC’s Mad Men, which has used multiple music supervisors).

==Qualifications/background==

A music supervisor must have a wide knowledge of music and a passion for musical research.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"/&gt; There is no set educational or career path to become a music supervisor.  Educational backgrounds range from Bachelor of Fine Arts in music to business degrees to no higher education at all (Baskerville).  Because the majority of the position involves music negotiations, clearances, publishing/performing deals, etc., a legal background is an excellent qualification. Some supervisors are musicians, producers, agents, or managers – experience with the music or film/television industries is a strong background upon which to build. Despite common misconceptions, musical knowledge (writing, reading, performing, composing) is not nearly as important as a familiarity with a broad range of music, including popular styles and artists, as well as the production/negotiating process itself (Baskerville). Author of ''Music Business Handbook and Career Guide'' David Baskerville notes "This is one of the few production specialties that has almost unlimited growth potential, because there [is] no universally accepted job description. The field remains wide open to people with connections and the ability to get the job done."

The proliferation of video technology has resulted in an increased demand for production companies needing to license music, and the field now accommodates many career professionals. Because of the massive expansion in the field, many colleges and universities offer courses in music supervision. For example, NYU Steinhardt’s Music Business program offers a course titled “Strategic Music and Branding”.&lt;ref name="NYU Curriculum"&gt;"Music Business Curriculum." NYU Steinhardt. New York University, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salary==

Music supervisor salaries vary depending upon the project and the hiring process.  Salaries can range from $35,000 annually at a music supervision firm, to upwards of $250,000 for a freelance supervisor per feature film (Austin). Music supervisors also have the opportunity to continue receiving funds through soundtrack royalties.  It is generally more profitable (assuming one will be regularly hired) to work freelance jobs than to work for a larger corporation. However some supervisors may choose to work within a music supervision company (such as Chop Shop Music Supervision). In addition, music supervisors who work "in house" within an entertainment, such as an advertising agency or within the music department of a production company, will earn a salary based upon their ranking and company earnings. While staff jobs with a network, studio, or production company offer more security, the recognition and pay are significantly lower.  Despite the environment, a music supervisor should always work out a contract including expectations, responsibilities, and payment before beginning a project.

==History==
Originally, music was used in silent films to hide mechanical noises within a theatre, like the projector.  Often a musician would be present to play improvised or pre-selected pieces along with the visual images on screen.&lt;ref name="Schulenberg, Richard 1999"&gt;Schulenberg, Richard.  Legal Aspects of the Music Industry: An Insider’s View. 1999. Billboard Books, New York New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the establishment of the soundtrack, and an emphasis on accompanying silent visual media with music.&lt;ref name="Schulenberg, Richard 1999"/&gt; Over time, films began hiring composers to create instrumental soundtracks to accompany films. It became apparent to studios that when a movie included a hit song, more people were likely to see it, and as a result of that, more people were likely to purchase the song recording.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"/&gt; The demand for music supervisors in the production process solidified in the 1980s, and has continued to grow with the popularity of media soundtracks.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, D., Austin, C., Peterik, Jim. Songwriting for Dummies, 2nd Edition. 2010. Wiley Publishing, Inc., Hoboken, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; While the use of songs not originally composed for the film did not save money, licensing a song made for a more stable understanding for the director and producer of the film what music was going to be  used in the scene. Instead of having to wait for new instrumental music to be commissioned, they could have an understanding of what recording would be used before the film was finalized. This led to an emerging need for selecting and licensing songs, which is how the position of music supervisor developed.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"/&gt; Taking advantage of this musical component has become an increasingly feasible marketing strategy for these media outlets, placing a growing responsibility on the music supervisor.&lt;ref name="Baskerville, David 2006"/&gt;

Over the past decade, synchronization licensing has become one of the most significant ways for an artist to gain exposure and to earn money. Finding a way to a music supervisor can give an artist the opportunity to spread their music on a platform that would expose them to a much larger audience than they may have been able to find on their own. One of the most notable synchronization collaborations was with Moby’s 1999 album Play, which was the first ever to have all of its tracks linked to a synchronization license.&lt;ref name="Organization Moby"&gt;Smith, Ethan. "Organization Moby." Wired May 2002.https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.05/moby.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The job of a music supervisor has only recently become increasingly significant and the importance of this position continues to grow. Institutions such as the Guild of Music Supervisors are promoting the understanding of music supervision. In 2007 several supervisors, in order to promote, pursue and recognize the craft of music supervision. Since 2011 guild has granted awards for excellence in the position. They encourage other institutions, such as the Hollywood Music and Media Awards, to acknowledge accomplishments in the field.&lt;ref name="Guild of Music Supervisors"/&gt;

'''''Okhlos''''' (stylized as '''''OKHLOS''''') is an [[Action game|action]] [[roguelike]] [[video game]] developed by [[Argentina]]-based independent video game developer [[Coffee Powered Machine]] and published by [[Devolver Digital]]. It was released on 18 August 2016.

== Plot ==
''Okhlos'' is set in [[ancient Greece]], where the land is ruled by the [[Olympian gods]], who are highly praised by the people.&lt;ref name="KS: Mob mentality"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://killscreendaily.com/articles/okhlos-turns-ancient-greece-explore-phenomenon-mob-mentality/ | title = Okhlos turns to Ancient Greece to explore the phenomenon of mob mentality | last = Rudin | first = David | date = 14 May 2015 | website = [[Kill Screen]] | publisher = [[Kill Screen Media]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the game's [[protagonist]], an unnamed philosopher, is critical about their behaviour, as they show no signs of interest in the human [[well-being]].&lt;ref name="RPS: Greek Pikmin"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/20/mob-rules-okhlos-is-insane-ancient-greek-pikmin/ | title = Mob Rules: Okhlos Is Insane Ancient Greek Pikmin | last = Grayson | first = Nathan | date = 20 January 2014 | website = [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, when the philosopher suddenly witnesses, how [[the School of Athens]] is bruised down by one of the god's foot, killing everyone inside, he decides to take action.&lt;ref name="Poly: Mob justice"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2015/8/29/9225083/mob-justice-is-the-central-philosophy-of-okhlos | title = Mob justice is the central philosophy of Okhlos | last = Campbell | first = Collin | date = 29 August 2015 | website = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | publisher = [[Vox Media]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going from city to city, he convinces the people that the gods are no good for mankind, as they turn people into animals, impregnate women and kill innocents, and recruits them to form a giant mob.&lt;ref name="Poly: Mob justice" /&gt; As the mob grows, the philosopher continues executing his plan to overthrow the gods, kill their minions, and form an [[ochlocracy]], while his mob destroys everything standing in their way.&lt;ref name="RPS: Greek Pikmin" /&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''Okhlos'' is often compared to ''[[Pikmin]]'', as the player rules over a huge mob, directing it to go to the commanded spots,&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Imagine Pikmin"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/imagine-pikmin-but-with-greek-philosophers-1510025170 | title = Imagine ''Pikmin'', But With Greek Philosophers | last = Person | first = Chris | date = 27 January 2014 | website = [[Kotaku]] | publisher = [[Gawker Media]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in combination with ''[[Katamari]]'' for the fast-paced action.&lt;ref name="Destructoid: Okhlos has Katamari vibes"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/devolver-digital-s-okhlos-has-katamari-vibes-with-a-mob-twist-340722.phtml | title = Devolver Digital's Okhlos has Katamari vibes with a mob twist | last = Carter | first = Chris | date = 11 February 2016 | website = [[Destructoid]] | publisher = [[ModernMethod]] | accessdate = 11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon touching, the mob will automatically start tearing down buildings, attack enemies or recruit new people.&lt;ref name="Poly: Mob justice" /&gt; Additionally, the player can make the mob block or spread around the city they are in to protect the player from enemies or hazards.&lt;ref name="KS: Mob mentality" /&gt; The game's eight worlds are [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]], each featuring different hazards and enemies to face.&lt;ref name="PD: All hail the mob"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pixeldynamo.com/news/gaming/2015/05/14/63811/hail-mob-okhlos-seeks-greenlight-approval-steam/ | title = All hail the mob: Okhlos seeks Greenlight approval on Steam | last = Pursaill | first = James | date = 14 May 2015 | website = [[Pixel Dynamo]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every city includes shops, in which the player may buy upgrades for individual units of the mob, or increase the number of people able to join it.&lt;ref name="YT: Cannata"&gt;{{cite AV media | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82FMDitsG0c | title = OKHLOS: Wreak Havoc through Ancient Greece! PAX 2015 | last = Cannata | first = Jeff | date = 31 August 2015 | website = [[YouTube]] | publisher = [[Google]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that, the player may, in the shops, also trade units for famous Greek philosophers and heroes, such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Heracles]].&lt;ref name="IGM: BIG preview"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://indiegamemag.com/big-festival-preview-okhlos/ | title = BIG Festival Preview - Okhlos | last = Viana | first = Bhernardo | date = 8 July 2015 | website = [[Indie Game Magazine]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the game, the player will face and battle all of the [[Twelve Olympians]], as well as randomly encountering other major enemies, like the [[Oracle of Delphi]] or the [[Minotaur]].&lt;ref name="PD: All hail the mob" /&gt; In case the player dies, he will take over one of the philosophers from the mob, except if there is no philosophers left, which will cause the player to lose.&lt;ref name="IGM: BIG preview" /&gt;

== Development ==
Development on ''Okhlos'' started in November 2012, after Argentinian indie studio Coffee Powered Machine released the ''Enhanced Edition'' of their previous title, ''[[Gravity Fleet]]'', to the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] on 13 November 2012.&lt;ref name="IGN: App Store Update"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/13/app-store-update-november-13 | title = App Store Update: November 13 | last = Thomas | first = Lucas M. | date = 13 November 2012 | website = [[IGN]] | publisher = [[IGN Entertainment]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team decided to create a game about an angry mob in ancient Greece, consisting of mythological heroes, that is fighting the Olympian gods.&lt;ref name="TechRaptor: Interview"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://techraptor.net/content/mob-rules-okhlos-interview | title = Mob Rules – An Okhlos Interview | last = Ruhland | first = Perry | date = 12 September 2015 | website = [[TechRaptor]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team started off working on the [[non-player character]]'s [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]] behavior, and continued working on core mechanics for the game's "angry mob" concept. When procedural generation was implemented into the game, the team was unhappy about its simple algorithm and instead shifted their design focus to static, pre-built worlds. A longer silent development phase took place, until they revealed the new designs and mechanics, and also the different gameplay types the tested, on 26 June 2013.&lt;ref name="CPM: Gameplay Prototypes"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://coffeepoweredmachine.com/dev-blog-prototyping-different-gameplays/ | title = [Dev Blog] Prototyping different gameplays | last = Rey | first = Roque | date = 26 June 2013 | website = [[Coffee Powered Machine]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 24 prototypes were created, which included, but was not limited to, a [[beat 'em up]], a [[stealth game]] and the [[roguelike]] style the decided to build on.&lt;ref name="TechRaptor: Interview" /&gt; Another successful six months of development went by, to the point, where Coffee Powered Machine decided to get to work on the procedural generation algorithm again, and therefore dropped the static worlds in early 2014. However, the project nearly ceased, as the team ran out of money shortly after, but where help up by private investors.&lt;ref name="TechRaptor: Interview" /&gt; The development could continue and the team made a lot of progress by the end of 2014.&lt;ref name="CPM: A year in review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://coffeepoweredmachine.com/okhlos-a-year-in-review-2014/ | title = Okhlos: A year in review (2014) | last = Rey | first = Roque | date = 30 December 2014 | website = [[Coffee Powered Machine]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This progress later led to the game being sent to the [[Independent Games Festival]] 2015, which was held from 2 March 2015 until 6 March 2015 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="IGF: Okhlos"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2015.php?id=8189 | title = The 17th Annual Independent Games Festival - Okhlos | date = 2 March 2015 | website = [[Independent Games Festival]] | publisher = [[UBM TechWeb]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it was announced to be featured in the Leftfield Collection at [[EGX Rezzed]] 2015, which took place from 12 March 2015 to 14 March 2015 in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="EGX: Leftfield Collection"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.egx.net/rezzed/news/leftfield-collection-revealed | title = Leftfield Collection revealed! | date = 12 February 2015 | website = [[EGX Rezzed]] | publisher = [[Gamer Network]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the good reputation, Coffee Powered Machine submitted the game to [[Steam Greenlight]] on 12 May 2015,&lt;ref name="KS: Mob mentality" /&gt; which was eventually greenlit just six days after, namely, on 18 May 2015, to which pre-orders were opened.&lt;ref name="Steam: Greenlight"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=441596528 | title = Steam Greenlight :: Okhlos | date = 12 May 2015 | website = [[Steam Greenlight]] | publisher = [[Valve Corporation]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's growing popularity then brought the team to the third edition [[Brazil's Independent Games Festival]], which was held from 27 June 2015 until 5 July 2015 in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], where they won the "Melhor Gameplay" ("Best Gameplay") award.&lt;ref name="IGM: BIG preview" /&gt; New big news arose, as Devolver Digital announced that they had signed-up with Coffee Powered Machine for a publishing deal for ''Okhlos'', on 25 August 2015.&lt;ref name="Twitter: PAX"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/636259733133897728 | title = Devolver Digital on Twitter: "The Devolver Digital team is headed to PAX and we're bringing Enter the Gungeon, @Broforce, @GassyMob, and Okhlos!" | last = Lowire | first = Nigel | date = 25 August 2015 | website = [[Twitter]] | accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Devolver Digital]] then brought ''Okhlos'' onto the stage of [[PAX Prime]] 2015 in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="YT: Cannata" /&gt; On 25 January 2016, it was announced that the game will be released in March or April 2016,&lt;ref name="RPS: Control"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/01/26/okhlos-release-date/ | title = Control Human Swarms And Fight Giants In Okhlos | last = Graham | first = Smith | date = 26 January 2016 | website = [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] | accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was delayed to June 2016, and finally, as announced on 28 July 2016, was released on 18 August 2016.&lt;ref name="RPS: Release"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/07/28/okhlos-release-date-2/ | title = Okhlos Releases Angry Mob On August 18 | last = Warr | first = Philippa | date = 28 July 2016 | website = [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] | accessdate = 18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4873">The idea of '''polytheistic myth''' as having psychological value is one theorem of [[archetypal psychology]] as defined by [[James Hillman]], and explored in current Jungian mythology literature. [[Mythology|Myth]] itself, according to [[Joseph Campbell]], represents the human search for what is true, significant, and meaningful. He says what we are seeking is “…an experience of being alive…so that our life experiences…will have resonances within our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive”.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J. (1988). The Power of myth. New York: Doubleday p.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to proponents of this theory, [[polytheistic]] myths can provide psychological insight.

[[Christine Downing]] recounts the Greek view of the gods as energies that affect everyone. In so being they are referred to "as ''theos'', that is, as immortal, permanent, ineluctable aspects of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Downing, C. (1993). Gods in our midst: Mythological images of the masculine: A woman’s view.  New Orleans: Spring Journal Books p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes among the Greek pantheon were frequent, yet, Downing emphasizes, no god of the Classical era ever denied the existence of another god. And she cautions us as humans that to deny even one of the pantheon diminishes the richness of individuals and of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Downing, C. (1993). Gods in our midst: Mythological images of the masculine: A woman’s view.  New Orleans: Spring Journal Books p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Carl Gustav Jung]], the primary function of myth is psychological — to shed light on the workings of the unconscious. The cornerstone of his therapeutic approach is working with a patient’s dreams and fantasies. To be of help, then, it is imperative to have knowledge of the details of the patient’s life as well as knowledge of  “…symbols, and therefore of mythology and the history of religions”.&lt;ref&gt;Ellenberger, Henri F (1970). "Carl Gustav Jung and Analytical Psychology”, a chapter in The Discovery of the Unconscious: The History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry. BasicBooks, Perseus Books Groupp. p.716&lt;/ref&gt; Jung implies the diversity of [[energy (esotericism)|psychic energies]] inhabiting the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]. He also cautions us to know these energies rather than force them into one’s shadow lest one’s “…moods, nervous states, and delusions make it clear in the most painful way that [one] is not the only master in his house…"&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G. (1967). Alchemical studies. (R. F. C. Hull, Trans.). New Jersey: Princeton University Press p.37&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thomas Moore says of [[James Hillman]]’s teaching that he “portrays the psyche as inherently multiple”.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, J. (1989). A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman. Thomas Moore (Ed.). New York: Harper Collins p.36&lt;/ref&gt; In Hillman’s archetypal/polytheistic view, the psyche or soul has many directions and sources of meaning—and this can feel like an ongoing state of conflict—a struggle with one’s [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimons]]. According to Hillman, “polytheistic psychology can give sacred differentiation to our psychic turmoil…”.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, J. (1989). A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman. Thomas Moore (Ed.). New York: Harper Collins p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Hillman states that, "The power of myth, its reality, resides precisely in its power to seize and influence psychic life. The Greeks knew this so well, and so they had no depth psychology and psychopathology such as we have. They had myths. And we have no myths as such -instead, depth psychology and psychopathology. Therefore... psychology shows myths in modern dress and myths show our depth psychology in ancient dress."&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, J. (1990) ''Oedipus Variations: Studies in Literature and Psychoanalysis''. Spring p.90&lt;/ref&gt; Hillman qualifies his many references to gods as differing from a literalistic approach saying that for him they are ''aides memoires'', i.e. sounding boards employed "for echoing life today or as bass chords giving resonance to the little melodies of life."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;SPRING Journal 56, p.5 (1994) Spring Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Hillman further insists that he does not view the pantheon of gods as a 'master matrix' against which we should measure today and thereby decry modern loss of richness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  

Other proponents of this view are [[Jean Shinoda Bolen]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolen, J. (1984) ''Goddesses in Everywoman'' Harpur Perennial and (1989) ''Gods in Everyman'' Harpur Perennial&lt;/ref&gt; and Ginette Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Paris, G. (1990) ''Pagan Grace'', Spring.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rhythm section''' (also called a [[backup band]]) is a group of [[musician]]s within a [[music ensemble]] or [[band (music)|band]] who provide the underlying [[rhythm]], [[harmony]] and [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] of the accompaniment, providing a rhythmic and harmonic reference and "beat" for the rest of the band. Many of the rhythm section instruments, such as [[keyboard instrument]]s and [[guitar]]s, are used to play the [[chord progression]] upon which the [[song]] is based. The bass instrument (either [[double bass]] or [[electric bass]], or another low-register instrument, such as [[synth bass]], depending on the group and its style of music) plays the low-pitched [[bassline]] that supports the chord progression, typically by emphasizing the roots of the chords (and to a lesser degree the fifths and thirds of the chords).

The term is common in modern [[Musical ensemble|small musical ensembles]], such as bands that play [[jazz music|jazz]],&lt;ref name="HDict"&gt;Randel, Don Michael (1999). "Rhythm section" in ''The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians''; p. 560. {{ISBN|0-674-00978-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[country music|country]], [[blues]], and [[rock music|rock]]. In modern rock music, a [[rhythm guitar]]ist specializes in rhythmic and chordal playing (as opposed to the melodic [[guitar solo]]s and lead melody lines played by the [[lead guitar]]), often repeating [[quaver]] (eighth-note), half note or whole note [[chord (music)|chord]]s. In the louder genres, such as [[hard rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[punk rock]], rhythm guitarists often play [[power chord]]s with [[distortion (music)|distortion]]. Rhythm guitarists often strum [[open chord]]s in pop, rock, country and folk music and play [[barre chord]]s in many pop and rock styles.

A typical rhythm section comprises one or more [[guitar]]s (either [[electric guitar]]s, in [[rock music]] bands; [[acoustic guitar]]s, in [[country music]], [[folk music]] and [[blues]] or both electric and acoustic in some bands); and/or a [[keyboard instrument]] ([[piano]], [[electric piano]], [[Hammond organ]], [[synthesizer]], etc.) a [[double bass]] or [[electric bass]] (depending on the style of music), and [[drum kit|drums]] (usually acoustic, but in some post-1980s styles, the drums may be [[electronic drum]]s).&lt;ref name="HDict" /&gt; In some styles of music, there may be additional [[percussion instrument|percussion]]ists playing instruments such as the [[djembe]] or [[shaker (instrument)|shaker]]s. Some styles of music often have two electric guitarists, such as rock genres like [[heavy metal music]] and [[punk rock]]. Some styles of music use multiple keyboard instrument performers simultaneously (e.g., [[piano]] and [[Hammond organ]] or [[electric piano]] and [[synthesizer]]) for a fuller sound. A rhythm section could be as small as two or three instruments (e.g., a guitarist and a bassist or a [[power trio]] of bass, drums and guitar) or it may be a fairly large ensemble with several keyboardists, several guitarists, auxiliary string players ([[mandolin]], [[ukulele]], etc.), a drummer and percussionists. The largest rhythm sections may be led by a [[bandleader]] or a  [[conducting|conductor]] who indicates the [[tempo]] of each song, starts each song, leads [[ritardando|slow-downs]] of the music at [[cadence (music)|cadences]] (sections of songs where the music comes to rest on a chord), and indicates when to change soloists and how and when the song will end.

==Instruments==
The instrumentalists used in a rhythm section vary according to the style of music and era. Modern pop, rock and jazz band rhythm sections typically consist of a drummer, a bass player, and one or more players of chordal instruments (e.g., a pianist, guitarist, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drumbook.org/drum-lessons/jazz-drums/jazz-drumming/ Jazz Drum Lessons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027050049/http://www.drumbook.org/drum-lessons/jazz-drums/jazz-drumming/ |date=2010-10-27 }} - Drumbook.org&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''rhythm section'' may also refer to the [[musical instruments|instrument]]s in this group (named collectively the "rhythm section instruments").

In [[music industry]] parlance, the amplifiers and some of the instruments are nicknamed the "[[backline (stage)|backline]]." Backline instruments are commonly provided for bands at [[music festival]]s and other concerts where several bands will play during an event. By providing these backline instruments, this speeds up the changeover process when new bands take the stage. The backline typically includes large and heavy items that are hard to transport, including large [[bass amplifier]]s and [[guitar amplifier]]s and their [[speaker cabinet]]s, the [[drum kit]] (usually minus the [[cymbal]]s and the [[snare drum]], which each drummer brings from home), a [[Hammond organ]], [[stage piano]], and a [[keyboard amplifier]]. Even when a venue or festival provides a "backline", musicians must still supply some instruments themselves, such as guitars, an electric bass, and, in some cases, the cymbals and/or the snare drum. The venue informs musicians about which instruments are supplied as the backline for a specific concert or stage and in many cases, the [[contract]] signed by the band and the venue/promoter contains an explicit list of the backline gear that will be on stage, even specifying brand names and model numbers.

==Roles==
Although rhythm sections spend much of the time providing [[accompaniment]] (backing parts) for [[song]]s, in some cases, they provide other musical roles. In some songs or styles of music, instruments from the rhythm section may play soloistic roles on occasion (e.g., [[guitar solo|improvised guitar solo]]s or [[bass run|solo break]]s) or play a melodic role (e.g., a rhythm guitarist may play a lyrical [[countermelody]] behind a singer or a melodic intro line before the lead vocalist starts to sing). Since rhythm sections are generally providing the background music for lead instruments and solo singers, rhythm sections are typically not as prominent as a singer or soloist, and music fans tend to be more aware of lead singers than rhythm section members. However, since rhythm sections provide the underpinning for a good performance by the lead instruments and vocalists, good rhythm sections are valued in the [[music industry]]. Some of the most accomplished rhythm sections have become famous, such as [[The Band]], the [[E Street Band]] and [[Sly Dunbar]] and [[Robbie Shakespeare]] (the latter in [[reggae]]). As well, in some popular bands, all of the band members, including rhythm section members, have become famous as individuals (e.g., the rhythm section members of [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], etc.).

In almost all genres of [[popular music]] and [[folk music|traditional music]] that use rhythm sections, ranging from rock to country to jazz, the rhythm section members are expected to be able to [[Musical improvisation|improvise]] (make up) their parts or prepare their own parts for a given song by listening to the CD at home. Once the bassist and chord-playing instruments are provided with the [[chord progression]] on a [[lead sheet]] (in which chords are typically named using the root note of the chord and its quality; e.g., C Major, d minor, G7, etc.), they are expected to be able to improvise or prepare a [[bass line]] and chord [[voicing (music)|voicing]]s, respectively, that suit the style of the song. In each style of music, there are different musical approaches and styles that rhythm section members are expected to use. For example, in a country music song, the guitarist will be expected to be able to perform a chord progression using an intricate [[fingerpicking]] style; in a heavy metal song, the guitarist will be expected to play [[power chord]]s and complex, precise rhythmic patterns; in a [[jazz]] song, a guitarist will be expected to be able to play "jazz voicings" of the chords, which emphasize the third, seventh and often the sixth or ninth chord tones (this contrasts with the [[barre chord]] voicings used in pop and rock, which emphasize the root, fifth, and to a lesser degree, the third of the chord). Drummers and percussionists are expected to be able to improvise or prepare rhythm parts that suit the style of a given song. In some cases, an [[arrangement|arranger]], [[orchestration|orchestrator]] or [[composer]] will provide a written-out bass part or drum part written in [[music notation]] (the five-line staff in which the notes are round symbols with or without stems). It is rare in jazz or rock for chords to be written out in music notation; the arranger or songwriter typically writes the chord symbol and expects the guitarist to improvise the appropriate chord voicing.
===Other roles===
Rhythm section members may be expected to sing [[backing vocalist|backup vocals]] or [[harmony]] parts in some styles of music. In some styles of music, notably 2010s-era pop, [[hip hop music]] and funk, rhythm section members may be required to perform a rhythmic dance routine, which may range from a simple body movement to a complex [[Choreography|dance choreography]] that requires significant dance skills. In some types of [[heavy metal music]], rhythm section members (guitar, bass, drums) may be expected to be able to [[Headbanging|"headbang"]] (move their head in an up and down fashion in time with the beat) while performing. Less commonly, some rhythm section members may sing [[lead vocals]] (e.g., [[Phil Collins]] or [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]). In some groups, one rhythm section member may have other roles, such as [[bandleader]] (e.g., jazz bassist [[Charles Mingus]]), [[conducting|conductor]] (often the case in 2010s-era musical theatre shows), [[songwriter]], [[composer]] or [[arranger]].

==Components==

===Jazz===
[[File:Duke Ellington - Hurricane Ballroom - rhythm section.jpg|thumb|right |250px| Two members of [[Duke Ellington]]'s rhythm section at the Hurricane Ballroom: a jazz guitarist and an upright bass player. ]]
In the case of [[big band|swing bands]], the classic rhythm section comprises a quartet of [[electric guitar]], [[piano]], [[double bass]], and [[drum kit|drums]]; a noted example is that of the [[Count Basie Orchestra]] with [[Freddie Green]], [[Count Basie|the Count]], [[Walter Page]], and [[Jo Jones]]. Earlier jazz bands had used [[banjo]] in place of guitar, and other bass instruments such as the [[tuba]] for [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] purposes prior to the advent of [[microphone]] technology in studios.

As [[bebop]] evolved, smaller jazz groups dropped the guitar, and many [[free jazz]] ensembles dropped the piano as well. Auxiliary [[percussion instrument|percussion]] such as [[claves]], [[bongos]] or [[maracas]] can also be used, especially in music influenced by strains from [[Latin America]] such as [[salsa music|salsa]] and [[samba]]. In theory any instrument or instruments can provide a steady rhythm: for example, in the trio led by [[Jimmy Giuffre]] the late 1950s, the [[clarinet]], [[trombone|valve trombone]] and [[guitar]] all switched between lead and supporting roles.

In the 1950s, some jazz bandleaders began to replace the double bass with the then-newly invented electric bass. However, the electric bass really made a big impact on jazz in the 1970s, with the advent of jazz rock and [[jazz fusion]]. The [[electric bass]] was much easier to amplify to stadium-filling volumes using large [[bass instrument amplification|bass speaker cabinets and amplifiers]] than an upright bass. The electric bass also began to be used as an expressive solo instrument, as exemplified by the performances of [[Jaco Pastorius]] and [[Stanley Clarke]].

In the 1970s, the main chordal rhythm instruments were often electric instruments such as the [[Rhodes electric piano]] or electric clavinet, often run through [[effects unit]]s such as fuzz, phasers, or wah-wah pedals and amplified through loud [[keyboard amplifier]]s. The jazz fusion rhythm section followed the lead of the rock rhythm sections of the era, and used huge banks of speakers and powerful [[instrument amplifier|amplifiers]] to create a massive sound large enough for stadium concerts. In the later 1980s and subsequent decades, jazz fusion bands such as the [[Chick Corea Elektric Band]] used [[synthesizer]]s in the rhythm section, both for chordal [[accompaniment]] and for [[synth bass]] parts.

===R&amp;B, rock and pop===

[[File:Dni Mikołowa - Organy Hammonda1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|This Polish group's rhythm section consists of a Hammond organist, an electric bassist, and a drummer.]]
[[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] and [[rock and roll]] groups in the 1950s emphasized rhythm, so their [[backup band]]s generally consisted only of the standard swing band rhythm section of guitar, piano, bass, and drums supporting a [[singer|vocalist]], and in some cases omitting the keyboards. The [[bass guitar]] took over from the double bass in the 1950s, and had almost completely taken over the bass role in the 1960s. As the 1960s progressed the term "rhythm section" as used in a pop music context sometimes came to refer to just the bass and drums. For example, [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Ringo Starr]] of the [[Beatles]] were referred to as the band's rhythm section.

In the 1970s, [[Chord (music)|chordal]] instruments such as the electric and/or acoustic guitar and various [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] (piano, [[electric piano]], [[Hammond organ]], [[clavinet]]) continued to be used to augment the bass and drums in [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]], and [[reggae]] groups. The sound of late 1960s and 1970s rhythm sections was often given a unique tone and sound due to the use of [[effects unit]]s. Funk bass players would play through [[auto-wah]] or [[envelope follower]] pedals. Reggae guitarists would plug into echo pedals. Rock guitarists would run their electric guitars through distortion and [[wah-wah pedal|wah pedal]]s. Electric piano or clavinet players also used effects.

In the 1980s, many rock and pop bands continued to be based around the basic rock rhythm section established by 1960s and 1970s bands: electric bass, drums, and electric guitar or keyboards. In the 1980s, the first widely-affordable digital [[synthesizer]], [[Yamaha]]'s [[Yamaha DX7|DX7]], was released. The distinctive [[frequency modulation synthesis|FM synthesis]] tone of the DX7 is a key part of the sound of many 1980s pop and dance singles. 

As electronic effects became more sophisticated, with the development of [[digital signal processing]], during the 1980s, there was some crossover between the roles played by electronic keyboards and electric guitar. Even though electronic keyboards or organs were the standard instruments used to create sustained "pads" of sound (e.g., held backing chords) for ballads, with the introduction of digital delay pedals and other modern effects, electric guitars could produce similar "pads" or "[[Wall of Sound|walls of sound]]". [[The Edge]], the guitarist from the rock band [[U2]], often used digital delay and reverb-drenched electric guitar arpeggios (chords played one note after the other) to create a shimmering, sustained "pad" for the group. These arpeggio pads created a sustained sound that was similar to the sound of an electronic keyboard. By the late 1980s, the price of digital effects pedals dropped, making these effects units available to the general public.

During the 1980s era, rhythm sections in some styles of pop took an increasing turn towards [[electronic musical instrument|electronic instrument]]s. A 1980s-era dance pop band might be backed up by a rhythm section of a [[synthesizer#synth bass|synth bass]], [[electronic drum]]s (or [[drum machine]]) and various [[synthesizer]] keyboards. In some 1980s and 1990s bands, live human rhythm sections were sometimes replaced by [[Music sequencer|sequenced]] [[MIDI]] synthesizer rhythm tracks made in the studio. In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[roots rock]] scene went in the opposite direction from dance pop; roots rock favoured traditional instruments in the rhythm section such as acoustic piano, acoustic guitar, [[mandolin]], [[pedal steel guitar]], [[acoustic bass guitar]] and [[double bass|upright bass]]. Another 1980s-era trend that helped revive interest in acoustic instruments was the "[[MTV Unplugged]]" style of performances, in which a rock band performs with acoustic instruments, including acoustic guitars and an [[acoustic bass guitar]].

In rock and pop, rhythm sections range in size from the barest, stripped-down size of the "[[power trio]]" (guitarist, bassist, and drummer) and the [[organ trio]] (Hammond organist, drummer, and a third instrument) to large rhythm sections with several stringed instrument players (mandolin, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, etc.), multiple keyboard players (e.g., piano, Hammond organ, electric piano, synth), two instruments playing a bass role (e.g., bass guitar and synth bass) and a group of auxiliary percussionists (congas, shakers, etc.) to fill out (or "sweeten") the sound. Some rhythm sections combine electronic/digital instruments that are sequenced, pre-recorded [[backing track|backup track]]s and live instruments (including electric, electronic and acoustic instruments).

==Musical roles==
[[File:William Parker &amp; Rashid Bakr.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Jazz is one of the styles that often features rhythm section members on solos.]]
The drums and bass both supply a rhythmic [[Beat (music)|pulse]] for the music, and the bass instrument supplies a [[harmony (music)|harmonic]] foundation with a [[bassline]]. The types of basslines performed by the bass guitarist vary widely from one style of music to another. Despite all of the differences in the styles of bassline in most styles of popular music, the bass guitarist fulfills a similar role: anchoring the harmonic framework (often by emphasizing the roots of the chord progression) and laying down the beat (in collaboration with the drummer). The importance of the bass guitarist and the bass line varies in different styles of music. In some pop styles, such as 1980s-era pop and musical theater, the bass sometimes plays a relatively simple part, and the music forefronts the vocals and melody instruments. In contrast, in [[reggae]] or funk, entire songs may be centered around the bass groove, and the bassline is very prominent in the mix.

Similarly, the role of the drummer varies a great deal from one style of music to another. In some types of music, such as traditional 1950s-style country music, the drummer has a rudimentary "timekeeping" role, and the drums are placed low in the mix by the sound engineers. In styles such as [[progressive rock]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], and [[jazz fusion]], the drummers often perform complex, challenging parts, and the drums may be given a prominent placement in the mix; as well, the drummer may be often given prominent solo breaks, fills, or introductions that put the spotlight on their technical skills and musicality. In the more experimental forms of [[free jazz]] and jazz fusion, the drummer may not play the strict "timekeeping" role that is associated with drums in pop music. Instead, the drums may be used more to create textured polyrhythmic soundscapes. In this type of situation, the main pulse is often provided by the bass player rather than the drummer.

The rhythm section members sometimes break out of their accompaniment role when they are asked to perform keyboard solos, [[bass run|bass break]]s, or drum solos. In genres such as [[progressive rock]], [[art rock]], or [[progressive metal]], the rhythm section members may play complicated parts along with the [[lead guitar]] (or vocalist) and perform extended solos. In [[jazz]] groups and [[jazz fusion]] bands, the rhythm section members are often called on to perform [[improvisation|improvised]] solos. In jazz, the drummer may "trade" short solo sections with a [[saxophone]] player or trumpet player; this practice, nicknamed "trading fours", typically involves the drummer and the horn player alternating four bar solo sections during a jazz tune. They can also trade eights, twos, ones, or other numbers depending on the musical context.

==Variants==

===Organ trios===
In [[organ trio]]s, the lower [[octave]]s of a [[Hammond organ]] or [[electronic keyboard]] are used as a substitute for bass guitar or double bass. The organist can play the bassline using the bass [[pedal keyboard]] or using the lower manual. As well, the organist could play right-hand chords and melodies. Organ trios were a widely used type of jazz ensemble in the 1950s and 1960s to play [[hard bop]].

Organ trios are sometimes used in rock as well. [[The Doors]]' [[keyboardist]] [[Ray Manzarek]] used a [[keyboard bass]] to play the bass lines. Manzarek, guitarist [[Robby Krieger]], and drummer [[John Densmore]] would act as an organ trio with the addition of singer [[Jim Morrison]].

===Dixieland bands===
[[File:PalmCourt15Sept07RhythmSectionB.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dixieland band rhythm sections sometimes use a tuba for the bassline.]]
[[New Orleans]]  or [[Dixieland]] jazz bands occasionally use [[tuba]], sousaphone, or bass saxophone in place of the [[double bass]] that was common in 1920s-era jazz bands. This tradition developed from the origins of New Orleans music in marching bands, which used instruments that could be carried on harnesses or with straps. Marching bands use a mixture of brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments, because all of these instruments can be played while marching.

==Other variants==
Not all rhythm sections follow the standard model of drummer-bassist-chordal instrument. Some bands have no drummer. In bands without a drummer, one or more instruments from the rhythm section often play in styles that replace the drum kit role—that is laying down the beat and [[beat (music)|backbeat]]. Traditional bluegrass bands typically do not have a drummer. In bluegrass bands, the timekeeping role is shared between several instruments: the upright bass generally plays the on-beats while the mandolin plays [[chop chord]]s on the off-beats, with the banjo also keeping a steady eighth note rhythm.

This distributed nature allows for rhythmic continuity while players take turns highlighting the melody. In funk-oriented groups that do not have a drummer, the electric bass player may take over some of the drummer's role by using slap bass. With slap bass, the bassist slaps the low strings to create a strong "thump" (similar to the bass drum's role) and "snaps" or "pops" the high strings to create a percussive effect (the latter takes over some of the role played by the hi-hat cymbals). In some bands, there may be no bass player—the basslines may be played by the piano player, synth player, or guitarist. Using a guitar player to provide basslines is particularly effective if a guitar player has a seven-string guitar with a low "B" string. 

Some jazz duos consist of a [[singer]] [[accompaniment|accompanied]] by a single piano player. In these duos, the [[jazz piano]] player has a challenging task; she has to provide all of the rhythmic and harmonic foundation that would normally be provided by a full rhythm section. A jazz pianist accompanying a singer in a duo needs to play, all at the same time, a deep [[bassline]], [[chord (music)|chords]], and [[fill (music)|fill-in melody lines]] while the singer is performing. As well, the pianist often [[jazz improvisation|improvises]] an instrumental solo in between her vocal melodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9406">A '''script''' is a document describing the narrative and dialogue of a [[comic book]] in detail. It is the comic book equivalent of a [[Television|television program]] [[teleplay]] or a [[film]] [[screenplay]].

In comics, a script may be preceded by a plot outline, and is almost always followed by page sketches, drawn by a [[comics artist]] and [[inker|inked]], succeeded by the [[colorist|coloring]] and [[letterer|lettering]] stages. There are no prescribed forms of comic scripts, but there are two dominant styles in the mainstream comics industry, the ''full script'' (commonly known as "[[DC Comics|DC]] style") and the ''plot script'' (or "[[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] style").&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;Jones, Steven Philip.

M. Keith Booker (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Comic Books and Graphic Novels'', Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2010, p. 172: "[[William Erwin Eisner]] was a comic book creator, graphic novelist, teacher, entrepreneur, and advocate of comics."&lt;/ref&gt;) breaks the story down in sequence, page-by-page and panel-by-panel, describing the action, characters, and sometimes backgrounds and "camera" points-of-view of each panel, as well as all captions and dialogue balloons. For decades, this was the preferred format for books published by [[DC Comics]].

[[Peter David]] described his specific application of the full script method: "I break down each page on a panel by panel basis and label them as PANEL A, PANEL B, and so on. Then I describe what's in each panel, and then do the dialogue, numbering the balloons. I designate the panels with letters and the word balloons with numbers so as to minimize confusion for the letterer."&lt;ref&gt;[[David, Peter]].

==Plot script&lt;!--'Marvel Method', 'Marvel method' and 'Marvel house style' redirect here--&gt;==
In a plot script the artist works from a story synopsis from the writer (or plotter), rather than a full script. The artist creates page-by-page plot details on his or her own, after which the work is returned to the writer for the insertion of dialogue. Due to its widespread use at [[Marvel Comics]] beginning in the 1960s, primarily under writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]], this approach became commonly known as the Marvel method or Marvel house style.&lt;ref name=TCJ75&gt;Groth, Gary. "Editorial," ''The Comics Journal'' #75 (Sept. 1982), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comics historian [[Mark Evanier]] writes that this "new means of collaboration . . . was born of necessity&amp;mdash;Stan was overburdened with work&amp;mdash;and to make use of Jack's great skill with storylines. . . . Sometimes Stan would type up a written plot outline for the artist. Sometimes, not."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Evanier|Evanier, Mark]]. ''Kirby: King of Comics'' ([[Harry N. Abrams]], New York, 2008), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; As comic-book writer-editor [[Dennis O'Neil]] describes, the Marvel method ". . . requires the writer to begin by writing out a plot and add[ing] words when the penciled artwork is finished. . . .[I]n the mid-sixties, plots were seldom more than a typewritten page, and sometimes less," while writers in later times "might produce as many as twenty-five pages of plot for a twenty-two page story, and even include in them snatches of dialog. So a Marvel Method plot can run from a couple of paragraphs to something much longer and more elaborate."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]]. "Write Ways: An Unruly Anti-Treatise", chapter in Dooley, Michael, and Steven Heller, eds., ''The Education of a Comics Artist: Visual Narrative in Cartoons, Graphic Novels, and Beyond'' (Allworth Communications, 2005, {{ISBN|1-58115-408-9}}); p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marvel method was in place with at least one artist by early 1961, as Lee described in 2009 when speaking of his and Ditko's "short, five-page filler strips ... placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill", most prominently in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' but even previously in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' and other "[[Atlas Comics (1950s)#Pre-superhero Marvel|pre-superhero Marvel]]" [[science-fiction]]/[[fantasy]] anthology titles. "I'd dream up odd fantasy tales with an [[O. Henry]] type twist ending. All I had to do was give Steve a one-line description of the plot and he'd be off and running. He'd take those skeleton outlines I had given him and turn them into classic little works of art that ended up being far cooler than I had any right to expect."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]], "Introduction", in Yoe Craig, ''The Art of Ditko'' ([[IDW Publishing|Idea &amp; Design Works]], January 2010), {{ISBN|1-60010-542-4}}, {{ISBN|978-1-60010-542-5}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The October 2018 issue of DC Comics' in-house previews magazine, ''DC Nation'', featured a look at the creative process that writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artists [[Ryan Sook]], [[Wade von Grawbadger]] and Brad Anderson employed on ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1004, which included pages of Bendis' script that were broken down panel by panel, albeit without dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;"Breaking Down a Page", ''DC Nation'' #5 (December 2018), pp 6-7. DC Comics ([[Burbank, California]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of the Marvel method over the full script method that have been cited by creators and industry professionals include (1) the artist is more visually-minded and thus often has a better notion of how a scene should play out, (2) it gives the artist more freedom,&lt;ref name="FieldShad"&gt;{{cite book |last=Field |first=Tom |authorlink= |title=Secrets in the Shadows: The Art &amp; Life of Gene Colan |url= |year=2005 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |isbn= |page= 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Cordier|first= Philippe|date= April 2007|title = Seeing Red: Dissecting Daredevil's Defining Years|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue= 21|pages= 33–60|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (3) it lightens the burden on the writer.&lt;ref name="FieldShad"/&gt; Cited disadvantages include (1) not all talented artists are talented writers, and some struggle over aspects such as plot ideas and pacing,&lt;ref name="FieldShad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Back17"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Cassell|first= Dewey|date= August 2006|title= Talking About Tigra: From the Cat to Were-Woman|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 17|pages= 30|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) it takes advantage of artists, who are typically paid for art alone even though they are essentially working as co-writers,&lt;ref name="Back17"/&gt; and (3) the artist's development of a story may clash with the writer's style.

===Kurtzman style===
In a variation of the plot script, attributed to [[Harvey Kurtzman]], the writer breaks down the story into page roughs or thumbnail sketches, with captions and dialogue jotted down inside the roughs. The artist (who is often the comic's writer as well) then fleshes out the roughs onto full-size art board. Writer/artists [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] favor this style, as did [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]].&lt;ref name="jones" /&gt;

===EC style===
Attributed to [[William Gaines]] (Kurtzman’s publisher at [[EC Comics]]), the EC style is similar to the Kurtzman Style, except the writer submits a tight plot to an artist, who breaks it down into panels that are laid out on the art board. The writer writes all captions and dialogue, which are pasted inside these panels, and then the artist draws the story to fit all of this paste-up. This laborious and restrictive way of creating comics is no longer in general use; the last artist to use even a variation of EC style was the late [[Jim Aparo]].&lt;ref name="jones" /&gt;

'''''Sexcetera''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American television series]] airing on [[Playboy TV]]. Formatted as a [[News magazine#Broadcast news magazines|newsmagazine]], the program focused on [[human sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/68449650.html?dids=68449650:68449650&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+20%2C+1998&amp;author=DON+KAPLAN&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;desc=OH+BABY!+HERE'S+%22SEX-TY+MINUTES'+%3B+PLAYBOY+LAUNCHES+NEWS+YOU+PROBABLY+WON'T+USE&amp;pqatl=google |title=Archives - New York Post Online Edition |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1998-10-20 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sexcetera'' is repeated from time to time on [[Real Lives (TV channel)|Real Lives]] and [[Pick (TV channel)|Pick]] in the United Kingdom, RTL 7 in the Netherlands, TV5 in Finland and [[AXN]] in Italy.

Launched in 1998, ''Sexcetera'' ran for more than 80 [[episode]]s. By the time the program went off the air in 2005, it had become one of Playboy TV's longest-running shows.

The show featured four to five [[report]]s per one-hour episode. Filmed throughout the [[United States]] and in  [[Europe]], the reports generally covered [[Sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]], [[adult entertainment]] [[Trade fair|expos]] and gatherings, current [[erotic]] trends, [[sex toy]]s, porn celebrities and tips for couples.

[[Correspondents]] presented their stories in a [[humorous]] style; female correspondents often appeared in the nude. As befitting its subject matter, the series is sexually explicit, with unsimulated sexual activity shown from time to time, with increasing explicitness as the series went on.

'''Shadow play''', also known as '''shadow puppetry''', is an ancient form of [[storytelling]] and [[entertainment]] which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen or [[scrim (material)|scrim]]. The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented [[puppeteer]] can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.

Shadow play is popular in various cultures, among both children and adults in many countries around the world. More than 20 countries are known to have shadow show troupes. Shadow play is an old tradition and it has a long history in Southeast Asia, especially in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]]. It has been an ancient art and a living folk tradition in [[China]], [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. It is also known in [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Germany]], [[France]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=orr69/&gt;&lt;ref name=bosnes302&gt;{{cite book|author=Beth Osnes|title=Acting: An International Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTkCI62oXjEC&amp;pg=PA335 |year=2001| publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn= 978-0-87436-795-9|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beth Osnes|title=The Shadow Puppet Theatre of Malaysia: A Study of Wayang Kulit with Performance Scripts and Puppet Designs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ykQlV616gX4C |year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5792-2|pages=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Shadow play probably developed from "par" shows with narrative scenes painted on a large cloth and the story further related through song. As the shows were mostly performed at night the par was illuminated with an oil lamp. Shadow puppet theatre likely originated in Central Asia-China or in India in the 1st millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=chen25&gt;Fan Pen Chen (2003), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1179080 Shadow Theaters of the World], Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 62, No. 1 (2003), pp. 25-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orr69&gt;{{cite journal | last=Orr | first=Inge C. | title=Puppet Theatre in Asia | journal=Asian Folklore Studies | publisher=Nanzan University | volume=33 | issue=1 | year=1974 | doi=10.2307/1177504 | pages=69–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; By at least around 200 BCE the figures on cloth seem to have been replaced with puppetry in Indian "tholu bomalatta" shows. These are performed behind a thin screen with flat, jointed puppets made of colorfully painted transparent leather. The puppets are held close to the screen and lit from behind, while hands and arms are manipulated with attached canes and lower legs swinging freely from the knee.

The evidence of shadow puppet theatre is found in both ancient Chinese and Indian texts.

According to Martin Banham, there is little mention of indigenous theatrical activity in the Middle East between the 3rd century CE and the 13th-century, including the centuries that followed the Islamic conquest of the region.&lt;ref name="Banham1996p241"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Banham|title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ubr35UeE-UQC&amp;pg=PA241|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44654-9|pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shadow puppet play, states Banham, probably came into vogue in the Middle East after the Mongol invasions and thereafter it incorporated local innovations by the 16th-century. Little mention of shadow play is found in Islamic literature of Iran, but much is found in Turkish and 19th-century Ottoman Empire influenced territories.&lt;ref name="Banham1996p241"/&gt;

===Prelude to cinematography===
According to Stephen Herbert, the popular shadow theatre evolved nonlinearly into projected slides and ultimately into [[cinematography]]. The common principle in these innovations were the creative use of light, images and a projection screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Herbert|title=A History of Pre-cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwg_dav1IpcC|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-21148-2|pages=iv–ix, Introduction chapter}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Olive Cook, there are many parallels in the development of shadow play and modern cinema, such as their use of music, voice, attempts to introduce colors and mass popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Olive Cook (1963), [https://archive.org/details/movementintwodim00cook Movement in Two Dimensions], Hutchinson, pages 47-58&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tholu Pava Koothu'' performance of Kerala uses leather puppets whose images are projected on backlit screen.

''[[Wayang kulit]]'', a style of Wayang shadow play, is particularly popular in [[Java]] and [[Bali]]. The term derived from the word ''wayang'' literally means ''shadow'' or imagination in [[Javanese language|Javanese]], also connotes "spirit". The word ''kulit'' means skin, as the material from which the puppet is made is thin perforated leather sheets made from buffalo skin.

The performances of shadow puppet theater in Bali is typically at night, lasting until dawn.&lt;ref name=britwayang/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubin2001p184"/&gt; The complete ''wayang kulit'' troupes include ''dalang'' (puppet master), ''nayaga'' ([[gamelan]] players), and ''sinden'' (female choral singer). Some of the ''nayaga'' also performed as male choral singer. The ''dalang'' (puppet master) play/ed the wayang behind the cotton screen illuminated by oil lamp or modern halogen lamp, creating visual effects similar to animation. The flat puppet has moveable joints that are animated by hand, using rods connected to the puppet. The handle of the rod is made of carved buffalo horn. On November 7, 2003, [[UNESCO]] designated ''wayang kulit'' from Indonesia as one of the ''[[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]''.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title="Wayang puppet theatre", Inscribed in 2008 (3.COM) on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (originally proclaimed in 2003) |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00063 |publisher= UNESCO |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadow theatre in [[Thailand]] is called ''[[Nang yai]]''; in the south there is a tradition called ''[[Nang Talung]]''. Nang Yai puppets are normally made of [[cowhide]] and [[rattan]]. Performances are normally accompanied by a combination of [[song]]s and [[chant]]s. Performances in Thailand were temporarily suspended in 1960 due to a fire at the national theatre.

In [[Malaysia]], shadow puppet plays are also known as ''[[wayang kulit]]''. In both [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]], ''Wayang'' means shadow or imagination, while ''Kulit'' means skin and refers to the leather that puppets are made from. Stories presented are usually [[mythology|mythical]] and morality tales. There is an educational moral to the plays which usually portray a battle between Malay shadow plays are sometimes considered one of the earliest examples of [[animation]]. The wayang kulit in northern states of Malaysia such as [[Kelantan]] is influenced and similar to Thai shadow puppets, while the wayang kulit in southern Malay peninsula, especially in [[Johor]] is brought from [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] [[Indonesian culture|Indonesian]] wayang kulit with slightly different on the story and performance.

The puppets are made primarily of [[leather]] and manipulated with sticks or [[domestic buffalo|buffalo]] horn handles. Shadows are cast using an [[oil lamp]] or, in modern times, a halogen light, onto a [[cotton]] cloth background. They are often associated with [[gamelan]] music.

There are several myths and legends about the origins of shadow puppetry in China. The most famous one has it that Chinese shadow puppetry originated when the favorite [[concubine]] of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (156 BCE – 87 BCE) died and magician Shao-weng promised to raise her spirit. The emperor could see a shadow that looked like her move behind the curtains that the magician had placed around some lit torches. It is often told that the magician used a shadow puppet, but the original text in ''[[Book of Han]]'' gives no reason to believe in a relation to shadow puppetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZu9Cje8TfkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=shadow%20theatre%20history&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Chinese Shadow Theatre: History, Popular Religion, and Women Warriors|author=Fan Pen Li Chen|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many earlier records of all kinds of puppetry in China, clear mention of Chinese shadow play does not occur until the [[Northern Song]] dynasty (960–1127). A 1235 book mentions that the puppets were initially cut out of paper, but later made of colored leather or parchment. The stories were mostly based on history and half fact half fiction, but comedies were also performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dolby |first1=William |title=The Origins of Chinese Puppetry |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |date=1978 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=97–120 |jstor=615625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadow theatre became quite popular as early as the [[Song Dynasty]] when holidays were marked by the presentation of many shadow plays. During the [[Ming Dynasty]] there were 40 to 50 shadow show [[wiktionary:troupe|troupe]]s in the city of [[Beijing]] alone.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The earliest shadow theatre screens were made of [[Rice paper|mulberry paper]].

Chinese shadow puppetry is shown in the 1994 [[Zhang Yimou]] film ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]''.

===Taiwan Ping===
The origins of [[Taiwan]]'s shadow puppetry can be traced to the [[Chaozhou|Chaochow]] school of shadow puppet theatre. Commonly known as leather monkey shows or leather shows, the shadow plays were popular in [[Tainan City|Tainan]], [[Kaohsiung]], and [[Pingtung City|Pingtung]] as early as the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1911 A.D.). Older puppeteers estimate that there were at least a hundred shadow puppet troupes in southern Taiwan in the closing years of the Qing. Traditionally, the eight to 12-inch puppet figures, and the stage scenery and props such as furniture, natural scenery, pagodas, halls, and plants are all cut from leather. As shadow puppetry is based on light penetrating through a translucent sheet of cloth, the "shadows" are actually silhouettes seen by the audience in profile or face on. Taiwan's shadow plays are accompanied by Chaochow melodies which are often called "priest's melodies" owing to their similarity with the music used by Taoist priests at funerals. A large repertoire of some 300 scripts of the southern school of drama used in shadow puppetry and dating back to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries has been preserved in Taiwan and is considered to be a priceless cultural asset.

===Terminology===
A number of terms are used to describe the different forms.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

* 皮影戏, píyĭngxì is a shadow theatre using leather puppets. The figures are usually moved behind a thin screen and is not entirely a show of shadows as it is more of a silhouette shadow. This gives the figures some color, and is not 100% black and white.
* 纸影戏, zhĭyĭngxì is paper shadow theatre.
* 中国影戏, Zhōngguó yĭngxì is Chinese shadow theatre.

==Ottoman Empire==
[[File:Karagoz figures.jpg|thumb|Shadow play Karagöz puppets from Turkey]]
A more bawdy comedy tradition of shadow play was widespread throughout the [[Ottoman Empire]], possibly since the late 14th century. It was centered around the contrasting interaction between the figures [[Karagöz and Hacivat]]: an unprincipled peasant and his fussy, educated companion. Together with other characters they represented all the major ethnic and social groups in Ottoman culture.&lt;ref&gt;Emin Şenyer: [http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm Karagoz Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Schneider | first= Irene |pages= 193 | chapter= Ebussuud |editor= Michael Stolleis (ed.) |title= Juristen: ein biographisches Lexikon; von der Antike bis zum 20. Jahrhundert |edition= 2nd |year= 2001 |publisher= Beck |location= München |language= German |isbn= 3-406-45957-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was usually performed by a single puppet master, who voiced up to dozens of characters, and could be assisted by an apprentice handing him the puppets. The show could be introduced by a singer, accompanied by a tambourine player.&lt;ref name=Alok/&gt; Its origins are obscure, though probably deriving from an Asian source.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Karagöz theatre puppets have jointed limbs and are made from camel or buffalo hide. The hide is made transparent and colored, resulting in colorful projections. Puppets are typically 35–40 centimeters in height.&lt;ref name=Alok&gt;Ersin Alok, "Karagöz-Hacivat: The Turkish Shadow Play", ''Skylife - Şubat'' ([[Turkish Airlines]] inflight magazine), February 1996, p. 66–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century these characters were adapted to the Greek language and culture, ''Karagöz and Hacivat'' becoming [[Karagiozis]] and [[Hadjiavatis]] with each of the characters assuming stereotypically Greek personalities. This tradition thrived throughout [[Greece]] after independence as popular entertainment for a largely adult audience, particularly before competition arose from television. The stories did, however, retain the period setting in the late years of the Ottoman Empire. Karagiozis theatre has undergone some revival in recent years, with the intended audience tending to be largely juvenile.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Karagöz theatre was also adapted in Egypt and North Africa.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1&gt;David Robinson in ''Light and Movement", Chapter 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
Via Italy the shadow theatre spread throughout Europe at the end of the 17th century. It is known that several Italian showmen performed in Germany, France and England during this period.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;
In 1675 German polymath and philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] imagined a kind of world exhibition that would show all kinds of new inventions and spectacles. In a handwritten document he supposed it should include shadow theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://www.academia.edu/379115/Leibniz_and_the_Lantern|title=Leibniz and the Lantern|first=Deac|last=Rossell|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication |url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Dr%C3%B4le_de_Pens%C3%A9e,_touchant_une_nouvelle_sorte_de_repr%C3%A9sentations|year=1675|title=Drôle de Pensée, touchant une nouvelle sorte de représentations|author1=Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz |accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French missionaries had taken the shadow show from China to [[France]] in 1767 and put on performances in [[Paris]] and [[Marseilles]], causing quite a stir.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In time, the ''Ombres chinoises'' ([[French language|French]] for "Chinese Shadows") with local modification and embellishment, became the ''Ombres françaises'' and struck root in the country.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The popularity of Ombres chinoises reflected the [[chinoiserie]] fashion of the days.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;

French showman [[François Dominique Séraphin]] first presented his shadow spectacle in a [[hôtel particulier]] in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] in 1771. He would go on to perform at the [[Palace of Versailles]] in front of royalty. In 1784 Séraphin moved to Paris, performing his shows at his permanent theatre in the newly opened [[Palais-Royal]] from 8 September 1784. The performances would adapt to the political changes and survived the [[French Revolution]]. Séraphin developed the use of [[clockwork]] mechanisms to automate the show. His nephew took over the show after Séraphin's death in 1800 and it was continued by his heirs until the theatre closed in 1870.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Altick"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Shows of London|first=Richard Daniel|last=Altick|date=January 1978|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674807310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pupazzi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/lespupazzinoirso00lemeuoft/lespupazzinoirso00lemeuoft_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Les pupazzi noirs"|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stafford"&gt;{{cite book|title=Devices of Wonder: From the World in a Box to Images on a Screen|first1=Barbara|last1=Stafford|first2=Frances|last2=Terpak|publisher=Getty Research Institute, U.S|date=1 February 2002|isbn=978-0892365906|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1775 Ambrogio (also known as Ambroise and Ambrose) staged ambitious shows in Paris and London.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;

[[File:Théatre d'Ombres in Le Chat Noir.jpg|thumb|Stagehands moving zinc figures behind the screen of the Théatre d'Ombres in Le Chat Noir]]
The art was a popular entertainment in Paris during the 19th century, especially in the famous Paris nightclub district of [[Montmartre]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The cabaret [[Le Chat noir]] ("The Black Cat") produced 45&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/in-the-musee-dorsay/exhibitions-in-the-musee-dorsay/article/le-cabaret-du-chat-noir-1881-1897-6768.html?cHash=2525e3a5cd|title=Musée d'Orsay: Le Cabaret du Chat Noir (1881-1897)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Théatre d'ombres'' shows between 1885 and 1896 under the management of [[Rodolphe Salis]]. Behind a screen on the second floor of the establishment, the artist [[Henri Rivière (painter)|Henri Rivière]] worked with up to 20 assistants in a large, [[oxy-hydrogen]] back-lit performance area and used a double optical [[Magic lantern|lantern]] to project backgrounds. Figures were originally cardboard cut-outs, but were replaced with zinc figures since 1887. Various artists took part in the creation, including [[Steinlen]], [[Adolphe Willette]] and [[Albert Robida]]. [[Caran d'Ache]] designed circa 50 cut-outs for the very popular 1888 show ''L'Epopée''. [[Musée d'Orsay]] has circa 40 original zinc figures in its collection. Other cabarets would produce their own versions and the ''Ombres'' evolved into numerous theatrical productions and had a major influence on [[phantasmagoria]].&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Spirit of Montmartre: Cabarets, Humour and the Avant-Garde, 1875-1905''. edited by Phillip Dennis Cate and Mary Shaw (1996) &lt;!--Publisher?--&gt;, excerpted on line as [http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/RIVIERE.html Henri Riviere: Le Chat noir and 'Shadow Theatre'], [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/decorative-arts/commentaire_id/infantry-mounting-an-assault-17678.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=846&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=843&amp;cHash=922d5c2b6f |title=Musée d'Orsay - Works in focus: Infantry mounting an assault}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montmartre-secret.com/article-montmartre-le-cabaret-du-chat-noir-2-rue-victor-masse-salis-69278723.html|title=montmartre-secret.com - Montmartre: Le cabaret du Chat Noir (2) rue Victor Massé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ombra francese seconda.jpg|thumb|right|alt=French shadow puppets|Part of the collection of the Museo del PRECINEMA, Padua, Italy]]
In Italy, the [[Museum of Precinema]] collezione Minici Zotti in [[Padua]] houses a collection of 70 French shadow puppets, similar to those used in the cabaret Le Chat Noir, together with an original theatre and painted backdrops, as well as two magic lanterns for projecting scenes. So far, the shadow plays identified are ''La Marche a l'étoile'' (introduced by Henri Rivière), ''Le Sphinx'' (introduced by Amédée Vignola), ''L'Âge d'or'' and ''Le Carneval de Venise'', and it is supposed that the shadow puppets were created for a tour in France or abroad at the end of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Nowadays, several theatre companies in France are developing the practice of shadow puppets: Le Théâtre des Ombres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theatredesombres.free.fr/|title=Theatre des Ombres : une compagnie spécialisée dans le théâtre d'ombreset les ombres chinoises, la réalisation de spectacles d'ombres, lesreprésentations de spectacles d'ombre chinoise, atelier et spectacle de théâtre d'ombre, stage de theatre d'ombres, shadow puppets, shadows show, shadowtheater|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Théâtre du Petit Miroir, Le Théâtre Les Chaises, and La Loupiote.

==Australia==
[[Richard Bradshaw (puppeteer)|Richard Bradshaw]] is a famous Australian shadow puppeteer. His character ''Super Kangaroo'' is just one in his varied repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, D, ''Puppetry'', p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The skill of Bradshaw has been featured in television programs made by [[Jim Henson]].

The Shadow Theatre of Anaphoria&lt;ref&gt;[http://anaphoria.com/shadow.html The Shadow Theatre of Anaphoria]&lt;/ref&gt; (relocated to Australia from California) combines a mixture of reconstructed and original puppets with multiple sources of lights. The company is under the direction of [[Kraig Grady]].

Australian Indie Company ''Shadowplay Studios''' debut game ''Projection: First Light'' is inspired classic by shadow puppetry and its art style replicates the tradition shadow play canvas using black props and sepia backgrounds. They visited Richard Bradshaw to gain more insight into shadow puppetry to make their game more authentic by getting references for creating the games shadow puppet characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projection: First Light – An Interview with Michael Chu|url=https://puppetplace.wordpress.com/2018/02/13/projection-first-light-an-interview-with-michael-chu/|website=Puppet Place News|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shadow puppetry today==

[[File:Karagoz theatre 06315.JPG|Shadow [[puppeteer]], 2006|thumb]]

In the 1910s the [[Germany|German]] animator [[Lotte Reiniger]] pioneered [[silhouette animation]] as a format, whereby shadow-play-like puppets are filmed [[stop motion|frame-by-frame]]. This technique has been kept alive by subsequent animators and is still practised today, though [[Traditional animation|cel animation]] and [[computer animation]] has also been used to imitate the look of shadow play and silhouette animation. Traditional Chinese shadow puppetry was brought to audiences in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s through the efforts of [[Pauline Benton]]. Contemporary artists such as [[Annie Katsura Rollins]] have perpetuated the medium, sometimes combining the form with Western theatre.&lt;ref name="Shadow Woman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayter-Menzies|first=Grant|title=Shadow Woman: The Extraordinary Career of Pauline Benton|date=2013|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=978-0-7735-8909-4|pages=158–159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=He9sAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=%22Annie%20Katsura%20Rollins%22&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadow theatre itself is still popular in many parts of Asia. [[Prahlad Acharya]] is one famous [[India]]n magician who incorporates it into his performances.

In the 2010s, performer Tom McDonagh introduced [[Stereoscopy|3-D]] shadow puppets and use of laser-cut objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencefriday.com/video/08/02/2013/dark-art.html|title=Dark Art|work=Science Friday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also appears occasionally in [[Western culture|western]] [[popular culture]], for example in:
*The children's television show ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]''
*The [[1983 in film|1983]] film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'', opens with a scene from an Indonesian [[Wayang]] shadow play
*The 2004 video game ''[[Sudeki]]'' opens with a shadow puppet play setting the stage for the game.
*The [[Center for Puppetry Arts]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] has an extensive variety of Chinese shadow puppets in their Asian collection.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Publication history==
Writer-artist Frank Miller rose to fame within the American comics industry with his 1981–1983 work on [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'', and the 1986 [[DC Comics]] miniseries ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', both of which  exhibited subtle elements of [[film noir]].&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance&gt;{{cite web | last=Sims | first=Chris | date=May 26, 2011 | url=http://comicsalliance.com/best-noir-comics/ | title=8 of the Best Noir Comics: Crime Does Pay | publisher=[[Comics Alliance]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's venture into the film noir genre would deepen with his creator-owned series ''Sin City'', which began publishing in serialized form in the [[Dark Horse Comics]] anthology series ''[[Dark Horse Presents]]'' #51–62. The story was released in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], and later re-released in 1995 under the name ''[[Sin City: The Hard Goodbye]]''.

In a 2016 interview with the [[Kubert School]], Miller explained his inspiration for ''Sin City'' thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've been a fanatic for a long time for old crime movies and old crime novels. But it started with the movies. And the old [[James Cagney|Cagney]] movies. [[Humphrey Bogart|Bogart]] and all that. I loved just how the morals of the stories are. They're all about right and wrong. But in ''Sin City'' in particular I wanted them all to happen to in a world where virtuous behavior was rare, which greatly resembled the world I lived in. It's kinda like the old [[Sympathy for the Devil|Rolling Stones song]], where every cop's a criminal, and all the sinners are saints, where the lowlifes would often be heroic, and the most stridently beautiful and sweet women would be prostitutes. I wanted it to be a world out of balance, where virtue is defined by individuals in difficult situations, not by an overwhelming sense of goodness that was somehow governed by this godlike [[Comics Code]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo7frKC0N2E&amp;t=2431s "Frank Miller Full Video"].

Miller's ''Sin City'' work challenges some conventions of comic book form. The letters of [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] words like "blam" are often incorporated into scenes via lighting effects, or are suggested by the negative space between panels, or are created by the outline of the panels themselves. This is especially evident in early "yarns," such as ''The Hard Goodbye'', which were more experimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnott|first=Luke|title=BLAM!

==Setting==
[[File:Hard Goodbye.png|left|thumb|An example of Frank Miller's use of high contrasts in ''Sin City'']]
Basin City, almost universally referred to by the nickname "Sin City", is a fictional town in the American west.  The climate is hot and arid, although Sacred Oaks{{clarify|date=August 2014}} is characterized as being heavily wooded.  A major river runs through the city, which has an extensive waterfront. Usually twice a year, a major downpour comes, and the city is prone to heavy snowfall in the winter. Desert lizards and palm trees are common, while tar pits, desert areas, mountain ranges and flat farmland make up the landscape around the city.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Basin City Police Department are more or less along the lines of paramilitary or [[SWAT]], as they have to deal with incredibly high crime rates among criminals and civilians alike, which is why they have access to what most would consider "heavy weaponry" and full body armor.  Those who make up the force have been described as commonly being lazy, cowardly and/or corrupt.  Only a handful of the cops are honest, though frequently the wealthy of the city bribe the corrupt members of the police into performing their duty (usually as a result of some crime being committed or threatened against a member of their family)(Miller, 1991).

During the [[California Gold Rush]], the [[Roark family]] "imported" a large number of attractive women to keep the miners happy, making a fortune and turning a struggling mining camp into a thriving, bustling city.  Over the years, as the Roark family migrated into other areas of business and power, these women ended up forming the district of Old Town, the [[prostitute]] quarter of the city where they rule with absolute authority.  In addition, the people charged with governing the city, most of them from the Roark line, remained in power for generations, running it as they saw fit.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} (Miller, 1991).

As the various yarns progress, the audience gradually becomes familiar with key locations in and around Basin City:

*'''The Projects''', the run-down and poor side of Sin City, are a tangle of high-rise run-down and desolated apartments where crime runs rampant with no police inside.  Its inhabitants have apparently evolved their own independent society with almost no legal contact with the outside world and SWAT teams rarely go in The Projects. Marv was born in the Projects, and currently resides there. Dwight avoids The Projects and hates the neighborhood.
*'''The Docks''', a collection of wharfs and warehouses that are local to the Projects, since The Docks overlook The Projects.  Hartigan and Roark Junior have their first confrontation here in ''That Yellow Bastard'', and Marv drives a stolen police car off one of the piers at the beginning of ''The Hard Goodbye''.
*'''Kadie's Club Pecos''' is a strip club and bar in Old Town, where Nancy Callahan and Shellie work, and where Dwight McCarthy and Marv spend their spare time.  Despite being filled with  drunk and violent men, Kadie's bar is one of the safest areas in Sin City since it is heavily guarded by prostitutes and their protectors.  Marv, who possesses an extraordinarily high sense of chivalry, protects the female employees of Kadie's from any violence that makes its way inside.
*'''Roark Family Farm''' (a.k.a. "The Farm") is located at North Cross and Lennox on the hills outside Basin City and shows up in several stories, including ''The Hard Goodbye'', ''That Yellow Bastard'', '' The Babe Wore Red'' and ''Hell and Back''.  It was also home to Kevin, a [[serial killer]] with ties to the Roark family.  Marv burns down one of the buildings, and the Farm is abandoned sometime after the initial ''Sin City'' storyline. The Farm is the only location in the comic books that is outside Basin City.
*'''Old Town''' is the [[red-light district]], where the city's population of prostitutes reside. Old Town is run by Goldie and Wendy. Old Town is off limits to the police. Though willing to engage in almost any sexual act for the right price, the women of Old Town show no mercy to those who "break the rules," and back up their independence with lethal force.  The mafia families and pimps who were into Old Town's business were thrown out of the neighborhood.
*'''Sacred Oaks''' is the home to the rich and powerful of Sin City.  This suburb is located on the outskirts of Basin City as a protection. A university is located in Sacred Oaks, and the entire area is patrolled by armed employees of its wealthy inhabitants, mostly SWAT teams.
*'''Basin City Central Train Station''', which has a direct connection to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. It is located in the outskirts near The Docks and it is considered one of safer places.
*'''Mimi's''', a small run-down motel on the far outskirts of Basin City, with only few rooms and a place where young couples make love. Nancy and Hartigan hid in Mimi's where she confessed her love to him. Junior also attacked Hartigan here and left him to die, although he saved himself.
*'''The Santa Yolanda Tar Pits''', an abandoned amusement park of sorts outside the city, where several [[tar pits]] are located and dinosaur bones were excavated at some time.  After a "big-budget dinosaur movie" caused a sensation, the county put up concrete statues of dinosaurs there to draw crowds.  However, after an old lady fell through a railing into one of the pits and had a heart attack, the place was shut down indefinitely.  They are frequently used as a place to dump things that people don't want found; high-schoolers also tend to sneak in there a lot.  This is where Delia tells Phil to drive in ''Wrong Turn'' and where Dwight takes the corpses of Jackie Boy and his friends in ''The Big Fat Kill''.  Frank Miller has admitted the main reason the Tar Pits exist is as an excuse to draw the dinosaur statues.

===Organizations===
Because a large majority of the residents of Basin City are criminals, there are several organizations and cartels central to the stories who are vying for monopoly over the various criminal enterprises in the city.  Listed below are crime syndicates, gangs and other low-lifes who figure heavily in the Sin City mythos.

;'''The Basin City Police Department''': So deep does corruption and criminality run in Basin City that even their police officers qualify as a gang of paid thugs, turning a blind eye to the affairs of those too poor to pay them off.  Few among them are considered incorruptible; even the honest officers are unable (or unwilling) to curtail the criminal actions of the dishonest ones.  Notable characters in the series who are police include Detective [[John Hartigan]], his partner Bob, Lieutenants [[Jack Rafferty]] and Mort, [[Commissioner]] Liebowitz, and Officers Manson and Bundy from ''Hell and Back''.

;'''[[Roark family]]''': A dynasty of corrupt landowners and politicians whose influence over Basin City has stretched as far back as the days of the Old West.  Famous Roarks of this generation include a senator, a cardinal, an attorney general, and [[Roark Junior|Roark Junior, 'That Yellow Bastard']].

;'''[[The Girls of Old Town]]''': Populating the region of Basin City known as Old Town is a group of women in [[Prostitution|the world's oldest profession]], having made a truce with the cops to allow them to govern and police themselves.  As of ''A Dame To Kill For'', they were led by the twins, Goldie and Wendy.

;'''[[Wallenquist Organization]]''': A powerful crime syndicate led by Herr Wallenquist, a mysterious crime lord with a broad range of criminal enterprises to his name.  Although they are one of the city's two "normal" criminal organizations, the Wallenquist management seems to be the most peaceful and forgiving of the various leaders. It is unknown which crime rings they hold.

;'''[[Magliozzi Crime Family]]''': The undisputed heads of the local [[Cosa Nostra]], the Magliozzi family seems to be the purest example of "true" [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] lifestyle.  While they appear in only one story, it is hinted that the Mafia influence in Basin City's underworld is a lot larger than just their family and that there are more families.

Other groups that have been seen or mentioned in the comics include:

;'''[[Tong (organization)|Tong]] gangsters''': Mentioned, but not seen as of ''A Dame To Kill For''.  Miho's life was saved by Dwight when he secretly protected her during a fight with several Tong gangsters in a dark alleyway.
;'''White slavers''': Mentioned, but not seen as of ''A Dame To Kill For''.  Led by a man named Manuel, whose brothers were also involved.  Were "taken care of" by Dwight prior to the events of ''A Dame To Kill For''.
;'''Irish mercenaries''': Seen during ''The Big Fat Kill'', most of them are evidently former [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] members, as implied by one of the mercenaries referring to his glee at blowing up a [[public house]] ([[United Kingdom|British]] pubs were targeted by the IRA).  All are killed by Dwight and Miho.

==''Sin City'' yarns==

These are the individual stories, usually referred to as "yarns," set in Frank Miller's Sin City universe.

===Collected editions===
The stories have been collected into [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]] and hardcover "Library Editions". There is also a collection of art, ''The Art of Sin City''. The hardcovers include two releases, which include Volume 1 (Books 1-4) and 2 (Books 5-7 and "The Art of"). Additionally, Dark Horse released an omnibus-style collection, ''[[Frank Miller's Big Damn Sin City]]'', containing all seven books and "The Art of" in one oversized volume.

===Chronology===
While ''The Hard Goodbye'' was the first story written, the first section of ''That Yellow Bastard'' is the first story chronologically. The Dwight-related stories fall in between these, with the short stories fleshing out the time between the main stories. Here is a rough chronology of the "Yarns":

*The first section of ''That Yellow Bastard'', wherein Detective John Hartigan rescues Nancy Callahan from Roark Jr., resulting in Hartigan and Junior winding up in the hospital, occurs at least twelve years before the events of ''The Hard Goodbye''. After being gunned down by his partner, Bob, Hartigan is framed as a child molester and charged with raping Nancy Callahan. He is placed into solitary confinement for eight years. Liebowitz beats Hartigan, trying to gain a confession. Mort is seen briefly in the hospital, where he tries to convince Hartigan to defend himself.
*Ava leaves Dwight and marries Damien Lord some time during this, referred to in ''A Dame To Kill For''.
*Hartigan is put on parole, meeting up with Mort. finds the nineteen-year-old Nancy Callahan when he is out on parole. It is also on this night that Dwight goes home with Shellie, and sleeps with her (he is seen whining to Shellie when Hartigan enters Kadie’s). Marv witnesses the reunion of Nancy and Hartigan, as shown in the beginning of ''Just Another Saturday Night''.
*The remaining events of ''That Yellow Bastard'' play out within the next few hours or so.
*About a year later, Dwight secretly saves Miho from Tong gangsters; revealing this saves him during ''A Dame to Kill For''.
*Three years later, the twins, Goldie and Wendy, take over Old Town. A few weeks later, Ava Lord contacts Dwight and asks to meet him. Ava mentions that it has been about four years since they last saw each other and Dwight agrees. Manute interrupts their meeting. Fearing for her safety, Dwight goes to Kadie’s and recruits the help of Marv.  Shellie lectures Dwight at having not seen nor heard from him in six months.
*Marv and Dwight attack the home of Damien and Ava Lord. Marv fights Manute, and Manute loses his eye in the process. After Damien is killed, Dwight is taken to Old Town by Marv, badly wounded. Dwight begins to be rehabilitated at this point.
*Gail, Dwight, Miho and Shellie develop a plan to get revenge on Ava Lord. Gail and the others tell Shellie that Dwight is still alive, and brief her on what she should tell the cops. On this same night, Delia (a.k.a. ''Blue Eyes'') is inducted into the service of Wallenquist, placing her in league with the Colonel. Marv is at the bar when Delia sweeps off with her prey, happily resuming his nocturnal drinking habits. Manute is also briefly seen interacting with the Colonel, sporting a neck-brace.
*One night, possibly the same one as ''Blue Eyes'', Marv meets Goldie at Kadie's. ''The Hard Goodbye'' begins with Marv waking and finding Goldie dead.
*In the beginning of Marv’s rampage, he goes to Kadie’s to try to draw attention to himself. On the same night, Mort and Bob arrive at Kadie’s (mere seconds after Marv’s arrival) and interview Shellie about Dwight's location following the murder of Damien Lord. She relays to them all that she'd been instructed to by the Old Town girls in ''Blue Eyes'' and sends them on their way.
*A few days into Marv’s rampage, Bob (Hartigan's former partner in ''That Yellow Bastard'') is shot dead by his partner Mort, who takes his own life (''A Dame to Kill For'').
*Less than three months later, Ava and Wallenquist unite their criminal empires. Dwight (with a new face), Miho, and Gail raid Ava Lord’s estate, with Manute being gravely injured by both Miho and Dwight. Dwight kills Ava.
*''The Babe Wore Red'' occurs, and in the story, Dwight states that Marv is currently on death row, framed for the deaths of Goldie and several others from ''The Hard Goodbye''.
*''Fat Man and Little Boy'' occurs, assuming{{Original research inline|date=January 2010}} the witness they failed to silence is Mary, and that the two are concurrent.
*Eighteen months after the beginning of ''The Hard Goodbye'', Wendy visits Marv on death row. A day later, he is executed by electric chair, dying on the second attempt (after the voltage from the first attempt was insufficient to kill him).
*''Wrong Turn'' occurs and Delia kills the wrong target. Delia, the Colonel and Gordo dispose of the dead men. ''Wrong Turn'' features the first mention of Mariah, who makes her first full appearance in ''Hell and Back''.
*''Wrong Track'' occurs shortly after ''Wrong Turn'', as Delia tries to kill the real target (on his way back from a delivery).
*''The Big Fat Kill'' occurs. On a hot summer night, shortly before a major thunderstorm, Miho slaughters Jackie Boy and his friends. Dwight, in an attempt to prevent a mob war, tries to dispose of Jackie Boy. The [[The Girls of Old Town|Old Town girl]] known as Becky betrays them to the mob (Wallenquist, represented through Manute) in an attempt to make money and get out of the prostitution game. Manute, embittered by the death of Ava Lord, captures Gail and encourages a trade: Jackie Boy’s head for Gail. Dwight and Miho arrange the trade, but the Old Town girls kill Becky and all of the other mob men. Manute is finally killed during a shoot-out. Wendy is also notably absent from this story, implying she was either still in hiding or otherwise preoccupied at the time, forcing Gail to take command of the girls.
*''Family Values'' takes place in winter after ''The Big Fat Kill'', indicated by Dwight making reference to Miho’s previous killing of a cop (“The Big Fat Kill”), as well as his acknowledgement of Fat Man and Little Boy, who he says he shot in the legs last time he saw them (''The Babe Wore Red'').
*''Behind Door Number Three...'' occurs at some point after Marv's capture, most likely after he was visited in prison by Wendy on the night of his execution; this is suggested by the fact she is seen wearing either Marv's [[crucifix necklace]] or one very similar, perhaps as a gift from him or as a way of honoring his sacrifice.
*''Wrong Turn'' and ''Wrong Track'' occur immediately after one another, as Delia continues to pursue the same target.

The short stories ''Rats'', ''The Customer is Always Right'' and ''Daddy's Little Girl'' do not contain any of the series' regular characters, are not connected to the other stories, or do not give an idea of when the stories occur. ''Silent Night'' takes place sometime before ''The Hard Goodbye'' during the winter, as Marv is still quite alive and seen lumbering through one of Basin City's rare snow-storms. Robert Rodriguez stated that ''The Customer is Always Right'' occurs in between "That Yellow Bastard" and "The Hard Goodbye" on the ''Sin City: Recut and Extended DVD Edition''.

''Hell and Back'' does not fit into any particular time period. Manute is seen, alive with his false eye, suggesting that the events take place between ''A Dame to Kill For'' and ''The Big Fat Kill'' however, it is established that ''Hell and Back'' takes place over several cool nights in September; ''The Big Fat Kill'' took place on a hot summer night during a thunderstorm. (Potential reconciliation: Hell and Back AND The Big Fat Kill take place before September 21, if Miller is using any date before that as still, technically, "the summer".)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12179">'''Sound studies''' is an interdisciplinary field that to date has focused largely on the emergence of the concept of "sound" in Western modernity, with an emphasis on the development of sound reproduction technologies. The field first emerged in venues like the journal ''Social Studies of Science'' by scholars working in [[science and technology studies]] and [[communication studies]]; it has however greatly expanded and now includes a broad array of scholars working in music, anthropology, [[sound art]], [[deaf studies]], [[architecture]], and many other fields besides. Important studies have focused on the idea of a "soundscape", architectural acoustics, nature sounds, the history of aurality in [[Western philosophy]] and nineteenth-century Colombia, Islamic approaches to listening, the voice, studies of deafness, loudness, and related topics. A foundational text is Jonathan Sterne's 2003 book "The Audible Past", though the field has retroactively taken as foundational two texts from 1977, [[Jacques Attali]]'s "Noise" and [[R. Murray Schafer]]'s "The Soundscape".

Initial work in the field was criticized for focusing mainly on white male inventors in Euro-America. Consequently the field is currently in a period of expansion, with important texts coming out in recent years on sound, listening, and hearing as they relate to blackness, gender, and [[colonialism]].

==Hearing and listening==

Two significant categories to what we hear and pay attention to are natural and technological sounds. According to R. Murray Schaeffer (through a survey of quotes in the literature), the proportion of nature sounds heard and noticed among European authors has decreased over the past two centuries from 43% to 20%, but not for North America, where it has stayed around 50%. Additionally, the proportion of technological sounds mentioned in literature has stayed around 35% for Europe, but decreased in North America. While technological increases have not been sonically noticed, the decrease in silence has been noticed, from 19% to 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schafer|first1=R. Murray|title=The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World|date=1994|publisher=Destiny Books|location=Rochester, Vermont|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the idea of listening, objects can be considered auditorily as compared to visually. The objects that are able to be experienced by sight and by sound can be thought of in a [[venn diagram]], with mute and visible objects in the vision category, with aural and invisible objects in the sound category, and aural and visible objects in the overlapping category. Objects that do not fall into a specific category can be considered beyond the horizons of sound and sight. The common denominator for aural objects is movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ihde|first1=Don|title=Listening and Voice: A Phenomenology of Sound|date=1974|publisher=Ohio University Press|location=Athens|pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three modes of listening have been recognized; causal listening, semantic listening, and reduced listening. Causal listening, the most common, consists of listening in order to gather ideas about its source. Sound in this case is informational and can be used to recognize voices, determine distance, or understand differences between humans and machines. Semantic listening is when a sound is not only heard but also processed. When a sound is given meaning and context, as seen in speech and fluent dialogue. Reduced listening focuses on the traits of the sound itself regardless of cause and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chion|first1=Michel|title=Audio Vision: Sound on Screen|date=1990|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=48–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spaces, sites and scapes==

Sound is heard through space. But this defining of sound and space is further nuanced by their interdependent existence, creation, and dissolution. This idea of the acoustic environment and its social inextricability has become a source of interest within the field of sound studies. Critical to this contemporary discussion of the symbiotic social space and sonic space is R. Murray Schafer's concept of the soundscape. Schafer uses the term soundscape to describe "a total appreciation of the sonic environment," and, through soundscape studies, attempts to more holistically understand "the relationship between man and the sounds of his environment and what happens when those sounds change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schafer|first1=R. Murray|title=The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World|date=1994|publisher=Destiny Books|location=Rochester, Vermont|pages=8, 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In understanding the environment as events being heard, the soundscape is indicative of the social conditions and characteristics that create it. In industrialized cities, the soundscape is industrial noises, in a rainforest the soundscape is the sound of nature, and in an empty space the soundscape is silence. Moreover, the soundscape is argued to foretell future societal trends. The soundscape is not just representative of the environment which surrounds it but it makes up its very essence. The soundscape is the environment on a wavelength that is auditory rather than tactile or visible, but very much as real.

Schaffer's concept of the soundscape has become a hallmark of sound studies and is referenced, built upon, and criticized by writers from a wide breadth of disciplines and perspectives. Common themes explored through the analysis of the soundscape are the conflict between nature and industry, the impact of technology on sound production and consumption, the issue of cultural sound values and the evolution of acoustics, and the power dynamics of silence and noise.

==Transduce and record==

Our perception of a recorded sound's authenticity has been greatly impacted by the commercial influence of capitalism. Even the dead now profit from recordings they've made, making music more timeless than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanyek|first1=Jason|last2=Piekut|first2=Benjamin|title=Deadness: Technologies of the Intermundane|date=2010|pages=14–21 &amp; 27–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bringing the past into the present generates a sense of familiarity which compels the public to engage in new forms of listening.

In a Memorex commercial involving Ella Fitzgerald and Chuck Mangione, Fitzgerald is unable to discern the difference between a live performance and a recording of Mangione playing the trumpet. This presents a scene to viewers which sells cassette tapes as ideal objects of high-fidelity, auditory preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowitt|first1=John|title=The Sound of Music in the Era of its Electronic Reproducibility|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|pages=184–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was once an autonomic experience of memory which integrated visual and auditory stimuli (live music) has become a consumable item which popularizes and commodifies sonic memory explicitly.

Part of this shift in the dynamics of recorded sound has to do with a desire for noise reduction. This desire is representative of a mode of recording referred to by scholar James Lastra as "telephonic:" a mode in which sound is regarded as having hierarchically important qualities, with clarity and intelligibility being the most important aspects. This contrasts with phonographic recording, which generates a "point of audition" from which a sense of space can be derived, sacrificing quality for uniqueness and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lastra|first1=James|title=Sound Theory. "Fidelity Versus Intelligibility"|date=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=138–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is often used in movies to demonstrate how a character hears something (such as muffled voices through a closed door). Through various forms of media, recorded music affects our perceptions and consumptive practices more often than we realize.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2166">'''Stand-up tragedy''' is a style of tragic performance where a performer performs in front of a live audience, speaking directly to them.  The goal of Stand-up tragedy is to make the audience members cry.&lt;ref&gt;Thacker, Johnathan. "Bryan Lewis Saunders Offers Original Material To The Area." ''East Tennessean'' 14 May 2010.  Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Stand-up tragedy performances are usually long and employ the use of various media such as video, audio, highly emotional monologues and rants where the performer recites a fast-paced succession of tragic and disturbing stories.  Stand-up tragedy is often performed in bars, nightclubs, private homes, art museums, galleries and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Jon. "Interview: Bryan Lewis Saunders." ''Rhythmplex'' April 2009. Web. 26 April 2009. {{cite web |url=http://www.rhythmplex.com/2009/04/interview-bryan-lewis-saunders/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017200427/http://www.rhythmplex.com/2009/04/interview-bryan-lewis-saunders/ |archivedate=17 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origin of the term Stand up tragedy is unknown.{{cn|date=February 2016}} The comedian [[Brother Theodore]] (1906–2001) used the term to describe his comedic act which was dark, and had an absurdist edge.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Douglas. "Theodore Gottlieb, Dark Comic, Dies at 96." ''The New York Times.'' 6 April 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Beat poet [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] (1919-) often refers to himself as a "stand-up tragedian",
&lt;ref&gt;W W Norton &amp; Co Inc. Ferlinghetti, Lawrence. ''"Far Rockaway of the Heart."'' New Directions Publishing Corporation, Sept. 1998. Print.  {{ISBN|0-8112-1398-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performance artist [[Bryan Lewis Saunders]] uses it to describe his own act in a more literal sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Geoff &amp; Gorman, Ty.

===Secular French theatre===
Discussions about the origins of non-religious theatre ("théâtre profane") -- both drama and farce—in the Middle Ages remain controversial, but the idea of a continuous popular tradition stemming from Latin comedy and tragedy to the 9th century seems unlikely.

Most historians place the origin of medieval drama in the church's liturgical dialogues and "tropes".  At first simply dramatizations of the ritual, particularly in those rituals connected with Christmas and Easter (see ''[[Mystery play]]''), plays were eventually transferred from the monastery church to the chapter house or refectory hall and finally to the open air, and the vernacular was substituted for Latin.  In the 12th century one finds the earliest extant passages in French appearing as refrains inserted into [[liturgical drama]]s in Latin, such as a [[Saint Nicholas]] (patron saint of the student clercs) play and a [[Saint Stephen]] play.

Dramatic plays in French from the 12th and 13th centuries:
* [[Le Jeu d'Adam]] (1150–1160) - written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets with Latin stage directions (implying that it was written by Latin-speaking clerics for a lay public)
* Le Jeu de Saint Nicolas - [[Jean Bodel]] - written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets
* [[Le Miracle de Théophile]] - [[Rutebeuf]] (c.1265)

The origins of farce and comic theatre remain equally controversial; some                                                            −literary historians believe in a non-liturgical origin (among "jongleurs" or in pagan and folk festivals), others see the influence of liturgical drama (some of the dramas listed above include farcical sequences) and monastic readings of [[Plautus]] and Latin comic theatre.

Non-dramatic plays from the 12th and 13th centuries:
* Le Dit de l'herberie - [[Rutebeuf]]
* Courtois d'Arras (c.1228)
* Le Jeu de la feuillé (1275) - [[Adam de la Halle]]
* Le [[Jeu de Robin et Marion]] (a pastourelle) (1288) -  [[Adam de la Halle]]
* Le Jeu du Pèlerin (1288)
* [[Le Garçon et l'aveugle]] (1266–1282) - earliest surviving French [[farce]]
* [[Aucassin et Nicolette]] (a chantefable) - a mixture of prose and lyrical passages

Select list of plays from the 14th and 15th centuries:
* La Farce de maître Trubert et d'Antrongnard - [[Eustache Deschamps]]
* Le Dit des quatre offices de l'ostel du roy - [[Eustache Deschamps]]
* Miracles de Notre Dame
* Bien Avisé et mal avisé (morality) (1439)
* [[La Farce de maître Pierre Pathelin]] (1464–1469) - this play had a great influence on [[Rabelais]] in the 16th century
* Le Franc archer de Bagnolet (1468–1473)
* Moralité (1486) - [[Henri Baude]]
* L'Homme pécheur (morality) (1494)
* La Farce du cuvier
* La Farce nouvelle du pâté et de la tarte

In the 15th century, the public representation of plays was organized and controlled by a number of professional and semi-professional guilds:
* Clercs de la [[Basoche]] (Paris) - [[Morality plays]]
* [[Enfants sans Souci]] (Paris) - [[Farces]] and [[Sottie]]s
* [[Conards]] (Rouen)
* [[Confrérie de la Passion]] (Paris) - [[Mystery plays]]

Genres of theatre practiced in the Middle Ages in France:
* [[Farce]] - a realistic, humorous, and even coarse satire of human failings
* [[Sottie]] - generally a conversation among idiots ("sots"), full of [[pun]]s and quidproquos
* [[Pastourelle]] - a play with a pastoral setting
* Chantefable - a mixed verse and prose form only found in "Aucassin et Nicolette"
* [[Mystery play]] - a depiction of the Christian mysteries or Saint's lives
* [[Morality play]]
* [[Miracle play]]
* [[Passion play]]
* Sermon Joyeux - a burlesque sermon

===Renaissance theatre===
16th-century French theatre followed the same patterns of evolution as the other literary genres of the period. For the first decades of the century, public theatre remained largely tied to its long medieval heritage of [[mystery play]]s, [[morality play]]s, [[farce]]s, and [[sotie]]s, although the [[miracle play]] was no longer in vogue. Public performances were tightly controlled by a guild system. The guild "les Confrères de la Passion" had exclusive rights to theatrical productions of mystery plays in Paris; in 1548, fear of violence or blasphemy resulting from the growing religious rift in France forced the [[Parlement de Paris|Paris Parliament]] to prohibit performances of the mysteries in the capital, although they continued to be performed in other places. Another guild, the "Enfants Sans-Souci" was in charge of farces and soties, as too the "Clercs de la Basoche" who also performed morality plays. Like the "Confrères de la Passion", "la [[Basoche]]" came under political scrutiny (plays had to be authorized by a review board; masks or characters depicting living persons were not permitted), and they were finally suppressed in 1582.  By the end of the century, only the "Confrères de la Passion" remained with exclusive control over public theatrical productions in Paris, and they rented out their theatre at the [[Hôtel de Bourgogne (theatre)|Hôtel de Bourgogne]] to theatrical troupes for a high price. In 1597,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett|first=Oscar|title=History of the Theatre, 9th Edition|year=2003|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|isbn=0-205-35878-0|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; they abandoned this privilege.

Alongside the numerous writers of these traditional works (such as the farce writers [[Pierre Gringore]], [[Nicolas de La Chesnaye]] and [[André de la Vigne]]), [[Marguerite de Navarre]] also wrote a number of plays close to the traditional mystery and morality play.

As early as 1503 however, original language versions of [[Sophocles]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Euripides]], [[Aristophanes]], [[Terence]] and [[Plautus]] were all available in Europe and the next forty years would see humanists and poets both translating these classics and adapting them. In the 1540s, the French university setting (and especially &amp;mdash; from 1553 on &amp;mdash; the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theatre (in Latin) written by professors such as [[George Buchanan (humanist)|George Buchanan]] and [[Marc Antoine Muret]] which would leave a profound mark on the members of [[La Pléiade]]. From 1550 on, one finds humanist theatre written in French.

The influence of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] was particularly strong in humanist tragedy. His plays &amp;mdash; which were essentially chamber plays meant to be read for their lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory &amp;mdash; brought to many humanist tragedies a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action.

Humanist tragedy took two distinct directions:
* ''Biblical tragedy'': plots taken from the bible &amp;mdash; although close in inspiration to the medieval mystery plays, the humanist biblical tragedy reconceived the biblical characters along classical lines, suppressing both comic elements and the presence of God on the stage.  The plots often had clear parallels to contemporary political and religious matters and one finds both Protestant and Catholic playwrights.
* ''Ancient tragedy'': plots taken from mythology or history &amp;mdash; they often had clear parallels to contemporary political and religious matters

During the height of the civil wars (1570–1580), a third category of militant theatre appeared:
* ''Contemporary tragedy'': plots taken from recent events

Along with their work as translators and adaptors of plays, the humanists also investigated classical theories of dramatic structure, plot, and characterization. [[Horace]] was translated in the 1540s, but had been available throughout the Middle Ages. A complete version of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Poetics'' appeared later (first in 1570 in an Italian version), but his ideas had circulated (in an extremely truncated form) as early as the 13th century in Hermann the German's Latin translation of [[Averroes]]' Arabic gloss, and other translations of the ''Poetics'' had appeared in the first half of the 16th century; also of importance were the commentaries on Aristotle's poetics by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] which appeared in the 1560s. The fourth century grammarians Diomedes and [[Aelius Donatus]] were also a source of classical theory. The sixteenth century Italians played a central role in the publishing and interpretation of classical dramatic theory, and their works had a major effect on French theatre. [[Lodovico Castelvetro]]'s Aristote-based ''Art of Poetry''(1570) was one of the first enunciations of the [[three unities]]; this work would inform [[Jean de la Taille]]'s ''Art de la tragedie'' (1572). Italian theatre (like the tragedy of [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]]) and debates on decorum (like those provoked by [[Sperone Speroni]]'s play ''Canace'' and [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi]]'s play ''Orbecche'') would also influence the French tradition.

In the same spirit of imitation &amp;mdash; and adaptation &amp;mdash; of classical sources that had informed the poetic compositions of ''La Pléiade'', French humanist writers recommended that tragedy should be in five acts and have three main characters of noble rank; the play should begin in the middle of the action ([[in medias res]]), use noble language and not show scenes of horror on the stage. Some writers (like [[Lazare de Baïf]] and [[Thomas Sébillet]]) attempted to link the medieval tradition of morality plays and farces to classical theatre, but [[Joachim du Bellay]] rejected this claim and elevated classical tragedy and comedy to a higher dignity.  Of greater difficulty for the theorists was the incorporation of Aristotle's notion of "[[catharsis]]" or the purgation of emotions with Renaissance theatre, which remained profoundly attached to both pleasing the audience and to the rhetorical aim of showing moral examples ([[exemplum]]).

[[Étienne Jodelle]]'s ''[[Cléopâtre captive]]'' (1553) &amp;mdash; which tells the impassioned fears and doubts of Cleopatra contemplating suicide &amp;mdash; has the distinction of being the first original French play to follow [[Horace]]'s classical precepts on structure (the play is in five acts and respects more or less the unities of time, place and action) and is extremely close to the ancient model: the prologue is introduced by a shade, there is a classical chorus which comments on the action and talks directly to the characters, and the tragic ending is described by a messenger.

[[Mellin de Saint-Gelais]]'s translation of [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]]'s ''La Sophonisbe'' &amp;mdash; the first modern regular tragedy based on ancient models which tells the story of the noble [[Sophonisba]]'s suicide (rather than be taken as captive by Rome) &amp;mdash; was an enormous success at the court when performed in 1556.

(See the playwrights [[Antoine de Montchrestien]], [[Alexandre Hardy]] and [[Jean de Schelandre]] for tragedy around 1600-1610.)

Alongside tragedy, European humanists also adapted the ancient comedic tradition and as early as the 15th century, Renaissance Italy had developed a form of humanist Latin comedy. Although the ancients had been less theoretical about the comedic form, the humanists used the precepts of [[Aelius Donatus]] (4th century AD), [[Horace]], [[Aristotle]] and the works of [[Terence]] to elaborate a set of rules: comedy should seek to correct vice by showing the truth; there should be a happy ending; comedy uses a lower style of language than tragedy; comedy does not paint the great events of states and leaders, but the private lives of people, and its principle subject is love.

Although some French authors kept close to the ancient models ([[Pierre de Ronsard]] translated a part of [[Aristophanes]]'s "Plutus" at college), on the whole the French comedic tradition shows a great deal of borrowing from all sources: medieval farce (which continued to be immensely popular throughout the century), the short story, Italian humanist comedies and "La Celestina" (by [[Fernando de Rojas]]).

In the last decades of the century, four other theatrical modes from Italy &amp;mdash; which did not follow the rigid rules of classical theatre – flooded the French stage:

* the [[Commedia dell'arte]] &amp;mdash; an improvisational theatre of fixed types (Harlequin, Colombo) created in [[Padua]] in 1545; Italian troupes were invited in France from 1576 on.
*the [[Tragicomedy]] &amp;mdash; a theatrical version of the adventurous novel, with lovers, knights, disguises and magic.  The most famous of these is [[Robert Garnier]]'s ''Bradamante'' (1580), adapted from [[Ariosto]]'s [[Orlando furioso]].
* the [[Pastoral]] &amp;mdash; modeled on [[Giambattista Guarini]]'s "Pastor fido" ("Faithful Shepard"), [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s "Aminta" and [[Antonio Ongaro]] "Alceo" (themselves inspired by [[Jacopo Sannazaro]] and [[Jorge de Montemayor]]). The first French pastorals were short plays performed before a tragedy, but were eventually expanded into five acts.  [[Nicolas de Montreux]] wrote three pastorals: ''Athlette'' (1585), ''Diane'' (1592) ''Arimène ou le berger désespéré'' (1597).
* the [[Ballets de cour]] (Court Ballet) &amp;mdash; an allegorical  and fantastic mixture of dance and theatre.  The most famous of these is the "Ballet comique de la reine" (1581).

By the end of the century, the most influential French playwright &amp;mdash; by the range of his styles and by his mastery of the new forms &amp;mdash; would be [[Robert Garnier]].

All of these eclectic traditions would continue to evolve in the "baroque" theatre of the early 17th century, before French "classicism" would finally impose itself.

===Early modern theatres and theatrical companies===
During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, public theatrical representations in Paris were under the control of guilds, but in the last decades of the sixteenth century only one of these continued to exist: although "les [[Confrèrie de la Passion]]" no longer had the right to perform mystery plays (1548), they were given exclusive rights to oversee all theatrical productions in the capital and rented out their theatre (the [[Hôtel de Bourgogne (theatre)|Hôtel de Bourgogne]]) to theatrical troupes at a high price.  In 1597, this guild abandoned its privilege which permitted other theatres and theatrical companies to eventually open in the capital.

In addition to public theatres, plays were produced in private residences, before the court and in the university.  In the first half of the century, the public, the humanist theatre of the colleges and the theatre performed at court showed extremely divergent tastes.  For example, while the tragicomedy was fashionable at the court in the first decade, the public was more interested in tragedy.

The early theatres in Paris were often placed in existing structures like [[tennis court]]s; their stages were extremely narrow, and facilities for sets and scene changes were often non-existent (this would encourage the development of the unity of place).  Eventually, theatres would develop systems of elaborate machines and decors, fashionable for the chevaleresque flights of knights found in the [[tragicomedy|tragicomedies]] of the first half of the century.

In the early part of the century, the theatre performances took place twice a week starting at two or three o'clock.  Theatrical representations often encompassed several works, beginning with a comic prologue, then a tragedy or tragicomedy, then a farce and finally a song.  Nobles sometimes sat on the side of the stage during the performance.  Given that it was impossible to lower the house lights, the audience was always aware of each other and spectators were notably vocal during performances.  The place directly in front of the stage, without seats—the "parterre"—was reserved for men, but being the cheapest tickets, the parterre was usually a mix of social groups.  Elegant people watched the show from the galleries.  Princes, [[musketeer]]s and royal pages were given free entry.  Before 1630, an honest woman did not go to the theatre.

Unlike England, France placed no restrictions on women performing on stage, but the career of actors of either sex was seen as morally wrong by the Catholic Church (actors were [[excommunication|excommunicated]]) and by the ascetic religious [[Jansenist]] movement.  Actors typically had fantastic stage names that described typical roles or stereotypical characters.

In addition to scripted comedies and tragedies, Parisians were also great fans of the Italian acting troupe who performed their [[Commedia dell'arte]], a kind of improvised theatre based on types.  The characters from the Commedia dell'arte would have a profound effect on French theatre, and one finds echoes of them in the braggarts, fools, lovers, old men and wily servants that populate French theatre.

[[Opera]] came to France in the second half of the century.

The most important theatres and troupes in Paris:

* [[Hôtel de Bourgogne (theatre)|Hôtel de Bourgogne]] - until 1629, this theatre was occupied by various troupes, including the ("[[Comédiens du Roi]]") directed by [[Valleran Lecomte]] and, at his death, by Bellerose ([[Pierre Le Messier]]).  The troupe became the official "Troupe Royale" in 1629.  Actors included: Turlupin, Gros-Guillaume, Gautier-Gargouille, [[Floridor]], Monfleury, [[Marie Champmeslé|la Champmeslé]].
* [[Théâtre du Marais]] (1600–1673) - founded by [[Charles Le Noir]] and [[Montdory]], this rival theatre of the Hôtel de Bourgogne housed the troupe "Vieux Comédiens du Roi" around [[Claude Deschamps]] and the troupe of [[Jodelet]].
* 'La troupe de Monsieur" - under the protection of Louis XIV's brother, this was Molière's first Paris troupe.  They moved to several theatres in Paris (the [[Petit-Bourbon]], the [[Théâtre du Palais-Royal (rue Saint-Honoré)|Palais-Royal]]) before combining in 1673 with the troupe of the Théâtre du Marais and becoming the troupe of the [[Théâtre Guénégaud|Hôtel Guénégaud]].
* La [[Comédie française]] - in 1680 Louis XIV united the Hôtel de Bourgogne and the Hôtel Guénégaud into one official troupe.

Outside of Paris, in the suburbs and in the provinces, there were many wandering theatrical troupes.  Molière got his start in such a troupe.

The royal court and other noble houses were also important organizers of theatrical representations, [[ballets de cour]], mock battles and other sorts of "divertissement" for their festivities, and in the some cases the roles of dancers and actors were held by the nobles themselves.  The early years at Versailles—before the massive expansion of the residence—were entirely consecrated to such pleasures, and similar spectacles continued throughout the reign.  Engravings show Louis XIV and the court seating outside before the "Cour du marbre" of Versailles watching the performance of a play.

The great majority of scripted plays in the seventeenth century were written in verse (notable exceptions include some of Molière's comedies).  Except for lyric passages in these plays, the meter used was a twelve-syllable line (the "[[French alexandrine|alexandrine]]") with a regular pause or "[[cesura]]" after the sixth syllable; these lines were put into rhymed [[couplet]]s; couplets alternated between "feminine" (i.e. ending in a mute e) and "masculine" (i.e. ending in a vowel other than a mute e, or in a consonant or a nasal) rhymes.

===Baroque theatre===
French theatre from the seventeenth century is often reduced to three great names — [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine]] — and to the triumph of "classicism"; the truth is however far more complicated.

Theatre at the beginning of the century was dominated by the genres and dramatists of the previous generation.  Most influential in this respect was [[Verenice Flores]].  Although the royal court had grown tired of the [[tragedy]] (preferring the more escapist [[tragicomedy]]), the theatre going public preferred the former.  This would change in the 1630s and 1640s when, influenced by the long baroque novels of the period, the tragicomedy—a heroic and magical adventure of knights and maidens—became the dominant genre.  The amazing success of Corneille's "Le Cid" in 1637 and "Horace" in 1640 would bring the tragedy back into fashion, where it would remain for the rest of the century.

The most important source for tragic theatre was [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and the precepts of [[Horace]] and [[Aristotle]] (and modern commentaries by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] and [[Lodovico Castelvetro]]), although plots were taken from classical authors such as [[Plutarch]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], etc. and from short story collections (Italian, French and Spanish).  The Greek tragic authors ([[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]]) would become increasingly important by the middle of the century.  Important models for both comedy, tragedy and tragicomedy of the century were also supplied by the Spanish playwrights [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Tirso de Molina]] and [[Lope de Vega]], many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage.  Important theatrical models were also supplied by the Italian stage (including the [[pastoral]]), and Italy was also an important source for theoretical discussions on theatre, especially with regards to decorum (see for example the debates on [[Sperone Speroni]]'s play ''Canace'' and [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi]]'s play ''Orbecche'').&lt;ref&gt;See, among other works: Bray, René.  ''La formation de la doctrine classique en France''.  Paris: Hachette, 1927.  For an analysis of theatre development in the Renaissance, see: Reiss. Timothy.  "Renaissance theatre and the theory of tragedy."  ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism.'' Volume III: The Renaissance. pp.229-247.  {{ISBN|0-521-30008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular comedies (i.e. comedies in five acts modeled on [[Plautus]] or [[Terence]] and the precepts of [[Aelius Donatus]]) were less frequent on the stage than tragedies and tragicomedies at the turn of the century, as the comedic element of the early stage was dominated by the farce, the satirical monologue and by the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].  [[Jean Rotrou]] and [[Pierre Corneille]] would return to the regular comedy shortly before 1630.

Corneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of "Le Cid" was even listed as a tragicomedy), for they had happy endings.  In his theoretical works on theatre, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions:
* The stage—in both comedy and tragedy—should feature noble characters (this would eliminate many low-characters, typical of the farce, from Corneille's comedies).  Noble characters should not be depicted as vile (reprehensible actions are generally due to non-noble characters in Corneille's plays).
* Tragedy deals with affairs of the state (wars, dynastic marriages); comedy deals with love. For a work to be tragic, it need not have a tragic ending.
* Although [[Aristotle]] says that [[catharsis]] (purgation of emotion) should be the goal of tragedy, this is only an ideal.  In conformity with the moral codes of the period, plays should not show evil being rewarded or nobility being degraded.

The history of the public and critical reaction to Corneille's "Le Cid" can be found in other articles (he was criticized for his use of sources, for his violation of good taste, and for other irregularities that did not conform to Aristotian or Horacian rules), but its impact was stunning.  [[Cardinal Richelieu]] asked the newly formed [[Académie française]] to investigate and pronounce on the criticisms (it was the Academy's first official judgement), and the controversy reveals a growing attempt to control and regulate theatre and theatrical forms.  This would be the beginning of seventeenth century "classicism".

Corneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also something he called "heroic comedies") and many continued to be successes, although the "irregularities" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticized (notably by [[François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac]]) and the success of [[Jean Racine]] from the late 1660s signaled the end of his preeminence.

===17th-century classicism&lt;!--'French neoclassical theatre' and 'Neoclassical theatre' redirect here--&gt;===
{{see also|French neoclassicism}}
The expression ''classicism'' as it applies to literature implies notions of order, clarity, moral purpose and good taste.  Many of these notions are directly inspired by the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Horace]] and by classical Greek and Roman masterpieces.

In '''French neoclassical theatre'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also called '''French neoclassicism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;Dennis J. Sporre, ''The Creative Impulse: An Introduction to the Arts'', Prentice Hall, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;414.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--citation for the term 'French neoclassical theatre'--&gt; a play should follow the ''[[Three Unities]]'':
* ''Unity of place'': the setting should not change.  In practice, this led to the frequent "Castle, interior".  Battles take place off stage.
* ''Unity of time'': ideally the entire play should take place in 24 hours.
* ''Unity of action'': there should be one central story and all secondary plots should be linked to it.

Although based on classical examples, the unities of place and time were seen as essential for the spectator's complete absorption into the dramatic action; wildly dispersed scenes in China or Africa, or over many years would—critics maintained—break the theatrical illusion.  Sometimes grouped with the unity of action is the notion that no character should appear unexpectedly late in the drama.

Linked with the theatrical unities are the following concepts:
* "''Les bienséances''": literature should respect moral codes and good taste; nothing should be presented that flouts these codes, even if they are historical events.
* "''La vraisemblance''": actions should be believable.  When historical events contradict believability, some critics counselled the latter.  The criterion of believability was sometimes also used to criticize soliloquy, and in late classical plays characters are almost invariably supplied with confidents (valets, friends, nurses) to whom they reveal their emotions.

These rules precluded many elements common in the baroque "tragi-comedy": flying horses, chivalric battles, magical trips to foreign lands and the ''[[deus ex machina]]''. The mauling of Hippolyte by a monster in [[Phèdre]] could only take place offstage.

* Finally, literature and art should consciously follow Horace's precept "to please and educate" ("aut delectare aut prodesse est").

These "rules" or "codes" were seldom completely followed, and many of the century's masterpieces broke these rules intentionally to heighten emotional effect:
* Corneille's "Le Cid" was criticised for having Rodrigue appear before Chimène after having killed her father, a violation of moral codes.

===Theatre under Louis XIV===
By the 1660s, classicism had finally imposed itself on French theatre.  The key theoretical work on theatre from this period was [[François Hedelin, abbé d'Aubignac]]'s "Pratique du théâtre" (1657), and the dictates of this work reveal to what degree "French classicism" was willing to modify the rules of classical tragedy to maintain the unities and decorum (d'Aubignac for example saw the tragedies of [[Oedipus]] and [[Antigone]] as unsuitable for the contemporary stage).

Although [[Pierre Corneille]] continued to produce tragedies to the end of his life, the works of [[Jean Racine]] from the late 1660s on totally eclipsed the late plays of the elder dramatist.  Racine's tragedies—inspired by Greek myths, [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]—condensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, and concentrated on these characters' double-binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds.  Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of [[pathos]] and amorous passion (like [[Phèdre]]'s love for her stepson) and his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy to the end of the century.  Racine's two late plays ("Esther" and "Athalie") opened new doors to biblical subject matter and to the use of theatre in the education of young women.

Tragedy in the last two decades of the century and the first years of the eighteenth century was dominated by productions of classics from Pierre Corneille and Racine, but on the whole the public's enthusiasm for tragedy had greatly diminished: theatrical tragedy paled beside the dark economic and demographic problems at the end of the century and the "comedy of manners" (see below) had incorporated many of the moral goals of tragedy.  Other later century tragedians include: [[Claude Boyer]], [[Michel Le Clerc]], [[Jacques Pradon]], [[Jean Galbert de Campistron]], [[Jean de La Chapelle]], [[Antoine d'Aubigny de la Fosse]], l'abbé [[Charles-Claude Geneste]], [[Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon]].  At the end of the century, in the plays of Crébillon in particular, there occasionally appeared a return to the theatricality of the beginning of the century: multiple episodes, extravagant fear and pity, and the representation of gruesome actions on the stage.

Early French opera was particularly popular with the royal court in this period, and the composer [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] was extremely prolific (see the composer's article for more on court ballets and opera in this period).  These musical works carried on in the tradition of tragicomedy (especially the "pièces à machines") and court ballet, and also occasionally presented tragic plots (or "tragédies en musique").  The dramatists that worked with Lully included [[Pierre Corneille]] and [[Molière]], but the most important of these librettists was [[Philippe Quinault]], a writer of comedies, tragedies, and tragicomedies.

Comedy in the second half of the century was dominated by [[Molière]].  A veteran actor, master of farce, slapstick, the Italian and Spanish theatre (see above), and "regular" theatre modeled on [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], Molière's output was large and varied.  He is credited with giving the French "[[comedy of manners]]" ("comédie de mœurs") and the "comedy of character ("comédie de caractère") their modern form.  His hilarious satires of avaricious fathers, "[[précieuses]]", social parvenues, doctors and pompous literary types were extremely successful, but his comedies on religious hypocrisy ("[[Tartuffe]]") and libertinage ("[[Don Juan]]") brought him much criticism from the church, and "Tartuffe" was only performed through the intervention of the king.  Many of Molière's comedies, like "Tartuffe", "Don Juan" and the "[[Le Misanthrope]]" could veer between farce and the darkest of dramas, and the endings of "Don Juan" and the "Misanthrope" are far from being purely comic.

Comedy to the end of the century would continue on the paths traced by Molière: the satire of contemporary morals and manners and the "regular" comedy would dominate, and the last great "comedy" of Louis XIV's reign, [[Alain-René Lesage]]'s "Turcaret", is an immensely dark  play in which almost no character shows redeeming traits.

===19th century===
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
The major battle of romanticism in France was fought in the theatre.  The early years of the century were marked by a revival of classicism and classical-inspired tragedies, often with themes of national sacrifice or patriotic heroism in keeping with the spirit of the Revolution, but the production of [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' in 1830 marked the triumph of the romantic movement on the stage (a description of the turbulent opening night can be found in Théophile Gautier). The [[Three unities|dramatic unities]] of time and place were abolished, tragic and comic elements appeared together and metrical freedom was won.  Marked by the plays of [[Friedrich Schiller]], the romantics often chose subjects from historic periods (the [[French Renaissance]], the reign of [[Louis XIII of France]]) and doomed noble characters (rebel princes and outlaws) or misunderstood artists (Vigny's play based on the life of [[Thomas Chatterton]]).

By the middle of the century, theatre began to reflect more and more a realistic tendency, associated with [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]].  These tendencies can be seen in the theatrical [[melodrama]]s of the period and, in an even more lurid and gruesome light, in the [[Grand Guignol]] at the end of the century.  In addition to melodramas, popular and bourgeois theatre in the mid-century turned to realism in the "well-made" bourgeois farces of [[Eugène Marin Labiche]] and the moral dramas of [[Émile Augier]].  Also popular were the operettas, farces and comedies of [[Ludovic Halévy]], [[Henri Meilhac]], and, at the turn of the century, [[Georges Feydeau]]. Before the war, the most successful play was [[Octave Mirbeau]]'s great comedy ''Les affaires sont les affaires'' (''[[Business is business]]'') (1903).

The poetry of Baudelaire and much of the literature in the latter half of the century (or "[[fin de siècle]]") were often characterized as "[[decadent]]" for their lurid content or moral vision, but with the publication of [[Jean Moréas]] "Symbolist Manifesto" in 1886, it was the term [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] which was most often applied to the new literary environment.  Symbolism appeared in theatre in the works of writers [[Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]] and [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] among others.

{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
The most significant dramatist of turn of the century France was [[Alfred Jarry]].  The impact of his plays, primarily [[Ubu Roi]], was writ large upon contemporary audiences and has continued to be a major influence on, among others, ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' and ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''.

Avant-garde theatre in France after World War I was profoundly marked by [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]].  The Surrealist movement was a major force in experimental writing and the international art world until the Second World War, and the surrealists' technique was particularly well-suited for poetry and theatre, most notably in the theatrical works of [[Antonin Artaud]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].

Theatre in the 1920s and 1930s went through further changes in a loose association of theatres (called the "Cartel") around the directors and producers [[Louis Jouvet]], [[Charles Dullin]], [[Gaston Baty]], and Ludmila and [[Georges Pitoëff]].  They produced French works by [[Jean Giraudoux]], [[Jules Romains]], [[Jean Anouilh]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], as well as Greek and Shakespearean plays and works by [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Anton Chekhov]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]].

Inspired by the theatrical experiments in the early half of the century and by the horrors of the war, the avant-garde Parisian theatre, "New theatre"—termed the "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]" by critic [[Martin Esslin]] in reference to [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Arthur Adamov]], [[Fernando Arrabal]]—refused simple explanations and abandoned traditional characters, plots and staging. Other experiments in theatre involved decentralisation, regional theatre, "popular theatre" (designed to bring the working class to the theatre), [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] theatre (largely unknown in France before 1954), and the productions of [[Arthur Adamov]] and [[Roger Planchon]]. The Avignon festival was started in 1947 by [[Jean Vilar]], who was also important in the creation of the "[[Théâtre national populaire]]" or T.N.P.

The events of [[May 1968]] marked a watershed in the development of a radical ideology of revolutionary change in education, class, family and literature.  In theatre, the conception of "création collective" developed by [[Ariane Mnouchkine]]'s Théâtre du Soleil refused division into writers, actors and producers: the goal was for total collaboration, for multiple points of view, for an elimination of separation between actors and the public, and for the audience to seek out their own truth.

'''Truck and Tractor pulling''', also known as ''power pulling'', is a motorsport competition, popular in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]] (especially in the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]] and [[Germany]]), [[Australia]] and [[Brazil]], and [[New Zealand]] which requires modified [[tractor]]s to pull a heavy sled along a 35 foot wide, 330 foot long track, with the winner being the tractor that pulls the sled the farthest.  The sport is known as the world's most powerful motorsport, due to the multi-engined modified tractor pullers.

All tractors in their respective classes pull a set weight in the sled. When a tractor gets to the end of the 100 metre track, this is known as a "full pull". When more than one [[tractor]] completes the course, more weight is added to the sled, and those competitors that moved past 300 feet will compete in a pull-off; the winner is the one who can pull the sled the farthest.

The sled is known as a ''weight transfer sled''. This means that as it is pulled down the track, the weight is transferred (linked with gears to the sled’s wheels) from over the rear axles and towards the front of the sled. In front of the rear wheels, there is a "pan". This is essentially a metal plate and as the weight moves over this the resistance builds. The farther the tractor pulls the sled, the more difficult it gets.

The most powerful tractors, such as those in the 4.5 modified class in Europe, can produce over 10,000 horsepower.

{{anchor|History in the USA}}

==History in the US==
Prior to the invention of the tractor, when [[farm implement]]s were pulled by [[horse]]s, farmers would boast about the strength of their teams and seek to compare and contest in teams with one another to see who had the most powerful animals. In some cases they compared horse teams pulling large loads over distance, such as a fully loaded hay [[cart]] or [[wagon]]. In other situations, a flat board or skid would have a horse or team of horses then hitched to it; weight would be added, usually in the form of rocks, and the driver would ask the horses to pull the load, with more weight added and competitors were eliminated; the animals pulling the most weight or for the greatest distance were judged the strongest. These events became the formalized sport of [[horse pulling]], which is still carried out today with specially bred [[draft horses]] bred to have high strength for pulling heavy loads. Today, fixed weights on sleds are dragged for a set distance and additional weight is added in successive rounds. While it is said that the term [[horsepower]] is derived from this event, the concept was developed earlier, in experiments and measurements performed by [[James Watt]] and [[Mason Worrell]].

It wasn't until 1929 that motorized vehicles were put to use in the first events at [[Vaughansville, Missouri]], and [[Bowling Green, Ohio]],{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Although the sport was recognized then, it did not really become popular until the '50s and '60s. It was also realized, at that time, there were no uniform set of rules. The rules varied from [[U.S. state|state]] to state, [[County (United States)|county]] to county, and competitors never knew what standards to follow. This made the sport difficult for new entrants.

In 1969, representatives from eight states congregated to create a uniform book of rules to give the sport the much needed structure, and created the [[National Tractor Pullers Association]] (NTPA). The NTPA's early years were events that used standard farm vehicles, with the motto "Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday". Pulling remained basically the same through the '70s, with only stock and modified tractors. Stock tractors were commercially available tractors produced by manufacturers, and modified tractors were the basic tractor chassis with another non-tractor engine mounted on it.

Tractors remained single engine until two Ohio brothers, Carl and Paul Bosse, introduced the [[Transmission (mechanics)|crossbox]] which could allow multiple engines to be attached to a single [[driveshaft]]. Other innovators during this period included Bruce Hutcherson, with his triple Rodeck engine powered "Makin Bacon Special", Dave and Ralph Banter and their Chevrolet powered tractors, and the "Mission Impossible" tractors of Tim Engler, which at one point had up to seven [[supercharger|blown]] [[Methanol fuel|alcohol]] engines on board.

Subsequently, modified tractors with four engines were common, while stock tractors tried to catch up by adding multiple large [[turbochargers]], along with [[intercooler]]s, but both retained the appearance of a [[tractor]]. Soon tractors became single-use machines that were not used on the farm, making the "Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday" motto obsolete.

Throughout the '70s and '80s the modified division continued to thrill crowds by adding more engines, and soon the tractors lost their tractor appearance and turned into high 'spec' [[drag racing|dragster]]s. The limit was reached in 1988 when a tractor with seven engines was built. As well as [[piston engines]], [[Turboshaft|turbine engines]] (frequently mistakenly called "[[Jet engine|jet engines]]") appeared in 1974, with Gardner Stone's "General" Tractor a four-[[turboshaft]] unit hitting the hook in 1989.

The growing popularity of the sport caused the creation of a new [[four-wheel drive]] [[Division (sport)|division]] in 1976, which captured a large fan base. The engine sizes in these vehicles continued to increase, from 450 cubic inches/7.3 liters up to 700/11.5 and probably would have continued, but the NTPA limited it to 650/10.6 [[naturally aspirated]] and no [[supercharger|blown engine]] in 1989. Today the 4-wheel drive division is one of the most popular with the success of trucks like the Holman Brothers "4-Play" Chevy and Bob Boden's "Studley Studebaker".

===Two-wheel-drive (2WD) truck class===
The [[two-wheel drive]] (2WD) division was introduced in 1983.

The division imposes a weight-limit of 6,200 pounds on each competing truck, a maximum width of eight feet, and a maximum distance of 15 feet from the centerline of the rear axle to the front of the vehicle (including weight racks and tow hook). (The length restriction allows for up to ten inches of cosmetic fiberglass, however.)

Alcohol methane engines with up to eight cylinders are permitted, but diesel engines are not. Any wheelbase is permitted.

The National Tractor Pullers Association restricts engines to 575&amp;nbsp;in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and two valves per cylinder. They permit tubular steel frames. The maximum tire size for the 2WD class is 18.4 x 16.1, with a maximum circumference of 143&amp;nbsp;inches when mounted on an 18-inch-wide rim and inflated to 28&amp;nbsp;psi. The ground patch is not to exceed 19&amp;nbsp;inches on original tread.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Pulling Rules, National Tractor Pullers Association (NTPA), A division of World Pulling International, Inc. (WPI)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Super stock, pro-stock, and mini-modified===
Super Stock Open class uses primarily methanol fuel (some are diesel versions). The Super Stock Open machines can generate over 6,000 horsepower an 4000 ft-lbs of torque, with billet or re-cast engine blocks. Super Stock Open and Super Stock Diesel tractors may use up to four turbochargers in three stages. The Diesel super stock tractors generate close to 5000 hp and 6000 ft-lbs of torque and are allowed to compete in the Open class, which very rarely occurs anymore. However, a true Open (methanol fuel) tractor is not allowed to compete in the Diesel class.

There is light Super Stock class which is 6200 lbs and the Heavy Super Stock Classes that are 8000 - 8250 lbs

Diesel Pro Stock Tractors are limited to one turbocharger and diesel fuel is the only allowable source for power, in keeping with the 'spirit' of the original tractors. The maximum engine displacement is 680 cubic inches.  These engines can achieve 3700 or more horsepower and 5500 ftlbs of tourqe&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntpapull.com/Gregg's%20Releases/St.%20Hyacinthe%202006.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, new classes have been created to appeal to different groups of pullers. There is now a class called Limited Pro Stock that is limited to 640 Cubic inch engine and 4.1" turbocharger. This class typically pulls at 9300 - 9500lbs and is slightly restricted, as opposed to the Pro Stock class, which can run up to 680 cubic inch engine and an unrestricted size [[turbocharger]], along with intercoolers.

The latest addition to Pro Stocks is the Light Pro Stock Class that typically pulls 8300 -8600 lbs depending on location. These tractors are limited to 540 Cubic Inch engines but can run any size turbo. They are not allowed to run intercoolers, however these tractors are making an average of 2500 -2800 horsepower. The light overall weight makes this a driver's class as significant skill is required to keep the tractor on the track.

The mini-modified class is a highly specialized and custom built tractor to be fitted with a naturally aspirated engine, at minimum. NTPA Minis are limited to 575 cubic inches (always an aftermarket V-8 engine block) and uses up to a 14-71 hi helix supercharger. With the driver, they weigh only 2050 pounds. Today's engine is capable of a minimum of 2500 horsepower on methanol or ethanol. Their reputation is known as the wildest ride in pulling, as naturally it is a very high horsepower to weight ratio. Whereas, their larger counterparts, the Modifieds, will weigh 6000, 7500 and 8000 pounds, utilizing the same engine that a Mini has, but, with multiple powerplants per custom built tractor chassis. Usually, a maximum of five engines is all that will make the 8000 pound weight limit.  Nitromethane and oxidizers were outlawed in 1976.

==History in Australia==

[[File:Sheffield Tractor Pull.JPG|thumb|right|Tractor pull at [[Sheffield, Tasmania]]]]
The first Australian Tractor Pull was held at the Elmore Field Days (Victoria) in 1976. The following year saw Tractor Pulling begin in the Victorian rural town of [[Quambatook]].  It has developed over the years into a highly competitive and technical sport, where the difference between first and last place may be as small as one or two metres. Often the top tractors are separated by mere centimetres.
 
The Australian Tractor Pullers Association (ATPA) is a non-profit organisation that governs Tractor Pulling in Australia. Our events (Tractor Pulls) are held in conjunction with a promoter. This is often a local school, sporting, service or community club (for example; Apex, Rotary, Lions, Netball, Cricket, Football) who use the event as a fundraiser. Tractor Pulls are held in locations throughout Australia, predominantly in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. In the west the Western Australian Tractor Pullers Association (WATPA) runs events and is affiliated with the ATPA.
 
The ATPA is focused on actively promoting this spectacular sport and working with communities to not only establish a unique annual event, but more importantly to assist communities financially through the influx of spectators, sponsors and promotion.

The tractors are divided into classes and comply with either "Limited" or "Open" rules. The classes are Open Modified, Super Modified, Limited Modified, Open Mini Modified, Mini Modified, Pro Stock (diesel) and Two Wheel Drive Trucks. The distinction between classes is determined by the overall maximum weight, engine modifications, fuels and physical size.

Competition is open to both women and men, the only restriction being that competitors must at least hold a current Learner Driver’s Permit. It sometimes comes down to members of the same family competing for the trophies.

The Junior Modified Pulling Association conducts an "introductory" class for 8- to 16-year-olds to develop driving, mechanical and competitive skills.  The Modified Mowers pull their own smaller version of the big sled.

==Sled pulling==
[[File:Truck And Tractor Pull Sled 2011 Mackville Nationals.jpg|thumb|right|Sled]]
[[File:Tractor Pull Full pull marker.jpg|thumb|left|Full Pull marker]]
In the early days two main techniques were used. Either a dead weight of fixed mass was dragged, or the step-on method was used, where people stood at fixed positions and stepped aboard as the sled passed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pulling 101 - NTPA Pull|url = http://www.ntpapull.com/pulling-101|website = www.ntpapull.com|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another rule which has now been dropped was that a speed limit should be observed because of injuries resulting from the increased speed at which they boarded. Today's tractors can achieve theoretical speeds over 125&amp;nbsp;mph/200&amp;nbsp;km/h.

Today's sleds use a complex system of gears to move weights up to 65,000 pounds/29,000 kilograms. Upon starting, all the weights are over the sled's rear axles, to give an effective weight of the sled plus zero. As the tractor travels the course, the weights are pushed forward of the sled's axles, pushing the front of the sled into the ground, synthetically creating a gain in weight until the tractor is no longer able to overcome the force of [[friction]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most sleds have grouser bars that act like teeth and dig into the soil to stop the sled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sled|url=http://lcata.com/facts.htm|publisher=Lake Country Antique Tractor Association|accessdate=27 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328055316/http://lcata.com/facts.htm|archivedate=28 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio control (RC) pulling==
[[Radio control]] truck and tractor pulling has been around since the late 1980s.  It was started by a group of people interested in R/C pulling, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US.  The main R/C pulling group is the NR/CTPA. NR/CTPA also has many, smaller, affiliated clubs, such as County Line R/C Puller's Club, club number one in the NR/CTPA.

Apart from modified standard diesel tractors, a variety&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091222202001/http://www.kramp.com/info/index.php?id=2370 Four different tractors of a German team]&lt;/ref&gt; of high power engines are used in tractor pulling, which started in the late 1970s. In the early years, mainly single, double or multiple US-made big block dragster engines were used, but nowadays, a lot of parts from discarded military machinery are in use, like [[Klimov TV3-117]] (Isotov)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isotov.de/steckbriefiso2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[turboshaft]]s from Russian helicopters, Soviet [[Zvezda M503]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiepenkerl-team.com/dragon_fire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726075550/http://www.kiepenkerl-team.com/dragon_fire.htm |archivedate=2010-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; torpedo boat engines, [[Continental AV1790]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kramp.com/info/index.php?id=2371 Kiepenkerl I&amp;II] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091222200908/http://www.kramp.com/info/index.php?id=2371 |date=2009-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; tank engines, or World-War-2-era aircraft piston engines in V12-shape (e.g. [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.greenspirit.info/tractoren.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721203222/http://www.greenspirit.info/tractoren.php |archive-date=2011-07-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) or as [[radial engine]]s (e.g. Curtiss-[[Wright R-3350]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roude-leiw.lu/php/html/specs.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312115523/http://www.roude-leiw.lu/php/html/specs.php |archivedate=2008-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Due to the limited number of vintage [[warbird]] engines remaining, some organisations that own them, such as the [[Fantasy of Flight]] museum in [[Florida]], refuse to sell engines from their collection to customers that wish to use them for tractor pulling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warbirdsandairshows.com/Airshows%202011/polk%20city-2011.htm Warbirds and Airshows - Fantasy of Flight], website retrieved 20 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years a number of agricultural engines have been converted to run on [[methanol]] with multi-stage turbocharging.

'''Ya Sang''' or Yaa Sang ({{lang-th|ยาสั่ง}}) is said to be a form of [[black magic]] performed in Thailand's northeast, [[Isan]].  It is based on traditional knowledge of plant poisons, some causing stomach ailments, physical pain, and intoxication, leading to death.
