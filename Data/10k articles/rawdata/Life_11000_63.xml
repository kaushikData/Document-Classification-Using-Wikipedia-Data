This annual event highlights the principle of non-violence and the worldwide desire for peace.

== History &amp; Background ==

[[Ahimsa]], (The principle of non-violence), is a concept adopted by most Indic traditions, primarily [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] philosophy . The political and social application of Ahimsa was given universal recognition by Mahatma Gandhi who fought the campaign for the independence of India with the doctrine of ahimsa as the cornerstone.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pare, Lexington Books, 2000 "Gandhi, Freedom, and Self-Rule"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ahimsa in Jainism]], is a well-established core principle even before the time of [[Mahavira]], the 24th [[Thirthankara]] in the 5th century BC,.&lt;ref&gt;Goyala, Śrīrāma (1987). "A history of Indian Buddhism". Kusumanjali Prakashan. pp. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[Ahimsa in Jainism]] states that one should do no harm by word, thought or deed, nor ask others to, and nor condone that which is done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaini|first=Padmanbh S|title=The Jaina Path of Purification|year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidas|isbn=8120815785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''assassination of Orlando Letelier''' refers to the September 21, 1976, [[car bomb]]ing, in [[Washington, D.C.]], of [[Orlando Letelier]], a leading opponent of [[Chile]]an dictator Gen. [[Augusto Pinochet]]. Letelier, who was living in [[exile]] in the United States, was killed along with Ronni Karpen Moffitt, who was in the car along with her husband Michael, who worked for Letelier.&lt;ref&gt;John Dinges and Saul Landau, Assassination on Embassy Row&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination was carried out by agents of the Chilean [[secret police]] (the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]]), and was one among many carried out as part of [[Operation Condor]]. Declassified U.S. intelligence documents confirm that Pinochet directly ordered the killing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/08/pinochet-directly-ordered-washington-killing-diplomat-documents-orlando-letelier-declassified Pinochet directly ordered killing on US soil of Chilean diplomat, papers reveal]. ''The Guardian.'' October 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Orlando Letelier, Washingron DC, 1976 (de Marcelo Montecino).jpg|thumb|right|Letelier in 1976.]]
In 1971, Letelier was appointed [[Chile–United States relations|ambassador to the United States]] by [[Salvador Allende]], the socialist [[president of Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCann|2006|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Letelier had lived in Washington, D.C. during the 1960s and had supported Allende's campaign for the presidency. Allende believed Letelier's experience and connections in international banking would be highly beneficial to developing US–Chile diplomatic relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCann|2006|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1973, Letelier served successively as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Chile)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], then [[Ministry of the Interior (Chile)|Interior Minister]], and, finally, [[Ministry of National Defense (Chile)|Defense Minister]]. After the [[Chilean coup of 1973]] that brought [[Augusto Pinochet]] to power, Letelier was one of the first members of the Allende administration to be arrested by the Chilean government and sent to a [[political prison]] in [[Tierra del Fuego]].

He was held for 12 months in different concentration camps suffering severe [[torture]]: first at the Tacna Regiment, then at the Military Academy. Later he was sent to a [[political prison]] for eight months at [[Dawson Island]]. From there he was transferred to the basement of the Air Force War Academy, and finally was sent to the concentration camp of Ritoque. Eventually, international diplomatic pressure especially from [[Diego Arria]], then Governor of Distrito Federal of [[Venezuela]], and [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]]&lt;ref name="Binder"&gt;{{cite news|last=Binder|first=David|title=Opponent of Chilean Junta Slain In Washington by Bomb in His Auto|work=The New York Times|date=September 22, 1976 |quote=His release from prison resulted in large part from intervention by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.|url=http://www.tni.org/detail_page.phtml?page=letelier-docs_220976 |accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in the sudden release of Letelier on the condition that he immediately leave Chile. He was told by the officer in charge of his release that "the arm of [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] is long, General Pinochet will not and does not tolerate activities against his government." This was a clear warning to Letelier that living outside of Chile would not guarantee his safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dinges|Landau|1981|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release in 1974, he moved to Washington, D.C., where he became a senior fellow of the [[Institute for Policy Studies]], an independent international [[policy studies]] [[think tank]].&lt;ref name="McCannp134"&gt;{{Harvnb|McCann|2006|p=134}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He plunged into writing, speaking, and lobbying the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] and European governments against [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s regime, and soon he became the leading voice of the Chilean resistance, in the process preventing several loans (especially from Europe) from being awarded to the military government. He was described by his colleagues as being "the most respected and effective spokesman in the international campaign to condemn and isolate" Pinochet's dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kornbluh|first=Peter|author-link=Peter Kornbluh|title=The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability|year=2004|publisher=[[The New Press]]|location=New York|isbn=1-56584-936-1|oclc=56633246|page=349}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Letelier was assisted at the Institute for Policy Studies by Ronni Moffitt, a 25-year-old fundraiser who ran a "Music Carryout" program that produced musical instruments for the poor, and also campaigned for democracy in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ips-dc.org/about/letelier-moffitt|title=The Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Awards|publisher=[[Institute for Policy Studies]]|accessdate=July 11, 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Letelier soon became a person of interest for [[Operation Condor]], a campaign initiated by [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] dictatorships in South America to [[Intelligence (information gathering)|gather intelligence]] on opposition movements and to assassinate the leaders of these movements. Former General and political figure [[Carlos Prats]], who had become a vocal opponent of the Pinochet government,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1033329.stm|title=Chilean agent convicted over Prats' killing|newspaper=BBC News  |date=November 20, 2000|accessdate=July 11, 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was killed by a radio-controlled [[car bomb]] on September 30, 1974, in an assassination planned and executed by members of DINA.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Nagy-Zekmi|first1=Silvia|last2=Leiva|first2=Fernando|title=Democracy in Chile: The Legacy of September 11, 1973|year=2004|publisher=[[Sussex Academic Press]]|location=Brighton|isbn=1-84519-081-5|oclc=60373757|page=180}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Letelier's pro-democracy campaign and his vehement criticisms of Pinochet had been under watch by the Chilean government. Letelier became a target in DINA director [[Manuel Contreras]]' efforts to eliminate resistance to the Pinochet government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCann|2006|pp=134–135}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1975, Letelier became the Director of Planning and Development for the International Political Economy Programme of the [[Transnational Institute]], an international think tank for [[progressivism|progressive politics]] affiliated with the Institute for Policy Studies. Through the institute's operations in the [[Netherlands]], Letelier convinced the Dutch government not to invest US$63&amp;nbsp;million in the Chilean mining industry.&lt;ref name="Diuguid"&gt;{{citation|last=Diuguid|first=Lewis H.|title=Chile Decree Lifts Citizenship Of Ex-Ambassador Letelier|date=September 16, 1976|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|page=A30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TNI"&gt;{{citation|title=Letelier's Trips to Holland and the Stevin Group Affair |url=http://www.tni.org/article/september-10-1976-decree-was-issued-stripping-orlando-letelier-his-chilean-nationality |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416000229/http://www.tni.org/article/september-10-1976-decree-was-issued-stripping-orlando-letelier-his-chilean-nationality |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 April 2013 |publisher=[[Transnational Institute]] |date=17 November 2005 |accessdate=August 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 1976, the Chilean government revoked Letelier's Chilean citizenship. Pinochet signed a decree declaring that the former ambassador's citizenship be canceled for his interference "with normal financial support to Chile"&lt;ref name="Diuguid"/&gt; and his efforts "to hinder or prevent the investment of Dutch capital in Chile".&lt;ref name="TNI"/&gt; Later that day, in a speech he delivered at the [[Felt Forum]] in [[Madison Square Garden]], Letelier proclaimed:
{{quote|Today Pinochet has signed a decree in which it is said that I am deprived of my nationality. This is an important day for me. A dramatic day in my life in which the action of the fascist generals against me makes me feel more Chilean than ever. Because we are the true Chileans, in the tradition of [[Bernardo O'Higgins|O'Higgins]], [[José Manuel Balmaceda|Balmaceda]], Allende, [[Pablo Neruda|Neruda]], [[Gabriela Mistral]], [[Claudio Arrau]] and [[Victor Jara]], and they—the fascists—are the enemies of Chile, the traitors who are selling our country to foreign investments. I was born a Chilean, I am a Chilean and I will die a Chilean. They were born traitors, they live as traitors and they will be known forever as fascist traitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Transcript of Orlando Letelier's Speech at the Felt Forum, Madison Square Garden on September 10, 1976|url=http://www.tni.org/detail_page.phtml?page=letelier-docs_madison|publisher=[[Transnational Institute]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Orlando Letelier was traveling to work in Washington DC on September 21, 1976, with Ronni Moffitt (January 10, 1951{{snd}}September 21, 1976) and her husband of four months, Michael. Letelier was driving, while Moffitt was in the front passenger seat and Michael was in the rear behind his wife.&lt;ref name="TWP"&gt;{{citation|last1=Lynton|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Meyer|first2=Lawrence|title=Ex-Chilean Ambassador Killed by Bomb Blast|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 22, 1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As they rounded [[Sheridan Circle]] in [[Embassy Row]] at 9:35&amp;nbsp;am [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]], an explosion erupted under the car, lifting it off the ground. When the car came to a halt after colliding with a [[Volkswagen]] illegally parked in front of the [[Embassy of Ireland in Washington, D.C.|Irish Embassy]], Michael was able to escape from the rear end of the car by crawling out of the back window. He then saw his wife stumbling away from the car and, assuming that she was safe, went to assist Letelier, who was still in the driver seat,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; barely conscious and appearing to be in great pain. Letelier's head was rolling back and forth, his eyes moved slightly, and he muttered unintelligibly.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Michael tried to remove Letelier from the car but was unable to do so despite the fact that much of Letelier's lower torso was blown away and his legs had been severed.&lt;ref name="JDinges"&gt;[[John Dinges]]. ''The Condor Years: How Pinochet And His Allies Brought Terrorism To Three Continents.'' [[The New Press]], 2005. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3JjtHROah_YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 7]. {{ISBN|1565849779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Ronni Moffitt and Orlando Letelier were taken to the George Washington University Medical Center shortly thereafter. At the hospital, it was discovered Ronni's [[larynx]] and [[carotid artery]] had been severed by a piece of flying shrapnel.&lt;ref name="JDinges"/&gt; She drowned in her own blood some 30 minutes after Letelier's death,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-14994035 Orlando Letelier: Murdered in central Washington DC]. ''BBC.'' 21 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while Michael suffered only a minor head wound. Michael estimated the bomb was detonated at approximately 9:30&amp;nbsp;am; the medical examiner report set the time of  Letelier's death at 9:50&amp;nbsp;am and Moffitt's at 10:37&amp;nbsp;am, the cause of death for both listed as explosion-incurred injuries due to a [[car bomb]] placed under the car on the driver's side.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Investigation and prosecution==
[[File:Orlando Letelier &amp; Ronni K Moffit Memorial 28375046.jpg|thumb|right|Letelier and Moffitt Memorial on Sheridan Circle, Washington D.C.]]
Investigators initially determined that the explosion was caused by a plastic bomb, molded to concentrate the force of its blast into the driver seat. The bomb was attached by wires or magnets to the car's underside and blew a "circular hole, 2 to 2½ feet in diameter" in the driver's seat.&lt;ref name="TWP"/&gt; The bomb was not believed to have been controlled by a timing device or a remote-controlled detonator.&lt;ref name="TWP"/&gt;

In the days after the incident, spokespersons for the [[United States Department of State]] said the department "expresses its gravest concern about Dr. Orlando Letelier's death".&lt;ref name="Binder"/&gt; Due to the assassination of Prats and the [[Leighton case|attempted assassination]] of [[Bernardo Leighton]], the incident was believed to have been the latest of a series of state-sponsored assassination attempts against Chilean political exiles.&lt;ref name="Binder"/&gt; A spokesman for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) said that this was the first incident of violence against Chilean exiles on American soil, according to agency records.&lt;ref name="Binder"/&gt;

The FBI eventually uncovered evidence that [[Michael Townley]], a [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] US expatriate, had organized the assassination of Orlando Letelier on behalf of Chile. Townley and [[Armando Fernandez Larios]], who was also implicated in the murder, had been given [[visa (document)|visas]] to enter the United States.

In 1978, Chile agreed to turn Townley over to the United States, where he began to testify extensively. Townley pleaded guilty and confessed that he had contacted five anti-Castro Cuban exiles to help him booby-trap Letelier's car. According to [[Jean-Guy Allard]], after consultations with the [[Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations|Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations (CORU)]] leadership, including [[Luis Posada Carriles]] and [[Orlando Bosch]], those elected to carry out the murder were Cuban-Americans José Dionisio Suárez Esquivel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/dionisio.htm|title=Jose Dionisio Suarez Esquivel|first=Antonio de la|last=Cova|publisher=|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virgilio Paz Romero]], Alvin Ross Díaz, and brothers Guillermo and [[Ignacio Novo Sampoll]][http://www.counterpunch.org/landau08202005.html][https://web.archive.org/web/20060612222833/http://www.granma.cu/ingles/mar03/mier26/12posada.html] . According to the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', [[Luis Posada Carriles]] was at this meeting, which formalized details that led to Letelier's death and also the ''[[Cubana Flight 455|Cubana]]'' bombing two weeks later. Townley also agreed to provide evidence against these men in exchange for a deal that involved his pleading guilty to a single charge of conspiracy to commit murder and being given a ten-year sentence. His wife, [[Mariana Callejas]], also agreed to testify in exchange for not being prosecuted.

On January 9, 1979, the trial of the Novo Sampoll brothers and Díaz began in Washington. All three were found guilty of murder. Guillermo Novo and Díaz were sentenced to life imprisonment. Ignacio Novo received eight years. However the three were acquitted at a new trial. Townley served about half of a 10-year sentence and was freed under the Witness Protection Program. Dionisio Suarez and Virgilio Paz remained fugitives until they were apprehended in the 1990s. They pleaded guilty and served short sentences.

In 1987, Larios fled Chile with the assistance of the FBI, claiming he feared that Pinochet was planning to kill him because he refused to co-operate in cover-up activities related to the Letelier murder. On February 4, 1987, Larios pleaded guilty to one count of acting as an accessory to the murder. In exchange for the plea and information about the plot, the authorities dropped the charges.

Several other people were also [[prosecute]]d and [[conviction (law)|convict]]ed for the murder. Among them were General [[Manuel Contreras]], former head of the DINA, and Brigadier [[Pedro Espinoza Bravo]], also formerly of the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]]. Contreras and Espinoza were convicted in Chile on November 12, 1993, and sentenced to seven and six years of prison respectively.

In 2000, 16,000 documents that were previously secret were released by various United States government departments and agencies as part of an effort to declassify materials related to political violence and  [[military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)#Human-rights violations|human rights violations from the late 1960s to early 1990s in Chile]].&lt;ref name="The Washington Post; November 14, 2000"&gt;{{cite news |last=Loeb |first=Vernon |author-link=Vernon Loeb |date=November 14, 2000 |title=Documents Link Chile's Pinochet to Letelier Murder |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/11/14/documents-link-chiles-pinochet-to-letelier-murder/280ce1de-d533-4c2b-9a01-37ab93db25d2/ |newspaper=The Washington Post |location= |page=A16&lt;!-- page number taken on faith from previous citation not linked to webpage --&gt; |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[United States Department of State]], Pinochet called fellow right-wing dictator, Paraguayan General [[Alfredo Stroessner]], in 1976 and requested that Townley and Fernandez Larios received passports with phony names.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post; November 14, 2000"/&gt; Almost immediately after stamping the visas, State Department officials realized the passports had been falsely obtained and canceled the visas; however, Townley and Fernandez Larios were able to enter the US in August 1976.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post; November 14, 2000"/&gt;

Pinochet, who died on December 10, 2006, was never charged in relation to this case. Orlando Letelier's son, representative Juan Pablo Letelier, gave this testimony: "What I have said once and again because I was taught to say the truth is that there is no evidence whatsoever from the thousands of pages of the process that may allow to affirm that there was participation of the Chilean Army nor of its Commander in Chief (General Pinochet) in the assassination of Orlando Letelier" (El Mercurio, June 4, 1995).

==Allegations of U.S. knowledge==
According to [[John Dinges]], author of ''The Condor Years (The New Press 2003)'', documents released in 2015 revealed a CIA report dated April 28, 1978 that showed the agency by then had knowledge that Pinochet ordered the murders.&lt;ref name=ippppppoint /&gt;  The report stated “Contreras told a confidant he authorized the assassination of Letelier on orders from Pinochet."&lt;ref name=ippppppoint&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/10/30/bombshell-pinochets-guilt-delivered-too-late-383121.html|title=A Bombshell on Pinochet’s Guilt, Delivered Too Late|first=John Dinges On 10/14/15 at 11:23|last=AM|date=October 14, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A State Department document also referred to eight separate CIA reports from around the same date, each sourced to “extremely sensitive informants” who provided evidence of Pinochet’s direct involvement in ordering the assassination and in directing the subsequent cover-up.&lt;ref name=ippppppoint /&gt; FBI Carter Cornick, an FBI special agent credited with solving the case with his partner Robert Scherrer, said that the information was [[hearsay]] gathered from people who might provide the CIA with information but would never appear in court.&lt;ref name=ippppppoint /&gt;

When Townley and his Chilean associate tried to obtain B-2 visas to the United States in Paraguay, Landau was told by Paraguayan intelligence that these Paraguayan subjects were to meet with General [[Vernon A. Walters]] in the United States, concerning CIA business. Landau was suspicious of this declaration, and cabled for more information. The B-2 visas were revoked by the State Department on August 9, 1976.&lt;ref name="00008C9F"&gt;{{cite web| title = Issuance of Visas| url = http://foia.state.gov/documents/StateChile3/00008C9F.pdf| format = PDF| author=U.S State Department| date = 1976-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the same names, two DINA agents used fraudulent Chilean passports to travel to the U.S. on diplomatic A-2 visas, in order to shadow Letelier.&lt;ref name="00008C9F"/&gt;&lt;ref name="00008CA0"&gt;{{cite web| title = Visas to Enter United States under False Pretenses| url = http://foia.state.gov/documents/StateChile3/00008CA0.pdf| format = PDF| author=U.S State Department| date = 1976-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Townley himself flew to the U.S. on a fraudulent Chilean passport and under another assumed name. Landau had made copies of the visa applications though, which later documented the relationship of Townley and DINA with the Paraguayan visa applications.

According to Dinges, documents released in 1999 and 2000 establish that "the [[CIA]] had inside intelligence about the assassination alliance at least two months before Letelier was killed, but failed to act to stop the plans." The intelligence was about Condor's plans to kill prominent exiles outside of Latin America, but did not specify Letelier was the target. It also knew about an [[Uruguay]]an attempt to kill U.S. Congressman [[Edward Koch]], which then-CIA director [[George H.W. Bush]] warned him about only after Orlando Letelier's murder [http://www.johndinges.com/condor/revelations.htm] .

[[Kenneth Maxwell]] points out that U.S. policymakers were aware not only of Operation Condor in general, but in particular "that a Chilean assassination team had been planning to enter the United States." A month before the Letelier assassination, [[Henry Kissinger|Kissinger]] ordered "that the Latin American rulers involved be informed that the 'assassination of subversives, politicians and prominent figures both within the national borders of certain Southern Cone countries and abroad ... would create a most serious moral and political problem." Maxwell wrote in his review of [[Peter Kornbluh]]'s book, "This demarche was apparently not delivered: the U.S. embassy in Santiago demurred on the ground that to deliver such a strong rebuke would upset the dictator", and that, on September 20, 1976, the day before Letelier and Moffitt were killed, the State Department instructed the ambassadors to take no further action with regard to the Condor scheme. [Maxwell, 2004, 18].

On April 10, 2010, the [[Associated Press]] reported that a document discovered by the [[National Security Archive]] indicated that the State Department communique that was supposed to have gone out to the Chilean government warning against the assassinations had been blocked by then Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cable Ties Kissinger to Chile Scandal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/04/10/us/AP-US-Kissinger-Chile.html?_r=1&amp;hp |quote= As secretary of state, Henry Kissinger canceled a U.S. warning against carrying out international political assassinations that was to have gone to Chile and two neighboring nations just days before a former ambassador was killed by Chilean agents on Washington's Embassy Row in 1976, a newly released State Department cable shows. |work=[[Associated Press]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=April 10, 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-10 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[FBI]] investigation into the assassination, documents in Letelier's possession were copied and leaked to journalists [[Rowland Evans]] and [[Robert Novak]] of the ''[[Washington Times]]'' and [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] by the [[FBI]] before being returned to his widow.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Lescaze. “Letelier Briefcase Opened to Press”, The Washington Post. Feb 17, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The documents purportedly show Letelier was working with Eastern Block Intelligence agencies for a decade  iand coordinating his activities with the surviving political leadership of the  [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity coalition]] exiled in [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] and Les Whitten. “Letelier's 'Havana Connection' ”, The Washington Post, Dec 20, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI suspected that these individuals had been recruited by the [[Stasi]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[Robert Moss]], The Letelier Papers. Foreign Report; March 22, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Documents in the briefcase showed that Letelier had maintained contact with Salvador Allende’s daughter, [[Beatriz Allende]] who was married to [[Cuba]]n [[Dirección de Inteligencia|DGI]] station chief Luis Fernandez Ona.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[Roland Evans]] and [[Robert Novak]], Letelier Political Fund. [[The Washington Post]]; February 16, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The documents showed Letelier was receive $5,000 a month from the Cuban government and under the supervision of Beatriz Allende, he used his contacts within the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] (IPS),&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] and Les Whitten. “Letelier's 'Havana Connection'”, The Washington Post, Dec 20, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; and western human rights groups to organize a campaign within the [[United Nations]] as well as the US Congress to isolate the new Chilean government&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This organized pressure on Pinochet’s government was allegedly closely coordinated by the Cuban and Soviet governments, perhaps using individuals like Letelier to implement these efforts. Letelier's briefcase also contained his address book containing the names of dozens of known and suspected [[East Block]] intelligence agents. Correspondence between Letelier and individuals in Cuba had been handled via Julian Rizo, who used his diplomatic status to hide his activities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Evans]] and [[Robert Novak]], Behind the Murder of Letelier. [[Indianapolis News]]; March 1, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow IPS member and friend [[Saul Landau]] described Evans and Novak as part of an “organized right wing attack”. In 1980, Letelier's widow, Isabel, wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the money sent to her late husband from Cuba was from western sources, and that Cuba had simply acted as an intermediary,&lt;ref&gt;[[Isabel Landau|Isabel]],, The Revival of Old Lies about Orlando Letelier. [[The New York Times]]; November 8, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; although Novak and Evans point out that the document from Beatriz Allende were very clear on the source of the money.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
British film director [[Alan Clarke]] was in the pre-production stages of making the story into a film titled ''Assassination on Embassy Row''. Whilst putting the film together in the US, Clarke was diagnosed with lung cancer and returned to the United Kingdom. Following Clarke's death in 1990, the project was shelved.

A minor character in the 1983 film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', Dr. Orlando Gutiérrez, was based on Letelier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scarface: The Ultimate Guide|last=Stevenson|first=Damian|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2015|isbn=132930523X|location=|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutiérrez is a Bolivian investigative journalist who intends to expose the ties between the corrupt Bolivian military dictatorship and drug lord Alejandro Sosa (based on [[Roberto Suárez Goméz]]). [[Tony Montana]] and one of Sosa's henchmen plant a bomb in Gutiérrez' car, planning to detonate it in front of the United Nations Building in New York, but Montana changes his mind at the last minute and kills the henchman.

The 1986 novel ''[[Waking the Dead (novel)|Waking the Dead]]'' (which was [[Waking the Dead (film)|adapted into film]] in 2000) includes a car bomb placed on American soil by Chilean operatives.

Used in a number of sciences, ranging from [[econometrics]] to [[meteorology]], '''consensus forecasts''' are predictions of the future that are created by combining together several separate forecasts which have often been created using different methodologies. Also known as ''combining forecasts'', ''forecast averaging'' or ''model averaging'' (in [[econometrics]] and [[statistics]]) and [[Committee machine|''committee machines'']], ''[[ensemble averaging]]'' or ''expert aggregation'' (in [[machine learning]]). Applications can range from forecasting the weather to predicting the annual [[Gross Domestic Product]] of a country or the number of cars a company or an individual dealer is likely to sell in a year. While forecasts are often made for future values of a [[time series]], they can also be for one-off events such as the outcome of a presidential election or a football match.

==Background==
[[Forecasting]] plays a key role in any organisation's planning process as it provides insight into uncertainty. Through simulation, one will be able to assess whether proposed strategies are likely to produce the desired objectives within predefined limits. In the field of [[economic forecasting]], the future path of the economy is intrinsic to almost every company's business outlook, and hence there is considerable demand for accurate economic forecasts. Matching this strong demand is the large volume of readily available forecast information from governments, international agencies and various private firms. Companies such as [http://www.consensuseconomics.com Consensus Economics] and [[Blue Chip Economic Indicators]] specialise in publishing economic forecast data, with the former covering most major regions of the world and the latter focusing on the US economy. However, deciphering the best forecast method is no easy task, and largely depends on the objectives of the user and the constraints they are likely to face. Rather than try to identify a single best forecasting method, an alternative approach is to combine the results from independent forecasters and take an average of the forecasts.

This method of taking a simple [[arithmetic mean|mean average]] of a panel of independent forecasts, derived from different [[Forecasting#Categories of forecasting methods|forecasting methods]], is known as combining forecasts and the result is often referred to as a consensus forecast. Unless a particular forecast model which produces smaller [[forecast error]]s compared to other individual forecasts can be identified, adopting the consensus approach can be beneficial due to diversification gains. Combining economic forecasts is well established in many countries and can count central banks, government institutions and businesses among the users. In recent decades, consensus forecasts have attracted much interest, backed by the publication of a huge swathe of academic research on forecast accuracy. [[Empirical studies]] show that pooling forecasts increased forecast accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Combining forecasts: A review and annotated bibliography|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0169207089900125|journal = International Journal of Forecasting|date = 1989|pages = 559–583|volume = 5|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/0169-2070(89)90012-5|first = Robert T.|last = Clemen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Marten |last=Blix |first2=Joachim |last2=Wadefjord |first3=Ulrika |last3=Wienecke |first4=Martin |last4=Adahl |year=2001 |title=How good is the forecasting performance of major institutions? |journal=Economic Review |volume=3/2001 |issue= |pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chapter 4 Forecast Combinations|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574070605010049|publisher = Elsevier|date = 2006|pages = 135–196|volume = 1|doi = 10.1016/s1574-0706(05)01004-9|first = Allan|last = Timmermann|editor-first = C. W. J. Granger and A. Timmermann|editor-last = G. Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the advantages of using consensus forecasts is that it can prove useful if there is a high degree of uncertainty or risk attached to the situation and the selection of the most accurate forecast in advance is difficult. Even if one method is identified as the best, combining is still worthwhile if other methods can make some positive contribution to the forecast accuracy. Moreover, many factors can affect the independent forecast and these, along with any additional useful information, might be captured by using the consensus approach. Another argument in favour of this method is that individual forecasts may be subject to numerous [[Cognitive bias|behavioural biases]], but these can be minimised by combining independent forecasts together. Hence, combining is seen as helping to improve forecast accuracy by reducing the forecast errors of individual forecasts. Furthermore, averaging forecasts is likely to be more useful when the data and the forecasting techniques that the component forecasts are drawn from differ substantially. And even though it is only a simple approach (typically an unweighted mean average), this method is just as useful as other more sophisticated models. Indeed, more recent studies in the past decade have shown that, over time, the equal weights combined forecast is usually more accurate than the individual forecast which make up the consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Makridakis |last2=Hibon |year=2000 |title=The M3-Competition: Results, Conclusions and Implications |journal=International Journal of Forecasting |volume=16 |issue= |pages=451–476 |doi=10.1016/s0169-2070(00)00057-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McNees |first=Stephen K. |date=November 1987 |title=Consensus Forecasts: Tyranny of the Majority |journal=New England Economic Review   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Golinelli |first2=G. |last2=Parigi |year=2008 |title=Real-Time Squared: A Real-Time Data Set for Real-Time GDP Forecasting |journal=International Journal of Forecasting |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=368–385 |doi= 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2008.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sum, the usefulness of the consensus forecast technique has been supported by a wealth of empirical studies in recent decades. The use of equal weights in the combining method is appealing because of its simplicity and is easy to describe. Among others, this simple method of averaging the forecasts of individual forecasters has been put into practice by many of the world's central banks as they try to gauge expectations in the private sector. &lt;!-- Examples of consensus forecasts can be found at Consensus Economics Inc. and FocusEconomics, which publish simple mean averages of economists’ forecasts. --&gt; An empirical study carried out by [[Roy Batchelor]] in 2000 demonstrates greater accuracy in the consensus forecasts over macroeconomic projections produced by leading multinational agencies such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Roy |last=Batchelor |title=The IMF and OECD versus Consensus Forecasts |year=2000 |journal=Applied Economics |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=225–235 |doi= 10.1080/00036840121785}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Robert C. Jones found: "At least since the publication of “The Combination of Forecasts” (Bates and Granger [1969]), economists have known that combining forecasts from different sources can both improve accuracy and reduce forecaster error. In the intervening years, numerous studies have confirmed these conclusions, outlined conditions under which forecast combinations are most effective, and tried to explain why simple equal weights work so well relative to more sophisticated statistical techniques.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert C. |last=Jones |title=Making Better Investment Decisions |year=2014 |journal=The Journal of Portfolio Management |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=128–143 |doi= 10.3905/jpm.2014.40.2.128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Probabilistic forecasts ==
Although the literature on the combination of point forecasts is very rich, the topic of combining [[Probabilistic forecasting|probabilistic forecasts]] is not so popular.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are very few papers that deal explicitly with the combination of [[Prediction interval|interval forecasts]], however, there has been some progress in the area of density forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Combining Density and Interval Forecasts: A Modest Proposal*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0084.2005.00148.x/abstract|journal = Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics|date = 2005|issn = 1468-0084|pages = 983–994|volume = 67|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0084.2005.00148.x|first = Kenneth F.|last = Wallis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evaluating density forecasts: forecast combinations, model mixtures, calibration and sharpness|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.1192/abstract|journal = Journal of Applied Econometrics|date = 2011|issn = 1099-1255|pages = 1023–1040|volume = 26|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/jae.1192|first = James|last = Mitchell|first2 = Kenneth F.|last2 = Wallis}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple, yet powerful alternative technique has been introduced in the context of electricity price forecasting. [[Quantile regression averaging|Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA)]] involves applying [[quantile regression]] to the point forecasts of a number of individual forecasting models or experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computing electricity spot price prediction intervals using quantile regression and forecast averaging|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00180-014-0523-0|journal = Computational Statistics|date = 2015|issn = 0943-4062|pages = 791–803|volume = 30|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s00180-014-0523-0|first = Jakub|last = Nowotarski|first2 = Rafał|last2 = Weron|others = [Open Access]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found to perform extremely well in practice - the top two performing teams in the ''price track'' of the [[Global Energy Forecasting Competition]] (GEFCom2014) used variants of QRA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9384">'''Contextual image classification''', a topic of [[pattern recognition]] in [[computer vision]], is an approach of [[Classification in machine learning|classification]] based on contextual information in images. "Contextual" means this approach is focusing on the relationship of the nearby pixels, which is also called neighbourhood. The goal of this approach is to classify the images by using the contextual information.

== Introduction ==
Similar as [[Natural language processing|processing language]], a single word may have multiple meanings unless the context is provided, and the patterns within the sentences are the only informative segments we care about. For images, the principle is same. Find out the patterns and associate proper meanings to them.

As the image illustrated below, if only a small portion of the image is shown, it is very difficult to tell what the image is about.
[[File:01 mouth.png|center|Mouth]]

Even try another portion of the image, it is still difficult to classify the image.
[[File:02 left eye.png|center|Left eye]]

However, if we increase the contextual of the image, then it makes more sense to recognize.
[[File:03 increased image of smiling face.png|center|thumb|Increased field of smiling face]]

As the full images shows below, almost everyone can classify it easily.
[[File:Full image.png|center|thumb|Full image]]

During the procedure of [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]], the methods which do not use the contextual information are sensitive to noise and variations, thus the result of segmentation will contain a great deal of misclassified regions, and often these regions are small (e.g., one pixel).

Compared to other techniques, this approach is robust to noise and substantial variations for it takes the continuity of the segments into account.

Several methods of this approach will be described below.

== Applications ==

=== Functioning as a post-processing filter to a labelled image ===
This approach is very effective against small regions caused by noise. And these small regions are usually formed by few pixels or one pixel. The most probable label is assigned to these regions.
However, there is a drawback of this method. The small regions also can be formed by correct regions rather than noise, and in this case the method is actually making the classification worse.
This approach is widely used in [[remote sensing]] applications.

=== Improving the post-processing classification ===
This is a two-stage classification process:
# For each pixel, label the pixel and form a new feature vector for it.
# Use the new feature vector and combine the contextual information to assign the final label to the

=== Merging the pixels in earlier stages ===
Instead of using single pixels, the neighbour pixels can be merged into homogeneous regions benefiting from contextual information. And provide these regions to classifier.

=== Acquiring pixel feature from neighbourhood ===
The original spectral data can be enriched by adding the contextual information carried by the neighbour pixels, or even replaced in some occasions. This kind of pre-processing methods are widely used in [[Image texture|textured image]] recognition. The typical approaches include mean values, variances, texture description, etc.

=== Combining spectral and spatial information ===
The classifier uses the grey level and pixel neighbourhood (contextual information) to assign labels to pixels. In such case the information is a combination of spectral and spatial information.

=== Powered by the Bayes minimum error classifier ===
Contextual classification of image data is based on the Bayes minimum error classifier (also known as a [[naive Bayes classifier]]).

'''Present the pixel''':
*A pixel is denoted as &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.
*The neighbourhood of each pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a vector and denoted as &lt;math&gt;N(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.
**The values in the neighbourhood vector is denoted as &lt;math&gt;f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;.
**Each pixel is presented by the vector
:::&lt;math&gt;\xi = \left ( f(x_0), f(x_1), \ldots, f(x_k) \right )&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;x_i \in N(x_0); \quad i = 1, \ldots, k&lt;/math&gt;

*The labels (classification) of pixels in the neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;N(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; are presented as a vector
::&lt;math&gt;\eta = \left ( \theta_0, \theta_1, \ldots, \theta_k \right )&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\theta_i \in \left \{ \omega_0, \omega_1, \ldots, \omega_k \right \}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\omega_s&lt;/math&gt; here denotes the assigned class.

*A vector presents the labels in the neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;N(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; without the pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\hat \eta = \left ( \theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_k \right )&lt;/math&gt;

'''The neighbourhood''':
Size of the neighbourhood. There is no limitation of the size, but it is considered to be relatively small for each pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.
A reasonable size of neighbourhood would be &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; of 4-[[Connectedness|connectivity]] or 8-connectivity (&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is marked as red and placed in the centre).
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Square_4_connectivity.svg|[[4-connected graph|4-connectivity]] neighbourhood,&amp;nbsp;
Image:Square_8_connectivity.svg|[[8-connectivity]] neighbourhood
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''The calculation''':

Apply the minimum error classification on a pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, if the probability of a class &lt;math&gt;\omega_r&lt;/math&gt; being presenting the pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is the highest among all, then assign &lt;math&gt;\omega_r&lt;/math&gt; as its class.

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_0 = \omega_r \quad\text{ if }\quad P(\omega_r\mid f(x_0)) = \max_{s=1,2,\ldots,R} P(\omega_s\mid f(x_0)) &lt;/math&gt;

The contextual classification rule is described as below, it uses the feature vector &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_0 = \omega_r \quad\text{ if }\quad P(\omega_r\mid\xi) = \max_{s=1,2,\ldots,R} P(\omega_s\mid\xi) &lt;/math&gt;

Use the Bayes formula to calculate the posteriori probability  &lt;math&gt;P(\omega_s\mid\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P(\omega_s\mid\xi) = \frac{p(\xi\mid\omega_s)P(\omega_s)}{p \left ( \xi \right )}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of vectors is the same as the number of pixels in the image. For the classifier uses a vector corresponding to each pixel &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the vector is generated from the pixel's neighbourhood.

'''The basic steps of contextual image classification''':
#Calculate the feature vector &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; for each pixel.
#Calculate the parameters of probability distribution &lt;math&gt;p ( \xi\mid\omega_s )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P ( \omega_s )&lt;/math&gt;
#Calculate the posterior probabilities &lt;math&gt;P(\omega_r\mid\xi)&lt;/math&gt; and all labels &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt;. Get the image classification result.

== Algorithms ==

=== Template matching ===
The [[template matching]] is a "brute force" implementation of this approach.&lt;ref&gt;G.T. Toussaint, "The Use of Context in Pattern Recognition," Pattern Recognition, vol. 10, 1977,  pp. 189–204.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is first create a set of templates, and then look for small parts in the image match with a template.

This method is computationally high and inefficient. It keeps an entire templates list during the whole process and the number of combinations is extremely high. For a &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; pixel image, there could be a maximum of &lt;math&gt;2^{m \times n}&lt;/math&gt; combinations, which leads to high computation. This method is a top down method and often called [[Lookup table|table look-up]] or [[Data dictionary|dictionary look-up]].

=== Lower-order Markov chain ===

The [[Markov chain]]&lt;ref&gt;K. Abend, T.J. Harley, and L.N. Kanal, "Classification of Binary Random Patterns," IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 11, no. 4, October 1965, pp. 538–544.&lt;/ref&gt; also can be applied in pattern recognition. The pixels in an image can be recognised as a set of random variables, then use the lower order Markov chain to find the relationship among the pixels. The image is treated as a virtual line, and the method uses conditional probability.

=== Hilbert space-filling curves ===

The [[Hilbert curve]] runs in a unique pattern through the whole image, it traverses every pixel without visiting any of them twice and keeps a continuous curve. It is fast and efficient.

=== Markov meshes ===

The lower-order Markov chain and Hilbert space-filling curves mentioned above are treating the image as a line structure. The Markov meshes however will take the two dimensional information into account.

=== Dependency tree ===

The [[Chow–Liu tree|dependency tree]]&lt;ref&gt;C.K. Chow and C.N. Liu, "Approximating Discrete Probability Distributions with Dependence Trees," IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol.14, no. 3, May 1965, pp. 462–467.&lt;/ref&gt; is a method using tree dependency to approximate probability distributions.

'''Couvelaire uterus''' (also known as '''uteroplacental apoplexy''')&lt;ref name="pmid9313351"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hubbard JL, Hosmer SB |title=Couvelaire uterus |journal=J Am Osteopath Assoc |volume=97 |issue=9 |pages=536–7 |date=September 1997 |pmid=9313351 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a life-threatening condition in which loosening of the placenta ([[abruptio placentae]]) causes bleeding that penetrates into the uterine [[myometrium]] forcing its way into the [[peritoneal cavity]].

==Symptoms and signs==
Patients can have pain secondary to uterine contractions, uterine tetany or localized uterine tenderness. Signs can also be due to abruptio placentae including uterine hypertonus, fetal distress, fetal death, and rarely, [[hypovolemic shock]] (shock secondary to severe blood loss). The uterus may adopt a bluish/purplish, mottled appearance due to extravasation of blood into uterine muscle.

==Pathophysiology==
Couvelaire uterus is a phenomenon wherein the retroplacental blood may penetrate through the thickness of the wall of the uterus into the peritoneal cavity.  This may occur after abruptio placentae.  The hemorrhage that gets into the decidua basalis ultimately splits the decidua, and the haematoma may remain within the decidua or may extravasate into the [[myometrium]] (the muscular wall of the uterus).  The myometrium becomes weakened and may rupture due to the increase in intrauterine pressure associated with uterine contractions. This may lead to a life-threatening obstetric emergency requiring urgent delivery of the fetus.

==Prevention==
The occurrence of couvelaire uterus can be prevented by prevention of abruptio placentae.  This include proper management of hypertensive states of pregnancy; treatment of maternal diseases like diabetes mellitus, and other collagen disease complicating pregnancy; prevention of trauma during pregnancy; mothers should also avoid smoking or consumption of alcohol during pregnancy.

==Treatment==
The uterus should be evacuated and contractions should be stimulated using intravenous oxytocin; hysterectomy (the removal of the uterus) may be needed in some cases.

==Prognosis==
The foetus may be compromised if there is prolonged delivery because of the non-contractile uterus; severe bleeding may cause hypovolemic shock in the mother.

In the [[philosophy of mind]], '''emergent''' (or '''emergentist''') '''materialism''' is a theory which asserts that the [[mind]] is an irreducible existent in some sense, albeit not in the sense of being an [[ontology|ontological]] simple, and that the study of [[mental event|mental phenomena]] is independent of other sciences.

The view can be divided into emergence which denies [[mental causation]] and emergence which allows for causal effect.  A version of the latter type has been advocated by [[John R. Searle]], called [[biological naturalism]].  
  
The other main group of materialist views in the philosophy of mind can be labeled non-emergent (or non-emergentist) materialism, and includes [[Type physicalism|identity theory (reductive materialism)]], philosophical [[behaviorism]], [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], and [[eliminative materialism|eliminativism (eliminative materialism)]].

'''Existential nihilism''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] theory that [[life]] has no intrinsic [[meaning (existential)|meaning]] or [[value (ethics)|value]]. With respect to the universe, existential nihilism suggests that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. According to the theory, each individual is an isolated being born into the universe, barred from knowing "why", yet compelled to invent meaning.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/#H3 |title=Nihilism |author=Alan Pratt |date=April 23, 2001 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Embry-Riddle University |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inherent meaninglessness of life is largely explored in the philosophical school of [[existentialism]], where one can potentially create their own subjective "meaning" or "purpose". Of all types of [[nihilism]], existential nihilism has received the most literary and philosophical attention.&lt;ref name="cosmos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/257/379 |title=
Nihilism, Nature, and the Collapse of the Cosmos |author=David Storey |date=2011 |work=Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of life==
The idea that meaning and values are without foundation is a form of [[nihilism]], and the existential response to that idea is noting that meaning is not "a matter of contemplative theory," but instead, "a consequence of engagement and commitment."

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] wrote in his essay ''[[Existentialism and Humanism]]'', "What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards. If man as the existentialist sees him as not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing. He will not be anything until later, and then he will be what he makes of himself." Here it is made clear what is meant by Existentialists when they say meaning is "a consequence of engagement and commitment".

The theory purports to describe the human situation to create a life outlook and create meaning, which has been summarized as, "Strut, fret, and delude ourselves as we may, our lives are of no significance, and it is futile to seek or to affirm meaning where none can be found."&lt;ref name="crosby"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=9VnPgFiW0CIC&amp;oi |title=The Specter of the Absurd: Sources and Criticisms of Modern Nihilism |author=Donald A. Crosby |date=July 1, 1988 |publisher=State University of New York Press |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existential nihilists claim that, to be honest, one must face the [[absurdism|absurdity]] of existence, that he/she will eventually die, and that both [[religion]] and [[metaphysics]] are simply results of the fear of death.&lt;ref name="cosmos"/&gt;

According to [[Donald A. Crosby]], "There is no justification for life, but also no reason not to live. Those who claim to find meaning in their lives are either dishonest or deluded. In either case, they fail to face up to the harsh reality of the human situations".&lt;ref name="crosby"/&gt;

==History==
Existential nihilism has been a part of the Western intellectual tradition since the [[Cyrenaics]], such as [[Hegesias of Cyrene]]. During the Renaissance, [[William Shakespeare]] eloquently summarized the existential nihilist's perspective through Macbeth's mindset in the end of [[Macbeth|the eponymous play]]. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] further expanded on these ideas, and Nietzsche, particularly, has become a major figure in existential nihilism.

The [[Atheistic existentialism|atheistic existentialist]] movement spread in 1940s France. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' discussed the topic. Camus wrote further works, such as ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]'', ''[[The Plague]]'', ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]'' and ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''.&lt;ref name="iep"/&gt; Other figures include [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. In addition, [[Ernest Becker|Ernest Becker's]] Pulitzer Prize winning life's work ''[[The Denial of Death]]'' is a collection of thoughts on existential nihilism.

{{quote|The common thread in the literature of the existentialists is coping with the emotional anguish arising from our confrontation with nothingness, and they expended great energy responding to the question of whether surviving it was possible. Their answer was a qualified "Yes," advocating a formula of passionate commitment and [[Apatheia|impassive stoicism]].|[[Alan Pratt]]&lt;ref name="iep"/&gt;}}

In [[computer programming]], '''gene expression programming (GEP)''' is an [[evolutionary algorithm]] that creates computer programs or models. These computer programs are complex [[tree structure]]s that learn and adapt by changing their sizes, shapes, and composition, much like a living organism. And like living organisms, the computer programs of GEP are also encoded in simple linear [[chromosome]]s of fixed length. Thus, GEP is a [[Genotype–phenotype distinction|genotype–phenotype system]], benefiting from a simple [[genotype|genome]] to keep and transmit the genetic information and a complex [[phenotype]] to explore the environment and adapt to it.

==Background==
[[Evolutionary algorithms]] use populations of individuals, select individuals according to fitness, and introduce genetic variation using one or more [[genetic operators]]. Their use in artificial computational systems dates back to the 1950s where they were used to solve optimization problems (e.g. Box 1957&lt;ref&gt;Box, G. E. P., 1957. Evolutionary operation: A method for increasing industrial productivity. Applied Statistics, 6, 81–101.&lt;/ref&gt; and Friedman 1959&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, G. J., 1959. Digital simulation of an evolutionary process. General Systems Yearbook, 4, 171–184.&lt;/ref&gt;). But it was with the introduction of [[evolution strategies]] by Rechenberg in 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rechenberg|first=Ingo|year=1973|title=Evolutionsstrategie|place=Stuttgart|publisher=Holzmann-Froboog|isbn=3-7728-0373-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that evolutionary algorithms gained popularity. A good overview text on evolutionary algorithms is the book "An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms" by Mitchell (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Mitchell|first= Melanie|year=1996|title='An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms|place= Cambridge, MA|publisher= MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gene expression programming&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferreira|first=C.|year=2001|title=Gene Expression Programming: A New Adaptive Algorithm for Solving Problems|url= http://www.gene-expression-programming.com/webpapers/GEP.pdf|publisher= Complex Systems, Vol. 13, issue 2: 87–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; belongs to the family of [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and is closely related to [[genetic algorithms]] and [[genetic programming]]. From genetic algorithms it inherited the linear chromosomes of fixed length; and from genetic programming it inherited the expressive [[parse tree]]s of varied sizes and shapes.

In gene expression programming the linear chromosomes work as the genotype and the parse trees as the phenotype, creating a [[Genotype-phenotype distinction|genotype/phenotype system]]. This genotype/phenotype system is [[Gene|multigenic]], thus encoding multiple parse trees in each chromosome. This means that the computer programs created by GEP are composed of multiple parse trees. Because these parse trees are the result of gene expression, in GEP they are called [[expression tree]]s.

==Encoding: the genotype==
The genome of gene expression programming consists of a linear, symbolic string or chromosome of fixed length composed of one or more genes of equal size. These genes, despite their fixed length, code for expression trees of different sizes and shapes. An example of a chromosome with two genes, each of size 9, is the string (position zero indicates the start of each gene):

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;012345678012345678&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;L+a-baccd**cLabacd&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

where “L” represents the natural logarithm function and “a”, “b”, “c”, and “d” represent the variables and constants used in a problem.

==Expression trees: the phenotype==
As shown [[gene expression programming#Encoding: the genotype|above]], the genes of gene expression programming have all the same size. However, these fixed length strings code for [[expression tree]]s of different sizes. This means that the size of the coding regions varies from gene to gene, allowing for adaptation and evolution to occur smoothly.

For example, the mathematical expression:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(a-b)(c+d)} \, &lt;/math&gt;
can also be represented as an expression tree:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:GEP expression tree, k-expression Q*-+abcd.png]]
|}

where "Q” represents the square root function.

This kind of expression tree consists of the phenotypic expression of GEP genes, whereas the genes are linear strings encoding these complex structures. For this particular example, the linear string corresponds to:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;01234567&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Q*-+abcd&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

which is the straightforward reading of the expression tree from top to bottom and from left to right. These linear strings are called k-expressions (from [[Karva notation]]).

Going from k-expressions to expression trees is also very simple. For example, the following k-expression:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;01234567890&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Q*b**+baQba&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

is composed of two different terminals (the variables “a” and “b”), two different functions of two arguments (“*” and “+”), and a function of one argument (“Q”). Its expression gives:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:GEP expression tree, k-expression Q*b**+baQba.png]]
|}

==K-expressions and genes==
The k-expressions of gene expression programming correspond to the region of genes that gets expressed. This means that there might be sequences in the genes that are not expressed, which is indeed true for most genes. The reason for these noncoding regions is to provide a buffer of terminals so that all k-expressions encoded in GEP genes correspond always to valid programs or expressions.

The genes of gene expression programming are therefore composed of two different domains – a head and a tail – each with different properties and functions. The head is used mainly to encode the functions and variables chosen to solve the problem at hand, whereas the tail, while also used to encode the variables, provides essentially a reservoir of terminals to ensure that all programs are error-free.

For GEP genes the length of the tail is given by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;t = h(n_\max-1)+1&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the head’s length and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is maximum arity. For example, for a gene created using the set of functions F = {Q, +, −, *, /} and the set of terminals T = {a, b}, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 2. And if we choose a head length of 15, then ''t'' = 15 (2–1) + 1 = 16, which gives a gene length ''g'' of 15 + 16 = 31. The randomly generated string below is an example of one such gene:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;0123456789012345678901234567890&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*b+a-aQab+//+b+babbabbbababbaaa&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

It encodes the expression tree:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:GEP expression tree, k-expression *b+a-aQa.png]]
|}

which, in this case, only uses 8 of the 31 elements that constitute the gene.

It's not hard to see that, despite their fixed length, each gene has the potential to code for expression trees of different sizes and shapes, with the simplest composed of only one node (when the first element of a gene is a terminal) and the largest composed of as many nodes as there are elements in the gene (when all the elements in the head are functions with maximum arity).

It's also not hard to see that it is trivial to implement all kinds of [[genetic operator|genetic modification]] ([[mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]], inversion, insertion, [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|recombination]], and so on) with the guarantee that all resulting offspring encode correct, error-free programs.

==Multigenic chromosomes==
The chromosomes of gene expression programming are usually composed of more than one gene of equal length. Each gene codes for a sub-expression tree (sub-ET) or sub-program. Then the sub-ETs can interact with one another in different ways, forming a more complex program. The figure shows an example of a program composed of three sub-ETs.

[[File:Expression of 3 GEP genes, 1st k-expression *Qb+*-bbba.png|thumb|Expression of GEP genes as sub-ETs. a) A three-genic chromosome with the tails shown in bold. b) The sub-ETs encoded by each gene.]]

In the final program the sub-ETs could be linked by addition or some other function, as there are no restrictions to the kind of linking function one might choose. Some examples of more complex linkers include taking the average, the median, the midrange, thresholding their sum to make a binomial classification, applying the sigmoid function to compute a probability, and so on. These linking functions are usually chosen a priori for each problem, but they can also be evolved elegantly and efficiently by the [[gene expression programming#Cells and code reuse|cellular system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferreira|first=C.|title=Gene Expression Programming: Mathematical Modeling by an Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.gene-expression-programming.com/GepBook/Introduction.htm|publisher=Angra do Heroismo |location=Portugal|year=2002|isbn=972-95890-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferreira|first=C.|year=2006|title=Automatically Defined Functions in Gene Expression Programming|url= http://www.gene-expression-programming.com/webpapers/Ferreira-GSP2006.pdf|publisher= In N. Nedjah, L. de M. Mourelle, A. Abraham, eds., ''Genetic Systems Programming: Theory and Experiences, Studies in Computational Intelligence'', Vol. 13, pp. 21–56, Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; of gene expression programming.

==Cells and code reuse==
In gene expression programming, [[gene expression programming#Homeotic genes and the cellular system|homeotic genes]] control the interactions of the different sub-ETs or modules of the main program. The expression of such genes results in different main programs or cells, that is, they determine which genes are expressed in each cell and how the sub-ETs of each cell interact with one another. In other words, homeotic genes determine which sub-ETs are called upon and how often in which main program or cell and what kind of connections they establish with one another.

===Homeotic genes and the cellular system===
Homeotic genes have exactly the same kind of structural organization as normal genes and they are built using an identical process. They also contain a head domain and a tail domain, with the difference that the heads contain now linking functions and a special kind of terminals – genic terminals – that represent the normal genes. The expression of the normal genes results as usual in different sub-ETs, which in the cellular system are called ADFs (automatically defined functions). As for the tails, they contain only genic terminals, that is, derived features generated on the fly by the algorithm.

For example, the chromosome in the figure has three normal genes and one homeotic gene and encodes a main program that invokes three different functions a total of four times, linking them in a particular way.

[[File:Expression of a unicellular GEP system with three ADFs.png|thumb|Expression of a unicellular system with three ADFs. a) The chromosome composed of three conventional genes and one homeotic gene (shown in bold). b) The ADFs encoded by each conventional gene. c) The main program or cell.]]

From this example it is clear that the cellular system not only allows the unconstrained evolution of linking functions but also code reuse. And it shouldn't be hard to implement [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]] in this system.

===Multiple main programs and multicellular systems===
Multicellular systems are composed of more than one [[gene expression programming#Homeotic genes and the cellular system|homeotic gene]]. Each homeotic gene in this system puts together a different combination of sub-expression trees or ADFs, creating multiple cells or main programs.

For example, the program shown in the figure was created using a cellular system with two cells and three normal genes.

[[File:Expression of a multicellular GEP system with 3 ADFs and 2 main programs.png|thumb|Expression of a multicellular system with three ADFs and two main programs. a) The chromosome composed of three conventional genes and two homeotic genes (shown in bold). b) The ADFs encoded by each conventional gene. c) Two different main programs expressed in two different cells.]]

The applications of these multicellular systems are multiple and varied and, like the [[gene expression programming#Multigenic chromosomes|multigenic systems]], they can be used both in problems with just one output and in problems with multiple outputs.

==Other levels of complexity==
The head/tail domain of GEP genes (both normal and homeotic) is the basic building block of all GEP algorithms. However, gene expression programming also explores other chromosomal organizations that are more complex than the head/tail structure. Essentially these complex structures consist of functional units or genes with a basic head/tail domain plus one or more extra domains. These extra domains usually encode random numerical constants that the algorithm relentlessly fine-tunes in order to find a good solution. For instance, these numerical constants may be the weights or factors in a function approximation problem (see the [[gene expression programming#The GEP-RNC algorithm|GEP-RNC algorithm]] below); they may be the weights and thresholds of a neural network (see the [[gene expression programming#Neural networks|GEP-NN algorithm]] below); the numerical constants needed for the design of decision trees (see the [[gene expression programming#Decision trees|GEP-DT algorithm]] below); the weights needed for polynomial induction; or the random numerical constants used to discover the parameter values in a parameter optimization task.

==The basic gene expression algorithm==
The fundamental steps of the basic gene expression algorithm are listed below in pseudocode:
:1.	Select function set;
:2.	Select terminal set;
:3.	Load dataset for fitness evaluation;
:4.	Create chromosomes of initial population randomly;
:5.	For each program in population:
::a)	Express chromosome;
::b)	Execute program;
::c)	Evaluate fitness;
:6.	Verify stop condition;
:7.	Select programs;
:8.	Replicate selected programs to form the next population;
:9.	Modify chromosomes using genetic operators;
:10.	Go to step 5.
The first four steps prepare all the ingredients that are needed for the iterative loop of the algorithm (steps 5 through 10). Of these preparative steps, the crucial one is the creation of the initial population, which is created randomly using the elements of the function and terminal sets.

===Populations of programs===
Like all evolutionary algorithms, gene expression programming works with populations of individuals, which in this case are computer programs. Therefore, some kind of initial population must be created to get things started. Subsequent populations are descendants, via [[gene expression programming#Selection and elitism|selection]] and [[gene expression programming#Reproduction with modification|genetic modification]], of the initial population.

In the genotype/phenotype system of gene expression programming, it is only necessary to create the simple linear chromosomes of the individuals without worrying about the structural soundness of the programs they code for, as their expression always results in syntactically correct programs.

===Fitness functions and the selection environment===
Fitness functions and selection environments (called training datasets in [[machine learning]]) are the two facets of fitness and are therefore intricately connected. Indeed, the fitness of a program depends not only on the [[Loss function|cost function]] used to measure its performance but also on the training data chosen to evaluate fitness

====The selection environment or training data====
The selection environment consists of the set of training records, which are also called fitness cases. These fitness cases could be a set of observations or measurements concerning some problem, and they form what is called the training dataset.

The quality of the training data is essential for the evolution of good solutions. A good training set should be representative of the problem at hand and also well-balanced, otherwise the algorithm might get stuck at some local optimum. In addition, it is also important to avoid using unnecessarily large datasets for training as this will slow things down unnecessarily. A good rule of thumb is to choose enough records for training to enable a good generalization in the validation data and leave the remaining records for validation and testing.

====Fitness functions====
Broadly speaking, there are essentially three different kinds of problems based on the kind of prediction being made:
:1.	Problems involving numeric (continuous) predictions;
:2.	Problems involving categorical or nominal predictions, both binomial and multinomial;
:3.	Problems involving binary or Boolean predictions.
The first type of problem goes by the name of [[Regression analysis|regression]]; the second is known as [[Statistical classification|classification]], with [[logistic regression]] as a special case where, besides the crisp classifications like "Yes" or "No", a probability is also attached to each outcome; and the last one is related to [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] and [[logic synthesis]].

=====Fitness functions for regression=====
In [[Regression analysis|regression]], the response or dependent variable is numeric (usually continuous) and therefore the output of a regression model is also continuous. So it's quite straightforward to evaluate the fitness of the evolving models by comparing the output of the model to the value of the response in the training data.

There are several basic [[fitness function]]s for evaluating model performance, with the most common being based on the error or residual between the model output and the actual value. Such functions include the [[mean squared error]], [[root mean squared error]], [[mean absolute error]], relative squared error, root relative squared error, relative absolute error, and others.

All these standard measures offer a fine granularity or smoothness to the solution space and therefore work very well for most applications. But some problems might require a coarser evolution, such as determining if a prediction is within a certain interval, for instance less than 10% of the actual value. However, even if one is only interested in counting the hits (that is, a prediction that is within the chosen interval), making populations of models evolve based on just the number of hits each program scores is usually not very efficient due to the coarse granularity of the [[fitness landscape]]. Thus the solution usually involves combining these coarse measures with some kind of smooth function such as the standard error measures listed above.

Fitness functions based on the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] and [[R-square]] are also very smooth. For regression problems, these functions work best by combining them with other measures because, by themselves, they only tend to measure [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]], not caring for the range of values of the model output. So by combining them with functions that work at approximating the range of the target values, they form very efficient fitness functions for finding models with good correlation and good fit between predicted and actual values.

=====Fitness functions for classification and logistic regression=====
The design of fitness functions for [[Statistical classification|classification]] and [[logistic regression]] takes advantage of three different characteristics of classification models. The most obvious is just counting the hits, that is, if a record is classified correctly it is counted as a hit. This fitness function is very simple and works well for simple problems, but for more complex problems or datasets highly unbalanced it gives poor results.

One way to improve this type of hits-based fitness function consists of expanding the notion of correct and incorrect classifications. In a binary classification task, correct classifications can be 00 or 11. The "00" representation means that a negative case (represented by "0”) was correctly classified, whereas the "11" means that a positive case (represented by "1”) was correctly classified. Classifications of the type "00" are called true negatives (TN) and "11" true positives (TP).

There are also two types of incorrect classifications and they are represented by 01 and 10. They are called false positives (FP) when the actual value is 0 and the model predicts a 1; and false negatives (FN) when the target is 1 and the model predicts a 0. The counts of TP, TN, FP, and FN are usually kept on a table known as the [[confusion matrix]].

[[File:Binary confusion matrix.png|thumb|[[Confusion matrix]] for a binomial classification task.]]

So by counting the TP, TN, FP, and FN and further assigning different weights to these four types of classifications, it is possible to create smoother and therefore more efficient fitness functions. Some popular fitness functions based on the confusion matrix include [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity/specificity]], [[Precision and recall|recall/precision]], [[F-measure]], [[Jaccard similarity]], [[Matthews correlation coefficient]], and cost/gain matrix which combines the costs and gains assigned to the 4 different types of classifications.

These functions based on the confusion matrix are quite sophisticated and are adequate to solve most problems efficiently. But there is another dimension to classification models which is key to exploring more efficiently the solution space and therefore results in the discovery of better classifiers. This new dimension involves exploring the structure of the model itself, which includes not only the domain and range, but also the distribution of the model output and the classifier margin.

By exploring this other dimension of classification models and then combining the information about the model with the confusion matrix, it is possible to design very sophisticated fitness functions that allow the smooth exploration of the solution space. For instance, one can combine some measure based on the confusion matrix with the [[mean squared error]] evaluated between the raw model outputs and the actual values. Or combine the [[F-measure]] with the [[R-square]] evaluated for the raw model output and the target; or the cost/gain matrix with the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]], and so on. More exotic fitness functions that explore model granularity include the area under the [[Receiver operating characteristic|ROC curve]] and rank measure.

Also related to this new dimension of classification models, is the idea of assigning probabilities to the model output, which is what is done in [[logistic regression]]. Then it is also possible to use these probabilities and evaluate the [[mean squared error]] (or some other similar measure) between the probabilities and the actual values, then combine this with the confusion matrix to create very efficient fitness functions for logistic regression. Popular examples of fitness functions based on the probabilities include [[maximum likelihood estimation]] and [[hinge loss]].

=====Fitness functions for Boolean problems=====
In logic there is no model structure (as defined [[gene expression programming#Fitness functions for classification and logistic regression|above]] for classification and logistic regression) to explore: the domain and range of logical functions comprises only 0’s and 1’s or false and true. So, the fitness functions available for [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] can only be based on the hits or on the confusion matrix as explained in the section [[gene expression programming#Fitness functions for classification and logistic regression|above]].

===Selection and elitism===
[[Roulette-wheel selection]] is perhaps the most popular selection scheme used in evolutionary computation. It involves mapping the fitness of each program to a slice of the roulette wheel proportional to its fitness. Then the roulette is spun as many times as there are programs in the population in order to keep the population size constant. So, with roulette-wheel selection programs are selected both according to fitness and the luck of the draw, which means that some times the best traits might be lost. However, by combining roulette-wheel selection with the cloning of the best program of each generation, one guarantees that at least the very best traits are not lost. This technique of cloning the best-of-generation program is known as simple elitism and is used by most stochastic selection schemes.

===Reproduction with modification===
The reproduction of programs involves first the selection and then the reproduction of their genomes. Genome modification is not required for reproduction, but without it adaptation and evolution won't take place.

====Replication and selection====
The selection operator selects the programs for the replication operator to copy. Depending on the selection scheme, the number of copies one program originates may vary, with some programs getting copied more than once while others are copied just once or not at all. In addition, selection is usually set up so that the population size remains constant from one generation to another.

The replication of genomes in nature is very complex and it took scientists a long time to discover the [[DNA double helix]] and propose a mechanism for its replication. But the replication of strings is trivial in artificial evolutionary systems, where only an instruction to copy strings is required to pass all the information in the genome from generation to generation.

The replication of the selected programs is a fundamental piece of all artificial evolutionary systems, but for evolution to occur it needs to be implemented not with the usual precision of a copy instruction, but rather with a few errors thrown in. Indeed, genetic diversity is created with [[genetic operator]]s such as [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]], [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|recombination]], [[Transposition (genetics)|transposition]], inversion, and many others.

====Mutation====
In gene expression programming mutation is the most important genetic operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferreira|first=C.|year=2002|title=Mutation, Transposition, and Recombination: An Analysis of the Evolutionary Dynamics|url= http://www.gene-expression-programming.com/webpapers/ferreira-fea02.pdf|publisher=  In H. J. Caulfield, S.-H. Chen, H.-D. Cheng, R. Duro, V. Honavar, E. E. Kerre, M. Lu, M. G. Romay, T. K. Shih, D. Ventura, P. P. Wang, Y. Yang, eds., Proceedings of the 6th Joint Conference on Information Sciences, 4th International Workshop on Frontiers in Evolutionary Algorithms, pages 614–617, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It changes genomes by changing an element by another. The accumulation of many small changes over time can create great diversity.

In gene expression programming mutation is totally unconstrained, which means that in each gene domain any domain symbol can be replaced by another. For example, in the heads of genes any function can be replaced by a terminal or another function, regardless of the number of arguments in this new function; and a terminal can be replaced by a function or another terminal.

====Recombination====
[[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|Recombination]] usually involves two parent chromosomes to create two new chromosomes by combining different parts from the parent chromosomes. And as long as the parent chromosomes are aligned and the exchanged fragments are homologous (that is, occupy the same position in the chromosome), the new chromosomes created by recombination will always encode syntactically correct programs.

Different kinds of crossover are easily implemented either by changing the number of parents involved (there's no reason for choosing only two); the number of split points; or the way one chooses to exchange the fragments, for example, either randomly or in some orderly fashion. For example, gene recombination, which is a special case of recombination, can be done by exchanging homologous genes (genes that occupy the same position in the chromosome) or by exchanging genes chosen at random from any position in the chromosome.

====Transposition====
[[Transposition (genetics)|Transposition]] involves the introduction of an insertion sequence somewhere in a chromosome. In gene expression programming insertion sequences might appear anywhere in the chromosome, but they are only inserted in the heads of genes. This method guarantees that even insertion sequences from the tails result in error-free programs.

For transposition to work properly, it must preserve chromosome length and gene structure. So, in gene expression programming transposition can be implemented using two different methods: the first creates a shift at the insertion site, followed by a deletion at the end of the head; the second overwrites the local sequence at the target site and therefore is easier to implement. Both methods can be implemented to operate between chromosomes or within a chromosome or even within a single gene.

====Inversion====
Inversion is an interesting operator, especially powerful for combinatorial optimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferreira|first=C.|year=2002|title=Combinatorial Optimization by Gene Expression Programming: Inversion Revisited|url= http://www.gene-expression-programming.com/webpapers/Ferreira-ASAI02.pdf|publisher= In J. M. Santos and A. Zapico, eds., Proceedings of the Argentine Symposium on Artificial Intelligence, pages 160–174, Santa Fe, Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of inverting a small sequence within a chromosome.

In gene expression programming it can be easily implemented in all gene domains and, in all cases, the offspring produced is always syntactically correct. For any gene domain, a sequence (ranging from at least two elements to as big as the domain itself) is chosen at random within that domain and then inverted.

====Other genetic operators====
Several other genetic operators exist and in gene expression programming, with its different genes and gene domains, the possibilities are endless. For example, genetic operators such as one-point recombination, two-point recombination, gene recombination, uniform recombination, gene transposition, root transposition, domain-specific mutation, domain-specific inversion, domain-specific transposition, and so on, are easily implemented and widely used.

==The GEP-RNC algorithm==
Numerical constants are essential elements of mathematical and statistical models and therefore it is important to allow their integration in the models designed by evolutionary algorithms.

Gene expression programming solves this problem very elegantly through the use of an extra gene domain – the Dc – for handling random numerical constants (RNC). By combining this domain with a special terminal placeholder for the RNCs, a richly expressive system can be created.

Structurally, the Dc comes after the tail, has a length equal to the size of the tail ''t'', and is composed of the symbols used to represent the RNCs.

For example, below is shown a simple chromosome composed of only one gene a head size of 7 (the Dc stretches over positions 15–22):

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;01234567890123456789012&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;+?*+?**aaa??aaa68083295&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

where the terminal "?” represents the placeholder for the RNCs. This kind of chromosome is expressed exactly as shown [[gene expression programming#Expression trees: the phenotype|above]], giving:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:GEP expression tree with placeholder for RNCs.png]]
|}

Then the ?'s in the expression tree are replaced from left to right and from top to bottom by the symbols (for simplicity represented by numerals) in the Dc, giving:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:GEP expression tree with symbols (numerals) for RNCs.png]]
|}

The values corresponding to these symbols are kept in an array. (For simplicity, the number represented by the numeral indicates the order in the array.) For instance, for the following 10 element array of RNCs:

:C = {0.611, 1.184, 2.449, 2.98, 0.496, 2.286, 0.93, 2.305, 2.737, 0.755}

the expression tree above gives:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:GEP expression tree with RNCs.png]]
|}

This elegant structure for handling random numerical constants is at the heart of different GEP systems, such as [[gene expression programming#Neural networks|GEP neural networks]] and [[gene expression programming#Decision trees|GEP decision trees]].

Like the [[gene expression programming#The basic gene expression algorithm|basic gene expression algorithm]], the GEP-RNC algorithm is also multigenic and its chromosomes are decoded as usual by expressing one gene after another and then linking them all together by the same kind of linking process.

The genetic operators used in the GEP-RNC system are an extension to the genetic operators of the basic GEP algorithm (see [[gene expression programming#Reproduction with modification|above]]), and they all can be straightforwardly implemented in these new chromosomes. On the other hand, the basic operators of mutation, inversion, transposition, and recombination are also used in the GEP-RNC algorithm. Furthermore, special Dc-specific operators such as mutation, inversion, and transposition, are also used to aid in a more efficient circulation of the RNCs among individual programs. In addition, there is also a special mutation operator that allows the permanent introduction of variation in the set of RNCs. The initial set of RNCs is randomly created at the beginning of a run, which means that, for each gene in the initial population, a specified number of numerical constants, chosen from a certain range, are randomly generated. Then their circulation and mutation is enabled by the genetic operators.

==Neural networks==
An [[artificial neural network]] (ANN or NN) is a computational device that consists of many simple connected units or neurons. The connections between the units are usually weighted by real-valued weights. These weights are the primary means of learning in neural networks and a learning algorithm is usually used to adjust them.

Structurally, a neural network has three different classes of units: input units, hidden units, and output units. An activation pattern is presented at the input units and then spreads in a forward direction from the input units through one or more layers of hidden units to the output units. The activation coming into one unit from other unit is multiplied by the weights on the links over which it spreads. All incoming activation is then added together and the unit becomes activated only if the incoming result is above the unit’s threshold.

In summary, the basic components of a neural network are the units, the connections between the units, the weights, and the thresholds. So, in order to fully simulate an artificial neural network one must somehow encode these components in a linear chromosome and then be able to express them in a meaningful way.

In GEP neural networks (GEP-NN or GEP nets), the network architecture is encoded in the usual structure of a head/tail domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferreira|first=C.|year=2006|title=Designing Neural Networks Using Gene Expression Programming|url= http://www.gene-expression-programming.com/webpapers/Ferreira-ASCT2006.pdf|publisher= In A. Abraham, B. de Baets, M. Köppen, and B. Nickolay, eds., Applied Soft Computing Technologies: The Challenge of Complexity, pages 517–536, Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head contains special functions/neurons that activate the hidden and output units (in the GEP context, all these units are more appropriately called functional units) and terminals that represent the input units. The tail, as usual, contains only terminals/input units.

Besides the head and the tail, these neural network genes contain two additional domains, Dw and Dt, for encoding the weights and thresholds of the neural network. Structurally, the Dw comes after the tail and its length ''d&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' depends on the head size ''h'' and maximum arity ''n''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and is evaluated by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;d_{w} = hn_\max&lt;/math&gt;

The Dt comes after Dw and has a length ''d&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' equal to ''t''. Both domains are composed of symbols representing the weights and thresholds of the neural network.

For each NN-gene, the weights and thresholds are created at the beginning of each run, but their circulation and adaptation are guaranteed by the usual genetic operators of [[gene expression programming#Mutation|mutation]], [[gene expression programming#Transposition|transposition]], [[gene expression programming#Inversion|inversion]], and [[gene expression programming#Recombination|recombination]]. In addition, special operators are also used to allow a constant flow of genetic variation in the set of weights and thresholds.

For example, below is shown a neural network with two input units (''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), two hidden units (''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and one output unit (''o''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). It has a total of six connections with six corresponding weights represented by the numerals 1–6 (for simplicity, the thresholds are all equal to 1 and are omitted):

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:Neural network with 5 units.png]]
|}

This representation is the canonical neural network representation, but neural networks can also be represented by a tree, which, in this case, corresponds to:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:GEP neural network with 7 nodes.png]]
|}

where "a” and "b” represent the two inputs ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and "D” represents a function with connectivity two. This function adds all its weighted arguments and then thresholds this activation in order to determine the forwarded output. This output (zero or one in this simple case) depends on the threshold of each unit, that is, if the total incoming activation is equal to or greater than the threshold, then the output is one, zero otherwise.

The above NN-tree can be linearized as follows:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;0123456789012&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;DDDabab654321&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

where the structure in positions 7–12 (Dw) encodes the weights. The values of each weight are kept in an array and retrieved as necessary for expression.

As a more concrete example, below is shown a neural net gene for the [[exclusive or|exclusive-or]] problem. It has a head size of 3 and Dw size of 6:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;0123456789012&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;DDDabab393257&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Its expression results in the following neural network:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:Expression of a GEP neural network for the exclusive-or.png]]
|}

which, for the set of weights:

: ''W'' = {−1.978, 0.514, −0.465, 1.22, −1.686, −1.797, 0.197, 1.606, 0, 1.753}

it gives:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:GEP neural network solution for the exclusive-or.png]]
|}

which is a perfect solution to the exclusive-or function.

Besides simple Boolean functions with binary inputs and binary outputs, the GEP-nets algorithm can handle all kinds of functions or neurons (linear neuron, tanh neuron, atan neuron, logistic neuron, limit neuron, radial basis and triangular basis neurons, all kinds of step neurons, and so on). Also interesting is that the GEP-nets algorithm can use all these neurons together and let evolution decide which ones work best to solve the problem at hand. So, GEP-nets can be used not only in Boolean problems but also in [[logistic regression]], [[Statistical classification|classification]], and [[Regression analysis|regression]]. In all cases, GEP-nets can be implemented not only with [[gene expression programming#Multigenic chromosomes|multigenic systems]] but also [[gene expression programming#Cells and code reuse|cellular systems]], both unicellular and multicellular. Furthermore, multinomial classification problems can also be tackled in one go by GEP-nets both with multigenic systems and multicellular systems.

==Decision trees==
[[Decision trees]] (DT) are classification models where a series of questions and answers are mapped using nodes and directed edges.

Decision trees have three types of nodes: a root node, internal nodes, and leaf or terminal nodes. The root node and all internal nodes represent test conditions for different attributes or variables in a dataset. Leaf nodes specify the class label for all different paths in the tree.

Most decision tree induction algorithms involve selecting an attribute for the root node and then make the same kind of informed decision about all the nodes in a tree.

Decision trees can also be created by gene expression programming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=C. |title=Gene Expression Programming: Mathematical Modeling by an Artificial Intelligence |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2006 |isbn=3-540-32796-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the advantage that all the decisions concerning the growth of the tree are made by the algorithm itself without any kind of human input.

There are basically two different types of DT algorithms: one for inducing decision trees with only nominal attributes and another for inducing decision trees with both numeric and nominal attributes. This aspect of decision tree induction also carries to gene expression programming and there are two GEP algorithms for decision tree induction: the evolvable decision trees (EDT) algorithm for dealing exclusively with nominal attributes and the EDT-RNC (EDT with random numerical constants) for handling both nominal and numeric attributes.

In the decision trees induced by gene expression programming, the attributes behave as function nodes in the [[gene expression programming#The basic gene expression algorithm|basic gene expression algorithm]], whereas the class labels behave as terminals. This means that attribute nodes have also associated with them a specific arity or number of branches that will determine their growth and, ultimately, the growth of the tree. Class labels behave like terminals, which means that for a ''k''-class classification task, a terminal set with ''k'' terminals is used, representing the ''k'' different classes.

The rules for encoding a decision tree in a linear genome are very similar to the rules used to encode mathematical expressions (see [[gene expression programming#K-expressions and genes|above]]). So, for decision tree induction the genes also have a head and a tail, with the head containing attributes and terminals and the tail containing only terminals. This again ensures that all decision trees designed by GEP are always valid programs. Furthermore, the size of the tail ''t'' is also dictated by the head size ''h'' and the number of branches of the attribute with more branches ''n''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and is evaluated by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;t = h(n_\max-1)+1 \, &lt;/math&gt;

For example, consider the decision tree below to decide whether to play outside:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:Decision tree for playing outside.png]]
|}

It can be linearly encoded as:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;01234567&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;HOWbaaba&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

where “H” represents the attribute Humidity, “O” the attribute Outlook, “W” represents Windy, and “a” and “b” the class labels "Yes" and "No" respectively. Note that the edges connecting the nodes are properties of the data, specifying the type and number of branches of each attribute, and therefore don’t have to be encoded.

The process of decision tree induction with gene expression programming starts, as usual, with an initial population of randomly created chromosomes. Then the chromosomes are expressed as decision trees and their fitness evaluated against a training dataset. According to fitness they are then selected to reproduce with modification. The genetic operators are exactly the same that are used in a conventional unigenic system, for example, [[gene expression programming#Mutation|mutation]], [[gene expression programming#Inversion|inversion]], [[gene expression programming#Transposition|transposition]], and [[gene expression programming#Recombination|recombination]].

Decision trees with both nominal and numeric attributes are also easily induced with gene expression programming using the framework described [[gene expression programming#The GEP-RNC algorithm|above]] for dealing with random numerical constants. The chromosomal architecture includes an extra domain for encoding random numerical constants, which are used as thresholds for splitting the data at each branching node. For example, the gene below with a head size of 5 (the Dc starts at position 16):

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;012345678901234567890&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;WOTHabababbbabba46336&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

encodes the decision tree shown below:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:GEP decision tree, k-expression WOTHababab.png]]
|}

In this system, every node in the head, irrespective of its type (numeric attribute, nominal attribute, or terminal), has associated with it a random numerical constant, which for simplicity in the example above is represented by a numeral 0–9. These random numerical constants are encoded in the Dc domain and their expression follows a very simple scheme: from top to bottom and from left to right, the elements in Dc are assigned one-by-one to the elements in the decision tree. So, for the following array of RNCs:

: ''C'' = {62, 51, 68, 83, 86, 41, 43, 44, 9, 67}

the decision tree above results in:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:GEP decision tree with numeric and nominal attributes, k-expression WOTHababab.png]]
|}

which can also be represented more colorfully as a conventional decision tree:

| [[File:GEP decision tree with numeric and nominal attributes.png]]
|}

==Criticism==
GEP has been criticized for not being a major improvement over other [[genetic programming]] techniques. In many experiments, it did not perform better than existing methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=A comparison of several linear genetic programming techniques |

He was widely known for his work in the 1980s and 1990s, including hit Wham! singles such as "[[Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go]]" and "[[Last Christmas]]" and solo albums such as ''[[Faith (George Michael album)|Faith]]'' (1987) and ''[[Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1]]'' (1990).

Michael achieved seven [[Lists of UK Singles Chart number ones|number one singles in the UK]] and eight [[List of Billboard number-one singles|number one songs on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the US]], including "[[Careless Whisper]]" and "[[Praying for Time]]". He ranks among the [[List of biggest selling British acts of all time|best-selling British acts of all time]], and in 2008, Michael was ranked 40th on ''Billboard''{{'}}s list of the Greatest Hot 100 Artists of All Time.

==Solo career==

===1987–1989===
The beginning of his solo career, during early 1987, was a duet with [[Aretha Franklin]]. "[[I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)]]" was a one-off project that helped Michael achieve an ambition by singing with one of his favourite artists. It scored number one on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] upon its release.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bego ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ErKigdCXUwoC&amp;pg=PA249 Aretha Franklin: the queen of soul]'' Da Capo Press, 2001 (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Ellis, Bryony Sutherland (1998) ''The complete guide to the music of George Michael &amp; Wham!'' p. 37. Music Sales Group, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For Michael, it became his third consecutive solo number one in the UK from three releases, after 1984's "Careless Whisper" (though the single was actually from the Wham! album ''[[Make It Big]]'') and 1986's "[[A Different Corner]]". The single was also the first Michael had recorded as a solo artist which he had not written himself. The co-writer, [[Simon Climie]], was unknown at the time; he later had success as a performer with the band [[Climie Fisher]] in 1988. Michael and Aretha Franklin won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1988 for Best R&amp;B Performance – Duo or Group with Vocal for the song.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111003160318/http://rockhall.com/story-of-rock/timelines/aretha-franklin/basic/ Aretha Franklin Timeline] The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, 2010.

His first single "[[Freeek!]]", taken from the new album, was successful in Europe going to No. 1 in Italy, Portugal, Spain and Denmark in 2002 and reaching the top 10 in the UK and the top 5 in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://top40-charts.com/song.php?sid=3580&amp;sort=chartid George Michael Freeek!] Top40-charts.com.

It was acutely critical of US President [[George W. Bush]] and UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in the lead-up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7444297.stm George Michael's highs and lows] BBC News, 21 September 2008.

In February 2003, Michael unexpectedly recorded another song in protest against the looming Iraq war, [[Don McLean]]'s "The Grave". The original was written by McLean in 1971 and was a protest against the [[Vietnam War]]. Michael performed the song on numerous TV shows including ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[So Graham Norton]]''. His performance of the song on ''Top of the Pops'' on 7 March 2003 was his first studio appearance on the programme since 1986.

I am delighted that he chose a song of mine to express these feelings. We must remember that the Wizard is really a cowardly old man hiding behind a curtain with a loud microphone. It takes courage and a song to pull the curtain open and expose him.

==Personal life==
===Sexuality and relationships===
Michael stated that his early fantasies were about women, which "led me to believe I was on the path to [[heterosexuality]]", but at puberty he started to fantasise about men, which he later said "had something to do with my environment". At the age of 19, Michael told Andrew Ridgeley that he was [[bisexual]].&lt;ref name="gq-magazine.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore |first=Jane |url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/men-of-the-year/home/hall-of-fame/george-michael-interview |title=George Michael on beating drugs, depression and his outing in LA – October 2004 |publisher=GQ magazine |date=October 2004 |accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael also told one of his two sisters, but he was advised not to tell his parents about his sexuality.&lt;ref name="Andrew Johnson"/&gt; In a 1999 interview with ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', Michael told the Editor in Chief, Judy Wieder, that it was "falling in love with a man that ended his conflict over bisexuality".
"I never had a moral problem with being [[Homosexuality|gay]]", Michael told her. "I thought I had fallen in love with a woman a couple of times. Then I fell in love with a man, and realised that none of those things had been love."&lt;ref name="Wieder"&gt;{{cite book|title=Celebrity: The Advocate Interviews |last=Wieder|first=Judy|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wciFOQAACAAJ |editor-last=Wieder|editor-first=Judy|year=2001|publisher=Advocate Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55583-722-8|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Michael said, "I used to sleep with women quite a lot in the Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a relationship because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want to sleep with a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." In the same interview, he added: "If I wasn't with Kenny [his boyfriend at the time], I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant."&lt;ref name="gq-magazine.co.uk"/&gt; In 2007, Michael said he had hidden the fact he was gay because of worries over what effect it might have on his mother.&lt;ref name="Andrew Johnson"&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Johnson|title=George Michael: Why I had to keep my homosexuality secret|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/george-michael-why-i-had-to-keep-my-homosexuality-secret-403989.html|work=The Independent|location=London|date=30 September 2007|accessdate=15 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he added: "My depression at the end of Wham! was because I was beginning to realise I was gay, not bisexual."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johann-hari/george-michael-an-exclusi_b_157401.html|title=Johann Hari: George Michael: An Exclusive Interview|work=The Huffington Post|date=13 January 2009|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1980s, Michael had a relationship with Chinese-American make-up artist Kathy Jeung, who was regarded for a time as his artistic "muse" and who appeared in the "[[I Want Your Sex]]" video.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-38432981 George Michael: Six songs that defined his life], BBC, 26 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Michael later said that she had been his "only bona fide" girlfriend, and that she knew of his bisexuality.&lt;ref name="gq-magazine.co.uk"/&gt; In 2016, Jeung reacted to Michael's death by calling him a "true friend" with whom she had spent "some of the best time of [her] life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7633328/george-michael-dead-music-video-women-memories-photos George Michael's Leading Ladies Share Memories, Photos of '90s Video Heyday], ''Billboard.com'', 26 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 he established a relationship with Anselmo Feleppa, a Brazilian dress designer, whom he had met at the 1991 concert [[Rock in Rio]]. Six months into their relationship, Feleppa discovered that he was [[HIV/AIDS|HIV-positive]]. Michael later said: "It was terrifying news. I thought I could have the disease too.

===Legal troubles===
On 7 April 1998, Michael was arrested for "[[Cottaging|engaging in a lewd act]]" in a public restroom of the [[Will Rogers Memorial Park]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Sue McAllister, [http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/09/local/me-37715 Pop Singer George Michael Arrested in Restroom of Beverly Hills Park], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 9 April 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. Glionna, [http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/29/local/me-54502 Beverly Hills Steps Up Patrols to Stop Cruising], ''Los Angeles Times'', 29 May 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Michael was arrested by undercover policeman Marcelo Rodríguez in a [[sting operation]] using so-called "pretty police".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/76011.stm|title=George Michael goes to ground|publisher=BBC News|access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an MTV interview, Michael stated: "I got followed into the restroom and then this cop—I didn't know it was a cop, obviously—he started playing this game, which I think is called, 'I'll show you mine, you show me yours, and then when you show me yours, I'm going to nick [arrest] you!'"&lt;ref&gt;Rex Wockner [http://gaytoday.badpuppy.com/garchive/people/110998pe.htm George Michael's Tearoom Tale] Gay Today, 9 November 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

After pleading "[[Nolo contendere|no contest]]" to the charge, Michael was fined US$810 and sentenced to 80 hours of [[community service]]. Soon afterwards, Michael made a video for his single "[[Outside (George Michael song)|Outside]]", which satirised the public toilet incident and featured men dressed as policemen kissing. Rodríguez claimed that this video "mocked" him, and that Michael had slandered him in interviews. In 1999, he brought a US$10&amp;nbsp;million court case in California against the singer. The court dismissed the case, but an [[appellate court]] reinstated it on 3 December 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.

In 2006, Michael performed a free concert for [[National Health Service|NHS]] nurses in London to thank the nurses who had cared for his late mother.

Following his death, many charities revealed that Michael had privately been a supporter of them for many years.

Fawaz described, in an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', finding the performer on Christmas morning, "I went round there to wake him up and he was just gone, lying peacefully in bed.

On 29 December 2016, a post-mortem was undertaken to determine the cause of death but was inconclusive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17615">'''George Tirebiter''' was the nickname initially given to a dog at the [[University of Southern California]] in the 1940s who was the unofficial mascot of the school before becoming the official mascot on October 22, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Sid|title=Throngs Clamor at T.B. Feteprint|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/fullbrowser/collection/p15799coll104/id/63939/rv/compoundobject/cpd/63943/rec/34|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=October 23, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nickname was passed on to George Tirebiter's subsequent successors after the original Tirebiter's death in 1950.  The original Tirebiter was a nationally known figure and beloved canine of the University of Southern California.  He would lead the marching band out at home football games and once even entered in an armored car.  Tirebiter was kidnapped, or thought to have been kidnapped, multiple times by the University of Southern California's rival the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], USC student politicians for publicity, and once possibly by a newspaper.  The line of Tirebiters lasted through 1961 when the legacy of the Tirebiter mascots was replaced with [[Traveler (mascot)|Traveler]], the white [[Andalusian horse]] ridden by a Trojan rider at USC home football games and various other university events.

==Origins==
There exists a wide range of possible stories for Tirebiter's origin.

One claims that a stray dog was discovered by a group of USC students at Currie's Ice Cream parlor and that one student remarked that the dog looked like a Navy V-12 student named George Kuhns. Thus, the dog was dubbed "George".

Another story was that the dog was the pet of a local couple and that he was initially named "Leo".  When the couple split the dog was abandoned before being adopted by a local woman, Ann Schreiber.  She was supposedly a great lover of dogs who wanted to provide for the lost dog.  She named him "George" due to the resemblance he bore to a friend of hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Broms|first=Ralph|title=The Tirebiter Story|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/fullbrowser/collection/p15799coll104/id/69038/rv/compoundobject/cpd/69040/rec/41|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=November 21, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another origin story was claimed by Dan Schiavone, president of the [[Trojan Knights]], on the occasion of a memorial ceremony honoring Tirebiter on September 21, 1950.  Schiavone claimed that Tirebiter was a K-9 police dog that was discarded from the program and subsequently found as a stray on USC's campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blake|first=Jim|title=Troy Grieves Over Loss of Beloved Mutt|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/69346/rec/21|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=September 22, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the veracity of this account is somewhat in question due to the context of the speech and this being the singular mention of such an origin.

He received the surname "Tirebiter" because he would bite at the tires of cars he chased down Trousdale Parkway, which bisects the campus. (Today Trousdale is only open to foot traffic.)

==George Tirebiter I==

The first George Tirebiter was for a period of around six years the unofficial mascot of USC.  He was notable for chasing down passing cars and nipping at their wheels.  The lovable shaggy mutt quickly endeared himself to the student body.  He was pampered by the fraternities and sororities in USC's Greek community, routinely being carried back and forth from campus and being fed ice cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=SCoop|first=The|title=Tirebiter's True Identity Revealed|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/fullbrowser/collection/p15799coll104/id/63840/rv/compoundobject/cpd/63843/rec/8|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=May 14, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the student body urged the student government to designate George Tirebiter as the official mascot of USC.  In an elaborate celebration involving a parade of 30 cars, a marching band, and campus celebrities, George Tirebiter was crowned the official mascot of the University of Southern California on October 22, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Sid|title=Throngs Clamor at T.B. Feteprint|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/fullbrowser/collection/p15799coll104/id/63939/rv/compoundobject/cpd/63943/rec/34|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=October 23, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his coronation as official mascot, George Tirebiter was kidnapped by UCLA students on October 30, 1947.  He was taken from USC's campus and sedated.  Then the UCLA students shaved the letters U-C-L-A into the fur on Tirebiter's back.  To take the prank one step further they took Tirebiter by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' to be photographed for the paper.  After this ordeal, Tirebiter was finally returned to USC in a "doped and confused" state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=George Doped: Again Victim of Foul Play|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/64198/rec/9|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=November 3, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once he became the official mascot, the Trojan Knights became his handler at campus events and football games.  At football games, Tirebiter would be led out onto the field with the marching band and for the length of the game stand in front of the student rooting section.

George became further endeared to the student body when he bit the University of California Los Angeles mascot [[Joe Bruin]] on the nose at a home football game and chased after Oski, the Golden Bear mascot of the University of California Berkeley, at another home game.

In 1948, Tirebiter got into trouble with city health officials because of two incidents of biting people and his semi-stray status.  The city presented an ultimatum to USC.  They required that someone or some organization assume responsibility and ownership for the dog or he would be turned into the pound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Padgett|first=Bob|title=Tirebiter Losing Local Battle|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/65835/rec/36|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=September 22, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of these events on September 29, 1948, the Trojan Knights decided that they would take responsibility for Tirebiter's housing, food, ownership, legal liability, and transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=bulletin|first=news|title=Tirebiter Undeclared|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/66039/rec/37|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=September 29, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After assuming responsibility for the dog, the Trojan Knights built a doghouse on [[Bovard Field]] for him.  Due to Tirebiter's loud barking and his proximity to classrooms, numerous professors complained about the noise and disruption he caused.  One professor actually proposed that one student should always be on "Tirebiter duty" to pet the dog and make sure he did not disrupt class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Broms|first=Ralph|title=The Tirebiter Story: Dissatisfied|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/69443/rec/7|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=December 1, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Tirebiter's time as USC's unofficial and official mascot, many people attempted to describe what kind of dog Tirebiter could possibly be.  The most common characterization was that he was merely a pound mutt.  Other attempts, even by canine experts, had similarly underwhelming conclusions.  A zoology professor described him as "sort of an [[Airedale Terrier]]," but conceded that "it would take another 100 years of breeding to produce another George."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Broms|first=Ralph|title=The Tirebiter Story|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/68759/rec/40|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=November 17, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Tirebiter's already surly nature began to get worse.  The Trojan Knights decided to place him in the care of a local animal shelter with the hopes that he would recover.  However, his condition did not improve.  In early 1950, he no longer even recognized or acknowledged his caretakers.  Eddy and George Prussell, former presidents of the Trojan Knights, conferred with Dean of Students Bernard L. Hyink to decide on a solution.  They decided to send him to the farm of Bill Hubbard, a Trojan alumnus, in [[El Centro, California]], for the summer so that the dog could recover.  Sadly, sometime during June 1950, Tirebiter was run over by a passing car on the farm and killed.  For the next three months, however, this news was not disseminated to the public.  It was not until September 19, 1950, that Tirebiter's fate was known.  A ''[[Daily Trojan]]'' writer routinely asked Dan Schiavone, the president of the Trojan Knights, "How's Tirebiter getting along?"  Schiavone responded matter-of-factly, "He's dead."  This news was then broken on September 20, 1950, by the ''Daily Trojan'' with the full page headline "Tirebiter is Dead!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adamsak|first=Phil|title=George Gained Fame on University Avenue|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/68794/rec/29|accessdate=18 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=September 20, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The student body then planned a memorial ceremony for Tirebiter on September 22, 1950.  The ceremony was led by Schiavone and consisted of a parade of convertibles with black bunting, a marching band, and the student body.  Upon reaching Tirebiter's cement footprints, immortalized during Tirebiter's coronation in 1947, a memorial wreath was laid and a trumpeter played "Taps" as the campus said farewell to its beloved canine mascot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Noon Rites Mark Troy Mascot's Death|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/69346/rec/21|accessdate=18 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=September 22, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successors==

===Search for a successor===
The day before the memorial ceremony for Tirebiter I, plans were already being made to find a successor of some sort for the mascot.  A ballot was printed in the ''Daily Trojan'' with choices of "George Jr. , Other Animal, Statue of George, or Other Object.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Make Your Selection for Tirebiter's Heir|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/68699/rec/6|accessdate=18 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=September 21, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nominations of all sorts began to pour in from the student body.  Through one day of voting, [[Delta Tau Delta]]'s pedigreed [[boxer (dog)|boxer]] "Sully" led the voting.  Behind him were the Trojan Knights's proposed successor "George Jr.", who they claimed was Tirebiter I's son, and the [[Acacia (fraternity)|Acacia fraternity]]'s [[bulldog]] "Pythagoras."  In addition to these early leaders, a variety of other canines and memorials were proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delt's Dog 'Sully' Leads Mascot Poll|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/69346/rec/21|accessdate=18 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=September 22, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 1950, Acacia decided to withdraw Pythagoras from the campaign.  Don Gibbs, the fraternity president, explained, "We do not feel that a fraternity-owned dog would make a good mascot because of the competition between fraternities.  A true mascot must have the complete backing of the entire student body in promoting school athletic spirit.  Therefore, we are withdrawing 'Pythagoras'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pythagoras Bows Out as Horse Enters Race|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/68627/rec/39|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=September 25, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally on September 25, it was announced that "Hector the Horse", a spotted [[Palomino]] horse had been entered into the race by the Trovets, a spirit and service organization.  Floyd McCann, president of the Trovets, claimed, "We feel that Hector the Trojan Horse is a much more dignified and appropriate symbol of SC tradition than some dog.  George was a character in his own right and voluntarily adopted the Trojans.  But we don't believe he can be replaced by draft methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pythagoras Bows Out as Horse Enters Race|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/68627/rec/39|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=September 25, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This quote, now seems quite prescient in light of USC's adopting its iconic mascot [[Traveler (mascot)]] in 1961.

On September 26, it became a showdown between "George Tirebiter II" and "Hector the Trojan Horse" after the withdrawal of Sully, the Delta Tau Delta boxer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Horse, Mutt Battle to Fill Tirebiter Job|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/68607/rec/38|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=September 26, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Hector was leading by a slim margin of 36 votes, possible financial problems with Hector were reported by the ''Daily Trojan''.  They calculated that it would be considerably more expensive to have an equine mascot than a canine mascot.  This was due to Hector not being owned by USC, but rather being rented from a nearby stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Troy Solons Meet Tonight; Will Name George's Heir|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/69234/rec/42|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=September 27, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, it was announced that George Tirebiter II would be the official successor to Tirebiter I.  The final vote in the student body senate was guided by Tirebiter II's victory in the ''Daily Trojan'' student poll 800 votes to Hector's 518.  It is a remarkable increase in voting in one day that finally decided the winner.  Tirebiter II's candidacy was most likely aided by the financial questions relating to Hector's ownership and upkeep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tirebiter II Named Official Mascot|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll104/id/68784/rec/28|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=The Daily Trojan|date=September 28, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tirebiter II===

George Tirebiter II was named the official mascot on September 28, 1950.  He made his official debut at a football spirit rally for the USC-Iowa game on September 29.

==Statue==
In 2006, USC unveiled a statue celebrating the mascot's memory.  The life-size statue portrays George Tirebiter II (although he is often mistaken for George Tirebiter I) with a small piece of chewed tire and is located at the south end of campus on Trousdale Parkway between the Mudd Hall of Philosophy and the Leventhal School of Accounting. George is facing Exposition Park and the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]: the home stadium for USC Trojans football.  During "Troy Week", the week before the annual rivalry football game against UCLA, the Trojan Knights, with the help of USC facilities management, erect a cardinal and gold doghouse around the statue to protect it from possible vandalism.

The plaque on the statue reads:&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Michael.  "George Tirebiter." http://www.publicartinla.com/USCArt/tirebiter.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|George Tirebiter was a shaggy mutt who - for a few glorious years in the '40s and '50s - became a beloved Trojan mascot. No one is quite sure when George wandered onto campus, but his feisty personality made him a student favorite as he chased cars and bit tires along University Avenue, not far from where you stand. He was taken to football games in a limousine where he led the Trojan marching band onto the field, often wearing sweaters and odd little hats. He once drew the cheers of thousands when he bit the mask of UCLA mascot, Joe Bruin, on the nose. Rumor has it there is a transcript on file showing George with a GPA of 3.2 in such courses as Chasing Cats 101 and Biting Tires 270. Of all the great USC mascots, none had the bite of George Tirebiter.}}

==Cultural references==
The protagonist of the [[Firesign Theatre]] album ''[[Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers]]'' was named George Leroy Tirebiter, after the dog, and that album's movie-within-a-play, ''High School Madness'' featured a boy named Porgy Tirebiter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2273">The '''Golovans''' (Russian: голованы, lit. "Headies") are a fictional alien race from the [[Noon Universe]] created by the [[Boris and Arkady Strugatsky|Strugatsky brothers]]. Their homeworld is called [[Saraksh]], allegedly discovered by [[Minor personalities of the Noon Universe#Bader.2C_August-Iogann-Maria|A.-I. Bader]] in 2148 AD. The first contact between Golovans and a human was registered in 2157 (initiated by [[Maxim Kammerer]]) although officially it happened three years later in 2160 (see [[Lev Abalkin]]).

Golovans are mentioned in ''"[[Prisoners of Power|Inhabited Island]]"'', ''"[[Beetle in an Anthill]]"'' and ''"[[The Time Wanderers]]"''.

==Description==
Golovans are described as a dog-like race with disproportionately large heads. Their name is a reference to this latter quality.

Although the Golovans' intellectual abilities easily surpass those of [[humans (Noon Universe)|humans]], they lack even basic technology of their own and prefer to use alien tools (although they can easily live without them).

Golovans are considered a lucky mutation of [[Saraksh]] fauna due to extreme radiation levels after the atomic war on Saraksh, although some sources believe that they were genetically bred by the planet's human residents before the war. They resided within Saraksh's irradiated, heavily fortified "forest."

==Golovans and humans==
Because of the mystery Golovans like to surround themselves with, the first official contact between them and humans was registered twelve years after the discovery of their homeworld. A young scientist and [[progressor]] [[Lev Abalkin]] was the first to meet and study them, and he was also the only human to work in a pair with a Golovan, [[Minor personalities of the Noon Universe#Schokn-Itrch|Schokn-Itrch]]. The latter later became the head of the Golovans' permanent embassy on Earth.

After the official contact a number of personal exchange programs were set up (Abalkin was a participant in one of those). Towards the end of the 22nd century, the Golovans decided that they had learned all they possibly could from space exploration and downscaled their involvement in human space programs.

==Plot==
The film opens with Harry Cox ([[Balthazar Getty]]) having sex in a car with his mistress, Lisa ([[Lydia Hearst]]). After Lisa exits the car, his wife Alex ([[Chloë Sevigny]]) calls him and chastises him on the phone. After he hangs up, his throat is slashed, and Lisa is also murdered .

Twelve-year-old Sam is invited to a sleepover at classmate Sofia Cox's mansion in [[Connecticut]]. Sam finds herself embarrassed by her lack of wealth amongst her rich and privileged classmates. Also at the sleepover are Francesca, Ava, and Georgie. Another girl, Cat White, is being driven to the house by her father, Dr. White ([[Timothy Hutton]]); it is established that Cat is suffering psychological problems and has been in trouble for bullying the girls.

The girls engage in a pretend fashion show, incessantly posting photos of themselves on [[social media]] with their [[smart phone]]s. Cat arrives, and Alex allows the girls into her walk-in safe where numerous pieces of jewelry and clothing are stored. She then leaves to go into town for a [[Twelve-step program|twelve-step meeting]].

As the night goes on, the girls, each consumed by their cell phones, begin to fight with one another. Cat instigates a confrontation and taunts Georgie about her weight, and Sofia forces her to leave. Cat storms into the woods, where she attempts to call her father to pick her up. She begins [[Facebook features#Wall|tagging]] Georgie in a stream of cruel photos on [[Facebook]]; the girls collectively decide to lock their cell phones in the safe to avoid Cat's [[cyberbullying]], and Sofia throws the keys to the safe in the house's swimming pool.

After Dr. White receives a frantic voicemail from Cat, he returns to the house and interrogates the girls about his daughter's whereabouts. He tells the girls he is going to press charges. Sam goes to search for Cat in the woods, and finds Sofia's father's car parked, with blood across the windshield. She returns to the house panicked, but the girls don't believe her.

Georgie and Francesca begin to taunt Sofia about her mother's alleged affair with Dr. White, and she leaves. In the woods, Sofia also stumbles upon her father's car, and finds his corpse inside. She calls her mother; Alex answers, believing it to be her husband, and angrily yells into the phone about his cheating and hangs up. Sofia takes a revolver from the car and flees. At the house, Sam stumbles upon Ava's dead body, and is attacked by a masked assailant. She goes to retrieve the safe key from the pool to get the girls' cell phones back.

Georgie has her throat slashed; Francesca is also stabbed to death. Both of their deaths are [[live stream|streamed]] on the internet, and photos of their bodies posted online. Sam retrieves the key and opens the safe, but is attacked again, and locks herself inside. On her phone, she finds photos and video of her friends' murders posted on a social media game by Cat. Dr. White returns to the house, and finds Georgie's body. Sam tells him that Cat has killed Ava and Georgie; Cat emerges and unmasks herself. Believing that Dr. White murdered her father, Sofia shoots him to death. Witnessing this, Cat flees; Sofia then learns that Cat is the murderer.

Sam leaves the house to get help. She encounters Cat on the road, wearing the mask. Alex arrives and witnesses Cat shoot herself in the mouth, killing herself. The film ends with a montage of photos of the murders, followed by a video uploaded by Cat, in which she professes her revenge against the girls, and says that she will "be remembered forever."

==Production==

===Conception===
In February 2014, it was announced that [[Tara Subkoff]] had written and was going to direct a film starring [[Chloë Sevigny]], [[Timothy Hutton]], [[Balthazar Getty]], [[Natasha Lyonne]], [[Taryn Manning]], [[Stella Schnabel]], [[Lydia Hearst]], and Annabelle Dexter-Jones. Screenwriter Casey Barnhart was brought in to do an uncredited rewrite before production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/02/chloe-sevigny-timothy-hutton-top-horror-noir-thriller-680608/|title=Chloe Sevigny, Timothy Hutton top '#Horror' Noir Thriller|work=Deadline.com|first=Mike|last=Fleming Jr|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later interview with ''[[Elle magazine|Elle]]'', Subkoff stated that she was inspired to write the film after a discussion she'd had with one of her friends' daughters, who had been [[cyberbullying|cyberbullied]].&lt;ref name="elle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/interviews/a28601/tara-subkoff-horror-interview/|work=Elle|title=EXCLUSIVE: A FIRST LOOK AT TARA SUBKOFF'S MILLENNIAL HORROR FLICK STARRING CHLOË SEVIGNY|date=May 29, 2015|author=Krentcil, Faran|accessdate=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[The idea] started because I asked my friend's daughter, "What is horror, to you?" This girl was cyberbullied very badly... Now, I was bullied badly as a kid, but I could always change schools. I could always go home. Now you can't…when bullying follows you home, and there's no escape and no end, to me, that's horror. And to so many girls, that's just life."&lt;ref name="elle"/&gt;

===Filming===
The film was shot in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Connecticut]] over a period of eighteen days during the winter of 2015.&lt;ref name="nyhf"&gt;{{cite speech

===Post-production===
Subkoff spent nearly seven months editing the film with her editors Janice Hampton and Catrin Hedstrom.&lt;ref name="hirschberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmagazine.com/people/2015/11/tara-subkoff-horror-fillm/photos/|title=The Art of Being Tara Subkoff|first=Lynn|last=Hirschberg|publisher=WMagazine.com|date=November 19, 2015|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animated sequences in the film were designed by artist Tabor Robak.&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt;

[[Erika M. Anderson|EMA]] composed the score of the film, EMA stated: "Film work and scoring is fun for me because I get to make all this music that wouldn’t necessarily fit on an EMA record. We worked really closely with Tara Subkoff on the music. She definitely always had an opinion on what she liked and what she didn’t. It was my first score, so I’m not sure if all composers end up spending weeks in a room with the director, but that’s how we did it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/11/ema-shares-amnesia-haze-from-the-soundtrack-to-horror-listen/|title=EMA shares “Amnesia Haze" from the soundtrack to #Horror — listen|publisher=CosequenceOfSound.net|first=Ben|last=Kaye|date=November 20, 2015|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
''#Horror'' received mixed reviews from the critics. It holds a 45% rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/771432133/|title=#Horror (2015)|publisher=RottenTomatoes.com|accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film holds a rating of 42 out of 100, based on 7 critics indicating "mixed or average reviews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= #Horror Reviews |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/horror|publisher=Metacritic.com|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a negative review, writing: "Infusing its generic horror tropes with vaguely satirical aspects, the film doesn't really work on either level. Unintentionally campy (or purposely, it's hard to tell) and marred by ridiculous plotting and dialogue, #Horror is mostly just a horror."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/horror-film-review-842276|title='#Horror': Film Review|publisher=[[TheHollywoodReporter.com]]|first=Frank|last=Scheck|date=November 19, 2015|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christine N. Ziemba of ''[[Paste Magazine]]'' gave the film a mixed review, writing: "It’s a familiar trope—the killer in the woods hunting a bunch of school girls left home alone—and so much less terrifying than kids armed with their phones, social media accounts, and snark and spite. Despite the issues with #Horror’s plot and some of the performances, we’re still interested in seeing what Subkoff takes on next. She’s self-assured behind the camera with an eye for detail, and developing a distinctive, sleek style that’s worth a second chance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/11/horror.html|title=#Horror|publisher=Pastemagazine.com|first=Christine N.|last=Ziemba|date=November 25, 2015|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite mixed and negative reviews, Inkoo Kang of ''[[TheWrap.com]]'' gave the film a positive review, writing: "And yet, “#Horror” undeniably succeeds in its main mission: parodying and scrutinizing the ease with which we capture, recycle, reframe, and desensitize ourselves to even the most horrific images. That makes [[Blingee]] possibly the scariest website out there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/horror-review-chloe-sevigny-timothy-hutton-balthazar-getty/|title=‘#Horror’ Review: Chloe Sevigny Gets Embroiled in Cyber-Bullying That Escalates|publisher=TheWrap.com|first=Inkoo|last=Kang|date=November 19, 2015|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Husayn Pasha ibn Makki''' (also known as '''Mekkizâde Hüseyin Paşa''') (died 1765) served as the Ottoman ''[[wali]]'' (provincial governor) of [[Damascus Eyalet|Damascus]] (1757) and [[Marash Eyalet|Marash]] (1762), and the ''[[sanjak-bey]]'' (district governor) of his native [[Gaza Sanjak|Gaza]] (1763–1765). 

==Origins==
Husayn Pasha ibn Makki was an [[Arab]] from [[Gaza City|Gaza]], and one of the few ethnic Arab governors (the other Arab governors were mostly members of the [[al-Azm]] family) who had governed Ottoman Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=osFQAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Husayn+Pasha+Makki+%22Palestine%2C+as+from%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Palestine%2C+as+from%22|title=JCAS Symposium Series|publisher=Japan Center for Area Studies, National Museum of Ethnology|issue=7|year=2003|isbn=9784901838023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor of Damascus==
Husayn Pasha was appointed Governor of Damascus in February 1757 to replace the deposed long-time governor, [[As'ad Pasha al-Azm]]. His term in office was short-lived and marked by chaos and violence in the city of [[Damascus]]. As he entered office a price hike for bread in the city spiked due to the short supply of grain as a result of the severe winter that preceded his rule. A popular uprising protesting the prices took place in the city. Damascene notables heading to Husayn Pasha's residence to welcome him were assaulted by some protesters and vocally condemned for alleged grain hoarding and "exploiting the poor and miserable".&lt;ref name="Grehan90"&gt;Grehan 2007, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Husayn Pasha responded by ordering an investigation and soon after the prices decreased and calm was restored. However, this was short-lived and the prices rose within a few months. In the summer of 1757, mass violence spread throughout Damascus as rival factions of [[Jannisary|Jannisaries]] fought each other and besieged rival neighborhoods, while a popular revolt caused many mercenaries stationed in the city to flee.&lt;ref name="Grehan90"/&gt;

===Assault of the Hajj caravan===
{{main|1757 Hajj caravan raid}}

As Governor of Damascus, Husayn Pasha was also the ''[[amir al-hajj]]'' (commander of the annual [[Hajj]] pilgrim caravan to [[Mecca]]). In April 1757, he went on a tour of the province's villages to collect the taxes imposed for funding the supply and protection of the caravan, and in June he led the caravan in its departure from Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Joudah 1987, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Husayn Pasha led it safely to Mecca, but on the return to Damascus, the caravan's ''jurdah'' (advance guard) was assaulted by a coalition of [[Bedouin]] tribes led Qa'dan al-Fa'iz of the [[Beni Sakhr|Bani Sakhr]] in al-Qatranah near [[al-Karak]]. Its commander Musa Pasha was wounded and died seeking help in [[Daraa]], while most of the ''jurdah'' dispersed, fleeing to [[Hauran]], Gaza, [[Jerusalem]] or [[Ma'an]]. Reinforcements were sent from Damascus, but went no further than [[Salt, Jordan|al-Balqa]]. When Husayn Pasha, now in the northern [[Hejaz]], realized reinforcements were not arriving, he attempted to bribe al-Fa'iz, but to no avail. The Bedouin tribes launched a [[1757 Hajj caravan raid|massive assault]] against the caravan south of [[Tabuk, Saudi Arabia|Tabuk]] in October, looting it and massacred Muslim pilgrims, including the sister of Ottoman sultan [[Osman II]], in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Joudah 1987, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; About 20,000 pilgrims were killed by the Bedouin or died of thirst or excessive heat.&lt;ref name="Barbir30"&gt;Barbir 2014, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were various reasons the Bedouin launched the assault, but the main reason was the financial gain they saw in looting the caravan to compensate for the loss of much of their territory and income to the [[Anizzah]] tribes of [[Najd]], who invaded much of the [[Syrian Desert]] in the years prior. Prior to making the Hajj, Husayn Pasha refused to pay the traditional protection fee to the Bani Saqr, paying the Anizzah instead. However, Husayn Pasha held the autonomous Arab ruler of northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Zahir al-Umar]], as culpable. Husayn Pasha saw it as a priority to subdue Zahir and annex his territories (which were part of [[Sidon Eyalet]]) and believed Zahir, who maintained close ties with the Bani Saqr, incited the Bedouin tribes to raid the caravan. Zahir denied the allegation and purchased the looted goods, including Sultan Osman III's decorated banner, in order to return them to the sultanate and prove his loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Joudah 1987, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman authorities remained suspicious of Zahir nonetheless,&lt;ref name="Joudah42"&gt;Joudah 1987, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and also believed that ex-governor As'ad Pasha had a hand in the raid since no attacks against the caravan had occurred during his 15-year governorship. The latter was arrested and was executed on the way to a prison in [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;Joudah 1987, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Husayn Pasha did not return to Damascus with the surviving pilgrims and his absence left a political void in the city. The ''[[yerliyya]]'' Jannisaries revolted, causing businesses in Damascus to shutter and prices of bread to more than double, leading to more riots in the city.&lt;ref name="Grehan90"/&gt; As a result of his failure to protect the caravan, Husayn Pasha was dismissed from office by the end of the year.&lt;ref name="Joudah42"/&gt;

==Later career==
Husayn Pasha was exiled to his native Gaza after his dismissal,&lt;ref name="Barbir30"/&gt; but was later assigned Governor of [[Marash Eyalet]] in [[Anatolia]] in 1762. He served there for less than a year before being appointed ''[[sanjak-bey]]'' (district governor) of Gaza.&lt;ref name="Barbir30"/&gt; He served as Governor of Gaza until he was killed in a confrontation with the Bani Sakhr and Wuhaydat tribes&lt;ref name="Joudah42"/&gt; in Gaza's general vicinity in 1765.&lt;ref name="Barbir30"/&gt;

In [[developmental biology]], '''invagination''' is a mechanism that takes place during [[gastrulation]]. This mechanism or cell movement happens mostly in the [[vegetal pole]]. Invagination consists of the folding of an area of the exterior sheet of cells towards the inside of the [[blastula]]. In each organism, the complexity will be different depending on the number of cells. Invagination can be referenced as one of the steps of the establishment of the body plan.&lt;ref name="Sinauer Associates Inc"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=Scott |last2=Rauno |first2=Anne |date=1997 |title=Embryology, Constructing the Organism |format=book |language=english |location=Sunderland, MA. |publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc. |isbn=0-87893-237-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=Scott |last2=Barresi |first2=Michael |date=2016 |title=Developmental Biology |format=book |language=English |location=Massachusetts |publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc. |isbn=9781605354705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, originally used in [[embryology]], has been adopted in other disciplines as well. 
There is more than one type of movement for invagination. Two common types are axial and orthogonal. The difference between the production of the tube formed in the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Axial can be formed at a single point along the axis of a surface. Orthogonal is linear and trough.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie A. Davies, In Mechanisms of Morphogensis (Second Edition), 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
* Invagination is the [[morphogenetic]] processes by which an [[embryo]] takes form, and is the initial step of [[gastrulation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alberts|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|year=2002|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; the massive reorganization of the embryo from a simple spherical ball of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], the [[blastula]], into a multi-layered [[organism]], with differentiated [[germ layer]]s: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm.  More localized invaginations also occur later in embryonic development,
* The inner membrane of a [[mitochondrion]] '''invaginates''' to form [[crista]]e, thus providing a much greater surface area to accommodate the protein complexes and other participants that produce [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cronk|first=Jeff|title=Biochemistry Dictionary|url=http://guweb2.gonzaga.edu/faculty/cronk/biochem/M-index.cfm?definition=mitochondria|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114235521/http://guweb2.gonzaga.edu/faculty/cronk/biochem/M-index.cfm?definition=mitochondria|archivedate=2012-11-14|df=}}[dead link]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Invagination occurs during [[endocytosis]] and [[exocytosis]] when a vesicle forms within the cell and the membrane closes around it.
* Invagination of a part of the [[intestine]] into another part is called [[Intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blanco|first=Felix|title=Intussusception|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/930708-overview|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphioxus===
[[File:Invagination.jpg|thumb|Invagination process in Amphioxus]]
The invagination in ''Amphioxus'' is the first cell movement of [[gastrulation]]. This process was first described by Conklin. During [[gastrulation]], the [[blastula]] will be transformed by the invagination. The [[endoderm]] will fold towards the inner part and that way the [[blastocoel]] will be gone transforming into like a cup-shaped structure with a double wall. The inner wall will be called the [[archenteron]]; the primitive gut. The [[archenteron]] will open to the exterior through the [[blastopore]]. The outer wall will become the [[ectoderm]]. Later forming the [[epidermis]] and [[neural crest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Browder |first=Leon |date=1984 |title=Developmental Biology |location=Canada |publisher=CBS College Publishing |page=599 |isbn= 4833702010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tunicates===
In tunicates, invagination is the first mechanism that takes place during [[gastrulation]]. The four largest [[endoderm]] cells induce the invagination process in the [[tunicates]]. Invagination consists of the internal movements of a sheet of cells (the [[endoderm]]) based on changes in their shape. The [[blastula]] of the tunicates is a little flattened in the [[vegetal pole]] making a change of shape from a columnar to a wedge shape. Once the [[endoderm]] cells were invaginated, the cells will keep moving beneath the [[ectoderm]]. Later, the [[blastopore]] will be formed and with this, the invagination process is complete. The [[blastopore]] will be surrounded by the [[mesoderm]] by all sides.&lt;ref name="Sinauer Associates Inc"/&gt;

==Philosophy&lt;!-- 'Invagination (philosophy)' redirects here --&gt;==
In [[Continental philosophy]], the term '''invagination'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is used to explain a special kind of [[metanarrative]]. It was first used by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merleau-Ponty|first=Maurice|title=The Visible and the Invisible|year=1968|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0810104571|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|invagination}}) to describe the dynamic self-differentiation of the 'flesh'. It was later used by [[Rosalind E. Krauss]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] ("The Law of Genre", ''Glyph 7'', 1980); for Derrida, an invaginated text is a narrative that folds upon itself, "endlessly swapping outside for inside and thereby producing a structure ''[[Mise en abyme|en abyme]]''".&lt;ref name=chaplin&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaplin|first=Susan|title=Law, Sensibility, and the Sublime in Eighteenth-Century Women's Fiction: Speaking of Dread|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zOqNqq4i2ioC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=12 January 2013|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754633068|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He applies the term to such texts as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''&lt;ref name=chaplin/&gt; and [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s ''La Folie du Jour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Amelia|title=The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5zCts8ax58C&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=12 January 2013|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415267069|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invagination is an aspect of [[différance]], since according to Derrida it opens the "inside" to the "other" and denies both inside and outside a stable identity.&lt;ref name=wortham&gt;{{cite book|last=Wortham|first=Simon Morgan|title=The Derrida Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVtjXOyPSMAC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=12 January 2013|year=2010|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=9781847065261|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Nilsson was active in the dramatic arts from a very young age. He was cast as Eric Singer, one of the central characters in the [[Disney]] TV movie ''[[Model Behavior]]'', which was released on 12 March 2000 in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218121/ Model Behavior (2000) (TV)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the television show ''[[Our Hero]]'', which ran from 2000 to 2002, Nilsson played the part of casual-warm and a super-supportive Rollins, an animal rescue guy who "knows way too much about raccoon poop".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourhero.tv/theheroes/index.html THE HEROES cast page showing Jesse Nilsson]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nilsson's last major role was as Gabriel Patterson on ''[[Adventure Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventure-inc.net/cast/index.html Fansite dedicated to ADVENTURE INC. Jesse Nilsson bio]&lt;/ref&gt; He died from pneumonia-related heart failure on April 25, 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0632235/bio|title=Jesse Nilsson - Biography|access-date=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[North York]], [[Ontario]] before the 22nd and final episode, "Trapped", had been broadcast, its original airdate being May 12, 2003. Nilsson was 25 years old. A tribute was added to the last few frames of this episode showing a picture of Nilsson under which was written "In memory of Jesse Nilsson 1977-2003".

'''John Paul''' was a pioneer in [[Ohio]] and [[Indiana]], founding [[Xenia, Ohio]] and [[Madison, Indiana]]. He was a delegate at the convention that drafted the constitution of Ohio, and was a state senator in the first general assembly after statehood. He also served in the first state senate of Indiana. He founded the second newspaper in Indiana. He was known as "Colonel John Paul" for his services in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]].

==Youth==
John Paul was the fourth of seven children of Michael Paul, a native of [[Holland]], and Ann Parker, a native of [[Germantown, Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] They were married at Germantown in about 1751 or 1752, and John Paul was born in Germantown on November 12, 1758.{{sfn|Hendricks}} In 1766 or 1767, the family moved to Redstone, Old Fort, now [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania|Brownsville]], [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Milligan|p=74}}

==Revolutionary War==
In 1778, Paul joined [[George Rogers Clark]] in the [[Illinois campaign]], a series of battles during the [[American Revolutionary War]], culminating with the capture of the town of [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]] and British fort at [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] in 1779.{{sfn|Milligan|p=75}}

==Life in Kentucky==
In 1781, Paul's family moved to [[Kentucky]], and settled at what would later be [[Hardin County, Kentucky|Hardin County]]. Kentucky achieved statehood in 1792, and Hardin County was established the next year. Paul was the first clerk and recorder of the county.{{sfn|Milligan|p=75}} In 1794, he married Sarah Thornberry Grover. They had four children, with the eldest, Mary Berry, dying young.{{sfn|Hendricks}}

==Life in Ohio==
In 1800, Paul moved to the [[Northwest Territory]], in what was then [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]], but would later be [[Greene County, Ohio]]. He was nominated in 1802 by the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] convention as a delegate to the [[Ohio Constitutional Convention (1802)|convention]] that would write a constitution for the proposed state of Ohio. He received the second highest number of votes.{{sfn|Milligan|p=75}} He voted to allow civil right for Black people in the new state.{{sfn|Convention|p=116}}

Paul was elected one of four Hamilton County members of the [[Ohio State Senate]] for the first general assembly in 1803.{{sfn|General Assembly|p=217}} Greene County was created during this assembly.{{sfn|Milligan|p=76}} Paul was appointed first county recorder and clerk of courts for the county, and was clerk for the county commissioners.{{sfn|Milligan|p=76-77}} The county seat was located on land owned by Paul, where the first building of the village of [[Xenia, Ohio]] was erected in 1804.{{sfn|Milligan|p=77}}

==Life in Indiana==
Paul moved to [[Indiana Territory]] in 1809, and established the village of [[Madison, Indiana|Madison]]. He established the first ferry from Madison to Kentucky across the [[Ohio River]] in 1811.{{sfn|Jefferson Library}} He also established a grist mill and saw mill before enlisting as a volunteer in the [[War of 1812]] in 1812.{{sfn|Jefferson Library}} He commanded a regiment under General [[William Henry Harrison]] in [[Northwest Ohio]] during the siege of [[Fort Meigs]] and the attack on [[Fort Stephenson]]. He was thereafter referred to as "Colonel John Paul".{{sfn|Milligan|p=78}}

In 1813, Paul established the second newspaper in Indiana, the "Western Eagle", and in 1814 he was named president of the first bank in the village.{{sfn|Jefferson Library}} In 1816, [[Indiana]] became a state, and Paul was elected to the first state senate, where he was the presiding officer.{{sfn|Milligan|p=77}}

Paul made a trip on horseback to view some horses he was considering buying. His horse swam a flood swollen creek, but Paul fell and struck his head on a stone. He was found unconscious and soaking wet some hours later, and suffered from rheumatism for three years before his death in Madison on June 6, 1830. He was buried at city cemetery.{{sfn|Jefferson Library}} In 1904, the city removed all burials to Fairmont Cemetery, and the original cemetery became "John Paul Park" in Madison.{{sfn|National Park}}

==Legacy==
In 1816, Paul's daughter, Ann Parker Paul was married to [[William Hendricks]]. He was a senator and governor of Indiana.{{sfn|Hendricks}}

During the afternoon [[rush hour]] of June 22, 2009, a [[Rapid transit|subway]] [[train wreck|train-on-train collision]] occurred between two southbound [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]] [[Washington Metro]] trains in [[Northeast, Washington, D.C.]], United States. A moving train collided with a train stopped ahead of it; the train operator along with eight passengers were killed, and 80 people were injured, making it the deadliest crash in the history of the Washington Metro.

The NTSB investigation found that after a June 17 replacement of a [[track circuit]] component at what became the site of the June 22 collision, the track circuit had been suffering from [[parasitic oscillation]]s which left it unable to reliably report when that stretch of track was occupied by a train. The struck train came to a stop because of traffic ahead. Because the entire train was within the faulty circuit, it became invisible to the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system. The train behind it was therefore commanded to proceed at 55&amp;nbsp;mph. The operator of the striking train applied the emergency brake after the stopped train came into full view but there was not enough time to prevent the collision, which occurred at approximately 44&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name=NTSBreport&gt;{{cite web|title=NTSB Railroad Accident Report: Collision of Two Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Metrorail Trains Near Fort Totten Station|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/RAR1002.pdf|author=NTSB|date=July 27, 2010|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NTSB found that Train 214 had come to a stop entirely within the faulty circuit B2-304, making it effectively invisible to the automatic train control system. Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum to make it to the next circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system. Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator, and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit B2-304 and was therefore invisible. Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track. The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but it was too late to avert the collision.&lt;ref name=NTSBreport/&gt;

A series of almost-collisions in 2005 in similar circumstances in the tunnel between Foggy Bottom and Rosslyn stations led to a new test procedure which would have identified the faulty circuit after installation. However, by 2009, Metro engineers were unaware of this incident or the tests developed to detect the failure condition.&lt;ref name=NTSBreport/&gt;

Dennis Oglesby and Martin Griffith, two [[United States Army]] soldiers who were in the lead train and were uninjured in the collision, helped passengers, most of whom appeared to have minor injuries, evacuate from their train. Oglesby and Griffith then noticed that six to eight people from the other train had been ejected by the force of the collision and were more seriously injured. One person from the overtaking train had been thrown onto the roof of the stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound. The soldiers gave first aid to the more seriously injured victims until help arrived, and informed responding emergency personnel that the rails were still powered and needed to be shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Matthew, "[http://militarytimes.com/news/2009/08/army_metrocrash_082309w/ Soldiers jumped into action after D.C. crash]", ''[[Military Times]]'', August 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the incident, WMATA General Manager John Catoe stated that the cause was not known but that "the system is safe."&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124570674389438637?mod=googlenews_wsj D.C.

June 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) began an investigation.&lt;ref name="WashPost" /&gt; WMATA and NTSB investigators considered several possible causes, which might include operator error, brake failure, fault in the [[Washington Metro signaling and operation|computerized signal and operation system]], or a combination of the three. During rush hour operation, train movement is typically controlled by a centralized computer system, and a separate decentralized system can automatically apply the brakes to prevent a collision. These systems had failed at least once in the past, and the NTSB subsequently identified incompatible specifications, from the maximum deceleration capability of the trains to the deceleration rates used in the wayside system design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lindsey |last=Layton |title=THE PROBE: Experts Suspect Failure Of Signal System, Operator Error |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/22/AR2009062203261.html? |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j6Bv2Jt4?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/22/AR2009062203261.html |archivedate=August 17, 2009 |deadurl=no |date=June 23, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trouble in Tunnel Delaying Subway|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/13/AR2005061301564.html|accessdate=June 22, 2009|date=June 14, 2005|work=The Washington Post|first=Lindsey|last=Layton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NTSB: Train's Emergency Brake Was On |url=http://www.myfoxdc.com/dpp/news/062309_ntsb_eyeing_standards_after_metro_crash |publisher=[[Fox Television Stations]], Inc |date=June 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j6Bw9e0N?url=http://www.myfoxdc.com/dpp/news/062309_ntsb_eyeing_standards_after_metro_crash |archivedate=August 17, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The train has a manual emergency brake, which can be applied by the driver in the event of an imminent collision, if the driver can see and identify the hazard with sufficient time to stop.

It recommended refurbishment of the entire series after a 2004 collision at the [[Woodley Park (WMATA station)|Woodley Park]] station in which a 1000-Series Rohr car telescoped into another train.&lt;ref name="CityPaper" /&gt; In this case, NTSB's Hersman confirmed that, "the first car [of the striking train] overrode the rear car [of the struck train], and much of the survivable space on that first car of the striking train was compromised".&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; The NTSB called for the accelerated retirement of the 1000-Series cars, or urged that they be "retrofitted with [[crashworthiness]] collision protection that is comparable to [[Washington Metro rolling stock#6000-Series|6000-Series car]] railcars."&lt;ref name="NTSB"&gt;{{cite web|author=NTSB |title=NTSB Determines that the Operator's Failure to Apply Brakes Caused Washington Subway Collision in 2004 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=March 23, 2006 |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/Pressrel/2006/060323.htm |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j6BtXfC6?url=http://www.ntsb.gov/Pressrel/2006/060323.htm |archivedate=August 17, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the 1000-Series cars lack data recorders that could be used in determining the cause of a crash.&lt;ref name="WashPost" /&gt; During the press conference, Catoe stated that he had "no basis to suspend the use of 1000-Series cars at this time".&lt;ref name="CityPaper"&gt;[http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2009/06/22/old-questions-about-crashworthiness-of-metro-cars/#more-25361 DeBonis, Mike.

[[File:King Clone.jpg|thumb|King Clone, the 11,700-year-old [[Larrea tridentata|creosote bush]] ring in the [[Mojave Desert]]]]

'''King Clone''' is thought to be the oldest [[Larrea tridentata|creosote bush]] ring in the [[Mojave Desert]]. The ring is estimated to be 11,700 years old, making it one of the [[List of long-living organisms|oldest living organisms on Earth]]. This single [[clonal colony]] plant of ''[[Larrea tridentata]]'' reaches up to {{convert|67|ft|m|abbr=off}} in diameter, with an average diameter of {{convert|45|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Creosote Bush: Long-Lived Clones in the Mojave Desert, Frank C.

== Geography ==

The King Clone ring is on restricted-access public land in the central Mojave Desert, about 0.6 miles north of California Route 247 on Bessemer Mine Road near the towns of [[Lucerne Valley, California|Lucerne Valley]] and [[Landers, California|Landers]]. It is within the Creosote Rings Preserve&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lucernevalley.net/creosote/index.htm |title = Creosote Rings Preserve, Lucerne Valley / Johnson Valley |author =  |date =  |work = lucernevalley.net |accessdate = March 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Lucerne Valley and Johnson Valley.&lt;ref name="creosote" /&gt;

== Dating methodology ==

King Clone was identified and the age estimated by [[Frank Vasek]], a professor at the [[University of California, Riverside]]. After Vasek hypothesized that the creosote ring was, in fact, one organism, [[Leonel da Silveira Lobo O'Reilly Sternberg]] (then a graduate student working in Vasek's lab), documented that plants within a ring had more similar  characteristics, than those from other plant clusters.  Vasek then used two methods to estimate the age of the ring.  One method counted [[Dendrochronology|rings]] and measured the distance of annual growth, and the other used [[radiocarbon dating]] on pieces of wood found in the center of the ring, and measuring their distance from each other and the living bushes.  The two dating methods yielded similar results (age about 11,700 years).&lt;ref name="creosote" /&gt;

The '''Lincoln Oak''' was an oak tree in [[Bloomington, Illinois]]. Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln both gave speeches at the tree during the 1850s. The original Lincoln Oak died in 1976.

==History==
The Lincoln Oak was an [[oak tree]] located in [[Bloomington, Illinois]], that was the site of several speeches by [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] between 1855 and 1860&lt;ref name=plaque/&gt;&lt;ref name=nrhp/&gt; The tree was located in an area of Bloomington known as Dimmett's Grove when Lincoln and Douglas spoke there. In 1869, near the oak, the [[Vrooman Mansion]] was built.&lt;ref name=nrhp/&gt; The house still overlooks the site of the Lincoln Oak today.&lt;ref name=nrhp/&gt; The original Lincoln Oak died in 1976;&lt;ref name=nrhp/&gt; in 1980 a new oak tree was planted in honor of the original Lincoln Oak.&lt;ref name=plaque/&gt;

==Memorial and park==
[[Vachel Lindsay]] was the dedication speaker at a 1914 ceremony in which a plaque was affixed to the original Lincoln Oak.&lt;ref name=nrhp/&gt; The plaque featured a quote from [[Adlai Stevenson I]] concerning the Lincoln Oak:&lt;ref name=nrhp/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;I have heard Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln at different times speak from a platform erected under the shade of this tree. This historic spot was then a part of Dimmett's Grove.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1966 the 32 foot by 32 foot parcel of the Vrooman Mansion lot containing the oak was deeded to the city of Bloomington.&lt;ref name=nrhp&gt;Polite, Bettie S. and George W.

'''Manuel Abad y Queipo''' (August 26, 1751 – September 15, 1825) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[Bishop of Michoacán]] in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] at the time of the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. He was "an acute social commentator of late colonial Mexico, ... an exemplification of the enlightened clergyman."&lt;ref&gt;R. Douglas Cope, "Manuel Abad y Queipo" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 1, p. 1, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early career==
Born in Asturias in the 18th century, Manuel Abad y Queipo was [[Legitimacy (family law)|born out of wedlock]] to an Asturian nobleman.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State, 1492–1867''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained his baccalaureate in law and canon law from the [[University of Salamanca]]. Thereafter he went to [[Guatemala]] with Bishop Monroy. In Guatemala he was ordained a priest. Beginning in 1784 he resided in Valladolid (now [[Morelia]]), where Bishop Antonio San Miguel made him a judge in a canon law court. In that position he gained considerable knowledge about church wealth in terms of capital and credit. In 1805 he obtained a doctorate in canon law from the [[University of Guadalajara]]. In 1810 he was nominated as Bishop-elect of Michoacan, but was never confirmed in the post.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''The First America'', p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; On the death of Bishop San Miguel, the [[Council of the Indies]] named him canon of the cathedral of Valladolid, a position which he held until 1815.

In 1807 he traveled to Spain to seek his habilitation, since his status as a child born out of wedlock prohibited his promotion to the higher levels of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. He returned to New Spain in the position of vicar general.

In 1810 the Regency (the Spanish government fighting the French invasion) named him bishop-elect of Michoacán. He took over the diocese before the arrival of the pontifical bull confirming his position. The pope did not approve his nomination, and thus the bull never arrived.

==Political activity in New Spain==
[[File:Carlos IV de rojo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles IV of Spain]]]]
[[File:Alexandre humboldt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander von Humboldt]], whose ''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain'' was influenced by Abad y Queipo's writings]]
Although born in Spain, Abad y Queipo felt at home in New Spain, saying he was "an American by voluntary adoption."&lt;ref&gt;Hugh M. Hamill, ''The Hidalgo Revolt'' Westport CT: Greenwood Press 1966, p. 156 quoting J.E. Hernández y Dávalos, ''Colección de documentos para la historia de la guerra de independencia de México de 1808–1821''. vol. II, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  He had strong views about New Spain and its place within the Spanish empire, saying that the crown gave Mexico's indigenous equal rights with the conquering Spaniards and that Spain despite its decline had "made the American possessions flourish until they were the envy of Europeans."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Lillian Fisher, ''The Background of the Revolution for Mexican Independence''. Boston: Christopher Publishing House 1934, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the decline of Spain could be attributed to emigration to the overseas territories.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, ''The Background of the Revolution for Mexican Independence'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He critiqued economic inequality in New Spain, "in America there is no graduation or middle ground: everyone is either rich or poverty stricken, noble or infamous" leading to conflict.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''The First America'', p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1799 he wrote to King [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] a report entitled ''Representación al rey, sobre immunidades del clero'' (''Description to the King, of the Immunities of the Clergy''). In this document he outlined the social and political situation in New Spain and explained the symptoms of discontent. He proposed the general abolition of tribute levied on the [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]]; the free distribution of royal lands; [[agrarian land reform in Mexico]] that would permit poor people to obtain 20- or 30-year "leases" on uncultivated land belonging to the large landowners, but without paying rent; and the right to establish cotton and woolen mills.

In 1804 he opposed [[Manuel de Godoy|Godoy]]'s ''Cédula de la Caja de Consolidación''. The Act of Consolidation sought to transfer wealth from the church to the crown by calling in all mortgages that were held by the church, which was a direct attack on the elite land holders in New Spain whose wealth was invested in haciendas and whose mortgages held by the church. This order was the equivalent of [[Fee tail|disentailment]] of the church because it ordered the transfer of income from the religious estates and foundations to the government, but its attack on the land holding elites' source of wealth did not shore up their loyalty to the crown. Abad y Queipo's memorial to the crown "pointed out that the withdrawal of the vast loans of the Church would paralyze agriculture and business."&lt;ref&gt;J. Lloyd Mecham, ''Church and State in Latin America, second edition''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 1966, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1805 and 1807 he forwarded two other reports to the king.

His writings critiquing society in New Spain influenced [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who spent a year in the viceroyalty 1803–04. Abad y Queipo presented Humboldt with his published writings when the cleric visited Paris in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], '' Church and State in Bourbon Mexico: The Diocese of Michoacán 1749–1810''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1994, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt's ''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain'' was one of his first publications from his five-year sojourn to Spanish America and drew heavily on Abad's memorials.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''The First America: Spanish Monarchs, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State, 1492–1867''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1991, 527.&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt took Abad y Queipo's argument about the low condition of Mexico's indigenous population as impeding progress in the viceroyalty, which Abad had first mentioned in a 1799 memorial to Bishop Antonio de San Miguel. Their multiple languages, ties to their home communities, collective land tenure which the crown had protected now were their chains preventing individual advancement.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''The First America'', p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Abad y Queipo deplored the situation of the Indians, he did not blame them for it, viewing it not due to inherent racial or character flaws but to crown protectionism.  Abad y Queipo drew on the writings of reformist Spaniard [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]]'s ''Informe de ley agraria''.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''The First America'', p. 568.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also influenced by [[Adam Smith]]'s ''The Wealth of Nations'' and drew on the writings of [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''The First America'', p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; The replication of Abad y Queipo's arguments in Humboldt's work doubtless gave them a larger audience than they previously garnered.

==During New Spain's insurgency==
[[File:Guadalupano.jpg|Guadalupanflag|thumb|250px|Banner with the image of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|the Virgin of Guadalupe]] carried by [[Miguel Hidalgo]] and his insurgent followers, an act Abad y Queipo denounced as a sacrilege.]]
The [[Bourbon Reforms]] had resulted in the virtual exclusion of American-born Spanish men from attaining high office, and increased alienation between peninsular-born Spaniards and the American-born.  Abad y Queipo recognized the ''criollos''' resentment and suggested that the rift be softened by sending criollos to Spain for education and that the crown appoint elite criollos to high positions in the government in Spain, in the military and the Catholic Church, as well as allowing those in New Spain to be appointed to high office in Peru and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, ''The Background of the Revolution for Mexican Independence'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  The increasing alienation of criollos from the Spanish crown flared into open rebellion in 1810 with the revolt of secular priest [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Miguel Hidalgo]].

Abad y Queipo had been friends with [[Miguel Hidalgo|Hidalgo]], who had come before the Inquisition. With the outbreak of violence led by Hidalgo in September 1810, Abad y Queipo himself came under suspicion and was denounced to the Inquisition by Fermín Peñalosa y Antón for his being "delinquent in matters of faith."&lt;ref&gt;Hamill, ''The Hidalgo Revolt'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Abad y Queipo strongly and energetically opposed the violent movement for Mexican independence from Spain. This was perhaps due his belief that the economic and social progress he sought was threatened with destruction by movement led by his friend Hidalgo.&lt;ref&gt;Hamill, ''The Hidalgo Revolt'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Abad had also sought the friendship of members of the revolutionary juntas of Valladolid (now Morelia) and [[San Miguel de Allende|San Miguel el Grande]] (now San Miguel de Allende).

On 24 September 1810, Abad y Queipo published the decree excommunicating insurgents Hidalgo, [[Ignacio Allende]], [[Juan Aldama]], and [[Mariano Abasolo]]. Hidalgo's excommunication was for Hidalgo's having "raised a standard of rebellion and seduced a number of innocent people," but it was for rebellion against the crown's authority not the Church's.&lt;ref&gt;Mecham, ''Church and State in Latin America'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  The insurgents disputed the legality of the excommunication, based on the lack of papal approval of Abad y Queipo's appointment, which he disputed, and Archbishop Lizana confirmed the order of excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;Mecham, ''Church and State in Latin America'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some prominent parish priests among the insurgents, most especially Hidalgo and [[José María Morelos]]. Abad y Queipo claimed in September 1812 that the majority of priests were loyal to the crown and few were insurgents, saying "even among Jesus's disciples there was a Judas."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in William B. Taylor, ''Magistrates of the Sacred: Priests and Parishioners in Eighteenth-Century Mexico''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1996, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaries, including [[Lucas Alamán]] and later scholars have emphasized priests' participation in the insurgency, and evidence shows that they participated in larger numbers than Abad y Queipo estimated, but in fewer numbers than contemporaries thought.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''Magistrates of the Sacred'', p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1815 Abad y Queipo sent another report to the king ([[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] now), denouncing the mistakes of Viceroy [[Félix María Calleja del Rey, 1st Count of Calderón|Félix María Calleja]] and the lack of prudence of Lardizábal, minister of the Indies. Ferdinand recalled Abad y Queipo to Spain since "he was suspected of dangerous liberal views."&lt;ref&gt;Cope,"Abad y Queipo" p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually confirmed as bishop of [[Michoacan]], but could not return to Mexico. Following Mexican independence in 1821, Abad y Queipo resigned that post and became bishop of [[Tortosa]].&lt;ref&gt;Cope "Abad y Queipo."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Spain==
He obtained an interview with Ferdinand VII, who not only pardoned him, but named him Minister of Grace and Justice in the royal government. This occurred on 24 June 1816, but on 27 June the Inquisition brought its case again, accusing Abad y Queipo of being a friend of the insurgents, living an irreligious life, and holding revolutionary ideas. He was imprisoned two months in the jail of the Inquisition.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The [[Ferdinand VII of Spain#Revolt|Spanish revolution of 1820]] in which the liberal [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] was restored and the crown becoming a [[constitutional monarchy]] again created a provisional junta and Abad y Queipo became a member of the provisional junta.&lt;ref&gt;Cope, "Abad y Queipo"&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with overseeing the conduct of King Ferdinand. Later he was a deputy to the Cortes for the province of Asturias. Even later he was named [[bishop of Tortosa]], but once again the papal bull confirming his position did not arrive.

In 1824 came the absolutist reaction, after Ferdinand was again restored to the throne. Abad y Queipo was now old and deaf, but he was imprisoned again, this time in the monastery of Sisla, in Toledo. He died a prisoner in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;Cope, "Abad y Queipo"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works and legacy==
[[file:José María Luis Mora.png|right|thumb|Nineteenth-century [[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberal]] [[José María Luis Mora]], who republished some of Abad's writings]]
Many of his writings were published in ''Semanario Político y Literario'' (''Political and Literary Seminar'') and in ''Observador de la República Mexicana'' (Observer of the Mexican Republic), the newspaper that [[José María Luis Mora]] edited. The ''Colección de escritos más importantes'' (''Collection of the Most Important Writings'') was published in Mexico City in 1813. His "Testamento político" ("Political Testament") was published in the ''Historia'' of [[Lucas Alamán]]. An important collection of his writings is ''Colección de los escritos mas importantes que en diferentes épocas dirigió al gobierno D. Manual Abad Queipo, obispo electo de Michoacán''.&lt;ref&gt;Mexico 1813, AGI 2571 (96-4-26). Audiencia de Méjico.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[David Brading|D.A. Brading]] notes that Abad y Queipo's writing are notable for "the complete absence of any material dealing with religion."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''The First America'', p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt;  Humboldt read the writings of Abad y Queipo, and the bishop-elect's observations made their way into Humboldt's ''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain''.&lt;ref&gt;Brading, ''The First America'' p. 527&lt;/ref&gt;  Abad y Queipo's writings had a significant impact on [[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberalism]] in the post-independence period, with secular priest and liberal ideologue Mora reprinting  important works, "thereby ensuring their influence over the development of Mexican radicalism...Abad y Queipo is best regarded as the  intellectual progenitor of Mexican Liberalism."&lt;ref&gt;Brading, ''The First America'' pp. 572–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iraqi mass grave.jpg|thumb|Human remains found in at a mass grave site in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], July 15, 2005]]

'''[[Mass grave]]s''' in Iraq have become well known since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq toppled the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]]. International Experts estimated 300,000 victims could be in these mass graves alone. The mass graves mostly included the remains of Shia Muslims and ethnic Kurds killed for opposing the regime between 1983 and 1991, she said.

"PM admits graves claim 'untrue'
Downing Street has admitted to The Observer that repeated claims by Tony Blair that '400,000 bodies had been found in Iraqi mass graves' is untrue, and only about 5,000 corpses have so far been uncovered.
The claims by Blair in November and December of last year, were given widespread credence, quoted by MPs and widely published, including in the introduction to a US government pamphlet on Iraq's mass graves"&lt;ref&gt;Peter Beaumont, foreign affairs editor
The Observer, Saturday 17 July 2004 19.35 EDT&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the information below is taken from [https://web.archive.org/web/20031223200006/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/27000.htm Fact Sheet - Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor and Bureau of Public Affairs]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mass graves in [[Iraq]] are characterized as unmarked sites containing at least six bodies. Some can be identified by mounds of earth piled above the ground or as deep pits that appear to have been filled. Some older graves are more difficult to identify, having been covered by vegetation and debris over time. Sites have been discovered in all regions of the country and contain members of every major religious and ethnic group in Iraq as well as foreign nationals, including [[Kuwait]]is and [[Saudis]]. Over 250 sites have been reported, of which approximately 40 have been confirmed to date. Over one million Iraqis are believed to be missing in Iraq as a result of executions, wars and defections, of whom hundreds of thousands are thought to be in mass graves. Most of the graves discovered to date correspond to one of five major atrocities perpetrated by the regime.

According to [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] in Iraq, many mass graves in [[Kurdistan]] contain [[Kurdish people|Iraqi Kurds]], who were killed in a genocidal act just because of their ethnicity.

*1979 crackdown on Shia political parties and Shia activists. This period involved thousands of "Revolutionary Court" trials which meant  groups of 200-500 Shia young men and women as young as 13 would be hoarded together and sentenced to death.
*1982 the  aggressive tactics by Saddam regime to crush any Shia movements, following the kidnapping and brutal murder of a key Shia Leader Ayatollah Mohamed Baqir Al-Sadr. In this year tens of thousands of Iraq young men, women and children were sentenced to death under the accusation of joining a political party. Those who were lucky - after unimaginable torture and interrogation - would be sentenced to Lifetime imprisonment.
*The 1983 attack against Kurdish citizens belonging to the [[Barzani Kurds|Barzani]] tribe, 8,000 of whom were rounded up by the regime in northern [[Iraq]] and executed in deserts at great distances from their homes. 
*The [[Al-Anfal Campaign|1988 Anfal campaign]], during which as many as 182,000 [[Kurdish people|Iraqi Kurds]] disappeared. Most of the men were separated from their families and were executed in deserts in the west and south-west of [[Iraq]]. The remains of some of their wives and children have also been found in mass graves. 
*[[Chemical warfare|Chemical attacks]] against [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] villages from 1986 to 1988, including the [[Halabja]] attack, when the [[Iraqi Air Force]] dropped [[sarin]], [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] and [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]] chemical agents on the civilian population, killing 5,000 people immediately and causing long-term medical problems, related deaths, and birth defects among the progeny of thousands more. 
*The 1991 massacre of Iraqi [[Shia Muslims]] after the Shia uprising at the end of the [[Gulf war]], in which tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians in regions such as [[Basra]], [[Karbala]], [[Najaf]], [[Nasiriya]], [[Amarah|Amara]] and [[Al-Hillah]] were killed. Thousands of homes were demolished and vast areas of Iraq's marches were dried up causing devastating effect on the lives of people and the environment.
*Then, in March 1999, thousands more were believed to have been arrested, imprisoned and in some cases executed after a second uprising broke out after the killing of a prominent Shiite cleric.

* In May 2003, Amnesty International reported finding a grave containing 40 bodies at Abul Khasib in southern Iraq, which is almost exclusively Shia, thought to contain bodies from the 1991 Shia uprising.
*A massacre of Kurds in 1991, which targeted civilians and soldiers who fought for autonomy in northern [[Iraq]] after the [[Gulf war]], also resulted in mass graves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Facts on the Fact Sheet appear to have been those gathered by US Senate committee investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moreorless.au.com/killers/hussein.html Saddam Hussein killer file&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207020446/http://www.moreorless.au.com/killers/hussein.html |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* South of [[Baghdad]] a mass grave was uncovered which is thought to contain 60,000 Shia victims of the 1991 popular uprising which was brutally quelled by Saddam's Republican Guards.
* In 2003, just in the first a few days after Saddam's regime was toppled, 72 bodies were recovered who 
*The remains of 113 Kurds, most of whom were women, children and teenagers, have been uncovered near Samawah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/29/AR2005042901191.html | work=The Washington Post | title=113 Kurds Are Found In Mass Grave | first=Ellen | last=Knickmeyer | date=2005-04-30 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Discovery of mass grave sites in Iraq has been done through the analysis of satellite imagery.  This has 18 suspected sites, two of which are excavated having 28 and 10 adult males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/05/world/middleeast/05grave.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=f61682fbc3536b01&amp;ex=1307160000&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|title=Uncovering Iraq's Horrors in Desert Graves|work=[[The New York Times]] | first=John F. | last=Burns | date=2006-06-05 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*3,115 corpses uncovered in Mahaweel is one of the largest found believed to contain Iraqi Shia. (11/2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,102568,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Expert: 300,000 in Iraq's Mass Graves | date=2003-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2,000 corpses found in the Shia city of Hillah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/iraq/pdf/iraq_mass_graves.pdf Iraq's Legacy of Terror - Mass Graves&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213223644/http://www.usaid.gov/iraq/pdf/iraq_mass_graves.pdf |date=2007-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tony Blair has stated 'We've already discovered, just so far, the remains of 400,000 people in mass graves.' (11/03) The actual number of corpses found was closer to 5,000 (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12956,1263901,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=PM admits graves claim 'untrue' | first=Peter | last=Beaumont | date=2004-07-18 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2004, BBC reported finding Babies in mass graves dating to Saddam's era. "The skeletons of unborn babies and toddlers clutching toys are being unearthed, the investigators said."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3738368.stm | work=BBC News | title=Babies found in Iraqi mass grave | date=2004-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In April 2011, a mass grave was found containing 800 bodies in Anabr (West of Iraq), believed to be from the 1991 Shia uprising. Those bodies seemed to have been executed (point blank) and buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13094677 | work=BBC News | title=Iraq uncovers 'Saddam Hussein-era' grave of 800 bodies | date=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recovery of corpses is reported to be slow due to local violence and the need for identification of corpses, isolation of remains, forensics, etc.  Relatives have rushed to the graves in remembrance of missing relatives.

'''Mika Aaltonen''' (born 16 November 1965) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] former [[association football|footballer]]. His position was an attacking central midfielder. He also played for the [[Finland national football team|Finnish national team]].

During his career (1982–1994) he played in [[Finland]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], and [[Israel]] for [[Turun Palloseura|TPS]], [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]], [[AC Bellinzona|Bellinzona]], [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]], [[Hertha BSC]], [[Hapoel Be'er Sheva F.C.]] and [[Tampereen Pallo-Veikot]]. He finished his career at a relatively young age because of a persistent ankle injury, and because of this, he ended up concentrating more on his studies. Aaltonen studied throughout his playing career, and after he retired from football, he earned a doctorate degree in economics.

Aaltonen is best remembered for a superb goal scored against Italian goalkeeper [[Walter Zenga]] in [[UEFA Cup]] in 1987 during a match between [[Turun Palloseura]] and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] at the [[San Siro]] stadium in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/sport/4638-the-miracle-of-san-siro.pdf | title = Helsinki Times}}{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal more or less earned him a transfer to Inter shortly afterwards.

An ethnic [[Hungarians|Hungarian]], she was born and raised in [[Novi Sad]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. She became a naturalized [[American citizen]] in 1994 and also received Hungarian citizenship in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Grossly Abbreviated|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Columnists/Gross/2007/07/01/4305162-sun.html |work=[[Canadian Online Explorer]] |date=2007-07-01|accessdate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Titokban lett magyar állampolgár Szeles Mónika (Szeles Mónika has become a Hungarian citizen in secret) |work=[[Heti Világgazdaság]] |language=Hungarian |url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20070607_szeles_monika_allampolgar.aspx?s=24h |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|world no. 1]], she won nine [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles, eight of them as a teenager while representing Yugoslavia, and the final one while representing the United States.

In 1990, Seles became the youngest ever [[1990 French Open|French Open]] champion at the age of 16. She went on to win eight Grand Slam singles titles before her 20th birthday and was the year-end world no. 1 in 1991 and 1992. However, on April 30, 1993, she was the victim of an on-court attack, when a man stabbed her in the back with a {{convert|9|in|cm|adj=on}} long knife. Seles did not return to tennis for over two years.&lt;ref name="stabbed"/&gt; Though she enjoyed some success after rejoining the tour in 1995, including a fourth [[1996 Australian Open|Australian Open title in 1996]], she was unable to consistently reproduce her best form. She played her last professional match at the [[2003 French Open]], but did not officially retire until February 2008.

Regarded by many in the sport as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Seles was named one of the "30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref name=tm&gt;{{cite news|title=30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future – Monica Seles|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2079150_2079148_2079130,00.html|publisher=''TIME''|accessdate=August 19, 2011|author=William Lee Adams|date=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several players and historians have stated that Seles had the potential to become the most accomplished female player of all time had she not been stabbed.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jul/05/monica-seles-interview |title=Interview: Monica Seles |first=Tim |last=Adams |work=theguardian.com |date=2009-07-04 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=espnw&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2013/05/navratilova-seles-would-have-won-most-slams/47293/ |title=Navratilova: Seles would have won most Slams |first=Matt |last=Cronin |work=tennis.com |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=article&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2013/04/20-years-later-remembering-monica-seless-stabbing/47277/ |title=20 Years Later: Remembering Monica Seles' Stabbing |first=Jonathan |last=Scott |work=Tennis.com |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

==Early life and career==
Seles was born in Yugoslavia into an [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|ethnic Hungarian]] family. Her parents are Ester and Karolj&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/7354|title=Players|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she has an older brother, Zoltán. She began playing tennis at age five, coached by her father, a professional [[cartoonist]] employed for decades at the ''[[Dnevnik (Serbia)|Dnevnik]]'' and ''[[Magyar Szó]]'' newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2013/03/najbolja-jugoslovenska-teniserka-monika.html Najbolja jugoslovenska teniserka Monika Seleš (1.deo) – Naša Mala Mo!];''Studio'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; who drew pictures for her to make her tennis more fun. He is responsible for developing her two-handed style for both the forehand and backhand.&lt;ref&gt;Seles, Monica with Nancy Ann Richardson (1996) Monica From Fear to Victory&lt;/ref&gt; Later, her coach was [[Jelena Genčić]]. In 1985, at the age of 11, she won the [[Junior Orange Bowl]] tournament in [[Miami]], Florida, catching the attention of tennis coach [[Nick Bollettieri]]. In early 1986, Seles and her brother Zoltán moved from Yugoslavia to the United States, and Seles enrolled at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy, where she trained for two years and continued to practice until March 1990. Nine months after their arrival at the Academy, Seles' mother and father joined her and Zoltán in Florida.

Seles played her first professional tournament as an amateur in 1988 at age 14. The following year she turned professional on February 13, 1989, and joined the professional tour full-time, winning her first career title at [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] in May 1989, where she beat the soon-to-retire [[Chris Evert]] in the final. A month later, Seles reached the semifinals of her first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles tournament at the French Open, losing to then-world no. 1 Steffi Graf. Seles finished her first year on the tour ranked world no. 6.

==Tennis career==

===1990–92===
{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}&lt;!--only one citation in section--&gt;
After a slow start at the beginning of the season, Seles went on a 36-match winning streak and won 6 consecutive tournaments starting in Miami at the Lipton Player's Championships. During that winning streak she also won the U.S. Hard Court Championships (San Antonio, Texas), the Eckerd Open (Tampa, Florida), the Italian Open, and the Lufthansa Cup in Berlin, Germany (defeating Steffi Graf in the final in straight sets). Seles then won her first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles title at the [[1990 French Open]]. Facing world no. 1 Steffi Graf in the final, Seles saved four set points in a first-set tiebreaker, which she won 8–6, and went on to take the match in straight sets. In doing so, she became the youngest-ever French Open singles Champion at the age of 16 years, 6 months. Her winning streak was stopped by [[Zina Garrison]] at Wimbledon in the quarterfinals, where Seles had a match point before Garrison eventually won 9–7 in the 3rd set. Seles then won the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles title against Martina Navratilova and then defeated Navratilova again in winning the Oakland California tournament, in straight sets. She also won the 1990 year-end [[WTA Tour Championships|Virginia Slims Championships]], defeating [[Gabriela Sabatini]] in five sets (in the first five-set women's match since 1901 US National Championships), becoming the youngest to ever win the Season-Ending Championships. She finished the year ranked world no. 2.

1991 was the first of two years in which Seles dominated the women's tour. She started out by winning the Australian Open in January, beating [[Jana Novotná]] in the final. In March, she replaced Graf as the world no. 1. She then successfully defended her French Open title, beating the former youngest-ever winner, [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]], in the final. Unable to play at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], suffering from [[shin splints]], Seles took a six-week break. But she was back in time for the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], which she won by beating [[Martina Navratilova]] in the final, her third Grand Slam title of the year, to cement her position at the top of the world rankings. She also won the year-end Virginia Slims Championships for the second consecutive time, defeating Navratilova in four sets. At the end of season, Seles had won 10 out of the 16 tournaments she entered (reaching the final of every tournament that she entered that year). She ended the year as the no. 1 ranked player in the world.

1992 was an equally dominant year. Seles successfully defended her titles at the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. She also reached her first-ever final at Wimbledon, but lost to Graf. During Wimbledon, Seles encountered difficulty because of her habit of grunting or shrieking loudly when hitting shots. Her quarterfinal opponent [[Nathalie Tauziat]] was the first to complain to the chair umpire about it. During the third set of her semi-final match against [[Martina Navratilova]], Navratilova also complained to the chair umpire about the grunting after Seles went up a break at 4–2. Seles ended up losing the game and the break, but broke back and closed out the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-03/sports/sp-1393_1_monica-seles |title=WIMBLEDON : Seles Quiets Navratilov |first=Thomas |last=Bonk |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1992-07-03 |access-date=2018-04-28 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 1991 through February 1993, Seles won 22 titles and reached 33 finals out of the 34 tournaments she played. She compiled a 159–12 win-loss record (92.9% winning percentage), including a 55–1 win-loss record (98%) in Grand Slam tournaments. In the broader context of her first four years on the circuit (1989–1992), Seles had a win-loss record of 231–25 (90.2%) and collected 30 titles. She once again ended the year as the #1 ranked player in the world.

===1993 stabbing attack===
Seles was the top ranked women's player heading into 1993, having won the [[French Open]] for three consecutive years and both the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and [[Australian Open]] in consecutive years. In January 1993, Seles defeated Graf in the final of the Australian Open, which to date was her third win in four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] finals against Graf. She then won the Virginia Slims of Chicago over Martina Navratilova in three sets. This was the last title that Seles won before the attack in Hamburg, Germany.

On April 30 during a quarterfinal match with [[Magdalena Maleeva]] in [[WTA Hamburg|Hamburg]] in which Seles was leading, Günter Parche, an obsessed fan of Steffi Graf, ran from the middle of the crowd to the edge of the court during a break between games and stabbed Seles with a [[boning knife]] between her shoulder blades, to a depth of 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm (0.59&amp;nbsp;inches). She was quickly taken to a hospital. Although her physical injuries took only a few weeks to heal, she did not return to competitive tennis for more than two years. Initially, there was speculation that the attack might have been politically motivated because Seles was from Yugoslavia. She was known to have received death threats in relation to the [[Yugoslav Wars|ongoing conflict there]]. However, German authorities were quick to rule this out, describing her attacker as confused and possibly mentally disturbed.&lt;ref name=stabbed&gt;{{cite news|title=1993: Tennis star stabbed |work=On This Day 30&amp;nbsp;April 1993 |publisher=BBC |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/30/newsid_2499000/2499161.stm |date=1993-04-30 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parche was charged following the incident, but was not jailed because he was found to be psychologically abnormal, and was instead sentenced to two years' probation and psychological treatment. The incident prompted a significant increase in the level of security at tour events.&lt;ref name=stabbed /&gt; At that year's [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the players’ seats were positioned with their backs to the umpire's chair, rather than the spectators. Seles, however, disputed the effectiveness of these measures. She was quoted in 2011 as saying "From the time I was stabbed, I think the security hasn't changed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =O'Sullivan | first =John | title =Seles still has issues with security | work=The Irish Times | date =2011-04-09 | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2011/0409/1224294297903.html | accessdate =2011-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seles vowed never to play tennis in Germany again, disenchanted by the [[German legal system]]. "What people seem to be forgetting is that this man stabbed me intentionally and he did not serve any sort of punishment for it... I would not feel comfortable going back. I don't foresee that happening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Wood |title=WTA Under Fire from Seles |date=November 16, 2000 |publisher=BBC |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/1025898.stm |work=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later article, ''Tennis.com'' reported that Parche was living in nursing homes due to additional health problems.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

Graf visited Seles while she was hospitalized.&lt;ref name=articletwo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2013/05/navratilova-seles-would-have-won-most-slams/47293/ |title=Navratilova: Seles would have won most Slams |first=Matt |last=Cronin |work=Tennis.com |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Young Elders]], a band from Melbourne, Australia, sent their song called "Fly Monica Fly" to Seles while she was recuperating from the stabbing incident. She later said that the song provided inspiration to her at that time, and subsequently met the band (who later changed their name to the Monicas) following her victory at the Australian Open in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1996|title=Monica: From Fear to Victory| first1= Monica | last1= Seles| first2= Nancy Ann | last2= Richardson
| publisher= HarperCollins| edition= 1998| isbn= 9780006388005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stabbing incident is the subject of [[Dan Bern]]'s 1998 tribute to Seles, [[Fifty Eggs (album)|"Monica"]]. Additionally, American band [[Majesty Crush]] paid tribute with "Seles" from the 1993 album ''Love-15''.

The WTA suggested that Seles' [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|No. 1 ranking]] be preserved during her absence, but did not do so.&lt;ref name="newyork1995"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kOMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=8 July 2015 |publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=78|title=Comeback: Back stabbers |date=31 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Seles' autobiography, all active tour players opposed the idea except [[Gabriela Sabatini]], who abstained.&lt;ref name="it61008"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/seles-is-back-in-the-limelight-1.61008|title=Seles is back in the limelight|date=26 June 1996|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canchallena"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170730063335/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1630170-gaby-sabatiniahora-disfruto-de-todo-lo-que-no-hice-cuando-jugaba |archivedate= 30 July 2017|url=http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1630170-gaby-sabatiniahora-disfruto-de-todo-lo-que-no-hice-cuando-jugaba |language=Spanish |title=Gaby Sabatini.

===Comeback===
Seles returned to the tour in August 1995. In the runup to her comeback, then-WTA president [[Martina Navratilova]] proposed that Seles be reinstated alongside Steffi Graf as joint number one.&lt;ref name="newyork1995"/&gt; The WTA did so despite some opposition from players including [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]] and [[Gigi Fernández]], whose tournament placements would suffer greatly by suddenly being placed behind Seles.&lt;ref name="newyork1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wheel"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/24/sports/tennis-it-s-not-easy-being-the-third-wheel.html | title=NY Times: It's not easy being a third wheel | accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graf supported Seles' co-ranking, but not the additional proposal that Seles' co-ranking not be determined by the minimum participation of 12 tournaments a year required of everyone else. Graf felt that would give Seles an unfair advantage in the rankings.&lt;ref name="newyork1995"/&gt; Seles won her first comeback tournament, the [[1995 Canadian Open (tennis)|Canadian Open]], beating [[Amanda Coetzer]] in the final and setting a tournament record for the fewest number of games dropped by the champion throughout the tournament (14).

The following month at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Seles reached the final defeating world No.10 [[Anke Huber]], No. 4 Jana Novotná, and No. 3 Conchita Martínez (all in straight sets), but lost to Graf in the final.

In January 1996, Seles won her fourth Australian Open, beating Anke Huber in the final. Her pivotal match was the semifinal vs rising American star Chanda Rubin who led her 5–3 in the final set, and had 2 break points to lead 5–1. Seles came back from 2 points from defeat to triumph and reach the final. This was to be Seles' last [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] title, as she struggled to recapture her best form on a consistent basis. Seles was the runner-up at the US Open to Steffi Graf again in 1996. Seles' last Grand Slam final came at the French Open in 1998, just a few weeks after the death of her father and former coach, Karolj, from cancer. In the run to the final she had defeated world no. 3 [[Jana Novotná]] in three sets and world no. 1 [[Martina Hingis]] in straight sets, but lost to Sánchez Vicario in the three-set final.

While she did not reach another [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles final, she did consistently reach the quarterfinal and semifinal stages in those tournaments and was a fixture in the WTA Tour's top 10. In 2002, her last full year on the tour, she finished the year ranked world no. 7, defeated [[Venus Williams]], [[Martina Hingis]], [[Jennifer Capriati]], [[Justine Henin]], [[Maria Sharapova]], [[Kim Clijsters]], and [[Lindsay Davenport]], and reached at least the quarterfinals at each Grand Slam tournament.

Seles competed at the [[Tennis at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Women's Singles|1996 Olympic Games]] in Atlanta, where she beat Sabatini in a third round match before losing to Jana Novotná in the quarterfinals. Four years later, at the [[Tennis at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Women's Singles|2000 Olympic Games]] in Sydney, Seles captured her first Olympic medal, a bronze in singles. She defeated [[Jelena Dokic]] in the bronze medal match, after pushing eventual gold medalist Venus Williams to a tough 3 setter in the semis, losing 6–3 in the final set.

After becoming a U.S. citizen in 1994, Seles helped the U.S. team win the [[Fed Cup]] in 1996, 1999, and 2000.

===Hiatus and retirement===
[[File:Monica Seles.jpg|thumb|160px|Seles in the 2007 exhibition against [[Martina Navratilova]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]]]
In the spring of 2003, Seles sustained a foot injury. She was forced to withdraw during the second set of a match against [[Nadia Petrova]] at the [[Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]]. Then, a couple of weeks later and still injured, she lost in straight sets to the same player in the first round of the [[2003 French Open]]. It was the only time she ever lost a first-round match at a Grand Slam. She never again played an official tour match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/2/players/playerprofiles/PlayerActivity.asp?PlayerID=190141 Monica Seles playing activity] [[WTA Tour]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, Seles played two exhibition matches in New Zealand against Navratilova. Despite losing both matches, she played competitively and announced that she could return to the game early in 2006; however, she did not do so. She played three exhibition matches against Navratilova in 2007. On April 5, she defeated Navratilova in Houston, Texas, on [[clay court|clay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tennis.com/backcourt/general/backcourt.aspx?id=73172 Seles Sighting: Monica plays Martina in exhibition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209034256/http://www.tennis.com/backcourt/general/backcourt.aspx?id=73172 |date=February 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, Seles defeated Navratilova on an indoor court in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. On September 16, she beat her on clay in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenstennisblog.com/2007/09/17/monica-seles-defeats-martina-navratilova-in-exhibition-match-in-bucharest |title=Monica Seles defeats Martina Navratilova in exhibition match in Bucharest |publisher=Womenstennisblog.com |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, Seles told the press that [[Lindsay Davenport]]'s successful return to the tour had inspired her to consider her own limited comeback to play [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments and the major warm-up events for those tournaments. However, on February 14, 2008, Seles announced her official retirement from professional tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=2045 |title=Seles Announces Retirement From Professional Tennis |publisher=Sonyericssonwtatour.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Seles was elected to the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/sports/tennis/16tennis.html?_r=1 | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Seles Is Elected to Hall of Fame | first=Liz | last=Robbins | date=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
[[File:Seles outfit and racket.jpg|thumb|200px|Seles' outfit at the [[Tennis Hall of Fame]] Museum at the [[Newport Casino]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]]]]
Seles is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/top-10-womens-tennis-players-all-time-where-does-serena-williams-rank-list-greatest-2073830|title=Top 10 Women’s Tennis Players Of All-Time: Where Does Serena Williams Rank On List Of Greatest Ever?|publisher=International Business Times|author1=Jason Le Miere|date=28 August 2015|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/38769292|title=Serena Williams: Is she your greatest female player of the Open era?|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 January 2017|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/16371992/tennis-top-20-all|title=Tennis' Top 20 of All Time|publisher=ESPN|author1=Greg Garber|author2=Thomas Neumann|author3=Johnette Howard|date=23 June 2016|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Tennis Channel created a list of the [[100 Greatest of All Time|100 greatest]] tennis players. Seles was listed at #19.

Seles won eight Grand Slam titles during her teenage years. However, her career was greatly affected by the stabbing incident. Some involved with the sport have declared that Seles could have become the most accomplished female player. In an article written 20 years after Seles was stabbed, Jonathan Scott of ''Tennis.com'' stated, "Would Monica Seles have been the greatest female tennis player ever? The world will never know."&lt;ref name=article/&gt; In a 2013 interview, Martina Navratilova theorized that if Seles had not been stabbed, "We'd be talking about Monica with the most Grand Slam titles [ahead of] [[Margaret Court]] or Steffi Graf."&lt;ref name=espnw/&gt; Mary Joe Fernandez declared that Seles would have at least doubled her Grand Slam championship tally, had she not been attacked.&lt;ref name=espnw/&gt; Tim Adams of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that Seles would have become "the greatest female tennis player ever to pick up a racket."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

During the height of her career (the 1990 French Open through the 1993 Australian Open), she won eight of the 11 Grand Slam singles tournaments she contested. With eight Grand Slam singles titles before her 20th birthday, Seles holds the record for most Grand Slam singles titles won as a teenager in the Open Era.

Until her loss to [[Martina Hingis]] at the [[1999 Australian Open]], Seles had a perfect record at the event (33–0), which is the longest undefeated streak for this tournament (although Margaret Court won 38 consecutive matches there from 1960 to 1968 after losing a match in 1959). It also marked her first defeat in Australia, having won the [[Medibank International|Sydney tournament]] in 1996. Seles was the first female tennis player to win her first six [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles finals: [[1990 French Open]], [[1991 Australian Open]], [[1991 French Open]], [[1991 US Open (tennis)|1991 US Open]], [[1992 Australian Open]], and [[1992 French Open]]. Seles was also the first female player since [[Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling]] in 1937 to win the women's singles title three consecutive years at the French Open, a feat subsequently achieved by [[Justine Henin]] in 2005-7. (Also, [[Chris Evert]] won the title in four consecutive appearances in 1974, 1975, 1979, and 1980).

Shortly after her retirement, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Jon Wertheim]] summed up her later career:
{{quote|Yet, transformed from champion to tragedienne, Seles became far more popular than she was while winning all those titles. It became impossible to root against her. At first, out of sympathy. Then, because she revealed herself to be so thoroughly thoughtful, graceful, dignified. When she quietly announced her retirement last week at age 34, she exited as perhaps the most adored figure in the sport's history. As happy endings go, one could do worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/jon_wertheim/02/20/mailbag/index.html |title=Tennis Mailbag: Saluting Seles |first=Jon |last=Wertheim |work=SportsIllustrated.com |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] on July 11, 2009. In 2011, Seles was named one of the "30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref name=tm/&gt;

==Equipment and endorsements==
In the early 1990s, Seles signed a $4-million endorsement contract with [[Fila (company)|Fila]] to promote its footwear and tennis apparel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-26/business/fi-640_1_tennis-star |title=Athletic Firms Going to the Net in Quest for Next Tennis Celebrity |publisher=''The Los Angeles Times'' |date=June 26, 1990 |first=Bruce |last=Horovitz |accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She used a [[Prince original graphite]] racquet on court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/finding-the-spin/story-fnay3ubk-1226410204866?nk=ff5b5e1a7e3b23eca0390c14fd756c7e |title=Finding the spin may be a racquet |publisher=''The Australian'' |date=June 30, 2012 |first=Tom |last= Perrotta |accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August of the 1990 season, Seles switched to a Yonex racquet.

When she returned to the tour in 1995 after the stabbing sabbatical, Seles wore apparel by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and used a Yonex racquet on court.

In the 2000s, Seles wore apparel by Yonex and used [[Yonex]] SRQ Ti-800 Pro Long racquet on court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2000/08/20000828/No-Topic-Name/WHAT-THEYRE-WEARING-AND-HITTING-WITH-AT-THE-US-OPEN.aspx |title=WHAT THEY'RE WEARING (AND HITTING WITH) AT THE U.S. OPEN |publisher=SportsBusiness Journal |date=28 August 2000 |accessdate=10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On April 21, 2009, Seles released her [[memoir]] ''Getting A Grip: On My Body, My Mind, My Self'' which chronicles her bout with depression and [[binge eating disorder]] (BED) after her stabbing, her father's [[cancer]] diagnosis and eventual death, her journey back to the game and a life beyond tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103289593|title=Monica Seles On 'Getting A Grip' After Tragedy|newspaper=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seles is married to businessman [[Tom Golisano]],&lt;ref name= yacht&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/21404458/billionaire-thomas-golisano-husband-monica-seles-suing-yacht-renovations | agency= Associated Press| title= Former Sabres owner Thomas Golisano sues over yacht renovations| date= November 17, 2017 | location= Rochester, New York | website= ESPN.com| access-date= January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is 32 years her senior.

As of 2015, Seles is a paid spokesperson for Shire Pharmaceuticals, the makers of the first drug approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to treat BED, to raise awareness of the disorder she has suffered from since she was a young adult. Seles would eat normal amounts of food at meals, and then secretly eat large amounts of junk food when she was alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2015/03/08/monica-seles-gabriela-sabatini-exhibition-new-york/24609499/|title=Monica Seles sheds light on binge eating disorder|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|author=Casey, Tim|language=en| date=Mar 11, 2015|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In 1996, Seles made a guest appearance in the TV sitcom ''[[The Nanny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Nanny|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=opksAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pfwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5821,68672&amp;dq=monica+seles+the-nanny&amp;hl=en|accessdate=November 5, 2012|newspaper=Lakeland Ledger|date=March 11, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in 2008 in the TV series ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' as one of the contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet Dancing Stars Monica Seles and Cristian de la Fuente|url=http://www.tvguide.com/dancing-stars/meet-dancing-stars-10240.aspx|accessdate=November 5, 2012|newspaper=TV Guide|date=March 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Nasciturus pro iam nato habetur, quotiens de commodis eius agitur'''" is a [[Latin]] legal [[maxim (saying)|maxim]] that refers to a [[law]] that grants or protects the right of a [[fetus|foetus]] to [[inheritance|inherit]] [[property]]. The maxim translates to: "The unborn is deemed to have been born to the extent that his own benefits are concerned". "Nasciturus" literally translates to "one who is to be born" and refers to a [[Fertilisation|conceived]] foetus, i. e., a living child who has not yet been born. Pursuant to this legal principle, the foetus is presumed to have been born for the purposes of inheritance. The principle was reified in [[Roman law]] and continues to be implemented today in most [[Europe|European]] nations, in the [[Americas]] (where the foetus is sometimes legally considered to be a person), and in [[South Africa]].

When considered a legal exception, it is thought to apply exclusively for the purposes of inheritance and that conditions must be satisfied for it to be valid, primarily that the foetus has to be born.

==Historical instances of application==
Notable cases of the application of the maxim include [[John I of France|King John I of France]], the short-lived, posthumous son of [[Louis X of France|King Louis X]], who inherited the throne of [[France]] ''in utero'' and, upon birth, reigned for the 5 days of his post-natal life. Similarly, when [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] inherited the British throne, her proclamation of accession specified that she inherited it "saving the rights of any issue of his late Majesty [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]], which may be born of his late Majesty's consort" [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]], because any such unborn progeny would have had a prior claim to the throne; had there been such progeny born subsequent to the accession of Queen Victoria, he would have ''ipso facto'' displaced Victoria as British monarch.

'''The Offences Against the Person Act 1837''' (7 Will.4 &amp; 1 Vict. c.85) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. It reformed the law relating to [[offences against the person]].

It repealed a number of offences under the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1828]] and the corresponding Irish Act (10 Geo.4 c.34) and re-enacted them in different terms.

Section 4 replaced section 12 of the 1828 Act and abolished the death penalty for shooting, stabbing, cutting or wounding with intent. 

Section 6 replaced section 13 of the 1828 Act and abolished the death penalty for post-[[quickening]] abortions. Unlike the previous Act, this provision made no distinction between pre- and post- quickening abortions.

The Act has been wholly replaced by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].

'''Peter Graves''' (born '''Peter Duesler Aurness'''; March 18, 1926 – March 14, 2010) was an American film and television actor. He was best known for his role as [[Jim Phelps]] in the [[CBS]] television series ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' from 1967 to 1973 (original) and from 1988 to 1990 (revival). His elder brother was actor [[James Arness]] (1923–2011).  Graves was also known for his portrayal of airplane pilot Captain Clarence Oveur in the 1980 comedy film ''[[Airplane!]]'' and its 1982 sequel ''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]''.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Rolf Cirkler Aurness (1894–1982), a businessman, and his wife Ruth (née Duesler, died 1986), a [[journalist]]. Graves' ancestry was [[Norwegian Americans|Norwegian]], [[German Americans|German]], and [[English Americans|English]]. Peter used the stage name "Graves", a maternal family name,&lt;ref&gt;James Arness, James E. Wise Jr. (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dFnpSmZ-mNgC&amp;pg=PA10 "James Arness: an Autobiography"], {{ISBN|0-7864-1221-6}}, ''McFarland &amp; Company Inc.'', Accessed March 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; to honor his mother's family, and also so as to not be confused with his older brother, [[James Arness]], the star of the television series ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.

Graves graduated from [[Southwest High School (Minneapolis)|Southwest High School]] in 1944. He served in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]] reaching the rank of [[corporal]].&lt;ref name="service"/&gt; After demobilisation, Graves enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]] on the [[G.I. Bill]], and was a member of [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity.

==Career==
Graves appeared in more than 70 films, television shows, and television movies during his career. In 1955, Graves joined the [[NBC]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[Fury (TV series)|Fury]]'', as the [[ranch]]er and adoptive single father, Jim Newton.&lt;ref name="inbaseline1"&gt;[[InBaseline]] Database [http://www.inbaseline.com/person.aspx?person_id=4213901]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="americamovie1"&gt;[http://khatrimaza.hevcmovie.com/p/host-biographies.html AmericaMovie Biographies ''(Peter Graves)'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Graves also was featured in the 1953 World War II film, ''[[Stalag 17]]''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Turner Classic Movies]] (Peter Graves) [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/75447%7C123968/Peter-Graves/]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From 1960 to 1961, Graves starred as leading character Christopher Cobb in 34 episodes of the TV series ''[[Whiplash (TV series)|Whiplash]]''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In the storyline, Cobb is an American who arrives in [[Australia]] in the 1850s to establish the country's first stagecoach line, using a [[bullwhip]] rather than a gun to fight the crooks  he encounters.&lt;ref name="inbaseline1"/&gt; The series also starred Anthony Wickert. Graves also starred in the British ITC series ''[[Court Martial (TV series)|Court Martial]]'', playing U.S. Army lawyer Major Frank Whittaker (one of the series' two American leads starring opposite Bradford Dillman's Captain David Young), as well as guest roles in such series as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'',&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; ''[[Cimarron City (TV series)|Cimarron City]]'', ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', and ''[[The Invaders]]'',(episode "Moonshot").  In 1967, Graves was recruited by [[Desilu Studios]] to replace [[Steven Hill]] as the lead actor on ''[[Mission: Impossible]]''. Graves portrayed the iconic character of James Phelps, the sometimes-gruff director of the [[Impossible Missions Force]], for the six following seasons of the series.&lt;ref name="inbaseline1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americamovie1"/&gt; After the series ended in 1973, Graves played a cameo-type support role in the feature film ''Sidecar Racers'' in Australia which was released in 1975. Graves also made a guest appearance in the teen [[soap opera]] ''[[Class of 74]]'' in mid-1974, playing himself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Graves was cast as Palmer Kirby in the 1983 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[miniseries]], ''[[The Winds of War (TV miniseries)|The Winds of War]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Winds of War (TV miniseries)|The Winds of War]]'' at the Turner Classic Movie Database [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/484716/Winds-of-War-The/]&lt;/ref&gt; He played opposite [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Jan Michael Vincent]], [[Deborah Winters]] and [[Ali MacGraw]] in what became in 1983, the second-most watched miniseries of all time (after ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]])''.&lt;ref name="americamovie1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2010/09/28/top-15-miniseries-of-all-time/|title=Top 15 Miniseries of all Time|work=Listverse|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he became the host of [[PBS]]' ''[[Discover: The World of Science]]'', based on [[Discover Magazine]].

After playing mainly serious roles in the 1970s, he appeared as Captain Clarence Oveur in the early 1980s comedies ''Airplane!'' and ''Airplane II: The Sequel''.&lt;ref name="inbaseline1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americamovie1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/14/obit.peter.graves/index.html |title='Mission: Impossible' actor Peter Graves dead at 83 |date=15 March 2010 |work= [[CNN]] |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, a [[Hollywood]] writers' strike resulted in a [[Mission: Impossible (1988 TV series)|new ''Mission: Impossible'' series]] being commissioned. Graves was the only cast member from the original series to return as a regular, reprising his role as James Phelps, though others (most notably [[Greg Morris]], whose son [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil]] was a regular in this version) made guest appearances.&lt;ref name="inbaseline1"/&gt; The series was filmed in Australia, and Graves made his third journey there for acting work. The new version of ''Mission: Impossible'' lasted for two seasons, ending in 1990. Bookending his work on ''Mission: Impossible'', Graves starred in two [[television pilot|pilot films]] called ''Call to Danger'', which were an attempt to create a ''Mission: Impossible''–style series in which Graves played a government agent (the Bureau of National Resources) who recruited civilians with special talents for secret missions.&lt;ref name="inbaseline1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0453002|Call to Danger (1968) (TV)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0069835|Call to Danger (1973) (TV)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PeterGravesJoanEndressOct09.jpg|thumb|Graves with wife Joan Endress in October 2009]]

The 1960s version of the pilot, according to Patrick White in ''The Complete Mission: Impossible Dossier'' (which White reports was actually the second such pilot, but Graves was not involved in the first), is credited with winning Graves the role of Phelps; after ''Mission: Impossible'' ended in 1973, Graves filmed a third version of the pilot (this one structured as a [[Television film|made-for-TV movie]]), but it did not sell as a series. The concept was later used in the brief 1980s adventure series ''[[Masquerade (TV series)|Masquerade]]''.

During the 1990s, he hosted and narrated the documentary series ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' on [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]].&lt;ref name="inbaseline1"/&gt; He also acted in a number of films featured on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', which subsequently featured running jokes about Graves's ''Biography'' work and presumed sibling rivalry with Arness. The films that have been featured on ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' include ''[[SST: Death Flight]]'', ''[[It Conquered the World]]'', ''[[Beginning of the End (film)|Beginning of the End]]'', and ''[[Parts: The Clonus Horror]]''.  The film ''[[Killers from Space]]'' was featured in ''[[The Film Crew]]'', [[Michael J. Nelson|Michael J. Nelson's]] follow-up to ''[[MST3K]]''.&lt;ref name="inbaseline1"/&gt; Graves himself [[parody|parodied]] his ''Biography'' work in the film ''[[Men in Black II]]'', hosting an exposé television show. He also played Colonel John Camden on the television series ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''.

Graves refused to reprise the role of Jim Phelps (played by [[Jon Voight]]) in the [[Mission: Impossible (film)|1996 film]] update of ''Mission: Impossible'', after the character was revealed to be a traitor and the villain of the film. In the film, Phelps murders three fellow IMF agents, and is killed in a helicopter crash at the end, a decision that disappointed Graves and fellow cast members, and upset many fans of the original series.&lt;ref name="CNN obit" /&gt;

On October 30, 2009, Graves was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6667 Hollywood Blvd.&lt;ref name="CNN obit" /&gt;

[[AirTran Airways]] featured Graves in a series of web-only "Internetiquette" videos in 2009 in which Graves appeared in a pilot's uniform and references classic ''Airplane!'' lines.&lt;ref name=netiq&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000520042019/http://www.internetiquette.com/ "Internetiquette"] ''[[AirTran Airways]]''. Retrieved 2010-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The videos were part of an AirTran Airways campaign to promote their in-flight wireless Internet access.&lt;ref name=netiq/&gt;

In the summer of 2009, Graves signed on as a spokesman for [[reverse mortgage]] lender [[American Advisors Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aargreverse.com |title=aargreverse.com |publisher=aargreverse.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304083603/http://www.aargreverse.com/ |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves' final project was narrating the computer game epic ''[[Darkstar: The Interactive Movie]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famousdead.com/peter-graves/ |title=Peter Graves |publisher=FamousDEAD |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; released November 5, 2010.

'''Quantum immortality''' refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide regardless of the odds.&lt;ref name="mit_edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/quantum.html#immortality|title=Quantum immortality|last=Tegmark|first=Max|date=November 1998|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith Lynch recalls that [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]] took great delight in paradoxes such as the [[unexpected hanging paradox|unexpected hanging]]. Everett did not mention quantum suicide or quantum immortality in writing, but his work was intended as a solution to the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Lynch said "Everett firmly believed that his many-worlds theory guaranteed him immortality: his consciousness, he argued, is bound at each branching to follow whatever path does not lead to death";&lt;ref&gt;See Eugene Shikhovtsev's Biography of Everett: [http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/everett.html#e23 Keith Lynch remembers 1979–1980]&lt;/ref&gt; Tegmark explains, however, that life and death situations do not normally hinge upon a sequence of binary quantum events like those in the thought experiment.&lt;ref name="mit_edu"/&gt;

==Thought experiment==
The quantum suicide thought experiment involves the same apparatus as [[Schrödinger's cat]] – a box which kills the occupant in a given time frame with probability one half due to [[quantum uncertainty]].&lt;ref&gt;The simplest example of this is a weapon triggered by a [[two level system]]. Schrödinger described his as a radioactive decay detector while Moravec's was a device measuring the [[spin (physics)|spin value]] of protons.&lt;/ref&gt; The only difference is to have the experimenter recording observations be the one inside the box. The significance of this is that someone whose life or death depends on a [[qubit]] can distinguish between [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]. By definition, fixed observers cannot.

At the start of the first iteration, under both interpretations, the probability of surviving the experiment is 50%, as given by the squared norm of the [[wave function]]. At the start of the second iteration, assuming the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is true, the [[Wave function collapse|wave function has already collapsed]]; thus, since the experimenter is already dead, there is a 0% chance of survival for any further iterations. However, if the [[many-worlds interpretation]] is true, a superposition of the live experimenter ''necessarily'' exists (as also does the one who dies). Now, barring the possibility of [[afterlife|life after death]], after every iteration only one of the two experimenter superpositions – the live one – is capable of having any sort of conscious experience. Putting aside the philosophical problems associated with [[Identity (philosophy)|individual identity and its persistence]], we may assert that, under the many-worlds interpretation, the experimenter, or at least a version of them, continues to exist through all of their superpositions where the outcome of the experiment is that they live. In other words, we may say that a version of the experimenter survives all iterations of the experiment, whichever its number. Since the superpositions where the experimenter lives occur by quantum necessity (again, under the many-worlds interpretation), it follows that their survival, after any realizable number of iterations, is physically necessary; hence, the notion of quantum ''immortality''.

A version of the experimenter surviving stands in stark contrast to the implications of the Copenhagen interpretation, according to which, although the survival outcome is possible in every iteration, its probability tends towards zero as the number of iterations increases. Due to the many-worlds interpretation, the above scenario has the opposite property: the probability of a version of the experimenter living is necessarily one for any number of iterations.

==Real-world feasibility==
In response to questions about "subjective immortality", [[Max Tegmark]] made some brief comments: He acknowledged the argument that "everyone will be immortal" may follow if a survivor outcome is possible for all life-threatening events. The flaw in that argument, he suggests, is that dying is rarely a binary event; it is a progressive process. The quantum suicide thought experiment attempts to isolate all possible outcomes for the duration of the thought experiment. That isolation delays [[decoherence]] in such a way that the subjective experience of the superposition is illustrated. It is only within the confines of such an abstract quantum scenario that an observer finds they defy all odds.

Physicist [[David Deutsch]], though a proponent of the MWI, states regarding quantum suicide that "that way of applying probabilities does not follow directly from quantum theory, as the usual one does. It requires an additional assumption, namely that when making decisions one should ignore the histories in which the decision-maker is absent....[M]y guess is that the assumption is false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutsch |first=David |year=2011 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |publisher=Penguin Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tegmark also believes experimenters will only expect a normal probability of survival, not immortality. The experimenter's [[probability amplitude]] in the wavefunction decreases significantly, meaning they exist with a much lower measure than they had before. Per the [[anthropic principle]], a person is less likely to find themselves in a world where they are less likely to exist, that is, a world with a lower measure has a lower probability of being observed. Therefore, the experimenter will have a lower probability of observing a world in which they survive than the world in which they set up the experiment.&lt;ref name="Tegmark2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tegmark |first=Max |year=2014 |title=Our Mathematical Universe |publisher=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same problem of reduced measure was pointed out by [[Lev Vaidman]] in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/ Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Redress''', or '''The Redress Trust''' is a human rights organisation based in [[London]], England, that helps survivors of [[torture]] to obtain justice and reparation, in the form of compensation, rehabilitation, official acknowledgement of the wrong and formal apologies. In addition Redress seek accountability for those who have been tortured.

==Services==
Redress provides legal and related support in obtaining legal reparations, promote survivors' rights in international and regional courts and tribunals and promotes survivors’ rights in national policy and practice contexts in the [[United Kingdom]].

In 2008 Redress was addressing torture and related crimes in more than 50 countries in all regions or the world and having over 50 active case files relating to more than 957 survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redress.org/downloads/annual-reports/AR%202011%20for%20the%20web.pdf|title=2011 Annual Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Redress was founded in 1992 by Keith Carmichael, a British torture survivor who sought justice for how he had been treated while a prisoner in [[Saudi Arabia]] from November 1981 until March 1984. After his release, Carmichael found that while the existing [[non-governmental organization]]s advocated for the release of prisoners, provided medical attention, and operated safe havens, none existed to seek [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] under international law. Redress was founded to fill that gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redress.org/about/who-we-are|title=About REDRESS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
* To provide direct support to torture survivors to obtain justice and redress.

'''Roadkill''' refers to an [[Fauna|animal or animals]] that have been struck and killed by [[motor vehicle]]s on [[highway]]s. It is important because of the animal suffering, loss of wild animals, [[Road traffic safety|road safety]], and the economic impact on both drivers and road management. For this reason it has increasingly become the topic of academic research to understand the causes, and how it can be mitigated. Some roadkill can also [[Roadkill cuisine|be eaten]].

==History==
During the early 20th century, roadkill or "flat meats" (or "highway pizza") became a common sight in most industrialized [[First World]] nations, as they adopted the internal combustion engine and the [[automobile]]. One of the earliest observers of roadkill was the naturalist Joseph Grinnell, who noted in 1920: "This [roadkill] is a relatively new source of fatality; and if one were to estimate the entire mileage of such roads in the state [California], the mortality must mount into the hundreds and perhaps thousands every 24 hours." &lt;ref&gt;Field notes of Joseph Grinnell from the Archives of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, http://bsit.berkeley.edu/mvz/vol{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} umes.html; 1920–21: Section 2: Journal and catalog: Death Valley, Calif., May 5, 1920, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]] and [[North America]], [[deer]] are the animal most likely to cause vehicle damage. In [[Australia]], specific actions taken to protect against the variety of animals that can damage vehicles – such as [[bullbar]]s (usually known in Australia as 'roo bars', in reference to [[kangaroo]]s) – indicate the Australian experience has some unique features with road kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2005/s1516291.htm |title=Report shows high animal road kill toll in Tasmania |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2005-11-24 |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Causes==
The development of roads affects wildlife by altering and isolating habitat and populations, deterring the movement of wildlife, and resulting in extensive wildlife mortality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://longpointcauseway.com/library/Road%20Mortality%20on%20the%20Long%20Point%20Causeway.pdf "Road Mortality of Amphibians, Reptiles and Other Wildlife on the Long Point Causeway, Lake Erie, Ontario"], E. Paul Ashley ''et al''., 1996, ''Canadian Field Naturalist'', 110, p. 403-412, at p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; One writer states that "our insulated industrialized culture keeps us disconnected from life beyond our windshields."&lt;ref name="Psychology Today Animals and Cars"/&gt; Driving "mindlessly" without paying attention to the movements of others in the vehicle's path, driving at speeds that do not allow stopping, and distractions contribute to the death toll.&lt;ref name="Psychology Today Animals and Cars"/&gt; Moreover, a culture of indifference and hopelessness is created if people learn to ignore lifeless bodies on roads.&lt;ref name="Psychology Today Animals and Cars"/&gt;

===Intentional collisions===
A study in [[Ontario]], Canada in 1996 found many [[reptile]] killed on portions of the road where vehicle tires do not usually pass over, which led to the inference that some drivers intentionally run over reptiles.&lt;ref name="Ashley 2007"/&gt;{{rp|138}} To verify this hypothesis, research in 2007 found that 2.7% of drivers intentionally hit reptile decoys masquerading as snakes and turtles.&lt;ref name="Ashley 2007"/&gt; "Indeed, several drivers were observed speeding up and positioning their vehicles to hit the reptiles".&lt;ref name="Ashley 2007"/&gt;{{rp|142}} Male drivers hit the reptile decoys more often than female drivers.&lt;ref name="Ashley 2007"/&gt;{{rp|140–141}} On a more compassionate note, 3.4% of male drivers and 3% of female drivers stopped to rescue the reptile decoys.&lt;ref name="Ashley 2007"/&gt;{{rp|140}}

===Road salt accumulations===
{{main article|Rumble strip#Wildlife attraction}}
On roadways where [[rumble strip]]s are installed to provide a tactile vibration alerting drivers when drifting from their lane, the rumble strips may accumulate [[road salt]] in regions where it is used. The excess salt can accumulate and attract both small and large wildlife in search of [[salt lick]]s; these animals are at great risk of becoming roadkill or causing accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdt.mt.gov/research/docs/research_proj/wildlife_crossing_mitigation/final_report.pdf |title=Wildlife-Vehicle Collision and Crossing Mitigation Measures: A Toolbox for the Montana Dept of Transportation, May 2007 |publisher=Mdt.mt.gov |date=2013-04-19 |accessdate=2013-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102053955/http://mdt.mt.gov/research/docs/research_proj/wildlife_crossing_mitigation/final_report.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/articles/2941.html |title=Reducing Moose–Vehicle Collisions through Salt Pool Removal and Displacement: an Agent-Based Modeling Approach, Ecology and Society, 2009 |publisher=Ecologyandsociety.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfhrc.gov/pubrds/05sep/05.htm |title=U.S. FHWA, Public Roads, Of Moose and Mud, Sept/Oct 2005 |publisher=Tfhrc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and abundance==

Very large numbers of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates are killed on the world's roads every day.&lt;ref&gt;Case, R.M. (1978) ''Interstate highway road-kill animals: a data source for biologists'', Wildlife Society Bulletin '''6:''' 8-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of animals killed in the United States has been estimated at a million per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mapping Traffic’s Toll on Wildlife |last=Wollan |first=Malia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/technology/13roadkill.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105150234/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/technology/13roadkill.html |deadurl=no |archivedate=5 November 2011 |date=12 September 2010 |accessdate=14 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Andreas |last1=Seiler |first2=J-O |last2=Helldin |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davenport |editor2-first=Julia L. |editor2-last=Davenport |work=The Ecology of Transportation: Managing Mobility for the Environment |title=Mortality In Wildlife Due To Transportation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9o7rq6WnSXEC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=roadkill+estimate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E_AHe7VxjC&amp;sig=QtiOJC78xJcWAlfi_l2XYBi4mOI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c80LUvmKHuKY2AXH94CICA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=roadkill%20estimate&amp;f=false|isbn=1-4020-4503-4|accessdate=14 August 2013 |year=2006 |publisher=Springer |pages=166–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 350,000 to 27 million [[birds]] are estimated to be killed on European roads each year.&lt;ref&gt;Erritzoe J., Mazgajski T. D., Rejt Ł. 2003 ''Bird casualties on European roads – a review'' Acta Ornithol. '''38:''' 77–93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species affected==
Mortality resulting from roadkill can be very significant for species with small populations. Roadkill is estimated to be responsible for 50% of deaths of [[Florida panther]]s, and is the largest cause of [[European badger|badger]] deaths in England. Roadkill is considered to significantly contribute to the population decline of many threatened species, including [[wolf]], [[koala]] and [[eastern quoll]].&lt;ref name="CSIRO 2008"&gt;Alistair J. Hobday and Melinda L. Minstrell: [http://www.publish.csiro.au/view/journals/dsp_journal_fulltext.cfm?nid=144&amp;f=WR08067 ''Distribution and abundance of roadkill on Tasmanian highways: human management options''], in Wildlife Research, '''35''' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In Tasmania, Australia the most common species affected by roadkill are [[brushtail possum]]s and [[Tasmanian pademelon]]s.&lt;ref name="CSIRO 2008"/&gt;

[[File:FlatSquirrel.jpg|thumb|A roadkill squirrel near a driveway]]
In 1993, 25 schools throughout [[New England]], United States participated in a roadkill study involving 1,923 animal deaths. By category, the fatalities were: 81% [[mammal]]s, 15% [[bird]], 3% [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s, 1% indiscernible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roadkill.edutel.com/rkdataarchive.html |title=Roadkill 2007 – Summary of Past Data |publisher=Roadkill.edutel.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[extrapolation|Extrapolating]] these data nationwide, Merritt Clifton (editor of ''Animal People Newspaper'') estimated that the following animals are being killed by motor vehicles in the United States annually: 41 million [[squirrel]]s, 26 million [[Domestic cat|cats]], 22 million [[rat]]s, 19 million [[Virginia opossum|opossums]], 15 million [[raccoon]]s, 6 million [[dog]]s, and 350,000 [[deer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/ |title=Animal People Newspaper |publisher=Animalpeoplenews.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study may not have considered differences in observability between taxa (e.g. dead raccoons are easier to see than dead frogs), and has not been published in peer-reviewed scientific literature.

===Insects===
A recent study showed that insects, too, are prone to a very high risk of roadkill incidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rao |first1=R. Shyama Prasad |last2=Girish |first2=M. K. Saptha |year=2007 |title=Road kills: Assessing insect casualties using flagship taxon |journal=Current Science |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=830–837 |publisher=Current Science Association |url=http://www.lauxen.net/conecte/referencias/Rao_2007a.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research showed interesting patterns in insect roadkills in relation to the vehicle density.

In 2003-2004, the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] investigated anecdotal reports of declining insect populations in the UK by asking drivers to affix a postcard-sized PVC rectangle, called a "splatometer", to the front of their cars.&lt;ref name=Splatometer2003&gt;{{cite news|title='Splatometer' to count bug life|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3032476.stm|accessdate=4 June 2014|agency=BBC News|date=30 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 40,000 drivers took part, and the results found one squashed insect for every {{convert|5|mi}} driven. This contrasts with 30 years ago when cars were covered more completely with insects, supporting the idea that insect numbers had waned.&lt;ref name=McCarthy2004&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCarthy |first1=Michael |title=40,000 'splatometers' can't be wrong: insect population is in decline |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/40000-splatometers-cant-be-wrong-insect-population-is-in-decline-6162502.html |accessdate=4 June 2014 |agency=The Independent |date=2 Sep 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606214604/http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/40000-splatometers-cant-be-wrong-insect-population-is-in-decline-6162502.html |archivedate=June 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Dutch biologist Arnold van Vliet coordinated a similar study of insect deaths on car license plates. He found two insects killed on the license-plate area for every {{convert|10|km}} driven. This implies about 1.6 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] insect deaths by cars per year in the [[Netherlands]], and about 32.5 trillion deaths in the United States if the figures are extrapolated there.&lt;ref name=Messenger2011&gt;{{cite news |last1=Messenger|first1=Stephen|title=Trillions of Insects Killed by Cars Every Year, Says Study |url=http://www.treehugger.com/cars/trillions-of-insects-killed-by-cars-every-year-says-study.html |accessdate=22 June 2014 |agency=TreeHugger |date=10 Jul 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scavengers===
One rarely considered positive aspect of roadkill is the regular availability of [[carrion]] it provides for [[scavenger]] species such as [[vultures]], [[crows]], [[foxes]], [[Virginia opossum]]s and a wide variety of carnivorous insects. Areas with robust scavenger populations tend to see roadkilled animal corpses being quickly carried off, sometimes within minutes of being struck. This can skew data and cause a lower estimation of the number of roadkill animals per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/1524248723 search.proquest.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In particularly roadkill-prone areas, some scavenging birds can rely on roadkill for much of their daily nutritional requirements, and can often be seen observing the roadway from [[telephone poles]] and trees, waiting for small animals to be struck so they can swoop down and feed. However, such scavengers are at greater risk of becoming roadkill themselves, and are subject to [[evolutionary pressure]] to be alert to traffic hazards.

In contrast, areas where scavengers have been driven out (such as many urban areas) often see roadkill rotting in place indefinitely on the roadways and being further macerated by [[traffic]]. The remains must be manually removed by dedicated disposal personnel and disposed of via [[Cremation|sanitary cremation]]; this greatly increases the public nuisance inherent to roadkill, unnecessarily complicates its disposal, and consumes additional public money, time and fuel that could be spent on other roadway maintenance projects.

==Research==
===Roadkill observation projects===
The study of roadkill has proven highly amenable to the application of [[citizen science]] observation methods. Since 2009, statewide roadkill observation systems have been started in the US, enrolling hundreds of observers in reporting roadkill on a website. The observers, who are usually naturalists or professional scientists, provide identification, location, and other information about the observations. The data are then displayed on a website for easy visualization and made available for studies of proximate causes of roadkill, actual wildlife distributions, wildlife movement, and other studies. Roadkill observation system websites are available for the US states of California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/california |title=wildlifecrossing.net/california |publisher=Wildlifecrossing.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/maine |title=wildlifecrossing.net/maine |publisher=Wildlifecrossing.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fishandgame.idaho.gov/roadkill/ |title=Roadkill — Wildlife Collision Mortalities &amp;#124; IFWIS |publisher=Fishandgame.idaho.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, index roads are used to help quantify total impact of vehicle collisions on specific vertebrate taxa.

In the United Kingdom, ‘Project Splatter’ was started by [[Cardiff University]] in 2012, with the aim of estimating the impact of roads and motoring on British wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projectsplatter.co.uk/ ‘Project Splatter’ roadkill observation project] in the United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has gathered data on its website, and on several social media platforms including [[Facebook]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/SplatterProject13?fref=ts ‘Project Splatter’ page on Facebook]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/projectsplatter ‘Project Splatter’ page on Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt;

In India,(PATH) 'Provide Animals safe Transit on Highways' was initiated by [[Environment Conservation Group]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecgwild.org/|title=Environment Conservation Group (ECG) -|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015, to study the impact of roads on Indian wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecgwild.org/path ‘PATH’ roadkill observation project] in the India&lt;/ref&gt; A team of five wildlife conservationists led by Mr. R. Mohammed Saleem, had undertaken a forty-four-day expedition, traveling more than 17,000 kilometers across 22 states to study and spread awareness on roadkill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-animals-cross-the-road/article8414931.ece|title=When animals cross the road…|first=K.|last=Jeshi|date=31 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016|via=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/stop-the-animals-are-crossing/article8029760.ece|title=Stop!

===State wildlife roadkill identification guide===
&lt;!--what, no mention of "Flattened Fauna" (rev. ed. 2006)?--&gt;
The first wildlife roadkill identification guide produced by a state agency in North America was published by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation (BCMoT) in Canada in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/Publications/eng_publications/environment/WRIG/ |title=th.gov.bc.ca |publisher=th.gov.bc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; BCMoT’s "Wildlife Roadkill Identification Guide" focused on the most common large carnivores and ungulates found in British Columbia. The guide was developed to assist BCMoT's maintenance contractors in identifying wildlife carcasses found on provincial highways as part of their responsibilities for BCMoT’s Wildlife Accident Reporting System (WARS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/Publications/eng_publications/environment/WARS_reports.htm |title=th.gov.bc.ca |publisher=th.gov.bc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
{{anchor|Prevention}}
[[File:Goat underpass.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mountain goat]]s used to cross [[US Route 2]] to reach a [[salt lick]] on the other side of the canyon. Now they can get there via rocky passageways underneath these bridges, shielded from view by tree cover and the steep hillside.]]
[[File:Australia animal warning sign.jpg|thumb|[[Traffic signs]] are often used to warn of areas with increased animal activity. These signs are not always successful, as shown by the dead [[emu]] in the far distance to the right of the sign.]]

Collisions with animals can have many negative consequences:
*Death and suffering of animals struck by vehicles
*Injury to, or death of, vehicle occupants
*Loss of valuable [[livestock]] or [[pet]]s
*Harm to [[endangered species]]
*Vehicle damage
*Economic losses (cleanup, repairs to vehicles, etc.)
*Roadkill is a distasteful sight, particularly costly to locations economically reliant on [[tourism]]&lt;ref name="CSIRO 2008"/&gt;

Regardless of the spatial scale at which the mitigation measure is applied, there are two main types of roadkill mitigation measures: changing driver behavior, and changing wildlife behavior.&lt;ref name="Magnus, Z. 2004"&gt;Magnus, Z., L.K. Kriwoken, N.J. Mooney, and M. E. Jones. 2004. Reducing the incidence of wildlife roadkill: improving the visitor experience in Tasmania&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three potential ways to change driver behavior. Primary methods focus on changing driver attitude by increasing public awareness and helping people understand that reducing roadkill will benefit their community. The second potential way is to make people aware of specific hazardous areas by use of signage, [[rumble strip]]s or lighting. The third potential way is to slow traffic physically or psychologically, using [[chicane]]s or [[speed bump]]s.

There are three categories of altering wildlife behavior. Primary methods discourage wildlife from loitering on roadsides by reducing food and water resources, or by making the road surfaces lighter in color which may make wildlife feel more exposed on the roadway. Second are methods of discouraging wildlife from crossing roads, at least when cars are present, using equipment such as ultrasonic whistles, reflectors, and fencing. Third are mechanisms to provide safe crossing like [[overpass]], [[underpass]]es and escape routes.

===Large animals===
[[File:Moosecrossingkenaiak.JPG|thumb|Moose crossing sign with kill counter, [[Kenai, Alaska]]. Trees and brush near the road are trimmed back to make approaching moose easier to see.]]
In the US, an estimated 1.25 million insurance claims are filed annually due to collisions with [[deer]], [[elk]], or [[moose]], amounting to 1 out of 169 collision damage claims.&lt;ref name="SFarm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch Out For Animals In The Road|url=https://learningcenter.statefarm.com/safety-2/auto-2/watch-out-for-animals-in-the-road/|website=State Farm|accessdate=2016-02-28|date=Sep 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collisions with large animals with antlers (such as deer) are particularly dangerous, as the animal's head has a tendency to separate and come through the [[windshield]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} but any large, long-legged animal (e.g. horses, larger cattle, camels) can pose a similar cabin incursion hazard.&lt;ref name="Tchir" /&gt; Injury to humans due to driver failure to maintain control of a vehicle either while avoiding, or during and immediately after an animal impact, is also common. Dusk and dawn are times of highest collision risk.&lt;ref name="Chan"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chan |first1=Emily |title=Wait – don't swerve!

The recommended reaction to a large animal (such as a moose) is to slow down in lane, if at all possible, and to avoid swerving suddenly, which could cause loss of control.&lt;ref name="SFarm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chan" /&gt; If a collision cannot be avoided, it is best to swerve towards the rear end of the animal, as it is more likely to run forward.&lt;ref name="SDT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animals on the Road |url=http://www.sdt.com.au/safedrive-directory-ANIMALSONTHEROAD.htm|website=Safe Drive Directory|publisher=Safe Drive Training |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drivers who see a deer near or in the roadway should be aware that it is very likely that other members of a herd are nearby.&lt;ref name="DrvEd"&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Minimize the Chances of Hitting Animals |url=https://driversed.com/driving-information/sharing-the-road-with-others/how-to-minimize-the-chances-of-hitting-animals.aspx|website=DriversEd.com|accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acoustic warning [[deer horn]]s can be mounted on vehicles to warn deer of approaching automobiles, though their effectiveness is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Janice. [http://advance.uconn.edu/2002/021118/02111812.htm "Deer-Whistles Ineffective, Says Bioacoustics Researcher."] November 2002. 21 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Ultrasonic wind-driven whistles are often promoted as a cheap, simple way to reduce the chance of '''wildlife-vehicle collisions'''. In one study, the sound pressure level of the whistle was 3&amp;nbsp;dB above the sound pressure level of the test vehicle, but caused no observable difference in behavior of animals when the whistles were activated and not activated, casting doubt on their effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Magnus, Z. 2004"/&gt;

===Small animals===
In regions where [[tree squirrel|squirrels]], [[rabbit]]s, [[bird]]s, or other small animals are plentiful, a tire-flattened one is a common sight on roadways. Motorists have caused serious accidents by trying to swerve or stop to avoid a squirrel in the road.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Edward|title=Squirrel blamed for accident: Couple struck head-on after woman swerves to avoid animal |url=http://www.journal-news.net/page/content.detail/id/505127/Squirrel-blamed-for-accident.html |accessdate=6 May 2012 |newspaper=[[The Journal (West Virginia newspaper)|The Journal]] (Martinsburg, WV)|date=March 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102003457/http://www.journal-news.net/page/content.detail/id/505127/Squirrel-blamed-for-accident.html |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CST&gt;{{cite news|title=Driver says squirrels made him crash into garage |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/8018878-418/driver-says-squirrels-made-him-crash-into-garage.html |accessdate=19 April 2012 |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=October 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106204400/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/8018878-418/driver-says-squirrels-made-him-crash-into-garage.html |archivedate=January 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whidbey&gt;{{cite web|title=Confused squirrel causes three-car accident|url=http://www.southwhidbeyrecord.com/news/21576764.html|work=South Whidbey Record|publisher=Sound Publishing Inc. |accessdate=19 April 2012|date=25 Jun 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101235927/http://www.southwhidbeyrecord.com/news/21576764.html |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NatPost"&gt;{{cite news |title=Vancouver island driver who hit the brakes for squirrel causes huge four-vehicle crash |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/vancouver-island-driver-who-hit-the-brakes-for-squirrel-on-causes-huge-four-vehicle-crash |accessdate=2016-02-28|work=National Post|publisher=Postmedia Network Inc. |date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such evasive maneuvers are pointless, since small rodents and birds are much more agile and have much quicker [[reaction time]]s than motorists in heavy vehicles. There is very little a driver can do to avoid an unpredictably darting squirrel or rabbit, or even to intentionally hit one. The suggested course of action is to continue driving in a predictable, safe manner, and let the small animal decide on the spur of the moment which way to run or fly; the majority of vehicular encounters end with no harm to either party.&lt;ref name="Tchir"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tchir |first1=Jason |title=What should you do if you see an animal on the road?|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/what-should-you-do-if-you-see-an-animal-on-the-road/article19494060/ |accessdate=2016-02-28|work=The Globe and Mail|publisher=The Globe and Mail Inc. |date=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NoSwerve&gt;{{cite news|title=Swerving can be worse than hitting animal on road|url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/parenting-family/pets/story/2012-01-11/Swerving-can-be-worse-than-hitting-animal-on-road/52495428/1 |accessdate=6 May 2012|newspaper=USA Today |date=11 Jan 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504083202/http://yourlife.usatoday.com/parenting-family/pets/story/2012-01-11/Swerving-can-be-worse-than-hitting-animal-on-road/52495428/1 |archivedate=4 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OntHbk" /&gt;

===Night driving===
Although strikes can happen at any time of day, deer tend to move at dawn and dusk, and are particularly active during the October–December [[Estrous cycle|mating season]], and also during late March and early April, in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name="DrvEd" /&gt; Driving at night presents its own challenges: [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] species are active, and visibility, particularly side visibility, is reduced. [[Penguin]]s, for example, are common roadkill '''traffic victims''' in [[Wellington, New Zealand]], due to their skin color and the fact that they come ashore at dusk and leave again around dawn, making it hard for drivers to see them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blog.forestandbird.org.nz/the-demise-of-juan-carlos-and-his-feathered-friends/ |title=Roadkill in Wellington |date=13 September 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Night time drivers should reduce speed and use high beam headlights when possible, to give themselves maximum time to avoid a collision.&lt;ref name="DrvEd" /&gt; However, when headlights approach a nocturnal animal, it is hard for the creature to see the approaching car (nocturnal animals see better in low than in bright light). Furthermore, the glare of oncoming vehicle headlights can dazzle some species, such as rabbits; they will freeze in the road rather than flee. It may be better to flash the headlights on and off, rather than leaving them on continuously while approaching an animal.&lt;ref name="SFarm" /&gt;

The simple tactics of reducing speed and scanning both sides of the road for foraging deer can improve driver safety at night, and drivers may see the [[Tapetum lucidum|retro-reflection]] of an animal’s eyes before seeing the animal itself.&lt;ref name="Chan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DefDrv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OntHbk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animals on the road |url=http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/driver/handbook/section2.10.7.shtml |website=Ontario Ministry of Transportation: Driver's Handbook |publisher=Government of Ontario |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wildlife crossings===
[[Wildlife crossing]]s allow animals to travel over or underneath roads. They are most widely used in Europe, but have also been installed in a few US locations and in parts of [[Western Canada]]. As new highways cause habitats to become increasingly fragmented, these crossings could play an important role in protecting endangered species.

In the US, sections of road known to have heavy deer cross-traffic will usually have a warning sign depicting a bounding deer; similar signs exist for moose, elk, and other species. In the [[Western United States|American West]], roads may pass through large areas designated as "[[open range]]", meaning no fences separate drivers from large animals such as [[cattle]] or [[American bison|bison]]. A driver may round a bend to find a small herd standing in the road. Open range areas are generally marked with signage and protected by a [[Cattle grid|cattle guard]].

In an attempt to mitigate US$1.2 [[billion]] in animal-related vehicular damage, a few US states now have sophisticated systems to protect motorists from large animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregon.gov/odot/td/tp_res/docs/reports/animalvehicle.pdf |title="Animal Vehicle Crash Mitigation," Oregon Department of Transportation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these systems is called the '''Roadway Animal Detection System''' (RADS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cotrip.org/its/ITS%20Guidelines%20Web%20New%20Format%201-05/Web%20Solutions%20Packages/ITS%20Solution%20Packages%20-%20Web%20Copy/Animal%20Detection%20RAD-00-042-BRC%20Rev%203.pdf |title=Roadway Animal Detection System, Sensor Technologies &amp; Systems, Inc. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031040542/http://www.cotrip.org/its/ITS%20Guidelines%20Web%20New%20Format%201-05/Web%20Solutions%20Packages/ITS%20Solution%20Packages%20-%20Web%20Copy/Animal%20Detection%20RAD-00-042-BRC%20Rev%203.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeguards.com/product_info/ADS.pdf |title=Animal Detection System, Safeguards Technology, LLC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Solar energy|solar powered]] sensor can detect large animals such as deer, bear, elk, and moose near the roadway, and thereafter flash a light to alert oncoming drivers. The sensor's detection distance ranges from 650 feet to unlimited, depending on the terrain.

===Canopy crossings===
The removal of trees associated with road construction produces a gap in the [[forest canopy]] that forces arboreal (tree dwelling) species to come to the ground to travel across the gap. Canopy crossings have been constructed for [[red squirrel]]s in Great Britain, [[colobus monkey]]s in Kenya, and [[ringtail possum]]s in Far North Queensland, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood, C. (1999). Book Review: Linkages in the landscape: The role of corridors and connectivity in wildlife conservation. Pacific Conservation Biology 5: 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The crossings have two purposes: to ensure that roads do not restrict movement of animals and also to reduce roadkill. Installation of the canopy crossings may be relatively quick and cheap.

===Escape routes===
Banks, cuttings and fences that trap animals on the road are associated with roadkill.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, R.A., Jones, M.E. and Richardson, A.M.M. (2003) ''Predicting the location of wildlife road-kill in Tasmania'' (In-prep.)&lt;/ref&gt; In order to increase the likelihood of escape from a main roadway, escape routes have been constructed on the access roads. Escape routes may be considered as one of the most useful measures, especially when new roads are being built or roads are being upgraded, widened or sealed. Research may be undertaken into the efficacy of escape routes by observations of animals’ response to vehicles in places with natural escape routes and barriers, rather than trialing purpose-built escape routes.

===Fencing===
In the [[New Forest]], in southern [[England]], there is a proposal to fence roads to protect the [[New Forest pony]].{{citation needed |date=August 2012}} However, this proposal is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7843664.stm |work=BBC News |title=Fencing to protect ponies |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposal==
Removing animal carcasses from roadways is considered essential to public safety.&lt;ref name="Ohio EPA Disposal of roadkill"/&gt; The removal takes away the potential distraction and hazard of the carcass to other motorists.&lt;ref name="Hancock road kills"/&gt; Quick removal can also prevent deaths of other animals that may wish to feed on the carcass, as well as animals that may go into the road to try to move the body of an animal in their social group.&lt;ref name="Psychology Today Animals and Cars"/&gt; Sometimes rather than removal, the carcass is moved to a nearby public right-of-way where it can be enjoyed by wildlife; but not placed in a ditch or where waterways might be polluted.&lt;ref name="Ohio EPA Disposal of roadkill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hancock road kills"/&gt; Covering the carcass with wood chips can aid in decomposition while minimizing odor.&lt;ref name="Ohio EPA Disposal of roadkill"/&gt;

Local governments and other levels of government have services that pick up dead animals from roadways, who will respond when advised about a dead animal.

[[New York City]] has an online request form which may be completed by residents of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dsny/html/contact/requests_dead_animal.shtml "Service Requests: Dead Animal Removal Request"], Department of Sanitation, New York City, accessed Sept. 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York State]] has a process to report dead wildlife to the Department of Environmental Conservation; they are especially interested in marked/tagged wildlife and [[endangered species|endangered]] or [[threatened species]].&lt;ref name="NY State reporting dead wildlife"/&gt;

In [[Toronto]], Canada, the city accepts requests to remove a dead animal by telephone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toronto.ca/311/knowledgebase/43/101000048243.html "Dead animal removal: On City or private property"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017050416/http://www.toronto.ca/311/knowledgebase/43/101000048243.html |date=2014-10-17 }}, City of Toronto, accessed Sept. 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; If an animal is found along a major highway, depending on who has jurisdiction for maintaining the highway, the request may be directed to the City, the provincial Ministry of Transportation, or a highway operations centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toronto.ca/311/knowledgebase/95/101000051295.html toronto.ca], "Dead animal removal: on a City expressway - highways" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017050418/http://www.toronto.ca/311/knowledgebase/95/101000051295.html |date=2014-10-17}}, City of Toronto, accessed Sept. 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ontario, citizens may keep possession of roadkill in many circumstances, but may have to register their find.&lt;ref name="MNRF"&gt;{{cite web |title=Keep a dead wild animal |url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/keep-dead-wild-animal |website=Ontario |publisher=Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eating roadkill==
{{main article|Roadkill cuisine}}
Roadkill can be eaten, and there are several recipe books dedicated to roadkill. The practice of eating animals killed on the road is often derided, and some people consider it not to be safe,&lt;ref name="NY State reporting dead wildlife"/&gt; sanitary, or wholesome. For example, when the Tennessee legislature attempted to legalize the use of accidentally killed animals, they became the subject of stereotyping and derisive humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/14/us/statehouse-journal-a-road-kill-proposal-is-food-for-jokesters.html |work=The New York Times |title=Statehouse Journal; A Road-Kill Proposal Is Food for Jokesters |first=David |last=Firestone |date=1999-03-14 |accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in some cultures there is tradition of using fresh roadkill as a nutritious and economical source of meat similar to that obtained by [[hunting]].

==Cultural references==
===Music===
Songwriter and performer [[Loudon Wainwright III]] released his deadpan humorous song, "[[Dead Skunk|Dead Skunk (in the Middle of the Road)]]" in 1972, and it peaked at number 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1826 |title=Dead Skunk by Loudon Wainwright III Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |date=2008-07-26 |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American band [[Phish]] frequently&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://phish.net/song/possum/history |title= Possum History |last= Steinberg |first=David |work= Phish.net |publisher= The Mockingbird Foundation |accessdate= 2016-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; plays the song "Possum", originally from its album [[The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday]], at its concerts. The song describes an encounter with a roadkilled [[opossum]] and includes the lyric, "Your end is the road."

===Art===
Roadkill is sometimes used as an art form. Several artists use traditional [[taxidermy]] preparation in their works whilst others explore different artforms. International artist Claudia Terstappen photographs roadkill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claudiaterstappen.com/roadkill |title=Roadkill (After Life). — Claudia Terstappen |publisher=Claudiaterstappen.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produces enormous prints which see the animals floating eerily in a void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.placegallery.blogspot.com |title=Place Gallery |publisher=Placegallery.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; American artist Gary Michael Keyes photographs and transforms them into "RoadKill Totems" in his "Resurrection Gallery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://garymichaelkeyes.com/RoadKill-Totems.html |title=The Resurrection Gallery - Turtle Island RoadKill Totems |publisher=Garymichaelkeyes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roadkill as art is not new, American artist [[Stephen Paternite]] has been exhibiting roadkill pieces since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.stroudnewsandjournal.co.uk/mostpopular.var.1713523.mostcommented.roadkill_artist_speaks_of_controversial_work.php |title = Roadkill artist speaks of controversial work |work = Stroud News &amp; Journal|accessdate = 2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Canadian writer [[Timothy Findley]] wrote about the experience of seeing killed animals on highways during travels: "The dead by the road, or on it, testify to the presence of man. Their little gestures of pain—paws, wings and tails—are the saddest, the loneliest, most forlorn postures of the dead I can imagine. When we have stopped killing animals as though they were so much refuse, we will stop killing one another. But the highways show our indifference to death, so long as it is someone else's. It is an attitude of the human mind I do not grasp."&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Findley, from 1965 journal, in ''Journeyman: Travels of a Writer'' (2003, Pebble Publications), {{ISBN|0-00-200673-1}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
There are driving video games where players can run over animals, such as the arcade version of ''[[Cruis'n USA]]'', as well as video games where players control an animal that crosses roads to avoid becoming roadkill, such as ''[[Frogger]]'' and ''[[Crossy Road]]''.{{citation_needed|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17934">A dormant [[seed]] is one that is unable to [[germinate]] in a specified period of time under a combination of environmental factors that are normally suitable for the germination of the non-dormant seed.&lt;ref name="Baskin2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baskin|first=J.M.|author2=Baskin, C.C. |title=A classification system for seed dormancy|journal=Seed Science Research|year=2004|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1079/ssr2003150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dormancy is a mechanism to prevent germination during unsuitable ecological conditions, when the probability of seedling survival is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Black M.|author2=Bewley J.D.  |author3=Halmer P. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Encyclopedia of seeds|year=2006|publisher=CAB International|location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important function of most seeds is delayed germination, which allows time for dispersal and prevents germination of all the seeds at the same time. The staggering of germination safeguards some seeds and seedlings from suffering damage or death from short periods of bad weather or from transient [[herbivore]]s; it also allows some seeds to germinate when competition from other plants for light and water might be less intense. Another form of delayed seed germination is seed quiescence, which is different from true seed dormancy and occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are too dry or warm or cold for germination.&lt;ref name="Fenner2005"&gt;{{cite book| title = The ecology of seeds| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bzflp9q5tNIC&amp;pg=PA97| year = 2005| journal = Publisher Cambridge University Press| page = 98| isbn = 978-0-521-65368-8| last1 = Fenner| first1 =  Michael| last2 =  Thompson| first2 =  Ken| accessdate = 2009-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species of plants have seeds that delay germination for many months or years, and some seeds can remain in the soil seed bank for more than 50 years before germination. Some seeds have a very long viability period, and the oldest documented germinating seed was nearly 2000 years old based on [[radiocarbon dating]].&lt;ref&gt;Randolph E. Schmid [https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2008-06-12-3360628840_x.htm Tree from 2,000-year-old seed is doing well]. AP via USA Today, June 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
True dormancy or innate dormancy is caused by conditions within the seed that prevent germination under normally ideal conditions. Often seed dormancy is divided into two major categories based on what part of the seed produces dormancy: exogenous and endogenous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtbg.tas.gov.au/index.aspx?base=302 Different Types of Seed Dormancy | Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322063913/http://www.rtbg.tas.gov.au//index.aspx?base=302 |date=2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of dormancy based on their mode of action: physical, physiological and morphological.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = The ecology of seeds| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bzflp9q5tNIC&amp;pg=PA97| year = 2005| journal = Publisher Cambridge University Press| page = 97| isbn = 978-0-521-65368-8| last1 = Fenner     | first1 =  Michael| last2 =  Thompson     | first2 =  Ken| accessdate = 2009-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of classification schemes developed to group different dormant seeds, but none have gained universal usage. Dormancy occurs because of a wide range of reasons that often overlap, producing conditions in which definitive categorization is not clear. Compounding this problem is that the same seed that is dormant for one reason at a given point may be dormant for another reason at a later point. Some seeds fluctuate from periods of dormancy to non dormancy, and despite the fact that a dormant seed appears to be static or inert, in

==Exogenous dormancy==
Exogenous dormancy is caused by conditions outside the embryo and is often broken down into three subgroups:

===Physical dormancy===
Dormancy that is caused by an impermeable seed coat is known as physical dormancy. Physical dormancy is the result of impermeable layer(s) that develops during maturation and drying of the seed or fruit.&lt;ref name="offord"&gt;Offord, C.A. and Meagher, P.F. (2009). Plant germplasm conservation in Australia: strategies and guidelines for developing,managing and utilising ex situ collections. Canberra: Australian Network for Plant Conservation Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;   This impermeable layer prevents the seed from taking up water or gases. As a result, the seed is prevented from germinating until dormancy is broken. In natural systems, physical dormancy is broken by several factors including high temperatures, fluctuating temperatures, fire, freezing/thawing, drying or passage through the digestive tracts of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Baskin C.C.  |author2=Baskin J.M. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Seeds: Ecology, Biogeography, and Evolution of Dormancy and Germination|year=1998|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physical dormancy is believed to have developed &gt;100 mya.&lt;ref name="baskin2000"&gt;Baskin, J.M. and Baskin, C.C. and Li, X. (2000). "Taxonomy, anatomy and evolution of physical dormancy in seeds". Plant Species Biology 15: 139-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once physical dormancy is broken it cannot be reinstated i.e. the seed is unable to enter secondary dormancy following unfavourable conditions unlike seeds with physiological dormancy mechanisms.&lt;ref name="baskin1998"&gt;Baskin C.C. and Baskin J.M. (1998). Seeds: Ecology, Biogeography, and Evolution of Dormancy and Germination. San Diego: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the timing of the mechanisms that breaks physical dormancy is critical and must be tuned to environmental cues. This maximises the chances for germination occurring in conditions where the plant will successfully germinate, establish and eventually reproduce.&lt;ref name="baskin2000"/&gt;

Physical dormancy has been identified in the seeds of plants across 16 angiosperm families including:
*Anacardiaceae
*Asteraceae
*Bixaceae
*Cannaceae (monocot) 
*Cistaceae
*Cochlospermaceae
*Convolvulaceae 
*Cucurbitaceae
*Dipterocarpaceae
*Geraniaceae
*Legumeinosae 
*Malvaceae 
*Nelumbonaceae
*Rhamnaceae 
*Sarcolaenaceae
*Sapindaceae&lt;ref name="baskin2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="baskin2003"&gt;Baskin, C.C. (2003). "Breaking physical dormancy in seeds - focussing on the lens".

Nutt. by in-dark seed selection and breeding Industrial Crops and Products 26(1):88–93&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical dormancy has not been recorded in any gymnosperms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baskin|first1=Carol C. Baskin, Jerry M.|title=Seeds : ecology, biogeography, and evolution of dormancy and germination|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-12-416677-6|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, physical dormancy is the result of one or more palisade layers in the fruit or seed coat. These layers are lignified with malphigian cells tightly packed together and impregnated with water-repellent.&lt;ref name="baskin2003" /&gt; In the Anacardiaceae and Nelumbonaceae families the seed coat is not well developed. Therefore, palisade layers in the fruit perform the functional role of preventing water uptake . While physical dormancy is a common feature, several species in these families do not have physical dormancy or produce non-dormant seeds.&lt;ref name="baskin2000" /&gt;

Specialised structures, which function as a "water-gap", are associated with the impermeable layers of the seed to prevent the uptake of water.&lt;ref name="baskin2000" /&gt; The water-gap is closed at seed maturity and is opened in response to the appropriate environmental signal.&lt;ref name="baskin2003" /&gt;  Breaking physical dormancy involves the disruption of these specialised structures within the seed, and acts as an environmental signal detector for germination.&lt;ref name="baskin2000" /&gt; For example, legume (Fabaceae) seeds become permeable after the thin-walled cells of lens (water-gap structure).&lt;ref name="baskin2003" /&gt; Following disrupted pulls apart to allow water entry into the seed.Other water gap structures include carpellary micropyle, bixoid chalazal plug, imbibition lid and the suberised ‘stopper’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boesewinkel|first=F.D.|title=The seed structure and taxonomic relationships of Hypseocharis Remy|journal=Acta Botanic Neerlandica|year=1988|volume=37|pages=111–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Boesewinkel F.D.  |author2=Bouman F. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The seed: Structure.

In nature, the seed coats of physically dormant seeds are thought to become water permeable over time through repeated heating and cooling over many months-years in the soil seedbank.&lt;ref name="offord" /&gt; For example, the high and fluctuating temperatures during the dry season in northern Australia promote dormancy break in impermeable seeds of ''Stylosanthes humilis'' and ''S.hamata'' (Fabaceae).&lt;ref name="baskin2003" /&gt;

===Mechanical dormancy===
Mechanical dormancy occurs when seed coats or other coverings are too hard to allow the embryo to expand during germination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trc.ucdavis.edu/egsutter/plb171/lecturespdf4/5-Seed%20dormancy02.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322114553/http://trc.ucdavis.edu/egsutter/plb171/lecturespdf4/5-Seed%20dormancy02.pdf |date=March 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past this mechanism of dormancy was ascribed to a number of species that have been found to have endogenous factors for their dormancy instead. These endogenous factors include low embryo growth potential.&lt;ref name="rtbg.tas.gov.au"&gt;[http://gardens.rtbg.tas.gov.au/exogenous-dormancy/ Exogenous Dormancy | Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical dormancy===
Includes growth regulators etc., that are present in the coverings around the embryo. They may be leached out of the tissues by washing or soaking the seed, or deactivated by other means. Other chemicals that prevent germination are washed out of the seeds by rainwater or snow melt.

==Endogenous dormancy==
Endogenous dormancy is caused by conditions within the embryo itself, and it is also often broken down into three subgroups: physiological dormancy, morphological dormancy and combined dormancy, each of these groups may also have subgroups.

===Physiological dormancy===
Physiological dormancy prevents embryo growth and seed germination until chemical changes occur. Physiological dormancy is indicated when an increase in germination rate occurs after an application of [[gibberellic acid]] (GA3) or after Dry after-ripening or dry storage. It is also indicated when dormant seed embryos are excised and produce healthy seedlings: or when up to 3 months of cold (0–10&amp;nbsp;°C) or warm (=15&amp;nbsp;°C) stratification increases germination: or when dry after-ripening shortens the cold stratification period required. In some seeds physiological dormancy is indicated when scarification increases germination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtbg.tas.gov.au/index.aspx?base=308 Physiological Dormancy | Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322052844/http://www.rtbg.tas.gov.au//index.aspx?base=308 |date=2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physiological dormancy is broken when inhibiting chemicals are broken down or are no longer produced by the seed; often by a period of cool moist conditions, normally below (+4C) 39F, or in the case of many species in ''[[Ranunculaceae]]'' and a few others,(−5C) 24F. [[Abscisic acid]] is usually the growth inhibitor in seeds and its production can be affected by light. Some plants like [[Peony]] species have multiple types of physiological dormancy, one affects radicle (root) growth while the other affects plumule (shoot) growth. 
*'''Drying'''; some plants including a number of grasses and those from seasonally arid regions need a period of drying before they will germinate, the seeds are released but need to have a lower moisture content before germination can begin. If the seeds remain moist after dispersal, germination can be delayed for many months or even years. Many herbaceous plants from temperate climate zones have physiological dormancy that disappears with drying of the seeds. 
*'''Photodormancy''' or light sensitivity affects germination of some seeds. These photoblastic seeds need a period of darkness or light to germinate.  In species with thin seed coats, [[light]] may be able to penetrate into the dormant embryo. The presence of light or the absence of light may trigger the germination process, inhibiting germination in some seeds buried too deeply or in others not buried in the soil.
*'''Thermodormancy''' is seed sensitivity to heat or cold. Some seeds including [[cocklebur]] and [[amaranth]] germinate only at high temperatures (30C or 86F).  Many plants that have seeds that germinate in early to mid summer have thermodormancy and germinate only when the soil temperature is warm. Other seeds need cool soils to germinate, while others like celery are inhibited when soil temperatures are too warm.  Often thermodormancy requirements disappear as the seed ages or dries.
Seeds are classified as having deep physiological dormancy under these conditions: applications of GA3 does not increase germination; or when excised embryos produce abnormal seedlings; or when seeds require more than 3 months of cold stratification to germinate.

===Morphological dormancy===
In morphological dormancy, the embryo is underdeveloped or undifferentiated. Some seeds have fully differentiated embryos that need to grow more before seed germination, or the embryos are not differentiated into different tissues at the time of fruit ripening.
*Immature embryos – some plants release their seeds before the tissues of the embryos have fully differentiated, and the seeds ripen after they take in water while on the ground, germination can be delayed from a few weeks to a few months.

===Combined dormancy===
These seeds have both morphological and physiological dormancy.

* '''Morpho-physiological''' or '''morphophysiological dormancy''' occurs when seeds with underdeveloped embryos, also have physiological components to dormancy. These seeds therefore require dormancy-breaking treatments as well as a period of time to develop fully grown embryos.
* Intermediate simple 
* Deep simple 
* Deep simple epicotyl 
* Deep simple double 
* Intermediate complex 
* Deep complex

==Combinational dormancy==
Combinational dormancy occurs in some seeds, where dormancy is caused by both exogenous (physical) and
endogenous (physiological) conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Flower seeds: biology and technology CABI Publishing Series| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WBw_EJSRNrYC&amp;pg=PA161| year = 2005| journal = Publisher CABI| page = 167| isbn = 0-85199-906-9 | last1 = McDonald | first1 =  M.

==Secondary dormancy==
Secondary dormancy occurs in some non-dormant and post dormant seeds that are exposed to conditions that are not favorable for germination, like high temperatures. It is caused by conditions that occur after the seed has been dispersed.  The mechanisms of secondary dormancy are not yet fully understood but might involve the loss of sensitivity in receptors in the plasma membrane.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley, J. Derek, and Michael Black. 1994. ''Seeds physiology of development and germination. The language of science''. New York: Plenum Press. page 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all seeds undergo a period of dormancy, many species of plants release their seeds late in the year when the soil temperature is too low for germination or when the environment is dry.  If these seeds are collected and sown in an environment that is warm enough, and/or moist enough, they will germinate. Under natural conditions non dormant seeds released late in the growing season wait until spring when the soil temperature rises or in the case of seeds dispersed during dry periods until it rains and there is enough soil moisture.

Seeds that do not germinate because they have fleshy fruits that retard germination are quiescent, not dormant.&lt;ref name="rtbg.tas.gov.au"/&gt;

Many garden plants have seeds that will germinate readily as soon as they have water and are warm enough, though their wild ancestors had dormancy. These cultivated plants lack seed dormancy because of generations of selective pressure by plant breeders and gardeners that grew and kept plants that lacked dormancy.

Seeds of some [[mangrove]]s are viviparous and begin to germinate while still attached to the parent; they produce a large, heavy root, which allows the seed to penetrate into the ground when it falls.

==Taxonomy==
Scottish botanist [[David Don]] described the redwood as the evergreen taxodium (''Taxodium sempervirens'') in his colleague [[Aylmer Bourke Lambert]]'s 1824 work ''A description of the genus Pinus''.&lt;ref name="don 1824"&gt;{{cite book|last=Don|first=David|title=A description of the genus Pinus :illustrated with figures, directions relative to the cultivation, and remarks on the uses of the several species|editor=Lambert, Aylmer Bourke |publisher=J. White|location=London, United Kingdom|date=1824|volume=2|pages=24|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/30944674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian botanist [[Stephan Endlicher]] erected the genus ''[[Sequoia (genus)|Sequoia]]'' in his 1847 work ''Synopsis coniferarum'', giving the redwood its current binomial name of ''Sequoia sempervirens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Endlicher|first=Stephan|title=Synopsis Coniferarum|volume=1847|publisher=Scheitlin &amp; Zollikofer|location=St. Gallen|date=1847|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15191847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endlicher probably derived the name Sequoia from the Cherokee name of George Gist, usually spelled Sequoyah, who developed the still-used Cherokee syllabary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bulletin of the Southern California Academy of Science|volume = 116|year = 2017|pages = 137–146|last =  Muleady-Mecham|first = Nancy E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redwood is one of three living species, each in its own genus, in the subfamily [[Sequoioideae]]. Molecular studies have shown that the three are each other's closest relatives, generally with the redwood and giant sequoia (''[[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]'') as each other's closest relatives. However, Yang and colleagues in 2010 queried the polyploid state of the redwood and speculate that it may have arisen as an ancient hybrid between ancestors of the giant sequoia and dawn redwood (''[[Metasequoia]]''). Using two different single copy [[nuclear gene]]s, [[Leafy|LFY]] and [[NLY]], to generate [[phylogenetic tree]]s, they found that ''Sequoia'' was clustered with ''Metasequoia'' in the tree generated using the LFY gene, but with ''Sequoiadendron ''in the tree generated with the NLY gene. Further analysis strongly supported the hypothesis that ''Sequoia'' was the result of a [[hybridization event]] involving ''Metasequoia'' and ''Sequoiadendron''. Thus, Yang and colleagues hypothesize that the inconsistent relationships among ''Metasequoia'', ''Sequoia,'' and ''Sequoiadendron'' could be a sign of [[reticulate evolution]] (in which two species hybridize and give rise to a third) among the three genera. However, the long evolutionary history of the three genera (the earliest fossil remains being from the [[Jurassic]]) make resolving the specifics of when and how ''Sequoia'' originated once and for all a difficult matter—especially since it in part depends on an incomplete [[fossil]] record.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Three Genome-based Phylogeny of Cupressaceae s.l: Further Evidence for the Evolution of Gymnosperms and Southern Hemisphere Biogeography|year = 2012|last = Yang|first = Z.Y.|last2 = Ran|first2 = J.H.|last3 = Wang|first3 = X.Q.|journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume = 64|issue = 3|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2012.05.004|pages=452–470|pmid=22609823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Coast redwood bark.jpg|thumb|left|Bark detail]]

The coast redwood can reach {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall with a trunk diameter of {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Flora of North America"&gt;{{eFloras|1|200005399|Sequoia sempervirens |first=Frank D. |last=Watson |volume=2 |access-date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] [[Crown (botany)|crown]], with horizontal to slightly drooping branches. The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] can be very thick, up to {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}, and quite soft and fibrous, with a bright red-brown color when freshly exposed (hence the name redwood), weathering darker. The [[root]] system is composed of shallow, wide-spreading lateral roots.

The [[leaf|leaves]] are variable, being {{convert|15|–|25|mm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} long and flat on young trees and shaded shoots in the lower crown of old trees. On the other hand, they are scale-like, {{convert|5|–|10|mm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} long on shoots in full sun in the upper crown of older trees, with a full range of transition between the two extremes. They are dark green above and have two blue-white [[stomata]]l bands below. Leaf arrangement is spiral, but the larger shade leaves are twisted at the base to lie in a flat plane for maximum light capture.

The species is [[plant sexuality|monoecious]], with pollen and seed cones on the same plant. The [[Conifer cone|seed cones]] are ovoid, {{convert|15|–|32|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} long, with 15–25 spirally arranged scales; [[pollination]] is in late winter with maturation about 8–9 months after. Each cone scale bears three to seven [[seed]]s, each seed {{convert|3|–|4|mm|frac=16|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.5|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} broad, with two wings {{convert|1|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide. The seeds are released when the cone scales dry out and open at maturity. The pollen cones are ovular and {{convert|4|–|6|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} long.

Its [[genetics|genetic]] makeup is unusual among conifers, being a [[polyploid|hexaploid]] (6n) and possibly [[Polyploidy#Terminology|allopolyploid]] (AAAABB).&lt;ref name=Ahuja2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahuja|first=MR|last2=Neale|first2=DB|title=Origins of Polyploidy in Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and Relationship of Coast Redwood to other Genera of Taxodiaceae|journal=Silvae Genetica|volume=51|issue=2–3|pages=93–100|year=2002|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevailing elevation range is {{convert|98|–|2460|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} above sea level, occasionally down to 0 and up to 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft (about 920 m).&lt;ref&gt;Farjon, A. (2005). ''Monograph of Cupressaceae and Sciadopitys''. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. {{ISBN|1-84246-068-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They usually grow in the mountains where precipitation from the incoming moisture off the ocean is greater. The tallest and oldest trees are found in deep valleys and gullies, where year-round streams can flow, and fog drip is regular. The trees above the fog layer, above about {{convert|2296|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}, are shorter and smaller due to the drier, windier, and colder conditions. In addition, [[Douglas fir]], [[pine]], and [[tanoak]] often crowd out redwoods at these elevations. Few redwoods grow close to the ocean, due to intense salt spray, sand, and wind. [[Coalescence (physics)|Coalescence]] of coastal fog accounts for a considerable part of the trees' water needs.&lt;ref name=Bionet1998&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/ag-forst/1998-December/012213.html|title=Redwood fog drip |publisher=Bio.net |date=1998-12-02 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern boundary of its range is marked by groves on the [[Chetco River]] on the western fringe of the [[Klamath Mountains]], near the California-Oregon border. The largest (and tallest) populations are in [[Redwood National and State Parks]] ([[Del Norte County, California|Del Norte]] and [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt]] Counties) and [[Humboldt Redwoods State Park]] ([[Humboldt County, California]]), with the majority located in the much larger Humboldt County. The southern boundary of its range is the [[Los Padres National Forest]]'s [[Silver Peak Wilderness]] in the [[Santa Lucia Mountains]] of the [[Big Sur]] area of [[Monterey County, California]]. The southernmost grove is in the Southern Redwood Botanical Area, just north of the national forest's Salmon Creek trailhead.&lt;ref name=Redwoodhikes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoodhikes.com/Big%20Sur/Los%20Padres.html|title=Los Padres National Forest |publisher=Redwoodhikes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southernmost grove can be seen from [[California Highway 1]] at the approximate coordinates 35°49'42 N 121°23'14 W.

The prehistoric [[fossil]] range of the genus is considerably greater, with a subcosmopolitan distribution including Europe and Asia until about 5 million years ago. During the last [[ice age]], perhaps as recently as 10,000 years ago, redwood trees grew as far south as the Los Angeles area (coast redwood bark found in subway excavations and at [[La Brea Tar Pits|La Brea tar pits]]).

==Ecology==
This native area provides a unique environment with heavy seasonal rains up to {{convert|100|in|mm}} annually. Cool coastal air and [[fog drip]] keep this forest consistently damp year round. Several factors, including the heavy rainfall, create a soil with fewer nutrients than the trees need, causing them to depend heavily on the entire biotic community of the forest, especially complete recycling of the trees when dead. This forest community includes [[coast Douglas fir]], [[Pacific madrone]], [[tanoak]], [[western hemlock]], and other trees, along with a wide variety of [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es, [[fungus|mushrooms]], and [[redwood sorrel]]. Redwood forests provide habitat for a variety of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. [[Old-growth]] redwood stands provide habitat for the federally threatened [[spotted owl]] and the California-endangered [[marbled murrelet]].

Coast redwoods are resistant to insect attack, fungal infection, and rot. These properties are conferred by concentrations of [[terpenoid]]s and [[tannic acid]] in redwood leaves, roots, bark, and wood.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Despite these chemical defenses, redwoods are still subject to insect infestations; none, however, are capable of killing a healthy tree.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Redwoods also face predation from mammals: [[American black bear|black bears]] are reported to consume the inner bark of small redwoods, and [[black-tailed deer]] are known to eat redwood sprouts.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

The oldest known coast redwood is about 2,200 years old;&lt;ref name=Gymnosperm/&gt; many others in the wild exceed 600 years. The numerous claims of older redwoods are incorrect.&lt;ref name=Gymnosperm/&gt; Because of their seemingly timeless lifespans, coast redwoods were deemed the "everlasting redwood" at the turn of the century; in [[Latin]], ''sempervirens'' means "ever green" or "everlasting". Redwoods must endure various environmental disturbances to attain such great ages. In response to forest fires, the trees have developed various adaptations. The thick, fibrous bark of coast redwoods is extremely fire-resistant; it grows to at least a foot thick and protects mature trees from fire damage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Shirely, James Clifford. 1940. ''[https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/shirley/index.htm The Redwoods of Coast and Sierra].'' University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the redwoods contain little flammable pitch or resin.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If damaged by fire, a redwood readily sprouts new branches or even an entirely new crown,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; and if the parent tree is killed, new buds sprout from its base.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Fires, moreover, appear to actually benefit redwoods by causing substantial mortality in competing species while having only minor effects on redwood. Burned areas are favorable to the successful germination of redwood seeds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pocket flora of the redwood forest|last=1922-|first=Becking, Rudolf Willem,|date=1982-01-01|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-0933280021|oclc=904189212}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 2010, the first to compare post-wildfire survival and regeneration of redwood and associated species, concluded fires of all severity increase the relative abundance of redwood and higher-severity fires provide the greatest benefit.&lt;ref name="Ramage2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ramage, B.S. |author2=OʼHara, K.L. |author3=Caldwell, B.T. |year= 2010 |title= The role of fire in the competitive dynamics of coast redwood forests|journal=Ecosphere |volume=1 |issue=6| at= article 20 |doi=10.1890/ES10-00134.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redwoods often grow in flood-prone areas. Sediment deposits can form impermeable barriers that suffocate tree roots, and unstable soil in flooded areas often causes trees to lean to one side, increasing the risk of the wind toppling them. Immediately after a flood, redwoods grow their existing roots upwards into recently deposited sediment layers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Edward C.|last2=Vasey|first2=Richard B.|date=January 12, 1968|title=Preservation of Coast Redwoods on Alluvial Flats|url=https://www.jstor.org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/stable/1723263?pq-origsite=summon&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Science|volume=159|issue=3811|pages=157–161|doi=10.1126/science.159.3811.157|pmid=17792349|bibcode=1968Sci...159..157S}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second root system then develops from adventitious buds on the newly buried trunk and the old root system dies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To counter lean, redwoods increase wood production on the vulnerable side, creating a supporting buttress.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These adaptations create forests of almost exclusively redwood trees in flood-prone regions.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The height of ''S.&amp;nbsp;sempervirens'' is closely tied to fog availability; taller trees become less frequent as fog becomes less frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Relationship of convection fog to characteristics of the vegetation of Redwood National Park|last = Harris|first = S.

===Reproduction===
[[File:Sequoia Sempervirens Ring.JPG|thumb|A ring of redwoods as seen from below]]

Coast redwood reproduces both sexually by seed and asexually by sprouting of buds, layering, or [[lignotuber]]s. Seed production begins at 10–15 years of age. Cones develop in the winter and mature by fall. In the early stages, the cones look like [[flower]]s, and are commonly called "flowers" by professional foresters, although this is not strictly correct. Coast redwoods produce many cones, with redwoods in new forests producing thousands per year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The cones themselves hold 90–150 seeds, but viability of seed is low, typically well below 15% with one estimate of average rates being 3 to 10 percent.&lt;ref name=ucberkeley1&gt;{{cite web|title=Botanical Garden Logistics|work=UC Berkeley – Biology 1B – Plants &amp; Their Environments (p. 13)|publisher=Department of Integrative Biology, University of California-Berkeley|location=Berkeley, California|url=http://ib.berkeley.edu/courses/bio1b/labschedfall07/labexercises/PlantsEnvironments3_4_3.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513135321/http://ib.berkeley.edu/courses/bio1b/labschedfall07/labexercises/PlantsEnvironments3_4_3.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-13|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The low viability may discourage seed predators, which do not want to waste time sorting [[chaff]] (empty seeds) from edible seeds. Successful germination often requires a fire or flood, reducing competition for seedlings. The winged seeds are small and light, weighing 3.3–5.0&amp;nbsp;mg (200–300 seeds/g; 5,600–8,500/ounce). The wings are not effective for wide dispersal, and seeds are dispersed by wind an average of only {{convert|60|–|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the parent tree. Seedlings are susceptible to fungal infection and predation by [[banana slug]]s, [[Brush rabbit|bush rabbits]], and [[nematode]]s.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Most seedlings do not survive their first three years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, those that become established grow very fast, with young trees known to reach {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall in 20 years.

Coast redwoods can also reproduce asexually by layering or sprouting from the root crown, stump, or even fallen branches; if a tree falls over, it generates a row of new trees along the trunk, so many trees naturally grow in a straight line. Sprouts originate from dormant or adventitious buds at or under the surface of the bark. The dormant sprouts are stimulated when the main adult stem gets damaged or starts to die. Many sprouts spontaneously erupt and develop around the circumference of the tree trunk. Within a short period after sprouting, each sprout develops its own root system, with the dominant sprouts forming a ring of trees around the parent root crown or stump. This ring of trees is called a "fairy ring". Sprouts can achieve heights of {{convert|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in a single growing season.

Redwoods may also reproduce using [[burl]]s. A burl is a woody [[lignotuber]] that commonly appears on a redwood tree below the soil line, though usually within {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} in depth from the soil surface. Coast redwoods develop burls as seedlings from the axils of their [[cotyledon]], a trait that is extremely rare in conifers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When provoked by damage, dormant buds in the burls sprout new shoots and roots. Burls are also capable of sprouting into new trees when detached from the parent tree, though exactly how this happens is yet to be studied. Shoot clones commonly sprout from burls and are often turned into decorative hedges when found in suburbia.

Coast redwood is one of the most valuable [[timber]] species in the lumbering industry. In California, {{convert|899000|acre|km2}} of redwood forest are logged, virtually all of it second growth.&lt;ref name=IUCNredlist1&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|work=Species Survival Commission|publisher=|location=|year=|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/34051/all|accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many entities have existed in the cutting and management of redwoods, perhaps none has had a more storied role than the [[Pacific Lumber Company]] (1863–2008) of Humboldt County, California, where it owned and managed over {{convert|200000|acre|km2}} of forests, primarily redwood. Coast redwood lumber is highly valued for its beauty, light weight, and resistance to decay. Its lack of resin makes it resistant to fire.

P.H. Shaughnessy, Chief Engineer of the [[San Francisco]] Fire Department wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the recent [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|great fire]] of San Francisco, that began April 18th, 1906, we succeeded in finally stopping it in nearly all directions where the unburned buildings were almost entirely of frame construction, and if the exterior finish of these buildings had not been of redwood lumber, I am satisfied that the area of the burned district would have been greatly extended.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of its impressive resistance to decay, redwood was extensively used for [[railroad ties]] and [[trestle]]s throughout California. Many of the old ties have been recycled for use in gardens as borders, steps, house beams, etc. Redwood burls are used in the production of table tops, veneers, and turned goods.

The [[Yurok]] people, who occupied the region before European settlement, regularly burned off ground cover in redwood forests to bolster [[Notholithocarpus|tanoak]] populations from which they harvested acorns, to maintain forest openings, and to boost populations of useful plant species such as those for medicine or basketmaking.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Redwood Forest: History, Ecology, and Conservation of the Coast Redwoods|last=Noss|first=Reed|last2=|first2=|publisher=Island Press|year=2000|isbn=978-1559637268|location=|pages=|oclc=925183647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive logging of redwoods began in the early nineteenth century. The trees were felled by ax and saw onto beds of tree limbs and shrubs to cushion their fall.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Stripped of their bark, the logs were transported to mills or waterways by oxen or horse.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Loggers then burned the accumulated tree limbs, shrubs, and bark. The repeated fires favored [[secondary forest]]s of primarily redwoods as redwood seedlings sprout readily in burned areas.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Lowell, Phillip G. (1990).

California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of steam engines let crews drag logs through long skid trails to nearby railroads,&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; furthering the reach of loggers beyond the land nearby rivers previously used to transport trees.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This method of harvesting, however, disturbed large amounts of soil, producing secondary-growth forests of species other than redwood such as [[Douglas fir|Douglas-fir]], [[Abies grandis|grand fir]], and [[Tsuga heterophylla|western hemlock]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; After World War II, trucks and tractors gradually replaced steam engines, giving rise to two harvesting approaches: [[clearcutting]] and selection harvesting. Clearcutting involved felling all the trees in a particular area. It was encouraged by tax laws that exempted all standing timber from taxation if 70% of trees in the area were harvested.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Selection logging, by contrast, called for the removal 25% to 50% of mature trees in the hopes that the remaining trees would allow for future growth and reseeding.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This method, however, encouraged growth of other tree species, converting redwood forests into mixed forests of redwood, grand fir, [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]], and western hemlock.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Moreover, the trees left standing were often felled by [[windthrow]]; that is, they were often blown over by the wind.

The coast redwood is [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in New Zealand, notably at [[Redwoods Forest, Whakarewarewa|Whakarewarewa]] Forest, [[Rotorua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redwoods.co.nz/ | title=Kia Ora - Welcome to The Redwoods Whakarewarewa Forest |  publisher=Rotorua District Council|accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redwood has been grown in New Zealand plantations for over 100 years, and those planted in New Zealand have higher growth rates than those in California, mainly due to even rainfall distribution through the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nzredwood.co.nz/history.php | title=Redwood History | publisher=The New Zealand Redwood Company | accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sit-ups punishment''' (Uthak Baithak) is a form of punishment given in schools of Indian subcontinent, specially in [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Pakistan]]. In this punishment, one has to sit down and stand up continuously and count the number of sit-ups. It is a common punishment in schools. Generally students are asked to perform this with holding their ears with hands. For humiliation, it is done in front of other students. Normally given in the range of 10 to 100 sit up for boys and 10-50 sit up for girls.
==Variants==
There are many forms of this punishment.
===Simple Situps===
The student will do situps holding his ears. The hands should be ninety degrees with the body. Also he/she has to count loudly with every step. If the count is not hearable the term will repeat. Every term he/she has to sit fully so that his back touch the heals and to stand straight.
===Criss-Cross Earholding===
The punished will hold his/her left year with right hand and right ear with left hand. This may cause hardness and humilation to the punishment. It is famous mostly.
===Pairing Situps===
There will be more than one student and they will hold ears of one another and do the situps. This makes the punishment more hard as the punished have to take weight of anothers. Also criss-cross  earholding can be applied here. Then it will be extra hard to complete.
===Situps touching heals===
It is also varient used with the simple situps. Here the punished's heals should touch one another. This will cause friction between the knees for that he/she can fall. Criss-cross earholding can be applied here..
===Other Varients===
Doing situps in the sun, situps with leaving tough are other types of punishment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47330">In the context of [[software engineering]], '''software quality''' refers to two related but distinct notions that exist wherever [[Quality (business)|quality]] is defined in a business context:

* Software functional quality reflects how well it complies with or conforms to a given design, based on [[functional requirements]] or specifications. That attribute can also be described as the fitness for purpose of a piece of software or how it compares to competitors in the marketplace as a worthwhile [[Product (business)|product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pressman |first=Roger S. |author-link=Roger S. Pressman |year=2005 |title=Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach |edition=Sixth International |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |page=388 |isbn=0071267824}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the degree to which the [[Software verification and validation#Software validation|correct]] software was produced.
* Software structural quality refers to how it meets [[non-functional requirements]] that support the delivery of the functional requirements, such as robustness or maintainability. It has a lot more to do with the degree to which the software works as [[Software verification and validation#Software verification|needed]].

Many aspects of structural quality can be evaluated only [[Static testing|statically]] through the analysis of the software inner structure, its source code, at the unit level, the technology level and the system level, which is in effect how its architecture adheres to sound principles of [[software architecture]] outlined in a paper on the topic by OMG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omg.org/CISQ_compliant_IT_Systemsv.4-3.pdf |title=How to Deliver Resilient, Secure, Efficient, and Easily Changed IT Systems in Line with CISQ Recommendations |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228132152/http://www.omg.org/CISQ_compliant_IT_Systemsv.4-3.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But some structural qualities, such as [[usability]], can be [[usability testing#Methods|assessed]] only [[Dynamic testing|dynamically]] (users or others acting in their behalf interact with the software or, at least, some prototype or partial implementation; even the interaction with a mock version made in cardboard represents a dynamic test because such version can be considered a prototype). Other aspects, such as reliability, might involve not only the software but also the underlying hardware, therefore, it can be assessed both statically and dynamically ([[Stress testing (software)|stress test]]).

Functional quality is typically assessed dynamically but it is also possible to use static tests (such as [[software review]]s).

Historically, the structure, classification and terminology of attributes and metrics applicable to [[software quality management]] have been derived or extracted from the [[ISO 9126|ISO 9126-3]] and the subsequent ISO 25000:2005&lt;ref name="iso25000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_isoiec25000%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf |title=ISO 25000:2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414112148/http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_isoiec25000%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; quality model, also known as SQuaRE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/IEC 25010:2011|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=35733|publisher=ISO|accessdate=14 March 2016|ref=ISO/IEC 25010:2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314115231/http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=35733|archivedate=14 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these models, the [[CISQ|Consortium for IT Software Quality]] (CISQ) has defined five major desirable structural characteristics needed for a piece of software to provide [[business value]]: Reliability, Efficiency, Security, Maintainability and (adequate) Size.

Software quality measurement quantifies to what extent a software program or system rates along each of these five dimensions. An aggregated measure of software quality can be computed through a qualitative or a quantitative scoring scheme or a mix of both and then a weighting system reflecting the priorities. This view of software quality being positioned on a linear continuum is supplemented by the analysis of "critical programming errors" that under specific circumstances can lead to catastrophic outages or performance degradations that make a given system unsuitable for use regardless of rating based on aggregated measurements. Such programming errors found at the system level represent up to 90% of production issues, whilst at the unit-level, even if far more numerous, programming errors account for less than 10% of production issues. As a consequence, code quality without the context of the whole system, as [[W. Edwards Deming]] described it, has limited value.

To view, explore, analyze, and communicate software quality measurements, concepts and techniques of [[information visualization]] provide visual, interactive means useful, in particular, if several software quality measures have to be related to each other or to components of a software or system.

== Motivation ==
"A science is as mature as its measurement tools," (Louis Pasteur in {{Harvnb|Ebert|Dumke|p=91}}). Measuring software quality is motivated by at least two reasons:

* Risk Management: Software failure has caused more than inconvenience. Software errors have caused human fatalities. The causes have ranged from poorly designed user interfaces to direct [[programming error]]s. An example of a programming error that led to multiple deaths is discussed in Dr. Leveson's paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/therac.pdf Medical Devices: The Therac-25*] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216083852/http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/therac.pdf |date=2008-02-16 }}, Nancy Leveson, University of Washington&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in requirements for the development of some types of software, particularly and historically for [[Embedded software|software embedded]] in medical and other devices that regulate critical infrastructures: "[Engineers who write embedded software] see Java programs stalling for one third of a second to perform garbage collection and update the user interface, and they envision airplanes falling out of the sky.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/02/embsoft/embsoftwre.pdf Embedded Software] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705084849/http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/02/embsoft/embsoftwre.pdf |date=2010-07-05 }}, Edward A.

* Cost Management: As in any other fields of engineering, an application with good structural software quality costs less to maintain and is easier to understand and change in response to pressing business needs. Industry data demonstrate that poor application structural quality in core [[business application]]s (such as [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) or large [[transaction processing]] systems in financial services) results in cost and schedule overruns and creates waste in the form of rework (up to 45% of development time in some organizations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralphyoung.net/conferences/ImprovingQuality2.ppt Improving Quality Through Better Requirements (Slideshow)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326194956/http://www.ralphyoung.net/conferences/ImprovingQuality2.ppt |date=2012-03-26 }}, Dr. Ralph R. Young, 24/01/2004, Northrop Grumman Information Technology&lt;/ref&gt;). Moreover, poor structural quality is strongly correlated with high-impact business disruptions due to corrupted data, application outages, security breaches, and performance problems.

However, the distinction between measuring and improving software quality in an embedded system (with emphasis on risk management) and software quality in business software (with emphasis on cost and maintainability management) is becoming somewhat irrelevant. Embedded systems now often include a user interface and their designers are as much concerned with issues affecting usability and user productivity as their counterparts who focus on business applications. The latter are in turn looking at ERP or CRM system as a corporate nervous system whose uptime and performance are vital to the well-being of the enterprise. This convergence is most visible in mobile computing: a user who accesses an ERP application on their [[smartphone]] is depending on the quality of software across all types of software layers.

Both types of software now use multi-layered technology stacks and complex architecture so software quality analysis and measurement have to be managed in a comprehensive and consistent manner, decoupled from the software's ultimate purpose or use. In both cases, engineers and management need to be able to make rational decisions based on measurement and fact-based analysis in adherence to the precept ''[[W. Edwards Deming#Quotations and concepts|"In God (we) trust. All others bring data"]].'' ((mis-)attributed to [[W. Edwards Deming]] and others).

== Definitions ==
There are many different definitions of quality. For some it is the "capability of a software product to conform to requirements." (ISO/IEC 9001,&lt;ref name="ISO9001"&gt;International Organization for Standardization, "ISO/IEC 9001: Quality management systems -- Requirements," 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; commented by&lt;ref name="ISO24765"&gt;International Organization for Standardization, "ISO/IEC 24765: Systems and software engineering – Vocabulary," 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) while for others it can be synonymous with "customer value" (Highsmith, 2002) or even defect level.

The first definition of quality History remembers is from Shewhart in the beginning of 20th century: ''There are two common aspects of quality: one of them has to do with the consideration of the quality of a thing as an objective reality independent of the existence of man. The other has to do with what we think, feel or sense as a result of the objective reality. In other words, there is a subjective side of quality.'' (Shewhart&lt;ref name="Shewhart1931"&gt;W. A. Shewhart, Economic control of quality of manufactured product. Van Nostrand, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;)

=== Kitchenham, Pfleeger, and Garvin's five perspectives on quality ===
Kitchenham and Pfleeger,&lt;ref name="Kitchenham1996"&gt;B. Kitchenham and S. Pfleeger, "Software quality: the elusive target", Software, IEEE, vol. 13, no. 1, pp. 12–21, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; further reporting the teachings of David Garvin,&lt;ref name="Garvin1988"&gt;D. A. Garvin, Managing Quality - the strategic and competitive edge. New York, NY: Free Press [u.a.], 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; identify five different perspectives on quality:
* The transcendental perspective deals with the metaphysical aspect of quality. In this view of quality, it is "something toward which we strive as an ideal, but may never implement completely".&lt;ref name="Kitchenham1996" /&gt; It can hardly be defined, but is similar to what a federal judge once commented about obscenity: "I know it when I see it".&lt;ref name="Kan2002"&gt;S. H. Kan, "Metrics and Models in Software Quality Engineering", 2nd ed. Boston, MA, USA: Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The user perspective is concerned with the appropriateness of the product for a given context of use. Whereas the transcendental view is ethereal, the user view is more concrete, grounded in the product characteristics that meet user’s needs.&lt;ref name="Kitchenham1996" /&gt;
* The manufacturing perspective represents quality as conformance to requirements. This aspect of quality is stressed by standards such as ISO 9001, which defines quality as "the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements" (ISO/IEC 9001&lt;ref name="ISO9001" /&gt;).
* The product perspective implies that quality can be appreciated by measuring the inherent characteristics of the product.
* The final perspective of quality is value-based. This perspective recognises that the different perspectives of quality may have different importance, or value, to various stakeholders.

=== Software quality according to Deming ===
{{Quote|text=The problem inherent in attempts to define the quality of a product, almost any product, were stated by the master Walter A. Shewhart. The difficulty in defining quality is to translate future needs of the user into measurable characteristics, so that a product can be designed and turned out to give satisfaction at a price that the user will pay. This is not easy, and as soon as one feels fairly successful in the endeavor, he finds that the needs of the consumer have changed, competitors have moved in, etc.&lt;ref name="Deming1988"&gt;W. E. Deming, "Out of the crisis: quality, productivity and competitive position". Cambridge University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;|author=[[W. Edwards Deming]]}}

=== Software quality according to Feigenbaum ===
{{Quote|Quality is a customer determination, not an engineer's determination, not a marketing determination, nor a general management determination. It is based on the customer's actual experience with the product or service, measured against his or her requirements -- stated or unstated, conscious or merely sensed, technically operational or entirely subjective -- and always representing a moving target in a competitive market.&lt;ref name="Feigenbaum"&gt;A. V. Feigenbaum, "Total Quality Control", McGraw-Hill, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Software quality according to Juran ===
{{Quote|The word quality has multiple meanings. Two of these meanings dominate the use of the word: 1. Quality consists of those product features which meet the need of customers and thereby provide product satisfaction. 2. Quality consists of freedom from deficiencies. Nevertheless, in a handbook such as this it is convenient to standardize on a short definition of the word quality as "fitness for use".&lt;ref name="Juran1988"&gt;J.M. Juran, "Juran's Quality Control Handbook", McGraw-Hill, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== CISQ's quality model ===
Even though "quality is a perceptual, conditional and somewhat subjective attribute and may be understood differently by different people" (as noted in the article on [[quality (business)|quality in business]]), software structural quality characteristics have been clearly defined by the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ). Under the guidance of [[Dr Bill Curtis|Bill Curtis]], co-author of the [[Capability Maturity Model]] framework and CISQ's first Director; and [[Capers Jones]], CISQ's Distinguished Advisor, CISQ has defined five major desirable characteristics of a piece of software needed to provide [[business value]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://it-cisq.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CISQ_2009_Executive_Forums_Report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[House of Quality]] model, these are "Whats" that need to be achieved:

; [[Reliability (engineering)|Reliability]]: An attribute of resiliency and structural solidity. Reliability measures the level of risk and the likelihood of potential application failures. It also measures the defects injected due to modifications made to the software (its "stability" as termed by ISO). The goal for checking and monitoring Reliability is to reduce and prevent application downtime, application outages and errors that directly affect users, and enhance the image of IT and its impact on a company's business performance.
; [[Efficiency]]: The source code and software architecture attributes are the elements that ensure high performance once the application is in run-time mode. Efficiency is especially important for applications in high execution speed environments such as algorithmic or transactional processing where performance and scalability are paramount. An analysis of source code efficiency and scalability provides a clear picture of the latent business risks and the harm they can cause to customer satisfaction due to response-time degradation.
; [[Security]]: A measure of the likelihood of potential security breaches due to poor coding practices and architecture. This quantifies the risk of encountering critical vulnerabilities that damage the business.&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Gary (2004), Software security, 11-17&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Maintainability]]: Maintainability includes the notion of adaptability, portability and transferability (from one development team to another). Measuring and monitoring maintainability is a must for mission-critical applications where change is driven by tight time-to-market schedules and where it is important for IT to remain responsive to business-driven changes. It is also essential to keep maintenance costs under control.
; Size: While not a quality attribute per se, the sizing of source code is a software characteristic that obviously impacts maintainability. Combined with the above quality characteristics, software size can be used to assess the amount of work produced and to be done by teams, as well as their productivity through correlation with time-sheet data, and other [[Software development process|SDLC]]-related metrics.

Software functional quality is defined as conformance to explicitly stated functional requirements, identified for example using [[Voice of the Customer]] analysis (part of the [[Design for Six Sigma]] toolkit and/or documented through [[use cases]]) and the level of satisfaction experienced by end-users. The latter is referred as to as [[usability]] and is concerned with how intuitive and responsive the [[user interface]] is, how easily simple and complex operations can be performed, and how useful [[error messages]] are. Typically, software testing practices and tools ensure that a piece of software behaves in compliance with the original design, planned user experience and desired [[Software testability|testability]], i.e. a piece of software's disposition to support acceptance criteria.

The dual structural/functional dimension of software quality is consistent with the model proposed in [[Steve McConnell]]'s [[Code Complete]] which divides software characteristics into two pieces: internal and external quality characteristics. External quality characteristics are those parts of a product that face its users, where internal quality characteristics are those that do not.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell, Steve (1993), Code Complete (First ed.), Microsoft Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative approaches ==

One of the challenges in defining quality is that "everyone feels they understand it"&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, P., ''Quality is Free'', McGraw-Hill, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Quality (business)#Notable definitions|definitions of software quality]] could be based on extending the various descriptions of the concept of quality used in business.

Dr. [[Tom DeMarco]] has proposed that "a product's quality is a function of how much it changes the world for the better."&lt;ref&gt;DeMarco, T., ''Management Can Make Quality (Im)possible'', Cutter IT Summit, Boston, April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This can be interpreted as meaning that functional quality and user satisfaction are more important than structural quality in determining software quality.

Another definition, coined by [[Gerald Weinberg]] in Quality Software Management: Systems Thinking, is "Quality is value to some person." &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Weinberg |first=Gerald M. |year=1992 |title=Quality Software Management: Volume 1, Systems Thinking |publisher=Dorset House Publishing |publication-place=New York, NY |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Weinberg |first=Gerald M. |year=1993 |title=Quality Software Management: Volume 2, First-Order Measurement |publisher=Dorset House Publishing |publication-place=New York, NY |page=108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition stresses that quality is inherently subjective—different people will experience the quality of the same software differently. One strength of this definition is the questions it invites software teams to consider, such as "Who are the people we want to value our software?" and "What will be valuable to them?".

{{Anchor|SoftwareQualityMeasurement}}

== Measurement ==

Although the concepts presented in this section are applicable to both structural and functional software quality, measurement of the latter is essentially performed through testing [see main article: [[Software testing]]].

=== Introduction ===

[[File:SoftwareQualityCharacteristicAttributeRelationship.png|thumb|450px|Upright|Relationship between software desirable characteristics (right) and measurable attributes (left).]]

Software quality measurement is about quantifying to what extent a system or software possesses desirable characteristics. This can be performed through qualitative or quantitative means or a mix of both. In both cases, for each desirable characteristic, there are a set of measurable attributes the existence of which in a piece of software or system tend to be correlated and associated with this characteristic. For example, an attribute associated with portability is the number of target-dependent statements in a program. More precisely, using the [[Quality Function Deployment]] approach, these measurable attributes are the "hows" that need to be enforced to enable the "whats" in the Software Quality definition above.

The structure, classification and terminology of attributes and metrics applicable to software quality management have been derived or extracted from the [[ISO 9126|ISO 9126-3]] and the subsequent ISO/IEC 25000:2005 quality model. The main focus is on internal structural quality. Subcategories have been created to handle specific areas like business application architecture and technical characteristics such as data access and manipulation or the notion of transactions.

The dependence tree between software quality characteristics and their measurable attributes is represented in the diagram on the right, where each of the 5 characteristics that matter for the user (right) or owner of the business system depends on measurable attributes (left):
* Application Architecture Practices
* Coding Practices
* Application Complexity
* Documentation
* Portability
* Technical and Functional Volume

Correlations between programming errors and production defects unveil that basic code errors account for 92% of the total errors in the source code. These numerous code-level issues eventually count for only 10% of the defects in production. Bad software engineering practices at the architecture levels account for only 8% of total defects, but consume over half the effort spent on fixing problems, and lead to 90% of the serious reliability, security, and efficiency issues in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omg.org/CISQ_compliant_IT_Systemsv.4-3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228132152/http://www.omg.org/CISQ_compliant_IT_Systemsv.4-3.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code-based analysis===
Many of the existing software measures count structural elements of the application that result from parsing the source code for such individual instructions (Park, 1992),&lt;ref&gt;Park, R.E. (1992). Software Size Measurement: A Framework for Counting Source Statements. (CMU/SEI-92-TR-020). Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University&lt;/ref&gt; tokens (Halstead, 1977),&lt;ref&gt;Halstead, M.E. (1977). Elements of Software Science. Elsevier North-Holland.&lt;/ref&gt; control structures (McCabe, 1976), and objects (Chidamber &amp; Kemerer, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Chidamber, S. &amp; C. Kemerer. C. (1994). A Metrics Suite for Object Oriented Design. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 20 (6), 476-493&lt;/ref&gt;

Software quality measurement is about quantifying to what extent a system or software rates along these dimensions. The analysis can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative approach or a mix of both to provide an aggregate view [using for example weighted average(s) that reflect relative importance between the factors being measured].

This view of software quality on a linear continuum has to be supplemented by the identification of discrete [[#CriticalProgrammingErrors|Critical Programming Errors]]. These vulnerabilities may not fail a test case, but they are the result of bad practices that under specific circumstances can lead to catastrophic outages, performance degradations, security breaches, corrupted data, and myriad other problems (Nygard, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Nygard, M.T. (2007). Release It! Design and Deploy Production Ready Software. The Pragmatic Programmers.&lt;/ref&gt; that make a given system de facto unsuitable for use regardless of its rating based on aggregated measurements. A well-known example of vulnerability is the [[Common Weakness Enumeration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cwe.mitre.org/|title=CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration|website=cwe.mitre.org|access-date=2016-05-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510002103/http://cwe.mitre.org/|archivedate=2016-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a repository of vulnerabilities in the source code that make applications exposed to security breaches.

The measurement of critical application characteristics involves measuring structural attributes of the application's architecture, coding, and in-line documentation, as displayed in the picture above. Thus, each characteristic is affected by attributes at numerous levels of abstraction in the application and all of which must be included calculating the characteristic's measure if it is to be a valuable predictor of quality outcomes that affect the business. The layered approach to calculating characteristic measures displayed in the figure above was first proposed by Boehm and his colleagues at TRW (Boehm, 1978)&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, B., Brown, J.R., Kaspar, H., Lipow, M., MacLeod, G.J., &amp; Merritt, M.J. (1978). Characteristics of Software Quality. North-Holland.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the approach taken in the ISO 9126 and 25000 series standards. These attributes can be measured from the parsed results of a static analysis of the application source code. Even dynamic characteristics of applications such as reliability and performance efficiency have their causal roots in the static structure of the application.

Structural quality analysis and measurement is performed through the analysis of the [[source code]], the [[Software architecture|architecture]], [[software framework]], [[database schema]] in relationship to principles and standards that together define the conceptual and logical architecture of a system. This is distinct from the basic, local, component-level code analysis typically performed by [[development tool]]s which are mostly concerned with implementation considerations and are crucial during [[debugging]] and [[Software testing|testing]] activities.

=== Reliability ===
The root causes of poor reliability are found in a combination of non-compliance with good architectural and coding practices. This non-compliance can be detected by measuring the static quality attributes of an application. Assessing the static attributes underlying an application's reliability provides an estimate of the level of business risk and the likelihood of potential application failures and defects the application will experience when placed in operation.

Assessing reliability requires checks of at least the following software engineering best practices and technical attributes:

{{Div col}}
* Application Architecture Practices
* Coding Practices
* Complexity of algorithms
* Complexity of programming practices
* Compliance with Object-Oriented and Structured Programming best practices (when applicable)
* Component or pattern re-use ratio
* Dirty programming
* Error &amp; Exception handling (for all layers - GUI, Logic &amp; Data)
* Multi-layer design compliance
* Resource bounds management
* Software avoids patterns that will lead to unexpected behaviors
* Software manages data integrity and consistency
* Transaction complexity level
{{Div col end}}

Depending on the application architecture and the third-party components used (such as external libraries or frameworks), custom checks should be defined along the lines drawn by the above list of best practices to ensure a better assessment of the reliability of the delivered software.

=== Efficiency ===
As with Reliability, the causes of performance inefficiency are often found in violations of good architectural and coding practice which can be detected by measuring the static quality attributes of an application. These static attributes predict potential operational performance bottlenecks and future scalability problems, especially for applications requiring high execution speed for handling complex algorithms or huge volumes of data.

Assessing performance efficiency requires checking at least the following software engineering best practices and technical attributes:
* Application Architecture Practices
* Appropriate interactions with expensive and/or remote resources
* Data access performance and data management
* Memory, network and disk space management
* Coding Practices
* Compliance with Object-Oriented and Structured Programming best practices (as appropriate)
* Compliance with SQL programming best practices

=== Security ===
Most security vulnerabilities result from poor coding and architectural practices such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. These are well documented in lists maintained by CWE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cwe.mitre.org/ |title=CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration |publisher=Cwe.mitre.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014120515/http://cwe.mitre.org/ |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the SEI/Computer Emergency Center [[CERT Coordination Center|(CERT)]] at Carnegie Mellon University.

Assessing security requires at least checking the following software engineering best practices and technical attributes:
* Application Architecture Practices
* Multi-layer design compliance
* Security best practices (Input Validation, SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/top25-programming-errors/ |title=CWE's Top 25 |publisher=Sans.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; )
* Programming Practices (code level)
* Error &amp; Exception handling
* Security best practices (system functions access, access control to programs)

=== Maintainability ===
Maintainability includes concepts of modularity, understandability, changeability, testability, reusability, and transferability from one development team to another. These do not take the form of critical issues at the code level. Rather, poor maintainability is typically the result of thousands of minor violations with best practices in documentation, complexity avoidance strategy, and basic programming practices that make the difference between clean and easy-to-read code vs. unorganized and difficult-to-read code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifsq.org/resources/level-2/booklet.pdf IfSQ Level-2 A Foundation-Level Standard for Computer Program Source Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027000121/http://www.ifsq.org/resources/level-2/booklet.pdf |date=2011-10-27 }}, Second Edition August 2008, Graham Bolton, Stuart Johnston, IfSQ, Institute for Software Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessing maintainability requires checking the following software engineering best practices and technical attributes:
{{Div col}}
* Application Architecture Practices
* Architecture, Programs and Code documentation embedded in source code
* Code readability
* Complexity level of transactions
* Complexity of algorithms
* Complexity of programming practices
* Compliance with Object-Oriented and Structured Programming best practices (when applicable)
* Component or pattern re-use ratio
* Controlled level of dynamic coding
* Coupling ratio
* Dirty programming
* Documentation
* Hardware, OS, middleware, software components and database independence
* Multi-layer design compliance
* Portability
* Programming Practices (code level)
* Reduced [[duplicate code]] and functions
* Source code file organization cleanliness
{{Div col end}}

Maintainability is closely related to Ward Cunningham's concept of [[technical debt]], which is an expression of the costs resulting of a lack of maintainability.
Reasons for why maintainability is low can be classified as reckless vs. prudent and deliberate vs. inadvertent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html|title=TechnicalDebtQuadrant|last1=Fowler|first1=Martin|date=October 14, 2009|accessdate=February 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202111651/http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html|archivedate=February 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often have their origin in developers' inability, lack of time and goals, their carelessness and discrepancies in the creation cost of and benefits from documentation and, in particular, maintainable [[source code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6225956|title=Architectural design and documentation: Waste in agile development?|last1=Prause|first1=Christian|last2=Durdik|first2=Zoya|date=June 3, 2012|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Size ===
Measuring software size requires that the whole source code be correctly gathered, including database structure scripts, data manipulation source code, component headers, configuration files etc. There are essentially two types of software sizes to be measured, the technical size (footprint) and the functional size:

* There are several [[Software Sizing|software technical sizing]] methods that have been widely described. The most common technical sizing method is number of Lines of Code (#LOC) per technology, number of files, functions, classes, tables, etc., from which backfiring Function Points can be computed;
* The most common for measuring functional size is [[function point]] analysis. Function point analysis measures the size of the software deliverable from a user's perspective. Function point sizing is done based on user requirements and provides an accurate representation of both size for the developer/estimator and value (functionality to be delivered) and reflects the business functionality being delivered to the customer. The method includes the identification and weighting of user recognizable inputs, outputs and data stores. The size value is then available for use in conjunction with numerous measures to quantify and to evaluate software delivery and performance (development cost per function point; delivered defects per function point; function points per staff month.).

The function point analysis sizing standard is supported by the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG). It can be applied early in the software development life-cycle and it is not dependent on lines of code like the somewhat inaccurate Backfiring method. The method is technology agnostic and can be used for comparative analysis across organizations and across industries.

Since the inception of Function Point Analysis, several variations have evolved and the family of functional sizing techniques has broadened to include such sizing measures as COSMIC, NESMA, Use Case Points, FP Lite, Early and Quick FPs, and most recently Story Points. However, Function Points has a history of statistical accuracy, and has been used as a common unit of work measurement in numerous application development management (ADM) or outsourcing engagements, serving as the "currency" by which services are delivered and performance is measured.

One common limitation to the Function Point methodology is that it is a manual process and therefore it can be labor-intensive and costly in large scale initiatives such as application development or outsourcing engagements. This negative aspect of applying the methodology may be what motivated industry IT leaders to form the Consortium for IT Software Quality focused on introducing a computable metrics standard for automating the measuring of software size while the IFPUG keep promoting a manual approach as most of its activity rely on FP counters certifications.

CISQ announced the availability of its first metric standard, Automated Function Points,to the CISQ membership, in CISQ Technical. These recommendations have been developed in OMG's Request for Comment format and submitted to OMG's process for standardization.{{Citation needed |date=December 2013 |reason=A link to the AFP document is not appropriate but a third-party link discussing the information here is.}}

=== Identifying critical programming errors ===
{{Anchor|CriticalProgrammingErrors}}  
Critical Programming Errors are specific architectural and/or coding bad practices that result in the highest, immediate or long term, business disruption risk.

These are quite often technology-related and depend heavily on the context, business objectives and risks. Some may consider respect for naming conventions while others – those preparing the ground for a knowledge transfer for example – will consider it as absolutely critical.

Critical Programming Errors can also be classified per CISQ Characteristics. Basic example below: 
* Reliability
** Avoid software patterns that will lead to unexpected behavior ([[Uninitialized variable]], null pointers, etc.)
** Methods, procedures and functions doing Insert, Update, Delete, Create Table or Select must include error management
** Multi-thread functions should be made thread safe, for instance servlets or [[Apache Struts|struts]] action classes must not have instance/non-final static fields
* Efficiency
** Ensure centralization of client requests (incoming and data) to reduce network traffic
** Avoid SQL queries that don't use an index against large tables in a loop
* Security
** Avoid fields in servlet classes that are not final static
** Avoid data access without including error management
** Check control return codes and implement error handling mechanisms
** Ensure input validation to avoid cross-site scripting flaws or SQL injections flaws
* Maintainability
** Deep inheritance trees and nesting should be avoided to improve comprehensibility
** Modules should be loosely coupled (fanout, intermediaries, ) to avoid propagation of modifications
** Enforce homogeneous naming conventions

=== Operationalized quality models ===
Newer proposals for quality models such as [[Squale]] and Quamoco&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Operationalised product quality models and assessment: The Quamoco approach|url = http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/opus/volltexte/2015/9916/pdf/quamoco.pdf|journal = Information and Software Technology|date = 2015|pages = 101–123|volume = 62|doi = 10.1016/j.infsof.2015.02.009|first = Stefan|last = Wagner|first2 = Andreas|last2 = Goeb|first3 = Lars|last3 = Heinemann|first4 = Michael|last4 = Kläs|first5 = Constanza|last5 = Lampasona|first6 = Klaus|last6 = Lochmann|first7 = Alois|last7 = Mayr|first8 = Reinhold|last8 = Plösch|first9 = Andreas|last9 = Seidl}}&lt;/ref&gt; propagate a direct integration of the definition of quality attributes and measurement. By breaking down quality attributes or even defining additional layers, the complex, abstract quality attributes (such as reliability or maintainability) become more manageable and measurable. Those quality models have been applied in industrial contexts but have not received widespread adoption.

'''Suicidal ideation''', also known as '''suicidal thoughts''',&lt;ref name=Gliatto1999&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gliatto |first=MF |last2=Rai |first2=AK |date=March 1999 |title=Evaluation and Treatment of Patients with Suicidal Ideation |journal=[[American Family Physician]] |volume=59 |issue=6 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990315ap/1500.html |accessdate=2007-01-08 |pmid=10193592 |pages=1500–6}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; is thinking about or having an unusual preoccupation with [[suicide]]. The range of suicidal ideation varies greatly from fleeting thoughts, to extensive thoughts, to detailed planning, [[role playing]] (e.g., standing on a chair with a noose), and [[Failed suicide attempt|incomplete attempts]], which may be deliberately constructed not to be completed or discovered, or may be fully intended to result in death, but the individual survives (e.g., in the case of a hanging in which the cord breaks).

Most people who have suicidal thoughts do not go on to make suicide attempts, but suicidal thoughts are considered a risk factor.&lt;ref name=Gliatto1999/&gt; During 2008–09, an estimated 8.3 million adults aged 18 and over in the United States, or 3.7% of the adult U.S. population, reported having suicidal thoughts in the previous year. An estimated 2.2 million in the U.S. reported having made suicide plans in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crosby|first=Alex |last2=Beth |first2=Han |date=October 2011 |title=Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors Among Adults Aged ≥18 Years --- United States, 2008-2009 |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)|volume=60 |issue=13|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6013a1.htm |accessdate=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suicidal ideation is generally associated with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and other [[mood disorder]]s; however, it seems to have associations with many other [[mental disorders]], life events, and family events, all of which may increase the risk of suicidal ideation. For example, many individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]] exhibit recurrent suicidal behavior and suicidal thoughts. One study found that 73% of patients with borderline personality disorder have attempted suicide, with the average patient having 3.4 attempts.&lt;ref name=PS00&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soloff |first=PH |last2=Kevin |first2=GL |last3=Thomas |first3=MK |last4=Kevin |first4=MM |last5=Mann |first5=JJ |title=Characteristics of Suicide Attempts of Patients With Major Depressive Episode and Borderline Personality Disorder: A Comparative Study |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |date=1 April 2000 |volume=157 |issue=4 |pages=601–608 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.4.601 |pmid=10739420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are a number of treatment options for those experiencing suicidal ideation.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:The way out.jpg|thumb|The way out or Suicidal Ideation George Grie (2007)]]
Suicidal ideation has a straightforward definition—suicidal thoughts—but there are some other related signs and symptoms. Some symptoms or [[co-morbid]] conditions may include unintentional weight loss, feeling helpless, feeling alone, excessive fatigue, low self-esteem, presence of consistent [[mania]], excessively talkative, intent on previously dormant goals, feel like one's mind is racing.&lt;ref name= "American Psychiatric Association"&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of symptoms like these with an inability to get rid of or cope with their effects, a possible form of psychological inflexibility, is one possible trait associated with suicidal ideation.&lt;ref name= "Valenstein, et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Valenstein |first=H |last2=Cronkite |first2=RC |last3=Moos |first3=RH |last4=Snipes |first4=C |last5=Timko |first5=C |year=2012 |title=Suicidal ideation in adult offspring of depressed and matched control parents: Childhood and concurrent predictors |journal=Journal of Mental Health |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=459–468 |doi=10.3109/09638237.2012.694504 |pmid=22978501}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also cause psychological distress, which is another symptom associated with suicidal ideation.&lt;ref name="Chamberlain"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chamberlain |first=P |last2=Goldney |first2=R |last3=Delfabbro |first3=P |last4=Gill |first4=T |last5=Dal Grande |first5=L |title=Suicidal Ideation: The Clinical Utility of the K10 |journal=Crisis |year=2009 |volume=30 |series=1 |pages=39–42 |doi=10.1027/0227-5910.30.1.39 |pmid=19261567 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms like these related with psychological inflexibility, recurring patterns, or psychological distress may in some cases lead to the onset of suicidal ideation. Other possible symptoms and warning signs include:

* Hopelessness
* [[Anhedonia]]

==Risk factors==
{{See also|Suicide#Risk factors}}
There are numerous indicators that one can look for when trying to detect suicidal ideation. There are also situations in which the risk for suicidal ideation may be heightened. The risk factors for suicidal ideation can be divided into three categories: psychiatric disorders, life events, and family history.

===Psychiatric disorders===

There are several psychiatric disorders that appear to be comorbid with suicidal ideation or considerably increase the risk of suicidal ideation.&lt;ref name= "Hemelrijk et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hemelrijk |first=E |last2=Van Ballegooijen |first2=W |last3=Donker |first3=T |last4=Van Straten |first4=A |last5=Kerkhof |first5=A |year=2012 |title=Internet-based screening for suicidal ideation in common mental disorders |journal=Crisis: the Journal of Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=215–221 |doi=10.1027/0227-5910/a000142 |pmid=22713975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following list includes the disorders that have been shown to be the strongest predictors of suicidal ideation. It should be noted, however, that these are not the only disorders that can increase risk of suicidal ideation. The disorders in which risk is increased the greatest include:&lt;ref name= "Harris &amp; Barraclough"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=EC |last2=Barraclough |first2=B |year=1997 |title=Suicide as an outcome for mental disorders. A meta analysis |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=170 |issue=3 |pages=205–228 |pmid=9229027 |doi=10.1192/bjp.170.3.205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Anxiety disorders]]
* [[Autism spectrum disorder]]
* [[Major depressive disorder]]
* [[Dysthymia]]
* [[Bipolar disorder]]
* [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD)
* [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] (C-PTSD)
* [[Personality disorders]]
* [[Psychosis]] (detachment from reality)
* [[Paranoia]]
* [[Schizophrenia]]
* [[Substance use disorders]]&lt;ref name= "Lemon TI, Shah R D."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lemon |first=TI |last2=Shah |first2=RD |title=Needle exchanges – a forgotten outpost in suicide and self-harm prevention |journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research |year=2013 |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=551–552 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2013.03.057 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lemon TI"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lemon |first=TI |title=Suicide ideation in drug users and the role of needles exchanges and their workers |journal=Journal Psych Med |year=2013 |volume=6 |issue=5 |doi=10.1016/j.ajp.2013.07.003 |page=429 |pmid=24011693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prescription drug side effects===
Some prescription drugs, such as [[selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), can have suicidal ideation as a side effect.  Moreover, these drugs' intended effects, can themselves have unintended consequence of an increased individual risk and collective rate of suicidal behavior: Among the set of persons taking the medication, a subset feel bad enough to want to attempt suicide (or to desire the perceived results of suicide) but are inhibited by depression-induced symptoms, such as lack of energy and motivation, from following through with an attempt.  Among this subset, a "sub-subset" may find that the medication alleviates their physiological symptoms (such as lack of energy) and secondary psychological symptoms (e.g., lack of motivation) before or at lower doses than it alleviates their primary psychological symptom of depressed mood. Among this group of persons, the desire for suicide or its effects persists even as major obstacles to suicidal action are removed, with the effect that the incidences of suicide attempt and of completed suicide increase.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Life events===

Life events are strong predictors of increased risk for suicidal ideation. Furthermore, life events can also lead to or be comorbid with the previous listed psychiatric disorders and predict suicidal ideation through those means. Life events that adults and children face can be dissimilar and for this reason, the list of events that increase risk can vary in adults and children. The life events that have been shown to increase risk the greatest are&lt;ref name = "Fergusson, Woodward &amp; Horwood"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fergusson |first=DM |last2=Woodward |first2=LJ |last3=Horwood |first3=LJ |year=2000 |title=Risk factors and life processes associated with the onset of suicidal behavior during adolescence and early adulthood |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=23–39 |pmid=10722173 |doi=10.1017/s003329179900135x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Alcohol abuse

===Relationships with parents and friends===
According to a study conducted by Ruth X. Liu of [[San Diego State University]], a significant connection was found between the parent–child relationships of adolescents in early, middle and late [[adolescence]] and their likelihood of suicidal ideation. The study consisted of measuring relationships between mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, mothers and sons, and fathers and daughters. The relationships between fathers and sons during early and middle adolescence show an inverse relationship to suicidal ideation. Closeness with the father in late adolescence is "significantly related to suicidal ideation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=Ruth X. |title=Parent-Youth Closeness and Youth's Suicidal Ideation; The Moderating Effects of Gender, Stages of Adolescence, and Race or Ethnicity |journal=Youth &amp; Society |date=December 2005 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=160–162 |doi=10.1177/0044118X04272290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu goes on to explain the relationship found between closeness with the opposite sex parent and the child's risk of suicidal thoughts. It was found that boys are better protected from suicidal ideation if they are close to their mothers through early and late adolescence; whereas girls are better protected by having a close relationship with their father during middle adolescence.

An article published in 2010 by Zappulla and Pace found that suicidal ideation in adolescent boys is exacerbated by detachment from the parents when depression is already present in the child. Lifetime prevalence estimates of suicidal ideation among nonclinical populations of adolescents generally range from 60%{{clarification needed|date=August 2018}} and in many cases its severity increases the risk of completed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zappulla |first=Carla |title=Relations between suicidal ideation, depression, and emotional autonomy from parents in adolescence |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=3e3be522-4ff3-4d1e-b0ba-703eb8d68714%40sessionmgr12&amp;vid=16&amp;hid=19 |publisher=Springer Science + Business Media LLC |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
{{See also|Suicide prevention}}

Early detection and treatment are the best ways to prevent suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. If signs, symptoms, or risk factors are detected early then the individual might seek treatment and help before attempting to take their own life. In a study of individuals who did commit suicide, 91% of them likely suffered from one or more mental illnesses. However, only 35% of those individuals were treated or being treated for a mental illness.&lt;ref name= "Cavanagh, Owens &amp; Johnstone"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cavanagh |first=JO |last2=Owens |first2=DC |last3=Johnstone |first3=EC |year=1999 |title=Life events in suicide and undetermined death in south-east Scotland: a case-control study using the method of psychological autopsy |journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=645–650 |pmid=10703274 |doi=10.1007/s001270050187}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasizes the importance of early detection; if a mental illness is detected, it can be treated and controlled to help prevent suicide attempts. Another study investigated strictly suicidal ideation in adolescents. This study found that depression symptoms in adolescents early as 9th grade is a predictor of suicidal ideation. Most people with long-term suicidal ideation do not seek professional help.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The previously mentioned studies point out the difficulty that mental health professionals have in motivating individuals to seek and continue treatment. Ways to increase the number of individuals who seek treatment may include:
* Increasing the availability of therapy treatment in early stage
* Increasing the public’s knowledge on when psychiatric help may be beneficial to them
** Those who have adverse life conditions seem to have just as much risk of suicide as those with mental illness&lt;ref name= "Cavanagh, Owens &amp; Johnstone" /&gt;

A study conducted by researchers in Australia set out to determine a course of early detection for suicidal ideation in teens stating that "risks associated with suicidality require an immediate focus on diminishing self-harming cognitions so as to ensure safety before attending to the underlying etiology of the behavior". A Psychological Distress scale known as the K10 was administered monthly to a random sample of individuals. According to the results among the 9.9% of individuals who reported "psychological distress (all categories)" 5.1% of the same participants reported suicidal ideation. Participants who scored "very high" on the Psychological Distress scale "were 77 times more likely to report suicidal ideation than those in the low category".&lt;ref name="Chamberlain" /&gt;

In a one-year study conducted in Finland, 41% of the patients who later committed suicide saw a health care professional, most seeing a psychiatrist. Of those, only 22% discussed suicidal intent on their last office visit. In most of the cases, the office visit took place within a week of the suicide, and most of the victims had a diagnosed depressive disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Halgin |first=Richard P. |author2=Susan Whitbourne  |title=Abnormal psychology: clinical perspectives on psychological disorders |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=Boston |year=2006 |pages=267–272 |isbn=0-07-322872-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many centers where one can receive aid in the fight against suicidal ideation and suicide. Hemelrijk et al. (2012) found evidence that assisting people with suicidal ideation via the internet versus more direct forms such as phone conversations has a greater effect.

==Treatment==

Treatment of suicidal ideation can be problematic due to the fact that several medications have actually been linked to increasing or causing suicidal ideation in patients. Therefore, several alternative means of treating suicidal ideation are often used. The main treatments include: therapy, hospitalization, outpatient treatment, and medication or other modalities.&lt;ref name=Gliatto1999/&gt;

===Therapy===

In [[psychotherapy]] a person explores the issues that make them feel suicidal and learns skills to help manage emotions more effectively.&lt;ref name=Gliatto1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/suicide/basics/treatment/con-20033954&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hospitalization===

Hospitalization allows the patient to be in a secure, supervised environment to prevent the suicidal ideation from turning into suicide attempts. In most cases, individuals have the freedom to choose which treatment they see fit for themselves. However, there are several circumstances in which individuals can be hospitalized involuntarily. These circumstances are:

# If an individual poses danger to self or others
# If an individual is unable to care for oneself
#

Hospitalization may also be treatment option if an individual:

* Has access to lethal means (e.g., a firearm or a stockpile of pills)
* Does not have social support or people to supervise them
* Has a suicide plan
* Has symptoms of a psychiatric disorder (e.g., [[psychosis]], [[mania]], etc.)

===Outpatient treatment===

Outpatient treatment allows individuals to remain at their place of residence and receive treatment when needed or on a scheduled basis. Being at home may improve quality of life for some patients, because they will have access to their books and computer, and be able to come and go freely. Before allowing patients the freedom that comes with outpatient treatment, physicians evaluate several factors of the patient. These factors include the patient's level of social support, impulse control and quality of judgment. After the patient passes the evaluation, they are often asked to consent to a "no-harm contract". This is a contract formulated by the physician and the family of the patient. Within the contract, the patient agrees not to harm themself, to continue their visits with the physician, and to contact the physician in times of need.&lt;ref name=Gliatto1999/&gt; There is some debate as to whether "no-harm" contracts are effective. These patients are then checked on routinely to assure they are maintaining their contract and avoiding dangerous activities (drinking alcohol, driving fast without wearing a seat belt, etc.).

===Medication===

Prescribing medication to treat suicidal ideation can be difficult. One reason for this is that many medications lift patients' energy levels before lifting their mood. This puts them at greater risk of following through with attempting suicide. Additionally, if a person has a comorbid psychiatric disorder, it may be difficult to find a medication that addresses both the psychiatric disorder and suicidal ideation.

Antidepressants may be effective.&lt;ref name=Gliatto1999/&gt; Often, [[SSRIs]] are used instead of [[Tricyclic antidepressant|TCAs]] as the latter typically have greater harm in overdose.&lt;ref name=Gliatto1999/&gt;

Antidepressants have been shown to be a very effective means of treating suicidal ideation. One correlational study compared mortality rates due to suicide to the use of SSRI antidepressants within certain counties. The counties which had higher SSRI use had a significantly lower number of deaths caused by suicide.&lt;ref name= "Simon"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simon |first=GE |year=2006 |title=How can we know whether antidepressants increase suicide risk? |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=11 |pages=1861–1863 |doi=10.1176/APPI.AJP.163.11.1861|pmid=17074930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an experimental study followed depressed patients for one year. During the first six months of that year, the patients were examined for suicidal behavior including suicidal ideation. The patients were then prescribed antidepressants for the six months following the first six observatory months. During the six months of treatment, experimenters found suicide ideation reduced from 47% of patients down to 14% of patients.&lt;ref name= "Mulder"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mulder |first=RT |year=2008 |title=Antidepressant treatment is associated with a reduction in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=118 |issue=12 |pages=116–122 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2008.01179.x |pmid=18384467 |last2=Joyce |first2=P. R. |last3=Frampton |first3=C. M. A. |last4=Luty |first4=S. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it appears from current research that antidepressants have a helpful effect on the reduction of suicidal ideation.

Although research is largely in favor of the use of antidepressants for the treatment of suicidal ideation, in some cases antidepressants are [[Antidepressants and suicide risk|claimed to be the cause of suicidal ideation]]. Upon the start of using antidepressants, many clinicians will note that sometimes the sudden onset of suicidal ideation may accompany treatment. This has caused the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue a warning stating that sometimes the use of antidepressants may actually increase the thoughts of suicidal ideation.&lt;ref name= "Simon" /&gt; Medical studies have found antidepressants help treat cases of suicidal ideation and work especially well with psychological therapy.&lt;ref name= "Zisook, et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zisook |first=S |last2=Lesser |first2=IM |last3=Lebowitz |first3=B |last4=Rush |first4=AJ |last5=Kallenberg |first5=G |last6=Wisniewski |first6=SR |last7=Nierenberg |first7=AA |last8=Fava |first8=M |last9=Luther |first9=JF |last10=Morris |first10=DW |last11=Trivedi |first11=MH |displayauthors=6 |year=2011 |title=Effect of antidepressant medication treatment on suicidal ideation and behavior in a randomized trial: An exploratory report from the Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes Study |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=72 |issue=10 |pages=1322–1332 |doi=10.4088/JCP.10m06724 |pmid=22075098}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] reduces the risk of suicide in people with mood disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cipriani A, Hawgon K, Stockton S |title=Lithium in the prevention of suicide in mood disorders: updated systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=BMJ|date=27 June 2013|volume=346|issue=jun27 4|pages=f3646–f3646|doi=10.1136/bmj.f3646|pmid=23814104|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tentative evidence finds [[clozapine]] in people with schizophrenia reduces the risk of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wagstaff|first1=A|last2=Perry|first2=C|title=Clozapine: in prevention of suicide in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.|journal=CNS Drugs|date=2003|volume=17|issue=4|pages=273–80; discussion 281–3|pmid=12665398|doi=10.2165/00023210-200317040-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suicide in Cameroon''' has increased rapidly in the last 10 years, although health officials faced challenges assembling official statistics because suicide is considered a [[taboo]] in most parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201209110742.html allAfrica.com: Cameroon: World Suicide Rate Increases by 60 Per cent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide trends in Cameroonian society can be measured as a [[developing world]] problem due to socio-cultural and family relationship mechanisms. Although no governmental data is available to the causes of [[suicide]] in Cameroon, depression has been a documented causes in regard to traditional African initiation rights and worries about contracting HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;International encyclopedia of adolescence: A-J, index, Volume 1 p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Cameroonian Law, to commit suicide itself is not illegal, as is reporting on a suicide in the media, however publication of the suicide of a [[Minor (law)|minor]] is an offence. Government treatment of physiological disorders relating to suicide severely lacks funding.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law in Cameroon: Specific Offences  By Carlson Anyangwe p.286&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization]], there were only 2 [[psychiatric hospitals]] and just 115 beds in such hospitals out of a population of 19.9 million. Cameroon does not have a mental health plan, nor does it have a policy as such.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/atlas/profiles/cmr_mh_profile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Health carried out a 9-year study in the [[Guidiguis]] health district between 1999 and 2008, a rural province in the north of the country. The most frequently used suicide method in the region was the ingestion of toxic agricultural chemicals and the suicides main cause were mainly attributed to ongoing chronic illness (31.9%), with sexual and marital conflicts (25.5%), [[witchcraft]] (14.9%), financial problems (8.5%) being the cause in other cases. The study concluded that suicide in rural [[Cameroon]] is not unusual and the capacity of mental health services in rural Cameroon is virtually non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23786446/reload=0;jsessionid=7obdhXfqa97YrbSyimsk.12 Profile of suicide in rural Cameroon: are health systems doing enough? - Abstract - Europe PubMed Central&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[systems science]] and [[systems philosophy]], '''systemics''' is an initiative to study [[system]]s. It is an attempt at developing logical, mathematical, engineering and philosophical paradigms and frameworks in which physical, technological, biological, social, [[cognitive]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] systems can be studied and modeled.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The term "systemics" was coined in the 1970s by [[Mario Bunge]] and others, as an alternative paradigm for research related to [[systems theory|general systems theory]] and systems science.&lt;ref name = "MB 79"&gt;[[Mario Bunge]] (1979).

==Plot==
{{plot|date=May 2011}}
The movie starts off with [[Mametchi]] finishing his new "Transporter Machine". At the same time, Tanpopo goes off to deliver a forgotten item to her mother. Tanpopo and Mametchi are both about to become older siblings. Memetchi and Kuchipatchi arrive at Mametchi's house just in time to see Mametchi try out his invention. Several events result in the aim of the Forwarding Machine to go off course, and Tanpopo is brought to Tamagotchi Planet.

The next day, Tanpopo goes to school to learn with the Tamagotchi children. During science class, an explosion kisses the room into smoke and darkness. Almost everyone is fine, but Mametchi crouches on the floor in fear. Later, Mametchi explains that he has been afraid of the dark ever since he got trapped in a hole one time. He fears he will be an embarrassment to his little sibling. Mametchi built the Transporter Machine to bring himself his own private sun to give him light. Mametchi vows to begin experiments to make a little sun for himself.

One day, Mametchi and Tanpopo stay home. Papamametchi gives Tanpopo a key that will take her back to the time when she was forwarded to Tamagotchi Planet. After several more events, the egg bounds out the window, rolls down the street, and eventually falls into a bundle of balloons that end up caught on the top of One Tower. Soon all of Tamagotchi Planet is watching Mametchi try to save the egg. Mametchi, Tanpopo, and Memetchi are all trying to save Mametchi's younger sibling, and Kuromametchi saves all three of them, using Kuchipatchi as a trampoline.

Soon, the egg hatches into Mametchi's sister, Chamametchi. A montage of events follow, as Chamametchi grows to [[kindergarten]] age, while Mametchi finally succeeds in creating "Mamesunnitchi", a little sun that will follow Mametchi everywhere and always provide him with light. The real Tamagotchi Planet sun, Sunnitchi, witnesses this.
Soon after, the rocket for Tanpopo is complete. Mametchi says he wants Tanpopo to stay for the birthday celebrations for the King, and both Tanpopo and Mametchi's parents agree.

The next morning, it is dark outside. Sunnitchi is nowhere to be found, and thus Tamagotchi Planet has no light. Mametchi and the others find this odd, but go to school anyway. During more preparations, a sneezing sound is heard, and the Tamagotchi Planet inhabitants are violently thrown into the air. It is soon discovered that Tamagotchi Planet caught a cold due to having no heat. Mametchi and Tanpopo overhear Principal Mimizu explaining that Sunnitchi left a goodbye note, apparently because Mametchi created a new sun. Mametchi takes this to mean that the whole situation was his fault.

That night, Mametchi sneaks out of the house with Mamesunnitchi and enters the completed rocket. Suddenly, Tanpopo, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi appear, eager to help. They give Mametchi the manual, and he is able to start up the rocket. Chamametchi sneaks aboard at the last minute, and they are forced to take her with them.

As the passengers enter space, Papamametchi and the other scientists appear suddenly on the video screen and demand that they return. When Mametchi tells Papamametchi about how he is taking responsibility for his mistakes (just like with the egg incident), Papamametchi reluctantly agrees. The scientists had developed medicine for the Tamagotchi Planet, and the pill was mounted on top of the rocket. They have only one medicine capsule, and only one chance of administering it. Before Mametchi can fire the pill, Chamametchi jumps into his lap at the last moment, dislocating the rocket's trajectory. Though it appears they have failed at curing Tamagotchi planet, Tamagotchi World is able to absorb it with its runny nose.

At this point, Mametchi is about to go in search of Sunnitchi, but the rocket is sent spiraling away, and outside of radio contact. Mametchi finally reaches the breaking point and rails against Chamametchi when she asks to talk to Papamametchi and Mamametchi, yelling at her to be quiet, and that she is to blame for always following him around and not listening to him. Tanpopo tells Mametchi he said too much, and takes Chamametchi into another room to comfort her. Mametchi and the others join Tanpopo and Chamametchi for several minutes, where Mametchi and Chamametchi make up, and Tanpopo now knows what's in store for her when her younger sibling is born and is no longer afraid of that responsibility. Suddenly, however, the ship shakes violently, and they return to the command center to find that there are all sorts of objects flying towards them. They suddenly realize that they are drifting towards a black hole, and Mametchi is stricken with fear.

Mametchi attempts to fire the rocket, but the ship can't escape the pull of the black hole. Suddenly, communications with the Tamagotchi Planet are restored. One of the scientists (Professor Mametchi) notices that the black hole is actually a sleeping Blackholetchi. The only way to save the passengers is to wake Blackholetchi up. Mametchi activates the loudspeaker and everyone on the ship screams out, trying and awaken Blackholetchi. A meteoroid slams into the ship and blocks the loudspeaker so that no sound can come out. In desperation, Mametchi and Tanpopo put on spacesuits and try to dislodge the meteoroid. With the meteroid dislodged, Memetchi, Kuchipatchi, and Chamametchi started shouting at Blackholetchi again. Soon, all of the people on Tamagotchi Planet join in. Mametchi is finally able to overcome his fear of the dark, and joins in the call to awaken Blackholetchi.

Chamametchi starts screaming for Blackholetchi to wake up once more, and soon Tamagotchi World himself makes a loud cry. This finally reaches Blackholetchi, who awakes from his slumber. Mametchi is heard calling out from within Blackholetchi, and the universe's largest Tamagotchi apologizes and returns them to the ship. Communications are once again cut off; the inhabitants on Tamagotchi World note that the rocket has used up all of its fuel, and there is no way for the rocket's passengers to return. Mametchi's connection is restored, and the passengers have returned home. Sunnitchi, brought them all back to Tamagotchi Planet. Sunnitchi explains that he just left to go on a hot springs tour.

The celebration for the King's birthday begins, and there is a parade through Tamatown. Halfway through, Papamametchi and Mamametchi find Tanpopo and tell her that Cometchi is about to fly by Tamagotchi World, willing to take Tanpopo back to Earth. Hastily Tanpopo, Mametchi and his family, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi go to the meadow to meet Cometchi. Tanpopo finally opens up the bag that she was supposed to be taking to her mother, and sees it is the dress that she had worn when she was a newborn. Chamametchi cries that she doesn't want Tanpopo to go, and a tearful farewell follows, with the Tamagotchis promising to never forget her.

Tanpopo is back at her desk in her room, at the exact time before she was forwarded to Tamagotchi Planet. She wonders if it was all a dream, until she sees the key she was given. Just then, her mother calls, and Tanpopo tells her she's about to deliver her bag.

== Description ==
[[File:Johann August Ephraim Goeze1.jpg|thumb|199px|[[Johann August Ephraim Goeze]]]]
[[File:Spallanzani.jpg|thumb|199px|[[Lazzaro Spallanzani]]]]
[[Johann August Ephraim Goeze]] originally named the tardigrade ''kleiner Wasserbär'' (''Bärtierchen'' today), meaning "little water bear" in German. The name ''Tardigradum'' means "slow walker" and was given by [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] in 1776.&lt;ref name="Bordenstein-2008"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bordenstein |first=Sarah |title=Tardigrades (Water Bears) |url=http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/tardigrade/index.html |date=17 December 2008 |publisher=[[Carleton College]] |accessdate=2012-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "water bear" comes from the way they walk, reminiscent of a [[bear]]'s [[gait]]. The biggest adults may reach a body length of {{convert|1.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the smallest below 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm. Newly hatched tardigrades may be smaller than 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm.
[[File:Waterbear.jpg|thumbnail|left|SEM image of ''[[Hypsibius dujardini]]'']]

The most convenient place to find tardigrades is on lichens and mosses. Other environments are [[dune]]s, beaches, [[soil]], and [[ocean|marine]] or [[freshwater]] sediments, where they may occur quite frequently (up to 25,000 animals per litre). Tardigrades, in the case of ''Echiniscoides wyethi'',&lt;ref name="AP-20150929"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Researchers discover new tiny organism, name it for Wyeths |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20150929/us--new_microscopic_animal-f2f8286453.html |date=29 September 2015 |publisher=[[AP News]] |accessdate=2015-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; may be found on [[barnacle]]s.&lt;ref name=PBSW&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2988/0006-324X-128.1.103 |title=''Echiniscoides wyethi'', a new marine tardigrade from Maine, U.S.A.

== Anatomy and morphology ==
Tardigrades have barrel-shaped bodies with four pairs of stubby legs. Most range from {{convert|0.3|to|0.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length, although the largest species may reach {{convert|1.2|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The body consists of a head, three body [[Segment (biology)|segments]] each with a pair of legs, and a [[Caudal (anatomical term)#Anterior and posterior|caudal]] segment with a fourth pair of legs. The legs are without [[joint (anatomy)|joints]], while the feet have four to eight claws each. The [[cuticle]] contains [[chitin]] and [[protein]] and is [[ecdysis|moulted]] periodically. The first three pairs of legs are directed downward along the sides, and are the primary means of locomotion, while the fourth pair is directed backward on the last segment of the trunk and is used primarily for grasping the substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1653/0015-4040(2003)086[0134:OWB]2.0.CO;2 |year=2003 |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=134–137 |title=On water bears |journal=Florida Entomologist |last1=Romano |first1=Frank A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tardigrades lack several [[Hox gene]]s and a large intermediate region of the body axis. In insects, this corresponds to the entire thorax and the abdomen. Practically the whole body, except for the last pair of legs, is made up of just the segments that are homologous to the head region in arthropods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)01507-9|title=The Compact Body Plan of Tardigrades Evolved by the Loss of a Large Body Region|first1=Frank W.|last1=Smith|first2=Thomas C.|last2=Boothby|first3=Ilaria|last3=Giovannini|first4=Lorena|last4=Rebecchi|first5=Elizabeth L.|last5=Jockusch|first6=Bob|last6=Goldstein|date=1 January 2016|publisher=|journal=Current Biology|volume=26|issue=2|pages=224–229|accessdate=29 July 2018|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.11.059}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
All adult tardigrades of the same species have the same quantity of cells (see [[eutely]]). Some species have as many as 40,000&amp;nbsp;cells in each adult, while others have far fewer.&lt;ref name="Seki98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinchin, Ian M. (1994) ''The Biology of Tardigrades'', Ashgate Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The body cavity consists of a [[haemocoel]], but the only place where a true [[coelom]] can be found is around the [[gonad]]. No respiratory organs are found, with gas exchange able to occur across the entirety of the body. Some tardigrades have three tubular glands associated with the rectum; these may be excretory organs similar to the [[Malpighian tubule]]s of [[arthropod]]s, although the details remain unclear.&lt;ref name=IZ /&gt; Also [[Nephridium|nephridia]] are absent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://labs.bio.unc.edu/goldstein/SmithGoldstein2017.pdf Segmentation in Tardigrada and diversification of segmental patterns in Panarthropoda]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tubular mouth is armed with [[Stylet (anatomy)|stylets]], which are used to pierce the plant cells, [[algae]], or small invertebrates on which the tardigrades feed, releasing the body fluids or cell contents. The mouth opens into a triradiate, muscular, sucking [[pharynx]]. The stylets are lost when the animal [[Molting|molts]], and a new pair is secreted from a pair of glands that lie on either side of the mouth. The pharynx connects to a short [[esophagus]], and then to an intestine that occupies much of the length of the body, which is the main site of digestion.

== Reproduction ==
[[File:TardigradeEggsInShedCuticle.jpg|thumb|200px|Shed cuticle of female tardigrade, containing eggs.]]
Although some species are [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenic]], both males and females are usually present, each with a single [[gonad]] located above the intestine. Two ducts run from the testes in males, opening through a single pore in front of the anus. In contrast, females have a single duct opening either just above the anus or directly into the rectum, which thus forms a [[cloaca]].&lt;ref name=IZ /&gt;

Tardigrades are [[oviparous]], and fertilization is usually external. Mating occurs during the molt with the eggs being laid inside the shed [[cuticle]] of the female and then covered with sperm. A few species have internal fertilization, with mating occurring before the female fully sheds her cuticle. In most cases, the eggs are left inside the shed cuticle to develop, but some species attach them to nearby substrate.&lt;ref name=IZ /&gt;

The eggs hatch after no more than 14 days, with the young already possessing their full complement of adult [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Growth to the adult size, therefore, occurs by enlargement of the individual cells ([[hypertrophy]]), rather than by cell division. Tardigrades may molt up to 12 times.&lt;ref name=IZ /&gt;

{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
Most tardigrades are [[phytophagous]] (plant eaters) or [[wikt:bacteriophagous|bacteriophagous]] (bacteria eaters), but some are [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] to the extent of eating other smaller species of tardigrades (e.g., ''[[Milnesium tardigradum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Population dynamics of two species of Tardigrada, ''Macrobiotus hufelandii'' (Schultze) and ''Echiniscus (Echiniscus) testudo'' (Doyere), in roof moss from Swansea |first=Clive I. |last=Morgan |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |volume=46 |issue=1 |date=1977 |pages=263–279 |doi=10.2307/3960| publisher=British Ecological Society|jstor=3960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lindahl |first=K. |date=2008-03-15 |title=Tardigrade Facts |url=http://www.iwu.edu/~tardisdp/tardigrade_facts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tardigrades share morphological characteristics with many species that differ largely by class. Biologists have a difficult time finding verification among tardigrade species because of this  relationship. These animals are most closely related to the early evolution of [[arthropod]]s.&lt;ref name=Brent_Nichols_2005&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |title=Tardigrade Evolution and Ecology |last=Brent Nichols |first=Phillip |publisher=University of South Florida |year=2005 |location=Tampa, FL }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tardigrade fossils go as far back as the Cretaceous period in North America. This specific species is considered cosmopolitan and can be located in regions all over the world. The eggs and cysts of tardigrades are so resistant to other dangers that they are carried great distances, on the feet of other animals, to a different location.&lt;ref name="Nelson-CurrentStatus"/&gt;

The lifespan of tardigrades range from 3&amp;ndash;4&amp;nbsp;months for some species, up to 2&amp;nbsp;years for other species, not counting the time they spend in dormant states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/bryophyte-ecology2/5/ |title=Bryophyte Ecology: Volume 2, Bryogological Interaction |last=Glime |first=Janice |publisher= |year=2010 |isbn= |location= |pages= |chapter=Tardigrades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have conducted [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and molecular studies to understand how tardigrades relate to other lineages of ecdysozoan animals. Two plausible placements have been proposed: tardigrades are either most closely related to [[Arthropoda]] ± [[Onychophora]], or to [[nematodes]]. Evidence for the former is a common result of [[Morphology (biology)|morphological studies]]; evidence of the latter is found in some molecular analyses.

The latter hypothesis has been rejected by recent [[microRNA]] and expressed sequence tag analyses.&lt;ref name=Cambell /&gt; Apparently, the grouping of tardigrades with nematodes found in a number of molecular studies is a [[long branch attraction]] artifact. Within the arthropod group (called panarthropoda and comprising onychophora, tardigrades and euarthropoda), three patterns of relationship are possible: tardigrades sister to [[onychophora]] plus arthropods (the [[lobopodia]] hypothesis); onychophora sister to tardigrades plus arthropods (the tactopoda hypothesis); and onychophora sister to tardigrades.&lt;ref name=Telford&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.2243 |jstor=20208544 |pmid=18192181 |pmc=2614232 |title=The evolution of the Ecdysozoa |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=363 |issue=1496 |pages=1529–37 |year=2008 |last1=Telford |first1=Maximilian J. |last2=Bourlat |first2=Sarah J. |last3=Economou |first3=Andrew |last4=Papillon |first4=Daniel |last5=Rota-Stabelli |first5=Omar }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent analyses indicate that the panarthropoda group is monophyletic, and that tardigrades are a sister group of Lobopodia, the lineage consisting of [[arthropod]]s and [[Onychophora]].&lt;ref name=Cambell&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1105499108 |pmid=21896763 |pmc=3179045 |title=MicroRNAs and phylogenomics resolve the relationships of Tardigrada and suggest that velvet worms are the sister group of Arthropoda |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=108 |issue=38 |pages=15920–4 |year=2011 |last1=Campbell |first1=Lahcen I. |last2=Rota-Stabelli |first2=Omar |last3=Edgecombe |first3=Gregory D. |last4=Marchioro |first4=Trevor |last5=Longhorn |first5=Stuart J. |last6=Telford |first6=Maximilian J. |last7=Philippe |first7=Hervé |last8=Rebecchi |first8=Lorena |last9=Peterson |first9=Kevin J. |last10=Pisani |first10=Davide |bibcode=2011PNAS..10815920C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0130 |jstor=4142714 |pmid=15252980 |pmc=1810026 |title=DNA taxonomy of a neglected animal phylum: An unexpected diversity of tardigrades |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=271 |pages=S189–92 |year=2004 |last1=Blaxter |first1=Mark |last2=Elsworth |first2=Ben |last3=Daub |first3=Jennifer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minute sizes of tardigrades and their membranous integuments make their [[fossilization]] both difficult to detect and highly unusual. The only known fossil specimens are those from mid-[[Cambrian]] deposits in [[Siberia]] and a few rare specimens from [[Cretaceous]] [[amber]].&lt;ref name="EotI"&gt;{{cite book |date=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-82149-5 |title=Evolution of the Insects |first1=David A. |last1=Grimaldi |first2=Michael S. |last2=Engel |pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Echiniscus L.png|thumb|left|''[[Echiniscus]]'']]
The Siberian tardigrade fossils differ from living tardigrades in several ways. They have three pairs of legs rather than four, they have a simplified head morphology, and they have no posterior head appendages, but they share with modern tardigrades their columnar cuticle construction.&lt;ref name=Budd2001/&gt; Scientists think they represent a stem group of living tardigrades.&lt;ref name="EotI" /&gt;

Rare specimens in Cretaceous amber have been found in two North American locations. ''Milnesium swolenskyi'', from [[New Jersey]], is the older of the two; its claws and mouthparts are indistinguishable from the living ''M. tardigradum''. The other specimens from amber are from western [[Canada]], some 15–20&amp;nbsp;million years earlier than ''M. swolenskyi''. One of the two specimens from Canada has been given its own genus and family, ''Beorn leggi'', but it bears a strong resemblance to many living specimens in the family [[Hypsibiidae]].&lt;ref name="EotI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/1964/48418 |first=Kenneth W. |last=Cooper|title=The first fossil tardigrade: ''Beorn leggi'', from Cretaceous Amber |journal=Psyche: A Journal of Entomology |date=1964 |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=41–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Aysheaia]]'' from the middle Cambrian [[Burgess shale]] has been proposed as a sister taxon to an arthropod-tardigrade clade.&lt;ref name="ArtRels"&gt;{{cite book|date=2001|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|isbn=0-412-75420-7|title=Arthropod Relationships|first1=Richard A. |last1=Fortey |authorlink = Richard Fortey|first2=Richard H. |last2=Thomas|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tardigrades have been proposed to be among the closest living relatives of the Burgess shale oddity ''[[Opabinia]]''.&lt;ref name="Budd1996"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1996.tb01831.x |title=The morphology of Opabinia regalis and the reconstruction of the arthropod stem-group |journal=Lethaia |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |year=1996 |last1=Budd |first1=Graham E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genomes and genome sequencing ==
Tardigrade [[genomes]] vary in size, from about 75 to 800 megabase pairs of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genomesize.com/search.php?search=type&amp;value=Tardigrades&amp;display=100|title=Genome Size of Tardigrades}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Hypsibius dujardini'' has a compact genome of 100 megabase pairs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yoshida|first1=Yuki|last2=Koutsovoulos|first2=Georgios|last3=Laetsch|first3=Dominik R.|last4=Stevens|first4=Lewis|last5=Kumar|first5=Sujai|last6=Horikawa|first6=Daiki D.|last7=Ishino|first7=Kyoko|last8=Komine|first8=Shiori|last9=Kunieda|first9=Takekazu|last10=Tomita|first10=Masaru|last11=Blaxter|first11=Mark|last12=Arakawa|first12=Kazuharu|last13=Tyler-Smith|first13=Chris|title=Comparative genomics of the tardigrades Hypsibius dujardini and Ramazzottius varieornatus|journal=PLOS Biology|date=27 July 2017|volume=15|issue=7|pages=e2002266|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002266}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a generation time of about two weeks; it can be cultured indefinitely and cryopreserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.09.055 |pmid=17996863 |title=The tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini, a new model for studying the evolution of development |journal=Developmental Biology |volume=312 |issue=2 |pages=545–59 |year=2007 |last1=Gabriel |first1=Willow N |last2=McNuff |first2=Robert |last3=Patel |first3=Sapna K |last4=Gregory |first4=T.

The genome of ''Ramazzottius varieornatus,'' one of the most stress-tolerant species of Tardigrades, was sequenced by a team of researchers from the University of Tokyo in 2015. Analysis revealed less than 1.2% of its genes were the result of [[horizontal gene transfer]]. They also found evidence of a loss of gene pathways that are known to promote damage due to stress. This study also found a high expression of novel Tardigrade-unique proteins, including [[Dsup|Damage suppressor (Dsup)]], which was shown to protect against DNA damage from [[X-ray]] radiation. The same team applied the Dsup protein to human cultured cells and found that it suppressed X-ray damage to the human cells by ≈40%.&lt;ref name="Hashimoto et al. 2015"/&gt;

== Ecological importance ==
Many organisms that live in aquatic environments feed on species such as nematodes, tardigrades, bacteria, algae, mites, and [[collembolan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kinchin |first=IM |date=1987 |title=The moss fauna 1; Tardigrades. |url=|journal=Journal of Biological Education |volume=21(4) |pages=288–290}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tardigrades work as pioneer species by inhabiting new developing environments. This movement attracts other invertebrates to populate that space, while also attracting predators.&lt;ref name=Brent_Nichols_2005/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The 2014 science documentary show ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'' has featured tardigrades multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2014/06/14/13_ways_neil_degrasse_tysons_cosmos_sent_the_religious_right_off_the_deep_end_partner/|title=13 ways Neil deGrasse Tyson’s "Cosmos" sent the religious right off the deep end|date=14 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23598">'''Tend-and-befriend''' is a behavior exhibited by some animals, including humans, in response to threat. It refers to protection of [[offspring]] (tending) and seeking out the [[social group]] for mutual defense (befriending). In [[evolutionary psychology]], tend-and-befriend is theorized as having evolved as the typical female response to stress, just as the primary male response was [[fight-or-flight]]. The tend-and-befriend theoretical model was originally developed by Dr. [[Shelley E. Taylor]] and her research team at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and first described in a ''[[Psychological Review]]'' article published in the year 2000.&lt;ref name="Taylor et al 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.107.3.411 |title=Biobehavioral responses to stress in females: Tend-and-befriend, not fight-or-flight |year=2000 |last1=Taylor |first1=Shelley E. |last2=Klein |first2=Laura Cousino |last3=Lewis |first3=Brian P. |last4=Gruenewald |first4=Tara L. |last5=Gurung |first5=Regan A. R. |last6=Updegraff |first6=John A. |journal=Psychological Review |volume=107 |issue=3 |pages=411–29 |pmid=10941275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological bases==
According to the [[Polyvagal Theory]] developed by Dr. [[Stephen Porges]], the "Social Nervous System" is an affiliative neurocircuitry that prompts affiliation, particularly in response to stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Porges|first1=S. W.|title=The Polyvagal Theory: Phylogenetic substrates of a social nervous system|journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology|date=2001|volume=42|pages=123–146|doi=10.1016/s0167-8760(01)00162-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system regulates social approach behavior. A biological basis for this regulation appears to be oxytocin.&lt;ref name="Carter99"&gt;Carter, C.S., Lederhendler, I.I., &amp; Kirkpatrick, B., eds. (1999). ''The integrative neurobiology of affiliation''. Cambridge, Mass.: [[MIT Press]].{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxytocin]] has been tied to a broad array of [[social relationships]] and activities, including [[peer group|peer]] bonding, [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], and affiliative preferences.&lt;ref name="Carter99"/&gt; Oxytocin is released in humans in response to a broad array of stressors, especially those that may trigger affiliative needs. Oxytocin promotes affiliative behavior, including maternal tending and social contact with peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Thomas R. |last1=Insel |title=A Neurobiological Basis of Social Attachment |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |pmid=9167498 |year=1997 |volume=154 |issue=6 |pages=726–35 |doi=10.1176/ajp.154.6.726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, affiliation under stress serves tending needs, including protective responses towards offspring. Affiliation may also take the form of befriending, namely seeking social contact for one's own protection, the protection of offspring, and the protection of the social group. These social responses to threat reduce biological stress responses, including lowering heart rate, [[blood pressure]], and [[hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis]] (HPA) stress activity, such as [[cortisol]] responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.19.6.560 |title=Oxytocin responsivity in mothers of infants: A preliminary study of relationships with blood pressure during laboratory stress and normal ambulatory activity |year=2000 |last1=Light |first1=Kathleen C. |last2=Smith |first2=Tara E. |last3=Johns |first3=Josephine M. |last4=Brownley |first4=Kimberly A. |last5=Hofheimer |first5=Julie A. |last6=Amico |first6=Janet A. |journal=Health Psychology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=560–7 |pmid=11129359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are more likely to respond to stress through tending and befriending than men. Paralleling this behavioral sex difference, [[estrogen]] enhances the effects of [[oxytocin]], whereas [[androgens]] inhibit oxytocin release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8713972 |year=1995 |last1=McCarthy |first1=MM |title=Estrogen modulation of oxytocin and its relation to behavior |volume=395 |pages=235–45 |journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tending under stress==
Female stress responses that increased offspring survival would have led to higher fitness and thus were more likely to be passed on through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Taylor et al 2000" /&gt; In the presence of threats, protecting and calming offspring while blending into the environment may have increased chances of survival for mother and child. When faced with stress, females often respond by tending to offspring, which in turn reduces stress levels. Studies conducted by Repetti (1989) show that women respond to highly stressful workdays by providing more nurturing behaviors towards their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Repetti|first1=R. L.|title=Effects of daily workload on subsequent behavior during marital interactions: The role of social withdrawal and spouse support|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989|volume=57|pages=651–659|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.4.651}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, fathers who experienced stressful workdays were more likely to withdraw from their families or were more interpersonally conflictual that evening at home. Furthermore, physical contact between mothers and their offspring following a threatening event decreased HPA activity and sympathetic nervous system arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunnar|first1=M. R.|last2=Gonzales|first2=C. A.|last3=Goodlin|first3=B. L.|last4=Levine|first4=S.|title=Behavioral and pituitary-adrenal responses during a prolonged separation period in rhesus monkeys|journal=Psychoneuroimmunology|date=1981|volume=6|pages=65–75|doi=10.1016/0306-4530(81)90049-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxytocin, released in response to stressors, may be the mechanism underlying the female caregiving response. Studies of [[Sheep|ewes]] show that administration of oxytocin promoted maternal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kendrick|first1=K. M.|last2=Keverne|first2=E. B.|last3=Baldwin|first3=B. A.|title=Intracerebroventricular oxytocin stimulates maternal behaviour in the sheep|journal=Neuroendocrinology|date=1987|volume=46|pages=56–61|doi=10.1159/000124796}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breastfeeding in humans, which is associated with maternal oxytocin release, is physiologically calming to both mothers and infants.&lt;ref name="Taylor et al 2000" /&gt;

===Cooperative breeding===
Tend-and-befriend is a critical, adaptive strategy that would have enhanced [[reproductive success]] among female [[cooperative breeders]]. Cooperative breeders are group-living animals where infant and juvenile care from non-mother helpers are essential to offspring survival.&lt;ref name="burkart-et-al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burkart|first1=J. M.|last2=Hrdy|first2=S. B.|last3=Van Schaik|first3=C. P.|title=Cooperative breeding and human cognitive evolution|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|date=September 2009|volume=18|issue=5|pages=175–186|doi=10.1002/evan.20222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperative breeders include wolves, elephants, many nonhuman primates, and humans. Among all primates and most mammals, endocrinological and neural processes lead females to nurture infants, including unrelated infants, after being exposed long enough to infant signals.&lt;ref name="mothers-and-others"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hrdy|first1=S. B.|title=Mothers and Others|journal=Natural History Magazine|url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-mother female wolves and wild dogs sometimes begin lactating to nurse the alpha female's pups.

Humans are born helpless and [[altricial]], mature slowly, and depend on parental investment well into their young adult lives, and often even later.&lt;ref name="mothers-and-others" /&gt; Humans have spent most of human evolution as [[hunter-gatherer]] [[foragers]]. Among foraging societies without modern birth control methods, women have high parity, tending to give birth about every four years during their reproductive lifespan.&lt;ref name="mothers-and-others" /&gt; When mothers give birth, they often have multiple dependent children in their care, who rely on adults for food and shelter for eighteen or more years. Such a [[reproductive strategy]] would not have been able to evolve if women did not have help from others. Allomothers (helpers who are not a child's mother) protect, provision, carry, and care for children.&lt;ref name="mothers-and-others" /&gt; Allomothers are usually a child's aunts, uncles, fathers, grandmothers, siblings, and other women in the community. Even in modern Western societies, parents often rely on family members, friends, and babysitters to help care for children. Burkart, Hrdy, and Van Schaik (2009) argue that cooperative breeding in humans may have led to the evolution of psychological adaptations for greater prosociality, enhanced social cognition, and cognitive abilities for cooperative purposes, including willingness to share mental states and shared intentionality.&lt;ref name="burkart-et-al" /&gt; These cognitive, prosocial processes brought on by cooperative breeding may have led to the emergence of culture and language.

==Befriending under stress==
Group living provides numerous benefits, including protection from predators and cooperation to achieve shared goals and access to resources. Women create, maintain, and use social networks—especially friendships with other women—to manage stressful conditions.&lt;ref name="Taylor et al 2000" /&gt; During threatening situations, group members can be a source of support and protection for women and their children. Research shows that women are more likely to seek the company of others in times of stress, compared to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0601_1 |title=Sex Differences in Coping Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Review and an Examination of Relative Coping |year=2002 |last1=Tamres |first1=Lisa K. |last2=Janicki |first2=Denise |last3=Helgeson |first3=Vicki S. |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |volume=6 |pages=2–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women and adolescent girls report more sources of social support and are more likely to turn to same-sex peers for support than men or boys are. Cross-culturally, women and girls tend to provide more frequent and effective support than men do, and they are more likely to seek help and support from other female friends and family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whiting|first1=B.|last2=Whiting|first2=J.|title=Children of six cultures|date=1975|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women tend to affiliate with other women under stressful situations. However, when women were given a choice to either wait alone or to affiliate with an unfamiliar man before a stressful laboratory challenge, they chose to wait alone.&lt;ref name="Taylor et al 2000" /&gt; Female-female social networks can provide assistance for childcare, exchange of resources, and protection from predators, other threats, and other group members. Smuts (1992) and Taylor et al. (2000) argue that female social groups also provide protection from male aggression.&lt;ref name="Taylor et al 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smuts|first1=B.|title=Male aggression against women: An evolutionary perspective|journal=Human Nature|date=1992|volume=3|pages=1–44|doi=10.1007/bf02692265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroendocrine underpinnings===
Human and animal studies (reviewed in Taylor et al., 2000) suggest that oxytocin is the [[neuroendocrine]] mechanism underlying the female "befriend" [[stress response]].&lt;ref name="Taylor et al 2000" /&gt; Oxytocin administration to rats and prairie voles increased social contact and social grooming behaviors, reduced stress, and lowered aggression. In humans, oxytocin promotes mother-infant attachments, romantic pair bonds, and friendships. Social contact or support during stressful times leads to lowered sympathetic and neuroendocrine stress responses. Although social support downregulates these physiological stress responses in both men and women, women are more likely to seek social contact during stress. Furthermore, support from another female provides enhanced stress-reducing benefits to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerin|first1=W.|last2=Milner|first2=D.|last3=Chawla|first3=S.|title=Social support as a moderator of cardiovascular reactivity: A test of the direct effects and buffering hypothesis|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=57|pages=16–22|doi=10.1097/00006842-199501000-00003|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a review of female aggression noted that "The fact that OT [oxytocin] enhances, rather than diminishes, attention to potential threat in the environment casts doubt on the popular ‘tend-and-befriend’ hypothesis which is based on the presumed anxiolytic effect of OT".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The evolutionary psychology of women's aggression|journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|last=Campbell|first=Anne|doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0078|date=December 5, 2013|volume=368|issue=1631|page=20130078|pmid=24167308|pmc=3826207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of affiliation under stress===
According to Taylor (2000), affiliative behaviors and tending activities reduce biological stress responses in both parents and offspring, thereby reducing stress-related health threats.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E. (2002). ''The tending instinct: How nurturing is essential to who we are and how we live''. New York: [[Henry Holt and Company|Holt]].{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Befriending" may lead to substantial mental and physical health benefits in times of stress. [[Social isolation]] is associated with significantly enhanced risk of mortality, whereas social support is tied to positive health outcomes, including reduced risk of illness and death.&lt;ref name="Cohen85"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310 |title=Stress, social support, and the buffering hypothesis |year=1985 |last1=Cohen |first1=Sheldon |last2=Wills |first2=Thomas A. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=310–57 |pmid=3901065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have higher [[List of countries by life expectancy|life expectancies]] from birth in most countries where there is equal access to medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Life expectancy data by country|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688?lang=en|website=WHO|accessdate=1 June 2013|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for example, this difference is almost 6 years. One hypothesis is that men's responses to stress (which include aggression, social withdrawal, and substance abuse) place them at risk for adverse health-related consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lois M. |last1=Verbrugge |title=Gender and Health: An Update on Hypotheses and Evidence |journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior |jstor=2136750 |pmid=3905939 |year=1985 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=156–82 |doi=10.2307/2136750}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, women's responses to stress, which include turning to social sources for support, may be protective to health.

===Competition for resources===

Group living and affiliation with multiple unrelated others of the same sex (who do not share genetic interests) also presents the problem of competing for access to limited resources, such as social status, food, and mates. Interpersonal stress is the most common and distressing type of stress for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=M. C.|last2=Matthews|first2=K. A.|last3=Twamley|first3=E. W.|title=Is life more difficult on Mars or Venus? A meta-analytic review of sex differences in major and minor life events|journal=Annals of Behavioral Medicine|date=1999|volume=21|pages=83–97|doi=10.1007/bf02895038|pmid=18425659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the befriending stress response may be especially activated for women under conditions of resource scarcity,&lt;ref name="Taylor et al 2000" /&gt; resource scarcity also entails more intense competition for these resources. In environments with a female-biased sex ratio, where males are a more limited resource, female-to-female competition for mates is intensified, sometimes even resorting to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=A.|title=A few good men: Evolutionary psychology and female adolescent aggression|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|date=1995|volume=16|pages=99–123|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(94)00072-f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although male crime rates far exceed those of females, arrests for assault among females follow a similar age distribution as in males, peaking for females in the late teens to mid-twenties. Those are ages in which females are at peak reproductive potential and experience the most mating competition. However, the benefits of affiliation would have outweighed the costs in order for tend-and-befriend to have evolved.

====Competition and aggression====
Rates of aggression between human males and females may not differ, but the patterns of aggression between the sexes do differ. Although females in general are less physically aggressive, they tend to engage in as much or even more indirect aggression (e.g. social exclusion, gossip, rumors, denigration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bjorkqvist|editor1-first=K.|editor2-last=Niemela|editor2-first=P.|title=Of mice and women: Aspects of female aggression|date=1992|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When experimentally primed with a mating motive or status competition motive, men were more willing to become directly aggressive towards another man, whereas women were more likely to indirectly aggress against another woman in an aggression-provoking situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griskevicius|first1=Vladas|title=Aggress to Impress: Hostility as an Evolved Context-Dependent Strategy|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2009|volume=96|issue=5|pages=980–994|doi=10.1037/a0013907|display-authors=etal|pmid=19379031}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, experimentally priming people with a resource competition motive increased direct aggression in both men and women. Consistent with this result, rates of violence and crime are higher among males and females under conditions of resource scarcity.&lt;ref name="staying-alive"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=A.|title=Staying alive: Evolution, culture, and women’s intrasexual aggression|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=1999|volume=22|pages=203–252|doi=10.1017/s0140525x99001818|pmid=11301523}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, resource competition did not increase direct aggression in either men or women when they were asked to imagine that were married and had a young child. The costs of physical injury to a parent would also entail costs to his or her family.

Lower [[variance]] in [[reproductive success]] and higher costs of physical aggression may explain the lower rates of physical aggression among human females compared to males.&lt;ref name="staying-alive" /&gt; Females are in general more likely to produce offspring in their lifetimes than males. Therefore, they have less to gain from fighting and the risk of injury or death would produce greater [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] cost for females. The survival of young children depended more on [[maternal]] than [[paternal care]], which underscores the importance of maternal safety, survival, and risk aversion.&lt;ref name="staying-alive" /&gt; Infants' primary attachment is to their mother, and maternal death increased the chances of childhood mortality in foraging societies by fivefold, compared to threefold in the cases of paternal death.&lt;ref name="staying-alive" /&gt; Therefore, women respond to threats by tending and befriending, and female aggression is often indirect and covert in nature to avoid retaliation and physical injury.

=====Informational warfare=====
Women befriend others not only for protection, but also to form [[alliance]]s to compete with [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] members for resources, such as food, mates, and social and cultural resources (e.g. status, social positions, rights and responsibilities). Informational warfare is the strategic competitive tactics taking the form of indirect, verbal aggression directed towards rivals.&lt;ref name="hess-hagen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hess|first1=Nicole|last2=Hagen|first2=Edward|title=Informational warfare: Coalitional gossiping as a strategy for within-group aggression|journal=Cogprints|date=2002|url=http://cogprints.org/2112/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gossip]] is one such tactic, functioning to spread information that would damage the reputation of a competitor. There are several theories regarding gossip, including social bonding and group cohesion. However, consistent with informational warfare theory, the content of gossip is relevant to the context in which competition is occurring. For example, when competing for a work promotion, people were more likely to spread negative work-related information about a competitor to coworkers.&lt;ref name="hess-hagen" /&gt; Negative gossip also increases with resource scarcity and higher resource value. In addition, people are more likely to spread negative information about potential rivals but more likely to pass on positive information about family members and friends.

As mentioned above, befriending can serve to protect women from threats, including harm from other people. Such threats are not limited to physical harm but also include reputational damage. Women form friendships and alliances in part to compete for limited resources, and also in part to protect themselves from relational and reputational harm. The presence of friends and allies can help deter malicious gossip, due to an alliance's greater ability to retaliate, compared to a single individual's ability. Studies by Hess and Hagen (2009) show that the presence of a competitor's friend reduced people's tendencies to gossip about the competitor.&lt;ref name="hess-hagen" /&gt; This effect was stronger when the friend was from the same competitive social environment (e.g. same workplace) than when the friend was from a nonrelevant social environment. Friends increase women's perceived capabilities for inflicting reputational harm on a rival as well as perceptions of defensive capabilities against indirect aggression.

The '''''Walking with...''''' series (also known as the '''''Trilogy of Life''''' or '''''Walking with Prehistoric Life''''' series) is a collection of shows that are produced by the [[BBC]] and are made by [[Impossible Pictures]]. The aim of the series and specials, along with its books, is to recreate extinct animals and presents them as a wildlife documentary. All the shows (with the exception of ''[[Chased by Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Sea Monsters (TV series)|Sea Monsters]]'' and ''[[Prehistoric Park]]'') focus on one individual of a certain species or that species as the main characters in each episode. Creatures were realized through [[computer graphics]] and [[animatronics]] and are directed by [[Tim Haines]]. The concept for the series was imagined by [[Tim Haines]] and [[Jasper James]].
