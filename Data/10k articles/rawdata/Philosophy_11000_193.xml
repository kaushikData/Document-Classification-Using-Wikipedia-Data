      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4227">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''A posteriori'' necessity}}
'''''A posteriori'' necessity''' is a thesis in [[metaphysics]] and the [[philosophy of language]], that some statements of which we must acquire knowledge [[a posteriori]] are also [[necessarily true]].  It challenges previously widespread belief that only [[A priori knowledge|''a priori'' knowledge]] can be necessary. It draws on a number of philosophical concepts such as necessity, the [[causal theory of reference]], [[Rigid designator|rigidity]], and the a priori a posteriori distinction.

It was first introduced by philosopher [[Saul Kripke]] in his 1970 series of lectures at Princeton University.  The transcript of these lectures was then compiled and assembled into his seminal book, ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kripke|first=Saul A.|title=Naming and Necessity|year=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main argument for a posteriori necessity ==
{{see|Necessity of identity}}
Here is an overview of the argument:

:(P1) 'Hesperus' is a proper name that refers to the evening star. 'Phosphorus' is also a proper name and it refers to the morning star. But the evening star and the morning star are the same planetary body (Venus). So both names designate Venus

:(P2) If both names designate rigidly, they designate the same object (Venus) in every possible world. Therefore (by the definition of 'necessary') 'Hesperus = Phosphorus' is necessarily true. If it is the case that in all possible worlds the identity claim “Hesperus is Phosphorus” is true, the statement is necessary

:(P3) The fact that Hesperus is Phosphorus was discovered by empirical observation.  So it is a posteriori knowledge. Knowing that Hesperus is Phosphorus cannot have been discovered a priori. Using scientific instruments and empirical research, it was concluded that both Hesperus and Phosphorus are the same object. This is a posteriori knowledge.

:(C)  Therefore, it is possible for knowledge obtained a posteriori  to be necessary. That Hesperus is Phosphorus has been shown to be both necessary, because the names pick out the same thing in all possible worlds, and a posteriori, because this claim was discovered by empirical research.

Other instances of a posteriori necessary truths include: "H2O is water".

== Significance ==

Naming and necessity is among the most important philosophical works of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LaPorte|first=Joseph|title=Rigid Designators|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/rigid-designators/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=24 October 2006|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prospect of a posteriori necessity also makes the distinction between a prioricity, analyticity, and necessity harder to discern because they were previously thought to be largely separated from the a posteriori, the synthetic, and the contingent. With the example “Hesperus is Phosphorus”, Kripke seems to have provided a successful counter-example to the [[Kantian]] claims:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vaidya|first=Anand|title=The Epistemology of Modality|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/modality-epistemology/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=5 December 2007|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(a) ''P'' is a priori iff ''P'' is necessary.

(b) ''P'' is a posteriori iff ''P'' is [[contingent]].

[[Hilary Putnam]] comments on the significance of Kripke’s counter-examples, 
"Since Kant there has been a big split between philosophers who thought that all necessary truths were analytic and philosophers who thought that some necessary truths were synthetic a priori. But none of these philosophers thought that a (metaphysically) necessary truth could fail to be a priori.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Hilary|title=The Meaning of 'Meaning'|journal=Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science|year=1975|volume=7|pages=131–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Actancy''' ({{lang-fr|l'actance}}) is a term in [[syntax]] and [[grammar]] describing the relationship between a [[verb]] [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] and its nominal arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazard|first=Gilbert|title=Actancy|year=1998|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=3-11-015670-9|pages=xi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvEbY0BvGtIC&amp;dq=actancy&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to study and describe ''actants'' or clausal components which identify the nominal participants in a verbal process which may be the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[direct object]], or the [[indirect object]] of the verb. ''Actants'' is a [[French language|French]] term coined by [[Lucien Tesnière]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=P.H.|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Linguistics with Chinese Translation|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press and Shanghai Foreign Language Education Press|location=Shanghai|isbn=7-5446-0179-X|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so its usage has been extended into [[English language|English]] although its usage is more common in continental [[linguistics]] than in English language linguistics. In French, the term ''l'actance'' has the more general meaning of the study of verb arguments and is not as narrow as the English loan.

'''Advice''' (also called '''exhortation''') is a form of relating personal or institutional [[opinion]]s, [[belief systems]], values, recommendations or guidance about certain situations relayed in some context to another person, group or party often offered as a guide to action and/or conduct. Put a little more simply, an advice message is a recommendation about what might be thought, said, or otherwise done to address a problem, make a decision, or manage a situation.

==Kinds of advice==
Advice is believed to be theoretical, and is often considered [[taboo]] as well as helpful. The kinds of advice can range from systems of [[Education|instructional]] and practical toward more [[esoteric]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]], and is often attributable toward problem solving, strategy seeking, and solution finding, either from a social standpoint or a personal one. Advice may pertain to [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], lifestyle changes, legal choices, business goals, personal goals, career goals, [[education]] goals, [[religious]] beliefs, personal growth, [[motivation]], inspiration and so on. Advice is not pertinent to any solid criteria, and may be given freely, or only given when asked upon. In some cultures advice is socially unacceptable to be released unless requested. In other cultures advice is given more openly. It may, especially if it is expert advice such as legal advice or methodological advice also be given only in exchange for payment.

Many expressions and quotations have been used to describe the status of advice, whether given, or received. One such expression is "Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn't." ([[Erica Jong]], How to Save Your Own Life, 1977). Advice is like water, you drink it to replenish your soul. This particular quotation pertains the belief system that states that the answers to one's questions are within themselves, and do not come from any external stimuli. The accuracy of this particular belief is often disputed among theologians, philosophers, etc. However, a person who would hold such a belief, would "advise" another person to seek the answers out from within one's own esoteric and inner spiritual natures.

Advice when adhered to and followed may be beneficial, non-beneficial, damaging, non-damaging, partially beneficial and partially damaging, in reference to personal or social paradigms. In other words, not all advice is either "all good" or "all bad". Many people consider unrequested advice to be paternalistic and patronizing and are thus offended.

Therefore, some people may come to the conclusion that advice is morally better to be left out of the equation altogether, and this theory is included within the following quote (author unknown): "The best advice is this: Don't take advice and don't give advice." Yet, often in society advice has been helpful. A more day to day example would be "eat your vegetables" or "don't drink and drive." If this advice is adhered to we can see that the benefits would outweigh the consequences.

Grammatically speaking, advice is an uncountable noun, like rice or milk. Clicheing or using a cliche, refers to mainstream advice that is overused.&lt;ref&gt;Constant, David, Lee Sproull, and Sara Kiesler. "The kindness of strangers: The usefulness of electronic weak ties for technical advice." Organization science 7.2 (1996): 119-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advice-giving and advice-taking in the social sciences==

===Background information===

Advice-taking and advice-giving are of interest to researchers in the disciplines of [[psychology]], [[economics]], judgment and [[decision-making]], [[organizational behavior]] and [[human resources]], and [[human communication]], among others.&lt;ref name="organizational2006"&gt;Bonaccio, S., &amp; Dalal, R. S.  (2006). Advice taking and decision-making: An integrative literature review, and implications for the organizational sciences. ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 101,'' 127-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychology, seminal articles include Brehmer and Hagafors (1986), Hollenbeck et al. (1995), and Sniezek and Buckley (1995).&lt;ref&gt;Brehmer, B., &amp; Hagafors, R. (1986). The use of experts in complex decision-making: a paradigm for the study of staff work. ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 38,'' 181–195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hollenbeck, J. R., Ilgen, D. R., Sego, D. J., Hedlund, J., Major, D. A., &amp; Phillips, J. (1995). Multilevel theory of team decision making: decision performance in teams incorporating distributed expertise. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 80,'' 292–316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sniezek, J. A., &amp; Buckley, T. (1995). Cueing and cognitive conflict in judge–advisor decision making. ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 62,'' 159–174.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sniezek and Buckley (1995) and Hollenbeck et al. (1995) articles, in particular, introduced researchers to standardized ways of studying advice in the [[laboratory]].&lt;ref name="organizational2006"/&gt; The psychological literature on advice-giving and advice-taking was [[Literature review|reviewed]] by Bonaccio and Dalal (2006), and a portion of this literature was also reviewed by Humphrey et al. (2002).&lt;ref name="organizational2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, S. E., Hollenbeck, J. R., Meyer, C. J., &amp; Ilgen, D. R.(2002). Hierarchical team decision making. In G. R. Ferris &amp; J. J. Martocchio (Eds.). ''Research in personnel and human resources management'' (Vol. 21, pp. 175–213). Stamford, CT: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication researchers have tended to study advice as part of their research on supportive communication.&lt;ref&gt;Burleson, B. R., &amp; MacGeorge, E. L. (2002). Supportive communication. In M. L. Knapp &amp; J. A. Daly (Eds.), ''Handbook of interpersonal communication'' (3rd ed., pp. 374-424). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacGeorge, E. L., Feng, B., &amp; Thompson, E. R. (2008). "Good" and "bad" advice: How to advise more effectively. In M. T. Motley (Ed.), ''Studies in applied interpersonal communication'' (pp. 145-164). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Much research has focused on [[Sex differences in humans|gender differences]] (and similarities) in the provision and receipt of supportive communication.&lt;ref&gt;MacGeorge, E. L., Graves, A. R., Feng, B., Gillihan, S. J., &amp; Burleson, B. R. (2004). The myth of gender cultures: Similarities outweigh differences in men’s and women’s provision of and responses to supportive communication. ''Sex Roles, 50,'' 144-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics, the willingness of entrepreneurs to take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e., entrepreneurial ''coachability'') has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|date=1986-03-01|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0883902686900121|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161–176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, some economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because the entrepreneurs themselves possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of advice-taking are ''not'' actually predictive of subsequent entrepreneurial success (e.g., measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots, and firm survival).

===Social science definitions of "advice"===

In the social sciences in general, and in psychological research in particular, advice has typically been defined as a recommendation to do something.&lt;ref name="organizational2006"/&gt; For example, in response to a client's question regarding whether to invest in stocks, bonds, or T-notes, a financial planner (the advisor) might say: "I recommend going with bonds at this time." However, Dalal and Bonaccio (2010) have argued, based on a review of the research literature, that such a definition is incomplete and leaves out several important types of advice&lt;ref name="organizational1"&gt;Dalal, R. S., &amp; Bonaccio, S. (2010). What types of advice do decision-makers prefer? ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 112,'' 11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sapients.net/article/howtogiveafriendadvice/ |title=Difficult Times – How to give a friend Advice |publisher=Sapients.net |date=2011-07-25 |accessdate=2012-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321200947/http://www.sapients.net/article/howtogiveafriendadvice/ |archivedate=2012-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors have provided the following taxonomy of advice:
* Recommending a particular course of action (this is the usual form of advice that is studied)
* Recommending ''against'' a particular course of action
* Providing additional information about a particular course of action without explicitly prescribing or proscribing that course of action
* Recommending ''how'' to go about making the decision (here, too, no courses of action are explicitly prescribed or proscribed)
Of these four types of advice (and [[Social support|socio-emotional support]], which is a related form of interpersonal assistance that often accompanies advice), Dalal and Bonaccio (2010) found that decision-makers reacted most favorably to the provision of information, because this form of advice not only increased decision [[accuracy]] but also allowed the decision-maker to maintain [[autonomy]].&lt;ref name="organizational1"/&gt;

==Methodological advice==

Methodological advice concerns expert advice on [[research methodology]]. This kind of advice is, as opposed to some forms of advising mentioned above, usually initiated by the person who receives the advice, thus not unrequested. The goal of the advisor (see [[statistical consultant]]) is to guarantee the quality of research undertaken by his client, a [[researcher]], by providing sound methodological advice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adèr, H. J.]], [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|Mellenbergh G. J.]], &amp; Hand, D. J. (2008). ''Advising on research methods: A consultants companion.'' Huizen, The Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The advice may take different forms. In some cases the advisor collaborates with a researcher in a more long-term process, and guides him through the more technical parts of the research (this type of advising is called longitudinal consultancy). In complex, longterm projects it is not uncommon for the advisor to help by doing part of the work him or herself (interactive consultancy). In other cases a researcher may have a specific question that can be answered in a brief conversation with a consultant (cross-sectional consultancy, or advisory consulting).&lt;ref&gt;Van Belle, G. (2008). ''Statistical rules of thumb (2nd ed.).'' New York: Wiley: Chapter 10 (pp. 217-235).&lt;/ref&gt; The advisors role can also take a didactic form, when the client is not familiar with suggested (statistical) methods. Sometimes the best advice is not statistically ideal, but is comprehensible for the client.

Depending on the function of the methodological advisor, the advice that is given may not be free. If a student conducts research commissioned by a professor, this professor will probably help this student for free, if needed. However, if a researcher contacts an independent advisor, this probably costs him/her. In this case the methodological advisor is basically being hired by the researcher. In other cases the advisor may be incorporated into research team, leading to co-authorship. It is advisable to make clear agreements about the advisors compensation on fore hand.

Researchers may seek advice on a wide range of subjects concerning their research. One of the major tasks of the methodological advisor is to help his clients think about what they really want to accomplish. This may involve helping them to (re)formulate the [[research question]] and relatedly, the research hypothesis (see [[scientific hypothesis]]). Clients may also seek advice on the construction of a measurement instrument (for instance a [[psychological test]]). Or, they may want to know how to implement an appropriate [[research design]]. Often questions arise on how to analyze the data (see [[data analysis]]), and how to interpret and report the results (see [[scientific publishing]]).

A researcher will usually know more about the field in which the study is conducted than the methodological advisor. The advisor on the other hand will know more about the method. By combining their expertise and, through dialog and cooperation, researcher and consultant may achieve better, more reliable results.&lt;ref&gt;Derr, J. (2008). Having an impact in a multi-disciplinary setting. In [[H. J. Adèr]] &amp; [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|G. J. Mellenbergh]] (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the 2007 KNAW colloquium Advising on research methods'': pp. 11-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Sutherland''' (26 March 1852 – 9 August 1902) was a Scottish-Australian [[teacher|educator]], [[author|writer]] and [[philosopher]].

==Early life and education==
Sutherland was born at [[Glasgow]], both parents were [[Scotland|Scottish]], his father, George Sutherland, a carver of ship's figureheads, married Jane Smith, a woman of character and education. The family came to [[Australia]] in 1864 on account of the father's health, and Alexander at 14 years of age became a pupil-teacher with the education department at [[Sydney]].

==Career==
Coming to [[Melbourne]] in 1870 he first taught at [[Hawthorn Grammar School]] and then entered on the arts course at the [[University of Melbourne|University]]. He maintained himself largely by scholarships and graduated with honours in 1874. For two years he was a mathematical master at [[Scotch College, Melbourne]], and in 1877 founded Carlton College. He was an excellent schoolmaster, and the school was so successful that 15 years later he felt himself able to retire and devote himself to literature.

The [[1893 banking crisis|banking crisis of 1893]], however, affected his position so much, that he was obliged to do a great deal of journalism for the ''[[The Argus (Australia)|Argus]]'' and ''Australasian''. Sutherland did a large amount of literary work. He was responsible for the first volume only of ''Victoria and its Metropolis'', published in 1888, an interesting history of the first 50 years of the state of Victoria. In 1890 he published ''Thirty Short Poems'', the cultured verse of an experienced literary man, but his most important book was ''The Origin and Growth of the Moral Instinct'', which appeared in 1898 in two volumes. Sutherland had long brooded over this book and was greatly pleased at receiving the commendation of some of the leaders of philosophic thought in England. Generally the book was well received both in Europe and the United States. With his brother, George Sutherland, he wrote a short ''History of Australia'', which attained a sale of 120,000 copies, and he collaborated with [[Henry Gyles Turner]] in a useful volume, ''The Development of Australian Literature'' (1898). His undoubted powers as a teacher gave value to his text book, ''A New Geography'', and other works of that kind. He contributed on scientific subjects to the Nineteenth Century, and did a large amount of lecturing on literature and science in Melbourne.

==Career in politics==
In 1897 he became a candidate for [[Parliament of Australia|parliament]], but his methods were too guileless and straightforward to ensure success {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. In 1898, he went to [[London]] as representative of the South Australian Register, but found the climate oppressed him and returned to Australia towards the end of 1899. He continued his [[journalist]]ic work in Melbourne, and in March 1901 was an unsuccessful candidate for the southern Melbourne seat in the first federal parliament. Soon afterwards he was appointed by the council of the [[University of Melbourne]] to the position of registrar.

==Later life and death==
The university was passing through a difficult time after a period of slack administration, and Sutherland had to work very hard. On the death of Professor Morris while away on leave in [[Europe]], Sutherland took over his lectures on English literature. The burden of the extra work was too great for Sutherland who did not have a strong constitution, and he died suddenly on 9 August 1902. His widow, a son and three daughters survived him. His daughter, Margaret Sutherland, became well known as a musician and composer.

'''Ananta''' is a [[Sanskrit]] term which means 'endless' or 'limitless', also means 'eternal' or '[[infinity]]',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|author=Roshen Dalal|publisher=Penguin Books|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=ananta+meaning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mrkpUpLWJOP6iQe2zYCABQ&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=ananta%20meaning&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, it also means infinitude or an unending expansion or without limit. It is one of the many names of Lord [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shri Vishnu Sahasranamam| url=http://kirtimukha.com/chinnamma/sahasra/sloka95.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ananta is the [[Shesha|Shesha-naga]], the celestial snake, on which Lord Vishnu reclines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Heart of Hinduism: The Eastern Path of Freedom, Empowerment and Illumination|author=Stephen Knapp|publisher=iUniverse|page=159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2KPChj7lTwC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=ananta+meaning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZK8pUpShIuawiQe-p4BY&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ananta%20meaning&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Mahabharata]], Ananta or Adi-sesa, the serpent, or [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], is the son of [[Kasyap]]a, one of the [[Prajapati]]s, through Kadru as her eldest son. Kadru had asked her sons to stay suspended in the hair of [[Airavata]]’s tail who on refusing to do so were cursed to die at the serpent-yajna of Janamejaya. Ananta was saved by [[Brahma]] who directed him to go to the nether world and support the world on his hoods, and thus became the king of the [[Naga Kingdom|Nagas]] in [[Patala]]. [[Rudra]], who consumes the three worlds, is believed to have emanated from the face of Ananta. By the grace of Ananta, [[Garga]] was able to master the sciences of astronomy and causation. Vishnu reposes on Ananta floating on the ocean of eternal existence sheltered by his hoods. Ananta is an epithet of [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Murugan|Skanda]], [[Krishna]], [[Balarama]], earth, and the letter [[A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World|author=Ganga Ram Garg|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|pages=424–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjDcd0cTFxQC&amp;pg=PA425&amp;dq=ananta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b38qUrnMB5HrrQfnvIC4Dw&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ananta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic dictionary of the Puranas Vol.1|author=Parameshwaranand|publisher=Sarup and Sons|page=65|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6F0ZIBIL2ZAC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=ananta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dYwqUpOKKcOQrQfZtoCoDw&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=ananta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ananta also appears in the [[Buddhist]] iconography as one of three female deities emanating from Dhyani Buddha Amitabha.

According to the [[Yoga]] School, Ananta is the serpent of infinity who eavesdropped on the secret teaching that was being imparted to Goddess [[Parvati]] by Lord [[Shiva]]; the secret teaching was Yoga. On being apprehended Ananta was sentenced by Lord Shiva to impart that teaching to human beings for which purpose Ananta assumed the human form and was called [[Patanjali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ashtanga Yoga The Intermediate Series: Mythology, anatomy and Practice|author=Gregor Maehle|publisher=New World Library|pages=41, 134|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OhYeGdNK0UoC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=ananta+meaning+of&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V8kpUprCDsytiQe2qYHYBA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ananta%20meaning%20of&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Yoga Sutras]], Patanjali stresses upon the use of breath to achieve perfection in posture which entails steadiness and comfort, by making an effort, the effort meant is the effort of breathing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19890">[[File:Character Displacement.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Character displacement occurs when similar species that live in the same geographical region and occupy similar niches differentiate in order to minimize niche overlap and avoid competitive exclusion. Several species of [[Darwin's finches|Galapagos finches]] display character displacement. Each closely-related species differs in beak size and beak depth, allowing them to coexist in the same region since each species eats a different type of seed: the seed best fit for its unique beak. The finches with the deeper, stronger beaks consume large, tough seeds, while the finches with smaller beaks consume the smaller, softer seeds.]]

'''Character displacement''' is the phenomenon where differences among similar [[species]] whose [[species distribution|distributions]] overlap geographically are accentuated in regions where the species co-occur, but are minimized or lost where the species’ distributions do not overlap. This pattern results from [[evolution]]ary change driven by [[biological competition]] among species for a limited resource (e.g. food). The rationale for character displacement stems from the [[competitive exclusion principle]], also called [[Georgii Gause|Gause]]'s Law, which contends that to coexist in a stable environment two competing species must differ in their respective ecological niche; without differentiation, one species will eliminate or exclude the other through [[competition]].

Character displacement was first explicitly explained by [[William L. Brown Jr.]] and [[E. O. Wilson]] in 1956: "Two closely related species have overlapping ranges.&lt;ref name=BrownWilson1956&gt;{{Citation |title=Character displacement | author=W. L. Brown, Jr. and E. O. Wilson | journal=Systematic Zoology | year=1956 | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=49–64 | doi= 10.2307/2411924}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the parts of the ranges where one species occurs alone, the populations of that species are similar to the other species and may even be very difficult to distinguish from it. In the area of overlap, where the two species occur together, the populations are more divergent and easily distinguished, i.e., they 'displace' one another in one or more characters. The characters involved can be morphological, ecological, behavioral, or physiological; they are assumed to be genetically based."

Brown and Wilson used the term character displacement to refer to instances of both '''reproductive character displacement''', or reinforcement of reproductive barriers, and '''ecological character displacement''' driven by competition.&lt;ref name=BrownWilson1956/&gt; As the term character displacement is commonly used, it generally refers to morphological differences due to competition. Brown and Wilson viewed character displacement as a phenomenon involved in [[speciation]], stating, "we believe that it is a common aspect of geographical speciation, arising most often as a product of the genetic and ecological interaction of two (or more) newly evolved, cognate species [derived from the same immediate parental species] during their period of first contact."&lt;ref name=BrownWilson1956/&gt; While character displacement is important in various scenarios of speciation,&lt;ref&gt;[[Thierry Lodé]] "La guerre des sexes chez les animaux" 2006 Eds Odile jacob, Paris {{ISBN|2-7381-1901-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[adaptive radiation]]s like the cichlid fish faunas in the rift lakes of East Africa,&lt;ref name=Meyer1993&gt;{{Citation |title=Phylogenetic relationships and the evolutionary processes in East African cichlid fishes | author=Axel Meyer | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | year=1993 | volume=8 | issue=8 | pages=279–284 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(93)90255-N }}&lt;/ref&gt; it also plays an important role in structuring communities. It also plays a role in [[Reinforcement (speciation)|speciation by reinforcement]] in such that [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]] populations overlapping in [[Sympatric speciation|sympatry]] exhibit greater trait divergence.&lt;ref name="Noor1999"&gt;{{Citation |title=Reinforcement and other consequences of sympatry | author=Mohamed A. F. Noor | journal=Heredity | year=1999 | volume=83 | issue= | pages=503–508 | doi= 10.1038/sj.hdy.6886320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of numerous studies contribute evidence that character displacement often influences the evolution of resource acquisition among members of an [[guild (ecology)|ecological guild]].&lt;ref name=DayanSimberloff2005&gt;{{Citation |title=Ecological and community-wide character displacement: the next generation | author=Tamar Dayan and Daniel Simberloff | journal=Ecology Letters | year=2005 | volume=8 | issue=8 | pages=875–894 | doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00791.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Competitive release''', defined as the expansion of an [[ecological niche]] in the absence of a competitor, is essentially the mirror image of character displacement.&lt;ref name=Grant1972&gt;{{Citation |title=Convergent and divergent character displacement | author=Peter R. Grant | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | year=1972 | volume=4 | issue=1 | pages=39–68 | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1972.tb00690.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It too was described by Brown and Wilson: “Two closely related species are distinct where they occur together, but where one member of the pair occurs alone it converges toward the second, even to the extent of being nearly identical with it in some characters.”&lt;ref name=BrownWilson1956/&gt;

== Conceptual development ==
“Character displacement is the situation in which, when two species of animals overlap geographically, the differences between them are accentuated in the zone of sympatry and weakened or lost entirely in the parts of their ranges outside this zone”.&lt;ref name=BrownWilson1956/&gt; While the term “ecological character displacement” first appeared in the scientific literature in 1956, the idea has earlier roots. For example, [[Joseph Grinnell]], in the classic paper that set forth the concept of the [[ecological niche]], stated, “It is, of course, axiomatic that no two species regularly established in a single fauna have precisely the same niche requirements.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The niche-relationships of the California thrasher | author=Joseph Grinnell | journal=The Auk | year=1917 | volume=34 | issue=4 | pages=427–433 | doi= 10.2307/4072271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of character displacement is evidence that the two species do not completely overlap in their niche requirement.

Following the dissemination of the concept, character displacement was viewed as an important force in structuring [[ecological communities]], and biologists identified numerous examples. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the role of [[competition]] and character displacement in structuring communities was questioned and its importance greatly downgraded.&lt;ref name=Losos2000&gt;{{Citation |title=Ecological character displacement and the study of adaptation | author=Jonathan B. Losos | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | year=2000 | volume=97 | issue=1 | pages=5693–5695 | doi=10.1073/pnas.97.11.5693 | pmc=33990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many found the early examples unconvincing and suggested it to be a rare phenomenon. Criticisms with earlier studies included the lack of rigor in statistical analyses and the use of poorly rationalized characters.&lt;ref name=DayanSimberloff2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Losos2000/&gt; Additionally, theory seemed to indicate that the conditions that allowed character displacement to occur were limited.&lt;ref name=Losos2000/&gt; This scrutiny helped motivate theoretical and methodological advances as well as the development of a more rigorous framework for testing character displacement.&lt;ref name=Losos2000/&gt;

Six criteria have been developed to establish character displacement as the mechanism for differences between sympatric species.&lt;ref name=TaperCase1992&gt;{{Citation |title=Models of character displacement and the theoretical robustness of taxon cycles | author=Mark L.

Character displacement has indicated to be a major factor in beak size among finches located in the [[Galápagos Islands]] and [[Hawaiian Islands]].&lt;ref name=Schluter1988&gt;{{Citation |title=Character Displacement and the Adaptive Divergence of Finches on Islands and Continents | author=Dolph Schluter | journal=American Naturalist | year=1988 | volume=131 | issue=6 | pages=799–824 | doi=10.1086/284823 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Studies have been performed in a wide variety of taxa—a few groups having disproportionately contributed to the understanding of character displacement: mammalian carnivores, [[Galapagos finch]]es, [[anole lizard]]s on islands, [[three-spined stickleback]] fish, and snails.&lt;ref name=DayanSimberloff2005/&gt;

=== Birds ===
In the initial explication of character displacement, many of the examples set forth as potential evidence for character displacement were observations between multiple pairs of birds. These included rock [[nuthatch]]es in Asia, Australian [[honeyeater]]s of the genus ''[[Myzantha]]'', Australian parrots, [[shearwater]]s in the [[Cape Verde Islands]], flycatchers of the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] and notably, [[Darwin's finches]] in the Galapagos.&lt;ref name=BrownWilson1956/&gt; [[David Lack]] found that when the two species ''[[Geospiza fortis]]'' and ''[[Geospiza fuliginosa|G. fuliginosa]]'' occurred on large islands together, they could be distinguished unequivocally by beak size.&lt;ref name=Lack1947&gt;{{Citation | title=Darwin’s Finches | edition= | author=David Lack | date=1947 | pages= | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When either one occurred by itself on a smaller island, however, the beak size was intermediate in size relative to when the two co-occurred.&lt;ref name=Lack1947/&gt; Similarly, [[Peter and Rosemary Grant]] found that a ''Geospiza fortis'' island population diverged in beak size (due to high mortality) from competitor ''[[Geospiza magnirostris|G. magnirostris]]'' in a year with low food supply, apparently due to increased competition for larger seeds that both species fed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Peter R.|last2=Grant|first2=B. Rosemary|date=2006-07-14|title=Evolution of Character Displacement in Darwin's Finches|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5784/224|journal=Science|language=en|volume=313|issue=5784|pages=224–226|doi=10.1126/science.1128374|issn=0036-8075|pmid=16840700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most character displacement studies focus on morphological differences in feeding apparatus rather than on those relating to habitat use. However, comparisons of micro-habitat use and morphological adaptations of Western and Eastern Rock Nuthatches indicate that these two species show spatial niche segregation in addition to trophic niche segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Yousefi, M. |author2= Kaboli, M. | author3= Eagderi, S. |author4= Mohammadi, A. |author5= Nourani, E. | year=2017| title= Micro-spatial separation and associated morphological adaptations in the original case of avian character displacement. | journal=Ibis| volume=159| pages=883–891| url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ibi.12505/full| doi=10.1111/ibi.12505| issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often assumed that closely related species are more likely to compete than are more distantly related species, and hence many researchers investigate character displacement among species in the same [[genus]].&lt;ref name=DayanSimberloff2005/&gt; While character displacement was originally discussed in the context of very closely related species, evidence suggests that even interactions among distantly related species can result in character displacement. Finches and [[bee]]s in the Galapagos provide support for this.&lt;ref name=Schluter1986&gt;{{Citation |title=Character displacement between distantly related taxa – finches and bees in the Galapagos | author=Dolph Schluter | journal=American Naturalist | year=1986 | volume=127 | issue=1 | pages=95–102 | doi=10.1086/284470 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two finch species (''[[Geospiza fuliginosa]]'' and ''[[Geospiza difficilis|G. difficilis]]'') exploit more flower [[nectar]] on islands where the lager [[carpenter bee]] (''[[Xylocopa darwini]]'') is absent than on islands with the bees. Individual finches that harvest [[nectar]] are smaller than members of the same species that do not.&lt;ref name="Schluter1986"/&gt;

=== Reptiles ===
The lizard genus ''[[Anolis]]'' on the islands in the [[Caribbean]] has also been the subject of numerous studies investigating the role of competition and character displacement in community structure.&lt;ref name=Losos1990&gt;{{Citation |title=A phylogenetic analysis of character displacement in the Caribbean ''Anolis'' lizards | author=Jonathan B. Losos | journal=Evolution | year=1990 | volume=44 | issue=2 | pages=558–569 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1990.tb05938.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lesser Antilles]] islands can only support ''Anolis'' species of different sizes, and the relative importance of character displacement versus size at colonization in determining invasion success has been explored and debated.

=== Amphibians ===
The Appalachian salamanders ''[[Plethodon hoffmani]]'' and ''[[Plethodon cinereus|P. cinereus]]'' display no morphological differences, eating habits, or resource use exploitation differences among allopatric populations; when the species occurs in sympatry; however, they exhibit morphological differentiation that is associated with segregation in prey size.&lt;ref name=AdamsRohlf2000&gt;{{Citation |title=Ecological character displacement in ''Plethodon'': Biomechanical differences found from a geometric morphometric study | author=Dean C. Adams and F. James Rohlf | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | year=2000 | volume=97 | issue=8 | pages=4106–4111 | doi=10.1073/pnas.97.8.4106 | pmc=18164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where these two species co-occur, ''P. hoffmani'' has a faster closing jaw required for larger prey, and ''P. cinereus'' has a slower, stronger jaw for smaller prey. Other studies have found ''[[Plethodon]]'' [[salamander]] species that demonstrate character displacement from aggressive [[behavioral interference]] rather than exploitation.&lt;ref name=Adams2004&gt;{{Citation |title=Character displacement via aggressive interference in Appalachian salamanders | author=Dean C. Adams | journal=Ecology | year=2004 | volume=85 | issue=10 | pages=2664–2670 | doi=10.1890/04-0648}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, '''morphological character displacement''' between the two species is due to aggressive interaction between them rather than the exploitation of different food resources.

=== Molluscs ===
On [[Okinawa Island]], the snail species ''[[Satsuma largillierti]]'' lives on the eastern half of the island, while ''[[Satsuma eucosmia]]'' lives on the eastern half. Both populations overlap in sympatry along the middle of the island, where the penis length of the species differs significantly wherer they meet in sympatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Reproductive Character Displacement in Genital Morphology in ''Satsuma'' Land Snails | author=Yuichi Kameda, Atsushi Kawakita, and Makoto Kato | journal=The American Naturalist | year=2009 | volume=173 | issue=5 | pages=689–697 | doi=10.1086/597607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The snails' penis lengths exhibit divergence, suggesting reproductive character displacement of this trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Evolution | edition=2nd | author=Carl T. Bergstrom and Lee Alan Dugatkin | date=2016 | pages=508–509 | publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company | isbn=9780393937930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish ===
Threespine sticklebacks (''[[Gasterosteus]]'' spp.) in post-glacial lakes in western [[Canada]] have contributed significantly to recent research of character displacement.&lt;ref name=Schluter1993&gt;{{Citation |title=Adaptive Radiation in Sticklebacks: Size, Shape, and Habitat Use Efficiency | author=Dolph Schluter | journal=Ecology | year=1993 | volume=74 | issue=3 | pages=699–709 | doi=10.2307/1940797 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schluter1995&gt;{{Citation |title=Adaptive Radiation in Sticklebacks: Trade-Offs in Feeding Performance and Growth | author=Dolph Schluter | journal=Ecology | year=1995 | volume=76 | issue=1 | pages=82–90 | doi=10.2307/1940633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both observations of natural populations and manipulative experiments show that when two recently evolved species occur in a single lake, two morphologies are selected for: a limnetic form that feeds in open water and a benthic form that feeds at the lake bottom. They differ in size, shape and the number and length of [[gill raker]]s, all of which is related to divergence in their diet. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrids]] between the two forms are selected against. When only one species inhabits a lake, that fish displays an intermediate morphology. Studies on other fish species have shown similar patterns of [[Natural selection|selection]] for benthic and [[Limnetic zone|limnetic]] morphologies,&lt;ref name=DayanSimberloff2005/&gt; which can also lead to [[sympatric speciation]].&lt;ref name="Barluenga et al 2006"&gt;{{Citation |title=Sympatric speciation in Nicaraguan crater lake cichlid fish | author=Marta Barluenga, Kai N.

=== Mammals ===
[[Introduced species]] have also provided recent “natural experiments” to investigate how rapidly character displacement can affect evolutionary change.&lt;ref name=DayanSimberloff2005/&gt; When American [[mink]] (''[[Mustela vison]]'') were introduced in north-eastern [[Belarus]], the native European mink (''[[Mustela lutreola]]'') increased in size, and the introduced mink decreased in size.&lt;ref name=Sidorovich1999&gt;{{Citation |title=Body size, and interactions between European and American mink (Mustela lutreola and M. vison) in Eastern Europe | author=V.

'''Denis Diderot''' ({{IPA-fr|dəni did(ə)ʁo|lang}}; 5 October 1713{{snd}}31 July 1784) was a French philosopher, [[art critic]], and writer, best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor, and contributor to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' along with [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. He was a prominent figure during the [[Age of the Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

Diderot began his education by obtaining a Master of Arts degree in philosophy at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college in 1732. He considered working in the church clergy before briefly studying law. When he decided to become a writer in 1734, his father disowned him for not entering one of the [[Profession|learned profession]]s. He lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] existence for the next decade. He befriended philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in 1742.

Though his work was broad as well as rigorous, it did not bring Diderot riches. He secured none of the posts that were occasionally given to needy men of letters; he could not even obtain the bare official recognition of merit that was implied by being chosen a member of the [[Académie française]]. He saw no alternative to selling his library to provide a [[dowry]] for his daughter. Empress [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II of Russia]] heard of his financial troubles and commissioned an agent in Paris to buy the library. She then requested that the philosopher retain the books in Paris until she required them, and act as her librarian with a yearly salary.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Diderot, Denis |volume=8 |pages=204-06 |first=John |last=Morley|authorlink=John Morley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between October 1773 and March 1774, the sick Diderot spent a few months at the empress's court in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="Arthur Wilson 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Verzaal|first=Elly|url=http://blog.kb.nl/diderot-op-de-kneuterdijk-1|title=Diderot op de Kneuterdijk (1)|trans-title=Diderot on Kneuterdijk (1)|language=nl|publisher=[[National Library of the Netherlands]]|date=25 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021144239/http://blog.kb.nl/diderot-op-de-kneuterdijk-1|archivedate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diderot died of [[Pulmonary embolism|pulmonary thrombosis]] in Paris on 31 July 1784, and was buried in the city's [[Saint-Roch, Paris|Église Saint-Roch]]. His heirs sent his vast library to Catherine II, who had it deposited at the [[National Library of Russia]]. He has several times been denied burial in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] with other French notables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blom|first=Philipp|author-link=Philipp Blom|title=In the Panthéon|url=http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/on-history/in-the-pantheon.php?page=all|journal=[[Lapham's Quarterly]]|accessdate=27 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113165624/http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/on-history/in-the-pantheon.php?page=all|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French government considered memorializing him in this fashion on the 300th anniversary of his birth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Curran|first=Andrew S.|title=Diderot, an American Exemplar?

Diderot's literary reputation during his lifetime rested primarily on his plays and his contributions to the ''Encyclopédie''; many of his most important works, including ''[[Jacques the Fatalist]], [[Rameau's Nephew]]'', ''[[Paradox of the Actor]]'', and ''[[Le Rêve de d’Alembert|D'Alembert's Dream]]'', were published only after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Hampson.

==Early life==

[[File:Langres - Denis Diderot.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statue of Denis Diderot in the city of [[Langres]], his birthplace]]

Denis Diderot was born in [[Langres]], [[Province of Champagne|Champagne]]. His parents were [[Didier Diderot]] (1685–1759) a [[Cutlery|cutler]], ''maître coutelier'', and his wife Angélique Vigneron (1677–1748). Three of five siblings survived to adulthood, Denise Diderot (1715–1797) and their youngest brother Pierre-Didier Diderot (1722–1787), and finally their sister Angélique Diderot (1720–1749). According to Arthur McCandless Wilson, Denis Diderot greatly admired his sister Denise, sometimes referring to her as "a female [[Socrates]]".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Wilson. ''Diderot: The Testing Years, 1713–1759.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1957, p. 14 [https://archive.org/stream/diderotthetestin001232mbp/diderotthetestin001232mbp_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Diderot began his formal education at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college in Langres, earning a Master of Arts degree in philosophy in 1732. He then entered the [[Collège d'Harcourt]] of the [[University of Paris]]. He abandoned the idea of entering the clergy and decided to study at the [[Paris Law Faculty]]. His study of law was short-lived however and in 1734, he decided to become a writer. Because of his refusal to enter one of the [[Profession|learned profession]]s, he was disowned by his father, and for the next ten years he lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] existence.&lt;ref name="Arthur Wilson 1972"&gt;Arthur Wilson, ''Diderot'' (New York: Oxford, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1742, he befriended [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. In 1743, he further alienated his father by marrying [[Anne-Antoinette Diderot|Antoinette Champion]] (1710–1796), a devout Roman Catholic. The match was considered inappropriate due to Champion's low social standing, poor education, fatherless status, and lack of a dowry. She was about three years older than Diderot. The marriage, in October 1743, produced one surviving child, a girl. Her name was Angélique, named after both Diderot's dead mother and sister. The death of his sister, a nun, in her convent may have affected Diderot's opinion of religion. She is assumed to have been the inspiration for his novel about a nun, ''[[La Religieuse (novel)|La Religieuse]]'', in which he depicts a woman who is forced to enter a convent where she suffers at the hands of the other nuns in the community.&lt;ref name="Arthur Wilson 1972"/&gt;

Diderot had affairs with Mlle. Babuti (who would marry [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze|Greuze]]), [[Madeleine de Puisieux]], [[Louise-Henriette Volland|Sophie Volland]] and [[Mme de Maux]].&lt;ref name = 'Age of Voltaire 675-6'&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9: The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|pages=675–76|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; His letters to Sophie Volland are known for their candor and are regarded to be "among the literary treasures of the eighteenth century".&lt;ref name = 'Age of Voltaire 675'&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=675|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early works ==
Diderot's earliest works included a translation of [[Temple Stanyan]]'s ''History of Greece'' (1743); with two colleagues, [[François-Vincent Toussaint]] and [[Marc-Antoine Eidous]], he produced a translation of [[Robert James (physician)|Robert James]]'s ''Medicinal Dictionary'' (1746–1748).&lt;ref&gt;Mark Twain, "A Majestic Literary Fossil", originally from ''Harper's New Monthly Magazine'', vol. 80, issue 477, pp. 439–44, February 1890. [http://www.harpers.org/AMajesticLiteraryFossil.html Online] at ''Harper's'' site. Accessed 24 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1745, he published a translation of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]]'s ''Inquiry Concerning Virtue and Merit'', to which he had added his own "reflections".&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 625"/&gt;

===''Philosophical Thoughts''===
{{main|Philosophical Thoughts}}
In 1746, Diderot wrote his first original work: the ''[[Philosophical Thoughts]]'' (French:''Pensées philosophiques'').&lt;ref name="Furbank 1992 27"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diderot:A Critical Biography|author=P.N. Furbank|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|page=27|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Magee. The Story of Philosophy. DK Publishing, Inc., New York: 1998. p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Diderot argued for a reconciliation of reason with feeling so as to establish harmony. According to Diderot, without feeling there is a detrimental effect on virtue, and no possibility of creating sublime work. However, since feeling without discipline can be destructive, reason is necessary to control feeling.&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 625"/&gt;

At the time Diderot wrote this book he was a deist. Hence there is a defense of [[deism]] in this book, and some arguments against atheism.&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 625"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=625|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also contains criticism of Christianity.&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 626"/&gt;

===''The Skeptic's Walk''===
{{main|The Skeptic's Walk}}
In 1747, Diderot wrote ''The Skeptic's Walk'' (French:''Promenade du sceptique'')&lt;ref name="Fellows 1977 41"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diderot|author=Otis Fellows|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|page=41|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a deist, an atheist, and a pantheist have a dialogue on the nature of divinity. The deist gives the [[Teleological argument|argument from design]]. The atheist says that the universe is better explained by physics, chemistry, matter, and motion. The pantheist says that the cosmic unity of mind and matter, which are co-eternal and comprise the universe, is God. This work remained unpublished till 1830. The local police—warned by the priests of another attack on Christianity—either seized the manuscript, or authorities forced Diderot give an undertaking that he would not publish this work, according to different versions of what happened.&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 626"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=626|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Indiscreet Jewels''===
{{main|The Indiscreet Jewels}}
In 1748, Diderot needed to raise money on short notice. He had become a father through his wife, and his mistress [[Madeleine de Puisieux|Mme. de Puisieux]] was making financial demands from him. At this time, Diderot had stated to Mme. de Puisieux that writing a novel was a trivial task, whereupon she challenged him to write a novel. In response, Diderot wrote his novel ''[[The Indiscreet Jewels]]'' (French:''Les bijoux indiscrets'').

Besides the bawdiness there are several digressions into philosophy, music, and literature in the book. In one such philosophical digression, the Sultan has a dream in which he sees a child named "Experiment" growing bigger and stronger till it demolishes an ancient temple named "Hypothesis". The book proved to be lucrative for Diderot even though it could only be sold clandestinely. It is Diderot's most published work.&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 627"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=627|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is believed to be an imitation of [[The Sofa: A Moral Tale|''Le Sopha'']].&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 627"/&gt;

===Scientific work===
Diderot would keep writing on science in a desultory way all his life. The scientific work of which he was most proud was ''Memoires sur differents sujets de mathematique'' (1748). This work contains original ideas on [[acoustics]], tension, [[air resistance]], and "a project for a new organ" which could be played by all. Some of Diderot's scientific works were applauded by contemporary publications of his time like ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', the ''Journal des savants''; and the Jesuit publication ''Journal de Trevoux,'' which invited more such work: "on the part of a man as clever and able as M. Diderot seems to be, of whom we should also observe that his style is as elegant, trenchant, and unaffected as it is lively and ingenious."&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 627"/&gt;

===''Letter on the Blind''===
Diderot's celebrated ''[[Letter on the Blind]]'' (''Lettre sur les aveugles à l'usage de ceux qui voient'') (1749) introduced him to the world as an original thinker.{{sfn|Morley|1911}} The subject is a discussion of the interrelation between man's reason and the [[knowledge]] acquired through perception (the [[sense|five senses]]). The title of his book also evoked some ironic doubt about who exactly were "the blind" under discussion. In the essay, blind English mathematician [[Nicholas Saunderson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stephens |first1=Mitchell |title=Imagine there's no heaven: how atheism helped create the modern world |date=2014 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=9781137002600 |oclc=852658386 |pages=123–24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WN-dAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=9781137002600&amp;pg=PA123#v=onepage |accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that, since knowledge derives from the senses, mathematics is the only form of knowledge that both he and a sighted person can agree on. It is suggested that the blind could be taught to read through their sense of touch. (A later essay, ''Lettre sur les sourds et muets'', considered the case of a similar deprivation in the [[deaf]] and [[speech disorder|mute]].) According to [[Jonathan Israel]], what makes the ''Lettre sur les aveugles'' so remarkable, however, is its distinct, if undeveloped, presentation of the theory of [[Genetic variability|variation]] and [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Diderot's contemporary, also a Frenchman, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]—who in 1745 was named Head of the Prussian Academy of Science under [[Frederic the Great]]—was developing similar ideas. These proto-evolutionary theories were by no means as thought out and systematic as those of [[Charles Darwin]] a hundred years later.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This powerful essay, for which [[La Mettrie]] expressed warm appreciation in 1751, revolves around a remarkable deathbed scene in which a dying blind philosopher, Saunderson, rejects the arguments of a [[Deism|deist]] clergyman who endeavours to win him round to a belief in a [[Divine Providence|providential]] God during his last hours. Saunderson's arguments are those of a neo-[[Spinoza|Spinozist]] [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalist]] and [[fatalist]], using a sophisticated notion of the [[Spontaneous generation|self-generation]] and natural evolution of species without Creation or supernatural intervention. The notion of [[Materialism|"thinking matter"]] is upheld and the "[[argument from design]]" discarded (following La Mettrie) as hollow and unconvincing. The work appeared anonymously in Paris in June 1749, and was vigorously suppressed by the authorities. Diderot, who had been under police surveillance since 1747, was swiftly identified as the author, had his manuscripts confiscated, and was imprisoned for some months, under a ''[[lettre de cachet]]'', on the outskirts of Paris, in the dungeons at [[Vincennes]] where he was visited almost daily by [[Rousseau]], at the time his closest and most assiduous ally.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan I. Israel, ''Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750.'' ([[Oxford University Press]]. 2001, 2002), p. 710&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Voltaire wrote an enthusiastic letter to Diderot commending the ''Lettre'' and stating that he had held Diderot in high regard for a long time to which Diderot had sent a warm response. Soon after this, Diderot was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|pages=629–30|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science historian [[Conway Zirkle]] has written that Diderot was an [[History of evolutionary thought|early evolutionary thinker]] and noted that his passage that described natural selection was "so clear and accurate that it almost seems that we would be forced to accept his conclusions as a logical necessity even in the absence of the evidence collected since his time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |date=April 25, 1941 |title=Natural Selection before the 'Origin of Species' |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]] |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]] |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71–123 |jstor=984852 |issn=0003-049X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incarceration and release==
Angered by public resentment over the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle]], the government started incarcerating many of its critics. It was decided at this time to rein in Diderot. On 23 July 1749, the governor of the [[Vincennes]] fortress instructed the police to incarcerate Diderot, and the next day he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement in the Vincennes. He had been permitted to retain one book that he had in his possession at the time of his arrest, ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', which he read during his incarceration. He wrote notes and annotations on the book, using a toothpick as a pen, and ink that he made by scraping slate from the walls and mixing it with wine.&lt;ref name = 'Age of Voltaire 630'&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=630|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1749, [[Émilie du Châtelet|Mme du Chatelet]], presumably at [[Voltaire]]'s behest, wrote to the governor of Vincennes, who was her kinsman, pleading that Diderot be lodged more comfortably while jailed. The governor then offered Diderot access to the great halls of the Vincennes castle and the freedom to receive books and visitors providing he would write a document of submission.&lt;ref name = 'Age of Voltaire 630'/&gt; On 13 August 1749, Diderot wrote to the governor:

{{quote|I admit to you...that the ''Pensees'', the ''Bijoux'', and the ''Lettre sur les aveugles'' are debaucheries of the mind that escaped from me; but I can...promise you on my honor (and I do have honor) that they will be the last, and that they are the only ones...As for those who have taken part in the publication of these works, nothing will be hidden from you. I shall depose verbally, in the depths[secrecy] of your heart, the names both of the publishers and the printers.&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 631"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=631|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 20 August, Diderot was lodged in a comfortable room in the Vincennes, allowed to meet visitors, and to walk in the gardens of the Vincennes. On 23 August, Diderot signed another letter promising to never leave the Vincennes without permission.&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 631"/&gt; On 3 November 1749, Diderot was released from the Vincennes.&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1965 632"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=632|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in 1750, he released the prospectus for the ''[[Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers|Encyclopédie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=633|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Encyclopédie ==
{{Main|Encyclopédie}}

===Genesis===
[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|Title page of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'']]

[[André le Breton]], a bookseller and printer, approached Diderot with a project for the publication of a translation of [[Ephraim Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' into French, first undertaken by the Englishman [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]], and followed by the German [[Gottfried Sellius]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Diderot accepted the proposal, and transformed it. He persuaded Le Breton to publish a new work, which would consolidate ideas and knowledge from the [[Republic of Letters]]. The publishers found capital for a larger enterprise than they had first planned. [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] was persuaded to become Diderot's colleague, and permission was procured from the government.

In 1750 an elaborate prospectus announced the project, and in 1751 the first volume was published.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; This work was unorthodox and advanced for the time. Diderot stated that "An encyclopedia ought to make good the failure to execute such a project hitherto, and should encompass not only the fields already covered by the academies, but each and every branch of human knowledge." Comprehensive knowledge will give "the power to change men's common way of thinking."&lt;ref&gt;Examples are Diderot's articles on Asian philosophy and religion; see [[Urs App]]. ''The Birth of Orientalism''. Philadelphia: [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], 2010 ({{ISBN|978-0-8122-4261-4}}), pp. 133–87.&lt;/ref&gt; The work combined scholarship with information on trades. Diderot emphasized the abundance of knowledge within each subject area. Everyone would benefit from these insights.

===Controversies===
Diderot's work, however, was mired in controversy from the beginning; the project was suspended by the courts in 1752. Just as the second volume was completed accusations arose regarding seditious content, concerning the editor's entries on religion and natural law. Diderot was detained and his house was searched for manuscripts for subsequent articles: but the search proved fruitless as no manuscripts could be found. They were hidden in the house of an unlikely confederate—[[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Chretien de Lamoignon Malesherbes]], who originally ordered the search. Although Malesherbes was a staunch absolutist, and loyal to the monarchy - he was sympathetic to the literary project. Along with his support, and that of other well-placed influential confederates, the project resumed. Diderot returned to his efforts only to be constantly embroiled in controversy.

These twenty years were to Diderot not merely a time of incessant drudgery, but harassing persecution and desertion of friends. The ecclesiastical party detested the ''Encyclopédie'', in which they saw a rising stronghold for their philosophic enemies. By 1757 they could endure it no longer - the subscribers had grown from 2,000 to 4,000, a measure of the growth of the work in popular influence and power.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Diderot wanted the ''Encyclopédie'' to give all the knowledge of the world to the people of France. However, the ''Encyclopédie'' threatened the governing social classes of France (aristocracy) because it took for granted the justice of [[religious tolerance]], [[freedom of thought]], and the value of science and industry.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. "Books: A Living History". Getty Publishing, 2011, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; It asserted the doctrine that the main concern of the nation's government ought to be the nation's common people. It was believed that the ''Encyclopédie'' was the work of an organized band of conspirators against society, and that the dangerous ideas they held were made truly formidable by their open publication. In 1759, the ''Encyclopédie'' was formally suppressed.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The decree did not stop the work, which went on, but its difficulties increased by the necessity of being clandestine. [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] withdrew from the enterprise and other powerful colleagues, including [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]], declined to contribute further to a book which had acquired a bad reputation.{{sfn|Morley|1911}}

===Diderot's contribution===
Diderot was left to finish the task as best he could. He wrote several hundred articles, some very slight, but many of them laborious, comprehensive, and long. He damaged his eyesight correcting proofs and editing the manuscripts of less competent contributors. He spent his days at workshops, mastering manufacturing processes, and his nights writing what he had learned during the day. He was incessantly harassed by threats of police raids. The last copies of the first volume were issued in 1765.

In 1764, when his immense work was drawing to an end, he encountered a crowning mortification: he discovered that the bookseller, Le Breton, fearing the government's displeasure, had struck out from the proof sheets, after they had left Diderot's hands, all passages that he considered too dangerous. "He and his printing-house overseer," writes Furbank, "had worked in complete secrecy, and had moreover deliberately destroyed the author's original manuscript so that the damage could not be repaired."&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Furbank.  ''Diderot: A Critical Biography.'' New York: Knopf, 1992, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; The monument to which Diderot had given the labor of twenty long and oppressive years was irreparably mutilated and defaced.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; It was 12 years, in 1772, before the subscribers received the final 28 folio volumes of the ''Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers'' since the first volume had been published.

== Mature works ==
Although the ''Encyclopédie'' was Diderot's most monumental product, he was the author of many other works that sowed nearly every intellectual field with new and creative ideas.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Diderot's writing ranges from a graceful trifle like the ''Regrets sur ma vieille robe de chambre'' (''Regrets for my Old Dressing Gown'') up to the heady ''[[D'Alembert's Dream]]'' (''Le Rêve de d'Alembert'') (composed 1769), a philosophical dialogue in which he plunges into the depths of the controversy as to the ultimate constitution of [[matter]] and the [[Meaning of life (philosophy)|meaning of life]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; ''[[Jacques le fataliste]]'' (written in 1773, but not published until 1792 in German and 1796 in French) is similar to ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'' and ''The Sentimental Journey'' in its challenge to the conventional novel's structure and content.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Smietanski, ''Le Réalisme dans Jacques le Fataliste'' (Paris: Nizet, 1965); Will McMorran, ''The Inn and the Traveller: Digressive Topographies in the Early Modern European Novel'' (Oxford: Legenda, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Rameau's Nephew''===
The dialogue ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]'' (French: ''Le Neveu de Rameau'') is a "farce-tragedy" reminiscent of the ''Satires'' of [[Horace]], a favorite classical author of Diderot's whose lines "Vertumnis, quotquot sunt, natus iniquis" ("A man born when every single [[Vertumnus]] was out of sorts") appear as epigraph. According to Nicholas Cronk, ''Rameau's Nephew'' is "arguably the greatest work of the French Enlightenment's greatest writer."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cronk, "Introduction", in ''Rameau's Nephew and First Satire'', Oxford: Oxford UP, 2006 (pp. vii–xxv), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diderot's intention in writing the dialogue—whether as a satire on contemporary manners, a reduction of the theory of [[Individualism|self-interest]] to an absurdity, the application of [[irony]] to the ethics of ordinary convention, a mere setting for a discussion about music, or a vigorous dramatic sketch of a parasite and a human original—is disputed. In political terms it explores "the bipolarisation of the social classes under absolute monarchy," and insofar as its protagonist demonstrates how the servant often manipulates the master, ''[[Le Neveu de Rameau]]'' can be seen to anticipate Hegel's [[master–slave dialectic]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Varloot, "Préface", in: Jean Varloot, ed. ''Le Neveu de Rameau et autres dialogues philosophiques'', Paris: Gallimard, 1972 pp. 9–28, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Un dîner de philosophes.Jean Huber.jpg|thumb|300px|''Un dîner de philosophes'' painted by [[Jean Huber]]. Denis Diderot is the second from the right (seated).]]

The narrator in the book recounts a conversation with [[:fr: Jean-François Rameau|Jean-François Rameau]], nephew of the famous [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]. The nephew composes and teaches music with some success but feels disadvantaged by his name and is jealous of his uncle. Eventually he sinks into an indolent and debauched state. After his wife's death, he loses all self-esteem and his brusque manners result in him being ostracized by former friends. A character profile of the nephew is now sketched by Diderot: a man who was once wealthy and comfortable with a pretty wife, who is now living in poverty and decadence, shunned by his friends. And yet this man retains enough of his past to analyze his despondency philosophically and maintains his sense of humor. Essentially he believes in nothing—not in religion, nor in morality; nor in the  Roussean view about nature being better than civilization since in his opinion every species in nature consumes one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=660|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He views the same process at work in the economic world where men consume each other through the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|pages=660–01|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wise man, according to the nephew, will consequently practice hedonism: 

{{Quote|Hurrah for wisdom and philosophy!--the wisdom of Solomon: to drink good wines, gorge on choice foods, tumble pretty women, sleep on downy beds; outside of that, all is vanity.&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 661"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=661|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The dialogue ends with Diderot calling the nephew a wastrel, a coward, and a glutton devoid of spiritual values to which the nephew replies: "I believe you are right."&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 661"/&gt;

The publication history of the ''Nephew'' is circuitous. Written in 1761, Diderot never saw the work through to publication during his lifetime, and apparently did not even share it with his friends. After Diderot's death, a copy of the text reached [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], who gave it to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], who, in 1805, translated the work into German.{{sfn|Morley|1911}} Goethe's translation entered France, and was retranslated into French in 1821. Another copy of the text was published in 1823, but it had been expurgated by Diderot's daughter prior to publication. The original manuscript was only found in 1891.&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1965 659"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=659|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==
Diderot's most intimate friend was the [[philologist]] [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Friedrich Melchior Grimm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=677|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were brought together by their friend in common at that time, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1965 632"/&gt; In 1753, Grimm began writing  a newsletter, the ''La Correspondance littéraire, philosophique et critique'', which he would send to various high personages in Europe.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2014/02/grimm-heirs.html|title=Grimm's Heirs|date= 11 February 2014|work=The New Atlantis: A Journal of Technology and Society|first=Alan |last=Jacobs|accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1759, Grimm asked Diderot to report on the biennial art exhibitions in the [[Louvre]] for the ''Correspondance''. Diderot reported on the [[Salon (Paris)|Salons]] between 1759 and 1771 and again in 1775 and 1781.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|pages=666–87|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot's reports would become "the most celebrated contributions to La Correspondance."&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt;

According to [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]], Diderot's reports initiated the French into a new way of laughing, and introduced people to the mystery and purport of colour by ideas. "Before Diderot", [[Germaine de Staël|Anne Louise Germaine de Staël]] wrote, "I had never seen anything in pictures except dull and lifeless colours; it was his imagination that gave them relief and life, and it is almost a new sense for which I am indebted to his genius".&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Diderot had appended an ''Essai sur la peinture'' to his report on the 1765 Salon in which he expressed his views on artistic beauty. [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] described the ''Essai sur la peinture'' as "a magnificent work; it speaks even more usefully to the poet than to the painter, though for the painter too it is a torch of blazing illumination".&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1965 668"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=668|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (1725–1805) was Diderot's favorite contemporary artist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters''. Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–25. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot appreciated Greuze's sentimentality, and more particularly Greuze's portrayals of his wife who had once been Diderot's mistress.&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1965 668"/&gt;

==Theatre==
Diderot wrote sentimental plays, ''[[Le Fils naturel]]'' (1757) and ''[[Le Père de famille]]'' (1758), accompanying them with essays on theatrical theory and practice, including "Les Entretiens sur ''Le Fils Naturel''" (Conversations on ''The Natural Son''), in which he announced the principles of a new drama: the 'serious genre', a realistic midpoint between comedy and tragedy that stood in opposition to the stilted conventions of the classical French stage.  Diderot introduced {{When|date=July 2018}} the concept of the [[fourth wall]], the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage in a traditional three-walled [[box set (theatre)|box set]] in a [[proscenium]] theatre, through which the audience sees the action in the world of the play.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bell |first=Elizabeth S. |title=Theories of Performance |year=2008 |publisher=Sage |location=Los Angeles | isbn = 978-1-4129-2637-9 |page=203 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallis |first=Mick |last2=Shepherd |first2=Simon |title=Studying plays |year=1998 |publisher=Arnold |location=London | isbn = 0-340-73156-7 |page=214 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abelman"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Abelman |first=Robert |title=Reaching a critical mass: a critical analysis of television entertainment |year=1998 |publisher=L.

==Diderot and Catherine the Great==
===Journey to Russia===

When the Russian Empress [[Catherine the Great]] heard that Diderot was in need of money, she arranged to buy his library and appoint him caretaker of it until his death, at a salary of  1,000 livres per year. She even paid him 25 years salary in advance.&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1967 448"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=448|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Diderot hated traveling,&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1965 674"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=674|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was obliged to visit her.&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1967 448"/&gt;

On 9 October 1773, he reached St. Petersburg, met Catherine the next day and they had several discussions on various subjects. During his five-month stay at her court, he met her almost every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|pages=448–49|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these conversations, he would later state, they spoke 'man to man'.&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1967 448"/&gt;&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{refn|group=note|Diderot later narrated the following conversation as having taken place: 

{{quote|''Catherine'': "You have a hot head, and I have one too. We interrupt each other, we do not hear what the other one says, and so we say stupid things." 

''Diderot'': "With this difference, that when I interrupt your Majesty, I commit a great impertinence."

''Catherine'': "No, between men there is no such thing as impertinence."&lt;ref name="Furbank 1992 379"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diderot:A Critical Biography|author=P.N. Furbank|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|page=379|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  &lt;!--END OF NOTE--&gt;}} 

He would occasionally make his point by slapping her thighs. In a letter to [[Marie Thérèse Rodet Geoffrin|Madame Geoffrin]], Catherine wrote:

{{Quote|Your Diderot is an extraordinary man. I emerge from interviews with him with my thighs bruised and quite black. I have been obliged to put a table between us to protect myself and my members.&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1967 448"/&gt;}}

One of the topics discussed was Diderot's ideas about how to transform Russia into a utopia. In a letter to [[Louis Philippe, comte de Ségur|Comte de Ségur]], the Empress wrote that if she followed Diderot's advice, chaos would ensue in her kingdom.&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1967 448"/&gt;

===Back in France===
When returning, Diderot asked the Empress for 1,500 rubles as reimbursement for his trip. She gave him 3,000 rubles, an expensive ring, and an officer to escort him back to Paris. He would write a eulogy in her honor on reaching Paris.&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1967 449"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=449|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1784, upon hearing that Diderot was in poor health, Catherine arranged for him to move into a luxurious suite in the ''Rue de Richelieu''. Diderot died two weeks after moving there—on 31 July 1784.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=893|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Diderot's last works were notes "On the Instructions of her Imperial Majesty...for the Drawing up of Laws". This commentary on Russia included replies to some arguments Catherine had made in the [[Nakaz]].&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1967 449"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Furbank 1992 393"/&gt; Diderot wrote that Catherine was certainly despotic, due to circumstances and training, but was not inherently tyrannical. Thus, if she wished to destroy despotism in Russia, she should abdicate her throne and destroy anyone who tries to revive the monarchy.&lt;ref name="Furbank 1992 393"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diderot:A Critical Biography|author=P.N. Furbank|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|page=393|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; She should publicly declare that "there is no true sovereign other than the nation, and there can be no true legislator other than the people."&lt;ref name="Furbank 1992 394"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diderot:A Critical Biography|author=P.N. Furbank|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|page=394|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; She should create a new Russian legal code establishing an independent legal framework and starting with the text: "We the people, and we the sovereign of this people, swear conjointly these laws, by which we are judged equally."&lt;ref name="Furbank 1992 394"/&gt; In the ''Nakaz'', Catherine had written: "It is for legislation to follow the spirit of the nation."&lt;ref name="Furbank 1992 394"/&gt; Diderot's rebuttal stated that it is for legislation to ''make'' the spirit of the nation. For instance, he argued, it is not appropriate to make public executions unnecessarily horrific.&lt;ref name="Furbank 1992 394-5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diderot:A Critical Biography|author=P.N. Furbank|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pages=394–95|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Diderot decided not to send these notes to Catherine; however, they were delivered to her with his other papers after he died. When she read them, she was furious and commented that they were an incoherent gibberish devoid of prudence, insight, and verisimilitude.&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1967 449"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Furbank 1992 395"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diderot:A Critical Biography|author=P.N. Furbank|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|page=395|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
In his youth, Diderot was originally a follower of [[Voltaire]] and his [[Deism|deist]] ''Anglomanie'', but gradually moved away from this line of thought towards [[materialism]] and [[atheism]], a move which was finally realised in 1747 in the philosophical debate in the second part of his ''[[The Skeptic's Walk]]'' (1747).&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan I. Israel, ''Enlightenment Contested'', Oxford University Press, 2006, pp. 791, 818.&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot opposed mysticism and occultism, which were highly prevalent in France at the time he wrote, and believed religious truth claims must fall under the domain of reason, not mystical experience or esoteric secrets. However, Diderot showed some interest in the work of [[Paracelsus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 53–5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was "a philosopher in whom all the contradictions of the time struggle with one another" ([[Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz|Rosenkranz]]).{{sfn|Morley|1911}}

In his 1754 book ''[[On the interpretation of Nature]]'', Diderot expounded on his views about Nature, evolution, materialism, mathematics, and experimental science.&lt;ref name = "Durant 1965 651-2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|pages=651–52|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Furbank 1992 109-115"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diderot:A Critical Biography|author=P.N. Furbank|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pages=109–15|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that Diderot may have contributed to his friend [[Baron d'Holbach]]'s 1770 book ''[[The System of Nature]]''.{{sfn|Morley|1911}} Diderot had enthusiastically endorsed the book stating that: {{quote|What I like is a philosophy clear, definite, and frank, such as you have in the ''System of Nature''. The author is not an atheist on one page and a deist on another. His philosophy is all of one piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=700|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In conceiving the ''Encyclopédie'', Diderot had thought of the work as a fight on behalf of posterity and had expressed confidence that posterity would be grateful for his effort. According to Diderot, "posterity is for the philosopher what the 'other world' is for the man of religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=641|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appreciation and influence==
[[File:Jean-Simon Berthélemy - Bildnis eines Herrn mit der Büste des Denis Diderot.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Simon Berthélemy]], Young man admiring Denis Diderot's bust]]

[[Jean-François Marmontel|Marmontel]] and [[:fr:Jacques-Henri Meister|Henri Meister]] commented on the great pleasure of having intellectual conversations with Diderot.&lt;ref name = "Durant 1965 678"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=678|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Morellet|Morellet]], a regular attendee at [[Baron d'Holbach#D'Holbach's salon|D'Holbach's salon]], wrote: "It is there that I heard...Diderot treat questions of philosophy, art, or literature, and by his wealth of expression, fluency, and inspired appearance, hold our attention for a long stretch of time."&lt;ref name = "Wilson 1972 175"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diderot|author=Arthur M. Wilson|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=175 |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot's contemporary, and rival, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean Jacques Rousseau]] wrote in his ''Confessions'' that after a few centuries Diderot would be accorded as much respect by posterity as was given to Plato and Aristotle.&lt;ref name = "Durant 1965 678"/&gt; In Germany, [[Goethe]], [[Schiller]], and Lessing&lt;ref&gt;name = "Age of Voltaire 679"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=679|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed admiration for Diderot's writings, Goethe pronouncing Diderot's ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]'' to be "the classical work of an outstanding man" and that "Diderot is Diderot, a unique individual; whoever carps at him and his affairs is a philistine."&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1965 659"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hammer Jr. |first1=Carl |title=Goethe and Rousseau: Resonances of the Mind |date=2015 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next century, Diderot was admired by [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Stendhal]], [[Émile Zola|Zola]], and [[Schopenhauer]].&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Furbank. ''Diderot: A Critical Biography.'' New York: Knopf, 1992. p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], Diderot was the foremost intellectual in an exciting age.&lt;ref name = "Age of Voltaire 679"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=679|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Jules Michelet|Michelet]] described him as "the true Prometheus" and stated that Diderot's ideas would continue to remain influential long into the future. [[Karl Marx|Marx]] chose Diderot as his "favourite prose-writer."&lt;ref&gt;David McClellan. ''Karl Marx: His Life and Thought.'' New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1973. p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary tributes==
[[File:Diderot-statue.jpg|thumb|Monument to Denis Diderot in Paris, [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]], by [[Jean Gautherin]]]]

[[Otis Fellows]] and Norman Torrey have described Diderot as "the most interesting and provocative figure of the French eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author = Ottis Fellows and Norman Torrey|journal=Diderot Studies |volume=1|year=1949 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, American writer Cathleen Schine published ''Rameau's Niece'', a satire of academic life in New York that took as its premise a woman's research into an (imagined) 18th-century pornographic parody of Diderot's ''Rameau's Nephew''. The book was praised by Michiko Kakutani in the ''New York Times'' as "a nimble philosophical satire of the academic mind" and "an enchanting comedy of modern manners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/11/specials/schine-niece.html|title=Specials|website=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French author Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt wrote a play titled ''Le Libertin'' (''The Libertine'') which imagines a day in Diderot's life including a fictional sitting for a woman painter which becomes sexually charged but is interrupted by the demands of editing the ''Encyclopédie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric-emmanuel-schmitt.com/theatre.cfm?nomenclatureId=1796&amp;catalogid=801&amp;&amp;lang=EN|title=Theatre|website=www.eric-emmanuel-schmitt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first staged at Paris' Théâtre Montparnasse in 1997 starring Bernard Giraudeau as Diderot and Christiane Cohendy as Madame Therbouche and was well received by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatreonline.com/Artiste/Eric-Emmanuel-Schmitt/9756|title=Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt - THEATREonline.com|website=www.theatreonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the tricentennial of Diderot's birth, his hometown of Langres held a series of events in his honor and produced an audio tour of the town highlighting places that were part of Diderot's past, including the remains of the convent where his sister Angélique took her vows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diderot2013-langres.fr/|title=Club de trading IQ Option &amp; eToro Diderot - Club basé à Diderot Langres|website=diderot2013-langres.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 October 2013, a museum of the Enlightenment focusing on Diderot's contributions to the movement, the  [[Denis Diderot House Of Enlightenment (France)|Maison des Lumières Denis Diderot]], was inaugurated in Langres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://champagne-ardenne.france3.fr/diderot-2013-langres-en-fete|title=Diderot 2013, Langres en fête - France 3 Grand Est|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Directed evolution''' ('''DE''') is a method used in [[protein engineering]] that mimics the process of [[natural selection]] to steer [[proteins]] or [[nucleic acid]]s toward a user-defined goal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lutz S | title = Beyond directed evolution--semi-rational protein engineering and design | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 734–43 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20869867 | pmc = 2982887 | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2010.08.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of subjecting a [[gene]] to iterative rounds of [[mutagenesis]] (creating a library of variants), selection (expressing those variants and isolating members with the desired function), and amplification (generating a template for the next round). It can be performed ''[[in vivo]]''(in living organisms), or ''[[in vitro]]'' (in cells or free in solution). Directed evolution is used both for [[protein engineering]] as an alternative to rationally designing modified proteins, as well as studies of fundamental [[evolution|evolutionary principles]] in a controlled, laboratory environment.

== History ==

Early [[phage display]] techniques in the 1980s allowed targeting of mutations and selection to a single protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith GP | title = Filamentous fusion phage: novel expression vectors that display cloned antigens on the virion surface | journal = Science | volume = 228 | issue = 4705 | pages = 1315–7 | date = June 1985 | pmid = 4001944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled selection of enhanced [[binding protein]]s, but was not yet compatible with selection for catalytic activity of [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chen|first=Keqin|last2=Arnold|first2=Frances H. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1991|title=Enzyme Engineering for Nonaqueous Solvents: Random Mutagenesis to Enhance Activity of Subtilisin E in Polar Organic Media|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1191-1073|journal=Bio/Technology|language=En|volume=9|issue=11|pages=1073–1077|doi=10.1038/nbt1191-1073|issn=0733-222X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods to evolve enzymes were developed in the 1990s and brought the technique to a wider scientific audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Eun-Sung|date=2008-11-27|title=Directed Evolution: A Historical Exploration into an Evolutionary Experimental System of Nanobiotechnology, 1965–2006|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-008-9108-9|journal=Minerva|language=en|volume=46|issue=4|pages=463–484|doi=10.1007/s11024-008-9108-9|issn=0026-4695}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field rapidly expanded with new methods for making libraries of gene variants and for screening their activity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Packer MS, Liu DR | title = Methods for the directed evolution of proteins | language = En | journal = Nature Reviews.

==Principles==

[[File:DE landscape.png|thumb|left|300px|Directed evolution is analogous to climbing a hill on a '[[fitness landscape]]' where elevation represents the desired property. Each round of selection samples mutants on all sides of the starting template (1) and selects the mutant with the highest elevation, thereby climbing the hill. This is repeated until a local summit is reached (2).]]

Directed evolution is a mimic of the natural evolution cycle in a laboratory setting. Evolution requires three things to happen: [[Genetic diversity|variation]] between replicators, that the variation causes [[Fitness (biology)|fitness differences]] upon which selection acts, and that this variation is [[heritability|heritable]]. In DE, a single gene is evolved by iterative rounds of mutagenesis, selection or screening, and amplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Voigt CA, Kauffman S, Wang ZG | title = Rational evolutionary design: the theory of in vitro protein evolution | journal = Advances in Protein Chemistry | volume = 55 | pages = 79–160 | date = 2000 | pmid = 11050933 | doi = 10.1016/s0065-3233(01)55003-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rounds of these steps are typically repeated, using the best variant from one round as the template for the next to achieve stepwise improvements.

The likelihood of success in a directed evolution experiment is directly related to the total library size, as evaluating more mutants increases the chances of finding one with the desired properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalby PA | title = Strategy and success for the directed evolution of enzymes | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 473–80 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21684150 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2011.05.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generating variation===

[[File:DE Mutations.png|thumb|300px|Starting [[gene]] (left) and library of variants (right). [[Point mutations]] change single nucleotides. [[indel|Insertions and deletions]] add or remove sections of DNA. [[Genetic recombination|Shuffling]] recombines segments of two (or more) similar genes.]]

The first step in performing a cycle of directed evolution is the generation of a library of variant genes. The [[sequence space]] for random sequence is vast (10&lt;sup&gt;130&lt;/sup&gt; possible sequences for a 100 [[amino acid]] protein) and extremely sparsely populated by functional proteins. Neither experimental,&lt;ref name="Lipovsek D 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lipovsek D, Plückthun A | title = In-vitro protein evolution by ribosome display and mRNA display | journal = Journal of Immunological Methods | volume = 290 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 51–67 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15261571 | doi = 10.1016/j.jim.2004.04.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nor natural&lt;ref name="Dryden DT 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dryden DT, Thomson AR, White JH | title = How much of protein sequence space has been explored by life on Earth? | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 5 | issue = 25 | pages = 953–6 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18426772 | pmc = 2459213 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2008.0085 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2016}} evolution can ever get close to sampling so many sequences. Of course, natural evolution samples variant sequences close to functional protein sequences and this is imitated in DE by mutagenising an already functional gene.
Some calculations suggest it is entirely feasible that for all practical (i.e. functional and structural) purposes, protein sequence space has been fully explored during the course of evolution of life on Earth.&lt;ref name="Dryden DT 2008"/&gt;

The starting gene can be mutagenised by random [[point mutations]] (by chemical mutagens or error prone [[PCR]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuchner O, Arnold FH | title = Directed evolution of enzyme catalysts | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 523–30 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9418307 | doi = 10.1016/s0167-7799(97)01138-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sen S, Venkata Dasu V, Mandal B | title = Developments in directed evolution for improving enzyme functions | journal = Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology | volume = 143 | issue = 3 | pages = 212–23 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18057449 | doi = 10.1007/s12010-007-8003-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[indel|insertions and deletions]] (by transposons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones DD | title = Triplet nucleotide removal at random positions in a target gene: the tolerance of TEM-1 beta-lactamase to an amino acid deletion | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 33 | issue = 9 | pages = e80 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15897323 | pmc = 1129029 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gni077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic recombination|Gene recombination]] can be mimicked by [[DNA shuffling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stemmer WP | title = Rapid evolution of a protein in vitro by DNA shuffling | journal = Nature | volume = 370 | issue = 6488 | pages = 389–91 | date = August 1994 | pmid = 8047147 | doi = 10.1038/370389a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crameri A, Raillard SA, Bermudez E, Stemmer WP | title = DNA shuffling of a family of genes from diverse species accelerates directed evolution | journal = Nature | volume = 391 | issue = 6664 | pages = 288–91 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9440693 | doi = 10.1038/34663 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of several sequences (usually of more than 70% homology) to jump into regions of sequence space between the shuffled parent genes. Finally, specific regions of a gene can be systematically randomised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reetz MT, Carballeira JD | title = Iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM) for rapid directed evolution of functional enzymes | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 891–903 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17446890 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2007.72 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a more focused approach based on structure and function knowledge. Depending on the method, the library generated will vary in the [[Distribution of fitness effects|proportion of functional variants]] it contains. Even if an organism is used to express the gene of interest, by mutagenising only that gene, the rest of the organism’s genome remains the same and can be ignored for the evolution experiment (to the extent of providing a constant genetic environment).

===Detecting fitness differences===
The majority of [[mutation]]s are deleterious and so libraries of mutants tend to mostly have variants with reduced [[catalytic activity|activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartl DL | title = What can we learn from fitness landscapes? | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 21 | pages = 51–7 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25444121 | pmc = 4254422 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2014.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a high-throughput [[assay]] is vital for measuring activity to find the rare variants with beneficial mutations that improve the desired properties. Two main categories of method exist for isolating functional variants. '''Selection''' systems directly couple protein function to survival of the gene, whereas '''screening''' systems individually assay each variant and allow a quantitative threshold to be set for sorting a variant or population of variants of a desired activity. Both selection and screening can be performed in living cells (''in vivo'' evolution) or performed directly on the [[protein]] or [[RNA]] without any cells (''in vitro'' evolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Badran AH, Liu DR | title = In vivo continuous directed evolution | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 24 | pages = 1–10 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25461718 | pmc = 4308500 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2014.09.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar A, Singh S | title = Directed evolution: tailoring biocatalysts for industrial applications | journal = Critical Reviews in Biotechnology | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 365–78 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 22985113 | doi = 10.3109/07388551.2012.716810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During ''in vivo'' evolution, each cell (usually [[bacteria]] or [[yeast]]) is [[Transformation (genetics)|transformed]] with a [[plasmid]] containing a different member of the variant library. In this way, only the gene of interest differs between the cells, with all other genes being kept the same. The cells express the protein either in their [[cytoplasm]] or [[plasma membrane|surface]] where its function can be tested. This format has the advantage of selecting for properties in a cellular environment, which is useful when the evolved protein or RNA is to be used in living organisms. When performed without cells, DE involves using [[In vitro compartmentalization#In Vitro transcription.2Ftranslation|''in vitro'' transcription translation]] to produce proteins or RNA free in solution or compartmentalised in [[In vitro compartmentalization|artificial microdroplets]]. This method has the benefits of being more versatile in the selection conditions (e.g. temperature, solvent), and can express proteins that would be toxic to cells. Furthermore, ''in vitro'' evolution experiments can generate far larger libraries (up to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) because the library DNA need not be [[Transformation (genetics)|inserted]] into cells (often a limiting step).

====Selection====
Selection for [[Protein binding|binding activity]] is conceptually simple. The target molecule is immobilised on a solid support, a library of variant proteins is flowed over it, poor binders are washed away, and the remaining bound variants recovered to isolate their genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Willats WG | title = Phage display: practicalities and prospects | journal = Plant Molecular Biology | volume = 50 | issue = 6 | pages = 837–54 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12516857 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Binding of an enzyme to immobilised covalent [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] has been also used as an attempt to isolate active catalysts. This approach, however, only selects for single catalytic turnover and is not a good model of substrate binding or true substrate reactivity. If an enzyme activity can be made necessary for cell survival, either by synthesizing a vital metabolite, or destroying a toxin, then cell survival is a function of enzyme activity.&lt;ref name="Leemhuis H 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leemhuis H, Stein V, Griffiths AD, Hollfelder F | title = New genotype-phenotype linkages for directed evolution of functional proteins | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 472–8 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16043338 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2005.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verhoeven KD, Altstadt OC, Savinov SN | title = Intracellular detection and evolution of site-specific proteases using a genetic selection system | journal = Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology | volume = 166 | issue = 5 | pages = 1340–54 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22270548 | doi = 10.1007/s12010-011-9522-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such systems are generally only limited in throughput by the [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] efficiency of cells. They are also less expensive and labour-intensive than screening, however they are typically difficult to engineer, prone to artefacts and give no information on the [[Distribution of fitness effects|range of activities]] present in the library.

====Screening====
An alternative to selection is a screening system. Each variant gene is individually [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|expressed]] and [[assay]]ed to quantitatively measure the activity (most often by a [[Coloured|colourgenic]] or [[fluorogenic]] product). The variants are then ranked and the experimenter decides which variants to use as templates for the next round of DE. Even the most high throughput assays usually have lower coverage than selection methods but give the advantage of producing detailed information on each one of the screened variants. This disaggregated data can also be used to characterise the distribution of activities in libraries which is not possible in simple selection systems. Screening systems, therefore, have advantages when it comes to experimentally characterising adaptive evolution and fitness landscapes.

===Ensuring heredity===
[[File:DE Linkage.png|thumb|350px|An [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|expressed protein]] can either be [[covalent bond|covalently linked]] to its [[gene]] (as in [[mRNA]], left) or compartmentalized with it ([[Cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[Microfluidics|artificial compartments]], right). Either way ensures that the gene can be isolated based on the activity of the encoded protein.]]

When functional proteins have been isolated, it is necessary that their genes are too, therefore a [[heredity|genotype-phenotype]] link is required.&lt;ref name="Leemhuis H 2005"/&gt; This can be covalent, such as [[mRNA display]] where the [[mRNA]] gene is linked to the protein at the end of translation by puromycin.&lt;ref name="Lipovsek D 2004"/&gt; Alternatively the protein and its gene can be co-localised by compartmentalisation in living cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen AW, Daugherty PS | title = Evolutionary optimization of fluorescent proteins for intracellular FRET | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 355–60 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15696158 | doi = 10.1038/nbt1066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or emulsion droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schaerli Y, Hollfelder F | title = The potential of microfluidic water-in-oil droplets in experimental biology | journal = Molecular bioSystems | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 1392–404 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20023716 | doi = 10.1039/b907578j }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene sequences isolated are then amplified by PCR or by transformed host bacteria. Either the single best sequence, or a pool of sequences can be used as the template for the next round of mutagenesis. The repeated cycles of Diversification-Selection-Amplification generate protein variants adapted to the applied selection pressures.

==Comparison to rational protein design==

===Advantages of directed evolution===
[[Protein design|Rational design]] of a protein relies on an in-depth knowledge of the [[protein structure]], as well as its [[catalytic mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marshall SA, Lazar GA, Chirino AJ, Desjarlais JR | title = Rational design and engineering of therapeutic proteins | journal = Drug Discovery Today | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 212–21 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12634013 | doi = 10.1016/s1359-6446(03)02610-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson CJ | title = Rational protein design: developing next-generation biological therapeutics and nanobiotechnological tools | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Nanomedicine and Nanobiotechnology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 330–41 | date = 27 October 2014 | pmid = 25348497 | doi = 10.1002/wnan.1310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific changes are then made by [[site-directed mutagenesis]] in an attempt to change the function of the protein. A drawback of this is that even when the structure and mechanism of action of the protein are well known, the change due to mutation is still difficult to predict. Therefore, an advantage of DE is that there is no need to understand the mechanism of the desired activity or how mutations would affect it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giger L, Caner S, Obexer R, Kast P, Baker D, Ban N, Hilvert D | title = Evolution of a designed retro-aldolase leads to complete active site remodeling | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 494–8 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23748672 | pmc = 3720730 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.1276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations of directed evolution===
A restriction of directed evolution is that a high-throughput assay is required in order to measure the effects of a large number of different random mutations. This can require extensive research and development before it can be used for directed evolution. Additionally, such assays are often highly specific to monitoring a particular activity and so are not transferable to new DE experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bornscheuer UT, Pohl M | title = Improved biocatalysts by directed evolution and rational protein design | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–43 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11282339 | doi = 10.1016/s1367-5931(00)00182-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, selecting for improvement in the assayed function simply generates improvements in the assayed function. To understand how these improvements are achieved, the properties of the evolving enzyme have to be measured. Improvement of the assayed activity can be due to improvements in enzyme catalytic activity or enzyme concentration. There is also no guarantee that improvement on one substrate will improve activity on another. This is particularly important when the desired activity cannot be directly screened or selected for and so a ‘proxy’ substrate is used. DE can lead to evolutionary specialisation to the proxy without improving the desired activity. Consequently, choosing appropriate screening or selection conditions is vital for successful DE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52400248|title=Directed enzyme evolution: screening and selection methods|last=Arnold|first=Frances|last2=Georgiou|first2=George|date=2003|publisher=Humana Press|others=|year=|isbn=9781588292865|location=Totowa, N.J.|pages=|oclc=52400248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinatorial approaches===
Combined, 'semi-rational' approaches are being investigated to address the limitations of both rational design and directed evolution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldsmith M 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldsmith M, Tawfik DS | title = Directed enzyme evolution: beyond the low-hanging fruit | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 406–12 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22579412 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2012.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beneficial mutations are rare, so large numbers of random mutants have to be screened to find improved variants. 'Focused libraries' concentrate on randomising regions thought to be richer in beneficial mutations for the mutagenesis step of DE. A focused library contains fewer variants than a traditional random mutagenesis library and so does not require such high-throughput screening.

Creating a focused library requires some knowledge of which residues in the structure to mutate. For example, knowledge of the [[active site]] of an enzyme may allow just the residues known to interact with the  [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]] to be randomised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen MM, Snow CD, Vizcarra CL, Mayo SL, Arnold FH | title = Comparison of random mutagenesis and semi-rational designed libraries for improved cytochrome P450 BM3-catalyzed hydroxylation of small alkanes | journal = Protein Engineering, Design &amp; Selection | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 171–8 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22334757 | doi = 10.1093/protein/gzs004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Acevedo-Rocha CG, Hoebenreich S, Reetz MT | title = Iterative saturation mutagenesis: a powerful approach to engineer proteins by systematically simulating Darwinian evolution | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 1179 | pages = 103–28 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25055773 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4939-1053-3_7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, knowledge of which protein regions are [[Segregating site|variable]] in nature can guide mutagenesis in just those regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jochens H, Bornscheuer UT | title = Natural diversity to guide focused directed evolution | journal = Chembiochem | volume = 11 | issue = 13 | pages = 1861–6 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20680978 | doi = 10.1002/cbic.201000284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jochens H, Aerts D, Bornscheuer UT | title = Thermostabilization of an esterase by alignment-guided focussed directed evolution | journal = Protein Engineering, Design &amp; Selection | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages = 903–9 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20947674 | doi = 10.1093/protein/gzq071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dysteleology''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view that [[existence]] has no ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' - no [[Four causes|final cause]] from purposeful [[design]]. [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834-1919) invented and popularized the word "dysteleology"&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Dysteleology is an aggressive, yet optimistic, form of science-oriented [[atheism]]{{cn|date=October 2018}} originally perhaps{{or|date=October 2018}} associated with Haeckel and his followers, but now perhaps more associated{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} with the type of atheism of [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], or [[Christopher Hitchens]]. Transcending traditional philosophical and religious perspectives, such as [[German idealism]] (including the philosophies of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]) and contemporary [[New Age]] thinking, [[Modernism|modern]] [[philosophical naturalism]] sees existence as having no inherent goal.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

'''Dōgen Zenji''' (道元禅師; 19 January 1200&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 22 September 1253), also known as '''Dōgen Kigen''' (道元希玄), '''Eihei Dōgen''' (永平道元), '''Kōso Jōyō Daishi''' (高祖承陽大師), or '''Busshō Dentō Kokushi''' (仏性伝東国師), was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] priest, writer, poet, philosopher, and founder of the [[Sōtō]] school of Zen in Japan.

Originally ordained as a monk in the [[Tendai|Tendai School]] in [[Kyoto]], he was ultimately dissatisfied with its teaching and traveled to China to seek out what he believed to be a more authentic Buddhism. He remained there for five years, finally training under [[Tiantong Rujing]], an eminent teacher of the Chinese [[Caodong]] lineage. Upon his return to Japan, he began promoting the practice of [[zazen]] (sitting meditation) through literary works such as ''[[Fukan zazengi]]'' and ''[[Bendōwa]]''.

He eventually broke relations completely with the powerful Tendai School, and, after several years of likely friction between himself and the establishment, left [[Kyoto]] for the mountainous countryside where he founded the monastery [[Eihei-ji]], which remains the head temple of the Sōtō school today.

Dōgen is known for his extensive writing including his most famous work, the collection of 95 essays called the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]'', but also ''[[Eihei Kōroku]]'', a collection of his talks, poetry, and commentaries, and ''[[Eihei Shingi]]'', the first Zen monastic code written in Japan, among others.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Dōgen was probably born into a noble family, though as an illegitimate child of [[Minamoto no Michitomo|Minamoto Michitomo]], who served in the [[Imperial court in Kyoto|imperial court]] as a high-ranking {{nihongo|''ashō''|亞相||"Councillor of State"}}.&lt;ref name="Bodiford_22_36"&gt;{{harvp|Bodiford|2008|pp=22–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother is said to have died when Dōgen was age 7.

===Early training===
At some later point, Dōgen became a low-ranking monk on [[Mount Hiei]], the headquarters of the [[Tendai|Tendai school]] of Buddhism. According to the ''Kenzeiki'' (建撕記), he became possessed by a single question with regard to the Tendai doctrine:
{{quote|As I study both the exoteric and the esoteric schools of Buddhism, they maintain that human beings are endowed with [[Buddha-nature|Dharma-nature]] by birth. If this is the case, why did the [[Buddha (general)|Buddhas]] of all ages — undoubtedly in possession of [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] — find it necessary to seek enlightenment and engage in spiritual practice?&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bodiford|2008|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ōkubo|1966|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This question was, in large part, prompted by the Tendai concept of [[Hongaku|original enlightenment]] (本覚 ''hongaku''), which states that all human beings are enlightened by nature and that, consequently, any notion of achieving enlightenment through practice is fundamentally flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Abe|1992|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kenzeiki'' further states that he found no answer to his question at Mount Hiei, and that he was disillusioned by the internal politics and need for social prominence for advancement.&lt;ref name="Bodiford_22_36"/&gt; Therefore, Dōgen left to seek an answer from other Buddhist masters. He went to visit Kōin, the Tendai abbot of [[Mii-dera|Onjō-ji Temple]] (園城寺), asking him this same question. Kōin said that, in order to find an answer, he might want to consider studying [[Chán]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;Tanahashi 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1217, two years after the death of contemporary Zen Buddhist [[Myōan Eisai]], Dōgen went to study at [[Kennin-ji|Kennin-ji Temple]] (建仁寺), under Eisai's successor, Myōzen (明全).&lt;ref name="Bodiford_22_36"/&gt;

===Travel to China===
In 1223, Dōgen and Myōzen undertook the dangerous passage across the [[East China Sea]] to [[Song Dynasty|China]] to study in Jing-de-si (Ching-te-ssu, 景德寺) monastery as Eisai had once done.

In China, Dōgen first went to the leading Chan monasteries in [[Zhejiang|Zhèjiāng province]]. At the time, most Chan teachers based their training around the use of ''[[Koan|gōng-àn]]''s (Japanese: ''kōan''). Though Dōgen assiduously studied the kōans, he became disenchanted with the heavy emphasis laid upon them, and wondered why the sutras were not studied more. At one point, owing to this disenchantment, Dōgen even refused Dharma transmission from a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Tanahashi p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1225, he decided to visit a master named [[Rújìng]] (如淨; J. Nyōjo), the thirteenth patriarch of the [[Caodong|Cáodòng]] (J. Sōtō) lineage of Zen Buddhism, at Mount Tiāntóng (天童山 ''Tiāntóngshān''; J. Tendōzan) in [[Ningbo|Níngbō]]. Rujing was reputed to have a style of Chan that was different from the other masters whom Dōgen had thus far encountered.  In later writings, Dōgen referred to Rujing as "the Old Buddha".  Additionally he affectionately described both Rujing and Myōzen as {{nihongo|''senshi''|先師||"Ancient Teacher"}}.&lt;ref name="Bodiford_22_36"/&gt;

Under Rujing, Dōgen realized liberation of body and mind upon hearing the master say, "Cast off body and mind" (身心脱落 ''shēn xīn tuō luò''). This phrase would continue to have great importance to Dōgen throughout his life, and can be found scattered throughout his writings, as—for example—in a famous section of his "[[Genjōkōan]]" (現成公案):
{{quote|To study the Way is to study the Self. To study the Self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things of the universe. To be enlightened by all things of the universe is to cast off the body and mind of the self as well as those of others. Even the traces of enlightenment are wiped out, and life with traceless enlightenment goes on forever and ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kim|2004|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Myōzen died shortly after Dōgen arrived at Mount Tiantong. In 1227,&lt;ref&gt;Tanahashi 6&lt;/ref&gt; Dōgen received [[Dharma transmission]] and ''[[Dharma transmission|inka]]'' from Rujing, and remarked on how he had finally settled his "life's quest of the great matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tanahashi|2005|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Japan===
[[File:Dogen.jpg|thumb|upright|Dōgen watching the moon. [[Hōkyōji monastery]], Fukui prefecture, circa 1250.]]

Dōgen returned to Japan in 1227 or 1228, going back to stay at Kennin-ji, where he had trained previously.&lt;ref name="Bodiford_22_36"/&gt; Among his first actions upon returning was to write down the ''Fukan Zazengi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/gongyo_seiten/translations/part_3/fukan_zazengi.html|title=Fukan zazengi|website=www.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (普観坐禅儀; "Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen"), a short text emphasizing the importance of and giving instructions for ''[[zazen]],'' or sitting [[meditation]].

However, tension soon arose as the Tendai community began taking steps to suppress both Zen and [[Jodo Shinshu|Jōdo Shinshū]], the new forms of Buddhism in Japan. In the face of this tension, Dōgen left the Tendai dominion of Kyōto in 1230, settling instead in an abandoned temple in what is today the city of [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]], south of Kyōto.&lt;ref&gt;Tanahashi 39&lt;/ref&gt; In 1233, Dōgen founded the Kannon-dōri-in&lt;ref&gt;Tanahashi 7&lt;/ref&gt; in Fukakusa as a small center of practice. He later expanded this temple into [[Kōshōhōrin-ji]] (興聖法林寺).

===Eihei-ji===
In 1243, [[Hatano clan|Hatano Yoshishige]] (波多野義重) offered to relocate Dōgen's community to [[Echizen Province|Echizen province]], far to the north of Kyōto. Dōgen accepted because of the ongoing tension with the Tendai community, and the growing competition of the Rinzai-school.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin_2005b_62"&gt;{{harvp|Dumoulin|2005b|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His followers built a comprehensive center of practice there, calling it Daibutsu Temple (Daibutsu-ji, 大仏寺). While the construction work was going on, Dōgen would live and teach at Yoshimine-dera Temple (Kippō-ji, 吉峯寺), which is located close to Daibutsu-ji. During his stay at Kippō-ji, Dōgen "fell into a depression".&lt;ref name="Dumoulin_2005b_62"/&gt; It marked a turning point in his life, giving way to "rigorous critique of Rinzai Zen".&lt;ref name="Dumoulin_2005b_62"/&gt; He criticized [[Dahui Zonggao]], the most influential figure of [[Song Dynasty]] Chán.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McRae|2003|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1246, Dōgen renamed Daibutsu-ji, calling it [[Eihei-ji]]. This temple remains one of the two head temples of Sōtō Zen in Japan today, the other being [[Sōji-ji]].

Dōgen spent the remainder of his life teaching and writing at Eihei-ji. In 1247, the newly installed [[Shikken|shōgun's regent]], [[Hōjō Tokiyori]], invited Dōgen to come to [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] to teach him. Dōgen made the rather long journey east to provide the shōgun with lay ordination, and then returned to Eihei-ji in 1248. In the autumn of 1252, Dōgen fell ill, and soon showed no signs of recovering. He presented his robes to his main apprentice, Koun Ejō (孤雲懐弉), making him the abbot of Eihei-ji.

===Death===
At Hatano Yoshishige's invitation, Dōgen left for Kyōto in search of a remedy for his illness. In 1253, soon after arriving in Kyōto, Dōgen died. Shortly before his death, he had written a [[death poem]]:

:Fifty-four years lighting up the sky.
:A quivering leap smashes a billion worlds.
:Hah!
:Entire body looks for nothing.
:Living, I plunge into Yellow Springs.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tanahashi, 219&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==

===Zazen===
Dōgen often stressed the critical importance of [[zazen]], or sitting meditation as the central practice of Buddhism. He considered zazen to be identical to studying Zen. This is pointed out clearly in the first sentence of the 1243 instruction manual ''"Zazen-gi"'' (坐禪儀; "Principles of Zazen"): "Studying Zen ... is zazen".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/pdf/Zazengi%20translation.pdf Principles of Zazen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216154448/http://stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/pdf/Zazengi%20translation.pdf |date=16 December 2015 }}; tr. Bielefeldt, Carl.&lt;/ref&gt; Dōgen taught zazen to everyone, even for the laity, male or female and including all social classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dumoulin|2005b|loc=Section 2, "Dogen" pp. 51-119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In referring to zazen, Dōgen is most often referring specifically to ''[[shikantaza]]'', roughly translatable as "nothing but precisely sitting", or "just sitting," which is a kind of sitting meditation in which the meditator sits "in a state of brightly alert attention that is free of thoughts, directed to no object, and attached to no particular content".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kohn|1991|pp=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Fukan Zazengi'', Dōgen wrote:

{{quote|For zazen, a quiet room is suitable. Eat and drink moderately. Cast aside all involvements and cease all affairs. Do not think good or bad. Do not administer pros and cons. Cease all the movements of the conscious mind, the gauging of all thoughts and views. Have no designs on becoming a Buddha. Zazen has nothing whatever to do with sitting or lying down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fukanzazengi: Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen|url=http://www.zenheartsangha.org/sutras/Fukanzazengi.pdf|publisher=Zen Heart Sangha}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dōgen called this zazen practice "without thinking" (''hi-shiryo'') in which one is simply aware of things as they are, beyond thinking and not-thinking - the active effort not to think.

The correct mental attitude for zazen according to Dōgen is one of effortless non-striving, this is because for Dōgen, enlightenment is already always present.

Further, Dōgen frequently distanced himself from more syncretic Buddhist practices at the time, including those of his contemporary [[Eisai]].  In the [[Bendowa]], Dōgen writes:&lt;ref name="collcutt"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = collcutt | first1 = Martin | title = Five Mountains: The Rinzai Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan | publisher = Harvard University Asia Center | year = 1996 | isbn = 0674304985 | pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Commitment to Zen is casting off body and mind.  You have no need for incense offerings, homage praying, [[nembutsu]], penance disciplines, or silent sutra readings; just sit single-mindedly.}}

===Oneness of practice-enlightenment===
The primary concept underlying Dōgen's Zen practice is "oneness of practice-enlightenment" (修證一如 ''shushō-ittō'' / ''shushō-ichinyo'').

For Dōgen, the practice of zazen and the experience of enlightenment were one and the same. This point was succinctly stressed by Dōgen in the ''Fukan Zazengi'', the first text that he composed upon his return to Japan from China: 
{{quote|To practice the Way singleheartedly is, in itself, enlightenment. There is no gap between practice and enlightenment or zazen and daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Yukoi 47&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Earlier in the same text, the basis of this identity is explained in more detail:
{{quote|Zazen is not "step-by-step meditation". Rather it is simply the easy and pleasant practice of a Buddha, the realization of the Buddha's Wisdom. The Truth appears, there being no [[Maya (illusion)|delusion]]. If you understand this, you are completely free, like a dragon that has obtained water or a tiger that reclines on a mountain. The [[Dharma (Buddhism)|supreme Law]] will then appear of itself, and you will be free of weariness and confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Yukoi 46&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "oneness of practice-enlightenment" was also a point stressed in the ''[[Bendōwa]]'' (弁道話 "A Talk on the Endeavor of the Path") of 1231:
{{quote|Thinking that practice and enlightenment are not one is no more than a view that is outside the Way. In buddha-dharma [i.e. Buddhism], practice and enlightenment are one and the same. Because it is the practice of enlightenment, a beginner's wholehearted practice of the Way is exactly the totality of original enlightenment. For this reason, in conveying the essential attitude for practice, it is taught not to wait for enlightenment outside practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Okumura|1997|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Buddha-nature===
For Dōgen, [[Buddha-nature]] or ''Busshō'' (佛性) is the nature of reality and all [[Being]]. In the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]'', Dōgen writes that "whole-being is the Buddha-nature" and that even inanimate things (grass, trees, etc.) are an expression of Buddha-nature. He rejected any view that saw Buddha-nature as a permanent, substantial inner self or ground. Dōgen held that Buddha-nature was "vast emptiness", "the world of becoming" and that "impermanence is in itself Buddha-nature".&lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin 82, 85&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dōgen:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, the very impermanency of grass and tree, thicket and forest is the Buddha nature. The very impermanency of men and things, body and mind, is the Buddha nature. Nature and lands, mountains and rivers, are impermanent because they are the Buddha nature. Supreme and complete enlightenment, because it is impermanent, is the Buddha nature.&lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Time-Being===
Dōgen's conception of Time-Being (''Uji'', 有時) is an essential element of his metaphysics in the ''Shōbōgenzō''. According to the traditional interpretation, "''Uji''" here means time itself is being, and all being is time."&lt;ref&gt;"Uji: The Time-Being by Eihei Dogen" Translated by Dan Welch and Kazuaki Tanahashi from: ''The Moon in a Dewdrop; writings of Zen Master Dogen''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uji'' is all the changing and dynamic activities that exist as the flow of becoming, all beings in the entire world are time.&lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin 89&lt;/ref&gt; The two terms are thus spoken of concurrently to emphasize that the things are not to be viewed as separate concepts. Moreover, the aim is to not abstract time and being as rational concepts. This view has been developed by scholars such as [[Steven Heine]],&lt;ref&gt;Existential and Ontological Dimensions of Time in Heidegger and Dogen, SUNY Press, Albany 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Stambaugh]]&lt;ref&gt;Impermanence is Buddha-Nature: Dogen's Understanding of Temporality, University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and others and has served as a motivation to compare Dōgen's work to that of Martin Heidegger's "[[Dasein]]".{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Recently, however, [[Rein Raud]] has argued that this view is not correct and that Dōgen asserts that all existence is momentary, showing that such a reading would make quite a few of the rather cryptic passages in the ''Shōbōgenzō'' quite lucid.&lt;ref&gt;Raud, Rein. "The Existential Moment: Re-reading Dōgen's theory of time". ''Philosophy East and West'', vol.62 No.2, April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfect expression===
Another essential element of Dōgen's 'performative' metaphysics is his conception of Perfect expression (''Dōtoku'', 道得).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kim (2004) and more systematically based on a theory of symbols Müller (2013); reviewed by Steffen Döll in ''[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_east_and_west/summary/v065/65.2.doll.html Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 65'', Number 2 April 2015 636–639].&lt;/ref&gt; "While a radically critical view on language as soteriologically inefficient, if not positively harmful, is what Zen Buddhism is famous for,"&lt;ref&gt;Döll (2015), p. 637&lt;/ref&gt; it{{Clarify|reason=what can be argued?|date=September 2018}} can be argued "'within the framework of a rational theory of language, against an obscurantist interpretation of Zen that time and again invokes experience.'"&lt;ref&gt;Müller (2013), p. 25 cited after Döll (2015), p. 637&lt;/ref&gt; Dōgen distinguishes two types of language: monji 文字, the first, – after Ernst Cassirer – "discursive type that constantly structures our experiences and—more fundamentally—in fact produces the world we experience in the first place"; and dōtoku 道得, the second, "presentative type, which takes a holistic stance and establishes the totality of significations through a texture of relations.".&lt;ref&gt;Döll (2015), 637, cf. Müller (2013), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; As Döll points out, "It is this second type, as Müller holds, that allows for a positive view of language even from the radically skeptical perspective of Dōgen’s brand of Zen Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;Döll (2015), p. 637.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of Rinzai===
Dōgen was sometimes critical of the [[Rinzai school]] for their formulaic and intellectual koan practice (such as the practice of the ''Shiryoken'' or "Four Discernments")&lt;ref name="Dumoulin_65"&gt;Dumoulin 65&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for their disregard for the sutras:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recently in the great Sung dynasty of China there are many who call themselves "Zen masters". They do not know the length and breadth of the Buddha-Dharma. They have heard and seen but little. They memorize two or three sayings of [[Linji Yixuan|Lin Chi]] and [[Yun Men]] and think this is the whole way of the Buddha-Dharma. If the Dharma of the Buddha could be condensed in two or three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men, it would not have been transmitted to the present day. One can hardly say that Lin Chi and Yun Men are the Venerable ones of the Buddha-Dharma.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin_65"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dōgen was also very critical of the Japanese Daruma school of [[Dainichi Nonin|Dainichi Nōnin]].

===Virtues===
Dogen's perspective of virtue is discussed in the ''Shōbōgenzō'' text as something to be practiced inwardly so that it will manifest itself on the outside. In other words, virtue is something that is both internal and external in the sense that one can practice internal good dispositions and also the expression of these good dispositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mikkelson|first1=Douglas|title=TOWARD A DESCRIPTION OF DOGEN’S ¯ MORAL VIRTUES|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics|date=2006|volume=34|issue=2|pages=225–251 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.proxylib.csueastbay.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5bb56d2a-96d6-4277-98cd-48850eb7123e%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=123|accessdate=15 July 2014|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9795.2006.00267.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
[[File:Fukan Zazengi.jpg|thumb|Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen (普勧坐禅儀, ''fukan zazengi'')]]

While it was customary for Buddhist works to be written in Chinese, Dōgen often wrote in Japanese, conveying the essence of his thought in a style that was at once concise, compelling, and inspiring. A master stylist, Dōgen is noted not only for his prose, but also for his poetry (in Japanese ''[[Waka (poetry)|waka]]'' style and various Chinese styles). Dōgen's use of language is unconventional by any measure. According to Dōgen scholar [[Steven Heine]]: "Dogen's poetic and philosophical works are characterized by a continual effort to express the inexpressible by perfecting imperfectable speech through the creative use of wordplay, neologism, and lyricism, as well as the recasting of traditional expressions".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heine|1997|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shōbōgenzō===
Dōgen's masterpiece is the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]'', talks and writings collected together in ninety-five [[Fascicle (book)|fascicle]]s. The topics range from monastic practice, to the equality of women and men, to the philosophy of language, being, and time. In the work, as in his own life, Dōgen emphasized the absolute primacy of ''shikantaza'' and the inseparability of practice and enlightenment.

===Shinji Shōbōgenzō===
Dōgen also compiled a collection of 301 koans in Chinese without commentaries added. Often called the ''[[Shinji Shōbōgenzō]]'' (''shinji'': "original or true characters" and ''shōbōgenzō'', variously translated as "the right-dharma-eye treasury" or "Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma"). The collection is also known as the ''Shōbōgenzō Sanbyakusoku'' (The Three Hundred Verse Shōbōgenzō") and the ''Mana Shōbōgenzō'', where ''mana'' is an alternative reading of ''shinji''. The exact date the book was written is in dispute but Nishijima believes that Dogen may well have begun compiling the koan collection before his trip to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|2003|p=i}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these stories are commonly referred to as ''kōans'', Dōgen referred to them as ''kosoku'' (ancestral criteria) or ''innen'' (circumstances and causes or results, of a story). The word ''kōan'' for Dogen meant "absolute reality" or the "universal Dharma".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Yasutani|1996|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eihei Kōroku, Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki===
Lectures that Dōgen gave to his monks at his monastery, [[Eihei-ji]], were compiled under the title ''[[Eihei Kōroku]]'', also known as ''Dōgen Oshō Kōroku'' (The Extensive Record of Teacher Dōgen’s Sayings) in ten volumes. The sermons, lectures, sayings and poetry were compiled shortly after Dōgen’s death by his main disciples, [[Koun Ejō]] (孤雲懐奘, 1198–1280), Senne, and Gien. There are three different editions of this text: the Rinnō-ji text from 1598, a popular version printed in 1672, and a version discovered at Eihei-ji in 1937, which, although undated, is believed to be the oldest extant version.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kim|1987|pp=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another collection of his talks is the ''[[Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki]]'' (Gleanings from Master Dōgen’s Sayings) in six volumes. These are talks that Dōgen gave to his leading disciple, Ejō, who became Dōgen’s disciple in 1234. The talks were recorded and edited by Ejō.

===Hōkojōki===
The earliest work by Dōgen is the ''Hōkojōki'' (Memoirs of the Hōkyō Period). This one volume work is a collection of questions and answers between Dōgen and his Chinese teacher, Tiāntóng [[Rújìng]] (天童如淨; Japanese: Tendō Nyojō, 1162–1228).  The work was discovered among Dōgen’s papers by Ejō in 1253, just three months after Dōgen’s death.

===Other writings===
Other notable writings of Dōgen are:
* ''Fukan-zazengi'' (普勧坐禅儀, General Advice on the Principles of Zazen), one volume; probably written immediately after Dōgen’s return from China in 1227.
* ''[[Bendōwa]]'' (弁道話, "On the Endeavor of the Way"), written in 1231. This represents one of Dōgen's earliest writings and asserts the superiority of the practice of shikantaza through a series of questions and answers. 
* ''Eihei shoso gakudō-yōjinshū'' (Advice on Studying the Way), one volume; probably written in 1234.
* ''[[Tenzo kyōkun]]'' (Instructions to the Chief Cook), one volume; written in 1237.
* ''Bendōhō'' (Rules for the Practice of the Way), one volume; written between 1244 and 1246.&lt;ref&gt;See Kim (1987), Appendix B, pp. 234–237, for a more complete list of Dōgen's major writings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shushō-gi===
The concept of oneness of practice-enlightenment is considered so fundamental to Dōgen's variety of Zen — and, consequently, to the Sōtō school as a whole — that it formed the basis for the work ''Shushō-gi'' (修證儀), which was compiled in 1890 by Takiya Takushū (滝谷卓洲) of Eihei-ji and Azegami Baisen (畔上楳仙) of Sōji-ji as an introductory and prescriptive abstract of Dōgen's massive work, the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]'' ("Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma").

==Lineage==
Though Dogen emphasised the importance of the correct transmission of the Buddha dharma, as guaranteed by the line of transmission from Shakyamuni, his own transmission became problematic in the [[Sandai sōron|third generation]]. In 1267 Ejō retired as Abbot of Eihei-ji, giving way to Gikai, who was already favored by Dōgen. Gikai introduced esoteric elements into the practice. Opposition arose, and in 1272 Ejō resumed the position of abbot. Following Ejō's death in 1280, Gikai became abbot again, strengthened by the support of the military for magical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dumoulin|2005b|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition arose again, and Gikai was forced to leave Eihei-ji. He was succeeded by Gien, who was first trained in the Daruma-school of [[Nōnin]]. His supporters designated him as the third abbot, rejecting the legitimacy of Gien.

* [[Koun Ejō]], commentator on the ''Shōbōgenzō'', and former [[Darumashū]] elder
** [[Giin]], through Ejō
** [[Gikai]], through Ejō
*** [[Keizan]]
** Gien, through Ejō
* [[Senne]], another commentator of the ''Shōbōgenzō''.

[[Jakuen]], a student of Rujing, who traced his lineage "directly back the Zen of the Song period",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dumoulin|2005b|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; established [[Hōkyō-ji]], where a strict style of Zen was practised. Students of his played a role in the conflict between Giin and Gikai.

A notable successor of Dogen was [[Keizan]] (瑩山; 1268–1325), founder of [[Sōji-ji|Sōji-ji Temple]] and author of the ''Record of the Transmission of Light'' (傳光錄 ''[[Denkoroku|Denkōroku]]''), which traces the succession of Zen masters from [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]] up to Keizan's own day. Together, Dōgen and Keizan are regarded as the founders of the Sōtō school in Japan.

The '''theory of facilitated variation''' demonstrates how seemingly complex biological systems can arise through a limited number of regulatory genetic changes, through the differential re-use of pre-existing developmental components.&lt;ref name="Kirschner2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirschner|first1=Marc W.|last2=Gerhart|first2=John C.|title=The plausibility of life : resolving Darwin's dilemma|date=2005|publisher=Yale Univ.

Kirschner]] (a professor and chair at the Department of Systems Biology, [[Harvard Medical School]]) and John C. Gerhart (a professor at the Graduate School, [[University of California, Berkeley]]).

The theory of facilitated variation addresses the nature and function of phenotypic variation in [[evolution]]. Recent advances in [[cell biology|cellular]] and [[evolutionary developmental biology]]  shed light on a number of mechanisms for generating novelty. Most anatomical and physiological traits that have evolved since the Cambrian are, according to Kirschner and Gerhart, the result of regulatory changes in the usage of various conserved core components that function in development and physiology.&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt; Novel traits arise as novel packages of modular core components, which requires modest genetic change in regulatory elements. The modularity and adaptability of developmental systems reduces the number of regulatory changes needed to generate adaptive phenotypic variation, increases the probability that genetic mutation will be viable, and allows organisms to respond flexibly to novel environments. In this manner, the conserved core processes facilitate the generation of adaptive phenotypic variation, which natural selection subsequently propagates.&lt;ref name="Kirschner2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt;

==Description of the theory==
The theory of facilitated variation consists of several elements.&lt;ref name="Kirschner2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt; Organisms are built from a set of highly conserved modules called "core processes" that function in development and physiology, and have remained largely unchanged for millions (in some instances billions) of years. Genetic mutation leads to regulatory changes in the package of core components (i.e. new combinations, amounts, and functional states of those components) exhibited by an organism. Finally, the altered combinations, amounts, and states of the conserved components function to develop and operate a new trait on which natural selection acts. Because of their modular organization, adaptability (e.g. arising through exploratory processes) and compartmentation, developmental systems tend to produce facilitated (i.e. functional and adaptive) phenotypic variation when challenged by genetic mutation or novel environmental conditions.

===Conserved core components===
Animals are built from a tool kit of components (e.g. like lego bricks). Most of the core components are conserved across diverse phyla of the animal kingdom. Examples of core components are:
* DNA replication, 
* DNA transcription to RNA, 
* translation of RNA to protein,
* formation of microfilament and microtubule cytoskeletons, 
* cell–cell signaling pathways,
* cell adhesion processes, 
* anteroposterior axis formation 

Additional core processes, such as appendage and limb formation in arthropods and tetrapods, respectively, are combinations of different conserved core processes linked in new regulatory configurations, and conserved in their entirety. 

===Weak regulatory linkage===
Different core processes become linked, through differential regulation, in different combinations, and operate in different amounts, states, times, and places, to generate new anatomical and physiological traits. These regulatory linkages can be made and changed easily, a phenomenon that Kirschner and Gerhart call “weak regulatory linkage”. Regulatory signals can switch on and off the core components to elicit complex responses. Although the signal seems to control the response, typically the responding core process can produce the output by itself but inhibits itself from doing so. All the signal does is interferes with this self-inhibition. Regulatory change is easily effected because conserved core processes have switch-like behavior and alternative outputs already built into them, which means that regulation does not need to coevolve with the functional output. 

===Exploratory processes===
Some conserved core processes, called "exploratory processes", have the ability to generate many different phenotypical outcomes or states. Examples include:
* the formation of microtubule structures, 
* the development of the nervous system (i.e. connecting of axons and target organs), 
* synapse elimination, 
* muscle patterning, 
* the production of blood vessels, 
* vertebrate immune system, 
* animal learning

Exploratory processes first generate a very large amount of physiological variation, often at random, and then select or stabilize the most useful ones, with the rest disappearing or dying back. Hence, exploratory processes resemble a Darwinian process operating during development. 

For example, as the vascular system develops, blood vessels expand to regions with insufficient oxygen supply. There is no predetermined genetically specified map for the distribution of blood vessels in the body, but the [[vascular system]] responds to signals from hypoxic tissues, whilst unrequired vessels in well-oxygenated tissues die back. Exploratory processes are powerful because they provide organisms with a tremendous scope for [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]].

===Compartmentation===
Ancient regulatory processes (evolved in pre-Cambrian animals) allow the re-use of core processes in different combinations, amounts, and states in some regions of the body, or certain times in development, while decreasing their chances of generating disruptive or maladaptive pleiotropic effects elsewhere in the organism. Spatial compartmentation of transcriptional regulation and cell–cell signaling are examples. The vertebrate embryo is organized spatially into perhaps 200 compartments, each uniquely defined by its expression of one or a few key genes encoding transcription factors or signaling molecules. An example of compartmentation is found in the developing spine: all vertebrae contain bone-forming cells, but those in the chest form ribs, whereas those in the neck do not, because they arose in different compartments (expressing different [[Hox genes]]). Other forms of regulatory compartmentation include different cell types, developmental stages, and sexes.

==Example: evolution of the wing==
Gerhart and Kirschner&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt; give the example of the evolution of a bird or bat wing from a tetrapod forelimb. They explain how, if bones undergo regulatory change in length and thickness as a result of genetic mutation, the muscles, nerves and vasculature will accommodate to those changes without themselves requiring independent regulatory change.  Studies of limb development show that muscle, nerve, and vascular founder cells originate in the embryonic trunk and migrate into the developing limb bud, which initially contains only bone and dermis precursors. Muscle precursors are adaptable; they receive signals from developing dermis and bone and take positions relative to them, wherever they are. Then, as noted previously, axons in large numbers extend into the bud from the nerve cord; some fortuitously contact muscle targets and are stabilized, and the rest shrink back. Finally, vascular progenitors enter. Wherever limb cells are hypoxic, they secrete signals that trigger nearby blood vessels to grow into their vicinity. Because of the adaptability conferred by exploratory processes, the co-evolution of bones, muscles, nerves and blood vessels is not required. Selection does not have to coordinate multiple independently varying parts. This not only means that viable phenotypes can easily be generated with little genetic change, but also that genetic mutations are less likely to be lethal, that large phenotypic changes can be favored by selection, and that phenotypic variation is functional and adaptive (i.e. ‘facilitated’). 

==Computational analyses==
The theory of facilitated variation is supported by computational analyses of the evolution of regulatory networks. These studies confirm that phenotypic variability can be directed towards phenotypes with high fitness even when mutations are randomly distributed, and even when challenged with novel environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Parter2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parter|first1=Merav|last2=Kashtan|first2=Nadav|last3=Alon|first3=Uri|title=Facilitated Variation: How Evolution Learns from Past Environments To Generalize to New Environments|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|date=7 November 2008|volume=4|issue=11|pages=e1000206|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000206|url=http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000206|language=en|issn=1553-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crombach2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crombach|first1=Anton|last2=Hogeweg|first2=Paulien|title=Evolution of Evolvability in Gene Regulatory Networks|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|date=11 July 2008|volume=4|issue=7|pages=e1000112|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000112|url=http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000112|language=en|issn=1553-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Draghi2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Draghi|first1=J.|last2=Wagner|first2=G.

==Facilitated variation and evolution==
In the classical [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] view, a large number of successive [[mutation]]s, each selected for its usefulness to the survival of the organism, is required to produce novel structures such as wings, limbs, or the brain. Alternatively, facilitated variation asserts that the physiological adaptability of core processes and properties such as weak linkage and exploratory processes enable proteins, cells, and body structures to interact in numerous ways that can lead to the creation of novelty with a limited number of genes, and a limited number of mutations.

Therefore, the role of mutations is often to change how, where, and when the genes are expressed during the [[developmental biology|development of the embryo]] and adult. The burden of creativity in evolution does not rest on selection alone. Through its ancient repertoire of core processes, the current phenotype of the animal determines the kind, amount, and viability of phenotypic variation the animal can produce in response to regulatory change. In emphasizing the adaptability of organisms, and their ability to produce functional phenotypes even in the face of mutation or environmental change, Kirschner and Gerhart’s theory builds upon earlier ideas by James Baldwin&lt;ref name="Baldwin1896"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=J. Mark|title=A New Factor in Evolution|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1 June 1896|volume=30|issue=354|pages=441–451|doi=10.1086/276408|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/276408|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Baldwin effect]]), Ivan Schmalhausen,&lt;ref name="Schmalhausen1986"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmalhausen|first1=II|editor1-last=Dobzhansky|editor1-first=T|title=Factors in Evolution: The Theory of Stabilizing Selection|date=1986|publisher=Univ of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conrad Waddington&lt;ref name="Waddington1957"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddington|first1=C.

However, some evolutionary biologists remain skeptical as to whether facilitated variation adds a great deal to evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name=Charlesworth2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Charlesworth | first=Brian | year=2005 | title=On the Origins of Novelty and Variation | journal=Science | volume=310 | issue=5754 | pages=1619–1620 | doi=10.1126/science.1119727 | url=http://toriah.org/articles/charlesworth-2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refutation of Intelligent Design==
[[Creationism|Creationists]] and advocates of [[Intelligent Design]] have argued that [[complex traits]] cannot evolve through successive small modifications to pre-existing functional systems. The theory of facilitated variation challenges this idea of [[irreducible complexity]] by explaining how random mutation can cause substantial and adaptive changes within a species. It explains how the individual organism can change from a passive target of natural selection, to an active player in the 3-billion-year history of evolution. Kirschner and Gerhart's theory thereby provides a scientific rebuttal to modern critics of evolution who champion [[Intelligent Design]].

'''Fortunatus Victor Costa''' (18th/19th centuries) was a minor Maltese philosopher who specialised in [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. I, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Almost nothing is known as yet about the personal life of Costa, only that he hailed from [[Senglea]], [[Malta]], and that in 1806 he was a religious cleric. He might have been studying for the priesthood or else embraced the clerical state on a lifelong basis.

==Extant work==
Only one work of Costa survives: the '''''Metaphysicæ Elementa''''' (Metaphysical Matters), composed in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'',  Vol. II, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; It is still in manuscript form,&lt;ref&gt;[[National Library of Malta]], [[Valletta]], MS. 1073.&lt;/ref&gt; and of course deals with [[metaphysics]]. The work is organised in the typical style of [[Scholasticism]], that is, in parts and chapters as was then used in the schools.

The document is a type of traditional treatise on metaphysics. It is simple in style and unassuming in content.

'''Frugality''' is the quality of being frugal, sparing, thrifty, prudent or economical in the [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of consumable [[resources]] such as [[food]], [[time]] or [[money]], and avoiding waste, lavishness or extravagance.&lt;ref name=cent&gt;{{cite web|title=frugal|url=http://www.leoyan.com/century-dictionary.com/cent2jpgframes.php?volno=03&amp;page=2393|work=Century Dictionary Online|accessdate=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macdonald|first=A.M.

In [[behavioral science]], frugality has been defined as the tendency to acquire goods and services in a restrained manner, and resourceful use of already owned economic goods and services, to achieve a longer term [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lastovicka|first=J.

==Strategies==
Common [[strategies]] of frugality include the reduction of [[waste]], curbing costly [[habituation|habit]]s, suppressing instant [[gratification]] by means of fiscal self-restraint, seeking [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]], avoiding traps, defying expensive [[social norms]], detecting and avoiding [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] advertising, embracing cost-free options, using [[barter]], and staying well-informed about local circumstances and both market and product/service realities.

In the context of some belief systems, frugality is a ''[[philosophy]]'' in which one does not trust (or is deeply wary of) "expert" knowledge from commercial markets or corporate cultures, claiming to know what is in the best economic, material, or spiritual interests of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Child, Hamilton: "How to Succeed in Business," Gazetteer and Business Directory of Ontario County, N.Y., for 1867-8, Page 91 e.g. H. Child, 1867&lt;/ref&gt;

Different spiritual communities consider frugality to be a virtue or a spiritual discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Richard Cartwright: "Environmental Theology", Page 169. Creekside Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Religious Society of Friends]] and the [[Puritan]]s are examples of such groups.&lt;ref&gt;Mecklin, John M.: "An Introduction to Social Ethics, The Social Conscience in a Democracy", Page 254. Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; The basic philosophy behind this is the idea that people ought to save money in order to allocate it to more charitable purposes, such as helping others in need.&lt;ref&gt;Watkinson, William L.: "Frugality in the Spiritual Life", Page 7. F. H. Revell company, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also [[environmentalists]] who consider frugality to be a virtue&lt;ref&gt;[[George Fillmore Swain|Swain, George Fillmore]]; ''Conservation of Water by Storage'', [[Yale University Press]], 1915, p. 26 e.g.&lt;/ref&gt; through which humans can make use of their ancestral skills as hunter-gatherers, carrying little and needing little, and finding meaning in nature instead of man-made conventions or religion. [[Henry David Thoreau]] expressed a similar philosophy in ''[[Walden]]'', with his zest for self-reliance and minimal possessions while [[simple living|living simply]] in the woods.&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David: "Walden", Page 184 e.g. T. Y. Crowell &amp; co, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate world==
Frugality has been adopted as a strategic imperative by large enterprises as a means of cost reduction&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Phil: "http://freecheap.blogspot.com/" 2010&lt;/ref&gt; through engenderment of a philosophy of careful spending amongst the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Woerner, Stephanie L.; "Networked at Cisco", Page 13. Center for eBusiness, Sloan School of Management, MIT, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Cost reduction is often perceived negatively, be it within a corporate organisation or in society, so inviting each employee to embrace frugality transfers the burden of cost reduction from management to the employee. In doing so, corporations introduce a moral obligation to cost cutting, proposing the notion that careful management of costs is in the company, shareholder and employee's best interests.

'''Gaetano Mosca''' (1 April 1858 – 8 November 1941) was an Italian [[Political Science|political scientist]], [[Journalism|journalist]] and [[Bureaucrat|public servant]]. He is credited with developing the [[elite theory]] and the doctrine of the [[political class]] and is one of the three members constituting the [[Italian school of elitism]] together with [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Robert Michels]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Nye, ''The Anti-Democratic Sources of Elite Theory: Pareto, Mosca, Michels'', Sage, 1977, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Chambliss (ed.), ''Philosophy of Education: An Encyclopedia'', Routledge, 2013, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Mosca earned a degree in law from the [[University of Palermo]] in 1881.  In 1887 he moved to [[Rome]] and took a position as editor of proceedings of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy]].  Having taught occasionally at [[Palermo]] and [[Rome]], Mosca became chair of constitutional law at the [[University of Turin]] in 1896.  He would hold this position until 1924, when he settled permanently in [[Rome]] to occupy the chair of public law at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]].  Mosca held several other academic positions throughout his life.

In 1909 Mosca was elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy]], in which he served until 1919.  During this time, he served as Under-secretary for the Colonies from 1914 until 1916.  In 1919, Mosca was nominated [[senator for life|life senator]] of the [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]].  He served actively in this capacity until 1926.  During the [[Fascist]] dictatorship, Mosca retired to teach and research. In 1925 he signed the [[Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals]].

During this time, Mosca also worked as a political journalist for the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' of [[Milan]] (after 1901) and the ''[[Tribuna]]'' of [[Rome]] (from 1911 to 1921).&lt;ref&gt;A.. Colombo, [http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/agosto/08/eredita_Gaetano_Mosca_co_8_100808050.shtml "L'eredità di Gaetano Mosca"], ''Corriere della Sera'', August 8, 2010, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosca is most famous, however, for his works of political theory.  These were ''{{lang|it|Sulla teorica dei governi e sul governo parlamentare}}'' (Theory of Governments and Parliamentary Government), published in 1884; ''{{lang|it|Elementi di scienza politica}}'' (The Ruling Class), published in 1896; and ''{{lang|it|Storia delle dottrine politiche}}'' (History of Political Doctrines), published in 1936.

== Political thought ==
Mosca's enduring contribution to [[political science]] is the observation that all but the most primitive societies are ruled in fact, if not in theory, by a numerical minority.  He named this minority the [[political class]]. That means that every society could be split between two social classes: the one who rules and the one which is ruled. This is always true, for Mosca, because without a political class there is no rule.

Although his theory is correctly characterized as ''elitist'', it should be observed that its basis is far different from ''[[The Power Elite]]'' described by, for example, [[C. Wright Mills]]. Unlike Mills and later sociologists, Mosca aimed to develop a universal theory of [[political society]] and his more general theory of the ''Political Class'' reflects this aim.
&lt;ref&gt;C.. Martinelli, [http://www.storiacostituzionale.it/doc_17/martinelli.pdf "L'organizzazione del potere nel pensiero di Gaetano Mosca"], ''Giornale di Storia Costituzionale'', 17, first semester, 2009, pp. 177-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosca defined modern elites in term of their superior organizational skills.  These organizational skills were especially useful in gaining political power in modern [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] society. Nevertheless, Mosca's theory was more liberal than the elitist theory of, for example, [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]], since in Mosca's conception, elites are not hereditary in nature and peoples from all classes of society can theoretically become elite: when this happens, the reproduction of power is defined as democratic; whereas, when the member's recycle remains inside the elite, the reproduction of power is defined as aristocratic. He also adhered to the concept of the circulation of elites, which is a dialectical theory of constant competition between elites, with one elite group replacing another repeatedly over time. That concept came from his materialist idea of history as a conflict between classes ([[Karl Marx|Marx]]), from the conflicted nature of politic considered as a fight for acquisition and department of power ([[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]) and finally from the non-egalitarian and hierarchical structure of society. Unlike Marx, Mosca has not a linear concept of time, but a circular one, as in classical political theory, which consists in a perpetual condition of conflict and recycle of the elite. For Mosca, the dichotomous structure of society wouldn't be solved by the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manuale di storia del pensiero politico|last = Galli|first = Carlo|publisher = Il Mulino|year = 2011|isbn = 978-88-15-23233-5|location = Bologna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20572">The '''Greenhouse Effect''' is a theory of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices' behavior, first proposed by [[Hoover Institution]] economist [[Thomas Sowell]] and popularized by [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Court of Appeals]] Senior Judge [[Laurence Silberman]] in a speech to [[The Federalist Society]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Martin Tolchin, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/15/us/press-is-condemned-by-a-federal-judge-for-court-coverage.html Press Is Condemned By a Federal Judge For Court Coverage] ''The New York Times'', 6/15/1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tushnet, Mark. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Pr0YbpKnwgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+court+divided&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=87KMT6LZO8SjiQK0gf2ICA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "A Court Divided"]. Norton, 2005, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the word "Greenhouse" refers to [[Linda Greenhouse]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning reporter who covered the Supreme Court for the ''[[New York Times]]'' for 40 years. Silberman used the term to postulate a tendency of conservative [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justices to vote with the liberals more often as their careers progress due to a desire for favorable press coverage. He said "It seems that the primary objective of The Times's legal reporters is to put activist heat on recently appointed Supreme Court justices."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

The existence of the Greenhouse Effect has been challenged by some commentators, who note it presumes a "vast, hegemonic liberal control over the media and academia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lithwick|first=Dahlia|title=The Souter Factor |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2005/08/the_souter_factor.html|publisher=Slate|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and question whether professional decision makers who have "come to their views despite years of elite education and exposure to elite opinion" are really so malleable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanson|first=Jon|title=The Drifters: Why The Supreme Court Makes Justices More Liberal|url=http://bostonreview.net/BR31.1/hansonbenforado.php|publisher=Boston Review|accessdate=17 April 2012|author2=Adam Benforado}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the evidence below suggests that conservative justices become liberal more often than liberals become conservative. Further, the existence of a more general version of the Greenhouse Effect, one not restricted to the media but rather "elites" in general or legal elites, is less controversial. Though this does not show causation, 75% of law professors who began their careers after 1986 identify as liberal, while only 10% identify as conservative.&lt;ref name="Judges and Their Audiences"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baum |first=Lawrence|title=Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691138275|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests more "elite" journalists identify as liberal than conservative.&lt;ref name="Judges and Their Audiences"/&gt;

==Origins of the theory==

The Greenhouse Effect refers to [[Linda Greenhouse]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning ''[[New York Times]]'' Supreme Court reporter for over three decades, currently a Senior Fellow at [[Yale Law School]]. Greenhouse came under fire from conservatives for publicly espousing liberal viewpoints by participating in a 1989 pro-choice march and in remarks at the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study|Radcliffe Institute]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shafer|first=jack|title=The Gas Over Linda Greenhouse |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2007/08/the_gas_over_linda_greenhouse.html|publisher=Slate|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aronoff|first=Roger|title=The Greenhouse Effect|url=http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/the-greenhouse-effect/|publisher=Accuracy In Media|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calame|first=Byron|title=Hazarding Personal Opinions in Public Can Be Hazardous for Journalists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/opinion/08pubed.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenhouse herself commented on the origins of the theory in an interview with NPR:

{{quote|Ms. Wertheimer: In a 1992 speech to the Federalist Society, Lawrence Silberman, who is an appeals court judge, referred to the greenhouse effect. By which he partly meant you, and he partly meant activist heat, he said, that the Times legal reporters put on recently appointed justices to try to influence their opinions. It certainly did kind of single you out as being an influential player in the world of the court.

Ms. Greenhouse: Well, Judge Silberman is giving credit for coming up with that snarky phrase, but actually, he swiped it off from Tom Bethell, the economist, who had put it in a column shortly before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wertheimer|first=Linda|title=Supreme Court Reporter Linda Greenhouse Retires|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92489115|publisher=NPR|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is unclear whether Ms. Greenhouse meant to refer to Mr. Bethell or Mr. Sowell. Mr. Bethell, an editor at the ''[[American Spectator]]'' and another [[Hoover Institution]] fellow, started the "Strange New Respect Awards", which are given to conservatives who have become more liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pleszczynski|first=Wlady|title=Strange New Respect|url=http://spectator.org/blog/2007/03/05/strange-new-respect|publisher=American Spectator|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ms. Greenhouse is said by some to have inspired the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Scott|title=An Exceedingly Strange New Respect|url=http://www.looktruenorth.com/limited-government/49-conservatism/5837-an-exceedingly-strange-new-respect.html|publisher=Look True North}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Sowell is more often cited as the origin of the name of the theory.

==Example commentary incorporating the theory==

[[Pat Buchanan]], a conservative political commentator, wrote the passage below, after quoting Linda Greenhouse in reference to Justice [[John Paul Stevens]]' advocating for a reconsideration of the death penalty in ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'':

{{quote|For his defection to the abolitionist camp, the 88-year-old justice was rewarded with her patented deep massage by Linda Greenhouse, the veteran — and after 30 years retiring — Supreme Court reporter of The New York Times: "When Justice John Paul Stevens intervened in a Supreme Court argument on Wednesday to score a few points off the lawyer who was defending the death penalty for the rape of a child, the courtroom audience saw a master strategist at work, fully in command of the flow of the argument and the smallest details of the case. For those accustomed to watching Justice Stevens, it was a familiar sight." ... But had Stevens moved from left to right, rather than the reverse, one imagines Greenhouse's enthusiasm for the "master strategist" would have been well contained. What we see here is a textbook example of what U.S. Judge Laurence Silberman calls "The Greenhouse Effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Patrick |title=The Greenhouse Effect|url=http://buchanan.org/blog/pjb-the-greenhouse-effect-982|publisher=Patrick Buchanan|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==The Supreme Court and the media==

Supreme Court author, Larry Berkson, holds that the Supreme Court has two audiences: the highly attentive legal profession and the less engaged general public.&lt;ref name=Berkson&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkson|first=Larry|title=The Supreme Court and Its Publics|year=1978 |publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lexington, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;   If the Supreme Court is without the general public's backing, its authority may be eroded. However, the Court must remain independent of the ongoing political process. Richard Davis discusses this relationship with the Court and the public as, "the paradox of imagemaking – to engage in imagemaking while denying its existence to maintain the image."&lt;ref name=Davis9&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Richard|title=Decisions and Images: The Supreme Court and the Press |year=1994 |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-034505-9|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the majority of the general public does not have the time, interest or expertise to read the opinions for themselves, they must depend on newspapers, periodicals, radio and TV for its information.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite news|last=Warren|first=Earl |title=Statement on Special committee of Supreme Court Decisions|date=September 12, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Justices have also been known to survey reporters to determine if they were interpreting their opinions as intended.  In these ways and more the Court also tried to shape the way the media covers the justices and their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|title=The Problem of Journalism: a political economic contribution to an explanation of the crisis in contemporary US journalism|year=2003 |volume=4 |issue=3|pages=229–329 |url=http://www.studiogaijin.org/iserlohn/wien/klasse/fernsehen/p299_s.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court also receives news of the public's reactions to its decisions through the press. Some scholars have postulated that swing justices, who have disproportionate influence over the court, may be more attuned to public opinion since their own policy preferences are weaker than their colleagues.&lt;ref name=Davis17-18&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Richard|title=Decisions and Images: The Supreme Court and the Press|year=1994 |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc. |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-034505-9|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States|demographics of the Supreme Court]] reveal that Justices tend to be more highly educated and wealthy relative to the rest of the nation. In 2007, 7 of the 9 justices had a net worth of over a million dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Becker|first=Bernie|title=Justices List Their Assets; Wide Range of Wealth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/07/washington/07scotus.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and all of the justices attended an [[Ivy League]] law school.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Social psychology|Social psychological theory]] holds that we seek approval from those similar to us, and those we interact with more often. In the court's case, this means Justices may be more influenced by elites than by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baum|first=Lawrence|author2=Neal Devins|title=Why the Supreme Court Cares About Elites, Not the American People|journal=Georgetown Law Journal|year=2010|volume=98|pages=1515–1581|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1116|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the cause, it is well established that many Supreme Court Justices exhibit sizable shifts in voting patterns over their careers, much more so than would be expected for experienced jurists who are chosen for life service on the nation's highest court.&lt;ref name="Epstein 2007 1483–1542"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Lee |author2=Andrew D. Martin |author3=Kevin M. Quinn |author4=Jeffrey A. Segal|title=Ideological Drift Among Supreme Court Justices: Who, When and How Important?|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=2007|volume=101|issue=4|pages=1483–1542|url=http://epstein.usc.edu/research/ideodrift.pdf|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence Baum found some evidence that supports the effect's existence. However, the research is not definitive at this point in time, as it is hampered by the small sample size of Supreme Court justices in the modern era. Furthermore, it is important to note that much of Baum's research focuses on the influence of "elite" opinion, not just the media. However, the evidence for the influence of "elite" opinion is more robust than the evidence for media specifically.

''[[Amicus curiae]]'' briefs and law review articles can influence the court by providing precedents or reasoning to support a position. In ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'' the court overturned the precedent relating to school prayer that it had established in ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'' just three years earlier, ruling that students did not have to salute the flag, which was applauded by liberals. Notably, 31 out of the 39 law review articles commenting on Gobitis condemned the decision. Justice [[Hugo Black]] was said by Justice [[William O. Douglas]] to have changed his mind because "he had been reading the papers".&lt;ref name="Judges and Their Audiences c"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baum|first=Lawrence|title=Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691138275|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', an affirmative action case, 83 out of the 102 ''amicus'' briefs supported affirmative action, and briefs filed by "elites" such as Fortune 500 companies, colleges, and states displayed even higher levels for support for affirmative action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baum|first=Lawrence|author2=Neal Devins|title=Why the Supreme Court Cares About Elites, Not the American People |journal=Georgetown Law Journal|year=2010|volume=98|pages=1567|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1116|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Gannett Co. v. Depasquale]]'' the court held that the 6th Amendment didn't guarantee public access to trials. The media erupted in a firestorm of criticism, prompting four Justices to make public statements about the meaning of the case. However, one year later, the court reversed itself in ''[[Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia]]''.&lt;ref name="Judges and Their Audiences b"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baum|first=Lawrence|title=Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691138275|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the modern era and in a variety of cases, Supreme Court decisions better reflect the opinions of the highly educated than general public opinion. For example, in 1964, 41.4% of those with post-graduate degrees agreed with the court's position on school prayer compared to only 14.9% of those with lower levels of education.&lt;ref name="Baum 2010 1571"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baum|first=Lawrence |author2=Neal Devins|title=Why the Supreme Court Cares About Elites, Not the American People|journal=Georgetown Law Journal|year=2010 |volume=98|pages=1571|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1116|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an equivalent gulf for ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'', the 1990 decision concerning flag burning.&lt;ref name="Baum 2010 1571"/&gt; In 2003, in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which legalized homosexual intercourse in states that had anti-sodomy laws, 75% of people with post-graduate degrees agreed with the court, whereas 51% of those with lower levels of education agreed.&lt;ref name="Baum 2010 1571"/&gt;

Some of the strongest empirical evidence concerns the difference between conservative Justices who lived in [[Washington, D.C.]] before they were nominated and those who did not. The evidence from the modern era is summarized in the table below. The table displays the change in pro-civil liberties votes from Justice's early terms and later terms. A higher percentage of pro-civil liberties votes is generally regarded as more liberal.

==Notable affected justices==

Only four of the twenty-six Justices serving since 1937 remained relatively stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Lee |author2=Andrew D. Martin |author3=Kevin M. Quinn |author4=Jeffrey A. Segal|title=IDEOLOGICAL DRIFT AMONG SUPREME COURT JUSTICES: WHO, WHEN, AND HOW IMPORTANT?|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=2007|volume=101|issue=4|url=http://epstein.usc.edu/research/ideodrift.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] was famously said to have "evolved" over his career, becoming much more liberal in later decades; Linda Greenhouse herself wrote an article about Blackmun called "The Evolution of A Justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|title=The Evolution of a Justice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/10/magazine/10BLACKMUN.html|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably, he wrote the opinion in favor of legalizing abortion in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. This is despite the fact that President [[Richard Nixon]] asked Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] if "he could resist the Washington cocktail party circuit" before his nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baum|first=Lawrence|title=Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691138275|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other Republican presidents' nominees shifted to the left, such as Brennan, O'Connor, Souter and Stevens.&lt;ref name="Epstein 2007 1483–1542"/&gt;  Some justices have shifted to the right, such as [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Byron White]], but on the whole in the modern era there have been more shifts to the left than the right. Frankfurter began his career in the 1938 term as a slightly left-of-center Justice, closer to the term's likely median. Virtually from the start of his second term, however, Frankfurter appears to have drifted right. By the conclusion of his tenure, Frankfurter was second only to John M. Harlan II as the Court's most extreme conservative voter; he actually ended his service more firmly planted on the right than Chief Justice Rehnquist.&lt;ref name="Epstein 2007 1483–1542"/&gt;  Justice Black's movement to the right was not missed by some commentators. As James F. Simon once wrote, Black's "increasingly brittle, unmistakably conservative tilt" actually proved embarrassing to many of his admirers.&lt;ref name="Epstein 2007 1483–1542"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=James|title=Judging the Justices|year=1994|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|jstor=1229375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of sitting justices as of 2012, Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] is noted for having become much more liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trapp|first=Mark|title=Kennedy's Benchmarks|url=http://spectator.org/archives/2004/07/14/kennedys-benchmarks|publisher=American Spectator|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy had been expected to be the swing vote overturning ''Roe v. Wade'' in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', but instead voted to uphold it, with the evidence suggesting he changed his mind between conference and the final vote.&lt;ref name="Eastland 1993 32"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eastland|first=Terry|title=The Tempting of Justice Kennedy|journal=The American Spectator|date=February 1993|volume=26|issue=2|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy had previously changed his mind in ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'', concerning school prayer. Kennedy has been observed to be concerned with how he will go down in history. In an interview given just minutes before Casey was handed down, he said "Sometimes you don't know if you're Caesar about to cross the Rubicon or Captain Queeg cutting your own tow line." Kennedy displays the concern with his historical image that would lend credence to the Greenhouse Effect, for example by having his clerks clip all news stories about him.&lt;ref name="Eastland 1993 32"/&gt;

The '''Holy Confucian Church''' or '''Holy Church of Confucius''' (孔圣会 ''Kǒngshènghuì'') or '''Holy Confucian Church of China''' (中华孔圣会 ''Zhōnghuá Kǒngshènghuì'') is a body formed of many local [[Confucian churches]] or halls (孔圣堂 ''Kǒngshèngtáng'') in [[China]]. The [[grassroots]] movement was initiated by Zhou Beichen, a disciple of the Confucian philosopher [[Jiang Qing (Confucian)|Jiang Qing]], who founded the first holy church in [[Shenzhen]] in 2009.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=152-154}} The aim of the movement was to develop a network of local Confucian churches throughout the country,{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=156}} eventually unifying into a national body and becoming the [[state religion]] of China.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=156}} The Holy Confucian Church has received support from the [[Confucian Academy]] of [[Hong Kong]], although it has developed independently from the latter.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=152}}

In 2010 the first holy church in Shenzhen was officially registered as a non-governmental non-profit (''fēi qǐyè'' 非企业) organisation of public interest (''gōngyì'' 公益) affiliated with the Federation of Confucian Culture of [[Qufu]] City.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=154}} The Holy Church maintains close relations with local government officials and high-ranking dignitaries of the [[State Administration for Religious Affairs]] attend its ceremonies.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=155}} The national and international body, the Holy Confucian Church of China, was finally established in late 2015.&lt;ref name="Hou"&gt;{{cite article|last=Hou|first=Xiaobing|title=当代儒家成立“孔圣会”意欲何为？|trans-title=Contemporary Ruists set up "Holy Church of Confucius", what will this mean?|publisher=China Confucian Philosophy Network|date=13 November 2015|url=http://www.rujiazg.com/article/id/6921/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117155316/http://www.rujiazg.com/article/id/6921/|archive-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=深圳成立「中華孔聖會」 面向全球弘揚儒道|trans-title=Holy Confucian Church of China set up in Shenzhen for the worldwide promotion of the Ruist way|website=gd.wenweipo.com|date=26 November 2015|url=http://gd.wenweipo.com/?action-viewnews-itemid-13082|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406235633/http://gd.wenweipo.com/?action-viewnews-itemid-13082|archive-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang Bo"&gt;{{cite article|last=Zhang|first=Bo|title=中华孔圣会”成立 儒家拟走向宗教化|trans-title=Holy Confucian Church established to be the hub of Confucian religion|website=news.sohu.com|date=20 November 2015|url=http://news.sohu.com/20151120/n427407420.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213190347/http://news.sohu.com/20151120/n427407420.shtml|archive-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the founder and the organisation==
Zhou Beichen was born in the province of [[Guizhou]] in 1965.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=153}} He studies at the [[Guizhou University]] and experienced with work in journalism, publishing and teaching.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=153}} In the 1980s he was interested in [[Western philosophy]], while in the 1990s he studied the works of many contemporary [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] circles.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=153}}

Later, Zhou Beichen approached to [[Jiang Qing (Confucian)|Jiang Qing]]'s work on the [[Gongyang Zhuan|Gongyang]] (公羊) school of [[New Text Confucianism]], especially the idea of political Confucianism or the "outside kingship" (外王).{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=153}} In 1996 he met Jiang Qing in person and they founded together the Yangming Academy in Guizhou.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=153}} Between that year and 2003 he settled down in [[Shenzhen]], living with business activity and projecting the Confucian holy halls (''Kongshengtang'') movement which officially started in 2009.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=153}}

The Confucian holy halls multiplied over the following years and on 1 November 2015 many Confucian scholars including Jiang Qing, Kang Xiaoguang, Zhang Xianglong and Sheng Hong gathered in Shenzhen for the formal establishment of a national and international Holy Confucian Church which would encompass all local Confucian congregations and civil organisations.&lt;ref name="Hou"/&gt; Jiang Qing was appointed as the spiritual leader of the church.&lt;ref name="Hou"/&gt;

Some see the Holy Confucian Church as a continuation of the Confucian Church that was founded in 1912 by [[Kang Youwei]], a Confucian reformer, but which was later disbanded because of hostile political climate.&lt;ref name="Hou"/&gt; The contemporary Holy Confucian Church aims to foster folk Confucian and traditional religion in a period of deep crisis of the Chinese civilisation, and represent a "body" for the "soul" of the Chinese, or a new embodiment of the "wandering soul" of Confucianism deprived of its social structure after the empire fell apart.&lt;ref name="Zhang Bo"/&gt; The church has found some opposition, even within the Confucian community, by people who see it as an imitation of [[Christianity]] and fear a departure from the teachings of Confucianism.&lt;ref name="Hou"/&gt;

Besides the nourishment of Chinese culture, the Holy Church's constitution also mentions the aim of maintaining the "religious ecology" (宗教生态 ''zōngjiào shēngtài'') of Chinese society through the absorption and reinterpretation of alien religions and heterodox cults into Confucianism.&lt;ref name="Hou"/&gt;

==Structure of the church==
The Holy Confucian Church is a highly structured institution both in its doctrine of the faith and in its organisation.&lt;ref name="Zhang Bo"/&gt; The reference to its "holiness" in its name means that the church reflects the sacred order of nature in holidays, ancestral ties and the environment.&lt;ref name="Zhang Bo"/&gt;

Its local congregations (孔圣堂 ''Kǒngshèngtáng'') are at the same times schools and temples (学庙和一 ''xué miào hé yī'') for the education of the individuals and the moral reconstitution of society, the filial way (孝慈之道 ''xiàocí zhī dào'') and spiritual home (精神家园 ''jīngshén jiāyuán'') of Chinese life.{{sfnb|Payette|2014}} Its worship halls are called ''dàochǎng'' (道场 "place of the way"), a term for wide worship halls.

==Economy of the church==
In order to develop independently from the support of sponsors as it was the case in the first months after its creation, in 2010 the Holy Confucian Church of Shenzhen adopted a "sustainable development model", also termed the "Shenzhen model" by the media.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=155}} The policy implies the self-support of the Church through wedding and funeral rites, and through schools of "Confucian corporate culture" for business companies.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=155}} The goal of the church is to provide non-profit services, and it offers education, rituals and other activities which are free of charge.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=155}}

The nationwide Holy Confucian Church created in 2015 plans to replicate the Shenzhen model all over China and abroad and form missionary institutes and community-oriented lecture circuits, and Confucian schools.&lt;ref name="Zhang Bo"/&gt; These objectives will be financed by integrated social donations and funding members, contributions from local government for public services at [[Temples of Confucius]], its industrial platform, and other resources.&lt;ref name="Zhang Bo"/&gt;

'''Hospitality''' refers to the relationship between a guest and a host, wherein the host receives the guest with goodwill, including the reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers. Louis, chevalier de Jaucourt describes hospitality in the Encyclopédie as the virtue of a great soul that cares for the whole universe through the ties of humanity.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"&gt;Jaucourt, Louis, chevalier de. "Hospitality." The Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project. Translated by Sophie Bourgault. Ann Arbor: Michigan Publishing, University of Michigan Library, 2013.

Trans. of "Hospitalité," Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, vol. 8. Paris, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hospitality ethics''' is a discipline that studies this usage of hospitality.

==Etymology ==
Derives from the Latin ''hospes'',&lt;ref&gt;C. Lewis, Elementary Latin Dictionary (Oxford Univ. Press, 2000), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "host", "guest", or "stranger". ''Hospes'' is formed from ''hostis'', which means "stranger" or "enemy" (the latter being where terms like "hostile" derive). By [[metonymy]] the Latin word 'Hospital' means a guest-chamber, guest's lodging, an inn.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, revised by Marchant, J &amp; Charles J., 260th. Thousand&lt;/ref&gt; Hospes/hostis is thus the root for the English words [[Wikt:host|host]], hospitality, hospice, hostel and hotel.

==Historical practice==
In ancient cultures hospitality involved welcoming the stranger and offering him food, shelter, and safety.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3uCAshDkca8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hospitality&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9tN7fnevRAhUIfiYKHdKIBqgQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Hospitality&amp;f=false Pohl, Christine D., ''Making Room: Recovering Hospitality as a Christian Tradition'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999] {{ISBN|9780802844316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global concepts==

===Ancient Greece===
In [[Ancient Greece]], hospitality was a right, with the host being expected to make sure the needs of his guests were met. The ancient Greek term ''[[Xenia (Greek)|xenia]]'', or ''theoxenia'' when a god was involved, expressed this ritualized guest-friendship relation. In Greek society a person's ability to abide by the laws of hospitality determined nobility and social standing. The Stoics regarded hospitality as a duty inspired by Zeus himself.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt;

===India and Nepal===
In [[India]] and [[Nepal]] hospitality is based on the principle ''[[Atithi Devo Bhav]]a'', meaning "the guest is God". This principle is shown in a number of stories where a guest is revealed to be a god who rewards the provider of hospitality. From this stems the Indian or Nepal practice of graciousness towards guests at home and in all social situations. The ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]],'' an ancient [[Indian literature|Indian work]] on [[ethics]] and [[morality]], explains the ethics of hospitality through its verses 81 through 90, dedicating a separate chapter on it (Chapter 9).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=2014-12-16 }} verses 71-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf | title=Thirukkural English Translation and Commentary | publisher=W.H. Allen, &amp; Co | first = GU |last = Pope &lt;!--| authorlink=Thirukkural English Translation--&gt; | year=1886 | pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 002.jpg|thumb|Mosaic at [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale, Ravenna]], Abraham and the angels, pre-547]]
Judaism praises hospitality to strangers and guests based largely on the examples of [[Abraham]] and [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|18:1–8|HE}} and {{Bibleverse-nb||Genesis|19:1–8|HE}}). In Hebrew, the practice is called ''hachnasat orchim'', or "welcoming guests". Besides other expectations, hosts are expected to provide nourishment, comfort, and entertainment for their guests,&lt;ref name="Kagan 1888 284"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kagan|first=Yisrael Meir|title=Ahavath chesed : the Love of Kindness|date=1888|publisher=Feldheim|location=Warsaw|isbn=0873061675|page=284|edition=2nd, rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of the visit, hosts customarily escort their guests out of their home, wishing them a safe journey.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud Sotah, 46B&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
In [[Christianity]], hospitality is a [[Theological virtues|virtue]] which is a reminder of sympathy for strangers and a rule to welcome visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Montandon, ''L'hospitalité au XVIIIe siècle'', Presses Universitaires Blaise Pascal, France, 2000, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This is a virtue found in the Old Testament, with, for example, the custom of the [[foot washing]] of visitors or the [[kiss of peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. Elwell, ''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'', Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Cunningham, Keith J. Egan, ''Christian Spirituality: Themes from the Tradition'', Paulist Press, USA, 1996, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; It was taught by [[Jesus]] in the New Testament. Indeed, Jesus said that those who had welcomed a stranger had welcomed him.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Baker, ''Hospitality and World Politics'', Springer, UK, 2013, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western countries have developed a host culture for immigrants, based on the [[bible]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Olaf Kleist, Irial Glynn, ''History, Memory and Migration: Perceptions of the Past and the Politics of Incorporation'', Palgrave Macmillan, USA, 2012, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pashtun===
One of the main principles of [[Pashtunwali]] is [[Melmastia]]. This is the display of hospitality and profound respect to all visitors (regardless of race, religion, national affiliation or economic status) without any hope of remuneration or favour. [[Pashtuns]] will go to great lengths to show their hospitality.&lt;ref name="Banting"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afghanistan the People |last1=Banting |first1=Erinn |authorlink=|volume=|year=2003|publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |location=|isbn=0-7787-9335-4|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fl8cd15sc7wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Erinn%20Banting%22&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
Islam highly recommends one another to say peace be upon you [[salam Wa Alaikum]] to one another as Muhammad had said,
Muslims are obliged to treat their guest with kindness and peace even prisoners (in war), As Muhammad had said in authentic sources and verses from the Quran

[[Abu Aziz ibn Umair]] reported: I was among the prisoners of war on the day of the [[battle of Badr]]. Muhammad had said, “I enjoin you to treat the captives well.” After I accepted Islam, I was among the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] (Inhabitants of [[Madinah]]) and when the time of lunch or dinner arrived, I would feed dates to the prisoners for I had been fed bread due to the command of Muhammad. [[al-Mu’jam al-Kabīr 18444]]

Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: [[16:125]] Quran

Good hospitality is crucial in Islam even in business According to another report, Muhammad passed by a pile of food in the market. He put his hand inside it and felt dampness, although the surface was dry. He said:
“O owner of the food, what is this?’
The man said, ‘It was damaged by rain, O Messenger of God.’
He said, ‘Why did you not put the rain-damaged food on top so that people could see it!  Whoever cheats us is not one of us.” ([[Saheeh Muslim]])

===Celtic cultures===
Celtic societies also valued the concept of hospitality, especially in terms of protection. A host who granted a person's request for refuge was expected not only to provide food and shelter for his/her guest, but to make sure they did not come to harm while under their care.&lt;ref&gt;Charles MacKinnon, ''Scottish Highlanders'' (1984, [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] Books); page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage==
In the West today hospitality is rarely a matter of protection and survival and is more associated with [[etiquette]] and [[entertainment]]. However, it still involves showing respect for one's guests, providing for their needs, and treating them as equals. Cultures and subcultures vary in the extent to which one is expected to show hospitality to strangers, as opposed to personal friends or members of one's [[ingroup]].

===Anthropology of hospitality===
[[Jacques Derrida]] offers a model to understand hospitality that divides unconditional hospitality from conditional hospitality. Over the centuries, philosophers have devoted considerable attention to the problem of hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, J. (2000). “Hospitality”.  Angelaki: Journal of Theoretical Humanities,5(3), 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, hospitality offers a paradoxical situation (like language) since inclusion of those who are welcomed in the sacred law of hospitality implies others will be rejected. Julia Kristeva (1991) alerts readers to the dangers of “perverse hospitality”, which consists of taking advantage of the vulnerability of aliens to dispossess them.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, J. (1991). Extranjeros para nosotros mismos, trad. de X. Gispert, Barcelona, Plaza &amp; Janes Editores (Hombre y Sociedad).&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitality serves to reduce the tension in the process of host-guest encounters, producing a liminal zone that combines curiosity about others and fear of strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Graburn, N. H. (1983). “The anthropology of tourism”. Annals of tourism research, 10(1), 9-33.&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, the meaning of hospitality centres on the belief that strangers should be assisted and protected while traveling.&lt;ref&gt;Lashley, C. (1995). Towards an understanding of employee empowerment in hospitality services. International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 7(1), 27-32.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all voices are in agreement with this concept. Professor [[Anthony Pagden]] describes how the concept of hospitality was historically manipulated to legitimate the conquest of Americas by imposing the right of free transit, which was conducive to the formation of the modern nation-state. This suggests that hospitality is a political institution which can be ideologically deformed to oppress others.&lt;ref&gt;Pagden, A. (1995). Lords of all the worlds: ideologies of empire in Spain, Britain and France c. 1500-c. 1850. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3185">'''Hoter ben Shlomo''' ('''''Hoteb/Hatab ben Shlomo''''', '''''Manṣūr ibn Sulaymān al-Dhamārī''''', '''''Manṣūr ibn Sulaymān al-Ghamari''''', c.1400&amp;ndash;c.1480) was a scholar and philosopher from [[Yemen]] who was heavily influenced by the earlier works of [[Natan'el al-Fayyumi]], [[Maimonides]], [[Saadia Gaon]] and [[al-Ghazali]].

The connection between the ''Epistle of the [[Brethren of Purity]]'' and [[Isma'ilism]] might have suggested the adoption of this work as one of the main sources of what would become known as “Jewish Ismailism” as was found in late medieval Yemenite Judaism.  This “Jewish Ismailism” consisted of adapting Ismaili doctrines about cosmology, prophecy and hermeneutics.  There are many examples of the Brethren of Purity influencing [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite Jewish]] philosophers and authors in the period 1150-1550.&lt;ref&gt;D. Blumenthal, "An  Illustration of the Concept 'Philosophic Mysticism' from Fifteenth Century Yemen," and "A Philosophical-Mystical Interpretation of a Shi'ur Qomah Text."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, David R. The Commentary of R. Hoter Ben Shelomo to the Thirteen Principles of Maimonides, Etudes sur le judaisme médiéval, vol. 6 (Leiden: Brill, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, David R. Philosophic Mysticism: Essays in Rational Religion (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, David R.The Philosophic Questions and Answers of Hoter Ben Shelomo, Etudes sur le judaisme médiéval, vol. 11 (Leiden: Brill, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, chapter two of the Judaeo-Arabic theologic-philosophical work by Natan'el al-Fayyumi, ''The Garden of Intellects'' (''Bustan al-‘uqul''), written in Yemen in 1165, includes a correspondence between the numbers 1 through 10 and ten scientific and philosophical concepts (soul's faculties, senses, directions, bodily substances and parts, etc.) most of which are identical to those listed by the Brethren of Purity.

Some traces of Brethren of Purity doctrines, as well as of their [[numerology]] or [[Hurufism]], are found in two Yemenite philosophical [[midrash]]im written in 1420-1430: "''The Glad Learning''" (Midrash ha-hefez) by ''Zerahyah ha-Rofé'' (''Yahya al-Tabib'') and the "''Lamp of Intellects''" (''Siraj al-‘uqul'') by Hoter ben Solomon.  Ḥoter’s ideas are expounded in his ''al-Qawāʿid'' "Commentary" [on [[Maimonides]]’ ''Thirteen Principles'']", the ''Sabʿīn Masʾala'' "Seventy Questions" and ''Miʾa Masʾala'' "One Hundred Questions", listed together as ''Sheʾelot u-Teshuvot Hoter ben Shelomo'', the ''Sirāj al-ʿUqūl'' "Lamp of the Intellects", a midrash to the Torah, and ''Sharh ʿalā Perush ha-Mishna'' [''shel ha-Rambam''] "Explication of [Maimonides’] Commentary to the Mishna".&lt;ref&gt;David Blumenthal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6024">"'''Justice as Fairness: Political not Metaphysical'''" is an essay by [[John Rawls]], published in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, "Justice as Fairness: Political not Metaphysical," ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'' 14 (Summer 1985): 223–51.&lt;/ref&gt; In it he describes his conception of [[justice]]. It comprises two main principles of [[liberty]] and [[:wikt:equality|equality]]; the second is subdivided into Fair Equality of Opportunity and the Difference Principle.

Rawls arranges the principles in 'lexical priority', prioritising in the order of the Liberty Principle, Fair Equality of Opportunity and the Difference Principle. This order determines the priorities of the principles if they conflict in practice. The principles are, however, intended as a single, comprehensive conception of justice—'Justice as Fairness'—and not to function individually. These principles are always applied so as to ensure that the "least advantaged" are benefitted and not hurt or forgotten.

Rawls presented the theory in the famous ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', subsequently revising it in ''[[Political Liberalism]]''.

==First principle: the liberty principle==
The first and most important principle states that every individual has an equal right to basic liberties, Rawls claiming "that certain rights and freedoms are more important or 'basic' than others".&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2007:45&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Freeman argues, Rawls believes that "personal property" – personal belongings, a home – constitutes a basic liberty, but an absolute right to unlimited private property is not.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2007:50&lt;/ref&gt; As basic liberties, these rights are inalienable: no government can amend, infringe or remove such rights from individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman 2007:51&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Mertens says Rawls contends that principles for a society are just when chosen by representative citizens placed within "fair" conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Follesdal|first1=ed. by Andreas|last2=Pogge|first2=Thomas|last3=Mertens|first3=Thomas|title=Real world justice : grounds, principles, human rights, and social institutions|date=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9781402031410|page=86|url=http://thomaspogge.com/books/real-world-justice/|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', Rawls articulates the Liberty Principle as the most extensive basic liberty compatible with similar liberty for others; he later amended this in ''[[Political Liberalism]]'', stating instead that "each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties".&lt;ref&gt;Rawls 2005:5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second principle: the equality principle==
The Equality Principle is the component of Justice as Fairness establishing [[distributive justice]]. Rawls awards the Fair Equality of Opportunity Principle lexical priority over the Difference Principle: a society cannot arrange inequalities to maximize the share of the least advantaged whilst not allowing access to certain offices or positions.

===Fair equality of opportunity===
This principle maintains that "offices and positions"&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2010:86&lt;/ref&gt; should be open to any individual, regardless of his or her social background, ethnicity or sex. It is stronger than 'Formal Equality of Opportunity' in that Rawls argues that an individual should not only have the ''right'' to opportunities, but should have an ''effective'' equal chance as another of similar natural ability.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, 2008: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equal-opportunity/#2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference principle===
The Difference Principle regulates inequalities: it only permits inequalities that work to the advantage of the worst-off. This is often misinterpreted as [[trickle-down economics]]; Rawls' argument is more accurately expressed as a system where wealth "diffuses up".&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2010:291–92 &amp; 222–23&lt;/ref&gt; By guaranteeing the worst-off in society a fair deal, Rawls compensates for naturally occurring inequalities (talents that one is born with, such as a capacity for sport).

Rawls justifies the Difference Principle on the basis that, since Fair Equality of Opportunity has lexical priority, the Just choice from [[Pareto optimal]] scenarios which could occur would be that benefiting the worst-off rather than the best-off.

==Original position==
{{main|Original position}}
A key component of Rawls' argument is his claim that his Principles of Justice would be chosen by parties in the [[original position]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2009: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[thought experiment]] in which the parties select principles that will determine the basic structure of the society they will live in. This choice is made from behind a [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]], which would deprive participants of information about their particular characteristics: his or her ethnicity, social status, gender and, crucially,  their conception of The Good. This forces participants to select principles impartially and rationally.

'''''Lila: An Inquiry into Morals''''' (1991) is the second [[philosophical fiction|philosophical novel]] by [[Robert M. Pirsig]], who is best known for  ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]''. ''Lila: An Inquiry into Morals'' was a nominated finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="Pulitzer"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Fiction | title=The Pulitzer Prizes &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Fiction | accessdate=2008-10-02 | publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This semi-autobiographical story takes place in the autumn as the author sails his boat down the [[Hudson River]]. Phaedrus, the author's [[alter ego]], is jarred out of his solitary routine by an encounter with Lila, a straightforward but troubled woman who is nearing a mental breakdown.

==Major themes==
The main goal of this book is to develop a complete [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] system based on [[Pirsig's metaphysics of Quality|the idea of Quality introduced in his first book]].  As in his previous book, the narrative is embedded between rounds of [[Philosophy|philosophical]] discussion. Unlike his previous book, in which he creates a dichotomy between Classical and Romantic Quality, this book centers on the division of Quality into the Static and the Dynamic. According to the novel, the known universe can be divided into four Static values: inorganic, biological, social, and intellectual. Everything in the known universe can be categorized into one of these four categories, except Dynamic Quality. Because Dynamic Quality is indefinable, the novel discusses the interactions between the four Static values and the Static values themselves.

Another goal of this book is to critique the field of [[anthropology]].  Pirsig claims traditional [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] renders the field ineffective. He then turns his concept of Quality toward an explanation of the difficulties [[Western world|Western society]] has had in understanding the values and perspectives of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. One interesting conclusion is that [[Culture of the United States|modern American culture]] is the result of a melding of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[Europe]]an values.

Another theme analyzed using the [[Pirsig's metaphysics of Quality|Metaphysics of Quality]] is the interaction between [[intellectual]] and [[social]] [[pattern]]s. Pirsig states that until the end of the [[Victorian era]], social patterns dominated the conduct of members of the [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]. In the aftermath of [[World War I]], intellectual patterns and the [[scientific method]] acceded to that position, becoming responsible for directing the nation's goals and actions. The later occurrences of [[fascism]] are seen as an [[Anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]] struggle to return social patterns to the dominant position. The [[hippie]] movement, having perceived the flaws inherent in both social and intellectual patterns, sought to transcend them, but failed to provide a stable replacement, degenerating instead into lower level [[nature|biological]] patterns as noted in its calls for [[free love]].

==Name inspiration==

Although Pirsig attended graduate studies of [[Hindu philosophy]] at [[Banaras Hindu University]] and also attended [[Ramlila]] celebrations in India, the name of the female character is only accidentally the same as the Hindu concept of [[Lila (Hinduism)|Lila]]. "I asked Pirsig ... he said it was like 'lilac,' and that, 'it was the unsubtlety of the [[Common Lilac|lilac]] odour and the hardiness of the bush that helped suggest her name to me.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Reception ==
In an interview, the author said that he was disappointed that more 'seriously thinking people' did not really understand his ideas entirely. Many people, he said, wrote to him that they re-read the book many times but still didn't really understand it, adding "I have read many reviews criticizing my ideas, but I have yet to see anything that proves me wrong. I'd like to give a prize to the first person who can convince me that my ideas about a metaphysics of quality are wrong."&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4612367 | title=Robert Pirsig Discusses 'Lila: An Inquiry into Morals' | date=2005-04-21 | accessdate=2008-10-02 | publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;!--you will never understand the book unless you morally challenge it, and engendering that moral challenge is part of the book when he talks about "spare the rod, spoil the child".--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15684">[[Image:LindisfarneChapel.jpg|thumb|300 px|The Lindisfarne chapel in [[Crestone, Colorado]]]]The '''Lindisfarne Association''' (1972–2012)  was a nonprofit foundation and diverse group of intellectuals organized by [[cultural history|cultural historian]] [[William Irwin Thompson]] for the "study and realization of a new planetary culture".

It was inspired by the philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s idea of an integral [[philosophy of organism]], and by [[Teilhard de Chardin]]'s idea of planetization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/22/books/books-of-the-times-books-of-the-times.html?&amp;pagewanted=all |title= Books Of The Times: Review of THE TIME FALLING BODIES TAKE TO LIGHT. Mythology, Sexuality, and the Origins of Culture. |last1=Lehmann-Haupt  |first1=Christopher |last2= |first2= |date=January 22, 1981 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |access-date=November 13, 2015 |quote=In the meantime, Mr. Thompson has become the founding director of the wellknown Lindisfarne Association, which his biographical blurb describes as &lt;nowiki&gt;'a contemplative education community devoted to the study and realization of a new planetary culture.'&lt;/nowiki&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Thompson conceived the idea for the Lindisfarne association while touring spiritual sites and experimental communities around the world. The Lindisfarne Association is named for Lindisfarne Priory—a monastery, known for the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], founded on the British island of [[Lindisfarne]] in the 7th century.

Advertising executive Gene Fairly had just left his position at [[Interpublic Group of Companies]] and begun studying [[Zen Buddhism]] when he read a review of Thompson's ''At the Edge of History'' in the ''New York Times''. Fairly visited Thompson at [[York University]] in Toronto to discuss forming a group for the promotion of planetary culture. Upon returning to New York he raised $150,000 from such donors as [[Nancy Wilson Ross]] and Sydney and Jean Lanier. Support from these donors served as an entrée to the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;Helgesen (1977), p. 84. "Fairly went back to New York to use his connections to raise money for the project. He says he stirred the interest of Nancy Wilson Ross at the Asia Society; Mrs. Stanley Young, a wealthy woman interested in Zen Buddhism; and Jean and Sidney Lanier, hiers of the poet and funders of the now-defunct Finca La Folenca. a mini-Esalen in Southern France where the Laniers had established themselves as unofficial gurus. Mrs. Lanier is known in fund-seeking circles as a key to the Rockefeller Brothers fund, so that door was opened, and between these groups Fairly says he put together $150,000 to set things going." See poet [[Sidney Lanier]] (1842–1881); and the [[Asia Society]], founded 1956 by [[John D. Rockefeller III]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incorporation and first years in New York ===

Lindisfarne was incorporated as a non-profit educational foundation in December 1972. It began operations at a refitted summer camp in [[Southampton, New York]] on August 31, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Collins (1982), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1974–1977 Lindisfarne held an annual conference "to explore the new planetary culture" with the following themes:&lt;ref&gt;Collins (1982), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Planetary Culture and the New Image of Humanity, 1974
* Conscious Evolution and the Evolution of Consciousness, 1975
* A Light Governance for America: the Cultures and Strategies of Decentralization, 1976
* Mind in Nature, 1977

''Earth's answer : explorations of planetary culture at the Lindisfarne conferences'' (1977) reprints some of the lectures given at the 1974 and 1975 conferences.

The Lindisfarne Association was first based in Southampton, New York in 1973 and then in Manhattan at the [[Church of the Holy Communion and Buildings]] which was leased to Lindisfarne from 1976–1979.

=== Move to Crestone and formation of other branches ===
As Lindisfarne began to run low on funding, it faced the loss of its lease on the Church of the Holy Communion. At a conference at the [[New Alchemy Institute]] in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, [[Petro-Canada]] CEO and [[United Nations]] official [[Maurice Strong]] offered to donate land from [[Luis Maria Baca Grant No. 4|his ranch]] in [[Crestone, Colorado]]. Thompson chose 77 acres of land near Spanish Creek—self-reportedly because his "Irish Druid Radar" had gone off while driving past—where Lindisfarne began to construct new buildings for its purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Collins (1982), pp. 24–25, 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today the Lindisfarne Fellows House, the Lindisfarne Chapel, and the Lindisfarne Mountain Retreat are under the ownership and management of the [[Crestone Mountain Zen Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lindisfarne Tapes|url=http://www.centerforneweconomics.org/content/lindisfarne-tapes|publisher=Schumacher Center for a New Economics|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lindisfarne has functioned variously as a sponsor of classes, conferences, and concerts and public lectures events, and as a [[think tank]] and retreat, similar to the [[Esalen Institute]] in [[California]]. Lindisfarne functioned as  a not-for-profit foundation until 2009; the Lindisfarne Fellowship continued to hold annual meetings until 2012. It is no longer an active organization.

In addition to its facility in Crestone (the "Lindisfarne Mountain Retreat"), three other branches of the organization were formed:&lt;ref name=Redenius254&gt;Redenius (1985), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* a headquarters in New York City at the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine|Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine]];
* the Lindisfarne Press was established in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]]; and
* the Lindisfarne Fellows House was opened at the [[San Francisco Zen Center]].

==Goals and doctrine==
The Lindisfarne doctrine is closely related to that of its founder, William Thompson. Mentioned as part of the Lindisfarne ideology are a long list of spiritual and [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] traditions including [[yoga]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Chinese traditional medicine]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Celtic animism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Kabbalah|cabala]], [[geomancy]], [[ley lines]], [[Pythagoreanism]], and ancient [[mystery religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Collins (1982), pp. 14–18. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group placed a special emphasis on [[sacred geometry]], defined by Thompson as "a vision of divine intelligence, the logos, revealing itself in all forms, from the logarithmic spiral of a seashell to the hexagonal patterns of cooling basalt, from the architecture of the molecule to the galaxy."&lt;ref&gt;William Irwin Thompson, ''Darkness and Scattered Light'' (1978), p. 138; quoted in Collins (1982), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Fletcher, [[Robert Lawlor]], and [[Keith Critchlow]] lectured at Crestone on the application of sacred geometry, Platonism, and Pythagoreanism to architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Collins (1982), p. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The exemplar of these ideas is the Grail Chapel in Crestone (also known as Lindisfarne Chapel), which is built to reflect numerous basic geometrical relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Collins (1982), pp. 55–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindisfarne's social agenda was exemplified by the "meta-industrial village", a small community focused on subsistence and crafts while yet connected to a world culture. All members of a community might participate in essential tasks such as the harvest. (Thompson has speculated that the United States, 40% of the population could work at agriculture, and another 40% in social services.) The villages would have a sense of shared purpose in transforming world culture. They would combine "the four classical economies of human history, hunting and gathering, agriculture, industry, and cybernetics", all "recapitulated within a single deme."&lt;ref&gt;Collins (1982), pp. 127–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

(The "Meadowcreek Project" in Arkansas, begun in 1979 by David and Wilson Orr, was an effort to actualize a meta-industrial village as envisioned by the Lindisfarne Association. This project received funding from the [[Ozarks Regional Commission]], the Arkansas Energy Department, and the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation.)&lt;ref&gt;Collins (1982), pp. 134–136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.motherearthnews.com/nature-and-environment/sustainability-model-zmaz82mazglo The Meadowcreek Project: A Model of Sustainability in the Ozarks]", ''Mother Earth News'', March/April 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The villages would be linked together by an electronic information network (i.e., what today we call the [[internet]]). Thompson called for a counter-cultural vanguard "which can formulate an integral vision of culture and maintain the high standards of that culture without compromise to the forces of electronic vulgarization." &lt;ref&gt;William Irwin Thompson, ''Darkness and Scattered Light'' (1978), pp. 71–72; quoted in Collins (1982), p. 113; and Collins pp. 118–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Lindisfarne Association website, Lindisfarne's fourfold goals are:
# The Planetization of the Esoteric 
# The realization of the inner harmony of all the great universal religions and the spiritual traditions of the tribal peoples of the world.  
# The fostering of a new and healthier balance between nature and culture through the research and development of appropriate technologies, architectural settlements and compassionate economies for meta-industrial villages and convivial cities.
# The illumination of the spiritual foundations of political governance through scholarship and artistic communications that foster a global ecology of consciousness beyond the present ideological systems of warring industrial nation-states, outraged traditional societies, and ravaged lands and seas.

Thompson has also stated the United States has a unique role to play in the promotion of planetary culture because people from all over the world mingle there.&lt;ref&gt;Redenius (1985), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindisfarne sought to spread its message widely, through a mailing list and through book publications of the Lindisfarne press.&lt;ref&gt;Redenius (1985), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Sally Helgesen, after a visit in 1977, criticized Lindisfarne as confused pseudo-intellectuals, citing for example their attempt to build an expensive fish "bioshelter" while overlooking a marsh with fish in it.&lt;ref&gt;Helgesen (1977), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Magnolia CMS is a Java-based content management system that uses a [[content repository API for Java|JCR]] repository to store, retrieve and search data. In this respect Magnolia is similar to Adobe Experience Manager, Hippo CMS and Jahia which also use JCR. Magnolia uses Apache Jackrabbit, the JCR reference implementation by default. It is possible to use another JSR-170 certified repository implementation such as [[Content repository API for Java#Available implementations|Modeshape]].

===Persistent storage===
In Magnolia, Jackrabbit persists data to the [[H2 (DBMS)|H2]] database by default. A light-weight embedded H2 database contains the Magnolia software, configuration, and two demonstration websites in a single download for trying out the system. For production environments other databases such as MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL or Oracle can be used.

===Instances===
Magnolia CMS is distributed as two [[web application]]s: an author instance and a public instance. Editors work on the author instance which typically resides in a secure location behind a firewall, inaccessible from the Internet. Editors publish content to a public instance which serves the content to visitors on the Web. The public instance resides in a location that can be reached from the Internet or an intranet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hietala|first1=Antti|title=Instances|url=https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS/Instances|website=Magnolia Documentation|publisher=Magnolia International Ltd.|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical Magnolia CMS production setup consists of at least two public instances. More instances can be created to meet site load and availability needs.

==Modules==
Magnolia CMS has a modular architecture. The system core and features such as the page editor, digital asset management and cache are packaged into separate modules. The module mechanism is also used to package and deploy websites built with Magnolia CMS. The templates, themes and functionality used on a website are split into separate modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meier|first1=Christoph|title=Modules|url=https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS/Modules|website=Magnolia Documentation|publisher=Magnolia International Ltd.|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modularity allows site administrators to install and uninstall functionality according to a project's requirements. Encapsulating functionality into discrete modules also promotes [[separation of concerns]]: one team can work on website templates while another team develops apps, for example.

At the file system level a Magnolia module is a [[JAR (file format)|JAR]], a Java file format used to package Java class files and resources (images, CSS, JavaScript) into one file. Deploying a Magnolia module involves copying the JAR file into the Java application server and restarting the Magnolia instance. Magnolia CMS recognizes the JAR file during the startup process and installs the module.

Magnolia International Ltd. provides commonly used feature modules such as Commenting and Personalization. The user community has developed further modules for specific tasks such as for checking broken links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kerkhoff|first1=Marvin|title=Deadlink App|url=https://wiki.magnolia-cms.com/display/WIKI/Deadlink+App|website=Magnolia Community Wiki|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Users==
Magnolia clients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=References|url=https://www.magnolia-cms.com/clients/references.html|publisher=Magnolia International Ltd.|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; come primarily from financial services, government and media. The system is best suited for organizations that have complex integration requirements and sufficient IT resources to customize the product to their needs. Significant Java expertise is needed to take advantage of Magnolia's open-source architecture and to integrate the CMS with existing systems. The company has indicated that a file-system based development approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meier|first1=Christoph |date=2015-07-03 |title=Release notes for Magnolia 5.4|url=https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS/Release+notes+for+Magnolia+5.4|website=Magnolia Documentation|publisher=Magnolia International Ltd.|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes the product less demanding of Java skills.

==Conference==
Magnolia Conference is an annual event for CMS developers and digital marketing users. The conference is a place to meet other users, share best practices, and learn about product updates. A technical presentation track targets software developers, focusing on integrations and CMS implementation cases. In 2015, Magnolia added a digital business presentation track where talks focus on content challenges that businesses are facing and how they are using the product build their brands on the Web.

The conference also includes a community [[unconference]] where attendees themselves are responsible for proposing, voting for and presenting talks which everyone is free to choose to attend.

'''Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen''' (born 1951), is Professor of [[Comparative Literature]] and [[French language|French]] at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref name="WashUni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/complit/people/faculty/borch-jacobsen.htm |title=People - Faculty - Borch-Jacobsen |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |accessdate=8 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204143935/http://depts.washington.edu/complit/people/faculty/borch-jacobsen.htm |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Born to [[Denmark|Danish]] parents, he began his studies in [[France]] and emigrated to the United States in 1986. He is the author of many works on the history and philosophy of [[psychiatry]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[hypnosis]]. His [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] analysis of the co-production of psychical "facts" emphasises the accuracy of historical accounts of [[mental disorder]]s. He is known for his positions in virulent debates about psychoanalysis&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; called the ''Freud Wars''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; especially with regard to his 2005 publication of ''Le Livre noir de la psychanalyse'' ("The Black Book of Psychoanalysis"). In a review entitled ''Folies à plusieurs. De l'hystérie à la dépression'' ("Many madnesses. From hysteria to depression"), [[Pierre-Henri Castel]] calls Borch-Jacobsen "one of the most polemic thinkers with regard to the ''Freud Wars''".&lt;ref name="Castel"&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Folies à plusieurs. De l'hystérie à la dépression'' ("Many madnesses. From hysteria to depression")|last=Castel|first=Pierre-Henri|authorlink=Pierre-Henri Castel|journal=Revue d’histoire des sciences humaines|volume=2003/1|issue=8|pages=161&amp;ndash;177|url=http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=RHSH&amp;ID_NUMPUBLIE=RHSH_008&amp;ID_ARTICLE=RHSH_008_0161|language=French|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Borch-Jacobsen studied [[philosophy]] with [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]] and [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], two philosophers close in thought to, and in dialogue with, [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Jacques Lacan]].

In 1981 at the [[University of Strasbourg]] he submitted his doctoral dissertation on ''The Freudian Subject''&lt;ref name="WashUni"/&gt; and then began teaching in the department of [[Psychoanalysis]] at [[Paris 8 University|Vincennes University in Paris]], where [[Jacques Lacan]] had first made his mark.

In 1986 he emigrated to the United States.

==Criticism of psychoanalysis==

===Hypnosis===
In 1983, Borch-Jacobsen participated in a meeting on the subject of [[hypnosis]] at the [[Hôpital Fernand-Widal]] where he joined such other as [[Léon Chertok]], [[René Girard]] and [[François Roustang]] in the discussion of [[hypnosis]]. The following year, he published with Éric Michaud and [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], ''Hypnoses''. In this book, the authors consider the whole history of therapeutic [[hypnosis]], the [[psychology|psychological]] or [[sociology|sociological]] theory becoming suspect to dangerous regressions from intellectual, ethical and political ideas.&lt;ref name="Béheust"&gt;{{citation|first=Bertrand|last=Méheust|title=Somnambulisme et médiumnité |trans-title=Sleepwalking and mediiumship |publisher=Les Empêcheurs de penser en rond|year=1999|page=293|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January 1985, he presented a conference paper entitled "L'hypnose dans la psychanalyse" ("Hypnosis in psychoanalysis") to the Society of Psychosomatic Medicine. The text of this paper was then published in collaboration with Chertok in 1987, with replies from many psychoanalysists, philosophers and sociologists, such as [[Georges Lapassade]], [[Octave Mannoni]] and [[Franklin Rausky]].

In this paper, Borch-Jacobsen presented evidence that psychoanalytic [[transference]] is a form of [[altered state of consciousness]], comparable with those that had existed in the work of pschotherapies which predate psychoanalysis, from [[Shamanism]] to the hypnotism of the [[Nancy School]], by way of [[animal magnetism]]. He averred that "{{lang|fr|le phénomène du transfert n'est rien d'autre, de l'aveu même de Freud, que le resurgissement, au sein du dispositif analytique, de la relation (du « rapport ») caractéristique du dispositif hypnotique : dépendance, soumission ou encore… valorisation exclusive de la personne du médecin}}" ("On Freud's own admission, the phenomenon of transference is nothing other than the resurgence, in the bosom of [psycho]analytical techniques, of the characteristic relationship (of 'rapport') of hypnosis techniques: dependence, submission, or again... exclusive worship of the doctor").&lt;ref name="HandP"&gt;{{citation|first=Mikkel|last=Borch-Jacobsen|title=Hypnose et psychanalyse |trans-title=Hypnosis and psychoanalysis |publisher=Dunod|year=1987|page=45|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasised that there is consequently an important risk of [[suggestion]] on the part of the psychoanalyst, even more so when the psychoanalyst himself is not conscious of these phenomena.

Borch-Jacobsen then reaffirmed that [[Sigmund Freud]], after having started to use suggestive hypnotic psychotherapy on [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] in 1887 replaced it with the cathartic method in 1899, no longer using hypnosis as a means of direct suggestion, but to bring out suppressed feelings of patients' traumas. After practicing using [[free association (psychology)|free association]] in 1892, Freud totally abandoned hypnosis at the end of 1896. This is explained in the following manner by Chertok: "{{lang|fr|Par opposition à l'hypnose, Freud avait cru fonder une psychothérapie scientifique, destinée, comme telle, à devenir la psychothérapie par excellence. L'interprétation et la prise de conscience y constituaient le pivot de la cure. L'affectivité ne pouvait certes pas être éliminée de la nouvelle méthode mais elle se trouvait canalisée dans le transfert, et par là, dominée et mise au service de la connaissance. Telle était l'ambition du fondateur de la psychanalyse, en cette fin de siècle encore toute imprégnée d'esprit positiviste}}" ("In his opposition to hypnosis, Freud was known to have founded a scientific [[psychotherapy]], destined, as such, to become the psychotherapy ''par excellence''. The interpretation and the capture of consciousness thus becomes the fulcrum of the cure. The effectiveness of the new method certainly could not be discounted, but in it one can find it being channelled into transference, and by that, come to dominate the consciousness and put it to work.  Such was the ambition of the Founder of Psychoanalysis [Freud], and the turn of the century was once again filled with positivity").&lt;ref name="Chertok"&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Léon Chertok|first=Léon|last=Cherok|title=Hypnose et psychanalyse|trans-title=Hypnosis and psychotherapy |publisher=Dunod|year=1987|page=2|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is precisely this posture of Freud's that the consciousness is "dominated" that was put into question by Borch-Jacobsen.

[[Bertrand Méheust]] rebuked Borch-Jacobsen for accepting without further discussion a dated view of hypnotherapy, bequeathed by the positivist institutional medicine of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Méheust, p.&amp;nbsp;31&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he argues that hypnosis follows a state of absolute passivity and therefore hurts well-being, and that hypnosis is induced in someone in which all consciousness is disconnected, a being totally immersed in the inner self, indeed a puppet who thinks and lives totally by the workings of another.&lt;ref&gt;Méheust, p.&amp;nbsp;292&lt;/ref&gt; He takes sides with [[Armand Marie Jacques de Chastenet de Puységur]] and [[Joseph Philippe François Deleuze]], stating that lucid, [[animal magnetism|magnetic]] phenomena are assumed to establish a kind of [[synergy]] between the higher functions of intelligence and the immediacy of instinct.

=== The case of Anna O. ===
In 1996 he completed a treatise on the case of [[Bertha Pappenheim]], "Anna O.", subtitled {{lang|fr|Une mystification centenaire}} ("A 100-year-old mystery"), in which, according to Claude Meyer, he "{{lang|fr|met un terme à l'un des mythes fondateurs de la psychanalyse}}" ("put an end to one of the founding myths of psychoanalysis").&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Claude Meyer|first=Claude|last=Meyer|title=Une histoire des représentations.

=== ''Le Livre noir de la psychanalyse'' ===
In 2005 he collaborated in writing {{lang|fr|Le Livre noir de la psychanalyse}} ("The Black Book of Psychoanalysis"), a book which received a great reception and has been the subject of several commentaries.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

'''Nicholas Leonicus Thomaeus''' ({{lang-it|Niccolò Leonico Tomeo}}, {{lang-el|Νικόλαος Λεόνικος Θωμεύς}}; 1456–1531) was a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] scholar and professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Padua]]. He was one of the first professors of Greek descent to teach Greek in [[Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1985|p=212: "The University of Padua was one of the first to encourage the study of Greek; and Greeks who could lecture on Greek texts were especially welcome. A Chair of Greek was founded there in 1463 and given to the Athenian Demetrius Chalcondylas. One of his successors, Nicholas Laonicus Thomaeus, an Epirot by birth, gave in 1497 a course of lectures on Aristotle, using only the Greek text and a few Alexandrian commentaries."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Copenhaver-Schmidt&gt;{{harvnb|Copenhaver|Schmidt|1992|p=104: "A few years later, cracks in the fortress of Latin Aristotelianism at Padua encouraged the hiring of Niccolò Leonico Tomeo, an Italian-born Greek, to lecture on the Greek Aristotle."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though elected to succeed Giorgio *Valla in the chair of Greek in Venice itself during 1504, he does not appear to have taken the post up seriously and was superseded by *Musurus in 1512.

'''Nicola Antonio Stigliola''' (Also: Colantonio Stelliola) (1546 [[Nola]] &amp;ndash; 1623 [[Naples]]) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[philosopher]], [[printer (publisher)|printer]], [[architect]], and [[physician|medical doctor]]. He was a friend to [[Tommaso Campanella]] and [[Giordano Bruno]] and a member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].

He was an adherent of Copernican heliocentrism and of Bruno's ideas on Hermeticism and magic. He believed in the complex Pythagorean and Brunian cosmologies, including the view that the planets and stars were like the earth, covered in plants and animals:
"Stigliola said to me...that it seemed irrational to him that bodies so much larger than the earth and the space between the centre of the earth to the moon should be composed simply of idle fire, and not instead of all manner of elements and plants and animals and men, just as our countryman Philolaus held."&lt;ref&gt;Tommaso Campanella: The Book and the Body of Nature by Germana Ernst, p17; quoting Campanella's Metaphysica, III, p52.&lt;/ref&gt;
Indeed, Stigliola and Bruno were born just two years apart in the same region of southern Italy, Nola, and in the same town of Monte Cicala.&lt;ref&gt;The New Light of Europe: Giordano Bruno and the Modern Age; Dissertation by Geoffrey McTighe, Dept Phil, University of NC, Chapel Hill; p125&lt;/ref&gt;

Early studies and life in Naples
Stigliola studied medicine at the University of Salerno, gaining his degree in 1571, after which he lived in Naples. There, he published "Theriace et Mithridatia Libellus" (1577), a polemic defending his teacher Maranta on the use of theria (a subclass of mammals), against the medical school at Padua - an effort that meant he could not progress as a medical student.&lt;ref&gt;McTighe, Op. cit., p124&lt;/ref&gt;
Instead, he turned his attentions to architecture and teaching. He became, in the 1580s, topographer to the city of Naples, and developed new plans for the city's port and city wall, neither of which were implemented.&lt;ref&gt;McTighe, Op. cit., p124&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he turned to teaching, perhaps medicine as well as architecture. He was said to have had, at one time, 400 students.&lt;ref&gt;McTighe, Op. cit., p124.&lt;/ref&gt;
He also turned his hand to the very risky business of printing, establishing a press on the Porta Reale from 1593 to 1606. Eighty-two of these printed works are known today and the press was "one of the greatest of his day".&lt;ref&gt;McTighe, Op. cit., p125.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was tried for heresy in Naples in 1595.&lt;ref&gt;McTighe, Op. cit., p125.&lt;/ref&gt;

His epitaph, in part, reads:
TO THE MEMBER OF THE LYNCEAN ACADEMY,
NICOLA ANTONIO STIGLIOLA,
NOT ONLY A PHILOSOPHER, BUT DISTINGUISHED
IN ALL THE LIBERAL ARTS
IN ADDITION TO THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES, POLITICS, ETHICS, 
ARCHITECTURE, MILITARY ARTS, AND
ALL THAT PERTAINS TO THE PYTHAGOREAN SCIENCES
ENDED HIS CAREER AS THE SUPREME MATHEMATICIAN
IN THE CITY OF PARTHENOPE
AT THE AGE OF NEARLY EIGHTY YEARS
ON APRIL 11, 1623...&lt;ref&gt;McTighe, Op. cit., p124. Parthenope was the ancient Greek district of Naples.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are works by Stigliola:
''Theriace et Mithridatia Libellus'' (1577)
''De gli elementi mechanici'' (1597)
''Telescopio, over ispecillo celeste'' (1627 posth.)
''Encyclopedia pythagorea'' (1616) [Only the index and section ''Delle apparenze celesti'' (1616) are believed to exist]

{{Judaism}}

'''Orthodox Jewish philosophy''' comprises the philosophical and theological teachings of [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Though Orthodox Judaism sees itself as the heir of traditional rabbinic Judaism, the present-day movement is thought to have first formed in the late 18th&amp;nbsp;century, mainly in reaction to the [[Jewish emancipation]] and the growth of the [[Haskalah]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalho, Jean-Paul, and Mark Koyama. ''Development and religious polarization: The emergence of reform and ultra-Orthodox Judaism''. Department of Economics, University of Oxford, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heilman, Samuel C. ''Cosmopolitans and Parochials: Modern Orthodox Jews in America''. University of Chicago Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liebman, Charles S. The ambivalent American Jew: Politics, religion and family in American Jewish life. Jewish publication society of America, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox Jewish philosophy concerns itself with interpreting traditional Jewish sources, reconciling the Jewish faith with the changes in the modern world and the movement's relationships with the [[State of Israel]] and other Jewish denominations.

==Philosophies==
Specific philosophies developed by Orthodox Jewish thinkers include:
* [[Torah Judaism]], an ideological concept used to legitimize Jewish movements within the framework of Orthodox Jewish values.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, Shimon.

[[File:Flag of the UNIA.svg|thumb|250px|The red, black, and green Black Liberation  flag (not to be confused with the [[Pan-African colours|Pan-African flag]]) designed by the [[UNIA]] in 1920.]] 
{{Pan-African}}
The '''Black Liberation flag''' also known as the '''UNIA flag''', '''Afro-American flag''', '''Black Liberation Flag''' and [[#Alternative names|various other names]]—is a [[tri-color flag]] consisting of three equal horizontal bands of (from top down) [[red]], [[black]] and [[green]]. The [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] (UNIA-ACL) formally adopted it on August 13, 1920 in Article 39 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World]], during its month-long convention at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;25,000 NEGROES CONVENE :International Gathering Will Prepare Own Bill of Rights. 1920. New York Times (1857-Current file), August 2,  [http://www.proquest.com/ Proquest] (Last accessed October 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Special to The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' from its Eastern News Office 1920. NEGROES ADOPT BILL OF RIGHTS: Convention Approves Plan for African Republic and Sets to Work on Preparation of Constitution of the Colored Race Negro Complaints Aggression Condemned Recognition Demanded. ''Christian Science Monitor'' (1908-Current file), August 17,  [http://www.proquest.com/ Proquest] (accessed October 5, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of the flag can and have been used in various countries and territories in the [[Americas]] to represent [[Garveyism|Garveyist]] ideologies.

==History==
[[File:Every race has a flag but the coon.jpg|thumb|Sheet Music for "[[Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon]]"]]
The flag was created in 1920 by members of UNIA in response to the enormously popular 1900 [[coon song]] "[[Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon]]".&lt;ref&gt;"New Flag for Afro-Americans," Africa Times and Orient Review 1 (October 1912):134; Cited in RACE FIRST: The Ideological and Organizational Struggles of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1987), p43.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been cited as one of the three songs that "firmly established the term ''coon'' in the American vocabulary".  In a 1927 report of a 1921 speech appearing in the ''[[Negro World]]'' weekly newspaper, [[Marcus Garvey]] was quoted as saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garvey|first1=Marcus|title=Honorable Marcus Garvey, Gifted Man of Vision, Sets Out In Unanswerable Terms the Reasons Why Negroes Must Build in Africa|work=Negro World|issue=Vol XXII No. 6|publisher=Universal Negro Improvement Association|date=March 19, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Show me the race or the nation without a flag, and I will show you a race of people without any pride. Aye! In song and mimicry they have said, "Every race has a flag but the coon." How true! Aye! But that was said of us four years ago. They can't say it now....}}

The ''Universal Negro [[secular catechism|Catechism]]'', published by the UNIA in 1921, refers to the colors of the flag meaning:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mcguire|first1=George|title=Universal Negro catechism: a course of instruction in religious and historical knowledge pertaining to the race.|date=1921|publisher=Universal Negro Improvement Association|location=New York|page=34|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/emu.010000685445?urlappend=%3Bseq=34|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Red is the color of the blood which men must shed for their redemption and liberty; black is the color of the noble and distinguished race to which we belong; green is the color of the luxuriant vegetation of our Motherland.}}

Journalist Charles Mowbray White has asserted that Garvey proposed the colors red, black and green for the following reasons: "Garvey said red because of sympathy for the 'Reds of the world', and the Green their sympathy for the [[Irish War of Independence|Irish in their fight for freedom]], and the Black [for] the Negro."&lt;ref&gt;''Garvey Papers'' Vol. 2, p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UNIA as of recent; the three colors on the Black Nationalist flag represent:
* red: the blood that unites all people of Black African ancestry, and shed for liberation;
* black: black people whose existence as a nation, though not a nation-state, is affirmed by the existence of the flag; and
* green: the abundant natural wealth of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History - Red-Black-Green|url=http://www.theunia-acl.com/index.php/history-red-black-green|website=The Universal Negro Improvement Association|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag later became a Black Nationalist symbol for the worldwide liberation of Black people. As an emblem of [[Black pride]], the flag became popular during the [[Black Liberation]] movement of the 1960s. In 1971, the school board of [[Newark, New Jersey]], passed a resolution permitting the flag to be raised in public school classrooms. Four of the board's nine members were not present at the time, and the resolution was introduced by the board's teen member, a mayoral appointee. Fierce controversy ensued, including a court order that the board show cause why they should not be forced to rescind the resolution, and at least two state legislative proposals to ban [[ethnic flag]]s and national flags (other than the U.S. flag) in public classrooms.

In the United States, the flag is presently widely available through flag shops or ethnic specialty stores. It is commonly seen at parades commemorating [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]], [[civil rights]] rallies, and other special events.

===2010s usage===
In the United States, following the refusal of a grand jury to indict a police officer in the August 9, 2014 [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], a [[Howard University]] student replaced the U.S. flag on that school's [[Washington, DC]] campus flagpole with a Black Nationalist flag flying at half-mast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/Chinonyeezy/status/537279736133980160 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313022654/https://twitter.com/chinonyeezy/status/537279736133980160 |archivedate=2015-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2014/11/29/howard-university-president-removes-pan-african-flag-flown-at-half-mast/ |title=Howard University President Removes Pan-African Flag Flown at Half-Mast &amp;#124; DC Inno |website=Dcinno.streetwise.co |date=2014-11-25 |accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident resulted in the university president, Wayne Frederick, issuing a statement disapproving the flag-raising by unauthorized personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaschik |first=Scott |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/12/01/howard-u-president-issues-statement-flag-protest |title=Howard U.

==Alternative names==
The flag goes by several other names with varying degrees of popularity:
*the '''[[Universal Negro Improvement Association|UNIA]] flag''', after its originators;
*the '''Marcus Garvey''' flag;
*the '''Universal African''' flag;
*the '''International African''' flag;
*the '''Black Liberation''' flag;
*the '''Black Nationalist''' flag;
*the '''African Nationalist''' flag;
*the '''Afro-American flag''' flag;
*the '''Bendera Ya Taifa''' ([[Kiswahili]] for "flag of the Nation"), in reference to its usage during [[Kwanzaa]].

==Derivative flags==
[[Image:RNA Flag 08I09.svg|right|135px|thumb|right|Flag of the [[Republic of New Afrika]]]]
The [[African National Congress]] flag is three horizontal stripes, descending black, green, and dark yellow (gold).
The [[United States Postal Service]] issued a stamp in 1997 to commemorate [[Kwanzaa]] with a painting by fine artist [[Synthia Saint James]] of a dark-skinned family wearing garments traditional in parts of Africa and fashionable for special occasions among African-Americans.  The family members are holding food, gifts, and a flag.  The flag in the stamp may have been meant to represent the Pan-African flag, However, instead of the stripes descending red, black, and green, the stamp's flag transposes the top two bands and descends black, red, and green.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

In 2000, artist [[David Hammons]] created a work called ''African-American Flag'', which is held by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. Based on the standard U.S. flag, its stripes are black and red, the field is green, and the stars on the field are black.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

In response to the controversy over the flying of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|flag]], an African American-run company called NuSouth&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nusouth.com/&lt;/ref&gt; created a flag based on the Confederate naval jack, with the white stars and saltire outline replaced by green and the blue saltire made black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.photobucket.com/image/nusouth%20apparel%20confederate%20flag/stagolee7/nu-south-conf-flag.jpg?o=1 |title=NuSouth Apparel Confederate Flag Photo by stagolee7 &amp;#124; Photobucket |website=Media.photobucket.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed holiday==
In 1999, an article appeared in the July 25 edition of ''[[The Black World Today]]'' suggesting that, as an act of global solidarity, every August 17 should be celebrated worldwide as Universal African Flag Day by flying the red, black, and green banner. August 17 is the birthday of [[Marcus Garvey]].

The '''Popular Revolutionary Tribunals''' ({{lang-fr|Tribunaux Populaire de la Révolution}}, '''TPR''',&lt;ref name="Vine"&gt;{{cite book |last=Le Vine|first=Victor T.|date=2004|title=Politics in Francophone Africa|location=[[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|page=149|isbn=158-826-249-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively the '''People's Revolutionary Tribunals''') were a system of courts, through which the workers and peasants of [[Burkina Faso]] were intended to be able to participate in and monitor the trials of various enemies of the new [[Marxism|marxist]] and [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africanist]] regime of [[Thomas Sankara]] and his National Council for the Revolution. Among these were members of the previous government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1996|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights|editor1-last=Lawson|editor1-first=Edward H.|editor2-last=Bertucci|editor2-first=Mary Lou|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|page=167|isbn=156-032-362-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; corrupt officials, "lazy workers", and supposed [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kasuka|first=Bridgette|date=2013|title=Prominent African Leaders Since Independence|publisher=Intercontinental Books|page=294|isbn=998-716-026-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sankara came to power in what was then the [[Republic of Upper Volta]] through a military coup in 1983, and immediately set about to transform society through what he dubbed the "Democratic and Popular Revolution" ({{lang-fr|Révolution démocratique et populaire}}). The Popular Revolutionary Tribunals, formed in October 1983,&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rupley|first1=Lawrence|last2=Bangali|first2=Lamissa|last3=Diamitani |first3=Boureima|date=2013|title=Historical Dictionary of Burkina Faso|location=[[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]]|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]]|page=216|isbn=081-088-010-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; were inspired by a number of historical predecessors, among them the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] of the [[French Revolution]] and the "[[Revolutionary tribunal (Russia)|revtribunals]]" of the [[October Revolution]], along with their equivalents during the [[Cuban Revolution]], as well as more directly by the contemporary people's courts established by [[Jerry Rawlings]] in [[Ghana]]. Another important tool of the Burkinabé attempt at a social revolution was the [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (Burkina Faso)|Committees for the Defense of the Revolution]] ({{lang-fr|Comités de Défense de la Révolution}}). The TPRs were made up of magistrates, soldiers, and members of the Committees.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

The tribunals, which have been alleged to have been only [[show trial]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012|chapter=BURKINA FASO: Coups, 1966–1987|title=Encyclopedia of Conflicts since World War II|editor1-last=Ciment|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Hill|editor2-first=Kenneth|location=[[London]]|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=339 |isbn=113-659-621-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; were intended to be held very openly with oversight from the public. Despite this, some of the trials are said to have been held in secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cowell|first=Alan|title=Africa's 'Upright People': Still No Clear Answers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/09/world/africa-s-upright-people-still-no-clear-answers.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=9 January 1985|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TPRs were initially popular with the people, but became heavy-handed and inefficient.&lt;ref name="Vine"/&gt; Sankara himself self-critically admitted that the tribunals often were used as occasions to settle private scores, rather than deal revolutionary justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobs|first=Sean|date=15 October 2008|title=Sankara: daring to invent Africa's future|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/15/thomassankara-burkinafaso|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=[[London]]|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among those tried by the Popular Revolutionary Tribunals was Colonel [[Saye Zerbo]], military ruler and President of Upper Volta between 1980 and 1982, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in May 1984 but released already in August 1985. His conviction would later annulled be 18 February 1997 by the supreme court of Burkina Faso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Décès de Saye Zerbo: L’ancien président, Saye Zerbo, a tiré sa révérence|language=French|url=http://news.aouaga.com/h/13747.html|newspaper=Ouaga|location=[[Ouagadougou]]|date=20 September 2013|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Popular Revolutionary Tribunals, along with the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, were abolished in 1987 after Thomas Sankara's death at the hands of a military coup led by [[Blaise Compaoré]], his former friend and colleague. Compaoré would go on to rule Burkina Faso for 27 years, until his overthrow during the [[2014 Burkinabé uprising]].

'''Pratyaksha''' is one of the three principal means of knowledge, it means that which is present before the eyes clear, distinct and evident.
   '''PRATYKSHA'
'''प्रत्यक्षा माँ दुर्गा का १०८ वा नाम है''' - जिसका मतलब आप जिसके बारे में सोचती है वो आप के समुख हो. और प्रत्यक्षा का मतलब ज्ञान से भी लियागया है


==Meaning==
'''PRATYKSHA &amp; Pratyaksha Both are different Meaning (प्रत्यक्षा &amp;  प्रत्यक्ष)'''

'''Pratyaksha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: प्रत्यक्ष [[IAST]]: pratyakṣa) literally means that which is perceptible to the eye or visible, in general usage it refers to being present, present before the eye i.e. within the range of sight, cognizable by any sense organ, distinct, evident, clear, direct, immediate, explicit, express, corporeal; it is a Pramana, mode of proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=185|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.4.apte.238764}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nyaya]] School recognizes ''Pratyaksha'' (perception) as a kind of ''[[pramana]]'' along with ''[[Anumana]]'' (inference), ''Upamana'' (comparison) and [[Shabda]] (verbal testimony); this school recognizes these four kinds only. The [[Sankhya]] School does not recognize ''Upamana'' as a ''pramana''.  To these four auxiliaries which help illuminate things the [[Vedantins]] and the Mimamsakas also add ''[[Anupalabdhi]]'' (non-apprehension) and ''Arthapatti'' (presumption)as valid ''pramanas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means of knowledge==

''Pratyaksha'' is one of the three principal means of knowledge. The three principal means of knowledge are – 1) ''Anumana'', inference from data, which depends for its value on the possession of the right data, on the right observation of the data including the drawing of the right analogies, the unerring perception of true identity and rejection of false identity, the just estimate of difference and contrast, and on the power of right reasoning from the right data; 2) ''Pratyaksha'' which is the process of collecting and knowing the data, and 3) ''Aptavakya'' which is evidence, the testimony of men in possession of the sought after knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Ashram Publications|page=337|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f4XsuPPjQlIC&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=pratyaksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VhfGU_CONZK2uASs-YEI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=pratyaksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==

''Pratyaksha'' refers to the faculties of perception with which are connected thoughts (''[[Chinta (mentation)|Chinta]]''), imagination (''Kalpana'') and volition (''Praytna''), which four together as ''Chetas'' illuminate the ''[[Mind|Manas]]'', the ordinary mental equipment of the individual, and give awareness or consciousness (''Chetna'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Encyclopaedia|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publications|page=5839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDh2WjvLo7gC&amp;pg=PA5839&amp;dq=chinta+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wtRHU6LbFMaxrgfM94HAAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chinta%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are four types of valid perceptions – a) ''Indriya pratyaksha'' or sense perception, b) ''Manas pratyaksha'' or mental perception, c) ''Svavedana pratyaksha'' or self-consciousness, and d) ''Yoga pratyaksha'' or super normal intuition. In sense perception, which is an indeterminate perception the ''chittashakti'' (intelligence-energy) acts as the substratum of the senses. Mental perception arises when ''chittashakti'', with the aid of ''[[Buddhi]]'', reflects upon objects of senses, and is a determinate perception. Self-consciousness arises when, directed by the ''[[tattvas]]'' or ''panchakoshas'', ''raga'' (attachment), ''vidya'' (knowledge), ''niyati'' (order of things), ''kala'' (time) and ''kalpa'' (the elements) along with pleasure and pain become objects of knowledge to chit, the intelligence of the self. Super normal intuition is gained after removal of impurities cover the intelligent-self through practice of the eight-fold yogic-discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature|author=Mohan Lal|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|pages=3957–3958|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;pg=PA3958&amp;dq=pratyaksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4vXFU8zQFYSGuATJ0YD4BA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=pratyaksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pratyaksha'' knowledge can be gained through a) Worldly pratyaksha, externally through the five senses and internally through mind, and b) Transcendental ''pratyaksha'' which is divided into ''Samanya'', ''Lakshana'', ''Gyana lakshana'' and ''Yogaja''. ''Pratyaksha''  (apparent  or obvious) is divided into ''[[Savikalpa]]'', ''[[Nirvikalpa]]'' and ''Pratibhigya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Indology|author=Vishnulok Bihari Shrivastava|publisher=Pustak Mahal|page=209|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eaCbv1NcbHwC&amp;pg=PT209&amp;dq=pratyaksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4vXFU8zQFYSGuATJ0YD4BA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=pratyaksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pratyaksha'' knowledge is intuitive in nature and in [[Yoga]] and [[Vedanta]] is also known as [[Aparokshanubhuti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology in India Vol.3|author=Girishwar Misra|publisher=Pearson Education India|page=107|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fXQzo7LGfuIC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=pratyaksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lgHGU6XVC9OMuATrn4CYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=pratyaksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{canon law}}
'''Presumption in the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]''' of the Catholic Church is a term signifying a reasonable conjecture concerning something doubtful,&lt;ref name=Manual395/&gt; drawn from arguments and appearances, which by the force of circumstances can be accepted as a proof. It is on this presumption our common adage is based: "Possession is nine points of the law". Presumption has its place in canon law only when positive proofs are wanting, and yet the formulation of some judgment is necessary. It is never in itself an absolute proof, as it only presumes that something is true. Canonists divide presumption into:
#presumption of law (''juris''), or that which is deduced from some legal precept or authority expressed in law or based upon precedents or similarities, and
#presumption of a judge or man (''judicis'' or ''hominis''), when the law is silent on the subject and an opinion must be formed according to the way that circumstances and indications would affect a prudent man or judge.

==Canon 1584==
{{main|1983 Code of Canon Law}}
Canon 1584 of the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] defines the current [[canonical jurisprudence]] around presumption:
{{quote|A presumption is a probable conjecture about an uncertain matter; one is a presumption of law, which is established by the law itself; another is human, which is formulated by a judge.&lt;ref&gt;Coriden, ''The Code of Canon Law'', canon 1584 (pg. 988).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This canon of the 1983 Code removes the distinction between relative and absolute legal presumption that was present in the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]].&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt;

==Varieties of presumption==
There are several sub-varieties of presumption of law. The foundation of these legal presumptions is to be sought in the natural conclusions drawn from the ordinary happenings of common life and the consideration of the motives that usually sway men in given circumstances. The general rules are thus formulated: "What is natural is presumed to be in the person or case in question"; "Change is not to be presumed"; "Presumption is to be formed from the favourable side". As to effects, when there is question of presumption ''juris,'' it abstracts from the necessity of proof; not so presumption ''hominis.'' A judge can follow the first in civil cases even when doubt remains, not so the second. The former places the burden of proof on the adversary, but the latter does not. Finally, the first is considered of itself equivalent to proof, while the second needs corroboration from something extraneous to itself.

==''Presumptio juris''==
A legal presumption (''presumptio juris''&lt;ref name=Manual395&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a presumption that is stated in the positive canon law (''ab ipsa lege''&lt;ref name=Coriden988&gt;Coriden, ''The Code of Canon Law'', pg. 988 (commentary on canon 1584).&lt;/ref&gt;). Under the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]],&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt; legal presumption was divided into two kinds:&lt;ref name=Manual395/&gt; ''juris tantum'' "which is relative and vincible by both direct and indirect proof to the contrary",&lt;ref name=Manual395/&gt; and ''juris et de jure'' or absolute presumption which can only be refuted by indirect proof (undermining the fact(s) upon which the presumption is based).&lt;ref name=Manual395/&gt; This distinction between the subdivisions of legal presumption, the relative (''juris simpliciter''&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt;) and the absolute&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt; (''juris et de jure'') was not continued into the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] and was dropped.&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt;

===''Juris tantum''===
Thus, it is called presumption of law alone (''juris tantum'') when a thing is judged to be so until the contrary is proved. Hence the legal formulæ: [[Presumption of innocence|"Everyone is presumed innocent until his guilt is proved"]]; "Once bad always bad" (i. e. in the same species of ill-doing, if amendment is not certain); "What is known in a remote place is known in a neighbouring place", and others similar.

===''Juris et de jure''===
It is denominated presumption ''juris et de jure,'' when the law so strongly supports the presumption that it is held to be certain in judicial proceedings. Against such a presumption no proofs are admitted except the evident truth. Thus, goods described in the inventory made by a guardian are presumed to belong to the possessions of the deceased, nor would the later testimony of the guardian himself to the contrary ordinarily be admitted.

==''Presumptio juris naturalis''==
Natural presumptions (''presumptiones juris naturales'') fall under the definition of ''presumptio hominis''. According to a generally held opinion of canonists, "presumptions ''hominis'' and ''naturae'' are, in as far as they are moral, in contrast to presumptions ''juris'' or legal presumptions."&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 396,&lt;br&gt;citing Augustine, ''A Commentary on the New Code of Canon Law, Vol. VII'' (St. Louis: 1923), pg. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presumptions of the [[natural law]] are those presumptions that are not stated in the positive canon law, and as such do not constitute ''legal'' presumptions.&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt; Some presumptions of the natural law have been incorporated into the ''[[Regulæ Juris|Rules of Law]]''.&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt; Sometimes judges use natural law presumptions as their basis for judicial presumptions.&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt;

===''Judicis'' or ''hominis''===
As to the presumption ''judicis'' or ''hominis'', it is denoted by the following:
#It is called ''vehement,'' when the probability is very strongly supported by most urgent conjectures. Thus, a birth would be held illegitimate, which took place eleven months after a husband's decease. A vehement presumption is considered equivalent to a full proof in civil causes of not too great importance. As to whether it should have sufficient effect in criminal causes to produce the condemnation of an accused person, canonists do not agree.
#It is termed ''probable,'' when it arises from less urgent and only less probable conjectures and indications. Such presumption is looked on as merely a semi-proof, unless it be sustained by public rumour, in which case it is held as sufficient proof. 
#Finally, it is denominated ''rash,'' or ''temerarious,'' if it rests on insufficient conjectures or scarcely probable arguments. Such presumption is to be entirely rejected as a proof.

==Biography==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}

'''Robert Linssen''' (11 April 1911 – 15 May 2004) was a Belgian [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] and author.  Linssen wrote in French, but many of his texts have been translated into other languages including English.  Like other Western authorities on the subject of Zen Buddhism (such as the author [[Alan Watts]]), Linssen's ideas about Buddhism in general and Zen Buddhism in particular have been influential both to practitioners of Zen and to academics.

{{nihongo|'''Sengaku-ji'''|泉岳寺}} is a [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] temple located in the [[Takanawa]] neighborhood of [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato-ku]], near [[Sengakuji Station]] and [[Shinagawa Station]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].  

== History ==
The temple became famous through the [[Akō incident]] of the forty-seven Rōnin in the 18th century. The tomb of Lord [[Asano Naganori|Asano Takumi-no-Kami Naganori]] is located here, who was forced to commit ritual suicide after he broke protocol and drew a sword in the [[Edo Castle]]. 

His retainers the [[forty-seven Rōnin]] led by Oishi Kuranosuke avenged his death, washed his opponent's head in a [[water well]] and presented it on the altar in front of his tomb. Afterwards they were ordered by the Shogun to commit ritual suicide and were also buried here next to their master. Their story became famous through the [[Kabuki]] epic [[Chūshingura]] and their graves became a popular site of pilgrimage. 

Each year on December 14, the temple holds a festival commemorating the 47 Rōnin.

The '''''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''''' ('''''SEP''''') combines an [[online encyclopedia]] of [[philosophy]] with peer-reviewed publication of original papers in philosophy, freely accessible to Internet users. It is maintained by [[Stanford University]]. Each entry is written and maintained by an expert in the field, including [[professor]]s from many academic institutions worldwide. Authors contributing to the encyclopedia give Stanford University the permission to publish the articles, but retain the [[copyright]] to those articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/info.html#c|title=''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Copyright Information|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach and history==
[[File:Wikimania 2015 - Edward Zalta.webm|thumbnail|"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Issues Faced by Academic Reference Works That May Be of Interest to Wikipedians" by Edward N. Zalta. [[Wikimania 2015]], [[Mexico City]]]]{{As of|March 2018}}, the ''SEP'' has nearly 1,600 published entries.&lt;ref name="about-the-sep"&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/about.html |website=plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from its online status, the encyclopedia uses the traditional academic approach of most encyclopedias and [[academic journal]]s to achieve quality by means of specialist authors selected by an editor or an editorial committee that is competent (although not necessarily considered specialists) in the field covered by the encyclopedia and [[peer review]].{{Original research inline|date=January 2018}}

The encyclopedia was created in 1995 by [[Edward N. Zalta]], with the explicit aim of providing a dynamic encyclopedia that is updated regularly, and so does not become dated in the manner of conventional print encyclopedias. The charter for the encyclopedia allows for rival articles on a single topic to reflect reasoned disagreements among scholars. Initially, the ''SEP'' was developed with U.S. public funding from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[National Science Foundation]]. A long-term fundraising plan to preserve [[open access]] to the encyclopedia is supported by many university libraries and library consortia.  These institutions contribute under a plan devised by the ''SEP'' in collaboration with the [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]], the [[International Coalition of Library Consortia]], and the [[Southeastern Library Network]], with matching funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2100">{{wiktionary|supernatural order}}
In [[Christian theology]], the '''Supernatural order''' is, according to [[New Advent]], defined as "the ensemble of effects exceeding the powers of the created universe and gratuitously produced by God for the purpose of raising the rational creature above its native sphere to a God-like life and destiny."&lt;ref name=NA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14336b.htm|title=Supernatural Order|last=Sollier|first=J.|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Modern Catholic Dictionary'' defines it as "[t]he sum total of heavenly destiny and all the divinely established means of reaching that destiny, which surpass the mere powers and capacities of human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=36719|title=Supernatural Order|last=Hardon|first=Fr. John|publisher=Eternal Life|accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Christian philosophy==
According to New Advent, "the philosophical possibility and the critical ascertainment of the supernatural order are the central point of Christian apologetics."&lt;ref name=NA/&gt;

==In Supernaturalism==
{{main|Supernaturalism}}
According to [[supernaturalism]], a supernatural order is the original and fundamental source of all that exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/religiondefinition/p/TheismGod.htm|title=How Religions Involve Theism|last=Cline|first=Austin|year=2008|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, it is this supernatural order which defines the limits of what may be known.

'''Susanne Katherina Langer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|ŋ|ər}}; ''née'' '''Knauth'''; December 20, 1895 – July 17, 1985) was an American philosopher, writer, and educator and was well known for her theories on the influences of art on the mind. She was one of the first women in American history to achieve an academic career in philosophy and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled, ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. In 1960, Langer was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Born Susanne Katherina Knauth, Langer was raised in Manhattan's West Side in New York. She was the daughter of Antonio Knauth, an attorney, and Else Uhlich, both emigrants of Germany. Though she was American born, Langer's primary language was German, as it was strictly spoken in her household throughout her youth, and her German accent remained her entire life. She was exposed thoroughly to creativity and art, most specifically through music. She was taught to play the cello and the piano, and she continued with the cello for the remainder of her life. As a girl, Langer enjoyed reciting the works of great poets as well as traditional children's rhymes and tales. This sparked her love for reading and writing, and she would often write her own poems and stories to entertain her younger siblings. Her love of nature began during the summers her family spent in their cottage on Lake George. She married William Leonard Langer, a fellow student at Harvard in 1921, and in the same year they took their studies to Vienna, Austria. They had two sons and moved back to Cambridge, Massachusetts before the couple divorced in 1942. She died July 17, 1985.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/16/16-02412.html|title=American National Biography Online: Langer, Susanne K.|website=www.anb.org|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/topelius.htm |title=Susanne Langer |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221075501/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/topelius.htm |archivedate=21 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Her early education included attendance at [[Veltin School for Girls]], a private school as well as being tutored from home. In 1916, Langer enrolled at Radcliffe College. She earned the bachelor's degree in 1920 and continued with graduate studies in philosophy at Harvard, where she received the master's diploma in 1924 and the doctorate in 1926. She was a tutor in philosophy at Radcliffe from 1927 to 1942. She lectured in philosophy for one year at the University of Delaware and for five years at Columbia University (1945-1950). From 1954 to 1962 she taught at Connecticut College. She also taught philosophy at the University of Michigan, New York University, Northwestern University, Ohio University, Smith College, Vassar College, the University of Washington, and Wellesley College.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Philosophy ==

Susanne Langer's unexplored thesis revolving around the connection of consciousness and aesthetics as well as her unusual use of language in her writing ultimately caused her to be scrutinized by her fellow scholars. However, it led her to further explore the complexity and nature of human consciousness.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shelley, C 1998, 'Consciousness, Symbols and Aesthetics: A Just-So Story and its Implications in Susanne Langer's 'Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling', ''Philosophical Psychology'', 11, 1, pp. 45-66, Philosopher's Index, EBSCOHost, viewed 4 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Langer's philosophy explored the continuous process of meaning-making in the human mind through the power of “seeing” one thing in terms of another. Langer's first major work is entitled, ''Philosophy in a New Key''. It put forth an idea that has become commonplace today: that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Howard Gardner, "Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer" ''Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity'', New York: Basic Books, pp. 48–54&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with a critique of positivism, the work is a study of human thought progressing from semantic theory through philosophy of music, sketching a theory for all the arts. For Langer, the human mind "is constantly carrying on a process of symbolic transformation of the experiential data that come to it," causing it to be "a veritable fountain of more or less spontaneous ideas".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Susanne Langer's distinction between discursive versus presentational symbols is one of her better known concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Michael H. G., Geist und Welt – durch die Symbolisierungen der Kunst betrachtet, a review of Susanne K. Langer, Die lebendige Form menschlichen Fühlens und Verstehens (The living form of human feeling and understanding). Munich: Fink, 2000. {{ISBN|3-7705-3462-X}}, IASL Online, retrieved 2010-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Discursive symbolization arranges elements (not necessarily words) with stable and context invariant meanings into a new meaning. Presentation symbolization operates independently of elements with fixed and stable meanings. The presentation cannot be comprehended by progressively building up an understanding of its parts in isolation. It must be understood as a whole. For example, an element used in one painting may be used to articulate an entirely different meaning in another. The same principle applies to a note in a musical arrangement—such elements independently have no fixed meaning except in the context of their entire presentation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lachmann, Rolf (January 1998), From Metaphysics to Art and Back: The Relevance of Susan K. Langer’s Philosophy for Process Metaphysics 26, Process Studies, pp. 107–125&lt;/ref&gt;

Langer believed that symbolism is the central concern of philosophy because it underlies all human knowing and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, Stephen W.; Foss, Karen A. (2008), ''Theories of Human Communication'' (9th ed.), Belmont, California: The Thomson Wadsworth Corporation, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[Ernst Cassirer]], Langer believed that what distinguishes humans from animals is the capacity for using symbols. While all animal life is dominated by feeling, human feeling is mediated by conceptions, symbols, and language. Animals respond to signs, but stimulus from a sign is significantly more complex for humans. The perspective also is associated with symbolic communication where animal societies are studied to help understand how symbolic communication affects the conduct of members of a cooperating group.

Langer is one of the earliest philosophers who paid close attention to the concept of the virtual. Inspired by Henri Bergson's notions of matter and memory, she connected art to the concept of the virtual. For her, figuring out the space of an art work by its creator was no less than building a virtual world. She describes virtuality as "the quality of all things that are created to be perceived." For her, the virtual is not only a matter of consciousness, but something external that is created intentionally and existing materially, as a space of contemplation outside of the human mind. Langer sees virtuality as a physical space created by the artist, such as a painting or a building, that is “significant in itself and not as part of the surroundings.” She particularly considers architecture not as the realization of a space for being, but its conceptual translation into virtuality for perceiving: “The architect, in fine, deals with a created space, a virtual entity.” In contrast to Bergson, for Langer, virtuality is tangible and can cause a contemplative interaction between humans and the machine.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne K. Langer, ''Feeling and Form'' (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1953), 65 and 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her later years, Langer came to believe that the decisive task of her work was to construct a science and psychology based theory of the "life of the mind" using process philosophy conventions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Langer's final work, ''Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling'' represents the culmination of her attempt to establish a philosophical and scientific underpinning of aesthetic experience, relying on a three volume survey of a comprehensive set of relevant humanistic and scientific texts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== History of feeling ===
Langer's desire to study the mind and its connections with art was rooted in her theory that works of art are representations of human feeling and expression. This led Langer to construct a biological theory of feeling that explains that "feeling" is an inherently biological concept that can be connected to evolutionary genetics. In her essay, ''Mind'', Langer goes into depth to connect the early evolution of man to how we perceive the mind today. She explains that early organisms underwent refinery through natural selection, in which certain behaviors and functions were shaped in order for them to survive. Langer describes the body's organs to all operate within a specific rhythm, and these rhythms must cooperate with one another to keep the organism alive. This development, Langer explains, was the beginning of the framework for the Central Nervous System, which Langer believed to be the heart of cognitive interactions among humans.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Rhetoric ===
Susanne Langer's work with symbolism and meaning has led to her association with contemporary rhetoric, although her influence in the field is somewhat debated.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Lunsford, Andrea (1995). Reclaiming Rhetoric: Women in the Rhetorical Tradition. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press. pp. 265–284.&lt;/ref&gt; Langer established the use of symbols as the "epistemic unit of community",&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; suggesting that all knowledge in a community is gained and built from shared symbol-systems within a given culture. Langer's concept regarding language and dialogue may be understood to imply that language does not simply communicate, but it produces symbols from which humans then create their own reality.&lt;ref&gt;Innes, Robert (2008). Susanne Langer in Focus: The Symbolic Mind. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Claimed support of this perspective comes from Langer's statement that "language is intrinsic to thinking, imagining, even our ways of perceiving".&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;

According to Arabella Lyon, professor at State University of New York, Langer holds that meaning arises from the relationship between a community, its discourse, and the individual.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Lyon suggests that Langer's work may be viewed as a contradiction to the comparatively traditional theories of Aristotle, by way of Langer's argument that discourse forms through sensory experiences shared between speaker and hearer, rather than through logic as advocated by the philosopher. Langer's epistemic view of symbolism and language, which further examines the motivation of the speaker, the influential aspects of language that affect people, and the relationship between the speaker and the community,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; are often reflected in aspects of modern rhetorical studies.

== Influences ==
[[File:Susanne Langer - Filosofia é a contínua busca de sentidos - mais amplos, claros, negociados, articulados.svg|thumb|Poster with a quotation of Susanne Langer in Portuguese]]
Langer's works were largely influenced by fellow philosophers Ernst Cassirer and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. Whitehead, an English mathematician and philosophy professor, was Langer's professor at Radcliffe. Whitehead introduced Langer to the history of human thought, the origins of the modern world, and contemporary philosophy. He helped shape her perspective on these topics which she presented in her first text, The Practice of Philosophy. Throughout her career, Whitehead continued to influence her understanding of the complicated world of human thought which guided her to pursue a philosophical career.  She shared Whitehead’s belief in going beyond the limitations of scientific research and believed that along with the new-found thinking and ideas that had initiated the modern era in science and philosophy, the opportunity for a rebirth of philosophical creativity would arise. Langer dedicated Philosophy in a New Key, to "Alfred North Whitehead, my great Teacher and Friend."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/drydenlangerwhitehead.htm|title=Dryden, "Whitehead’s Influence on Susanne Langer’s Conception of Living Form"|website=www.anthonyflood.com|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susanne Langer's other main influence was the German philosopher Ernst Cassirer. Cassirer was a neo-Kantianist who studied the field of theories of symbolization. Cassirer influenced much of Langer's ides in ''Philosophy in a New Key'', where she stated that the creation of symbols is the essential activity of art, myth, rite, the sciences, mathematics, and philosophy. She stated, "It is a peculiar fact that every major advance in thinking, every epoch-making new insight, springs from a new type of symbolic transformation". She drew from Cassirer's view in her belief that art theory must be independent with a theory of mind.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Susanne Langer is not an extremely well known philosopher; however, her work has influenced and continues to influence many. As one of the first female philosophers, her work has posed as an inspiration to many fellow women to pursue a future in philosophy and other related fields. Her imaginative views on the connections of art and aesthetics with the human mind were revolutionary during her time and sparked a wide interest in the complexity of human consciousness. Although her work is not often cited by today's philosophers, her theories on presentational symbolic activity are part of the "[[collective unconscious]]" where philosophy and psychology meet anthropology.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Book reviews===

[[Nicholas Kristof]] reviewed the book for ''[[The New York Times]]'', beginning with a discussion of the [[earning to give]] strategy. Kristof had three reservations about the book: (1) it's not clear where to draw the line with respect to altruism, (2) in addition to humanitarian motives, loyalty is also important and many give to universities or the arts out of loyalty, (3) the idea of taking a job solely because it is well-paying made him flinch. Kristof concluded on a positive note: "Singer’s argument is powerful, provocative and, I think, basically right. The world would be a better place if we were as tough-minded in how we donate money as in how we make it."&lt;ref name=kristof&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-the-trader-who-donates-half-his-pay.html|title = The Trader Who Donates Half His Pay|last = Kristof|first = Nicholas|authorlink = Nicholas Kristof|date = April 4, 2015|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/416476/nicholas-kristof-shouldnt-follow-peter-singer-wesley-j-smith|title = Nicholas Kristof Shouldn’t Follow Peter Singer|last = Smith|first = Wesley|date = April 5, 2015|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = ''The Corner'', ''[[National Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Chicago Law School]] professor [[Eric Posner]] reviewed the book for ''[[Slate Magazine]]'', concluding: "So what’s an effective altruist to do? The utilitarian imperative to search out and help the people with the highest marginal utility of money around the world is in conflict with our limited knowledge about foreign cultures, which makes it difficult for us to figure out what the worst-off people really need.* For this reason, donations to Little League and other local institutions you are familiar with may not be a bad idea.

Minal Bopaiah wrote a blog post favorably reviewing the book for PSI Impact, a website maintained by [[Population Services International]]. PSI was one of many charities discussed by Singer in his book as potentially effective places to donate to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psiimpact.com/2015/04/book-review-the-most-good-you-can-do-by-peter-singer/|title = Book Review: The Most Good You Can Do by Peter Singer |last = Bopaiah|first = Minal|date = April 8, 2015|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = PSI Impact}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Abdulla reviewed the book on [[Oxfam]]'s blog, concluding: "And so the question that remains for me, as I think more about the ideas laid out in this book, is how can I challenge myself to do more good in this world?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstperson.oxfamamerica.org/2015/04/want-to-do-the-most-good-you-can-do-in-the-world-follow-these-3-steps/|title = Want to do the most good you can do in the world?

Glenn C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6104">{{Nihongo|'''Tominaga Nakamoto'''|富永 仲基|Tominaga Nakamoto|1715–1746}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katō|first=Shūichi|title=Tominaga Nakamoto, 1715-1746: A Japanese Iconoclast|journal=Monumenta Nipponica|year=1967|volume=22|issue=1/2|pages=177–193|jstor=2383230|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/t2xrznwdbldbimj/1967-shuichi.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[Kaitokudō]] academy founded by members of the mercantile class of Osaka, but was ostracised shortly after the age of 15. Tominaga belonged to a Japanese rationalist school of thought and advocated a Japanese variation of atheism, ''mukishinron'' (no gods or demons). He was also a [[merchant]] in [[Osaka]]. Only a few of his works survive; his ''Setsuhei'' ("Discussions on Error") has been lost and may have been the reason for his separation from the Kaitokudō, and around nine other works' titles are known.&lt;ref name="corpus"&gt;Kato 1967, pg183&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving works are his ''Okina no Fumi'' ("The Writings of an Old Man"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwern.net/docs/tominaga/okinanofumi.pdf "The Writings of an Old Man"], translator Kato Shuichi, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shutsujō Kōgo'' ("Words after Enlightenment"; on textual criticism of Buddhist sutras), and three other works on ancient musical scales, ancient measurements, and poetry.

He took a deep [[Critical theory|critical]] stance against normative systems of thought, partially based on the Kaitokudō's emphasis on objectivity, but was clearly heterodox in eschewing the dominant philosophies of the institution. He was critical of [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Shintoism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tetsuo Najita]], ''Visions of Virtue'', ChicagoL UOC Press, [http://www.gwern.net/docs/tominaga/1987-najita-visionsofvirtue-excerpts.pdf pp102-106].&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas each of these traditions drew on history as a source of authority, Tominaga saw appeals to history as a pseudo-justification for innovations that try to outdo other sects vying for power. For example, he cited the various Confucian Masters who saw human nature as partially good, neither good nor bad, all good, and inherently bad; analysing later interpreters who tried to incorporate and reconcile all Masters. He criticised Shintoism as [[obscurantist]], especially in its habit of secret instruction. As he always said, "hiding is the beginning of lying and stealing".&lt;ref&gt;Hajime Nakamura, [https://books.google.es/books?id=sePiBcehtYcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487&amp;dq=%22Nakamoto+Tominaga+%22+lying&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FUqMZ2GIKi&amp;sig=LZuz47oXF9DTp7HpN8eGzzVDgJ0&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=neDkTq_iKsnDhAeP7-zZAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA# Ways of Thinking of Eastern People: India, China, Tibet, Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ketelaar|first=James Edward|title=Of Heretics and Martyrs in Meiji Japan: Buddhism and Its Persecution|year=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02481-3|pages=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dy0Wp6OpIPkC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of [[Buddhist scripture]]s, he asserted that [[Hinayana]] school of scriptures preceded [[Mahayana]] scriptures but also asserted that the vast majority of Hinayana scriptures are also composed much later than the life of [[Gautama Buddha]], the position which was later supported by modern scriptural studies. His work represents an early and indigenous example of [[Buddhist studies]] and reflects awareness of [[Manichaeism]] and its possible relationship with Buddhism.&lt;ref name="relinjapan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephson |first=Jason |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=7-8|location = Chicago|year=2012|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo13657764.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Michael Pye has argued that Tominaga represents a non-European example of [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pye |first=Michael |title=Modern Japan and the Science of Religions |url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/tominaga/2003-pye.pdf |journal=Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–27 |publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; this view has been challenged by Jason Josephson, who argues that Tominaga does not treat non-Buddhist traditions as systematic religions. &lt;ref name="relinjapan" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Chinese language]] [[neologism]] for women who have [[Marriage|married]] [[gay]] men.  Liu Dalin, among the first [[sexologist]]s in Mainland China, estimates that 90% of gay Chinese men marry a heterosexual woman,&lt;ref name="economist 18 march"&gt;{{cite news

Gay Chinese men are under [[social pressure]] to marry and produce a male [[heir]] to continue the family line, as [[Confucianism]] places a strong emphasis on this.&lt;ref name="economist 18 march" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The word combines the {{linktext|同}} ''tong'' from [[Tongzhi (term)|tongzhi]] (slang for "gay") with {{linktext|妻}} ''qi'' ("wife").&lt;ref name="economist 18 march" /&gt;

==Life as Tongqi==
Very few of the women who enter into these marriages are aware that their spouses are gay.&lt;ref name = "Huff Post"/&gt; Many women have turned to [[social media]] because it allows them to maintain anonymity while expressing their feelings about being married to gay men.  The majority of these women worry more about the social stigma of being divorced in Chinese society than they do about being in a loveless marriage. For the men, the shame of being stigmatized as homosexual causes them to enter these marriages in the first place.&lt;ref name = "Shenzhen"/&gt; In addition to the emotional toll of being married to a man who does not desire them physically, nearly 90% of these women suffer physical abuse and "sexual apathy" from their husbands.&lt;ref name = "China Daily"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huiying|first1=Zhou|title=Survey: Women who marry gay men suffer abuse|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-04/18/content_20464623.htm|website=China Daily|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many women who are married to gay men in China are dependent on the men for financial survival.

The '''Whitehead Research Project''' (WRP) is dedicated to the research of, and scholarship on, the texts, philosophy, and life of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. It explores and analyzes the relevance of Whitehead's thought in dialogue with contemporary philosophies in order to unfold his [[philosophy of organism]] and its consequences for our time and in relation to emerging philosophical thought. Of particular interest is the investigation into the emergence of Whitehead's philosophy in the context of British and American pragmatism, its complicated relation to [[Continental philosophy]] and the analytic tradition, the relevance of his thought in the discourse of post-modern paradigms of [[deconstruction]] and [[post-structuralism]], and its creative impulse for developing process philosophies. Additionally, following Whitehead's own inclination to reach beyond European modes of thought, WRP seeks to extend its horizon of research by fostering similar conversations with strains of Indian and East Asian thought, thereby exhibiting de facto mutual influence–e.g., with the [[Kyoto School]] of Buddhist philosophy.

==History==
The WRP was conceived and founded in 2005 by [[Roland Faber]], who serves as its executive director. In February 2005, Faber proposed and installed WRP as a project of the [[Center for Process Studies]], a faculty research center of the [[Claremont School of Theology]] since 1973 and of which Faber is the executive director. In March 2005, the goal of creating a fully integrated online Whitehead research interface was established as a long-term, strategic aim of WRP. The official inauguration of WRP followed in December 2005 with its first international conference, "Event and Decision", on Badiou, Deleuze, and Whitehead. In March 2006, Faber invited [[Brian G. Henning]] to serve as the WRP's Director of Research. In July 2006, the creation of the WRP's International Board of Academic Advisors signaled the completion of the first phase of the genesis of WRP.

In July 2009, the WRP announced the creation of the [[Whitehead Research Interface]], also known as EVE (in honor of Whitehead's beloved wife, Evelyn). Once implemented, EVE will revolutionize the study of Whitehead's works by providing open access to the most complete electronic library of Whiteheadian scholarship in the world, some parts of which have never been made available to scholars.

In 2009, WRP founded [[Contemporary Whitehead Studies]] (CWS), an interdisciplinary book series that publishes manuscripts from scholars with contemporary and innovative approaches to Whitehead studies. By publishing innovative and adventurous approaches to Whitehead’s philosophy that engage with the problems, promise, and ideas of the twenty-first century, Contemporary Whitehead Studies creates a vital and dynamic space for scholarly engagement.

In September 2010, the WRP announced the inauguration of the Critical Edition of Whitehead, a long-term initiative of the WRP that will, for the first time, make available the complete published and unpublished writings of Alfred North Whitehead in a single, critical edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whiteheadresearch.org/occasions/news/2010-09-11-Inauguration_of_CEW.shtml |title=Whitehead Research Project: News: Inauguration of the Critical Edition of Whitehead |website=Whiteheadresearch.org |date=2010-09-11 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Critical Edition of Whitehead is led by General Editor George R. Lucas, Jr. and Executive Editor Brian G. Henning.

[[File:Ardha-Navāsana.JPG|thumb|A [[woman]] practising [[navasana]] on a '''Yoga mat''']]
'''Yoga mats''' are specially fabricated mats used as an aid during the practice of [[hatha yoga]] to prevent hands and feet slipping during [[asana]] practice. They are also commonly known as '''non-slip mats''', '''non-skid mats''' or '''sticky mats'''.

== History ==
Ancient yoga practice in India was originally conducted on [[Desmostachya bipinnata|kusha]] grass, on hard earth without any cover, or on a rug of [[deer]] or [[tiger]] skin. Due to the scarcity and cost of such rugs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Swenson| year=1999 | title=Ashtanga Yoga - The Practice Manual }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are now rarely used even in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simply-yoga.co.uk/Yoga+mat+info/?the-history-of-the-yoga-mat,4|title=The History of the Yoga Mat|publisher=Uncle Mats Yoga Mat Emporium|accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With yoga's introduction in the West, many practitioners used towels or [[cotton]] mats on wooden floors. [[Rubber]] mats were introduced as an intermediate material to prevent cotton mats from slipping on wooden floors. Slipping of hands and feet was avoided by squirting a mist of water on the mats on the respective places of positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Mira | last=Mehta | year=1994 | title=How to use Yoga }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, while teaching yoga in [[Germany]], Angela Farmer used carpet underlay cut to towel size during yoga classes; later she returned home to [[London]] with the material.

The first purpose-made yoga mat was manufactured and sold by [[Hugger Mugger Yoga Products]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yoga-Supply House Fit for a Market; Utah-built company reflects strength of founder's vision |author=Janet Rae Brooks |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=5 November 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the first ‘eco-conscious’ mat was manufactured by EcoYoga and sold through Yogamatters in Britain.

Yoga mats increasingly fulfill the purpose of reducing risk of injury and some insurance companies require yoga practice to be executed with a non-slip mat in order to be eligible for coverage.

==Types==
===Dimensions===
''Yoga mat''s are normally around 72" / 182&amp;nbsp;cm long and have a width of 24" / 60&amp;nbsp;cm. Some practitioners prefer extra-wide mats (30" / 78&amp;nbsp;cm) for positions such as [[Surya Namaskar]] or hand-balances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prana.com/blog/index.php/tag/revolution-natural-sticky-mat|title=Revolution Natural Sticky Mat|publisher=prAna Blog|accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yoga mat''s range in thicknesses from 2&amp;nbsp;mm (lightweight) to 4–5&amp;nbsp;mm (standard or "classic") and up to 7&amp;nbsp;mm for either high performance mats reserved for professional daily practices while guaranteeing little wear-out, or soft mats providing extra cushioning during yoga therapy.

===Aesthetics===
Yoga mats are available in many colors and patterns. "Alignment mats" are printed with guides to proper alignment. Some companies print custom images on mats. Other items used to complement yoga mats are belts, blocks and bricks,

== Material ==
The first commercially produced yoga mats were made from [[PVC]]. More recently, commercial mats have become made from natural [[jute]] and rubber. Mats with rubber bases may have microfiber top layers.

'''Yuval Steinitz''' ({{lang-he|יובל שטייניץ}}; born 10 April 1958) is [[Israel]]'s [[Ministry of National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources|Minister of Energy]], in charge of [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]] and a member of the [[Security Cabinet of Israel|Security Cabinet]]. He is a member of the [[Knesset]] from the [[Likud]] party. He served as [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|Minister of Finance]] (2009-2013) and as [[Intelligence and Atomic Energy Minister of Israel|Minister of Intelligence]] and [[Strategic Affairs Minister of Israel|Strategic Affairs]] (2013-2015). Steinitz holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D. in Philosophy]] and was a senior lecturer at the [[University of Haifa]].

==Life and career==
Born and raised in [[Moshav]] [[Ramot HaShavim]], 30&amp;nbsp; km north of [[Tel Aviv]], he is the eldest of four children. His father, Dan, is an engineer and his late mother, Mina, was a teacher of literature and philosophy. Steinitz served in the IDF as a soldier in [[Golani Brigade|Golani infantry Brigade]] (1977-1980). He sustained a leg injury during a battle with the Syrian army when he served as a reservist, during the [[1982 Lebanon War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/151414/bibis-man-on-iran A Loyal Ally to Netanyahu Moves to Center Stage as Iranian Talks Heat Up]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic work===
After three years of compulsory military service, he was awarded BA and MA in Philosophy at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] with honors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=695 MK Yuval Steinitz in the Knesset website]&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral thesis ''From a Rational Point of View'' was completed at the Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas at [[Tel Aviv University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities1.tau.ac.il/cohn/index.php/about/2010-10-20-20-36-18 Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas] Tel Aviv University website {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis examined the possibility of logical arguments for the existence of God, and the rule of logical reasoning in modern science. In 1993 Steinitz was awarded the [[Alon Scholarship]], the most prestigious award for outstanding young doctors in Israel, which led to a teaching position at the [[University of Haifa]]. Steinitz was chosen two years in a row as "The outstanding Lecturer" in philosophy and the philosophy of science. In 1996 he was appointed Senior Lecturer (the Israeli parallel of a [[Academic tenure|tenured assistant professor]]).
 
Steinitz has published several philosophy books. The first, ''Invitation to Philosophy'' (1987), became a number one best-selling philosophy book in Israeli history, and was printed in 60 editions. Another book, ''A Logical-Scientific Missile to God and Back'' became a best seller as well and was printed in 17 editions. He also published  philosophical papers in academic journals including ''[[The Philosophical Quarterly]]'', ''[[American Philosophical Quarterly]]'', ''[[International Philosophical Quarterly]]'', ''[[Religious Studies (journal)|Cambridge Religious Studies]]'', and ''[[Iyyun|The Jerusalem Philosophical Quarterly Iyyun]]''.

===Political career===
Steinitz's political involvement began in the early 1980s when he joined the '[[Peace Now]]' movement as a young student. He was injured in his leg (the same leg again) during an anti-government rally in [[Jerusalem]] in 1983, when a right-wing extremist hurled a hand-grenade into the crowd, killing peace activist [[Emil Grunzweig]].&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1142735.html 'With all guns blazing'] Haaretz&lt;/ref&gt;
His reservations about [[Oslo Accords]] signed with the [[Palestinians]], together with his concerns regarding the massive [[Egyptian Army|Egyptian military]] buildup despite the peace treaty with Israel, led him to shift to the right in 1995 and to publicly support the [[Likud]] Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the7eye.org.il/21392 Avi Pozen "Beaad atzuma hogenet"] The Seventh Eye, 1 May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 15th Knesset (1999–2003)===
In [[Israeli legislative election, 1999|1999]] he was elected to the 15th Knesset on the [[Likud]] list. A year later he became a member of the [[Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee]] and the chairman of its "Subcommittee on Defense Planning and Policy" and a member of the Constitution and Law Committee.

In 1999-2004 he served as president of Israel's Media Watch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imediaw.org.il/?page_id=196 Israel's Media Watch past Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 16th Knesset (2003–2006)===
After being reelected to the [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|16th Knesset]], he became chairman of [[Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee]], chairman of the "Subcommittee on Intelligence and Secret Service" and co-chairman of the "Joint Committee on Defense with the US Congress", which he established and chaired together with Senator [[Jon Kyl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3366186,00.html "American senators to visit Israel"] YnetNews, 17 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Right at the beginning of his tenure, Steinitz declared that the committee will cease to be "The House of Lords" and will exercise "a very proactive and effective [[parliament]]ary oversight of Israel defense establishment". This new approach has led him to a series of clashes with [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]], with [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Minister of Defense]] [[Shaul Mofaz]] and with [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|IDF Chief of Staff]] [[Moshe Ya'alon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=814876 "Who oversees the military?"] ''Globes'', 17 July 2004 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later he established the "Investigation Committee for the Israeli Intelligence following the Iraq War" and appointed himself as its chairman. This was followed later on by the establishment of similar committees in [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The committee report in 2004 sharply criticized the [[Israeli Intelligence Community]] for misleading alerting reports, following its failure to detect the non-existence of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles in Iraq before the war. Additionally, the report also criticized the failure of the Israeli intelligence to detect the [[Libya and weapons of mass destruction|Libyan nuclear program]] on time. The committee's public report included a number of specific recommendations:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/committees/eng/docs/intelligence_complete.pdf The Committee of Enquiry into the Intelligence System in Light of the War in Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consider removing [[Unit 8200|SIGINT Unit 8200]] from the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]'s and transform it into a civilian [[SIGINT]] authority.
* Accelerate the development of the Israeli [[Reconnaissance satellite|spy satellites]] program, operated together by the IDF and the [[Mossad]].
* Providing a special program of advanced academic studies for young intelligence officers, that will include, among other areas, some philosophical background. This recommendation was implemented with the establishment of the BA and MA "[[Havatzalot Program]]".
* Appointing a special intelligence secretary to the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] with the same status as the [[Military Secretary to the Prime Minister|military secretary]].

Alongside with the above, Steinitz established a special Public Committee led by Prof. [[Amnon Rubinstein]] to examine the means to improve [[parliament]]ary oversight of the defense establishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.walla.co.il/item/639611 recommendation: The Knesset will oversee the territories] Walla News, 13 December 2004 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; As committee chairman often pointed to the massive [[Egyptian military]] buildup with modern American weapons. In addition, Steinitz expressed a great Support for developing the [[Israeli Navy]] into a significant strategic arm and published several articles on this issue at the [[Maarachot|Maarachot Military Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://maarachot.idf.il/PDF/FILES/8/110348.pdf The sea as Israeli strategic depth] Maarachot, May 2002 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]], Steinitz did support [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]]'s [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|2005 plan to withdrawal from Gaza]]. Yet, at the same time, he led a [[parliament]]ary battle against delivering the [[Philadelphi Route|Philadelphi Corridor]] to [[Egypt]], claiming that the Egyptians deliberately ignore [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] arms smuggling through the [[Sinai Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101202032937/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/QAHeb.jhtml?qaNo=132 Q&amp;A with MK Yuval Steinitz] Haaretz, 2 December 2010 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that the Israel-Egypt [[Philadelphi Accord|Philadelphi agreement]] might erode the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|demilitarization of Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3134261,00.html Government confirms: Changes to the peace agreement with Egypt] Yedioth Ahronoth, 28 August 2005 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he called for a rapid "[[Operation Defensive Shield|Defensive Shield]]" Operation in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], prior to the Israeli withdrawal, in order to destroy the [[Hamas]] and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] rockets industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3090249,00.html Steinitz: Military operation or postpone disengagement from Gaza] Ynet, 25 May 2005 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the Israeli censorship allowed the publication of the secret documents that Steinitz sent to Prime Minister Sharon and the heads of the security services and intelligence organizations - in which he indicated in the summer of 2004 the possible existence of a secret nuclear project in Syria. It turned out that Steinitz and the sub-committee he chaired were the first in Israel and in the entire Western world, who have uncovered the military nuclear project in Syria, in absolute contrast to the intelligence agencies in Israel and the world. In the summer of 2004, Steinitz asked the Mossad and the Israeli Military Intelligence Directorate to present to the sub-committee of Intelligence and Secret Services a special plan to uncovering the likely secret nuclear project in Syria. While the military intelligence ignored the warnings, the Mossad did, in fact, change its action plan according to Steinitz's report, and after three years the Mossad found proof of the existence of a nuclear plant in the process of being built in the Syrian desert, what led to the [[Operation Outside the Box|distruction of the plant by the Israeli Air Force]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/mks-warned-of-syrias-nuke-plans-years-before-reactor-strike-report/ MKs warned about Syria’s nuke plans years before 2007 reactor strike – report] Times of Israel, 6 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 17th Knesset (2006–2009)===
Steinitz was reelected to the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|17th Knesset]] in 2006 when the [[Likud]] has lost his leading position to [[Kadima]]. As an opposition [[Knesset|MK]] became again a member on the [[Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee]] and as the chairman of the "Subcommittee on Defense Readiness". Steinitz was [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]]'s candidate for chairman of the "[[World Likud]]" in June 2006, but he lost to MK [[Danny Danon]].

===The 18th Knesset (2009–2013)===
After being reelected to the 18th Knesset, and following the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|Likud 2009 victory]], Steinitz was appointed [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|Minister of Finance]] and a member of the inner [[Security Cabinet of Israel|Security Cabinet]] by Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1075341.html Netanyahu sworn in as Israel's prime minister] Haaretz, 1 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first Finance Minister of Israel to submit to the Knesset a two-year budget, instead of the until-then customary one-year budget. This move generated some controversy, with some accusing it of decreasing government transparency&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000555470&amp;fid=980 Two-year budget feeds corruption] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005084121/http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000555470&amp;fid=980 |date=5 October 2012 }}. Globes (27 April 2010). Retrieved on 9 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and others praising it for its greater efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frischoffthepress.com/index.php/component/content/article/69-3rd-and-long/238-a-case-study-in-success-yuval-steinitz A Case Study in Success: Yuval Steinitz] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816190157/http://frischoffthepress.com/index.php/component/content/article/69-3rd-and-long/238-a-case-study-in-success-yuval-steinitz |date=16 August 2011 }}. Frischoffthepress.com (5 October 2010). Retrieved on 9 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Israel continued with the biennial budget and became the first country in the west to institute such a policy change. In 2009, most experts in the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance opposed Steinitz's move, but today the biennial budget had a wide approval among the officials in the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance.

===The 19th Knesset (2013–2015)===
In the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|19th Knesset]] Steinitz served as [[Intelligence and Atomic Energy Minister of Israel|Minister for Intelligence]], [[Strategic Affairs Minister of Israel|Strategic Affairs]] and International Relations in the [[Thirty-third government of Israel|new government]].

===The 20th Knesset (2015–)===
Steinitz was reelected to [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|20th Knesset]] and became [[Ministry of National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources|Minister of National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Resources]] in the [[Thirty-fourth government of Israel]].

===Legislation===
Among the laws initiated by Steinitz during his tenure as MK:
* A law of three-year cooling off period for [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] generals and Heads of the [[Mossad]], [[Shin Bet]], and the [[Israel police|Police]], before they can become [[Knesset|Knesset Members]] or [[Cabinet of Israel|government ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3375598,00.html Knesset approves 3-year cooling off period for IDF officers] YnetNews, 12 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* A law regulating the research of biological pathogens (bacteria, viruses, etc.) (with MK [[Aryeh Eldad]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/new-law-regulates-research-of-dangerous-bacteria-and-viruses-1.256766 New Law Regulates Research of Dangerous Bacteria and Viruses] Haaretz, 6 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* A law requiring noise meters in event halls.

==Minister of Finance (2009-2013)==
With the establishment of the 32nd by [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]], Steinitz was appointed [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|Minister of Finance]]. He took up this position in March 2009, during the beginning of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global economic crisis]], and after the [[Economy of Israel|Israeli economy]] already suffered from two quarters of negative [[economic growth]] which led to almost 10% [[unemployment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financeisrael.mof.gov.il/FinanceIsrael/docs/en/TheIsraeliLaborMarket_1999-2014.pdf The Israeli Labor Market 1999-2014] Chief Economist Department's, Ministry of Finance&lt;/ref&gt;

After few weeks at office, Steinitz has launched an emergency plan entitled "Blima &amp; Tnufa" (Break and Accelerate) aimed at returning the [[Israel|country]] to positive [[economic growth]], through dramatically encouraging investments in the [[Science and technology in Israel|high-tech industry]], in [[Research and development|R&amp;D]], and in construction and [[Transport in Israel|transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mof.gov.il/budgetsite/economicplan/documents/program%20dealing%20with%20the%20economic%20crisis%20in%202010-2009.pdf "Blima &amp; Tnufa"] Ministry of Finance {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the program, a "triple package deal" between the government, the [[Histadrut]] Unions Association and the [[Manufacturers Association of Israel|Israel Manufacturers Association]] was signed. The employees agreed to contribute 3.5 Billion NIS to help accelerating [[economic growth|growth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/890/163.html "After a night of discussions the package deal is signed"] NRG, 13 May 2009 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, Steinitz announced his unprecedented plan to enact the first biennial budget in Israel's history,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/me02392.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his counter-crisis policy. In July 2009, the government approved the biennial budget (since then all budgets in Israel were biennial).

At the beginning of his term, Steinitz raised the VAT from 15.5% to 16.5% effectively from July 2009, but it was reduced to 16% in January 2010. In 2010 the [[Economy of Israel|Israeli economy]] has already shown the fastest growing figures in the [[western world]], with 5% growth and sharp reduction of [[unemployment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/analysts-shocked-officials-gleeful-at-surging-israeli-growth-7-8-in-q4-1.343864 Analysts shocked, officials gleeful at surging Israeli growth: 7.8% in Q4] Haaretz, 17 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009 Steinitz appointed Prof. [[Omer Moav]] as head of his advisory committee. When Moav resigned a year later, Steinitz appointed Prof. [[Avi Simchon]] to the post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000555416 Finance Minister advisor Prof. Moav quits] Globes, 27 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009 Steinitz appointed [[Haim Shani]] as [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|director general]], but he resigned a year and a half later following the [[2011 Israeli social justice protests|2011 social protests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/treasury-chief-haim-shani-quits-over-short-shrift-from-steinitz-1.376273 Treasury Chief Haim Shani Quits Over Short Shrift From Steinitz] Haaretz, 1 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:שטייניץ עם מזכ"ל ה-OECD אנחל גורייה, ינואר 2016.jpg|200px|thumb|Secretary-General of the OECD José Ángel Gurría with Steinitz in Jerusalem, January 2016]]

In 2009 Steinitz started an intensive diplomatic campaign to promote Israel's acceptance to the [[OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Business/Business-News/PM-celebrates-Israels-OECD-accession&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, after more than thirty years of failing attempts and despite strong opposition from the [[Arab World]], Israel has finally become a full member of the [[OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8672304.stm OECD members vote unanimously to invite Israel to join] BBC News, 10 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Steinitz established the Sheshinski Committee to examine ways to increase the level of taxation on [[Natural Gas]] and [[Oil field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financeisrael.mof.gov.il/FinanceIsrael/Docs/En/publications/02_Full_Report_Nonincluding_Appendixes.pdf Sheshinski Committee Report January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Steinitz announced that he intended to raise the level of the over-whole "government-take" on [[Petroleum industry|gas and oil]] from 20% to around 50%-60%. This led to a very aggressive campaign against him by the energy lobby, including pressures from the [[US]] [[White House]] on behalf of the American [[Noble Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the7eye.org.il/12665 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Steinitz legislate the committee recommendations in the [[Knesset]], raising the "government-take" on big [[Natural gas field|gas fields]] to more than 60%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4017386,00.html The government approved raising the tax on gas] Ynet, 23 January 2011 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Steinitz has doubled the royalties paid by "[[Israel Chemicals]]" from using the [[Dead Sea]] [[natural resource]]s and cancel its historic tax exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calcalist.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3437481,00.html ICL will be entitled to special taxation track] Calcalist, 30 November 2010 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other important committees were the "Concentration Committee" (established at winter 2011 together with PM [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]]), which led to unprecedented steps to reduce [[Market concentration|economic concentration]] in Israel, like enforcing separation between significant Financial and Real holdings;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/1.565986 Q&amp;A What Is Israel's New Business Concentration Law and Why Should We Care? read more: http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/1.565986] Haaretz, 29 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; And the "Investment Taxation Committee" (established in 2010 together with Minister [[Binyamin Ben-Eliezer|Ben-Eliezer]]), which led to significant increase in Israel's investments incentives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/199735 Ministers of Industry and Finance will examine tax incentives] Channel 7, 26 January 2010 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a doctors' strike broke out and paralyzed all Hospitals and Clinics around the country, in what became the longest strike in Israel history. The strike ended after five months with a compromise between the [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|Ministry of Finance]] and the [[Israel Medical Association|Doctors union]], which included the improvement of the doctors employment conditions, especially in peripheral [[hospital]]s, as well as Steinitz's demand that hospital doctors will be subjected to time clocks. Nevertheless, hundreds of [[Internship (medicine)|interns]] and 200 senior doctors continued the strike and the protest against the deal, until eventually the protest petered out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israeli-doctors-strike-finally-ends-after-five-months-as-landmark-deal-inked-1.380681 Israeli Doctors Strike Finally Ends After Five Months as Landmark Deal Inked] Haaretz, 25 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2011, and alongside with the doctors strike, a series of social protests against the cost of living in Israel took place. Demonstrations took place for a prolonged period of time, focusing on the high housing prices and the cost of daycare. The protesters were accompanied by [[Doctor of Medicine|doctors]], [[teacher]]s, [[student]]s, and dairy farmers, who called for a change in the government social outlook.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/04/israel-protests-social-justice Israeli protests: 430,000 take to streets to demand social justice] The Guardian, 4 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning Steinitz rejected the protesters' claims. But with the continuation of the protests, Steinitz began to show a more flexible attitude. One step was lowering taxes in order to reduce [[Gasoline and diesel usage and pricing|petrol price]] hike. Following the appointment of the "[[Trajtenberg Committee]]", Steinitz dealt with implementation of the committee's recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Steinitz-praises-Trajtenberg-Ctee-not-all-recommendations Steinitz praises Trajtenberg C'tee, not all recommendations] The Jerusalem Post, 28 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[Standard &amp; Poor's|S&amp;P]] raised [[Israel]] [[credit rating]] to A+.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-09-21/israel-punches-above-weight-as-gdp-outperforms-developed-world Israel Punches Above Weight as GDP Beats Developed World] Bloomberg, 22 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This decision took place in light of the fact that Israel managed to continue to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio, and despite the global economic crisis.

During his tenure, Steinitz made extensive efforts to develop business connections with [[China–Israel relations|China]] and [[India–Israel relations|India]]. In 2010-2011, Israeli exports to these countries increased by 35%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boi.org.il/he/NewsAndPublications/RegularPublications/DocLib3/BankIsraelAnnualReport/%D7%93%D7%95%D7%97%20%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%A7%20%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%202013/all-2013.pdf Annual Report 2013] Bank Of Israel, March 2013 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his three official visits in [[China]] and [[India]], Steinitz led negotiations for the signing a series of bilateral agreements designed to increase the volume of trade with these countries. Among other things, the agreement include specipic steps to encourage young doctors from [[China]] and [[India]] to make their [[Postdoctoral researcher|Postdoctoral Researches]] in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrg.co.il/online/16/ART2/219/148.html Israel and India are establishing a high-tech investments fund totaling 40 Million Dollar] NRG, 7 March 2011 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.walla.co.il/item/1892697 For the first time in a decade : Indian foreign minister visits Israel] Walla News, 10 January 2012 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/Dovrut/pedagogia/haskala/shitufpeulaakademi.htm Academic cooperation with India and China] Education Ministry Spokesman, 27 February 2012 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Steinitz led the signing of an [[Economic partnership agreement|economic agreement]] between [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] with [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Prime Minister]] [[Salam Fayyad]]. As part of the deal, it was decided to increase joint enforcement against smuggling of goods, and [[Israel]]i assistance to the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian]] tax collection capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4263166,00.html Israel, PA ink first economic deal since 2002] Ynet News, 1 August 2012 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the state [[Government budget balance|annual deficit]] reached 39 Billion NIS, almost twice as much as was predicted, but the [[Debt-to-GDP ratio]] continued to decline. The average [[economic growth]] during Steinitz's tenure as [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|Finance Minister]] (2010-2012) was 4.5%, the highest economic growth in the entire developed world.

==Minister of Intelligence and Strategic Affairs (2013-2015)==
After the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 elections]] Steinitz was appointed [[Intelligence and Atomic Energy Minister of Israel|Minister for Intelligence]], [[Strategic Affairs Minister of Israel|Strategic Affairs]] and International Relations, and became responsible to several topics:
[[File:Israeli International Relations, Intelligence and Strategic Affairs Minister (13717279683).jpg|200px|thumb|British Foreign Secretary William Hague with Steinitz in London, April 2014]]
* '''[[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran Nuclear Program]]''' - Steinitz coordinated the [[Israel]]i [[Foreign relations of Israel|diplomatic efforts]] vis-à-vis the [[P5+1]] and the rest of the international community. He met regularly with senior officials dealing with [[Iran]]ian issue including [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]], the Chief US nuclear negotiator with Iran [[William Joseph Burns|Bill Burns]] and [[Wendy Sherman]], and the Foreign Ministers of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], and [[Germany]]. He also met the heads of intelligence in those countries, like the heads of the [[CIA]] and [[Director of National Intelligence|DNI]] in the [[US]] or the [[MI6]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. During those meetings, Steinitz emphasized the size of the threat to Israel and the whole world as a result of [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's military nuclear program]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtinews.vn/en/news/017004/32199/israel-minister-meets-british-official-on-iran-deal-.html Israel minister meets British official on Iran deal] dtinews, 27 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/world/middleeast/israeli-officials-talk-with-french-to-try-to-influence-iran-nuclear-deal.html Israeli Officials Talk With French to Try to Influence Iran Nuclear Deal] The New York Times, 23 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim Agreement he convinced the [[France|French]] delegation to insist on limiting Iranian [[Enriched uranium|Uranium enrichment]] to 3.5% level. This limitation was included in the final agreement as well. According to Steinitz, the Israeli involvement and input did have a significant impact on both the interim and [[Iran nuclear deal framework|final agreements]] with Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/193128 Intelligence Min. Wraps Up Lobbying Mission against Iran Deal] Channel 7, 24 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Responsibility for economic issues vis-à-vis [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]]''' - with the resumption of negotiations with the PA, Steinitz was appointed to coordinate the [[Economy of the State of Palestine|economic issues]].
* '''Responsibility for civilian intelligence agencies, [[Mossad]] and [[Shin Bet]]'''. 
* '''Responsibility for the [[Israel–United States relations|US-Israel]] strategic dialogue''' - as part of the activity, Steinitz led the discussions with US officials on the cooperation on policy, military, and intelligence issues, in order to strengthen the strategic alliance between the two countries.
* '''Responsibility for the [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]]'''

==Minister of Energy and Water Resources (2015-)==
In [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|May 2015]], Steinitz was appointed [[Ministry of National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources|Minister of National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Resources]], as well as Minister in charge of the [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]].
Two months later, after several years of delays and against very strong opposition from the Israeli left circles, Steinitz formulated the "Gas Framework", in order to enable the development of Israel's biggest gas discovery "[[Leviathan gas field|Leviathan]]" (discovered in 2010),  and to pave the way to future [[Hydrocarbon exploration|gas and oil explorations]]. The "Gas Framework" was approved by the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli government]] in August 2015, and by the [[Knesset]] Plenum in September 2015. Yet in March 2016 [[Supreme Court (Israel)|Israel's Supreme court]] nullified the framework stability section, and forced Minister Steinitz to amend it and bring it back to government approval. The revised framework was approved in May 2016, and the development of "[[Leviathan gas field|Leviathan]]" ultimately started.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.720888 Israeli Government Approves Revised Gas Deal] Haaretz, 22 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizportal.co.il/gazandoil/news/article/429873 Ministry of Infrastructures approved 'Leviathan' development plan] Bizportal, 2 June 2016 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:בעת ביקורו של מזכיר האנרגיה האמריקאי בישראל, אפריל 2016.jpg|thumb|right|220px|US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Steinitz in Jerusalem, April 2016]]
In April 2016 the [[United States Secretary of Energy|US Energy Secretary]] Dr. [[Ernest Moniz]] visited [[Israel]] for the first time. Together with Steinitz, they signed a bilateral agreement which upgrades the energy cooperation between the [[United States]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Environment/US-and-Israel-to-expand-energy-water-ties-amid-gas-deal-shakeup-450227 US and Israel to expand energy, water ties amid gas deal shakeup] The Jerusalem Post, 4 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016 Steinitz announced that the [[Ministry of National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources|Ministry of Energy]] will publish new [[oil and gas]] licenses, after four years in which the country economic waters were practically closed for new [[Hydrocarbon exploration|explorations and searches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-energy-minister-israel-has-gas-reserves-worth-4-leviathans-1001132526 Israel has undiscovered gas worth 4 Leviathans] Globes, 16 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2017, the natural gas monopoly consisting of the Israeli company "Delek" and the American company "Noble Energy" had begun to fall apart, when the selling of the Karish-Tanin to the Greek company "Energean" occurred. This ultimately led to more competition for customers and the cheaper prices.

In April 2017 Steinitz hosted the ministers of energy from Italy, Greece, and Cyprus, as well as the European Commissioner for Energy, to kick off his plan to construct a sub-sea pipeline - the longest and deepest in the world - allowing Israel and Cyprus to export gas to Greece and Italy, and through them to west Europe.

In his capacity, Steinitz initiated a plan to eliminating the use of coal and polluting fuels in the State of Israel, and replacing them with natural gas and renewable energies. Within 3 years the percentage of coal and mazut dropped from 65% of electricity production in 2015 to 25% in 2018. According to the plan, in 2027 Israel will no longer continue to use coal. Steinitz has also promoted a plan to shift all transportation in Israel from traditional fuels to electricity and natural gas, by the year 2030.

In June 2018, Steinitz signed an implementation agreement with his American counterpart, Rick Perry, establishing a joint energy research and development center. This cooperation agreement aims to accelerate development and rapid deployment of critical and innovative technologies for natural gas, cybersecurity, energy-water nexus, water storage, and other areas of energy that are needed to diversify energy supply and promote higher efficiency.

In 2008, when Israel refused permission for Palestinian [[Fulbright]] students to leave [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and study in the United States, Steinitz supported this action. He told the [[New York Times]]: "We are fighting the regime in Gaza that does its utmost to kill our citizens and destroy our schools and our colleges. So I don’t think we should allow students from Gaza to go anywhere. Gaza is under siege, and rightly so, and it is up to the Gazans to change the regime or its behavior."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/world/middleeast/30gaza.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ei=5087&amp;em&amp;en=2c197bd9044256e9&amp;ex=1212292800 U.S. Withdraws Fulbright Grants to Gaza].

In June 2013, when Austria planned to withdraw its UN-Troops (stationary since 1974) from the [[Golan Heights]], Yuval Steinitz issued a statement expressing regret at the Austrian move, adding that the lesson for Israel was clear: "Even as part of peace agreements, Israel cannot place its security in the hands of international forces instead of relying on the presence of IDF soldiers."{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

On 19 November 2017, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said that Israel has had covert contacts with Saudi Arabia amid common concerns over Iran. This is the first public admission of cooperation between the two countries by a senior Israeli official.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theindependent.in/meet-the-new-friend-of-israel-saudi-arabia/|title=Meet the new friend of Israel: Saudi Arabia|date=20 November 2017|website=theindependent.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 May 2018, Steinitz, in an interview to Israeli news site [[Ynet]], said that Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]], should be '[[Assassination|eliminated]]' by Israel for his relationship with Iran, he later clarified it was his personal opinion and not that of the [[Government of Israel|government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-will-eliminate-assad-if-he-lets-iran-operate-from-syria-1.6062375|title=Israel Will 'Eliminate' Assad if He Continues to Let Iran Operate From Syria, Minister Warns|last=Haaretz|date=2018-05-07|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
