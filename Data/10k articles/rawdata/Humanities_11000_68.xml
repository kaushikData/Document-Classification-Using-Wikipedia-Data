'''Amlaq Qatih''' or '''Amlaq el Qatih''' is a [[Heavy Neolithic]] archaeological site of the [[Qaraoun culture]] that is located  {{convert|2.5|km|mi}} northwest of [[Baaloul]], {{convert|5|km|mi}} north of [[Qaraoun]], [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=A.M.T.|title=The Neolithic of the Levant|publisher=Oxford University, Unpublished Ph.D. Thesis|year=1978|pages=444–446|url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/185.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.

The site was discovered and collections made  by [[Henri Fleisch]] and [[Maurice Tallon]] in 1955. Materials recovered were found to be of a cream-coloured, cherty type of flint and were suggested to date from [[Acheulian]], [[Heavy Neolithic]] and normal [[Neolithic]] periods and included a few [[Levallois technique|Levallois]] cores.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;

'''''An Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation''''' ({{lang-de|Versuch einer Critik&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kritik'' in [[modern German]].&lt;/ref&gt; aller Offenbarung}}; 1792) was the first published work by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]. It was briefly mistaken by the public to be a fourth Critique by [[Immanuel Kant]], and thereby gained Fichte much philosophical fame.

In this work, Fichte argued that any [[revelation]] in relation to [[God]] must be consistent with [[morality]], which was against many aspects of orthodox [[Christian]] belief at the time.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/fichtejg.htm Johann Gottlieb Fichte [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asian Latin Americans''' are [[Latin Americans]] of [[East Asia]]n, [[Southeast Asia]]n or [[South Asia]]n descent. West Asians are typically considered to be White. Asian Latin Americans have a centuries-long history in the region, starting with [[Overseas Filipino|Filipino]]s in the 16th century. The peak of Asian immigration occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, however. There are currently more than four million Asian Latin Americans, nearly 1% of [[Latin America]]'s population. [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] are the group's largest ancestries; other major ones include [[Overseas Filipino|Filipinos]], [[Koreans]], and [[Indian people|Indians]]. [[Brazil]] is home to the largest population of Asian Latin Americans, at some 2.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/trabalhoerendimento/pnad2006/brasilpnad2006.pdf|format=PDF|title=Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios 2006|trans-title=National Sample Household Survey 2006|language=pt|publisher=Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|date=2007|volume=47|accessdate=10 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611203345/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/trabalhoerendimento/pnad2006/brasilpnad2006.pdf|archivedate=11 June 2008|postscript=: See Table 1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080115i1.html=search.japantimes.co.jp Japan, Brazil mark a century of settlement, family ties | The Japan Times Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The highest ratio of any country in the region is 5%,&lt;ref name="ocac.gov.tw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocac.gov.tw/english/public/public.asp?selno%3D1163%26no%3D1163%26level%3DB |title=The Ranking of Ethnic Chinese Population |publisher=Overseas Community Affairs Council, Republic of China (Taiwan) |accessdate=26 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123193905/http://www.ocac.gov.tw/english/public/public.asp?selno=1163&amp;no=1163&amp;level=B |archivedate=23 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Peru]]. There has been notable emigration from these communities in recent decades, so that there are now hundreds of thousands of people of Asian Latin American origin in both [[Japan]] and the [[United States]].

==History==
The first Asian Latin Americans were [[Overseas Filipino|Filipino]]s who made their way to Latin America (primarily [[Filipino Cubans|to Cuba]] and [[Mexico]], and secondarily to [[Colombia]], [[Panama]] and [[Peru]]) in the 16th century, as sailors, crews, prisoners, slaves, adventurers and soldiers during the [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|Spanish colonial period of the Philippines]]. For two and a half centuries (between 1565 and 1815) many Filipinos sailed on the [[Manila Galleon|Manila-Acapulco Galleons]], assisting in the [[Spanish Empire]]'s monopoly in trade. Some of these sailors never returned to the [[Philippines]], and many of their descendants can be found in small communities around [[Baja California]], [[Sonora]], [[Mexico City]], [[Lima, Peru|Peru]] and others, thus making Filipinos the oldest Asian ethnic group in Latin-America.

While South Asians had been present in various forms in Latin America for centuries by the 1800s, it was in this century that the flow into the region spiked dramatically. This rapid influx of hundreds of thousands of mainly male South Asians was due to the need for indentured servants. This is largely tied to the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/caribbeanhistory/slavery-negotiating-freedom.htm abolition of black slavery in the Caribbean colonies in 1834]. Without the promise of free labor, and a hostile working class on their hands, the Dutch colonial authorities had to find a solution – cheap Asian labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Modern Latin America|last=Meade|first=Teresa|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=978-1-118-77248-5|location=West Sussex, UK|pages=141-142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many of these immigrant populations became such fixtures in their adopted countries that they acquired names of their own. For example, the Chinese men who labored in agricultural work became known as “[[Coolie|Coolies]]”. While these imported Asian laborers were initially just replacement for agricultural slave labor, they gradually began to enter other sectors as the economy evolved. Before long, they had entered more urban work and the service sector. In certain areas, these populations assimilated into the minority populations, adding yet another definition to go on a [[casta]].  

In some areas, these new populations caused conflict. In northern Mexico, tensions became inevitable when the United States began to [[Chinese Exclusion Act#The "Driving Out" period|shut off Chinese immigration]] in the early 1880s. Many who were originally bound for the USA were re-routed to Mexico. The rapid increase in population and rise to middle/upper class standing generated strong resentment among existing residents. These tensions lead to riots. In the state of Sonora, the entire Chinese population was expelled in 1929. 

Today, the overwhelming majority of Asian Latin Americans are of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]], or [[Korean diaspora|Korean]] descent. Japanese migration mostly came to a halt after World War II (with the exception of [[Japanese settlement in the Dominican Republic]]), while Korean migration mostly came to an end by the 1980s and Chinese migration remains ongoing in a number of countries.

Settlement of war refugees has been extremely minor: a few dozen ex-North Korean soldiers went to Argentina and Chile after the [[Korean War]],&lt;ref name="Bialogorski"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bialogorski|first=Mirta|chapter=La comunidad coreana - Argentina - Logros de una inmigración reciente|pages=275–296|title=Cuando Oriente llegó a América: Contribuciones de inmigrantes chinos, japoneses, y coreanos|publisher=Banco Interamericano De Desarrollo|year=2005|isbn=978-1-931003-73-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Park|first=Chae-soon|chapter=La emigración coreana en América Latina y sus perspectivas|title=Segundo Congreso del Consejo de Estudios Latinoamericanos de Asia y de Oceania|publisher=Latin American Studies Association of Korea|publication-place=Seoul|year=2007|url=http://www.lasak.or.kr/CELAOfiles/papers/Session3/Park%20Chae%20Soon%5BSession3-2%5D.pdf|accessdate=2008-09-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722141305/http://www.lasak.or.kr/CELAOfiles/papers/Session3/Park%20Chae%20Soon%5BSession3-2%5D.pdf|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some Hmong went to [[French Guiana]] after the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3498056.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hmong's new lives in Caribbean | date=2004-03-10 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roles in Labor ==
Asian Latin Americans served various roles during their time as low wage workers in Latin America. In the second half of the nineteenth century, nearly a quarter of a million Chinese migrants in Cuba worked primarily on sugar plantations. The Chinese "coolies" who migrated to Peru took up work on the Andean Railroad or the Guano Fields. Over time the Chinese progressed to acquiring work in urban centers as tradesmen, restaurateurs, and in the service industry. By the second decade of the nineteenth century, approximately 25,000 Chinese migrants in Mexico found relative success with small businesses, government bureaucracy, and intellectual circles. In the 1830's the British and Dutch colonial governments also imported South Asians to work as indentured servants to places such as Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname,Curaçao, and British Guiana (later renamed Guayana). At the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Japanese immigrants reached Brazil and Peru. Much like the Chinese, the Japanese often worked as indentured servants and low wage workers for planters. Japanese work contracts were notably more short term than those of the Chinese and the process was closely monitored by the Japanese government to dissuade abuse and foul play. In both cases, the influx of Asian migrant workers was to fill the void left in the Latin American work forces after the abolition of slavery. Employers of all kinds were desperate for a low cost replacement for their slaves so those who did not participate in any illegal slave operations turned to the Asian migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present|last=Meade|first=Teresa|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons. Inc.|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Geographic distribution==
Four and a half million Latin Americans (almost 1% of the total population of Latin America) are of Asian descent. The number may be millions higher, even more so if all who have partial ancestry are included. For example, Asian Peruvians are estimated at 5%&lt;ref name="ocac.gov.tw"/&gt; of the population there, but one source places the number of all Peruvians with at least ''some'' [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] ancestry at 5&amp;nbsp;million, which equates to 20% of the country's total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taste-of-peru.com/peruvian_culture/chinese.php |title=Peruvian Culinary Culture: Chinese Influence |publisher=Taste of Peru |date= |accessdate=13 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927041027/http://taste-of-peru.com/peruvian_culture/chinese.php |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most who are of Japanese descent reside in Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Bolivia, and Paraguay while significant populations of Chinese ancestry are found in [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Argentina]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Panama]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Mexico]], and [[Costa Rica]] (where they make up about 1% of the total population). [[Nicaragua]] is home to 12,000 ethnic Chinese; the majority reside in [[Managua]] and on the [[Caribbean]] coast. Smaller communities of Chinese, numbering just in the hundreds or thousands, are also found in [[Ecuador]] and various other Latin American countries. Most Korean communities are in [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]], [[Guatemala]], [[Paraguay]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]]. There are around 12,918 living in Guatemala. There is also a [[Hmong people|Hmong]] community in Argentina. [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Panama]], and [[Venezuela]] also have [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Asian Indian]] communities.

Japanese Peruvians have a considerable economic position in Peru.&lt;ref name="PJ"&gt;Lama, Abraham. Asian Times. Home is where the heartbreak is. 1999.  September 6, 2006.&lt;http://www.atimes.com/japan-econ/AJ16Dh01.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Many past and present Peruvian Cabinet members are ethnic Asians, but most particularly Japanese Peruvians have made up large portions of Peru's cabinet members and former president [[Alberto Fujimori]] is of Japanese ancestry who is currently the only Asian Latin American to have ever served as the head of any Latin American nation. [[Brazil]] is home to the largest [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]] community outside [[Japan]], numbering about 1.7 million with ancestry alone. Brazil is also home to 10,000 Indians, 5,000 Vietnamese, 4,500 Afghans, 2,900 Indonesians and 1,000 Filipinos.

==Emigrant communities==

===Canada===
Canada has been a destination for Asian Latin American emigration. The immigrants usually settle in the largest cities, such as [[Vancouver]] and [[Toronto]] and integrate into the overall [[Asian Canadians|Asian Canadian]] communities.

===Japan===
{{Main|Dekasegi}}
[[Brazilians in Japan|Japanese Brazilian immigrants to Japan]] numbered 250,000 in 2004, constituting Japan's second-largest immigrant population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=6996 |title=Japanese Brazilian Return Migration and the Making of Japan's Newest Immigrant Minority |accessdate=2008-03-21 |author=Richard Gunde |date=2004-01-27 |publisher=UCLA International Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204213520/http://www.international.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=6996 |archivedate=4 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiences bear similarities to those of Japanese Peruvian immigrants, who are often relegated to low income jobs typically occupied by foreigners.&lt;ref name="PJ"/&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans}}
Most Asian Latin Americans who have migrated to the [[United States]] live in the largest cities, often in [[Asian American]] or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino]] communities in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], [[New York metropolitan area]], [[Chicago metropolitan area]], [[San Francisco Bay area]], [[Greater Houston]], the [[San Diego County, California|San Diego area]], [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]], [[California]], [[Dallas-Fort Worth]] and [[South Florida]] (mainly [[Chinese Cubans]]). They and their descendants are sometimes known as Asian Hispanics and Asian Latinos.

In the [[United States Census 2000|2000 US Census]], 119,829 Hispanic or Latino [[Demographics of the United States|Americans]] identified as being of Asian race alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/cenbr01-1.pdf |format=PDF|title=Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2000 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the Census Bureau's [[American Community Survey]] estimated them at 154,694,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2006_EST_G2000_B03002&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-currentselections=PEP_2006_EST_G2006_T004_2006&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en|title=B03002.

In the United States, there are Facebook groups that are devoted to Asian Hispanics in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/5363933778/ |title= LatinAsians in New York |accessdate=2010-09-01 |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/16723867462/ |title= LatinAsians in CA |accessdate=2010-09-01 |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bay Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/105918219450966/ |title= LatinAsians in Bay Area |accessdate=2010-09-01 |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atet''' ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:ꜥḏt|ꜥḏt]]}}) was the [[Solar deity#Solar barge and sun chariot|solar barge]] of the [[Solar deity|sun god]] [[Ra]] in the [[Egyptian mythology|mythology]] of the [[ancient Egypt]]ians. It was also known as the '''Mandjet''' ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:mꜥnḏt|mꜥnḏt]]}}), the '''Boat of Millions of Years''' ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:wjꜣ-n-ḥḥw|wjꜣ-n-ḥḥw]]}}), and, during the night, as the '''Mesektet''' ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:msktt|msktt]]}}).

Ra&amp;nbsp;— variously conflated with other solar gods such as [[Amun]] and [[Hathor]]&amp;nbsp;— was said to travel through the sky on the barge, providing light to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.touregypt.net/godsofegypt/sunboat.htm |contribution=The Sun Boat |title=The Gods of Ancient Egypt |publisher=Tour Egypt |accessdate=7 March 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Each twelfth of his journey formed one of the twelve [[Egyptian hours]] of the day, each overseen by a protective deity. Ra then rode the Atet through the [[Egyptian underworld|underworld]], with each hour of the night considered a gate overseen by twelve more protective deities. Passing through all of these while fending off various destructive monsters, Ra reappeared each day on the eastern horizon.

The progress of Ra upon the Atet was sometimes conceived as his daily growth, decline, death, and resurrection and it appears in the symbology of Egyptian mortuary texts.

== In other media ==

Ra's ship appears in the 2016 film [[Gods of Egypt (film)|Gods of Egypt]]. In the film, the ship appears as a seafaring ship that drags the Sun across the sky.

'''Bokerley Dyke''' (or '''Bokerley Ditch''') is a [[Romano-British]] defensive dyke {{convert|3.25|mi|km|1}} long in north east [[Dorset]], [[England]], near the villages of [[Woodyates]] and [[Pentridge]].  

Bokerley Dyke may have originated in the [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]] or [[British Iron Age|Early Iron Age]] and formed a political and cultural boundary.&lt;ref name="pastscape"&gt;[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=906268 Bokerley Dyke] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930231906/http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=906268 |date=September 30, 2012 }}, Pastscape&lt;/ref&gt; It was cut through by a Roman Road ([[Ackling Dyke]] running between [[Old Sarum]] and [[Badbury Rings]]) in the 1st century.&lt;ref name="pastscape"/&gt;

In the 4th century it was remodelled and bought back into use, and excavations show that the Roman road was blocked.&lt;ref name="pastscape"/&gt;&lt;ref name="putnam"&gt;Bill Putnam, (2000), ''Discover Dorset: The Romans'', page 71. The Dovecote Press&lt;/ref&gt; A coin of [[Valens]] dates this activity to shortly after 364 AD.&lt;ref name="pastscape"/&gt; It may have been built in 367-8 AD when Roman sources report that Britain was attacked by Picts, Scots and Saxons in a supposed [[Great Conspiracy]].&lt;ref name="putnam"/&gt; The Roman road was later reopened, but the dyke may have continued in use after the cessation of the Roman rule and still forms part of a boundary between the counties of [[Dorset]] and [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="pastscape"/&gt;

Bokerley Dyke is continuous with [[Grim's Ditch]] which runs into Hampshire.

'''''Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosophy: Fear and Trembling in Sunnydale''''' is an academic publication relating to the fictional [[Buffyverse]] established by two TV series, [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'']] and [[Angel (1999 TV series)|''Angel'']].

==Book description==

Despite creator Joss Whedon's professed atheism, ''Buffy'' often dealt with religious and philosophical symbolism. The book is made up of a collection of essays that link classical philosophy to the ''Buffy'' show's ability to explore the underlying evil in everyday life through supernatural metaphor.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

American writer [[C. J. Cherryh]]{{`s}} career began with publication of her first books in 1976, ''[[Gate of Ivrel]]'' and ''[[Brothers of Earth]]''. She has been a prolific [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] author since then, publishing over 80 novels,  short-story compilations, with continuing production as her [[blog]] attests.&lt;ref name="che-progress"&gt;{{cite web | author=Cherryh, C.

The article is divided into North, Central, and South America sections; however, the classifications do not always neatly correspond to these continent divisions.

==North America==

===Gallatin (1836)===

An early attempt at North American language classification was attempted by [[Albert Gallatin|A. A. Albert Gallatin]] published in 1826, 1836, and 1848. Gallatin's classifications are missing several languages which are later recorded in the classifications by [[Daniel Garrison Brinton|Daniel G. Brinton]] and [[John Wesley Powell]]. (Gallatin supported the assimilation of indigenous peoples to Euro-American culture.)

===Powell's (1892) "Fifty-eight"===
[[John Wesley Powell]], an explorer who served as director of the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], published a classification of 58 "[[Language family#Subdivision|stocks]]" that is the "cornerstone" of genetic classifications in North America. Powell's classification was influenced by Gallatin to a large extent.

John Wesley Powell was in a race with [[Daniel G. Brinton]] to publish the first comprehensive classification of North America languages (although Brinton's classification also covered South and Central America). As a result of this competition, Brinton was not allowed access to the linguistic data collected by Powell's fieldworkers.

===Sapir (1929): Encyclopædia Britannica===
Below is [[Edward Sapir]]'s (1929) famous ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' classification. Note that Sapir's classification was controversial at the time and it additionally was an original proposal (unusual for general encyclopedias). Sapir was part of a "[[lumper (taxonomy)|lumper]]" movement in Native American language classification. Sapir himself writes of his classification: "A more far-reaching scheme than Powell's [1891 classification], suggestive but not demonstrable in all its features at the present time" (Sapir 1929: 139). Sapir's classifies all the languages in North America into only 6 families: Eskimo–Aleut, Algonkin–Wakashan, Nadene, Penutian, Hokan–Siouan, and Aztec–Tanoan. Sapir's classification (or something derivative) is still commonly used in general languages-of-the-world type surveys. (Note that the question marks that appear in Sapir's list below are present in the original article.)

===Voegelin &amp; Voegelin (1965): The "Consensus" of 1964===
[[Image:Early Localization Native Americans USA.jpg|thumb|300px]]

The Voegelin &amp; Voegelin (1965) classification was the result of a conference of Americanist linguists held at Indiana University in 1964. This classification identifies 16 main genetic units.

Chumashan, Comecrudan, and Coahuiltecan included in Hokan with "reservations". Esselen is included in Hokan with "strong reservations". Tsimshian and Zuni are included in Penutian with reservations.

===Campbell &amp; Mithun (1979): The "Black Book"===
Campbell &amp; Mithun's 1979 is a more conservative classification where they insist on more rigorous demonstration of genetic relationship before grouping. Thus, many of the speculative phyla of previous authors are "split".

===Kaufman (1990)===

====Families and isolates====

Terrence Kaufman's classification is meant to be a rather conservative genetic grouping of the languages of South America (and a few in Central America). He has 118 ''genetic units''. Kaufman believes for these 118 units "that there is little likelihood that any of the groups recognized here will be broken apart". Kaufman uses more specific terminology than only ''language family'', such as ''language area'', ''emergent area'', and ''language complex'', where he recognizes issues such as partial [[mutual intelligibility]] and [[dialect continuum]]s. The list below collapses these into simply ''families''. Kaufman's list is numbered and grouped by "geolinguistic region". The list below is presented in alphabetic order. Kaufman uses an anglicized orthography for his genetic units, which is mostly used only by himself. His spellings have been retained below.

====Stocks====
In addition to his conservative list, Kaufman list several larger "stocks" which he evaluates. The names of the stocks are often obvious hyphenations of two members; for instance, the Páes-Barbakóa stock consists of the Páesan and Barbakóan families. If the composition is not obvious, it is indicated parenthetically. Kaufman puts question marks by Kechumara and Mosetén-Chon stocks.

====Clusters &amp; networks====
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Kaufman's largest groupings are what he terms ''clusters'' and ''networks''. Clusters are equivalent to macro-families (or phyla or superfamilies). Networks are composed of clusters. Kaufman views all of these larger groupings to be hypothetical and his list is to be used as a means to identify which hypotheses most need testing.

==All of the Americas==

===Swadesh (1960 or earlier)===
Morris Swadesh further consolidated on Sapir's North American classification and expanded it to group all [[indigenous languages of the Americas]] in just 6 families, 5 of which were entirely based in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Mauricio Swadesh| title = Tras la huella lingüística de la prehistoria| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IYQkVkdsKXgC&amp;pg=PA114| year = 1987| publisher = UNAM| isbn = 978-968-36-0368-5| page = 114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Vasco-Dene languages]] included the Eskimo–Aleut, Na-Dene, Wakashan and Kutenai families along with most of the languages of Eurasia.
# Macro-Hokan roughly comprised a combination of Sapir's Hokan–Siouan and Almosan families and expanded into Central America including the [[Jicaque language]].
# Macro-Mayan comprising Mayan along with Sapir's Penutian and Aztec-Tanoan families, the [[Otomanguean languages]] and various languages of Central and South America including the [[Chibchan languages]], the [[Paezan languages]] and the [[Tucanoan languages]].
# Macro-Quechua comprising the [[Zuni language]], the [[Purépecha language]] and various languages of South America including [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the [[Aymara language]], the [[Panoan languages]] and most of the various other languages of Patagonia and the Andes.
# Macro-Carib, an almost entirely South American family including the [[Carib languages]], the [[Macro-Je languages]] and the [[Jirajara languages]], albeit including some Caribbean languages.
# Macro-Arawak, a family primarily confined to South America and its component families included the [[Arawakan languages]] and the [[Tupian languages]]. However, it also was proposed to include the [[Taíno language]] in the Caribbean and the [[Timucua language]] in Florida.

===Greenberg (1960, 1987)===
[[Joseph Greenberg]]'s classification&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=rdbEBricFRUC&lt;/ref&gt; in his 1987 book ''[[Joseph Greenberg#The languages of the Americas|Language in the Americas]]'' is best known for the highly controversial assertion that all North, Central and South American language families other than [[Eskimo–Aleut]] and [[Na-Dene]] including Haida, are part of an [[Amerind peoples|Amerind]] [[macrofamily]].  This assertion of only three major American language macrofamiles is supported by DNA evidence,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/science/earliest-americans-arrived-in-3-waves-not-1-dna-study-finds.html&lt;/ref&gt; although the DNA evidence does not provide support for the details of his classification.

[[Image:Mesa Verde National Park Cliff Palace Right Part 2006 09 12.jpg|thumb|right|Cliff Palace in 2006]]
[[Image:mesaverde cliffpalace 20030914.752.jpg|thumb|Cliff Palace in 2003]]

'''Cliff Palace''' is the largest [[cliff dwelling]] in North America. The structure built by the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] is located in [[Mesa Verde National Park]] in their former homeland region. The cliff dwelling and park are in the southwestern corner of [[Colorado]], in the Southwestern United States.

==History==
[[Dendrochronology|Tree-ring dating]] indicates that construction and refurbishing of Cliff Palace was continuous approximately from 1190 [[Common Era|CE]] through 1260 CE, although the major portion of the building was done within a 20-year time span. The Ancestral Pueblo that constructed this cliff dwelling and the others like it at Mesa Verde were driven to these defensible positions by "increasing competition amidst changing climatic conditions".&lt;ref name="Native North America 2010, p. 128"&gt;Archaeology of Native North America, 2010, Dean R. Snow, Prentice-Hall, New York. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Cliff Palace was abandoned by 1300, and while debate remains as to the causes of this, some believe that a series of [[megadrought]]s interrupting food production systems is the main cause. Cliff Palace was rediscovered in 1888 by [[Richard Wetherill]] and Charlie Mason while out looking for stray cattle.&lt;ref name="turney"&gt;Turney, Chris (2008). Ice, Mud &amp; Blood: Lessons of Climates Past.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/meve/historyculture/people.htm People], NPS.gov, Accessed November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/meve/historyculture/cd_cliff_palace.htm Cliff Palace], NPS.gov, Accessed March 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Cliff Palace was constructed primarily out of sandstone, mortar and wooden beams. The sandstone was shaped using harder stones, and a mortar of soil, water and ash was used to hold everything together. "Chinking" stones were placed within the mortar to fill gaps and provide stability. Many of the walls were decorated with colored earthen plasters, which were the first to erode over time.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}
Many visitors wonder about the relatively small size of the doorways at Cliff Palace; the explanation being that at the time the average man was under {{convert|5|ft|6|in}}, while the average woman was closer to {{convert|5|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/meve/historyculture/cd_cliff_palace.htm Cliff Palace], NPS.gov, Accessed August 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cliff Palace contains 23 [[kiva]]s (round sunken rooms of ceremonial importance) and 150 rooms and had a population of approximately 100 people. One kiva, in the center of the ruin, is at a point where the entire structure is partitioned by a series of walls with no doorways or other access portals. The walls of this kiva were plastered with one color on one side and a different color on the opposing side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/meve/historyculture/cd_cliff_palace.htm Cliff Palace], NPS.gov, Accessed November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; "It is thought that Cliff Palace was a social, administrative site with high ceremonial usage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/meve/historyculture/cd_cliff_palace.htm Cliff Palace], NPS.gov, Accessed March 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] believe that Cliff Palace contained more clans than the surrounding Mesa Verde communities. This belief stems from the higher ratio of rooms to kivas. Cliff Palace has a room-to-kiva ratio of 9 to 1. The average room-to-kiva ratio for a Mesa Verde community is 12 to 1.&lt;ref name="Native North America 2010, p. 128"/&gt;
This ratio of kivas to rooms may suggest that Cliff Palace might have been the center of a large polity that included surrounding small communities.&lt;ref name="Native North America 2010, p. 128"/&gt;

===Square Tower===
A large square tower is to the right and almost reaches the cave "roof".  It was in ruins by the 1800s.  The National Park Service carefully restored it to its approximate height and stature, making it one of the most memorable buildings in Cliff Palace.  It is the tallest structure at Mesa Verde standing at {{convert|26|ft}} tall, with four levels. Slightly differently colored materials were used to show that it was a restoration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/meve/historyculture/preservation.htm Preservation], NPS.gov, Accessed November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.cyark.org/mesa-verde-info#square-tower-house Square Tower House Description], CyArk.org, Accessed March 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2288">In [[linguistics]], a '''cognate object''' (or '''cognate accusative''') is a [[verb]]'s [[object (grammar)|object]] that is etymologically related to the verb. More specifically, the verb is one that is ordinarily [[intransitive]] (lacking any object), and the cognate object is simply the verb's [[noun]] form. For example, in the sentence ''He slept a troubled sleep'', ''sleep'' is the cognate object of the verb ''slept''. 

==Examples==
In English, the construction can occur with a number of intransitive verbs, which then become transitive:
*''He slept a troubled sleep.'' (He slept, and his sleep was troubled.)
*''He laughed a bitter laugh.'' (He laughed bitterly.)
*''He dreamed a strange dream.'' (He dreamed, and his dream was strange.)
(That seems to be the only example that has a more natural-sounding equivalent that would be used in everyday conversation: ''"He had a strange dream."'')
*''He walked their walk and talked their talk.'' (He walked and talked as they did.)
*''He smiled a charming smile.'' (He smiled, and his smile was charming.)
*''He danced a cheerful dance.'' (He danced, and his dance was cheerful.)
*''He died a painful death.'' (He died painfully.)

In some of these cases, the cognate object allows for a simpler construction. In others, it may be chosen for [[idiom]]atic or [[rhetoric]]al reasons. In general, the cognate object's modifiers are in some sense modifying the verb: for example, ''He slept a troubled sleep'' tells how he slept. Semantically, many of these verbs denote modes of nonverbal expression (laugh, smile) and bodily actions or motions (dance, walk, sleep), specifically including what Levin calls "waltz verbs," those that are [[conversion (word formation)#Verbification|zero-related]] (identical) to the names of dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A '''corpus manager''' ('''corpus browser''' or '''corpus query system''') is a tool for multilingual [[Corpus linguistics|corpus]] analysis, which allows effective searching in corpora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.korpus.cz/doku.php/pojmy:korpusovy_manazer |title=Korpusový manažer

 |publisher=Český národní korpus |access-date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A corpus manager usually represents a complex tool that allows one to perform searches for language forms or sequences. It may provide information about the context or allow the user to search by positional attributes, such as [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]], [[Part-of-speech tagging|tag]], etc. These are called [[Concordance (publishing)|concordances]]. Other features include the ability to search for [[Collocation]]s, frequency statistics as well as metadata information about the processed text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kouklakis|first1=George|last2=Mikros|first2=George|last3=Markopoulos|first3=George|last4=Koutsis|first4=Ilias|title=Corpus Manager A Tool for Multilingual Corpus Analysis|journal=Proceedings from Corpus Linguistics Conference|date=2007|pages=1–12|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/documents/college-artslaw/corpus/conference-archives/2007/244Paper.pdf|publisher=University of Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The narrower meaning of corpus manager refers only to the server side or the corpus query engine, whereas the client side is simply called the user interface.

A corpus manager can be software installed on a personal computer or it might be provided as a web service.

In The [[United States]] [[criminal justice system]], a '''Courtroom Workgroup''' is an informal arrangement between a criminal [[prosecutor]], [[criminal defense attorney]], and the [[judicial officer]]. This foundational concept in the academic discipline of [[criminal justice]] recharacterizes the seemingly adversarial courtroom participants as collaborators in "doing justice." The courtroom workgroup was proposed by Eisenstein and Jacob in 1977 to explain their observations of the ways courts, especially lower level courts, actually come to decisions.

Because the courtroom workgroup deviates from the public consensus of how justice works, it has developed a deviant set of rules to continue its work and facilitate daily life for its participants. The academic theory of the courtroom workgroup has four cornerstone concepts that recognize this fact: Speed, Pragmatic Cynicism, Collegiality, and Secrecy. Efficient courtroom workgroups seek to process cases rather than dispense justice. This has been confirmed to greater and lesser extents in different courts.  [[Defendant]]s are assumed to be guilty. The procedural merits of the case are the true determinative factors of an outcome. Prosecutors and defense attorneys engage in a comparison of charges against possible procedural flaws and possible defenses to arrive at the going rate for a crime.  These factors are used to determine how much punishment the plea bargain will offer.  For example, group relationships and the desire to "maintain" a healthy working relationship are important to group members. The workings of the courtroom group and the "going rate" for given crimes are not matters for public disclosure. Estimates can be given to clients, but usually couched in terms of the prosecution's willingness to negotiate. (Summarized by O'Connor, T.R., 2005)

The courtroom workgroup is a mechanism for [[prosecutorial discretion]].  Various techniques are used to convince the defendant that the evidence against him or her is overwhelming.  “Charge stacking” is a process by which police and prosecutors create a case with numerous charges or numerous instances of the same charge to convince the defendant that the risk of not pleading guilty is intolerable.  The defendant may be convinced to plead guilty to a few of the charges in return for not being prosecuted for the remaining charges.

The courtroom workgroup is, in some sense, a response to a lack of resources for public defenders.  Defense attorneys in public defender offices often do not have sufficient time to prepare a case in detail for all of their clients.  Further, they often do not have the budget to fully investigate the facts of a case through either staff or private investigators.  They often must rely solely on police reports for such information.  In some jurisdictions, clients do not meet their attorneys until they are in court.  Typically, public defenders will meet briefly with clients in holding facilities or jails.  The defense attorney defends his or her client by seeking less punishment.  Huemann (1977) indicates that many defense attorneys feel pressured to keep up with their caseloads.  This pressure can manifest in the courtroom through rebukes by the judge for delays.  Many subtle pressures combine to encourage participation in the courtroom workgroup.

The concept of a courtroom workgroup is associated with plea bargaining. The courtroom workgroup shows remarkable explanatory power in overburdened courts dealing with large caseloads.  The courtroom workgroup model is best suited to explain jurisdictions where defense attorneys are more or less permanently assigned, but even occasionally appointed lawyers can participate in these practices. While many of the higher level prosecutions still follow the adversarial model, there is evidence that lower-level proceedings follow the courtroom workgroup model. Boland, Brady, Tyson, &amp; Bassler (1983) indicate that approximately 90 percent of criminal cases are settled by plea bargain. This figure appears to be stable over the last twenty years (Rainville &amp; Reaves, 2003). Some collaborative efforts on the part of the courtroom workgroup simply must be present to facilitate this high percentage of pleas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12513">{{Further|List of Cyrillic digraphs}}
{{Cyrillic alphabet}}
The [[Cyrillic script]] family contains a large number of specially treated two-letter combinations, or [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], but few of these are used in [[Slavic languages]]. In a few alphabets, [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]] and even the occasional [[tetragraph]] are used.

In early Cyrillic, the digraphs {{angbr|оу}} and {{angbr|оѵ}} were used for {{IPA|/u/}}. As with the equivalent digraph in Greek, they were reduced to a [[typographic ligature]], {{angbr|ꙋ}}, and are now written {{angbr|у}}. The modern letters {{angbr|ы}} and {{angbr|ю}} started out as digraphs, {{angbr|ъі}} and {{angbr|іо}}. In [[Church Slavonic]] printing practice, both historical and modern, {{angbr|оу}} (which is considered as a letter from the alphabet's point of view) is mostly treated as two individual characters, but {{angbr|ы}} is a single letter. For example, [[letter-spacing]] affects {{angbr|оу}} as if they were two individual letters, and never affects components of {{angbr|ы}}. In a context of [[Old Slavonic language]], {{angbr|шт}} is a digraph that can replace a letter {{angbr|щ}} and vice versa.

Modern Slavic languages written in the Cyrillic alphabet make little or no use of digraphs. There are only two true digraphs: {{angbr|дж}} for {{IPA|/dʐ/}} (Belarusian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian) and {{angbr|дз}} for {{IPA|/dz/}} (Belarusian, Ukrainian). Sometimes these digraphs are even considered as special letters of respective alphabets. In standard Russian, however, the letters in {{angbr|дж}} and {{angbr|дз}} are always pronounced separately. Digraph-like letter pairs include combinations of consonants with the soft sign {{angbr|ь}} (Serbian/Macedonian letters {{angbr|љ}} and {{angbr|њ}} are derived from {{angbr|ль}} and {{angbr|нь}}), and {{angbr|жж}} or {{angbr|зж}} for the uncommon and optional Russian phoneme {{IPA|/ʑː/}}. Native descriptions of Cyrillic writing system often use the term "digraph" to combinations {{angbr|ьо}} and {{angbr|йо}} (Bulgarian, Ukrainian) as they both correspond to a single letter {{angbr|ё}} of Russian and Belarusian alphabets ({{angbr|ьо}} is used for {{IPA|/ʲo/}}, and {{angbr|йо}} for {{IPA|/jo/}}).

Cyrillic uses large numbers of digraphs only when used to write non-Slavic languages; in some languages such as Avar, these are completely regular in formation.

Many [[Caucasian languages]] use {{angbr|ә}} (Abkhaz), {{angbr|у}} (Kabardian), or {{angbr|в}} (Avar) for [[labialization]], for instance Abkhaz {{angbr|дә}} for {{IPA|/dʷ/}} (sometimes {{IPA|[d͡b]}}), just as many of them, like Russian, use {{angbr|ь}} for [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]]. Since such sequences are decomposable, regular forms will not be listed below. (In [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]], {{angbr|ә}} with [[sibilant]]s is equivalent to {{angbr|ьә}}, for instance ж {{IPA|/ʐ/}}, жь {{IPA|/ʒ/~/ʐʲ/}}, жә {{IPA|/ʒʷ/~/ʐʲʷ/}}, but this is predictable phonetic detail.) Similarly, long vowels written double in some languages, such as {{angbr|аа}} for Abkhaz {{IPA|/aː/}} or {{angbr|аюу}} for [[Kirghiz language|Kirghiz]] {{IPA|/ajuː/}} "bear", or with glottal stop, as [[Tajik language|Tajik]] ''аъ'' {{IPA|[aʔ~aː]}}, are not included.

==Archi==
[[Archi language|Archi]]: а́а {{IPA|[áː]}}, аӏ {{IPA|[aˤ]}}, а́ӏ {{IPA|[áˤ]}}, ааӏ {{IPA|[aːˤ]}}, гв {{IPA|[ɡʷ]}}, гь {{IPA|[h]}}, гъ {{IPA|[ʁ]}}, гъв {{IPA|[ʁʷ]}}, гъӏ {{IPA|[ʁˤ]}}, гъӏв {{IPA|[ʁʷˤ]}}, гӏ {{IPA|[ʕ]}}, е́е {{IPA|[éː]}}, еӏ {{IPA|[eˤ]}}, е́ӏ {{IPA|[éˤ]}}, жв {{IPA|[ʒʷ]}}, зв {{IPA|[zʷ]}}, и́и {{IPA|[íː]}}, иӏ {{IPA|[iˤ]}}, кк {{IPA|[kː]}}, кв {{IPA|[kʷ]}}, ккв {{IPA|[kːʷ]}}, кӏ {{IPA|[kʼ]}}, кӏв {{IPA|[kʷʼ]}}, къ {{IPA|[qʼ]}}, къв {{IPA|[q’ʷ]}}, ккъ {{IPA|[qː’]}}, къӏ {{IPA|[qˤʼ]}}, ккъӏ {{IPA|[qːˤʼ]}}, къӏв {{IPA|[qʷˤʼ]}}, ккъӏв {{IPA|[qːʷˤʼ]}}, кь {{IPA|[kʟ̥ʼ]}}, кьв {{IPA|[kʟ̥ʷʼ]}}, лъ {{IPA|[ɬ]}}, ллъ {{IPA|[ɬː]}}, лъв {{IPA|[ɬʷ]}}, ллъв {{IPA|[ɬːʷ]}}, лӏ {{IPA|[kʟ̥]}}, лӏв {{IPA|[kʟ̥ʷ]}}, о́о {{IPA|[óː]}}, оӏ {{IPA|[oˤ]}}, о́ӏ {{IPA|[óˤ]}}, ооӏ {{IPA|[oːˤ]}}, пп {{IPA|[pː]}}, пӏ {{IPA|[pʼ]}}, сс {{IPA|[sː]}}, св {{IPA|[sʷ]}}, тт {{IPA|[tː]}}, тӏ {{IPA|[tʼ]}}, тв {{IPA|[tʷ]}}, твӏ {{IPA|[t’ʷ]}}, у́у {{IPA|[úː]}}, уӏ {{IPA|[uˤ]}}, у́ӏ {{IPA|[úˤ]}}, хх {{IPA|[χː]}}, хв {{IPA|[χʷ]}}, ххв {{IPA|[χːʷ]}}, хӏ {{IPA|[ħ]}}, хьӏ {{IPA|[χˤ]}}, ххьӏ {{IPA|[χːˤ]}}, хьӏв {{IPA|[χʷˤ]}}, ххьӏв {{IPA|[χːʷˤ]}}, хъ {{IPA|[q]}}, хъв {{IPA|[qʷ]}}, хъӏ {{IPA|[qˤ]}}, хъӏв {{IPA|[qʷˤ]}}, цв {{IPA|[t͡sʷ]}}, цӏ {{IPA|[t͡sʼ]}}, ццӏ {{IPA|[t͡sː]}}, чв {{IPA|[t͡ʃʷ]}}, чӏ {{IPA|[t͡ʃʼ]}}, чӏв {{IPA|[t͡ʃ’ʷ]}}, шв {{IPA|[ʃʷ]}}, щв {{IPA|[ʃːʷ]}}, ээ {{IPA|[əː]}}, эӏ {{IPA|[əˤ]}}

==Avar==
[[Avar language|Avar]] uses {{angbr|в}} for labialization, as in хьв {{IPA|/xʷ/}}. Other digraphs are:
*[[Ejective consonant]]s in {{angbr|ӏ}}: кӏ {{IPA|/kʼ/}}, цӏ {{IPA|/tsʼ/}}, чӏ {{IPA|/tʃʼ/}}
*Other consonants based on к {{IPA|/k/}}: къ {{IPA|/qʼː/}}, кь {{IPA|/tɬʼː/}},
*Based on г {{IPA|/ɡ/}}: гъ {{IPA|/ʁ/}}, гь {{IPA|/h/}}, гӏ {{IPA|/ʕ/}}
*Based on л {{IPA|/l/}}: лъ {{IPA|/tɬː/}}
*Based on х {{IPA|/χ/}}: хъ {{IPA|/qː/}}, хь {{IPA|/x/}}, хӏ {{IPA|/ħ/}}

The ь digraphs are spelled this way even before vowels, as in {{lang|av|гьабуна}} {{IPA|/habuna/}} "made", not *гябуна.

*Gemination: кк {{IPA|/kː/}}, кӏкӏ {{IPA|/kʼː/}}, хх {{IPA|/χː/}}, цц {{IPA|/tsː/}}, цӏцӏ {{IPA|/tsʼː/}}, чӏчӏ {{IPA|/tʃʼː/}}.
Note that three of these are tetragraphs. However, gemination for the 'strong' consonants in Avar orthography is sporadic, and the simple letters or digraphs are frequently used in their place.

==Chechen and Ingush==
[[Chechen language|Chechen]] uses the following digraphs:
*Vowels: аь {{IPA|/æ/}}, яь {{IPA|/jæ/}}, оь {{IPA|/ø/}}, ёь {{IPA|/jø/}}, уь {{IPA|/y/}}, юь {{IPA|/jy/}}
*Ejectives in {{angbr|ӏ}}: кӏ {{IPA|/kʼ/}}, пӏ {{IPA|/pʼ/}}, тӏ {{IPA|/tʼ/}}, цӏ {{IPA|/tsʼ/}}, чӏ {{IPA|/tʃʼ/}}
*Other consonants: гӏ {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, кх {{IPA|/q/}}, къ {{IPA|/qʼ/}}, хь {{IPA|/ħ/}}, хӏ {{IPA|/h/}}
*The trigraph рхӏ {{IPA|/r̥/}}

In [[Ingush language|Ingush]], there are no ejectives, so for example ''кӏ'' is pronounced {{IPA|/k/}}. Some of the other values are also different: аь {{IPA|/æ/}} ''etc.'', уь {{IPA|/ɨ/}} ''etc.'', кх {{IPA|/qχ/}} (vs. къ {{IPA|/q/}}), хь {{IPA|/ç/}}

The vowel digraphs are used for front vowels for other [[Dagestanian languages]] and also the local Turkic languages [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]] and [[Nogay language|Nogay]]. {{angbr|Ӏ}} digraphs for ejectives is common across the North Caucasus, as is гӏ for {{IPA|/ɣ~ʁ~ʕ/}}.

==Kabardian==
[[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] uses {{angbr|у}} for labialization, as ӏу {{IPA|/ʔʷ/}}. гу is {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}}, though г is {{IPA|/ɣ/}}); ку is {{IPA|/kʷ/}}, despite the fact that к is not used outside [[loan word]]s. Other digraphs are:

==Tatar==
[[Tatar language|Tatar]] has a number of vowels which are written with ambiguous letters that are normally resolved by context, but which are resolved by discontinuous digraphs when context is not sufficient. These ambiguous vowel letters are е, [[front vowel|front]] {{IPA|/je/}} or [[back vowel|back]] {{IPA|/jɤ/}}, ю, front {{IPA|/jy/}} or back {{IPA|/ju/}}; and я, front {{IPA|/jæ/}} or back {{IPA|/ja/}}. They interact with the ambiguous consonant letters к, [[velar consonant|velar]] {{IPA|/k/}} or [[uvular consonant|uvular]] {{IPA|/q/}}, and г, velar {{IPA|/ɡ/}} or uvular {{IPA|/ʁ/}}.

In general, velar consonants occur before front vowels and uvular consonants before back vowels, so it is frequently not necessary to specify these values in the orthography. However, this is not always the case. A uvular followed by a front vowel, as in {{IPA|/qærdæʃ/}} "kinsman", for example, is written with the corresponding back vowel to specify the uvular value: кардәш. The front value of а is required by [[vowel harmony]] with the following front vowel ә, so this spelling is unambiguous.

If, however, the proper value of the vowel is not recoverable by through vowel harmony, then the letter ь {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is added at the end of the syllable, as in {{lang|tt|шагыйрь}} {{IPA|/ʃaʁir/}} "poet". That is, {{IPA|/i/}} is written with a ы rather than a и to show that the г is pronounced {{IPA|/ʁ/}} rather than {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, then the ь is added to show that the ы is pronounced as if it were a и, so the discontinuous digraph ы...ь is used here to write the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. This strategy is also followed with the ambiguous letters е, ю, and я in final syllables, for instance in {{lang|tt|юнь}} {{IPA|/jyn/}} ''cheap''. That is, the discontinuous digraphs е...ь, ю...ь, я...ь are used for {{IPA|/j/}} plus the front vowels {{IPA|/e, y, æ/}}.

Exceptional final-syllable velars and uvulars, however, are written with simple digraphs, with ь for velars and ъ for uvulars: {{lang|tt|пакь}} {{IPA|/pak/}} ''pure'', {{lang|tt|вәгъдә}} {{IPA|/wæʁdæ/}} ''promise''.

The '''Dark Enlightenment''', or the '''neoreactionary movement'''—also known simply as '''neoreaction''' and abbreviated '''NRx''' by its proponents—is an [[Anti-democratic thought|anti-democratic]] and [[reactionary]] movement that considers itself to be the antithesis to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. It broadly rejects [[egalitarianism]] and the view that history shows inevitable progression towards greater liberty and enlightenment, thus it is in part a reaction against "[[Whig history|Whig historiography]]".&lt;ref name="TB"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pein|first=Corey|date=19 May 2014|title=Mouthbreathing Machiavellis Dream of a Silicon Reich|url=http://thebaffler.com/blog/mouthbreathing-machiavellis|newspaper=The Baffler|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209130630/http://thebaffler.com/blog/mouthbreathing-machiavellis|archivedate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TDT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartlett|first=Jamie|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/jamiebartlett/100012093/meet-the-dark-enlightenment-sophisticated-neo-fascism-thats-spreading-fast-on-the-net/|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Meet The Dark Enlightenment: sophisticated neo-fascism that's spreading fast on the net|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement favors a return to older [[Social constructionism|societal constructs]] and forms of government, including support for [[monarchism]] and other forms of leadership such as a "neo[[Cameralism|cameralist]] CEO"&lt;ref name=behind&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/behind-the-internets-dark-anti-democracy-movement/516243/|title=Behind the Internet's Anti-Democracy Movement|date=10 February 2017|website=The Atlantic|last=Gray|first=Rosie}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock]] republic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448230/problems-mencius-moldbug-neoreaction|title=Against Mencius Moldbug's 'Neoreaction'|author=Steorts, Jason Lee|date=5 June 2017|publisher=National Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with a [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]], [[Conservatism|conservative]] or [[Economic nationalism|economic nationalist]] approach to economics.&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew|last=Walther|url=http://spectator.org/blog/57516/dark-enlightenment-silly-not-scary|title=The Dark Enlightenment Is Silly Not Scary|website=[[The American Spectator]]|date=23 January 2014|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents generally also espouse [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] views on such matters as [[gender role]]s, [[Sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]] and [[Human migration|migration]].

== Summary of core ideas &lt;!--'Neocameralism' redirects here--&gt; ==
[[File:Mencius Moldbug.jpg|thumb|[[Curtis Yarvin]], an early exponent of neoreactionary thought]]
Some of the impetus for the neoreactionary movement comes from libertarians like [[Peter Thiel]] as indicated by [[Nick Land]]'s essay "The Dark Enlightenment", which noted how libertarian thinkers at an April 2009 ''[[Cato Unbound]]'' discussion expressed skepticism about the compatibility of freedom and democracy.&lt;ref name="land-tde"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedarkenlightenment.com/the-dark-enlightenment-by-nick-land/|title=The Dark Enlightenment|author=Land, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Thiel and [[Patri Friedman]] have backed the [[Seasteading Institute]] as one possible way of building fiefdoms free of outside regulation and law.&lt;ref name="TB"/&gt;

Neoreactionary Michael Perilloux proposes that President [[Donald Trump]] seize more power by canceling the [[United States Constitution]], declaring [[martial law]] and replacing the government with [[The Trump Organization]].&lt;ref name="warmed"/&gt; Similarly, Google engineer [[Justine Tunney]] [[Justine Tunney#Petition to install a .22CEO of America.22|circulated a petition]] to appoint Google chairman [[Eric Schmidt]] as CEO of America.&lt;ref name="TB" /&gt;

Some neoreactionary futurists focus more on the use of technology to defeat the state, for example, through transhumanist [[accelerationism]] in which the select few free themselves from the bonds of the state by evolving into superintelligent human-computer hybrids.&lt;ref name="terrifying" /&gt; One proponent of such ideas is Michael Anissimov, an advocate of [[eugenics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Specter of Eugenics: IQ, White Supremacy, and Human Enhancement|author=Abbott, Benjamin|date=5 June 2013|publisher=Ethical Technology|url=https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/abbott20130605}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in the words of Mark O'Connell "has in recent years basically cornered the [[white supremacy|white-supremacy]]–[[technological singularity|singularity]] crossover market" and become "something of a pariah from the transhumanist movement". Rejecting the notion that all humans are created equal, Anissimov believes that there are already [[race and intelligence|disparities in intelligence between existing races]] and that transhuman technologies will create further disparities in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/04/the-techno-libertarians-praying-for-dystopia.html|title=The Techno-Libertarians Praying for Dystopia|author=O'Connell, Mark|publisher=New York Magazine|date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that aristocratic systems are more financially stable and less wasteful than democratic or communist systems.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: Geeks for Monarchy"/&gt;

== History and etymology&lt;!--'Formalism (Yarvin)' redirects here--&gt;==
Dylan Matthews argues that neoreaction draws on the racialist, traditionalist and isolationist arguments of [[paleoconservatism]] as well as paleoconservatives' belief that the mainstream is trying to crush them. Differences between the two movements are that paleoconservatives are more religious and have more faith in the United States Constitution and republican ideals generally.&lt;ref name=warmed&gt;{{cite web|title=The alt-right is more than warmed-over white supremacy.

In 2007 and 2008, [[Curtis Yarvin]]—writing under the [[pen name]] Mencius Moldbug—articulated what would develop into Dark Enlightenment thinking. Yarvin's theories were later the subject of Nick Land, who first coined the term "Dark Enlightenment" in his essay of the same name.&lt;ref name="land-tde" /&gt; The term "Dark Enlightenment" is a play-on-words for the knowledge supposedly gained in the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="TDT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: Geeks for Monarchy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jon|last=Phillips|url=https://secure.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2014/fall/Troublesome-Sources|title=Troublesome Sources|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=Fall 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Land: "Where the progressive enlightenment sees political ideals, the dark enlightenment sees appetites"&lt;ref name="land-tde"/&gt;—on the view that the tendency of sovereign power (in democracies) is to devour society.

Yarvin had originally called his ideology '''formalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a term inspired from [[legal formalism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A formalist manifesto|url = http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/04/formalist-manifesto-originally-posted.html|website = Unqualified Reservations|accessdate = 21 June 2015|date = 23 April 2007|last = Moldbug|first = Mencius}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Arnold Kling]] used the term "The Neo-Reactionaries" as a noun in July 2010 to describe Moldbug and fellows and the term was quickly adopted by the subculture.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: Geeks for Monarchy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/07/the_neo-reactio.html|first=Arnold|last=Kling|authorlink=Arnold Kling|title=The Neo-Reactionaries|work=EconLog|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty|date=18 July 2010|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adam Riggio, the embryo of the neoreactionary movement lived in the community pages of [[LessWrong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://social-epistemology.com/2016/09/23/the-violence-of-pure-reason-neoreaction-a-basilisk-adam-riggio/|title=The Violence of Pure Reason|author=Riggio, Adam|publisher=Social Epistemology Review &amp; Reply Collective|date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social Matter'' is a major online publication and thought machine for neoreaction.&lt;ref name=risealt&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Rise of the Alt-Right Movement|author=Summers, Ryan T.|journal=Media and Communication Studies Summer Fellows|url=http://digitalcommons.ursinus.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=media_com_sum|date=2017|number=11| page=6 | quote=The ideology is also enthralled with hyper-masculine visions of men. In Post-Anathema, a Tumblr page, common images depict soldiers with guns, tanks, spacecraft, and Greek Gods.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoreactionaries have often declined reporters' requests for interviews, explaining that journalists—as [[Manufacturing Consent|manufacturers of consent]]—are their mortal enemy. When ''[[The Atlantic]]'' political affairs reporter [[Rosie Gray]] attempted to interview neoreactionary leaders, Yarvin suggested she instead "speak directly to my WH [[Cut-out (espionage)|cutout]] / [[Clandestine cell system|cell]] leader"—a sarcastic reference to widely reported yet unsubstantiated rumors that Yarvin had ties to [[White House Chief Strategist]] [[Steve Bannon]]—while Nick B. Steves told her she was ill-suited to write about neo-reaction because "115 IQ people are not generally well equipped to summarize 160 IQ people".&lt;ref name=behind/&gt;

Ryan Summers wrote that neoreactionary imagery is often infused with hyper-masculine ideas of men, such as tanks, spacecraft, Greek Gods and soldiers with guns.&lt;ref name=risealt/&gt;

== Relation to other movements ==
=== Relation to the alt-right ===
Some consider the Dark Enlightenment as an early school of thought in the [[alt-right]],&lt;ref name="qz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/how-2015-fueled-the-rise-of-the-freewheeling-white-nationali|title=How 2015 Fueled The Rise Of The Freewheeling, White Nationalist Alt Right Movement|last=Gray|first=Rosie|date=28 December 2015|website=BuzzFeed|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as its most theoretically minded branch.&lt;ref name=warmed/&gt; In particular, one philosopher with Landian ideas, [[Jason Reza Jorjani]], co-founded AltRight.com and spoke at the 2016 [[National Policy Institute]] conference led by white supremacist [[Richard B.

But then, the NRx analysis is that the age of the masses is virtually over. Riled-up populist movements are part of what is passing, rather than of what is slouching toward Bethlehem to be born.}}
James Kirchick notes that although neoreactionary thinkers disdain the masses and claim to despise populism and people more generally, what ties them to the rest of the alt-right is their unapologetically racist element, their shared [[misanthropy]] and their resentment of mismanagement by the ruling elites.&lt;ref name=terrifying&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/trumps-terrifying-online-brigades/|title=Trump’s Terrifying Online Brigades|author=Kirchick, James|date=16 May 2016|publisher=Commentary Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duesterberg observes: "As a rule the alt right is scattered, anonymous and obscure—thriving, as the curious metaphor has it, in the 'dark corners of the internet.' By contrast, neoreaction is centralized and public: darkness enlightened".&lt;ref name=final&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thepointmag.com/2017/politics/final-fantasy-neoreactionary-politics-liberal-imagination|title=Final Fantasy|author=Duesterberg, James|publisher=The Point|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of neoreaction is that its pessimistic appraisal of [[progressivism]]'s results dismisses many advances that have been made, including greater freedom for women, racial minorities and homosexuals; increased security for the elderly and unemployed; greater access to health care by the poor; steep declines in world [[poverty]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/brin20131130|author=Brin, David|publisher=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|date=30 November 2013|title="Neo-Reactionaries" drop all pretense: End democracy and bring back lords!}}&lt;/ref&gt; improved [[air quality]]; greater [[religious tolerance]] and [[racial integration]]; lower [[crime rate]]s; and an absence of [[world war]]s since 1945. They also point to the culture of London, whose population is 40 percent nonwhite; and the high standard of living and continental peace in the [[European Union]]. Another criticism is that [[Economic globalization#Global supply chain|global manufacturing patterns]] limit the economic independence that sovereign states can have from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sullivan, Andrew|date=30 April 2017|title=Why the reactionary right must be taken seriously|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/andrew-sullivan-why-the-reactionary-right-must-be-taken-seriously.html|publisher=New York Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the critics who felt the Dark Enlightenment's pessimistic assessment was unsupported by economic data formed the Grey Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/19/eigenmorality-and-the-dark-enlightenment/|date=19 July 2014|publisher=TechCrunch|author=Evans, Jon|title=Eigenmorality And The Dark Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan T. Summers observes: "For the most part, neoreactionaries do not emphasize anti-Semitic views as other alt-right counterparts".&lt;ref name="risealt" /&gt;

[[File:Public documents of the legislature of Connecticut, session (1882) (14763332785).jpg|thumb|alt=A drawing of the American Sign Language manual alphabet|[[Sign language]]s are an important part of Deaf culture. The American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet is shown here.]]

The '''Deaf rights movement''' encompasses a series of [[social movements]] within the [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]] and [[Cultural diversity|cultural diversity movements]] that encourages [[Deaf|deaf and hard of hearing]] to push society to adopt a position of equal respect for them. Acknowledging that those who were hearing impaired had rights to obtain the same things as those with no hearing impairments lead this movement. Establishing an educational system to teach those with hearing impairments was one of the first accomplishments of this movement. Sign language, as well as cochlear implants, has also had an extensive impact on the Deaf community. These have all been aspects that have paved the way for those with hearing impairments, which began with the Deaf Rights movement.  
== Deaf education ==
{{main article|Deaf education}}

===Oralism===
{{main article|Oralism}}
Oralism focuses on teaching deaf students through oral communicative means rather than sign languages.

There is strong opposition within Deaf communities to the [[Oralism|oralist]] method of teaching deaf children to speak and [[Lip reading|lip read]] with limited or no use of [[sign language]] in the classroom. The method is intended to make it easier for deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but the benefits of learning in such an environment are disputed. The use of [[sign language]] is also central to Deaf [[Cultural identity|identity]] and attempts to limit its use are viewed as an attack.

=== Deaf schools ===
Parents of deaf children also have to opportunity to send their children to deaf schools, where the curriculum is taught in [[American Sign Language]]. The first school for the education of deaf individuals was the Connecticut Asylum for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Persons, which opened on April 15, 1817.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was a coeducation insitiution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/dhm/edu/essay.html?id=38|title=Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb|last=Crowley|first=John|website=www.disabilitymuseum.org|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This school was later renamed the [[American School for the Deaf]], and was granted federal money to set up of deaf institutions around the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many teachers in these schools were women, because according to PBS and the research done for the film ''Through Deaf Eyes'', they were  better at instructing due to the patience it took to do something repetitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/throughdeafeyes/deaflife/women.html|title=Oral Education and Women in the Classroom|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American School for the Deaf was set up based on a British model of education for deaf individuals with instruction in the subjects of reading, writing, history, math, and an advanced study of the Bible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gallaudet University]] is the only deaf university in the world, which instructs in American Sign Language, and promotes research and publications for the deaf community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.gallaudet.edu/attend-gallaudet/about-gallaudet/|title = Gallaudet University|website = www2.gallaudet.edu|access-date = 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaudet University is responsible for expanding services and education for deaf individuals in developing countries around the world, as well as in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Reviewing The Pioneering Roles Of Gallaudet University Alumni In Advancing Deaf Education And Services In Developing Countries: Insights And Challenges From Nigeria." ''American Annals Of The Deaf'' 2 (2015): 75. ''Project MUSE''. Web. 15 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many deaf individuals choose to be educated in a deaf environment for their college level education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Deaf President Now ===
{{main article|Deaf President Now}}

[[I. King Jordan]] had made history in 1988 for becoming the first deaf president of [[Gallaudet University]] after the protest, ''Deaf President Now'' Students, with the support of from many alumni, faculty, staff and friends, protested the Board of Trustees' continued appointments of  hearing presidents over highly qualified deaf candidates in an institution established to serve the deaf.

=== Historical figures===
{{Main articles|List of deaf people}}
There have been many individuals who have made advancements in the deaf community. These individuals have been both deaf or hearing. A few of the most recognizable names include:
[[Alexander Graham Bell]], who is known for the invention of the telephone but to the Deaf, is seen as a villain of sorts; 
[[Heather Whitestone]], the first deaf Miss-America; 
[[Marlee Matlin]], a well known deaf actress;
[[Laurent Clerc]], a well-known deaf professor; and 
[[Helen Keller]], the most commonly known deaf-blind woman.

However, this is only a small number of individuals who have made advancements in the deaf community.

== Public accommodations ==
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], also known as the ADA, has made a huge impact on the deaf community. In 1990 it was a landmark for people with disabilities. The ADA has been a great benefit for hard of hearing and deaf people to help them gain every aspect of life that a hearing person has. The ADA took the important principles in these laws and extended them to the broad mainstream of Americans public life. It prohibits discrimination in almost every aspect of society.(26)  Meaning you would have a legitimate reason to not hire someone with a disability.  The legislation provides legal protection in employment(Title I), access to state and local government and public transportation (title II), public accommodations (Title III)(they have to provide a translator), and telecommunications (title IV). (26) George H W Bush signed this into act, and there was no acclaimed retaliation from this. It didn’t solve the problem of discrimination but it gave those who had a disability protection.

In 1975 Congress found that more than eight million children were not receiving equal education. There was another bill passed to help solve this problem called the Individual with Disabilities Act (IDEA). The IDEA was made to "ensure that all children with disabilities have access to a free, appropriate, public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their needs and prepare them for employment and independent living. To ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents are protected. To assist states, localities, educational service agencies, and federal agencies to pay for education for all children with disabilities. And finally to assess and ensure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities." (73)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=National, A. O. T. D. (2015). Legal Rights, 6th Ed. : The Guide for Deaf and Hard of Hearing People. Washington, DC, US: Gallaudet University Press.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deaf culture movement ==
{{main article|Deaf culture}}

Deaf culture is a culture defined by usage of sign language and many cultural and social norms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Cochlear implants===
Within the [[Deaf culture|Deaf community]], there is strong opposition to the use of [[cochlear implants]] and sometimes also [[hearing aids]] and similar technologies. This is often justified in terms of a rejection of the view that [[deafness]], as a condition, is something that needs to be ''fixed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=Bonnie Poitras|title=Deaf Culture, Cochlear Implants, and Elective Disability|journal=Hastings Center Report|date=8 July 1998|volume=28|issue=4|pages=6-14|doi=10.2307/3528607|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3528607|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that this technology also threatens the continued existence of Deaf culture, but Kathryn Woodcock argues that it is a greater threat to [[Deaf culture]] ''to reject prospective members just because they used to hear, because their parents chose an implant for them, because they find environmental sound useful, etc''.&lt;ref name="woodcock1992"&gt;{{cite book | first=Kathryn | last=Woodcock | year=1992 | title=Cochlear Implants vs. Deaf Culture? In Mervin Garretson (ed.), ''Viewpoints on Deafness: A Deaf American Monograph''. Silver Spring, MD: National Association for the Deaf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochlear implants may improve the perception of sound for suitable implantees, but they do not reverse [[deafness]], or create a normal perception of sounds. The Deaf community still insists that a child not be fitted with a cochlear implant until old enough to decide for themselves because the affects are irreversible and could cause a lifetime of pain, regret, and hatred/isolation.

[[Image:University of Edinburgh, Old College.jpg|thumb|right|Old College, home to the [[University of Edinburgh School of Law|Edinburgh School of Law]]]]
The '''Diploma in Legal Practice''' (from its introduction in 1980 until 2012/13) or '''Diploma in Professional Legal Practice''' (from 2012/13) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] postgraduate qualification required in order to practise law in Scotland, as either a [[Solicitor#Scotland|solicitor]] or an [[Advocate#Advocates in Scotland|advocate]]. It is undertaken after completing undergraduate study and before commencing a traineeship.

The course is intended to provide students with the more practical skills they will require after academic study, comprising compulsory modules in conveyancing, civil court practice, criminal court practice, private client, financial services and related skills, accountancy and professional responsibility, with a choice of either company and commercial or public administration.

Until the start of the 2012/13 academic year, the Diploma attracted a quota of funded places from the [[Student Awards Agency for Scotland]] (SAAS), set at three hundred. The funding extended to a contribution of around £3,000 towards fees and a means-tested subsistence allowance. Fees for the Diploma range from £6,630 - £7,700.&lt;ref name="Guidance Note"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Law Society of Scotland|title=GUIDANCE NOTE FOR STUDENTS: THE DIPLOMA IN PROFESSIONAL LEGAL PRACTICE|url=http://www.lawscot.org.uk/media/1019569/Diploma-guidance-note-2017-18.pdf|website=Law Society of Scotland|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012/13, as part of a wider review of funding for postgraduate courses, the [[Scottish Government]] announced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2011/11/24100419|title=Postgraduate funding access widened|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|date=2011-11-24|website=www.scotland.gov.uk|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes to the way in which postgraduate courses would be funded, including the Diploma, which became the Diploma in Professional Legal Practice. Since the change students may apply to SAAS for a loan (£3,400 {{As of|2014|lc=on}}) towards the cost of tuition.  There was considerable criticism of the postgraduate funding, in particular that the changes made did not do enough to widen access to the Scottish legal profession.

{{Companies law}}

In [[corporate law]], the '''directors register''' is a list of the [[board of directors|directors]] elected by the [[shareholders]], generally stored in the company's [[minute book]].  By law, companies are required to keep this list up to date to remove those directors who are deceased or resign, and to add those who have been elected by the shareholders. However, the register must also list any person who had been a director indefinitely.  The record must indicate the dates a director started and stopped holding office. As directors carry certain personal legal obligations to a corporation (for example, being responsible for any money held in [[Trust law|trust]] for another person, e.g. [[sales taxes]] not remitted to a government), those seeking recourse against directors are allowed to rely on the directors register as proof that a director held office on any particular day.

In many jurisdictions, corporations are required to keep the list of directors up to date with the corporate affairs office where the corpororation was incorporated. This is so that both government agencies and interested third parties may be aware of the name and address of directors (for example, in order to serve a [[statement of claim]] on the corporation).

[[Publicly traded corporations]] are usually required to notify the appropriate securities and exchange commission about any change to their directors register.

'''Elizabeth (Betsy) Baldwin Garland''' is an American [[archaeologist]] known for her expertise on Great Lakes [[prehistory]] and the archaeology of [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="WMU" /&gt; She is the author of a number of scholarly publications.&lt;ref name="TrowelBlazers" /&gt;

==Biography==
Garland earned  a BS in geology from [[Wellesley College]], an MA in [[Anthropology]] from [[Radcliffe College]], and a PhD. from Harvard in anthropology in 1967.&lt;ref name="TrowelBlazers"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mangold |first1=BIll |title=Elizabeth Baldwin Garland |url=https://trowelblazers.com/elizabeth-baldwin-garland/ |website=TrowelBlazers |accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Garland was offered a teaching position in the anthropology department at [[Western Michigan University]] (WMU).&lt;ref name="WMU"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Marie |title=WMU honors archaeologist as Outstanding Emeritus Scholar|url=https://www.wmich.edu/wmu/news/2000/0002/9900-179.html |website=WMU News |publisher=Western Michigan University |accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first archaeologist on the faculty at WMU. In 1966, Garland helped create WMU's [[archaeology]] program in the department of anthropology, as well as a joint field school with [[Michigan State University]].&lt;ref name="WMU" /&gt;

Garland led numerous excavations in [[Michigan]], including several surveys of the Kalamazoo River basin.&lt;ref name="WMU" /&gt;

The '''Emerald Buddha''' ({{lang-th|พระแก้วมรกต}} {{transl|th|''Phra Kaeo Morakot''}}, or {{lang|th|พระพุทธมหามณีรัตนปฏิมากร}} {{transl|th|''Phra Phuttha Maha Mani Rattana Patimakon''}}) is considered the [[Palladium (protective image)|palladium]] of the [[Thailand|Kingdom of Thailand]].&lt;ref name="bicentennial"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EricRoeder/&gt; It is a [[figurine]] of the meditating [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] seated in [[Yoga|yogic]] posture, made of a semi-precious green stone ([[jade]] or [[jasper]] rather than [[emerald]]), clothed in [[gold]],&lt;ref name=gardner&gt;{{cite book |title=Gardner’s Art through the Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rofCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page= 1045 |edition=15th |editor=Fred S Kleiner |isbn=9781285838151 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and about {{convert|26|in|cm|0}} tall.&lt;ref name="bangkok"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangkokforvisitors.com/ratanakosin/grand-palace/emerald-buddha-temple/emerald-buddha-chapel.php |title=Chapel of the Emerald Buddha |work=Bangkok For Visitors }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the ''Temple of the Emerald Buddha'' ([[Wat Phra Kaew]]) on the grounds of the [[Grand Palace, Bangkok|Grand Palace]] in [[Bangkok]].&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Grand Palace (8278415631).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The [[Wat Phra Kaew]] chapel where the Emerald Buddha is now kept in Bangkok]]
Historical sources indicate that the statue surfaced in northern [[Thailand]] in the Lanna kingdom in 1434. One account of its discovery tells that lightning struck a [[Stupa|chedi]] in [[Wat Phra Kaew, Chiang Rai|Wat Pa Yia]] (Bamboo Forest Monastery, later renamed [[Wat Phra Kaew, Chiang Rai|Wat Phra Kaew]]) in [[Chiang Rai]], revealing a Buddha covered with [[stucco]] inside. The Buddha was then placed in the abbot's residence, who later noticed that stucco on the nose had flaked off, revealing a green interior. The abbot removed  the stucco and found a Buddha figure carved from a green semi-precious stone, which became known as ''Phra Kaew Morakot'' or in English the Emerald Buddha. ("Emerald" refers to its "green colour" in Thai, not its composition.)&lt;ref name=SubhadradisDiskul&gt;{{cite book|last=Diskul|first=Subhadradis|title=History of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha|publisher=Bureau of the Royal Household|publication-place=Bangkok|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams2&gt;{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=China|author2=Aaron Anderson |author3=Brett Atkinson |author4=Becca Blond |author5=Tim Bewer |title= Thailand|pages=350–352|accessdate=27 March 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oc0LoROKM0MC&amp;pg=PA350#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher= Lonely Planet|year=2010|isbn= 9781742203850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some art historians describe the Emerald Buddha as belonging to the [[Chiang Saen District#History|Chiang Saen Style]] of the 15th century AD, which would mean it is of Thai [[Lanna]] origin.

[[File:Wat Phra Kaeo Chiang Rai.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Wat Phra Kaeo, Chiang Rai|Wat Phra Kaeo]] in Chiang Rai, where the Emerald Buddha was found]]
King Sam Fang Kaen of Lanna wanted it in his capital, [[Chiang Mai]], but the elephant carrying it insisted, on three separate occasions, on going instead to [[Lampang]]. This was taken as a divine sign, and the Emerald Buddha stayed in Lampang in a specially-built temple (now [[Wat Phra Kaeo Don Tao]]) for the next 32 years.  In 1468, it was moved to Chiang Mai by King Tiloka, where it was kept in a niche in a large stupa called [[Wat Chedi Luang|Chedi Luang]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ait.ac.th/wutt/wat.html |title=The History of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha |author= M.C. Subhaddradis Diskul|work= Asian Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emerald Buddha remained in Chiang Mai until 1552, when it was taken to [[Luang Prabang]], then the capital of the [[Laos|Lao]] kingdom of [[Lan Xang]]. Some years earlier, the crown prince of Lan Xang, [[Setthathirath]], had been invited to occupy the vacant throne of Lanna as his mother was the daughter of the king of Chiang Mai who had died without a son.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; However, Prince Setthathirath also became king of Lan Xang when his father, [[Photisarath]], died. He returned home, taking the revered Buddha figure with him.{{cn|date=March 2017}} 
[[File:Ho Phra Keo 0528.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Haw Phra Kaew]] in Vientiane where it was held for 214 years]]

In 1564, King Setthathirath moved it to [[Vientiane]], which he had made his new capital due to Burmese attacks and where the Buddha image was housed in [[Haw Phra Kaew]].&lt;ref name=KarenSchurNarula&gt;{{cite book|last=Narula|first=Karen|title=Voyage of the Emerald Buddha|publisher=Oxford University Press|publication-place=Kuala Lumpur|year=1994|page=88|isbn=978-9-676-53057-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Buddha image would stay in Vientiane for the next 214 years.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1779, the Thai General [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|Chao Phraya Chakri]] put down an insurrection, captured Vientiane and took the Emerald Buddha to Siam. It was installed in a shrine close to [[Wat Arun]] in [[Thonburi]], its new capital. Chao Phra Chakri then took over the reins and founded the [[Chakri Dynasty]] of [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]. He adopted the title [[Rama I]] and shifted his capital across the Menam Chao Phra river to its present location in Bangkok, and constructed the new [[Grand Palace]] including [[Wat Phra Kaew]] within its compound. Wat Phra Kaew was consecrated in 1784, and the Emerald Buddha was moved with great pomp and pageantry to its current home in the ''[[Ubosoth]]'' of the Wat Phra Kaew temple complex on 22 March 1784.&lt;ref name=EricRoeder/&gt;

==Legends==
[[File:EmeraldBuddha-Thailand-PeterMaas.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|View of the Emerald Buddha in rainy season attire on its pedestal]]
The legend of the Emerald Buddha is related in number of sources such as ''[[Jinakalamali]]'', ''Amarakatabuddharupanidana'', and in particular ''Ratanabimbavamsa'' or ''The Chronicle of the Emerald Buddha'' written in Pali by Brahmarājapañña in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNnsCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Buddhist Studies in Honour of I.B.

Nagasena alledegly had the help of Hindu god [[Vishnu]] and the demigod [[Indra]], 500 years after Buddha attained [[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]]. He was said to have predicted:&lt;ref name=EricRoeder/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
This figure of the Buddha is assuredly going to give to religion the most brilliant importance in five lands, that is in Lankadvipa ([[Sri Lanka]]), Ramalakka, [[Dvaravati]], [[Chieng Mai]] and [[Lan Xang|Lan Chang]] ([[Laos]]).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The legends state that after remaining in Pataliputra for three hundred years, it was taken to [[Sri Lanka]] to save it from a civil war. A version of the legend stated that in 457, King Anuruth of [[Burma]] sent a mission to Ceylon to ask for [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist scriptures]] and the Emerald Buddha, in order to support [[Buddhism]] in his country. These requests were granted, but the ship lost its way in a storm during the return voyage and landed in [[Cambodia]]. When the Thais captured [[Angkor Wat]] in 1432 (following the ravage of the bubonic plague), the Emerald Buddha was taken to [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]], [[Kamphaeng Phet]], Laos and finally [[Chiang Rai]], where the ruler of the city hid it until it was found in 1434.&lt;ref name=EricRoeder&gt;{{cite web|first=Eric|last=Roeder|title=The Origin and Significance of the Emerald Buddha|journal=Explorations in Southeast Asian Studies|volume=3|publisher=Center for Southeast Asian Studies, University of Hawai'i at Manoa|publication-place=Honolulu|year=1999|pages=1, 18|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/2542/The%20Origin%20and%20Significance%20of%20the%20Emerald%20Buddha.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The image==

The Buddha image is made of a semi-precious green stone,&lt;ref name="bicentennial"/&gt; described variously as jade or jasper rather than emerald,&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brittanica&gt;{{citation|contribution=Emerald Buddha (sculpture)|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|contribution-url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/185722/Emerald-Buddha|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "emerald" here refers to its colour rather than the stone.&lt;ref name=Sacred&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/thailand/bangkok-wat-phra-kaew-emerald-buddha|title= Wat Phra Kaew, Bangkok|accessdate=27 March 2010|publisher=Sacred Destinations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image has not been analyzed to determine its exact composition or origin.

The figure is {{convert|19|in|cm|0}} wide at the lap, and {{convert|26|in|cm|0}} high.&lt;ref name="bangkok"/&gt; The Buddha is in a seated position, with the right leg resting on the left one, a style that suggest it might have been carved in the late Chiangsaen or Chiangmai school, not much earlier than the fifteenth century A.D.  However, the meditation pose of the statue was not popular in Thailand but looks very much like some of the Buddha images of Southern India and Sri Lanka, which led some to suggest an origin in India or Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Seasonal attire==

[[Image:Emerald buddha2.jpg|thumb|150px|Closeup of Emerald Buddha in summer season attire]]
The Emerald Buddha is adorned with three different sets of gold seasonal costume; two were made by Rama I, one for the summer and one for the rainy season, and a third made by Rama III for the winter or cool season.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  The clothes are changed by the [[King of Thailand]], or another member of the royal family in his stead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thaibuddhist.com/cool-season-robes-for-the-emerald-buddha/ |title=Cool Season Robes for the Emerald Buddha|date= 19 November 2013 |author= Richard Barrow |work=Buddhism in Thailand }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a ceremony at the changing of the seasons – in the 1st Waning of [[lunar month]]s 4, 8 and 12 (around March, August and November).&lt;ref name="nam"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQkHTnTfup8C&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Moon Thailand|author= Suzanne Nam |page=31 |publisher=Avalon Travel Publishing|edition= 5th |date = 7 February 2012 |asin=B007HMCIS6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the three seasons, the three set of costumes for the Emerald Buddha:&lt;ref name="bicentennial"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sights of Rattanakosin |publisher=Committee for the Rattanakosin Bicentennial Celebration |editor=Pasit Charoenwong|year=1982 |isbn=978-9747919615 |pages=85–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nam"/&gt;
* Hot/summer season – a stepped, pointed headpiece; a breast pendant; a sash; a number of armlets, bracelets and other items of royal attire. All items are made of enameled gold and embedded with precious and semi-precious stones.
* Rainy season – a pointed headpiece of enameled gold studded with sapphires; a gold-embossed monk's robe draped over one shoulder.
* Cool/winter season – a gold headpiece studded with diamonds; a jewel-fringed gold-mesh shawl draped over the rainy season attire.

The sets of gold clothing not in use at any given time are kept on display in the nearby Pavilion of Regalia, Royal Decorations and Thai Coins on the grounds of the Grand Palace, where the public may view them.

==Ceremonies==

Early in the Bangkok period, the Emerald Buddha used to be taken out of its temple and paraded in the streets to relieve the city and countryside of various calamities (such as [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and [[cholera]]). However, this practice was discontinued during [[Rama IV]]'s reign as it was feared that the image could get damaged during the procession and also a practical line of thinking that Rama IV, a former monk, held: "Diseases are caused by germs, not by evil spirits or the displeasure of the Buddha".&lt;ref name=EricRoeder/&gt;

The image also marks the changing of the seasons in Thailand, with the king presiding over the seasonal ceremonies. It is a significant ritual held at this temple three times a year, whereby the dress of the deity is changed at the start of each of the three seasons.  The astrological dates for the ritual ceremonies, at the changing of the seasons, followed are in the 1st [[Waning Moon]] of [[Lunar calender|Lunar Months]] 4, 8 and 12 (around March, July and November). Rama I initiated this ritual for the hot season and the rainy season, Rama III introduced the ritual for the winter season.&lt;ref name=EricRoeder/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sacred/&gt; The robes, which adorn the image, represent those of monks and the King, depending on the season, a clear indication of highlighting its symbolic role "as Buddha and the King", which role is also enjoined on the Thai King who formally dresses the Emerald Buddha image.&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt; The costume change ritual is performed by the Thai king who is the highest master of ceremonies for all [[Buddhist rite]]s.  During the ceremony, the king first climbs up to the pedestal, cleans the image by wiping away any dust, and changes the gold headdress of the Emerald Buddha.  The king then worships nearby while an attendant performs the elaborate ritual of changing garments.&lt;ref name="nam" /&gt;  The king also sprays holy water upon his subjects waiting outside the ordination hall, a privilege previously afforded only to the princes and officials who were attending the ceremony inside the ubosoth.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Ceremonies are also performed at the Emerald Buddha temple at other occasions such as the [[Chakri Day]] (begun on 6 April 1782), a national holiday to honour founding of the Chakri dynasty. The King and Queen, entourage of the royal family as well as the Prime Minister, officials in the Ministry of Defence, and other government departments, offer prayers at the temple.&lt;ref name=EricRoeder/&gt;

'''Fine Art Photography''' is [[photography]] created in accordance with the vision of the artist as a photographer. Using photography as a medium to bring something to life that only lives in the artist's mind. Simply capturing what you see in an artistic way is the art of photography and not creating fine art. The goal is to express an idea, a message, or an emotion. Fine art photography stands in contrast to representational photography, such as photojournalism, which provides a documentary visual account of specific subjects and events, literally representing objective reality rather than the subjective intent of the photographer; and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services.

''The photography encyclopedia''. New York: Schirmer, 1999. {{ISBN|0-02-865025-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In scholarly articles===
Among the definitions that can be found in scholarly articles are:
* In 1961, [[S. D. Jouhar|Dr S. D.Jouhar]] founded the Photographic Fine Art Association, and he was its chairman. Their definition of Fine Art was “Creating images that evoke emotion by a photographic process in which one's mind and imagination are freely but competently exercised.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jouhar |first=Sultan |date=October 1964 |title=The Work of Dr. Jouhar |url=https://archive.rps.org/archive/volume-104/742322 |journal=The Royal Photographic Society Journal |volume=104 |issue=10 |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the World Wide Web===
Among the definitions that can be found on the [[World Wide Web]] are:
* The [[Library of Congress]] [[Library of Congress Subject Headings|Subject Headings]] use "art photography" as "photography of art," and "artistic photography" (i.e., "Photography, artistic") as "photography as a fine art, including aesthetic theory".&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. [http://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First Authority headings search.] Retrieved August 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus]] states that "fine art photography" (preferred term) or "art photography" or "artistic photography" is "the movement in England and the United States, from around 1890 into the early 20th century, which promoted various aesthetic approaches. Historically, has sometimes been applied to any photography whose intention is aesthetic, as distinguished from scientific, commercial, or journalistic; for this meaning, use 'photography'".&lt;ref&gt;Getty Research Institute.

* Definitions of "fine art photography" on photographers' static Web pages vary from "the subset of fine art that is created with a camera"&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Stephen G. [http://www.sgbphotography.com/articles/What_Is_Fine_Art_Photography.aspx What Is Fine Art Photography?] Retrieved August 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; to "limited-reproduction photography, using materials and techniques that will outlive the artist".&lt;ref&gt;Steinman, Jan.

==History==
[[File:Aktikompositsioon 19 (J. Künnap).jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[nudity]] has been one of the dominating themes in fine-art photography. ''Nude composition 19'' from 1988 by [[Jaan Künnap]].]]
One photography historian claimed that "the earliest exponent of 'Fine Art' or composition photography was [[John Jabez Edwin Mayall|John Edwin Mayall]], "who exhibited [[daguerrotype]]s illustrating the [[Lord's Prayer]] in 1851".&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, Helmut. ''Creative photography: aesthetic trends 1839-1960''. New York: Dover, 1991. {{ISBN|0-486-26750-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Successful attempts to make fine art photography can be traced to [[Victorian era]] practitioners such as [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], [[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson]], and [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]] and others.  In the U.S. [[F. Holland Day]], [[Alfred Stieglitz]] and [[Edward Steichen]] were instrumental in making photography a fine art, and Stieglitz was especially notable in introducing it into museum collections.

In the UK as recently as 1960, photography was not really recognised as a Fine Art. Dr [[S.D.Jouhar]] said, when he formed the Photographic Fine Art Association at that time  - ''"At the moment photography is not generally recognized as anything more than a craft. In the USA photography has been openly accepted as Fine Art in certain official quarters. It is shown in galleries and exhibitions as an Art. There is not corresponding recognition in this country. The London Salon shows pictorial photography, but it is not generally understood as an art. Whether a work shows aesthetic qualities or not it is designated 'Pictorial Photography' which is a very ambiguous term. The photographer himself must have confidence in his work and in its dignity and aesthetic value, to force recognition as an Art rather than a Craft"''

Until the late 1970s several genres predominated, such as nudes, portraits, and natural landscapes (exemplified by [[Ansel Adams]]). Breakthrough 'star' artists in the 1970s and 80s, such as [[Sally Mann]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Robert Farber (photographer)|Robert Farber]] and [[Cindy Sherman]], still relied heavily on such [[genre]]s, although seeing them with fresh eyes. Others investigated a [[snapshot aesthetic]] approach.

American organizations, such as the [[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture Foundation]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]], have done much to keep photography at the forefront of the fine arts. MOMA's establishment of a department of photography in 1940 and appointment of [[Beaumont Newhall]] as its first curator are often cited as institutional confirmation of photography's status as an art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=Christopher |title=The Judgment Seat of Photography |journal=October |date=Autumn 1982 |volume=22 |doi=10.2307/778362 |jstor=778362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Framing and print size==
Until the mid-1950s it was widely considered vulgar and pretentious to frame a photograph for a gallery exhibition. Prints were usually simply pasted onto blockboard or plywood, or given a white border in the darkroom and then pinned at the corners onto display boards. Prints were thus shown without any glass reflections obscuring them.  Steichen's famous [[The Family of Man]] exhibition was unframed, the pictures pasted to panels. Even as late as 1966 [[Bill Brandt]]'s MoMA show was unframed, with simple prints pasted to thin plywood. From the mid-1950s to about 2000 most gallery exhibitions had prints behind glass. Since about 2000 there has been a noticeable move toward once again showing contemporary gallery prints on boards and without glass. In addition, throughout the twentieth century, there was a noticeable increase in the size of prints.

==Politics==
Fine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist’s vision, but as a byproduct it has also been important in advancing certain causes. The work of [[Ansel Adams]] in [[Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone]] provides an example. Adams is one of the most widely recognized fine art photographers of the 20th century, and was an avid promoter of conservation. While his primary focus was on photography as art, some of his work raised public awareness of the beauty of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and helped to build political support for their protection.

Such photography has also had effects in the area of censorship law and free expression, due to its concern with the nude body.

==Current trends==
[[File:Gursky Shanghai.jpg|thumb|left|Andreas Gursky, ''Shanghai'', 2000, C-print mounted to plexiglass, 119 x 81 inches]]
There is now a trend toward a careful staging and lighting of the picture, rather than hoping to "discover" it ready-made.  Photographers such as [[Gregory Crewdson]], and [[Jeff Wall]] are noted for the quality of their [[Tableaux Vivant|staged]] pictures.  Additionally, new technological trends in digital photography have opened a new direction in [[full spectrum photography]], where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet, visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions.

As printing technologies have improved since around 1980, a photographer's art prints reproduced in a finely-printed limited-edition book have now become an area of strong interest to collectors.  This is because books usually have high production values, a short print run, and their limited market means they are almost never reprinted. The collector's market in photography books by individual photographers is developing rapidly.

According to [http://press.artprice.com/pdf/Trends2004.pdf ''Art Market Trends 2004''] (PDF link) 7,000 photographs were sold in auction rooms in 2004, and photographs averaged a 7.6 [[percent]] annual price rise from 1994 and 2004.{{Failed verification|date=October 2008}} Around 80 percent were sold in the United States. Of course, auction sales only record a fraction of total private sales. There is now a thriving collectors' market for which the most sought-after art photographers will produce high quality archival prints in strictly limited editions. Attempts by online art retailers to sell fine photography to the general public alongside prints of paintings have had mixed results, with strong sales coming only from the traditional "big names" of photography such as Ansel Adams.

In addition to the "digital movement" towards manipulation, filtering, or resolution changes, some fine artists deliberately seek a "naturalistic," including "natural lighting" as a value in itself. Sometimes the art work as in the case of [[Gerhard Richter]] consists of a photographic image that has been subsequently painted over with oil paints and/or contains some political or historical significance beyond the image itself. The existence of "photographically-projected painting" now blurs the line between painting and photography which traditionally was absolute.

==Overlap with other genres==
Although fine art photography may overlap with many other genres of photography, the overlaps with [[fashion photography]] and [[photojournalism]] merit special attention.

In 1996 it was stated that there had been a "recent blurring of lines between commercial illustrative photography and fine art photography," especially in the area of fashion.&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;Bryant, Eric. Review of ''Fashion: Photography in the Nineties''. ''Library Journal'', February 15, 1997, p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the overlap of fine art photography and fashion photography includes lectures,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/catherine-atherton-the-fine-art-of-fashion-photography-673645.html Catherine Atherton: The fine art of fashion photography.

Photojournalism and fine art photography overlapped beginning in the "late 1960s and 1970s, when... news photographers struck up liaisons with art photography and painting".&lt;ref name=Goldberg&gt;Goldberg, Vicki. Picture this - magazine photography, in just a few decades, has changed the way life itself is regarded.  ''Life'' magazine, April 15, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974 the [[International Center of Photography]] opened, with emphases on both "humanitarian photojournalism" and "art photography".&lt;ref name=Goldberg/&gt;  By 1987, "pictures that were taken on assignments for magazines and newspapers now regularly reappear[ed] - in frames - on the walls of museums and galleries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Grundberg |first=Andy |date=April 12, 1987 |title=Art; photojournalism lays claim to the realm of esthetics |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D9133EF931A25757C0A961948260 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=August 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New smartphone apps such as [[Snapchat]] sometimes are used for fine-art photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stevegiovinco.com/while-i-watch-my-father-die-photography-exhibition-on-snapchat-explores-memory-emotional-vanishing/|title=While I Watch My Father Die: Photography Exhibition on Snapchat Explores Memory, Emotional Vanishing {{!}} Fine Art Photography, Commissions, NYC Teaching Tutorials Steve Giovinco|website=stevegiovinco.com|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes of artists in other fields==
The reactions of artists and writers have contributed significantly to perceptions of photography as fine art. Prominent painters, such as [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], have asserted their interest in the medium:

{{quote|I have discovered photography. Now I can kill myself. I have nothing else to learn.|Pablo Picasso}}

{{quote|I have always been very interested in photography. I have looked at far more photographs than I have paintings. Because their reality is stronger than reality itself.|Francis Bacon.}}

Noted authors, similarly, have responded to the artistic potential of photography:

{{quote|...it does seem to me that [[Robert Capa|Capa]] has proved beyond all doubt that the camera need not be a cold mechanical device. Like the pen, it is as good as the man who uses it. It can be the extension of mind and heart...|[[John Steinbeck]]}}

{{History of art sidebar}}

The '''history of painting''' reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic humans, and spans all cultures. It represents a continuous, though periodically disrupted, tradition from Antiquity. Across cultures, and spanning continents and millennia, the history of painting is an ongoing river of creativity, that continues into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ColeGealt1991"&gt;{{cite book| author = Bruce Cole|author2=Adelheid M.

Initially serving utilitarian purpose, followed by imperial, private, civic, and religious patronage, Eastern and Western painting later found audiences in the [[aristocracy]] and the middle class. From the Modern era, the [[Middle Ages]] through the [[Renaissance]] painters worked for the church and a wealthy aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rr17bb/patronage.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:52:16 Discussion of the role of patrons in the Renaissance].

==Pre-history==
{{Main|Prehistoric art|Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Art of the Middle Paleolithic|List of Stone Age art}}

The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old. José Luis Sanchidrián at the [[University of Córdoba (Spain)|University of Cordoba]], Spain, believes the paintings are more likely to have been painted by [[Neanderthals]] than early modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21458-first-neanderthal-cave-paintings-discovered-in-spain.html|title=First Neanderthal cave paintings discovered in Spain |author=Fergal MacErlean|date=10 February 2012|accessdate=10 February 2012|work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18449711 Jonathan Amos, ''Red dot becomes oldest cave art'', BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5883082/this-is-the-first-painting-humanity-ever-made Gizmodo, ''These Are the Earliest Human Paintings Ever'']&lt;/ref&gt; Images at the [[Chauvet cave]] in France are thought to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth or humans often hunting. There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc.

Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the people that made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to "catch" their [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily or the paintings may represent an [[animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]]. They may be the result of a basic need of expression that is [[innate]] to human beings, or they could have been for the transmission of practical information.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[Paleolithic]] times, the representation of humans in cave paintings was rare. Mostly, animals were painted, not only animals that were used as food but also animals that represented strength like the [[rhinoceros]] or large [[Felidae]], as in the Chauvet Cave. Signs like dots were sometimes drawn. Rare human representations include handprints and stencils, and figures depicting [[therianthrope|human / animal]] hybrids. The Chauvet Cave in the [[Ardèche]] [[Departments of France]] contains the most important preserved cave paintings of the Paleolithic era, painted around 31,000 BC. The [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]] cave paintings in Spain were done 14,000 to 12,000 BC and show, among others, [[bison]]s. The hall of bulls in [[Lascaux]], Dordogne, France, is one of the best known cave paintings and dates to about 15,000 to 10,000 BC.

If there is meaning to the paintings, it remains unknown. The caves were not in an inhabited area, so they may have been used for seasonal rituals. The animals are accompanied by signs which suggest a possible magic use. Arrow-like symbols in Lascaux are sometimes interpreted as being used as [[calendar]]s or [[almanac]]s, but the evidence remains inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hoover, "Art of the Paleolithic and Neolithic Eras", from ''Art History Survey 1'', San Antonio College (July 2001; accessed 11 June 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The most important work of the [[Mesolithic]] era were the ''marching warriors'', a rock painting at Cingle de la Mola, [[Province of Castellón|Castellón]], Spain dated to about 7000 to 4000 BC. The technique used was probably spitting or blowing the pigments onto the rock. The paintings are quite naturalistic, though stylized. The figures are not three-dimensional, even though they overlap

The earliest known Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings. The colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.

The history of Eastern painting includes a vast range of influences from various cultures and religions.

[[Chinese painting]] is one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world. The earliest paintings were not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals. It was only during the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 B.C.) that artists began to represent the world around them. [[Japanese painting]] is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. The history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy.

China, Japan and Korea have a strong tradition in painting which is also highly attached to the art of [[calligraphy]] and [[printmaking]] (so much that it is commonly seen as painting). Far east traditional painting is characterized by water based techniques, less realism, "elegant" and stylized subjects, graphical approach to depiction, the importance of [[white space (visual arts)|white space]] (or [[negative space]]) and a preference for [[landscape]] (instead of the human figure) as a subject. Beyond ink and color on silk or paper scrolls, gold on [[lacquer]] was also a common medium in painted East Asian artwork. Although silk was a somewhat expensive medium to paint upon in the past, the invention of paper during the 1st century AD by the Han court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] provided not only a cheap and widespread medium for writing, but also a cheap and widespread medium for painting (making it more accessible to the public).

The ideologies of [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], and [[Buddhism]] played important roles in East Asian art. Medieval [[Song dynasty]] painters such as [[Lin Tinggui]] and his ''Luohan Laundering''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=1691|title=Open F-S: Sketch after Cecil Lawson's Swan and Iris|website=Freer - Sackler|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611100744/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=1691|archivedate=11 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (housed in the [[Smithsonian]] [[Freer Gallery of Art]]) of the 12th century are excellent examples of Buddhist ideas fused into classical Chinese artwork. In the latter painting on silk (image and description provided in the link), bald-headed Buddhist [[Arhat|Luohan]] are depicted in a practical setting of washing clothes by a river. However, the painting itself is visually stunning, with the Luohan portrayed in rich detail and bright, opaque colors in contrast to a hazy, brown, and bland wooded environment. Also, the tree tops are shrouded in swirling fog, providing the common "negative space" mentioned above in East Asian Art.

[[Image:Ch'iu Ying 001.jpg|left|thumb|''Spring Morning in the Han Palace'', by Ming-era artist [[Qiu Ying]] (1494–1552 AD)]]

The earliest surviving examples of Chinese painted artwork date to the [[Warring States]] Period (481 – 221 BC), with paintings on silk or tomb murals on rock, brick, or stone. They were often in simplistic stylized format and in more-or-less rudimentary geometric patterns. They often depicted mythological creatures, domestic scenes, labor scenes, or palatial scenes filled with officials at court. Artwork during this period and the subsequent [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 – 207 BC) and [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD) was made not as a means in and of itself or for higher personal expression; rather artwork was created to symbolize and honor funerary rites, representations of mythological deities or spirits of ancestors, etc. Paintings on silk of court officials and domestic scenes could be found during the Han Dynasty, along with scenes of men hunting on horseback or partaking in military parade. There was also painting on three dimensional works of art like figurines and statues, such as the original-painted colors covering the soldier and horse statues of the [[Terracotta Army]]. During the social and cultural climate of the ancient [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] (316 – 420 AD) based at Nanjing in the south, painting became one of the official pastimes of [[Confucian]]-taught bureaucratic officials and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] (along with music played by the [[guqin]] zither, writing fanciful [[calligraphy]], and writing and reciting of poetry). Painting became a common form of artistic self-expression, and during this period painters at court or amongst elite social circuits were judged and ranked by their peers.

[[Image:Zhang Shengwen. L'enseignement de Bouddha Sakyamuni.jpg|thumb|''The [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni Buddha]]'', by [[Zhang Shengwen]], 1173–1176 AD, [[Song dynasty]] period.]]
The establishment of classical Chinese landscape painting is accredited largely to the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] artist [[Gu Kaizhi]] (344 – 406 AD), one of the most famous artists of Chinese history. Like the elongated scroll scenes of Kaizhi, [[Tang dynasty]] (618 – 907 AD) Chinese artists like [[Wu Daozi]] painted vivid and highly detailed artwork on long horizontal handscrolls (which were very popular during the Tang), such as his ''Eighty Seven Celestial People''. Painted artwork during the Tang period pertained the effects of an idealized landscape environment, with sparse numbers of objects, persons, or amount of activity, as well as monochromatic in nature (example: the murals of Price Yide's tomb in the Qianling Mausoleum). There were also figures such as early Tang-era painter [[Zhan Ziqian]], who painted superb landscape paintings that were well ahead of his day in portrayal of realism. However, landscape art did not reach greater level of maturity and realism in general until the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period (907 – 960 AD). During this time, there were exceptional landscape painters like [[Dong Yuan]] (refer to this article for an example of his artwork), and those who painted more vivid and realistic depictions of domestic scenes, like [[Gu Hongzhong]] and his ''Night Revels of Han Xizai''.
[[Image:Loquats and Mountain Bird.jpg|thumb|left|''Loquats and Mountain Bird'', anonymous artist of the [[Southern Song dynasty]]; paintings in leaf album style such as this were popular in the Southern Song (1127–1279).]]

During the Chinese [[Song dynasty]] (960 – 1279 AD), not only landscape art was improved upon, but portrait painting became more standardized and sophisticated than before (for example, refer to [[Emperor Huizong of Song]]), and reached its classical age maturity during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368 – 1644 AD). During the late 13th century and first half of the 14th century, Chinese under the [[Mongol]]-controlled [[Yuan Dynasty]] were not allowed to enter higher posts of government (reserved for Mongols or other ethnic groups from Central Asia), and the [[Imperial examination]] was ceased for the time being. Many Confucian-educated Chinese who now lacked profession turned to the arts of painting and theatre instead, as the Yuan period became one of the most vibrant and abundant eras for Chinese artwork. An example of such would be [[Qian Xuan]] (1235–1305 AD), who was an official of the Song dynasty, but out of patriotism, refused to serve the Yuan court and dedicated himself to painting. Examples of superb art from this period include the rich and detailed painted murals of the Yongle Palace ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405094841/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |archivedate=5 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=245&amp;c=55|title=Chinastudies - bacheloropleiding - Geesteswetenschappen - Humanities - Universiteit Leiden|website=www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Dachunyang Longevity Palace", of 1262 AD, a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage site. Within the palace, paintings cover an area of more than 1000 square meters, and hold mostly Daoist themes. It was during the Song dynasty that painters would also gather in social clubs or meetings to discuss their art or others' artwork, the praising of which often led to persuasions to trade and sell precious works of art. However, there were also many harsh critics of others art as well, showing the difference in style and taste amongst different painters. In 1088 AD, the polymath scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] once wrote of the artwork of one [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]], who he criticized as follows:

{{quote|
...Then there was Li Cheng, who when he depicted [[pavilion]]s and lodges amidst mountains, storeyed buildings, [[pagoda]]s and the like, always used to paint the [[eave]]s as seen from below. His idea was that 'one should look upwards from underneath, just as a man standing on level ground and looking up at the eaves of a pagoda can see its rafters and its cantilever eave rafters'. This is all wrong. In general the proper way of painting a landscape is to see the small from the viewpoint of the large...just as one looks at artificial mountains in gardens (as one walks about). If one applies (Li's method) to the painting of real mountains, looking up at them from below, one can only see one profile at a time, and not the wealth of their multitudinous slopes and profiles, to say nothing of all that is going on in the valleys and [[canyon]]s, and in the lanes and [[courtyard]]s with their dwellings and houses. If we stand to the east of a mountain its western parts would be on the vanishing boundary of far-off distance, and vice versa. Surely this could not be called a successful painting? Mr. Li did not understand the principle of 'seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large'. He was certainly marvelous at diminishing accurately heights and distances, but should one attach such importance to the angles and corners of buildings?&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986).

Although high level of stylization, mystical appeal, and surreal elegance were often preferred over realism (such as in [[shan shui]] style), beginning with the medieval Song dynasty there were many Chinese painters then and afterwards who depicted scenes of nature that were vividly real. Later Ming Dynasty artists would take after this Song dynasty emphasis for intricate detail and realism on objects in nature, especially in depictions of animals (such as ducks, swans, sparrows, tigers, etc.) amongst patches of brightly colored flowers and thickets of brush and wood (a good example would be the anonymous Ming Dynasty painting ''Birds and Plum Blossoms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704090030/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-07-04|title=Request Rejected|website=www.asia.si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; housed in the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.). There were many renowned Ming Dynasty artists; [[Qiu Ying]] is an excellent example of a paramount Ming era painter (famous even in his own day), utilizing in his artwork domestic scenes, bustling palatial scenes, and nature scenes of river valleys and steeped mountains shrouded in mist and swirling clouds. During the Ming Dynasty there were also different and rivaling schools of art associated with painting, such as the [[Wu School]] and the [[Zhe school (painting)|Zhe School]].

Classical Chinese painting continued on into the early modern [[Qing Dynasty]], with highly realistic portrait paintings like seen in the late Ming Dynasty of the early 17th century. The portraits of [[Kangxi Emperor]], [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and [[Qianlong Emperor]] are excellent examples of realistic Chinese portrait painting. During the Qianlong reign period and the continuing 19th century, European [[Baroque]] styles of painting had noticeable influence on Chinese portrait paintings, especially with painted visual effects of lighting and shading. Likewise, East Asian paintings and other works of art (such as [[porcelain]] and lacquerware) were highly prized in Europe since initial contact in the 16th century.

====Japanese ====
{{main|Japanese painting|Japonism}}

Japanese painting (絵画) is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the Japanese arts, encompassing a wide variety of genres and styles. As with Japanese arts in general, Japanese painting developed through a long history of synthesis and competition between native Japanese [[aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. [[Ukiyo-e]], or "pictures of the floating world," is a genre of Japanese [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] (or "[[woodcut]]s") and paintings produced between the 17th and 20th centuries, featuring motifs of landscapes, theater, and courtesan districts. It is the main artistic genre of [[woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese woodblock printing]]. Japanese printmaking, especially from the [[Edo period]], exerted enormous influence on [[French painting]] over the 19th century.

====Korean ====
{{main|Korean painting}}

Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy. It wasn't until the [[Joseon dynasty]] that Confucian themes began to take root in Korean paintings, used in harmony with indigenous aspects.

The history of Korean painting has been characterized by the use monochromatic works of black brushwork, often on mulberry paper or silk. This style is evident in "Min-Hwa", or colorful folk art, tomb paintings, and ritual and festival arts, both of which incorporated an extensive use of colour.

Indian paintings historically revolved around the religious deities and kings. Indian art is a collective term for several different schools of art that existed in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The paintings varied from large frescoes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] to the intricate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniature paintings to the metal embellished works from the [[Tanjore]] school. The paintings from the [[Gandhar(city/kingdom)|Gandhar]]–[[Taxila]] are influenced by the [[Persian art|Persian]] works in the west. The eastern style of painting was mostly developed around the [[Nalanda]] school of art. The works are mostly inspired by various scenes from [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]].

The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.

=====Rajput =====
[[Rajput painting]], a style of [[Indian painting]], evolved and flourished, during the 18th century, in the royal courts of [[Rajputana]], India. Each Rajput kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans. Miniatures were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but several manuscripts also contain Rajput paintings, and paintings were even done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelies, particularly, the havelis of Shekhawait.

The colors extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones, gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colors was a lengthy process, sometimes taking weeks. Brushes used were very fine.

[[Mughal painting]] is a particular style of [[Indian painting]], generally confined to illustrations on the book and done in miniatures, and which emerged, developed and took shape during the period of the [[Mughal Empire]] 16th −19th centuries.

=====Tanjore =====
[[Tanjore painting]] is an important form of classical [[South India]]n painting native to the town of [[Tanjore]] in Tamil Nadu. The art form dates back to the early 9th century, a period dominated by the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] rulers, who encouraged art and literature. These paintings are known for their elegance, rich colors, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.

The process of making a Tanjore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of a cloth pasted over a wooden base. Then chalk powder or [[zinc oxide]] is mixed with water-soluble [[adhesive]] and applied on the base. To make the base smoother, a mild [[abrasive]] is sometimes used. After the drawing is made, decoration of the jewellery and the apparels in the image is done with semi-precious stones. Laces or threads are also used to decorate the jewellery. On top of this, the gold foils are pasted. Finally, [[dyes]] are used to add colors to the figures in the paintings.

=====Madras School=====
During British rule in India, the crown found that Madras had some of the most talented and intellectual artistic minds in the world. As the British had also established a huge settlement in and around Madras, Georgetown was chosen to establish an institute that would cater to the artistic expectations of the royal family in London. This has come to be known as the [[Madras School]]. At first traditional artists were employed to produce exquisite varieties of furniture, metal work, and curios and their work was sent to the royal palaces of the Queen.

Unlike the Bengal School where 'copying' is the norm of teaching, the Madras School flourishes on 'creating' new styles, arguments and trends.

=====Bengal School=====
{{main|Bengal school of art}}

[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871–1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The [[Bengal school of art]] was an influential style of art that flourished in [[British India|India]] during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. It was associated with Indian nationalism, but was also promoted and supported by many British arts administrators.

The Bengal School arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by [[Indian artist]]s such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianist]] model of art.

The Bengal School's influence in India declined with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas in the 1920s. In the post-independence period, Indian artists showed more adaptability as they borrowed freely from european styles and amalgamated them freely with the Indian motifs to new forms of art. While artists like [[Francis Newton Souza]] and [[Tyeb Mehta]] were more western in their approach, there were others like [[Ganesh Pyne]] and [[Maqbool Fida Husain]] who developed thoroughly indigenous styles of work. Today after the process of liberalization of market in India, the artists are experiencing more exposure to the international art-scene which is helping them in emerging with newer forms of art which were hitherto not seen in India. [[Jitish Kallat]] had shot to fame in the late 1990s with his paintings which were both modern and beyond the scope of generic definition. However, while artists in India in the new century are trying out new styles, themes and metaphors, it would not have been possible to get such quick recognition without the aid of the business houses which are now entering the art field like they had never before.

[[Amrita Sher-Gil]] was an Indian painter, sometimes known as India's [[Frida Kahlo]],&lt;ref name="AmritaMaps"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/who-is-who/art-culture/amrita-sher-gill.html |title=Amrita Sher-Gill |publisher= mapsofindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today considered an important woman painter of 20th-century India, whose legacy stands at par with that of the Masters of [[Bengal Renaissance]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19991017/iex17018.html |title=First Lady of the Modern Canvas |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |date=17 October 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305222544/http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19991017/iex17018.html |archivedate=5 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indiawomenpainters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.21stcenturyindianart.com/women.htm |title=Women painters |publisher=21stcenturyindianart.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220174924/http://www.21stcenturyindianart.com/women.htm |archivedate=20 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; she is also the 'most expensive' woman painter of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.rediff.com/money/2007/dec/29art.htm |title=Most expensive Indian artists |publisher=us.rediff.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, she is amongst ''Nine Masters'', whose work was declared as ''art treasures'' by The [[Archaeological Survey of India]], in 1976 and 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chdmuseum.nic.in/art_gallery/nine_masters.html |title=Nine Masters |publisher=[[Government Museum and Art Gallery, Chandigarh]] Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204055532/http://chdmuseum.nic.in/art_gallery/nine_masters.html |archivedate=4 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 100 of her paintings are now displayed at [[National Gallery of Modern Art]], New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-amrita.asp |title= Showcase: Amrita Sher-Gil |publisher=National Gallery of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial era, Western influences started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes. Others, like [[Jamini Roy]], consciously drew inspiration from folk art.

By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.

The [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. The founders were six eminent artists – [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza|F. N. Souza]], though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, [[Manishi Dey]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde|V. S. Gaitonde]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], and [[Akbar Padamsee]]. Other famous painters like [[Jahar Dasgupta]], Prokash Karmakar, [[John Wilkins (Indian artist)|John Wilkins]], Narayanan Ramachandran, and Bijon Choudhuri enriched the art culture of India. They have become the icons of modern Indian art. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Geeta Vadhera has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta.

Indian art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since the early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. In post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the abstract painter [[Natvar Bhavsar]], figurative artist [[Devajyoti Ray]] and sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] whose mammoth [[postminimalist]] artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size. Many art houses and galleries have also opened in USA and Europe to showcase Indian artworks.

Filipino painting as a whole can be seen as an amalgamation of many cultural influences, though it tends to be more Western in its current form with Eastern roots.

Early Filipino painting can be found in red slip (clay mixed with water) designs embellished on the ritual pottery of the Philippines such as the acclaimed [[Manunggul Jar]]. Evidence of Philippine pottery-making dated as early as 6000{{nbsp}}BC has been found in Sanga-sanga Cave, Sulu and Laurente Cave, Cagayan. It has been proven that by 5000{{nbsp}}BC, the making of pottery was practiced throughout the country. Early Filipinos started making pottery before their Cambodian neighbors and at about the same time as the Thais as part of what appears to be a widespread Ice Age development of pottery technology. Further evidences of painting are manifested in the [[History of tattooing#Philippines|tattoo tradition]] of early Filipinos, whom the Portuguese explorer referred to as ''Pintados'' or the 'Painted People' of the Visayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |title=Islas de los Pintados: The Visayan Islands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927161432/http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various designs referencing flora and fauna with heavenly bodies decorate their bodies in various colored pigmentation. Perhaps, some of the most elaborate painting done by early Filipinos that survive to the present day can be manifested among the arts and architecture of the [[Maranao]] who are well known for the [[Nāga]] Dragons and the [[Sarimanok]] carved and painted in the beautiful Panolong of their Torogan or King's House.

Filipinos began creating paintings in the European tradition during the 17th-century Spanish period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filipinocultured.blogspot.com/2007/09/best-of-filipino-art-part-1.html |title=Filipino Cultured: The Best of Filipino Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest of these paintings were Church frescoes, religious imagery from Biblical sources, as well as engravings, sculptures and lithographs featuring Christian icons and European nobility. Most of the paintings and sculptures between the 19th, and 20th century produced a mixture of religious, political, and landscape art works, with qualities of sweetness, dark, and light. Early [[modern art|modernist]] painters such as [[Damián Domingo]] was associated with religious and secular paintings. The art of [[Juan Luna]] and [[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo|Félix Hidalgo]] showed a trend for political statement. Artist such as [[Fernando Amorsolo]] used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated Philippine culture, nature, and harmony. While other artists such as [[Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo|Fernando Zóbel]] used realities and [[abstract art|abstract]] on his work.

[[Ancient Egypt]], a civilization with very strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colours) also had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]]s. Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language – called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today. Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the deceased to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.

To the north of [[Egypt]] was the [[Minoan civilization]] centered on the island of [[Crete]]. The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to that of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style. [[Mycenaean Greece]], beginning around 1600 BC, produced similar art to that of Minoan Crete. [[Ancient Greek art]] during the [[Greek Dark Age]] became far less complex, but the renewal of Greek civilization [[Colonies in antiquity|throughout the Mediterranean]] during [[Archaic Greece]] brought about new forms of Greek art with the [[Orientalizing period|Orientalizing style]].

[[File:Hades and Persephone, Vergina.jpg|thumb|400px|A fresco showing [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]] riding in a [[chariot]], from the tomb of Queen [[Eurydice I of Macedon]] at [[Vergina]], Greece, 4th century BC]]
[[Ancient Greece]] had skilled painters, sculptors (though both endeavours were regarded as mere manual labour at the time), and architects. The [[Parthenon]] is an example of their architecture that has lasted to modern days. Greek marble sculpture is often described as the highest form of [[classicism|Classical]] art. Painting on [[pottery of Ancient Greece]] and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in Ancient Greece functioned. [[Black-figure vase painting]] and [[Red-figure vase painting]] gives many surviving examples of what Greek painting was. Some famous Greek painters on wooden panels who are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]], however no examples of Ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans. Zeuxis lived in 5–6{{nbsp}}BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes. Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and [[fresco]]es, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy at sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the Ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]]. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

The rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. [[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.
Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.
[[Image:Hastings book of the hours.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book of Hours]]]]
In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and "barbarian" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.

Walls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.

Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as International style and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gained importance.

The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, heralded the study of classical sources, as well as advances in science which profoundly influenced European intellectual and artistic life. In the [[Low Countries]], especially in modern day [[Flanders]], a new way of painting was established in the beginning of the 15th century. In the footsteps of the developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al"&gt;Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., &amp; Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430-437&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose invention was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]], but painters like Jan van Eyck and [[Robert Campin]] brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism they were aiming for. With this new medium the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of Ancient Greece and Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism). The most important artist of this time was [[Jan van Eyck]], whose work ranks among the finest made by artists who are now known as [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painters]] or [[Flemish Primitives]] (since most artists were active in cities in modern day Flanders). The first painter of this period was [[the Master of Flémalle]], nowadays identified as [[Robert Campin]], whose work follows the art of the [[International Gothic]]. Another important painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists from this period are [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].

In Italy, the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. Artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Masaccio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.

Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the Renaissance such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] represent a different approach from their Italian colleagues, one that is more realistic and less idealized. [[Genre painting]] became a popular idiom amongst the Northern painters like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]].

Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]]. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.

The [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].

Baroque painting is associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]], a movement often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]] and the [[Counter Reformation]] or Catholic Revival;&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows. Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. During the period beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century, painting is characterized as Baroque. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Caravaggio]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], and [[Johannes Vermeer]]. Caravaggio is an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.
Baroque painting often dramatizes scenes using light effects; this can be seen in works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, [[Le Nain]], [[Georges de La Tour|La Tour]], and [[Jusepe de Ribera]].

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Portret van een paar als oudtestamentische figuren, genaamd 'Het Joodse bruidje' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Jewish Bride'', ca.&amp;nbsp;1665–1669]]
In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky. A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.

During the 18th century, [[Rococo]] followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.

[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]].

After [[Rococo]] there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe [[neo-classicism]], best represented by such artists as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] and his heir [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].
This movement turned its attention toward landscape and nature as well as the human figure and the supremacy of natural order above mankind's will. There is a [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophy (see [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]) within this conception that opposes [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals by seeing mankind's destiny in a more tragic or pessimistic light. The idea that human beings are not above the forces of [[Nature]] is in contradiction to [[Ancient Greek]] and Renaissance ideals where mankind was above all things and owned his fate. This thinking led romantic artists to depict the [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublime]], ruined churches, shipwrecks, massacres and madness.

By the mid-19th-century painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. The idea "art for art's sake" began to find expression in the work of painters like Francisco de Goya, John Constable, and J.M.W. Turner. Romantic painters saw [[landscape painting]] as an important genre to express the vanity of mankind in opposition to the grandeur of nature. Until then, landscape painting wasn't considered the most important genre for painters (like portraiture or history painting). But painters like J.M.W. Turner and Caspar David Friedrich managed to elevate landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting.
Some of the major painters of this period are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Théodore Géricault]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[John Constable]]. [[Francisco de Goya]]'s late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, while the work of [[Arnold Böcklin]] evokes mystery and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James McNeill Whistler]] evoke both sophistication and [[decadent movement|decadence]]. In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708024742/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |last=Novack |first=Barbara |title=American Sublime Artforum |year=2002 |accessdate=30 October 2008 |work=ArtForum }}&lt;/ref&gt; exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the [[Hudson River School]].

[[Image:Mary Cassatt Young Mother Sewing.jpg|thumb|left|''Young Mother Sewing'', [[Mary Cassatt]]]]The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]] painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as does the paintings of [[Eugène Boudin]] who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors. Boudin was also an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[Plein air]] painting. A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]]. In the latter third of the century Impressionists like [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic pallette. Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].
[[Image:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]
Pissarro adopted some of the experiments of [[Post-Impressionism]]. Slightly younger Post-Impressionists like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges Seurat]], along with [[Paul Cézanne]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]; for Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism; Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like
compositions; Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.
The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]; and in Australia where painters of the [[Heidelberg School]] such as [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Charles Conder]] painted ''[[en plein air]]'' and were particularly interested in the Australian landscape and light. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms. The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].

In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], and [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustave Klimt]] amongst others including the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] like [[Mikhail Vrubel]].

[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[René Magritte]]'s surrealism as "Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Delvaille| first = Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Delvaille| title = La poésie symboliste: [anthologie]| year = 1971| isbn = 978-2-221-50161-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century modern and contemporary===
{{main|Modern Art|Modernism|Contemporary art}}
The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]].

The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Henri Matisse]]'s second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] 1907, Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[analytic Cubism]] was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'', from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.

Les Fauves (French for ''The Wild Beasts'') were early-20th-century painters, experimenting with freedom of expression through color. The name was given, humorously and not as a compliment, to the group by art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]]. [[Fauvism]] was a short-lived and loose grouping of early-20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. Fauvists made the subject of the painting easy to read, exaggerated perspectives and an interesting prescient prediction of the Fauves was expressed in 1888 by [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Paul Sérusier]],

''"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]]."''

The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]] — friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers. Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = John Elderfield|author2=Stephen Andrew Roberts| title = European Co-operation on Social Science Information and Documentation (ECSSID) Technical Meeting, University of Kent at Canterbury, 25th-26th March 1991: Report to British Library Research &amp; Development Department| year = 1991| isbn = 978-0-87070-638-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fauvism, as a movement, had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907, they only had three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse ''The Green Line'', (above), caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight; art as a decoration was his purpose and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], [[André Derain]] went to London and produced a series of paintings like ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' (above) in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]]. Masters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement throughout the 20th century.

By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, soon it was replaced by [[Cubism]] on the critics' radar screen as the latest new development in [[Contemporary Art]] of the time.
In 1907 [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in La Falange, said, "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Stanley Rubin |author2=Judith Cousins |author3=Museum of Modern Art New York| title = Picasso and Braque: pioneering cubism| year = 1989| isbn = 0-87070-676-4| page = 348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Analytic cubism]]  was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.

During the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of [[cubism]], several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio De Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade a member of the jury at the Salon d'Automne, where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and Salon d'Automne, his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. During the first half of the 20th century in Europe masters like [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], and [[Giorgio De Chirico]] continued painting independent of any movement.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the first two decades of the 20th century and after [[Cubism]], several other important movements emerged; [[futurism (art)|futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]), [[Der Blaue Reiter]]), [[Bauhaus]], ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) and ([[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]], [[Jean Arp|Arp]]) and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio De Chirico|De Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]], [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]). Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] architecture and design, to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and [[concrete poetry]] to advertising art and fashion. Van Gogh's painting exerted great influence upon 20th-century [[Expressionism]], as can be seen in the work of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], [[Die Brücke]] (a group led by German painter [[Ernst Kirchner]]), and the Expressionism of [[Edvard Munch]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and others..

[[Wassily Kandinsky]] a Russian painter, [[printmaker]] and art theorist, one of the most famous 20th-century artists is generally considered the first important painter of [[Modern Art|modern]] abstract art. As an early Modernist, in search of new modes of visual expression, and spiritual expression, he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the (above gallery) ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art.'' [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His later works were more abstract, reminiscent of [[Paul Klee]]. His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color, and a clear love of experimentation of both depth and tone. At the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay and his wife the artist [[Sonia Delaunay]], joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of abstract artists, in 1911, and his art took a turn to the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 |title=Der Blaue Reiter |publisher= Tate Glossary |accessdate=10 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], who after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, and after pressure from the [[Stalinist]] regime in 1924 returned to painting imagery and ''Peasants and Workers in the field'', and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]] whose masterful color experiments made him an important pioneer of [[abstract painting]] at the [[Bauhaus]]. Still other important pioneers of abstract painting include the Swedish artist [[Hilma af Klint]], Czech painter [[František Kupka]] as well as American artists [[Stanton MacDonald-Wright]] and [[Morgan Russell]] who, in 1912, founded [[Synchromism]], an art movement that closely resembles [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several important and related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the avant-garde art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist artists are related to both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters.

Artists as interesting and diverse as [[Marc Chagall]], whose painting ''[[I and the Village]]'', (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Käthe Schmidt Kollwitz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and some of the Americans abroad like [[Marsden Hartley]], and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as an intense [[Surrealist]] sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Piet Mondrian]]'s art was also related to his spiritual and philosophical studies. In 1908 he became interested in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] movement launched by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. Blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a knowledge of nature more profound than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondrian's work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge.

[[File:Cosmic Synchrony.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Morgan Russell]], ''Cosmic Synchromy'' (1913-14), [[Synchromism]]]]
[[De Stijl]] also known as [[neoplasticism]], was a Dutch artistic movement founded in 1917. The term ''[[De Stijl]]'' is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=82|title=De Stijl|accessdate=31 July 2006|work=Tate Glossary|publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book| last = Curl| first = James Stevens| title = A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture| type = Paperback| edition = Second| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 0-19-860678-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''De Stijl'' is also the name of a journal that was published by the Dutch painter, designer, writer, and critic [[Theo van Doesburg]] propagating the group's theories. Next to van Doesburg, the group's principal members were the painters [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Vilmos Huszár]], and [[Bart van der Leck]], and the architects [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff]], and [[J. J. P. Oud]]. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as ''neoplasticism'' — the new plastic art (or ''Nieuwe Beelding'' in Dutch).

Proponents of De Stijl sought to express a new [[utopia]]n ideal of spiritual harmony and order. They advocated pure [[abstract art|abstraction]] and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to the vertical and horizontal directions, and used only [[primary colors]] along with black and white. Indeed, according to the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online article on neoplasticism, Mondrian himself sets forth these delimitations in his essay "Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art". He writes, "...&amp;nbsp;this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour." The Tate article further summarizes that this art allows "only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=191 |title=Neo-Plasticism |publisher=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article on De Stijl summarizes these traits in similar terms: "It [De Stijl] was posited on the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |title=The style; Holland, 1917 |publisher=guggenheimcollection.org |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821042905/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Stijl movement was influenced by [[Cubist]] painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about "ideal" geometric forms (such as the "perfect straight line") in the [[neoplatonic]] philosophy of [[mathematician]] [[M. H. J. Schoenmaekers]]. The works of De Stijl would influence the [[Bauhaus]] style and the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an "ism" (Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like Bauhaus; it was a collective project, a joint enterprise.

[[Marcel Duchamp]], came to international prominence in the wake of his notorious success at the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913, (soon after he denounced artmaking for [[chess]]). After Duchamp's [[Nude Descending a Staircase]] became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''[[Large Glass]]'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zurich]], Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several [[Dadaists]] are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]].'' The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the [[Dada]] movement through 1919 in [[Zurich]] and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. [[Joan Miró]]'s ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' of 1923–1924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Miró's first Surrealist masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved on 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Miró's ''The Tilled Field'' also contains several parallels to Bosch's ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights|Garden of Earthly Delights]]'': similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Miró saw as a young painter in [[The Prado]]. The more abstract [[Joan Miró]], [[Jean Arp]], [[André Masson]], and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.
Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works.

Dalí and [[René Magritte|Magritte]] created some of the most widely recognized images of the movement. The 1928/1929 painting ''This Is Not A Pipe'', by [[René Magritte|Magritte]] is the subject of a [[Michel Foucault]] 1973 book, ''This is not a Pipe'' (English edition, 1991), that discusses the painting and its [[paradox]]. Dalí joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.

Surrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth by stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, in order to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, and perception, sometimes evoking empathy from the viewer, sometimes laughter and sometimes outrage and bewilderment.

1931 marked a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: in one example, liquid shapes become the trademark of Dalí, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they are melting. Evocations of time and its compelling mystery and absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79018 |title=The Persistence of Memory |publisher=MoMA Online Collection }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of this style – a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological – came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[Modernism|modernist]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be "made whole with one's individuality."
[[File:Murdering Airplane.jpg|thumb|[[Max Ernst]], 1920, early [[Surrealism]]]]
Max Ernst whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'', studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text |title=Max Ernst (1891–1976). Men Shall Know Nothing of This 1923 / Les Hommes n'en sauront rien |publisher=tate.org.uk |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was enormously influential in helping the newly arrived in Paris and young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in the new [[Surrealist]] painting. Miró acknowledged in letters to his dealer [[Pierre Matisse]] the importance of Masson as an example to him in his early years in Paris.

Long after personal, political and professional tensions have fragmented the Surrealist group into thin air and ether, Magritte, Miró, Dalí and the other Surrealists continue to define a visual program in the arts. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]] among others.

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with [[Die Brücke]] which was founded the previous decade in 1905 and was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members of Die Brücke were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]], [[Otto Mueller]] and others. The group was one of the seminal ones, which in due course had a major impact on the evolution of [[modern art]] in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="bruckemuseumbrucke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm |title=The Artists' Association Brücke |publisher=Brücke Museum |accessdate=7 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]]'', 1909 is in the gallery above, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved.
[[File:Patrick Henry Bruce Stilleben.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[American modernism]], 1924]]

The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. It is also claimed that the name could have derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.

In the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. Artists like [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], created reputations abroad. In New York City, [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock|Ralph Blakelock]] were influential and important figures in advanced American painting between 1900 and 1920. During the 1920s photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] exhibited [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[John Marin]] and other artists including European Masters [[Henri Matisse]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]], at his gallery ''[[the 291]].''

During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, German Expressionism, Expressionism, and [[modernist]] and masterful color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] characterized the European art scene. In Germany [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings, foreshadowing the coming of World War II. While in America [[American Scene painting]] and the [[social realism]] and [[regionalism (art)|regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. In Latin America besides the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]] began a renaissance of the arts for the region, with a use of color and historic, and political messages. [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Symbolist works also relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. The psychological drama in many of Kahlo's self portraits (above) underscore the vitality and relevance of her paintings to artists in the 21st century.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by [[Grant Wood]] from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting, like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, "[[Man at the Crossroads]]", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. The film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' includes a dramatization of the controversy. [[Frida Kahlo]] (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are [[Self portrait|self-portraits]], which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. Christian and Jewish themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition—which were often bloody and violent—with [[surrealist]] renderings. While her paintings are not overtly Christian – she was, after all, an avowed communist – they certainly contain elements of the macabre Mexican Christian style of religious paintings.

Political activism was an important piece of [[David Siqueiros]]' life, and frequently inspired him to set aside his artistic career. His art was deeply rooted in the [[Mexican Revolution]], a violent and chaotic period in Mexican history in which various social and political factions fought for recognition and power. The period from the 1920s to the 1950s is known as the Mexican Renaissance, and Siqueiros was active in the attempt to create an art that was at once Mexican and universal. He briefly gave up painting to focus on organizing miners in Jalisco.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to [[Surrealism]], including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was the scene of the "[[Bombing of Gernika]]" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. The town was devastated, though the Biscayan assembly and the Oak of Gernika survived. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.

In its final form, ''Guernica'' is an immense black and white, {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall and {{convert|7.8|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white contrasts with the intensity of the scene depicted and invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/cubism/Pablo-Picasso.html|title=Pablo Picasso – Biography, Quotes &amp; Paintings |publisher=arthistoryarchive.com |accessdate=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Picasso painted the mural sized painting called ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' in protest of the bombing. The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then [[Scandinavia]], then London in 1938 and finally in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. The painting went on a tour of museums throughout the USA until its final return to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City where it was exhibited for nearly thirty years. Finally in accord with [[Pablo Picasso]]'s wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, through the years of World War II American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]] in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The scene was inspired by a [[diner]] (since demolished) in [[Greenwich Village]], Hopper's home neighborhood in [[Manhattan]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.

The Dynamic for artists in Europe during the 1930s deteriorated rapidly as the Nazi's power in Germany and across Eastern Europe increased. The climate became so hostile for artists and art associated with [[Modernism]] and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] that many left for the Americas. ''[[Degenerate art]]'' was a term adopted by the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany for virtually all [[modern art]]. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was un-German or [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevist]] in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely.

''Degenerate Art'' was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in [[Munich]] in 1937, consisting of modernist artworks chaotically hung and accompanied by text labels deriding the art. Designed to inflame public opinion against modernism, the exhibition subsequently traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria. German artist [[Max Beckmann]] and scores of others fled Europe for New York. In New York City a new generation of young and exciting Modernist painters led by [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], and others were just beginning to come of age.

[[Arshile Gorky]]'s portrait of someone who might be [[Willem de Kooning]] (above) is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

====Towards mid-century====
[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Edward Hopper]] 1942, [[American Scene painting]]]]
The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], Surrealism, [[Joan Miró]], Cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors. The figurative work of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Andrew Wyeth]] and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism.

Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]]. It is seen as combining the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[futurism (art)|futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]] and synthetic cubism. Abstract expressionism, [[action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

====Abstract expressionism====
{{main|Abstract expressionism|Action painting|Color Field painting|Lyrical Abstraction}}
[[File:Blue Poles (Jackson Pollock painting).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Jackson Pollock]], ''[[Blue Poles]],'' 1952, [[National Gallery of Australia]]]]
Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. As seen above in the gallery ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]]'', [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV'', [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1 |title=Willem De Kooning: Woman V 1952–53 |publisher= [[National Gallery of Australia]] |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'', 1950 as with [[Jackson Pollock]] and other Abstract Expressionists, was labelled an "action painter" because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color Field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] (gallery) can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color Field painting.

Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or of the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. An exception might be the drip paintings of Pollock.

Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[Social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]] but also by the [[Socialist Realism|Social Realists]] of Mexico such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of those painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early 1940s at galleries in New York like ''[[The Art of This Century Gallery]]''. The late 1940s through the mid-1950s ushered in the [[McCarthy era]]. It was after World War II and a time of political conservatism and extreme artistic censorship in the United States. Some people have conjectured that since the subject matter was often totally abstract, Abstract expressionism became a safe strategy for artists to pursue this style. Abstract art could be seen as apolitical. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders. However, those theorists are in the minority. As the first truly original school of painting in America, Abstract expressionism demonstrated the vitality and creativity of the country in the post-war years, as well as its ability (or need) to develop an aesthetic sense that was not constrained by the European standards of beauty.

Although Abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the San Francisco Bay area. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of action painting, while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the Color Field painters. Many other artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]], [[Nicolas Carone]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.  

During the 1950s Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s, ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]], – all moving in a new direction. Artists like Clyfford Still, [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. In ''Mountains and Sea'', from 1952, a seminal work of [[Color Field]] painting by [[Helen Frankenthaler]] the artist used the stain technique for the first time.

In Europe there was the continuation of Surrealism, Cubism, Dada and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to Abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Pierre Soulages]] among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.

Eventually abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as [[Neo-Dada]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism]] and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements, notably [[Pop art]].

====Pop art====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
{{main|Pop art}}
Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Alloway| first = Lawrence| title = Topics in American art: since 1945| year = 1975| publisher = W. W. Norton| isbn = 978-0-393-04401-0| pages = 119–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] were considered seminal examples in the movement.

[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s set the table for pop art in America. In New York City during the mid-1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works and the work of [[Larry Rivers]], were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion and the combining of mundane materials into their work. The innovations of Johns' specific use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the American flag; Rivers paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]], and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]] gave rise to a radical new movement in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as pop art.

American pop art is exemplified by artists: [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein's most important work is arguably ''[[Whaam!]]'' (1963, [[Tate Modern]], London&lt;ref name="Tate_Whaam"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts a fighter aircraft firing a rocket into an enemy plane, with a red-and-yellow explosion. The cartoon style is heightened by the use of the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] lettering ''"[[Whaam!]]"'' and the boxed caption ''"I pressed the fire control... and ahead of me rockets blazed through the sky..."''&lt;ref name=Tate_Whaam/&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'' the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. [[Sidney Janis]] mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in the fall of 1962 an historically important and ground-breaking ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' exhibition of pop art, curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] sent shock waves across the Western United States.

While in the downtown scene in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of [[Pop Art]]. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront and made painted objects, and the [[Green Gallery]] on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited other American artists including the bulk of the careers of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and his use of Benday dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and pop artists like [[Alex Katz]] (who became known for his parodies of portrait photography and suburban life), Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.

While throughout the 20th century many painters continued to practice landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, like [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[David Hockney]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Vija Celmins]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

During the 1930s through the 1960s abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction, allowing figurative imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[still-life]] painter [[Giorgio Morandi]], [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], [[Elaine de Kooning]] and others. Along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]], and other 20th-century masters. In particular Milton Avery through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=miltonavery NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; ''Milton Avery &amp;ndash; Onrushing Waves'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, ''Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Head VI]]'', 1949 is a painting by the Irish born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]]. The work shows a distorted version of the [[Portrait of Innocent X]] painted by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Schmied| first = Wieland| title = Francis Bacon: commitment and conflict| year = 1996| publisher = Prestel Pub| isbn = 3-7913-1664-8| page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false [[Fauvism|fauve]] manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Peppiatt| first = Michael| title = เรื่องเก่าเล่าใหม่: รวมข้อคิดจากพงศาวดารและตํานานเก่า| year = 1998| publisher = Westview Press| isbn = 978-0-8133-3520-9| page = 147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied (1996), p20&lt;/ref&gt; The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt (1996), p148&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian painter [[Giorgio Morandi]] was an important 20th-century early pioneer of Minimalism. Born in [[Bologna, Italy]] in 1890, throughout his career, Morandi concentrated almost exclusively on still lives and landscapes, except for a few self-portraits. With great sensitivity to tone, color, and compositional balance, he would depict the same familiar bottles and vases again and again in paintings notable for their simplicity of execution. Morandi executed 133 etchings, a significant body of work in its own right, and his drawings and watercolors often approach abstraction in their economy of means. Through his simple and repetitive motifs and economical use of color, value and surface, Morandi became a prescient and important forerunner of [[Minimalism]]. He died in Bologna in 1964.

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicholas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]] (who was always a figurative artist), and [[Nicolas de Staël|de Staël]], abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël 's work was quickly recognised within the post-war art world, and he became one of the most influential artists of the 1950s. His return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël 's late work – in particular his thinned, and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. [[Nicolas de Staël]]'s bold and intensely vivid color in his last paintings predict the direction of much of contemporary painting that came after him including Pop art of the 1960s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of [[Abstract expressionism]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[outsider art|art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L'Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949] (in English: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[fluxus]], [[neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I, (Landscape No. 1),'' 1963, Oil on canvas, 60 1/4 x 50 1/2 inches, collection: [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]) and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The Bay Area Figurative Movement of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'', 1963 is a typical example were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Although throughout the 20th century painters continued to practice [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and use imagery, practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and others. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[John Baeder]] and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of writers, including [[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], and [[James Schuyler]]. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on [[Great Spruce Head Island, Maine]].

Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the "death of painting". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada is also a movement that started 1n the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. Featuring the emergence of combined manufactured items, with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others were important pioneers of both abstraction and Pop Art; creating new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Color Field painting]] clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Color Field painting is related to [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[suprematism]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]].

During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Color Field]] painting, his work can serve as a bridge between [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, and [[minimal art]]. Two influential teachers [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. [[Josef Albers]] is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both [[hard-edge painting]] and Op art.

[[Josef Albers]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Terry |last=Fenton |title=Online essay about Kenneth Noland, and acrylic paint |url=http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials |accessdate=30 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Al Held]] and some others like [[Mino Argento]],&lt;ref&gt;Noel, Frackman "Mino Argento create. These canvases in which geometric forms, squares, arcs, and lines", Arts Magazine p.19 December 1979&lt;/ref&gt; are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well.

In 1965, an exhibition called ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'', curated by William C. Seitz, was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in New York City. The works shown were wide ranging, encompassing the [[Minimalism]] of [[Frank Stella]], the Op art of Larry Poons, the work of [[Alexander Liberman]], alongside the masters of the Op Art movement: [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], Bridget Riley and others. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. Op art, also known as optical art, is a style present in some paintings and other works of art that use [[optical illusion]]s. Op art is also closely akin to [[geometric abstraction]] and [[hard-edge painting]]. Although sometimes the term used for it is perceptual abstraction.

Op art is a method of painting concerning the interaction between illusion and picture plane, between understanding and seeing.&lt;ref&gt;John Lancaster. ''Introducing Op Art'', London: BT Batsford Ltd, 1973, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Op art works are abstract, with many of the better known pieces made in only black and white. When the viewer looks at them, the impression is given of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibration, patterns, or alternatively, of swelling or warping.

Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly [[abstract art|abstract]], formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Color Field]] painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against [[abstract expressionism]]s' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Another related movement of the late 1960s, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp.104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Conn. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyrical Abstraction]] in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[fluxus]] movement and [[postminimalism]] (a term first coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] in the pages of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969)&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. [[Postminimalism]] often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"/&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[conceptual art]], [[postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], video, [[performance art]], [[installation art]], along with the continuation of fluxus, [[abstract expressionism]], [[Color Field]] painting, [[hard-edge painting]], [[minimal art]], [[op art]], [[pop art]], [[photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[contemporary art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. "The New Art: It's Way, Way Out", ''Newsweek'' 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.

Lyrical Abstraction shares similarities with color field painting and abstract expressionism, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] as exemplified by the 1968 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''For William Blake'', (above) especially in the freewheeling usage of paint – texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However, the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[abstract expressionism]] and [[action painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in Lyrical Abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.,&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], David Novros, Paul Mogenson, [[Charles Hinman]] are examples of artists associated with [[Minimalism]] and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and [[hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Minimalism]] and [[shaped canvas]] painting in New York City during the 1960s.

During the 1960s and 1970s artists such as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], Agnes Martin, [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like Brice Marden, [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web |title=Colorscope: Abstract Painting 1960–1979 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and dozens of others produced a wide variety of paintings.

During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against abstract painting. Some critics viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the 'death of painting'. Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[video art]], [[installation art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]], [[body art]], [[fluxus]], [[happening]], [[mail art]], the [[situationists]] and [[conceptual art]] among others.

However still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[monochrome painting]] and [[hard-edge painting]] inspired by Ad Reinhardt, [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]. Artists as diverse as Agnes Martin, Al Held, [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, [[minimal art]], hard-edge painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in [[abstract expressionism]], [[neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and postminimal painting.

====Neo Expressionism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;

In the late 1960s the [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery. His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' 1973, seen above in the gallery is an example of Guston's final and conclusive return to representation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 1980s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]]. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries. This type of art continues in popularity into the 21st century, even after the art crash of the late 1980s. [[Anselm Kiefer]] is a leading figure in European [[Neo-expressionism]] by the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and collective memory, but also [[occult]] [[symbol]]ism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]]. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.

During the late 1970s in the United States painters who began working with invigorated surfaces and who returned to imagery like [[Susan Rothenberg]] gained in popularity, especially as seen above in paintings like ''Horse 2'', 1979. During the 1980s American artists like [[Eric Fischl]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] (who began as a [[graffiti artist]]), [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], and Italian painters like [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], among others defined the idea of [[Neo-expressionism]] in America.

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colours and banal colour harmonies. The veteran painters [[Philip Guston]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with slightly younger artists like [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Keith Haring]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting.

Painting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.

At the beginning of the 21st century Contemporary painting and Contemporary art in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. The "crisis" in painting and current art and current [[art criticism]] today is brought about by [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an ''anything goes'' attitude that prevails; an "everything going on", and consequently "nothing going on" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic [[superhighway]] filled to capacity. Consequently magnificent and important works of art continue to be made albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit.

During the period before and after European exploration and settlement of the Americas, including North America, Central America, South America and the Islands of the Caribbean, the [[Antilles]], the [[Lesser Antilles]] and other island groups, indigenous native cultures produced creative works including architecture, [[pottery]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[weaving]], [[Wikt:carving|carving]], sculpture, painting and [[murals]] as well as other religious and utilitarian objects. Each continent of the Americas hosted societies that were unique and individually developed cultures; that produced totems, works of religious symbolism, and decorative and expressive painted works. African influence was especially strong in the art of the Caribbean and South America. The arts of the indigenous people of the Americas had an enormous impact and influence on [[European art]] and vice versa during and after the [[Age of Exploration]]. Spain, Portugal, France, The Netherlands, and England were all powerful and influential [[colonial power]]s in the Americas during and after the 15th century. By the 19th century cultural influence began to flow both ways across the Atlantic

The depiction of humans, animals or any other figurative subjects is forbidden within Islam to prevent believers from [[idolatry]] so there is no religiously motivated painting (or sculpture) tradition within Muslim culture. Pictorial activity was reduced to [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]], mainly [[Abstract art|abstract]], with [[geometrical]] configuration or floral and plant-like patterns. Strongly connected to architecture and [[calligraphy]], it can be widely seen as used for the painting of [[tile]]s in mosques or in illuminations around the text of the Koran and other books. In fact, abstract art is not an invention of modern art but it is present in [[pre-classical]], [[barbarian]] and non-western cultures many centuries before it and is essentially a decorative or [[applied art]]. Notable illustrator [[M. C. Escher]] was influenced by this geometrical and pattern-based art. [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Aubrey Beardsley]] and the architect [[Antonio Gaudí]]) re-introduced abstract floral patterns into western art.

Note that despite the taboo of figurative visualization, some Muslim countries did cultivate a rich tradition in painting, though not in its own right, but as a companion to the written word. Iranian or Persian art, widely known as Persian miniature, concentrates on the illustration of epic or romantic works of literature. Persian illustrators deliberately avoided the use of shading and perspective, though familiar with it in their pre-Islamic history, in order to abide by the rule of not creating any lifelike illusion of the real world. Their aim was not to depict the world as it is, but to create images of an ideal world of timeless beauty and perfect order.

In present days, painting by art students or professional artists in Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries follows the same tendencies of Western culture art.

===Iran===
{{main|Persian painting|Persian calligraphy|List of Persian painters|Iranian art}}
Oriental historian Basil Gray believes "Iran has offered a particularly unique {{sic}} art to the world which is excellent in its kind". Caves in Iran's Lorestan province exhibit painted imagery of animals and hunting scenes. Some such as those in Fars Province and Sialk are at least 5,000 years old. Painting in Iran is thought to have reached a climax during the Tamerlane era, when outstanding masters such as Kamaleddin Behzad gave birth to a new style of painting.

Paintings of the Qajar period are a combination of European influences and Safavid miniature schools of painting such as those introduced by [[Reza Abbasi]] and classical works by [[Mihr 'Ali]]. Masters such as [[Kamal-ol-molk]] further pushed forward the European influence in Iran. It was during the Qajar era when "Coffee House painting" emerged. Subjects of this style were often religious in nature depicting scenes from Shia epics and the like.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

African traditional culture and tribes do not seem to have great interest in two-dimensional representations in favour of sculpture and [[relief]]. However, decorative painting in African culture is often abstract and geometrical. Another pictorial manifestation is [[body painting]], and [[face painting]] present for example in [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Kĩkũyũ]] culture in their ceremony rituals. Ceremonial [[cave painting]] in certain villages can be found to be still in use. Note that [[Pablo Picasso]] and other modern artists were influenced by [[African sculpture]] and [[masks]] in their varied styles.
Contemporary African artists follow western art movements and their paintings have little difference from occidental art works.

The [[Kingdom of Kush]] in ancient [[Nubia]] (i.e. modern [[Sudan]]), bordering [[Ancient Egypt]], produced a wide variety of arts, including wall paintings and painted objects. At the Sudanese site of [[Kerma]], center of the [[Kerma culture]] that predated the [[History of Sudan|Kingdom of Kush]], a circa 1700 BC fragmentary painting from a royal tomb depicts a [[sailing ship]] and houses with ladders that are similar to scenes in reliefs from the reign of [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian queen]] [[Hatshepsut]] (c. 1479-1458 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Hatke, George (2013).

{{see also|Picasso's African Period|Contemporary African art}}
At the start of the 20th century, artists like [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] became aware of, and were inspired by, [[African art]].&lt;ref name="African Influences in Modern Art"&gt;Murrell, Denise.

These artists saw in African art a [[Formalism (art)|formal]] perfection and sophistication unified with phenomenal expressive power.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, ''Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon and the Theater of the Absurd''. 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J.

'''Idiom''' is the syntactical, grammatical, or structural form peculiar to a [[language]].&lt;ref name="MWCD"&gt;{{Citation | author = Merriam-Webster | authorlink = Merriam-Webster | title = Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary | publisher = Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Idiom is the realized structure of a language, as opposed to possible but unrealized structures that could have developed to serve the same [[semantic]] functions but did not.

Language grammar and syntax is often inherently arbitrary and peculiar to a particular language or a [[language family|group of related languages]]. For example, although in English it is ''idiomatic'' (accepted as structurally correct) to say "cats are associated with agility", other forms could have developed, such as "cats associate toward agility" or "cats are associated of agility".&lt;ref name="Garner_2016_headword_accompanied"&gt;{{Citation |last=Garner |first=Bryan A. |author-link=Bryan A. Garner |year=2016 |title=Garner's Modern English Usage |edition=4th |location=headword "accompanied" |url=http://www.lawprose.org/bryan-garner/books-by-bryan-garner/garners-modern-english-usage-4th-edition-2016/ |isbn=978-0190491482 |quote=Idiom requires ''accompanied by'', not ''*accompanied with''—e.g.: '[…] sliced in half and accompanied with [read ''accompanied by''] no more than a small scoop of ice cream.' |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unidiomatic constructions sound wrong to fluent speakers, although they are often entirely comprehensible. For example, the title of the classic book ''[[English As She Is Spoke]]'' is easy to understand (its idiomatic counterpart is ''English As It Is Spoken''), but it deviates from English idiom in the [[grammatical gender|gender]] of the pronoun and the [[inflection]] of the verb. [[Accidental gap|Lexical gaps]] are another key example of idiom.

==Emic and etic views==
[[Monolingual]] native speakers in an insulated monolingual-native environment are mostly not conscious of ''idiomaticness'' (the quality or state of a construction matching the idiom of the given language), because in general their minds never reach for, or hear, other possible structures. The main exception is when they hear the natural experimentation of children acquiring the language, when they may encounter, for example, [[overregularization]] (for example, ''I seed two deers'' for ''I saw two deer''). By this correlation, [[solecism]] to native-speaking monolingual minds often sounds childish. However, when adults study a foreign language, they become consciously aware of idiomaticness and the lack of it. For example, in English it is idiomatic to use an [[article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite article]] when describing a person's occupation (''I am '''a''' plumber''; ''she is '''an''' engineer''), but in Spanish and many other languages it is not (''soy plomero''; ''ella es ingeniera''), and a native speaker of English learning Spanish must encounter and accept that fact to become fluent.

The [[count noun|count]] [[word sense|sense]] of the word ''idiom'', referring to [[idiom|a saying with a figurative meaning]], is related to the present sense of the word by the arbitrariness and peculiarity aspects; the idiom "she is pulling my leg" (meaning "she is humorously misleading me") is idiomatic because it belongs, by convention, to the language, whether or not anyone can identify the original logic by which it was coined (arbitrariness), and regardless of whether it translates literally to any other language (peculiarity).

'''Jackson W. Crawford''' (born August 28, 1985) is an American scholar and poet who specializes in [[Old Norse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.gravatar.com/jacksoncrawford] His own words used.&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2017, he teaches at [[University of Colorado, Boulder]] (previously at [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles]]).&lt;ref name="CU Boulder"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackson Crawford|url=http://www.colorado.edu/gsll/jackson-crawford|website=Department of Germanic &amp; Slavic Languages &amp; Literatures, University of Colorado Boulder|publisher=University of Colorado Boulder|accessdate=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in Houston, Texas, he moved to the mountains around [[Blackhawk, Colorado|Blackhawk]] and [[Central City, Colorado]] around 1995. He has a brother, Travis Crawford (born July 6, 1992), who is in college, works as a part-time tour guide at the [[Grand Canyon]], and is a photographer.

==Biography==
Crawford’s research focuses on the history of the Scandinavian languages, specializing in [[Old Norse]], [[Icelandic language|Modern Icelandic]], and [[Nynorsk]]. The focus of his Ph.D. dissertation as well as several published and forthcoming articles were on colors in the languages. He has argued, among other things, that Old Norse ''blár'' meant blue (not black), and that the language classified warm colors with an intriguing system that distinguished ideal reds with a distinct term, ''rauðr'', but lumped non-ideal reds and other warm colors into a vague category weakly focused on yellow, ''bleikr''.

Crawford is the Instructor of Nordic Studies, and Coordinator of the Nordic Program. Crawford teaches courses in the Old Norse language, [[Norse mythology]], and the history of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]]. He received [[B.A.]] in Classics and Classical Languages, Literatures, and [[Linguistics]] from [[Texas Tech University]]; an [[M.A.]] in Linguistics from the [[University of Georgia]]; and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Scandinavian Studies]] from the [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]].

He wrote and edited the quarterly publication, interpretive displays, and social media content for the [[List of museums in Wyoming|Riverton Museum]] in [[Riverton, Wyoming]] until his departure in the summer of 2015.

He was a language consultant on the film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.

==Works==
Dr. Crawford has published several books, including ''The Poetic Edda: Stories of the Norse Gods and Heroes'', intended for the use of undergraduate students and general readers, published in 2015 by [[Hackett Publishing Company]]. This was followed in 2017 by ''The Saga of the Volsungs: With the Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok'', also published by Hackett Publishing Company.&lt;ref name="CU Boulder"/&gt; He has also published creative writing in both English and Norwegian.

'''Kathryn Bridges Harley Clancy''' (also known as '''Kate Clancy''') is an American [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] who specialises in [[reproductive health]]. She is Associate Professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], in the Department of [[Anthropology]]. Her additional research and policy advocacy work focuses on [[sexual harassment]] in [[science]] and [[Academy|academia]].

== Fertility research ==
Clancy's [[fertility]] research focuses on menstruation and variability in [[Endometrium|endometrial]] function. Clancy's early published research demonstrated that, contrary to previous belief, menstruation does not increase risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Instead, Clancy and colleagues show that a thicker endometrium is associated with greater iron reserves amongst healthy women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nenko|first2=Ilona|last3=Jasienska|first3=Grazyna|date=September 2006|title=Menstruation does not cause anemia: endometrial thickness correlates positively with erythrocyte count and hemoglobin concentration in premenopausal women|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=710–713|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20538|issn=1042-0533|pmid=16917885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy's later studies focus on rural Polish populations. Clancy explores potential variation amongst endometrial function, or the functions of the inner mucous membrane layer of the [[uterus]]. Her research finds that endometrial thickness is negatively correlated over the latter phase of the menstrual cycle (the [[luteal phase]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.H.|date=2007-09-01|title=Unexpected luteal endometrial decline in a healthy rural Polish population|url=http://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115(06)00461-1/fulltext|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|language=English|volume=134|issue=1|pages=133–134|doi=10.1016/j.ejogrb.2006.07.041|issn=0301-2115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clancy's research contributes to understandings of fertility variation amongst normal, premenopausal Western women. For example, Swedish women appear to show an increase in endometrial thickness in the early part of the luteal phase, while for Canadian and English women, patterns appear largely stable at similar times. Canadian and Swedish women's endometrial thickness drops at other times, and while for Scottish sample, there is an increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CLANCY|first=KATHRYN B.H.|last2=ELLISON|first2=PETER T.|last3=JASIENSKA|first3=GRAZYNA|last4=BRIBIESCAS|first4=RICHARD G.|date=2009|title=Endometrial thickness is not independent of luteal phase day in a rural Polish population|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/117/3/117_090130/_html|journal=Anthropological Science|language=en|volume=117|issue=3|pages=157–163|doi=10.1537/ase.090130|issn=0918-7960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy and colleagues' research suggests that endometrial thickness should be measured daily to better capture and study this variation.

Clancy has also made a broader contribution to the study of human evolutionary biology and ecological stress on ovaries and endometrial function. She finds that immune stress and psychosocial stress impacts on the endometrium's ability to carry a fetus through the mechanism of inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.H.|date=2009-01-01|title=Reproductive ecology and the endometrium: Physiology, variation, and new directions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21188/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=140|issue=S49|pages=137–154|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21188|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clancy's later research focuses on primate development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461440598|title=Building Babies - Primate Development in Proximate and {{!}} Kathryn B.H. Clancy {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also dispelled the myth that women's menstrual cycles can become synchronised due to their close social bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/menstrual-synchrony/|title=Do Women in Groups Bleed Together? On Menstrual Synchrony|last=Clancy|first=Kate|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual harassment research ==
Clancy is part of a team of [[anthropologist]]s who led the '''Survey of Academic Field Experiences''' study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nelson|first2=Robin G.|last3=Rutherford|first3=Julienne N.|last4=Hinde|first4=Katie|date=2014-07-16|title=Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE): Trainees Report Harassment and Assault|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=7|pages=e102172|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[SAFE13 Study|SAFE13]]. The study, co-authored with Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and Katie Hinde, analysed experiences of sexual harassment and [[sexual assault]] in scientific fieldwork sites. The study found the majority of researchers had been exposed to, or experienced, sexual harassment, especially women and junior scientists.

A follow-up study (known as "'''SAFE 2'''"), led by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy identified systemic patterns that lead to negative fieldwork experiences and harassment. Field sites that have clear codes of conduct and consequences for behaviour are less likely to lead to sexual harassment. Where problems arise, these sites deal with issues swiftly and consistently, leading to higher levels of perceived safety and equality. In fieldwork sites where clear rules and consequences do not exist or are ambiguous, leaders do not take action against harassment. This leads to ongoing alienation and professional retaliation.

The SAFE13 study and subsequent research and activities (media interviews, conferences and advocacy) have made significant impact on increasing awareness of institutional responses to sexual harassment, as well as policy reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2018, Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing-review-sexual-harassment-and|title=Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing - A Review of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Science|date=2018-02-27|work=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.

=== Racism and gender harassment ===
In 2017, Clancy led another study on sexual harassment in collaboration with Katharine M. N. Lee, Erica M. Rodgers and Christina Richey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.

The study finds that 88% of participants had heard negative language at work, along with other verbal and physical abuse that made them feel unsafe. Women of colour, however, experienced the greatest level of hostility due to their race and gender. They experienced greater incidents of gendered and racialised harassment and were more attuned to noticing other forms of harassment such as homophobia. Forty percent of women of colour feel unsafe at work due to their gender or sex, and 28% due to their race. Women of colour are also more likely to skip educational and professional opportunities, such as meetings and conferences, in an attempt to minimise exposure to hostility and harassment.

The study received wide media coverage, as it provided evidence on how harassment limits women's career outcomes, especially for racial minority women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/07/11/women-of-color-face-staggering-harassment-in-space-science/|title=Women of color face staggering harassment in space science|last=Kaplan|first=Sarah|date=2017-07-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy also noted that the study unearths how survivors are re-traumatised by existing reporting systems that have no intermediary level of support in between staying silent and launching a formal report.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study has been commended for showing how racial discrimination compounds experiences of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/07/14/women-color-stem-face-greater-risks-gender-racial-harassment-work/467501001/|title=Women of color in STEM face greater risks of gender, racial harassment at work|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also shows that the impact of harassment contributes to a higher loss of women of colour in science relative to White women scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/unsafe-science|title=Many Women Of Color Feel Unsafe Working In Science, New Study Finds|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study raises questions about [[Bystander effect|bystander interventions]], given the hostile culture towards women of colour is evident to witnesses, who do not feel empowered to act.

{{nihongo|'''''Kumi odori'''''|組踊||[[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]: ''Kumi wudui''}} is a form of narrative traditional [[Ryukyuan people|Ryūkyūan]] dance. ''Kumi odori'' or ''Kumi wudui'' means "combination dance" or "ensemble dance".

Originating in the [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryūkyūan]] capital of [[Shuri, Okinawa]] in 1719, the original purpose of this dance was to provide amusement and diversions, which were termed ''ukwanshin'', for the Chinese diplomats who traveled to Ryūkyū. Tamagusuku Chokun, a Ryūkyūan courtier who lived from 1684–1734, is credited with the establishment of ''kumi odori'' as a frequently presented court demonstration. An amalgamation of several different types of East Asian dance, the ''kumi odori'' has continued to hold a place in Okinawan culture, and is now recognized by the Japanese government as an  [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Intangible Cultural Property]].  In 2010 it was inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00405 |title=Kumiodori, traditional Okinawan musical theatre  |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains today a prime example of native art sustained by the people of [[Okinawa]].

==Historical and political background==
The [[Ryūkyū Islands]] are composed of more than 140 islands, 40 of which inhabited, that lie beneath the southernmost Japanese main islands. A point of contention throughout the years, ownership of Ryūkyū was often disputed by major powers. The island of Okinawa was first ruled by warlords, called either ''aji'' or ''anji'', and was unified under the rule of [[Shō Hashi]] in the early fifteenth century (Smits 90). Eventually Okinawa conquered the rest of the Ryūkyū Islands, expanding its small kingdom. Trade was booming in East Asia in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries and Ryūkyū’s position as a middleman helped foster relationships with Japan and [[China]]. Once trade diminished, Ryūkyū faced the threat of invasion by Japan. In 1609, the [[Satsuma domain]] [[Invasion of Ryukyu|invaded]] the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] and forced the King to become their [[vassal]] in order to take advantage of its connections with China, and ruled only indirectly until the 1872 (Smits 91). Coincidentally, this actually served to promote Chinese culture. The ambiguity of Ryūkyū’s political status while under Japanese control was a debate that concerned most of the elite. Even though it was under Japanese domination and its leaders were aware of this, it maintained its autonomy until 1879 (Smits 107). By this time, Ryūkyū began to come under more formal Japanese control. [[Emperor Meiji]] forced the Kingdom to become a Japanese [[Ryukyu Domain|feudal domain]] in 1872, and in 1879 it was made a [[Okinawa Prefecture|prefecture]] of Japan, and then it was occupied by the United States from 1945-1972 following [[World War II]] and the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. In 1972 it was finally returned to Japan as a result of years of friction between the Okinawans and the U.S. military.

''Kumi odori'' was born out of the necessity of diplomatic acts. In 1372, King [[Satto]] of [[Chūzan]] consented to follow the tribute system with China and, as part of this system, Chinese envoys settled in Okinawa for approximately six months out of the year whenever the succession of a new king needed to be confirmed by the Chinese emperor (Foley 2). It was essential that these important visitors be entertained, so ''kumi odori'' was developed in 1719 by the ''odori bugyo'', or minister of dance, Tamagusuku Chokun. Appointed to the position in 1715, his main responsibility was to commission entertainment for the lavish banquets held for the visiting emissaries. He had previously made five trips to Japan, stopping in both Satsuma and [[Edo]] (today's [[Tokyo]]). While there, he studied all the fine arts, gaining knowledge of ''[[kyogen]], [[kabuki]]'' and ''[[Noh]]'', which greatly influenced his work (Foley 3).  He was inspired by the Chinese arts as well, and at this time Chinese literature, Confucianism, and even the [[sanshin]], an instrument later adapted for ''kumi odori'' performances, had been absorbed into Okinawan culture (Foley 2).  ''Kumi odori'' was staged for the first time at the Choyo banquet in spring of 1719: ''Shushin kaneiri'' (Possessed by Love, She Takes Possession of the Temple Bell) and ''Nido tekiuchi'' (The Children’s Revenge), which were Chokun’s first works, were performed by male aristocrats and remain a major part of the repertory to this day. With the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and the rise of [[Meiji era|Meiji]] Rule in 1868, ''kumi odori'' was all but forgotten. The aristocrats who previously enjoyed the luxuries of time and money that allowed them to study court dance were now scarce in number but, through a few notable figures, it was passed down through the generations and performed for the general population. Even the common people now had the chance to enter the schools and become performers (Thornbury 233).  After the American occupation of Okinawa came to an end and Okinawa was ceded back to Japan in 1972, there was a revival of sorts of all the indigenous art forms. The Japanese support of local Okinawan arts is a source of much debate. Although Okinawan culture was suppressed by the Japanese government during the war, but the On May 15, 1972 ''kumi odori'' was proclaimed a nationally important [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|intangible cultural property]], or ''kuni no juyo mukei bunkazai'', under the Cultural Properties Protection Law, or ''Bunkazai Hogoho. Kumi odori'' was the fifth performing art to be selected as such, joining ''gagaku'' (ancient court music), ''bunraku'' (puppet theatre), ''no'', and ''kabuki'' (other traditional Japanese dances) as corporate entities. After its inception, ''gidayu bushi, tokiwazu bushi, itchu bushi, kato bushi, miyazono bushi'', and ''ogie bushi''- all musical or narrative arts- would join them in this esteemed category (Thornbury 233-234).  After a decade of petitioning for an arts complex to house the prefecture’s native arts, the National Theatre Okinawa [https://web.archive.org/web/20090310154316/http://www.nt-okinawa.or.jp/en/] was built in [[Urasoe]]-shi, near the city of Naha in 2004. The reasons for this are not entirely clear, but despite government funding shortages, the officials in Tokyo agreed to support the project. Not only does the theatre attach importance to the city of Okinawa, but it is also a tourist attraction, which gives a more rational basis for their support (Thornbury 243).

==Elements of style==
''Kumi odori'' is a mixture of dance styles that has its roots in Okinawan, Chinese, and Japanese methods. In addition to this, it incorporates qualities from religious dances, ''kami ashibi'' or ''chondara'', and chants, ''umui'', which were prevalent in villages of the past (Foley 2). A true conglomerate, it merges music, song, narrative, and dance all for a dramatic effect. Originally performed by completely male casts of aristocratic origin, today it is also performed by women who typically take on the roles of females or young males. In the past, casting was dependent greatly on body type, and smaller males would perform these parts.
The movements of the ''kumi odori'' are very slow and deliberate. There are no shows of bravura nor are there any obvious feats of difficulty, rather the complexity of the steps lies in its restrained simplicity (Foley 6).  Highly stylized, its characteristic gliding walk is said to be one of the hardest steps to master. In classical ballet, it is said that it is more difficult to truly master bourrees (tiny connected steps en pointe which travel across the floor) than it is to complete multiple pirouettes, although the latter may look more impressive, and the same notion applies here. Generally speaking, the easier a step may seem, the harder it is to perfect. There are three levels of ''odori'' (dance): realistic actions, emotional actions, and dances within a dance. The characteristic walk discussed earlier would be an example of a realistic action, meant to tell a story. The addition of dance steps to these actions would comprise the second level, and the inclusion of travel dances, or ''michiyuki'', within the storyline would fulfill the third (Foley 7).  This is common in many forms of dance, especially in the classical ballet. Often, the main storyline will be subverted by peasant dances or divertissements provided purely for the dance itself, rather than substantially promoting the storyline. Although ''kumi odori'' shows greats parallels to the ''no'' style of performance, there are also several characteristics that provide distinction between the two. Both feature sparse settings, eliminating the need for elaborate backdrops or scenery. Similar material, structure, and quality of performance echo in both. However, where ''no'' deals with Buddhist thought, ''kumi odori'' leans toward Confucianism, choosing to promote moderation rather than enlightenment. Where ''no'' performers would typically wear a mask, ''kumi odori'' performers express their characters through makeup and other means (Foley 3-4).  Facial expressions are understated and emotion is displayed through the movements of the head or the cast of the eyes (Foley 7).  The eyes always lead the head, and just as in classical ballet, the eyes arrive first and the rest of the body follows. Such careful attention to detail gives a refined and controlled action life, without which the art would cease to give the desired impression.

There are two qualities that define a good ''kumi odori'' performance: ''kan'' and ''konashi''. ''Kan'' is similar to the idea of innate stage presence, something that cannot be learned. ''Konashi'', on the other hand, is the culmination of the skills acquired through years of experience. All performers must have both characteristics in order for a performance to be deemed good. The idea of ''hin'', or innate grace, is also important (Foley 11).  This does not come immediately and can only be achieved after years of hard work and dedication. It is said that one cannot be a good performer of ''kumi odori'', ''no'' or ''kabuki'',  until at least fifty, which is quite the opposite of the baby ballerinas favored by many in western dance. Perhaps most importantly, while no focuses on past events, the ''kumi odori'' style focuses on present action (Foley 4).  ''Kabuki'' and ''no'' both lack the heavy emphasis on music that is so important to ''kumi odori.''

==Music==
Chokun used ''ryuka'', the classical poetry of Okinawa, and classical music for his songs. Instruments typically included three stringed instruments: the ''sanshin'' (brought from China), the ''kutu'', and the ''kucho''; the ''hanso'', a flute; and two drums, the ''odaiko'' and the ''kodaiko''. The lyrics were usually sung by the ''sanshin'' players, who were the most important instrumental component, and songs were used to heighten the mood in intense situations. These songs were crucial to the performance, and often replaced dialogue much like in Broadway musicals (Foley 8).  And as opposed to the spirited music of Okinawa’s common folk, this music was formal and somewhat austere, projecting the idea of nobility through the music. Delivery is formal and full of metaphors just as in Japanese literature of the time. Two styles were applied: strong singing, or ''kyogin'', which was reserved for powerful male roles, and soft singing, known as ''wagin'' or ''yuwajin'', which was used for female or young male roles (Foley 8).  Most of the important singing was done by the musicians. The musicians either sat onstage or stage left during the performances, or sat behind a drop since the stage was ordinarily an eighteen-foot platform, much like that of the ''no'' (Foley 9).  When performed in the present day, the musicians will sit either stage left or in the wings, preserving the uncluttered look of the original, and at no time are there more than six actors on stage (Thornbury 231).  It is said that the essence of the action holds the importance, rather than the action or peripheral elements themselves. Similarly, realistic props were avoided, and would rather symbolize ideas instead of being taken literally.

==Repertory==
Although approximately sixty ''kumi odori'' pieces have been accounted for, Chokun remains the most influential figure. Not surprisingly, all of his pieces were related to ''no'' in some way, which is understandable given the success of ''kabuki'' theater’s adaptation of the same. His presentations were roughly half an hour long, unlike the two-hour-and-forty-minute performances that would come later (Foley 3).  These works are generally categorized into two groups by subject matter: domestic plays, called ''sewa mono'' and historical plays, or ''jidai mono''. ''Jidai mono'', or vendetta plays as they are often called (''kataki-uchi mono'') are frequently based on revenge, while love and filial devotion and piety are the main focus of the ''sewa mono'' (Foley 8).  ''Shushin kaneiri'' remains the most important piece of ''kumi odori'', and shares many similarities to the ''Dojoji'' legend told through many other types of theatre arts. “Chokun’s five pieces,” or ''Chokun no goban'', are completed with the addition of three more pieces: ''Mekarushii'' (The Children Left Behind), ''Onna monogurui'' (The Grief-Crazed Woman), and ''Koko no maki'' (A Tale of Filial Piety) (Thornbury 232).  Tasato Chochoku, who lived from 1703–1773, was another great figure who created enduring works like ''Manzai tekiuchi'', which translates as “Vengeance Fulfilled.” His contributions mainly centered on the theme of revenge, which in turn dealt with loyalty and devotion, as well as the creation of some comedic pieces (Thornbury 232). Five new ''kumi odori'' were developed in 2001 by [[Oshiro Tatsuhiro]],&lt;ref name=japantimes&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070130f2.html "MODERN TWIST ON 'KUMIODORI' &amp;ndash; Artists update classic Ryukyu dance"] &amp;ndash; ''The Japan Times'' (Tuesday, Jan. 30, 2007) (Retrieved on January 13, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; in the first major attempt to revamp the repertoire since 1976. 1976 marked the year Kin Ryosho, a renowned ''kumi odori'' performer and teacher finished his alteration of parts of previous works, something that is inevitable when an art form is passed from generation to generation. Kin Ryosho (金武良章, 1908–1993) taught ''kumi odori'' to both sexes at his studio in Naha. He was taught by his father, Kin Ryojin (1873–1936), a student of Amuru [[Pechin]], who was a famous performer in the last ''ukwanshin'' in 1866. Noho Miyagi (宮城能鳳) is the other notable ''kumi odori'' performer and dancer of the twentieth century. After studying under Genzo Tamagusuku, he taught at the Okinawa Geino Daigaku (University of the Arts), providing his students with the skills necessary to perform and pass on this cultural treasure (Foley 237).

==Kumi odori today==
The future of the ''kumi odori'' revival is up in the air, as the average performer is around the age of sixty, and it is difficult to raise interest when these professionals are already busy teaching and living their own lives (Thornbury 241). Most professionals belong to the ''Dento Kumi Odori Hozonkai'', and women have surpassed men in number, and while numbers may be growing, the lack of dedication compared to the earlier years will begin to take a toll on the art form. Few people have the time or resources to fully devote their lives to the study of classical performing arts today. Along with this somewhat waning interest, leading figures in the Japanese dance world believe that ''kumi odori'' needs to adapt in order to remain relevant today. Miyagi Noho, famous performer and teacher, has stated that in order to survive, ''kumi odori'' will need an overhaul (Thornbury 241).  This seems an extraordinary feat, as the repertory has not expanded much since the kingdom years, but it has been demonstrated time and again that dance needs to change to keep up with the talents of those pushing its boundaries and vice versa. When an art form becomes complacent, interest is lost, and the true artistic value starts to fade. Kin Ryosho, another important figure in the Japanese dance world has said “When something becomes too rigid, it is dead” (Foley 11). In order to faithfully represent Okinawan culture, it must develop and grow with the area while remaining true to its cultural identity.

There are two [[tumuli]] at [[Marathon, Greece]]. One is a burial mound (Greek τύμβος, ''tymbos'', tomb), or "Soros" that houses the ashes of 192 [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] who fell during the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BCE. The other houses the inhumed bodies of the [[Plataeans]] who fell during that same battle. The [[burial mound]] dominates the plain of Marathon, where the eponymous battle took place, along with the tumulus of the Plataeans, and a [[victory column]] erected by the Athenians to commemorate their victory over [[Darius I|Darius]]' [[First Persian invasion of Greece|Persian expedition]]. The tumulus is encompassed in a park today.

==Battle of Marathon==
{{main|Battle of Marathon}}
The [[Battle of Marathon]] took place on September 12, or possibly August 12, 490 BCE at the plain of Marathon. Athens and its ally Plataea, some 11,000 [[hoplites]] in total, attacked a [[Persian Empire|Persian]] expeditionary force of some 25,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, with 100,000 armed sailors acting as reserves.&lt;ref name="Herodotus: the Histories"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waterfield|first=Robin|title=Herodotus: the Histories|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenian forces attacked down a hillside onto the coastal plain, and using the momentum of their tightly packed, heavily armored formation routed the less disciplined Persian flanks, which were unused to fighting heavily armored troops. The subsequent rout left the Persian center exposed and as a result the Persians suffered high casualties as their command structure fell into disarray and as soldiers scrambled onto their ships. [[Herodotus]] claims that the Greeks counted 6,400 dead Persians on the field, but could make no account for those who fled into the swamps off to the north of the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Herodotus: the Histories"/&gt; Herodotus states that the Athenians lost 192 men in the battle and the Plataeans lost 11.

==The Monuments==
[[Image:Tumulusmarathon.JPG|thumb|The Tumulus of the Athenians.]]
There are three monuments of the plain of Marathon, the Athenian Tumulus, the Plataean Tumulus, and a victory column erected by the Athenians. Both tumuli are fairly standard with hemispherical shapes and with the dead interred within the hole left by the excavation of the dirt that would be piled on top of them. The tumuli are unusual, however, because such monumental burial practices had been out of style in central Greece since the seventh century. The Athenians normally buried their war dead in the [[Kerameikos]] cemetery, with a [[stele]] or marker vase to show the location of the deceased. However, some scholars have suggested that the raising of the tumuli was a deliberate attempt to evoke [[Homer]] by the Athenians and their allies. This concept is based on the similarities between the structure and interment method used with the tumuli, and the description of the burial practices used by and for their mythical heroes in the ''[[Iliad]]''.&lt;ref name="The Monuments That Stood before Marathon: Tomb Cult and Hero Cult in Archaic Attica."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitley|first=James|title=The Monuments That Stood before Marathon: Tomb Cult and Hero Cult in Archaic Attica.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tumulus of the Plataeans - Vranas, Marathon - April 2015 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The Tumulus of the Plataeans.]]
The Athenian Tumulus stands around {{convert|40|ft|m}} tall and was excavated in 1884 by D. Philios and then again in 1890 and 1891 by V. Stias. The Plataean Tumulus is smaller at around {{convert|10|ft|m}}, and was identified and excavated in 1970 by Prof. Marinatos, who was the Greek Inspector General of Antiquities at that time. A large layer of ash and charred bone was found in the Athenian Tumulus while multiple bodies were found inhumed in the Plataean Tumulus.&lt;ref name="Greek Warriors' Bones Found At Site of Battle of Marathon."&gt;{{cite news|title=Greek Warriors' Bones Found At Site of Battle of Marathon.|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Victory Column, which has since collapsed and been replaced with a modern replica which matches the original both in height and in general mass.

'''Mirko Tobias Schäfer''' is a media scholar at [[Utrecht University]]. He is an Associate Professor for New Media and Digital Culture at Utrecht University and directs the [[Utrecht Data School]]. 

==Biography==
Schäfer studied theater, media and communication studies at the [[University of Vienna]] and digital culture at Utrecht University. He obtained a Ph.D. in 2008 at Utrecht University. Schäfer's research revolves around technology and how they transform society. He publishes on [[digital culture]], [[cultural theory]] and [[new media]]. In 2011 he was awarded a fellowship at the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]] where he investigates artistic technology research. Schäfer is a curator at [[Impakt Festival]] and a board member of the Utrecht's media lab SetUp Utrecht. He has been a research fellow at the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]] and a postdoctoral fellow at the Centre for Humanities at Utrecht University.

==Research activity==
Schäfer conducted research on hacker communities, user participation and their impact on cultural industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtschaefer.net/media/uploads/docs/Schaefer_Bastard-Culture_2011.pdf Mirko Tobias Schaefer: Bastard Culture! How User Participation Transforms Cultural Production], Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press 2011. {{ISBN|978-90-8964-256-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark contrast to the general field of [[new media studies]] his research on [[participatory culture]] provides a critical deconstruction of user participation. Coining the term of an extended culture industry he builds upon the cultural critique of the [[Frankfurt School]], most notably [[Adorno]] and [[Horkheimer]]. Developing the concept of an extended culture industry, Schäfer could show to what extent appropriation of design by users is embedded into corporate production. Through distinguishing user participation into explicit participation and implicit participation, Schäfer delivers a terminology to separate conscious and active user engagement from user activities that are channeled by user interface design.&lt;ref&gt;Nico Carpentier in European Journal for Communication http://ejc.sagepub.com/content/27/2/211.extract&lt;/ref&gt;

Schäfer's contribution to the field of participatory culture was his distinction of implicit and explicit participation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Participatory culture#Explicit and implicit participation]]&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit participation refers to the conscious activities of cultural production and social interaction as it has been covered by [[Henry Jenkins]] in his work on fan culture. Implicit participation refers to the subtle ways of channeling user activities through interface design. Schäfer considers strategies of implicit participation as key aspect in popular social media application&lt;ref&gt;Participation Inside? User Activities between Design and Appropriation. In Marianne van den Boomen, Sybille Lammes, Ann-Sophie Lehmann, Joost Raessens, Mirko Tobias Schaefer: Digital Material. Tracing New Media in Everday Life and Technology, Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2009, pp. 147-158&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that media practices that had been developed in using the world wide web, now are implemented in easy to use interfaces and new business models. Schäfer's analysis of participatory culture depicts an accurate "shift within the commercial media industries to embrace certain conceptions of the fan as an idealized consumer of transmedia entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Jenkins (2013): Rethinking 'Rethinking Convergence Culture', Cultural Studies, 28 May 2013 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09502386.2013.801579#.UdvLfW3_geQ&lt;/ref&gt;

In his recent research Schäfer investigates how [[social media]] platforms affect practices of political organization. In his analysis, Schäfer focuses on the role of user interface design, platform governance and methods of controlling and channeling user activities.&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer in an interview with Henry Jenkins http://henryjenkins.org/2013/05/bastard-culture-an-interview-with-mirko-tobias-schafer-part-two.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus==
The book focuses on [[brand]]ing and often makes connections with the alter-globalization movement. Throughout the four parts ("No Space", "No Choice", "No Jobs", and "No Logo"), Klein writes about issues such as [[sweatshop]]s in the [[Americas]] and [[Asia]], [[culture jamming]], [[corporate censorship]], and [[Reclaim the Streets]]. She pays special attention to the deeds and misdeeds of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[The Gap (clothing retailer)|The Gap]], [[McDonald's Corporation|McDonald's]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], and [[Microsoft]] – and of their lawyers, contractors, and [[advertising agency|advertising agencies]]. Many of the ideas in Klein's book derive from the influence of the [[Situationist International|Situationists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/04/23/reviews/000423.23ledbett.html|title=Brand Names|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; an art/political group founded in the late 1950s.

However, while globalization appears frequently as a recurring theme, Klein rarely addresses the topic of [[globalization]] itself, and when she does, it is usually indirectly. She goes on to discuss globalization in much greater detail in her book, ''[[Fences and Windows]]'' ([[2002 in literature|2002]]).

==Summary==
The book comprises four sections: "No Space", "No Choice", "No Jobs", and "No Logo". The first three deal with the negative effects of brand-oriented corporate activity, while the fourth discusses various methods people have taken in order to fight back.

==="No Space"===
The book begins by tracing the history of brands. Klein argues that there has been a shift in the usage of branding and gives examples of this shift to "anti-brand" branding. Early examples of brands were often used to put a recognizable face on factory-produced products. These slowly gave way to the idea of selling lifestyles. According to Klein, in response to an economic crash in the 1980s (due to the [[Latin American debt crisis]], [[Black Monday (1987)]], the [[savings and loan crisis]], and the [[Japanese asset price bubble]]), corporations began to seriously rethink their approach to marketing and to target the youth demographic, as opposed to the [[baby boomers]], who had previously been considered a much more valuable segment.

The book discusses how brand names such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Pepsi]] expanded beyond the mere products which bore their names, and how these names and logos began to appear everywhere. As this happened, the brands' obsession with the youth market drove them to further associate themselves with whatever the youth considered "cool". Along the way, the brands attempted to associate their names with everything from movie stars and athletes to grassroots social movements.

Klein argues that large [[multinational corporation]]s consider the marketing of a brand name to be more important than the actual manufacture of products; this theme recurs in the book, and Klein suggests that it helps explain the shift to production in [[Third World]] countries in such industries as clothing, footwear, and computer hardware.

This section also looks at ways in which brands have "muscled" their presence into the school system, and how in doing so, they have pipelined advertisements into the schools and used their position to gather information about the students. Klein argues that this is part of a trend toward targeting younger and younger consumers.

==="No Choice"===
In the second section, Klein discusses how brands use their size and clout to limit the number of choices available to the public – whether through market dominance (e.g., [[Wal-Mart]]) or through aggressive invasion of a region (e.g., [[Starbucks]]). Klein argues that each company's goal is to become the dominant force in its respective field. Meanwhile, other corporations, such as [[Sony]] or [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], simply open their own chains of stores, preventing the competition from even putting their products on the shelves.

This section also discusses the way that corporations merge with one another in order to add to their ubiquity and provide greater control over their image. [[ABC News]], for instance, is allegedly under pressure not to air any stories that are overly critical of Disney, its parent company. Other chains, such as Wal-Mart, often threaten to pull various products off their shelves, forcing manufacturers and publishers to comply with their demands. This might mean driving down manufacturing costs or changing the artwork or content of products like magazines or albums so they better fit with Wal-Mart's image of family friendliness.

Also discussed is the way that corporations abuse [[copyright law]]s in order to silence anyone who might attempt to criticize their brand.

==="No Jobs"===
In this section, the book takes a darker tone and looks at the way in which manufacturing jobs move from local factories to foreign countries, and particularly to places known as [[Free trade zone|export processing zones]]. Such zones often have no labor laws, leading to dire working conditions.

The book then shifts back to [[North America]], where the lack of manufacturing jobs has led to an influx of work in the service sector, where most of the jobs are for minimum wage and offer no benefits. The term "[[McJob]]" is introduced, defined as a job with poor compensation that does not keep pace with inflation, inflexible or undesirable hours, little chance of advancement, and high levels of stress. Meanwhile, the public is being sold the perception that these jobs are temporary employment for students and recent graduates, and therefore need not offer living wages or benefits.

All of this is set against a backdrop of massive profits and wealth being produced within the corporate sector. The result is a new generation of employees who have come to resent the success of the companies they work for. This resentment, along with rising unemployment, labour abuses abroad, disregard for the environment, and the ever-increasing presence of advertising breeds a new disdain for corporations.

==="No Logo"===
The final section of the book discusses various movements that have sprung up during the 1990s. These include ''[[Adbusters]]'' magazine and the [[culture-jamming]] movement, as well as [[Reclaim the Streets]] and the [[McLibel]] trial. Less radical protests are also discussed, such as the various movements aimed at putting an end to [[sweatshop]] labour.

Klein concludes by contrasting consumerism and citizenship, opting for the latter. "When I started this book," she writes, "I honestly didn't know whether I was covering marginal atomized scenes of resistance or the birth of a potentially broad-based movement. But as time went on, what I clearly saw was a movement forming before my eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klein|first1=Naomi|title=No space, no choice, no jobs, no logo : taking aim at the brand bullies|date=2009|publisher=Vintage Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=9780307399090|page=443|edition=10th anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
After the book's release, Klein was heavily criticized by the news magazine ''[[The Economist]]'', leading to a broadcast debate with Klein and the magazine's writers, dubbed "No Logo vs. Pro Logo".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.wnyc.org/news/articles/4390 WNHC News Debate: Pro Logo vs. No Logo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2004 in literature|2004]] book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'' (published as ''Nation of Rebels'' in the United States) specifically criticized ''No Logo'', stating that turning the improving quality of life in the working class into a fundamentally anti-market ideology is shallow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rebel Sell|last=Heath|first=Joseph|last2=Potter|first2=Andrew|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=2004|isbn=1841126551|location=Ontario|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this book, Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so severely that Nike published a point-by-point response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml|title=NikeBiz {{!}} Labor {{!}} No Logo Letter|date=2001-06-18|access-date=2017-07-15|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010618162615/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml|archivedate=2001-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2000, ''No Logo'' was short-listed for the [[Guardian First Book Award|''Guardian'' First Book Award]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/firstbook2000/0,,345809,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Guardian First Book Award 2000 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the book won the following awards:

Members of the English rock group [[Radiohead]] have stated that the book influenced them particularly during the making of their fourth and fifth albums, ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000) and ''[[Amnesiac (album)|Amnesiac]]'' (2001), respectively. (The albums were recorded over the same sessions.) The band recommended the book to fans on their website and considered calling the album ''Kid A'' "No Logo" for a time.&lt;ref name="ECCLESTON"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Eccleston|first=Danny|title=(Radiohead article)|work=Q Magazine|date=October 2000|url=http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&amp;cutting=89&amp;PHPSESSID=c033bc19e81ba698894f33e264541fc4|accessdate=2007-03-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311024424/http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&amp;cutting=89&amp;PHPSESSID=c033bc19e81ba698894f33e264541fc4|archivedate=2007-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhani Harrison]], son of [[George Harrison]] and front-man of English electronic/alternative rock group [[Thenewno2]], has stated that ''No Logo'' had a large influence on their release, ''[[You Are Here (Thenewno2 album)|You Are Here]]'' (2008).{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Argentine-American rock singer [[Kevin Johansen]] wrote a song, "Logo", inspired by Klein's book.

'''The Normandy Archaeological Project''' was a [[Rescue archaeology|rescue excavation]] designed to preserve the archaeological history of the area before it became submerged by the construction of the [[Normandy Dam|Normandy Reservoir Dam]] through funding from the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]. After the construction of the dam, historic information about that area could not be accessed, so prior to the construction of the dam, as much research as possible had to be done on the area. This salvage effort was conducted in the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River Valley]] area, of [[middle Tennessee]] from March 1971 until the summer of 1975, prior to the completion of the dam in 1976. The fieldwork was done mainly by researchers from the [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville]], under contract to the Tennessee Valley Authority Contract and National Park. The dam creating the Normandy Reservoir was built on the Duck River at mile marker 248.6 in [[Coffee County, Tennessee|Coffee]] and [[Bedford County, Tennessee]], named after the town of [[Normandy, Tennessee]]. The two nearest cities are [[Manchester, Tennessee|Manchester]] and [[Tullahoma, Tennessee|Tullahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;(Introductory Report of the Normandy Reservoir Salvage Project, Volume 1, Department of Anthropology, 1973p)&lt;/ref&gt;

Large excavation projects need time for full evaluation of the project area in order to determine the relationship of the findings and obtain usable information through focusing on the hypothesis. In this way a wide view of the area and the time space within it was obtained. This large project also allowed a rare opportunity for young archaeologists to receive field training on a site soon to become forever inaccessible. The fieldwork on the Normandy project began with an investigation of surface collections to ascertain the intensity of prehistoric occupation in this portion of the valley. The sites were then mapped, with assistance from local collectors and the Coffee-Franklin County Chapter of the Tennessee Archaeological Society. Eighty three archaeological sites were found in the general project area twenty eight of which were determined to be out of the range of the maximum pool stage of the [[reservoir]] although still in danger of damage from development. Sixty-nine of the sites had previously been discovered prior to the excavations in the reservoir. Thirty of these sites were found by members of the Coffee-Franklin County Chapter of the Tennessee Archaeological Society.&lt;ref&gt;(Introductory Report of the Normandy Reservoir Salvage Project, Volume 1, Department of Anthropology, 1973,p329-330)&lt;/ref&gt; Although previous sites had been surveyed, the surrounding uplands were most often not included. Those typological areas are included in this project in an attempt to gain a better analysis of the patterns of culture and history of the ancient peoples of the Duck Valley.

==History==

===Prehistoric environment===
The Upper Duck Valley lies between the [[Highland Rim]] and the [[Nashville Basin]] in [[central Tennessee]]. The valley floor of the area lies in the basin while the rim of the valley is the highland. The Normandy Reservoir was to be built over these landscape formations. Each of these two areas were segmented into four different environmental zones; The floodplain, older alluvial terrace, valley slopes and bluffs, and uplands. Previous studies and information indicated large prehistoric sites were present in this area.
The [[subtropical climate]] of the area is characterized by hot summers and mild winters with the most [[rainfall]] occurring during the winter and spring, creating heavy stream flow in the Duck River from November to May.&lt;ref&gt;(Introductory Report of the Normandy Reservoir Salvage Project, Volume 1, Department of Anthropology, 1973p9-10)&lt;/ref&gt;

The project area has four bio geographic zones: Flood Plain Zone, Older Alluvial Terrace Zone, Valley Slopes and Bluff Zone, and the Upland Zone.&lt;ref name="DoA 73 11-34"&gt;(Introductory Report of the Normandy Reservoir Salvage Project, Volume 1, Department of Anthropology, 1973,p11-34)&lt;/ref&gt; Each zone has varying [[vegetation]] and flood patterns. Since prehistoric settlement in the area was determined, in part, by the availability of natural resources it was assumed that by examining the sites and materials found in each zone one could determine habitation and subsistence patterns in the Duck Valley area for the native inhabitants. Major occupations were found spanning the period from the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Late Archaic]], through the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] periods.&lt;ref name="NRSP 74 580"&gt;(Excavations and Testing, Normandy Reservoir Salvage Project,1974, p580)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the earlier sites, dating to the late [[Pleistocene]]/early [[Holocene]], were covered by later occupations. During the Middle Archaic period (c. 4000-6000 BC), larger sites appeared, with locations again guided by environmental factors, as was the case throughout prehistory.&lt;ref name="NRSP 74 580"/&gt;

==Agriculture and resources==

===Lithic resources===
[[Lithic fragment (geology)|Lithics]] found in the greatest abundance in the Duck Valley included: [[cryptocrystalline]] [[quartz]], blue-grey and tan [[chert]], gray banded chert, [[fossiliferous]] chert, [[limestone]], [[shale]], [[mudstone]], [[siltstone]], and [[sandstone]]. Large quantities of chert artifacts were found indicating the importance of chert as a resource for tool making.&lt;ref name="DoA 73 11-34"/&gt;

Some lithic resources found in the reservoir are thought to have been derived locally, although there were also exotic materials present. These were most likely obtained through trade with peoples in the surrounding region. Some of the exotic materials included: cryptocrystalline quartz, blue-green nodular chert, Dover chert, [[novaculite]], [[quartz]], [[vein quartz]], [[chalcedony]], Horse Mountain [[agate]], [[sandstone]], [[hematite]], [[steatite]], [[slate]], [[green slate]], [[banded slate]] and [[igneous rock]]. These materials are, in some cases long distances from their source. Some came from as far away as the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes]]. This suggests that the groups of the upper Duck Valley were not secluded, but were instead active participants in established trade with other distant groups.&lt;ref name="DoA 73 11-34"/&gt; The amount of lithic material suggests repeated use of the area over time, and was most frequently used during the Early Archaic and Late Archaic/Early Woodland periods.

Escalation of increased contact with other groups throughout the [[East South Central States|Mid-South]] is suggested by the occurrence of [[steatite]] and [[Dover chert]] at the Banks I and Banks II sites indicating inter-regional trade in the Upper Duck Valley by 1000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;(Excavations and Testing, Normandy Reservoir Salvage Project,1974, p582)&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was reported in a number of volumes written by Dr.Charles Faulkner and Major C.R. McCollough, the project directors.

===Faunal resources===
The prehistoric Indians of the Duck Valley region could have utilized the rich faunal resources available. There are at least three hundred and three [[vertebrate]]s, excluding [[fish]], which were available. [[Mollusk]] species, many still present in the Duck River today, could have also been integrated into their subsistence system. One hundred seven species of fish were available in the Duck River. [[Turtle]]s, [[alligator]]s, [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], [[owl]]s, [[quail]], [[waterfowl]], [[deer]], [[raccoon]], [[gray fox]], [[red fox]], [[mink]], [[muskrat]], [[woodchuck]], [[squirrel]], [[opossum]], [[eastern cottontail]], and [[otter]] are some of the primary animal species available. Some large mammals that were without doubt utilized by these populations included [[elk]], [[mountain lion]], [[American black bear|black bear]], [[gray wolf]], [[white-tailed deer]], and [[bison]]. The white-tail remained as the most commonly used source of meat and very constant in the diet of the DUck RIver Valley inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;(Introductory Report of the Normandy Reservoir Salvage Project, Volume 1, Department of Anthropology, 1973,p34-40)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floral resources===
The Duck Valley is a transitional zone between the Western and Mixed Mesophytic forests of the highland rim and Nashville Basin. The inhabitants of this area would have had ample [[natural resource]]s at their disposal. The [[plant]] resources available in this region are closely tied to soil [[topography]] and [[climate]]. The types of plant resources dominant in the Nashville Basin are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;(Introductory Report of the Normandy Reservoir Salvage Project, Volume 1, Department of Anthropology, 1973,p8-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zones==

===Archaeological sites in the Flood Plain Zone===
Along the river, waterfowl, birds, fish, turtles, [[aquatic mammal]]s and mollusk could all be utilized. Spring, early summer, late summer, and early fall would have been the most productive time for exploiting the resources of this region. Although resources may have been sparse in the winter months food would have still been available because of the variety of [[wildlife]] in this zone. Five sites have been recorded in this zone&lt;ref&gt;(Introductory Report of the Normandy Reservoir Salvage Project, Volume 1, Department of Anthropology, 1973p11-17)&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Digital artifact|artifact]]s were found in this zone no well defined early assemblages were recovered. The rich [[biodiversity]], fertile soil and available lithic resources made this area perhaps the most attractive zone to prehistoric inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;(Excavations and Testing, Normandy Reservoir Salvage Project,1974, p573-580)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological sites in the Older Alluvial Terrace Zone===
The large number of sites (n-64) found at the older [[alluvial terrace]] is due to the topography of the area, since there were not many animal resources available in this zone. In the closed canopy the only [[mammal]] that would find this zone attractive would be the raccoon. Spring would be the most productive time for this zone.&lt;ref&gt;(Introductory Report of the Normandy Reservoir Salvage Project, Volume 1, Department of Anthropology, 1973p18-23)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==

===Survey of the Normandy Reservoir===
The [[fieldwork]] in Normandy project began with an investigation of surface collections to ascertain the intensity of [[Prehistory|prehistoric occupation]] in this portion of the valley. The excavation was to take place between the years of 1971 to 1976. Each season would provide segmenting markers for the excavation. A volume of work was published following each complete seasonal cycle including some additional publications. The area of the Normandy project was naturally divided into two areas. The Upper Rim and the Nashville Basin, both of which were divided again for the purpose of the project, into four areas: the floodplain zone, older alluvial terrace, valley slopes, and uplands. The dam's scheduled construction was to begin in 1976.  Under this time constraint for such a large project, the project had to proceed efficiently. This is the planned and executed layout of the excavations that went underway including the most noted or distinguished sites. The course of action was to follow these steps:

* Assess the reservoir and obtain assistance from the Coffee County Chapter of the Tennessee Archaeological Society.
* Investigate and experiment the area under planned inundation.
* Using the collected data to submit a proposal to request for funding from the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and [[National Park Service]].
* Publish the first tome which would including a description of the natural area of the reservoir, a description of the system of type classification, and a description of the primary inspection of the reservoir.
*Devise a blueprint to mapping out the excavation and testing methods in efforts to answer the question of, what were the cultural, agricultural, cultivation, and population development patterns of the Duck River Valley inhabitants.
* Continue to print a tome in correspondence with each passing investigation season spent in the basin.

===Excavation sites of interest===

'''Phase I: 1971-1972'''

During this time, one-hundred and sixty eight sites were discovered with a total of two-hundred and forty five identifiable components. It is possible for a single site to have more than one component. The cultural phases associated with the components were determined by identifying the projectile points and ceramics associated with the component. These components are uncovered in phase I mainly by removal of the plow zone in search of features that may require further excavation. The component's phases identified as following: six Paleo-Indian/Clovis, ten Transitional Paleo-Archaic/Dalton/Big Sandy, seventeen Middle Archaic, twenty four Terminal Archaic/Wade, six Early Woodland/ Watts Bar/ Long Branch, forty Middle Woodland, sixteen late Woodland, ten Woodland, four Mississippian, and four late-eighteenth-to-nineteenth-century Euro-American sites.

*''Barton'': Testing was done on a Cartesian grid with 5x5 units. This was done in order to gather a more comprehensive report on stratigraphy and concentration of features on the phase I sites. An encountered midden was excavated in .5 foot levels until the subsoil was contacted.
*''Banks III'': A widespread midden was recovered and further excavated through block stripping and the removal of the plow zone. Following this and the mechanical removal of the plow zone, the site was intensively excavated by hand. Middle Woodland Owl Hollow –phase summer and winter houses were recovered.
*''Eoff I'': A Woodland midden was discovered on this site as well with recommendations of further block excavation.
*''Eoff III'': In the Floodplain zone, this was the only intensively occupied site. There were a quantity of Middle Archaic projectile points.
*''Hicks Site'': Elements of the Late Archaic Ledbetter phase were recovered and recommended for further study.
*''Nowlin II'': There was evidence of the Terminal Archaic Wade at this site which included a burial and several features.
*''Banks V'': An Extensive and preserved midden was recovered and removed through controlled surface collection and plow zone removal. This was done using a smooth-bladed Tournapull pan to create a cruciform pattern of trenches to remove the plow zone.
*''Rhoton Cave'': After removal of surface rock fall, excavation revealed an excellently preserved stratification of Woodland components with tremendous faunal preservation.

'''Phase II: 1972-1973'''

This phase began in 1973 following the phase II, tested four large sites; Riddle, Boyd II, Wiser-Stephens, and Anthony II.. During this phase two sites with indication of heavy occupation were recovered. 
*''Jernigan II'': This site was very large, covering 2 acres, it was separated into seven areas for testing and controlled surface collection before excavation could commence. Frequent Ledbetter phase features, occasional midden deposits and atypical shaft-and-chamber burial dated to the Mason –phase, and characterized this large site.
*''Body II'': A site with evidence of significant occupation and one of the largest in the upper reservoir zone with recommendation for further excavation.
Wiser-Stephens: Dating reveals this site to be associated with the Late Archaic period and Late Woodland period with greater occupation during the Late Woodland. 
*''Ewell III'': An upper reservoir site which also happened to be one of the largest.

'''Phase III: 1973-1974'''

In the following spring, summer and fall of 1973, phase III progressed. 
*''Hicks I'': A 5x70 foot trench was dug through the archaic midden. Four levels were excavated and found to contain Ledbetter-phase basin hearths.
*''Eoff I'': This site was split into two areas. On the north side was area A which was excavated with a large block. This revealed a Neal-phase occupation. A trench with a depth of two feet below the plow zone was placed through a stratified earth midden includes mostly Mason-phase components. Area B contained a 5x90 foot trench that was later converted into 20 10x10 foot unit blocks. Ledbetter, Wade, and McFarland phases were represented amongst the seventeen features that were recovered within this site. An unusually large and intensively deep stratified conical pit was recovered, but so massive that the entirety of its expansion could not be determined. The artifacts connected with it suggested it was an ancient spring that had been packed in.
*''Eoff III'': This site on the floodplain lies adjacent to Eoff I site. Middle Archaic components radiocarbon dating to 4575 BC +\- 165 were found here making it the earliest site surveyed in the reservoir although no proof of human inhabitation was recovered beneath the plow zone.
*''Banks V'': Evidence of human occupation was implied by an Owl Howl winter house discovered. Total removal of the plow zone revealed many other features, most of which were in relation to this winter house. This site received the dedication of an entire volume from the Normandy collection. Ceramic analysis implies close association of this site with the Langston culture of northern Alabama.
*''Nowlin II'': The Wright State University field school excavated this site under the direction of Bennie C.Keel
*''Ewell III'': This site underwent further investigation, which involved stripping the alluvial terrace. This revealed Wade, McFarland, and Mason phase community patterns.
*''Jernigan II'':Being the largest site in the lower reservoir zone on the right bank, it was stripped with a backhoe. Although this revealed no deposits before the Late Archaic.

'''The last two years: 1975-1976'''

Focus was shifted during these last two years. This time would be spent on intensive excavation of the four sites with the most significant elements. This was done to maintain most focus on the initial hypotheses which asked the question; What was the relationship between environment and culture during the late Archaic and Mississippian periods, or the past 4000 yrs?
*''Nowlin II'': Excavation on this site in the lower reservoir was done by the Wright State University field school and continued through June and July 1974.
*''Ewell III'': Patterns indicating Wade, McFarland, and Mason phase inhabitance patterns were discovered in the alluvial terrace of the Ewell site.
*''Jernigan II'': This site, the largest on the right bank of the lower reservoir, revealed no in situ deposits earlier than Late Archaic.on the right bank of the Duck River, was the most intensely occupied site in the lower reservoir. Within test Stratum 1 a Late Woodland Mason phase [[Shaft and chamber tomb|shaft-and-chamber grave]] was found containing the remains of a sixteen- to nineteen-year-old female year old. [[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon dated]] to AD 770 plus or minus 85 years, this is the earliest occurrence of this grave type in the [[southeastern United States]]. The well preserved remains of an infant were also found on this site.&lt;ref&gt;(Third Report on the Normandy Reservoir Salvage Project, University of Tennessee, Tennessee Valley Authority, 1976, p27-57)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Eoff I'': In 1975 excavation intensified in this area.

==Interpretations==

===Cultural phases===
The following categorizations are the result of radiocarbon dates in association with the cultural components to draw an image of the passing cultural phases. This data was derived from a sample pool consisting of eighty two radiocarbon dates and seven archaeomagnetic dates. By combining these factors, cultural phases can be placed into the proper archaeological time periods. The following is an interpretation of the cultural phases within their associated time periods. By classifying artifacts, a picture of what cultures occupied the Basin during what times can be understood. In addition, a view of when the basin remained uninhabited can also be drawn. Identifying cultural time periods and phases, along with determining patterns of occupation, can also be very beneficial when determining the amount of contact between cultural phases and groups residing simultaneously.

===Conclusions===
Subsistence developments

The hypothesis concerning the usage of plants and animals in the culture and how that relates to settlement pattern, was focused on and tested against the materials found. The question of whether or not the patterns of hunting and gathering shifted into a more agricultural focus in coordination with the passage of time from Archaic to Mississippian. White tailed deer was the primary source of meat but other vertebrates were a constant alternative. When questioning which plants were a source of food, a variety of herbaceous annuals were utilized from the late archaic and increased onto the Middle Woodland. Maize was found in context with the Owl Hollow, while other food sources such as squash and gourd rind were also recovered. Domestication of herbaceous plants such as the chenopodium, marsh elder, and even the domestication of some of these plants was evident by the Middle Woodland period. This shift to intensive gardening seems to coincide with a shift from sparse settlements to condensed communities within the fertile floodplain of the lower reservoir zone in the Owl Hollow and Banks phases.

Settlement and community patterns

The past four-thousand years was the time span in question and was concentrated on most intensively to determine whether or not the individuals were living a mobile hunter gatherer lifestyle of whether they were living in a permanent villages. In the early Middle woodland period, homes were found scattered throughout both reservoir zones, but these scattered temporary settlement patterns had shifted to more permanent homes found only in the lower reservoir by the late McFarland phase. This may have been a result of the efforts toward the construction of the Old Stone Fort enclosure. Permanent homes were found only in the lower reservoir zones during the Mississippian cultures and during the Owl Hollow phases. These observed shifts in settlement are explained with a correlation to their subsistence patterns, patterns of gardening herbaceous annuals, and some maize farming done by the Owl Hollow people. An alternative way of determining whether a home is temporary or permanent is to observe the frequency of food preparation and storage facilities. In the Archaic phase the only site with evidence of this time period is the Eoff III. The completeness of the components found here indicates the reduced frequency of use of this area as a temporary seasonal dwelling as the community shifted towards a less mobile lifestyle. In the Ledbetter phase, more [[storage pit (archaeology)|storage pits]], burials, and postholes are observed. Continuing in to the wade phase a greater degree of permanency is indicated by homes with walls and roofs. More exotic materials such as dover chert and steatite are seen in this phase which indicated a greater degree of complexity in trade and communication.

Major occupations were found in the area spanning from the Late Archaic period, through the Mississippian periods. "From archaeological observation, there is no verification of late or protohistoric Mississippian occupation of the Reservoir area".[5] Initial Native American populations were mobile hunter-gatherers living in small groups. Many of the earlier sites, dating to the late Pleistocene/early Holocene, were covered by later occupations. During the Middle Archaic period (c. 4000-6000 BC), larger sites appeared, with locations again guided by environmental factors, as was the case throughout prehistory.[5] Ceramics appeared after 1000 BC. during the Woodland period. Cultural continuation is evident between the Early Woodland Long Branch and Middle Woodland McFarland Phases. The latter phase of which seems to relate with the Copena culture of Northern Alabama. Connections to Scioto and Havana Hopewell in Ohio and Illinois and southern Hopewellian sites, like Tunacunnhee, are indicated by foreign grave goods, extravagant burial practices, and earthworks. With c. AD 200 comes the appearance of the Owl Hollow culture. There is little to no connection between the Owl culture and the Mason phase. Although some Mason culture traits, such as net impressed pottery and shaft-and-chamber graves are found in Late Woodland Cultures. Sites from the Woodland period remain small, little can be determined from this period. Only Jernigan II shows evidence of extended seasonal occupation even though occupation decreased on the Duck River during this time. Within the Upper Duck Valley, the Middle Woodland periods exhibits proof of having the densest population which consisted of 25-30 individuals, or three extended households. The upper duck river valleys continued to undergo testing to ascertain the subsistence and settlement patterns of the Middle Woodland phase.

==Surrounding sites==
Not far from Lake Normandy lies the [[Old Stone Fort (Tennessee)|Old Stone Fort]] Archaeological state park, a 2000 yr old Indian ceremonial site. Built by the people of the Middle Woodland culture, the walls and mounds that were once believed to be a fort are now thought to be a 50-acre enclosure making a ceremonial site and gathering place. The park is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lakelubbers.com › USA › South › Tennessee › Middle&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''object''' is a technical term in modern [[philosophy]] often used in contrast to the term ''[[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]''. A subject is an observer and an object is a thing observed. For modern philosophers like [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[consciousness]] is a state of [[cognition]] that includes the subject—which can never be doubted as only it can be the one who doubts—and some object(S) that may be considered as not having [[reality|real]] or full existence or value independent of the subject who observes it. [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] frameworks also differ in whether they consider objects existing independently of their [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] and, if so, in what way.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] defines the broad notion of an object as anything that we can think or talk about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/object.html|title=Object|last=Peirce|first=Charles S.|publisher=[[University of Helsinki]]|accessdate=2009-03-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214004523/http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/object.html|archivedate=2009-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a general sense it is any [[entity]]: the [[pyramids]], [[Alpha Centauri]], the number [[7|seven]], a disbelief in [[predestination]] or the [[fear of cats]]. In a strict sense it refers to any definite [[being]].

A related notion is '''objecthood'''. Objecthood is the state of being an object. One approach to defining it is in terms of objects' properties and relations. Descriptions of all bodies, minds, and persons must be in terms of their properties and relations. The philosophical question of the nature of objecthood concerns how objects are related to their properties and relations. For example, it seems that the only way to describe an apple is by describing its properties and how it is related to other things. Its properties may include its redness, its size, and its composition, while its relations may include "on the table", "in the room" and "being bigger than other apples".

The notion of an object must address two problems: the change problems and the problems of substances. Two leading theories about objecthood are [[substance theory]], wherein substances (objects) are distinct from their properties, and [[bundle theory]], wherein objects are no more than bundles of their properties.

==Change==
An attribute of an object is called a property if it can be experienced (e.g. its color, size, weight, smell, taste, and location). Objects manifest themselves through their properties. These manifestations seem to change in a regular and unified way, suggesting that something underlies the properties. The change problem asks what that underlying thing is. According to [[substance theory]], the answer is a substance, that which stands for the change.

==The problem of substance==
{{main|Substance theory}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The nature of God in Western theology]] --&gt;
Because substances are only experienced through their properties a substance itself is never directly experienced. The problem of substance asks on what basis can one conclude the existence of a substance that cannot be seen or scientifically verified. According to [[bundle theory]], the answer is none; thus an object is merely its properties.

In the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' [[Nagarjuna]] seizes the dichotomy between objects as collections of properties or as separate from those properties to demonstrate that both assertions fall apart under analysis. By uncovering this paradox he then provides a solution (''[[pratītyasamutpāda]]'' – "dependent origination") that lies at the very root of [[Buddhist]] praxis.

Although ''pratītyasamutpāda'' is normally limited to caused objects, Nagarjuna extends his argument to objects in general by differentiating two distinct ideas – dependent designation and dependent origination. He proposes that all objects are dependent upon designation, and therefore any discussion regarding the nature of objects can only be made in light of the context. The validity of objects can only be established within those conventions that assert them.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies pp. 296-297 – Karl H. Potter, [[Harold Coward|Harold G Coward]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā#24:18.2C 24:19|MMK 24-18]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In English the word ''object'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''objectus'' (pp. of ''obicere'') with the meaning "to throw, or put before or against", from ''ob''-([[prefix|pref.]]) and ''jacere'', "to throw".&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ernest (1969) ''A comprehensive etymological dictionary of the English language'', Vol II, Elsevier publishing company, Amsterdam, pp. 1066–1067&lt;/ref&gt; As such it is a root for several important words used to derive meaning, such as objectify (to materialize), objective (a future [[reference]]), and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivism]] (a philosophical doctrine that knowledge is based on objective reality).

==Reality theory==
[[Bertrand Russell]] updated the classical terminology with one more term, the ''[[fact]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1948|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Everything that there is in the world I call a fact." Facts, objects, are opposed to [[belief]]s, which are "subjective" and may be errors on the part of the subject, the knower who is their source and who is certain of himself and little else. All doubt implies the possibility of error and therefore admits the distinction between subjectivity and objectivity. The knower is limited in ability to tell fact from belief, false from true objects and engages in reality testing, an activity that will result in more or less certainty regarding the reality of the object. According to Russell,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1948|pp=148–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "we need a description of the fact which would make a given belief true" where "Truth is a property of beliefs." Knowledge is "true beliefs".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1948|p=154}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This framework of presumptions is termed the Theory of the [[Reality|Real]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1903|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the true-false distinction can be made, every object must be viewed as possibly true, a quasi-object. This extends even to those "objects" that are known to be "subjective"; individuals may determine to create a logical or rational [[entity]] that they treat as if real, a corporation, a fund, a population of elves, etc. These are typically the subjects of [[cultural anthropology]].

==Applications==

===Value theory===
[[Value theory]] concerns the value of objects. When it concerns [[economic value]], it generally deals with [[physical objects]]. However, when concerning [[philosophic or ethic value]], an object may be both a [[physical object]] and an [[abstract object]] (e.g. an action).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Physics===
Limiting discussions of objecthood to the realm of physical objects may simplify them. However, defining physical objects in terms of [[fundamental particle]]s (e.g. [[quark]]s) leaves open the question of what is the [[philosophy of physics|nature of a fundamental particle]] and thus asks what [[category of being|categories of being]] can be used to explain physical objects.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Semantics===
[[Symbol]]s represent objects; how they do so, the [[map-territory relation]], is the basic problem of [[semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dąmbska|first=Izydora|year=2016|title=Symbols|url=|journal=Poznan Studies in the Philosophy of the Sciences &amp; the Humanities|volume=105|pages=201–209|via=Humanities Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Godfrey Foote''' (26 May 1924 – 29 September 2009) was a scholar of [[Old Norse]] literature and [[Scandinavia]]n studies.  He inaugurated the Department of Scandinavian Studies at [[University College London]], and headed it for 20 years.

==Early life and education==
Foote was born and raised in [[Swanage]], [[Dorset]], the fourth of five sons of a butcher. His two eldest brothers had to leave school at 14; he and the other younger boys were able to attend grammar school. In 1942 he entered University College of the South West of England (now [[Exeter University]]) on a scholarship.

His studies were interrupted in 1943 by service in the [[Royal Navy]], mostly in the [[Far East]].

Upon demobilisation, Foote resumed his university studies at the start of 1947 and in 1948 earned a University of London external BA with first class honours. In 1948-49 he studied at the [[University of Oslo]] on a Norwegian government research studentship, and he then began postgraduate studies in the Department of English at University College, London, receiving an MA in 1951.&lt;ref name=Finlay&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/nov/18/peter-foote-obituary "Peter Foote obituary: Wide-ranging scholar of Old Norse and Icelandic literature"], ''[[The Guardian]]'' 18 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
He had already been appointed a teaching assistant&lt;ref name=Times&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6873187.ece "Professor Peter Foote: expert on Icelandic and Old Norse studies"], ''[[The Times]]'' 14 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and then assistant lecturer in Old Icelandic within the Department of Scandinavian Studies, which at the time was still part of the Department of English. Over the next 13 years he advanced to reader in Old Scandinavian and then in 1963 to professor of Scandinavian Studies, with the separation of the field from English as a new department.

Together with Hugh Smith, director of University College's Department of English and Scandinavian Studies in the 1950s,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Foote saw the wisdom of studying Old Norse literature and culture in association with the modern Scandinavian languages and the history of all the Scandinavian countries.  In his inaugural lecture in 1964, on ''[[Færeyinga saga]]'',&lt;ref name=Finlay/&gt; Foote looked forward in this spirit to the college teaching [[Icelandic language|modern Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]],&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and treating Scandinavian history as a unified field. He said then: "Old Scandinavian . . . confers a welcome freedom, so that I may with perfect propriety offer a lecture on an Icelandic text concerning Atlantic islanders of Norwegian origin whose descendants have now for some centuries technically owed allegiance to the Danish crown".&lt;ref name=Finlay/&gt;

Foote expanded the new department during his tenure, adding first a full-time position in Scandinavian philology (1964), then another in Norse studies (1965), classes in Faroese (1968), then a teaching assistantship in modern Icelandic (1970s), and finally after considerable effort a lectureship in Nordic history (1970).&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

He continued to teach occasionally at University College until 2006, more than twenty years after retiring.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Abram, [http://oldnorsenews.org/2009/10/peter-foote/ "Peter Foote"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101120954/http://oldnorsenews.org/2009/10/peter-foote/ |date=1 November 2010 }}, Old Norse News 1 October 2009, accessed 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCL&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/scandinavian-studies/peter_foote "Professor Peter Foote (1924-2009)"], UCL Scandinavian Studies, University College London, accessed 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also very active in the [[Viking Society for Northern Research]], editing ''Saga-Book'', its journal, from 1952 to 1976 and serving twice as president (1974–76 and 1990–92) among other positions.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

He received honorary doctorates from the [[University of Iceland]] and the [[University of Uppsala]] and national honours from [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]].

==Publications==
Foote was greatly respected for the quality of his translations,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; which included ''[[Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu]]'' (1957) and together with others, the ancient Icelandic law book ''[[Grágás]]'' (''Laws of Early Iceland'', 1980 and 2000). He co-wrote ''The Viking Achievement'' (1960) with [[David M. Wilson]]. After he retired he produced a three-volume edited translation, the first English edition, of [[Olaus Magnus]]'s 16th-century Latin ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus|Description of the Northern Peoples]]'' (1996–98) and edited ''[[Jóns saga helga]]'' (2003).&lt;ref name=Finlay/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCL/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1951 Foote married Eleanor McCaig, from the [[Stranraer]] region, whom he had met in the Far East during [[World War II]] when she was a nurse. She died in 2006. They had two daughters and a son.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; He enjoyed walking and bell-ringing, and participated until 2008 in a reading group that took its name, the Orðhenglar ("Pedants"), from his insistence on correct Icelandic.&lt;ref name=Finlay/&gt;

'''Powhatan''' or '''Virginia Algonquian''' is an [[extinct language]] belonging to the [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]] subgroup of the [[Algonquian languages]]. It was spoken by the [[Powhatan]] people of [[tidewater Virginia]]. It became extinct around the 1790s after speakers were [[Linguistic imperialism|forced under duress]] to speak English.{{sfn|Mithun|1999|p=332}}{{sfn|Siebert|1975|p=290}} The sole documentary evidence for this language is two short wordlists recorded around the time of first European contact. [[William Strachey]] recorded about 500 words and [[Captain John Smith]] recorded only about 50 words.{{sfn|Lovgren|2006|p=}}{{sfn|Siebert|1975|p=291}} Smith also reported the existence of a [[pidgin]] form of Powhatan, but virtually nothing is known of it.{{sfn|Campbell|2000|p=20}} Like many Algonquian languages, Powhatan did not have a writing system, so all that is left are the recordings from the 17th century and the piecing together that can be done using related Algonquian languages.

Strachey’s material was collected sometime between 1610 and 1611, and probably written up from his notes in 1612 and 1613, after he had returned to England. It was never published in his lifetime, although he made a second copy in 1618. The second copy was published in 1849, and the first in 1955.{{sfn|Siebert|1975|p=291}} Smith’s material was collected between 1607 and 1609 and published in 1612 and again in 1624. There is no indication of the location where he collected his material. In 1975, Frank Siebert, a linguist specializing in Algonquian languages, published a book-length study claiming the "reconstitution" of the phonology of the language.

Although the language had become extinct, some of the tribes that were part of the Powhatan chiefdom still remain close to their lands. These tribes include [[Mattaponi]], [[Nansemond]], [[Chickahominy]], [[Pamunkey]] and [[Patawomeck]], all of whom are either recognized by the Commonwealth of Virginia or the Federal Government. There is also the Powhatan Renape Nation (formerly located on the [[Rankokus Indian Reservation]] in [[Burlington, New Jersey]]) that is working to reclaim their culture and educate the public.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
This table is based on Frank T. Siebert's reconstruction of the Powhatan language. He used the notes of John Smith but relied primarily on the work of [[William Strachey]] recorded between 1610 and 1611. Siebert also used his knowledge of the patterns of other Algonquian languages in determining the meaning of Strachey's notes. This table provides the practical symbols along with their [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] equivalents, in brackets.

===Vowels===
Siebert gives a very simplified table in his work with very little indication of whether a tone is high or low, but based on standard IPA, we can assume that "i" is high, "e" and "o" is mid and "a" is Low. He also mentions that the short "a" and "e" are weak vowels. As seen in the consonant chart, Sibert's original lettering and the IPA symbols are both represented in this chart with the IPA symbols in brackets.

===Syllable structure===

Siebert does not specifically go over the structure of syllables, but using the lexicon and examples that he does provide, (C)V(ː)(C) pattern can be determined. Clusters within words are limited to two consonants, CVCCVC.

=== Stress===

The Powhatan language uses [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] to determine the stressed syllable in words, more specifically the syncopation of weak vowels, /a/ and /e/. [[Syllable weight]] is determined based on whether or not the first syllable contains a weak vowel. If it does, then even numbered syllables are heavy and odd numbered syllables are light. For example, /nepass/, which means sun, would be pronounced /ne|PASS/. If the word starts with a strong vowel, then it is the opposite, with the even numbered syllables being light and the odd numbered syllables being heavy. For example, /wiːngan/, which means good, would be pronounced /WIːN|gan/.
 
There are two kinds of syncope: major and minor. Major syncopation happens in morphemes that are three or more syllables in the middle of the word. This especially happens in light syllables ending in /s/ or /h/. Some examples of this are in the words spoon and broom. "Spoon" would be pronounced /eː | MEH | koːn/, but with major syncopation, it is pronounced /eːm | KOːN/. For "broom", it would pronounced /ČIː | keh | KAHI | kan/, but with the syncopation, it ends up /ČIːK| kahi | KAN/. Notice that the last example is a prime example of the light syllable that ends in /h/ being syncopated.

Minor syncopation tends to be optionally and only seen is specific dialects. Syllable weight is not a factor and instead it depends on if the word begins with /m/ or /n/ or ends with an /s/ or a cluster including /s/ such as /sk/. An example of this is in the word for five which would be pronounced /pa | REːN | eskw / and is instead pronounced as /pa | REːN| esk/ or /pa|REːN| sk/.

===Historical phonological changes===

Based on his work to reconstruct Powhatan, Siebert was able to compare the changes that the language might have made compared to [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]] and Proto-Eastern Algonquian. Here are three of the most basic changes his research pinpointed:

All syllabic phonemes are the same in between Proto-Eastern Algonquian and Powhatan and the only change between those two and Proto-Algonquian is that word initial /ɛ/ became an /a/ in Powhatan and Proto-Eastern Algonquian. Ex: PA /ɛšpeːwi/ 'it is high' → /aspeːw/

Word final vowels are deleted if they are preceded by a consonant between Proto-Algonquian and Powhatan. Ex: PA /myeːneθki/ 'earthwork' → /meːnesk/

Powhatan drops the difference between /s/ and /š/ that is found in Proto-Algonquian. Similarly, PA /l/ becomes a /r/ in Powhatan, unless it in a word final position of a particle or inflectional morphemes, where it is deleted. Furthermore PA /θ/ becomes a /t/. Ex: PA /šiːˀšiːpa/ 'duck' → /siːssiːp/ ; PA /leːkawi/ 'sand' → /reːkaw/ ; PA /aθemwehša/ 'little dog' → /atemoss/

== Morphology==

===Nouns===

===Pronouns===
In Powhatan, nouns take [[Inflection|inflective]] affixes depending on their class. There seems affixes only added to 3rd person noun. These nouns are not only categorized as singular and plural, but also animate and inanimate. For the animate group there are the [[Grammatical person|proximate]] and [[obviative]] classes. This is quite common for Algonquian languages. The singular proximate class receives no affix, while the plural receives an /-ak/ suffix. For the obviative class, there is no distinction between singular and plural, both receiving an /-ah/ suffix. Finally, for inanimate nouns, singulars receive no suffix and plurals receive an /-as/ suffix.

===Diminutives===
Powhatan has 6 affixes for naming items diminutively. These affixes function by a rule of [[Sandhi|internal sandhi]]. The last ending in the list is the most commonly seen diminutive. The following are the affixes themselves:
* /-ins/ ex: /mehekwins/ "little stick"
* /-eːns/ ex: /piːmenahkwaːneːns/ "small cord"
*/-es/ or /-is/ ex: /mahkateːs/ "small coal"
*/iss/ ex: /metemsiss/"old woman"
*/eːss/ ex: /mossaskweːss/ "muskrat"
*/ess/  ex: /eːrikwess/ "ant"

===Verbs===
There are 3 types of verb affixes of the Powhatan language, all of which are inflective. Powhatan is a language that follows an [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] pattern. Although it might have lost some of its strict rule, there is a clear pattern where the indication of person is pretty consistent regardless of the type or class of verb.

====Animate intransitive independent (AI) verbs====

The chart below presents the affixes taken by animate [[Intransitive verb|intransitive verbs]]. The first and second singular persons usually take the /ne-/ prefix, unless the verb ends with a long "a", /aː/, in which case it takes a /ne-m/ [[circumfix]]. In the plural, 1st person has 2 forms, [[Clusivity|'we' inclusive]] and [[Clusivity|'we' exclusive]].

|}

===Transitive inanimate independent indicative===

The second group of verbs is for inanimate [[Transitive verb|transitive verbs]]. These verbs only have singular subjects, but that does not prevent them from having a singular and plural form. These verbs also fall into 3 different classes of their own and well as two negative forms.

===Transitive animate===
This class of verb is used to express action done to other people and things. Notice the hierarchy that occurs, especially in the 1st singular form with a 2nd singular object. When referring an I to you relationship, like /koːwamaːnes/ 'I love you', an variant of the 2nd person prefix, /ko-/ is used instead of the 1st person /ne-/ prefix even though "I" is the subject.

==Syntax==
Possibly due to the fact that Siebert's research was more focused on reconstructing Powhatan for the purpose of comparing it to Proto-Algonquian or because the notes of Smith and Strachey do not lend themselves to analyzing it, syntax is not discussed in Siebert's research nor are there any examples of what sentences might have been like. However, by looking at other languages in the same family as Powhatan, some basic patterns can be established:

It has been established that Powhatan is considered an agglutinative language, meaning that morphemes can be added on to words to communicate more descriptive meanings. This happens especially in verbs, allowing one long word to basically represent a whole sentence. This almost eliminates the importance of word order.

Other languages in the Algonquian family are marked with [[obviative]]/[[proximate]] endings, which clarify the subjects of focus, especially in telling stories.

There is not enough data recorded to put together a definite list of the imperatives, but Strachey documents imperatives being used. Therefore, using those lists and what is known about Proto-Eastern Algonquian, a tentative list can be created. Some examples of these imperatives are as follows: /pasekwiːs/ " arise you!" ; /pyaːk/ "come you all!" ; /ontenass/ "you take it away from there!" ; /miːčiːs/ "you eat it!" ; /miːčiːk/ "you all eat it!" ;

|  style="width:100px; "| /-ek/
|  style="width:100px; "| */-amok/
|  style="width:100px; "| /-ek/
|}
* presumed ending

Finally, as explained in the transitive animate verbs section, there are circumstance of animacy hierarchy with direct objects in Powhatan. Instead of the hierarchy going 1st person, 2nd person, 3rd person, there is a pattern of 2nd person, 1st person, 3rd person. For example, to say "I strike him" it would be /nepakamaːw/, where the /ne-/ prefix for 1st person is first and the /-aːw/ for 3rd person is at the end. However to say something like " I feed you", it would be /keassakmes/ with the /ke-/ prefix for 2nd person at the beginning and a different /-es/ suffix for 1st person at the end. This might be a result of a practice of respect for others before oneself. "It is one of the few languages that give greater importance to the listener than the speaker," Dr. Blair Rudes, the linguist that worked on reconstructing the language for the movie [[The New World (2005 film)|The New World]], remarked in an interview.

==Dialect variation==
Siebert's 1975 study also examined evidence for dialect variation. He found insufficient justification for assigning any apparent dialects to particular areas.{{sfn|Siebert|1975|pp=295–296}}{{sfn|Feest|1978|p=253}} Strachey’s material reflects considerable lexical variation and minor phonological variation, suggesting the existence of dialect differentiation. A speculative connection to the [[Chickahominy (tribe)|Chickahominy]] and [[Pamunkey]] Virginia Algonquian tribes has been suggested, but there is no evidence to support this link.{{sfn|Siebert|1975|p=291}}

The table below gives a sample of words reflecting lexical variation. Each word is given as written by Smith or Strachey, followed by a proposed [[Phoneme|phonemic representation]].{{sfn|Siebert|1975|pp=}}

==Powhatan loan words in English==
Siebert credited Powhatan with being the source of more English loans than any other indigenous language.{{sfn|Siebert|1975|p=290}} Most such words were likely borrowed very early, probably before Powhatan—English conflict arose in 1622. Among these words are: ''chinquapin'' (''[[Castanea pumila]]''), ''[[wikt:chum|chum]]'' (as in ''[[chumming]]''), ''[[hickory]]'', ''[[hominy]],'' ''[[matchcoat]],'' ''[[moccasin]],'' ''[[muskrat]],'' ''[[opossum]],'' ''[[persimmon]],'' ''[[pokeweed]]'', ''pone'' (as in ''[[corn pone]]''), ''[[raccoon]],'' ''[[terrapin]],'' ''[[wikt:Special:Search/tomahawk|tomahawk]],'' and ''[[Dirca|wicopy]].''{{sfn|Siebert|1975|p=290}}

==Reconstruction for ''The New World''==
For the film ''[[The New World (2005 film)|The New World]]'' (2005), which tells the story of the English colonization of Virginia and encounter with the Powhatan, [[Blair Rudes]] made a tentative reconstruction of the language "as it might have been." A specialist in the American Indian languages of North Carolina and Virginia, he used the Strachey and Smith wordlists, as well as the vocabularies and grammars of other [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] languages and the [[sound correspondence]]s that appear to obtain between them and Powhatan. More specifically, he used a Bible translated into [[Massachusett language|Massachusett]] to piece together grammar and Proto-Algonquian to compare the words in Smith and Strachey's records. {{sfn|Lovgren|2006|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;Rudes, Blair A. 2011. "In the Words of Powhatan: Translation across Space and Time for 'The New World'", In ''Born in the Blood: On Native American Translation,'' edited by Brian Swann.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The material for the ''Précis'' had been previously been part of a history that Voltaire spent twenty years working on and which included ''[[Essai sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations]]'' (''Essay on the customs and spirit of the nations'') and ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]''. The ''Precis'' was introduced in 1762 as an appendix within this larger work, but later published separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXXlCgQR4V8C|title=The Age of Voltaire: The Story of Civilization|last=Durant|first=Will|last2=Durant|first2=Ariel|date=2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781451647662|page=800|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voltairefoundation.wordpress.com/2015/05/11/battles-on-and-off-the-field/|title=Battles on and off the field|last=|date=2015-05-11|website=Voltaire Foundation|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
Voltaire comments on the trial of [[Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally]]; a case he had been following closely. Lally had been a successful military officer, and personally known to Voltaire. When Lally was involved at a military defeat, relinquishing the Indian town of [[Pondicherry]] to the English, his fellow officers blamed him. On his return to France, Lally was imprisoned without charge, put on trial in which he was denied a lawyer, and finally executed.&lt;ref name="davidson"/&gt; In his account of the case, Voltaire wrote, "His character made him detested by all who had to do with him. But that is not a reason for cutting off a man's head. The briefs both for and against him, which I have read attentively, contain nothing but insults, and not the least proof."&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davidson|first1=Ian|title=Voltaire in Exile|date=2004|publisher=Atlantic books|isbn=1843540878|pages=159–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Precis'' also praises the courage of the Corsicans in defending against the French at the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]]. Voltaire writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The principal weapon of the Corsicans was their courage. This courage was so great that in one of these battles, near a river named Golo, they made a rampart of their dead in order to have the time to reload behind them before making a necessary retreat […] Bravery is found everywhere, but such actions aren’t seen except among free people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/sebastien-r-le-morillon/rethinking-napoleon%E2%80%99s-roots|title=Rethinking Napoleon’s Roots|last=Le Morillon|first=Sebastien R.|date=30 November 2015|website=History Today|publisher=|access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Read with Me''' is a reading promotion project in [[Iran]] for disadvantaged children in marginal areas of big cities and those living in remote and deprived areas of the country. The project is designed and implemented by the Institute for Research on the History of Children’s Literature in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Page|first=Liz|date=2016-06-28|title=Focus IBBY|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/621993|journal=Bookbird: A Journal of International Children's Literature|volume=54|issue=3|pages=83–92|doi=10.1353/bkb.2016.0099|issn=1918-6983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Read with Me was started as a pilot project in 2010 in a marginal area of south-east [[Tehran]] close to brick kilns where some 120 Afghan families lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibby.org/awards-activities/activities/sharjah-ibby-fund/iran-sharjahibby-fund/?L=3|title=Iran - Sharjah / IBBY Fund: IBBY official website|website=www.ibby.org|language=es|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, the project has been expanded to 19 provinces in Iran covering over 60,000 children and young adults and more than 2500 teachers, preschool tutors or volunteers. The project is funded by donations and mainly run by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usbby.org/list_asahi.html|title=USBBY - IBBY-Asahi Reading Promotion Award|website=www.usbby.org|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a group of tutors from [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar-e-Sharif]], [[Afghanistan]] joined the project covering about 1000 children in this city and nearby villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://khanak.org/en/read-with-me-second-phase-in-mazar-e-sharif/|title="Read with Me" starts the new school year in Mazar-e-Sharif with motivation! {{!}} Read with Me|website=khanak.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Course of Action ==
Quality books suitable for children, based on their age-group, literacy level, cultural and social condition, are selected and packed in book-bags. In every package or bag, there are handbooks for the teachers or interested parents to guide them. Two-day training workshops are organized every 3 months for teachers, librarians, and volunteers.

Reading aloud sessions are held in classes. Teachers encourage discussion and exchange of views about the story, aiming to develop critical thinking. Reading sessions are accompanied by related art and craft activities, with an emphasis on role-playing and drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://publishingperspectives.com/2016/04/winners-hans-christian-andersen-asahi-reading|title=At Bologna: Winners in the Hans Christian Andersen &amp; Asahi Awards|date=2016-04-05|work=Publishing Perspectives|access-date=2017-05-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; To monitor and improve the implementation, all activities are documented for further evaluation of the project.

== History ==

The Society was founded by Allan Nevins and a few colleagues who were critical of what Nevins in a 1939 ''Saturday Review'' article called the "pedantic school" of history—academics who, he said, seemed to take pride in writing badly.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Middlekauff, "Telling the Story of the Civil War: Allan Nevins as a Narrative Historian," ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' 56 (Winter, 1993): 72&lt;/ref&gt; Nevins, who taught history for over 35 years at Columbia University, was the author of more than 50 books, including an eight-volume history of the American Civil War and biographies of John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, and Grover Cleveland (which won the 1933  [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]]). A journalist for fifteen years before coming to Columbia (he never earned a Ph.D.), Nevins was the master of a robust and readable style, and continued throughout his life to write for radio and the popular press.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald L. Fetner, ''Immersed in Great Affairs: Allan Nevins and the Heroic Age of American History'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, in an effort to bring good historical writing to a wide audience, the Society collaborated in establishing the magazine  [[American heritage magazine|''American Heritage'']] as a popular illustrated bimonthly.&lt;ref&gt;Mark C. Reynolds, [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/golden-anniversary-1?page=show "Golden Anniversary," ''American Heritage,'' Nov./Dec. 2004].

[[File:Estátua de frade em Almeirim.JPG|thumb|Statue of a monk and stone soup (''sopa da pedra'') in Almeirim, Portugal.]]
'''Stone Soup''' is an old [[Folklore|folk story]] in which hungry strangers convince the people of a town to each share a small amount of their food in order to make a meal that everyone enjoys, and exists as a [[Moral#In moral tales|moral]] regarding the value of sharing. In varying traditions, the stone has been replaced with other common inedible objects, and therefore the fable is also known as '''axe soup''', '''button soup''', '''nail soup''', and '''wood soup'''.

==Story==
Some travelers come to a village, carrying nothing more than an empty cooking pot. Upon their arrival, the villagers are unwilling to share any of their food stores with the hungry travelers. Then the travelers go to a stream and fill the pot with water, drop a large [[Rock (geology)|stone]] in it, and place it over a fire. One of the villagers becomes curious and asks what they are doing. The travelers answer that they are making "stone [[soup]]", which tastes wonderful and which they would be delighted to share with the villager, although it still needs a little bit of [[Garnish (food)|garnish]], which they are missing, to improve the flavor. 

The villager, who anticipates enjoying a share of the soup, does not mind parting with a few carrots, so these are added to the soup. Another villager walks by, inquiring about the pot, and the travelers again mention their stone soup which has not yet reached its full potential. The villager hands them a little bit of [[seasoning]]. More and more villagers walk by, each adding another ingredient. Finally, the stone (being inedible) is removed from the pot, and a delicious and nourishing pot of soup is enjoyed by travelers and villagers alike. Although the travelers have thus tricked the villagers into sharing their food with them, they have successfully transformed it into a tasty and nutritious meal which they share with the donors.

== Variations ==
*The [[Eastern Europe]]an variation of the story (which is similar to the Northern European rendition) is called "axe soup", with an [[axe]] as the catalyst.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

*In the [[French folklore|French]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Russians|Russian]] versions of the tale, the travelers are [[soldier]]s returning home.
**In the Hungarian version, a single starving soldier encounters several hardships on his journey back to his homeland.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} At the end of the story, he sells the rock to the villagers after eating the soup.
**In Russian tradition, a soldier prepares "axe [[kasha]]" ({{lang|ru|[[:s:ru:Каша из топора|Каша из топора]]}}).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

*[[Johann Peter Hebel]] wrote a [[German language|German]] version, "''Der schlaue Pilgrim''" ("The Cunning Pilgrim", 1811),&lt;ref name="Ashliman"/&gt; in which a wily [[pilgrim]], allegedly on his way to [[Jerusalem]], tricks a hostess step-by-step into adding rich soup ingredients to his [[Pebble|pebble stones]], finally leaving the stones uneaten.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

*In Northern European and [[Scandinavia]]n countries, the story is most commonly known as "nail soup", and the main character is typically a [[tramp]] looking for food and lodgings, who convinces an old woman that he will make a tasty [[Nail (fastener)|nail]] soup for the both of them if she would just add a few ingredients for the garnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nail Soup - traditional swedish folk-tale|url = http://hem.fyristorg.com/kulturkemi/net/soup.htm|website = wayback.archive.org|accessdate = 2015-11-28|deadurl = bot: unknown|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020316195723/http://hem.fyristorg.com/kulturkemi/net/soup.htm|archivedate = 2002-03-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*In the Portuguese tradition, the traveler is a [[monk]], and the story takes place around [[Almeirim]], Portugal. Nowadays {{lang|pt|sopa de pedra}} is considered a regional dish of Almeirim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cm-almeirim.pt/conhecer-almeirim/gastronomia/item/202-sopa-de-pedra-receitas |title=Sopa da Pedra - Receitas|trans-title= Stone soup - recipes|website=Almeirim Municipal Chamber |date=  |author=|language=Portuguese |accessdate= 18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the Chinese version, three monks are the ones who place a stone into a pot and boil the soup. Villagers who are curious pass by and add ingredients such as carrots, rice wine, pepper, salt etc.

==Cultural and historical references==
In the [[Aarne-Thompson-Uther]] folktale classification system this tale and set of variants is type 1548.&lt;ref name="Ashliman"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Stone Soup: folktales of Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 1548 | work =D.

===Art, entertainment, and media===

===="Stone soup"-like collaborations====
There are many examples of projects referencing the "Stone Soup" story's theme of making something significant by accumulating lots of small contributions. Examples include: 
*''[[Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup]]'' a computer game which expanded on an abandoned project using contributions from many different coders; 
*''[[Stone Soup (magazine)|Stone Soup]]'', a children's literary magazine published by the California-based Children’s Art Foundation since 1973; 
*[[Stone Soupercomputer]], a computer composed of many small units;

===Adaptations===

====Film====
The film ''[[Fandango (1985 film)|Fandango]]'' (1985) contains a wedding sequence towards the end which builds on the Stone Soup theme. The protagonists need to hold a wedding ceremony, but they lack any funds to do so. Therefore, they set up a folding [[card table]] by the main street of a sleepy Texas town, dust it off, and invite passersby to come to the wedding. As they concoct stories of delinquent caterers and crashed champagne trucks, the friendly townspeople contribute their time and resources, the result being a magical wedding ceremony.

====Literature====
[[William Butler Yeats]]' play, ''The Pot of Broth'' (1904), tells a version of the story in which a clever Irish tramp uses his wits to swindle a shrewish medieval housewife out of her dinner.{{sfn|Yeats|2010|pages=109–119}}

The story is the basis of [[Marcia Brown]]'s 1947 children's book, ''Stone Soup'' (1947),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Marcia|authorlink=Marcia Brown|title=Stone Soup (1947)|year=2005|isbn=978-0689878367|publisher=[[Aladdin Paperbacks]]|location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features soldiers tricking miserly villages into cooking them a feast. The book was a [[Caldecott Honor]] book in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stone Soup, 1948 Honor|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/caldecotthonors/1948honorstonesoup|publisher=Association for Library Service to Children|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was read aloud by the Captain (played by [[Bob Keeshan]]) on an early episode of ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' in the 1950s, as well as at least once in the 1960s or early 1970s.{{sfn|Spicer; Disbrowe|2007|page=9}}{{sfn|Bradbury|2010|page=66}}

In 1965, [[Gordon R. Dickson]] published a short story called "Soupstone", where a headstrong pilot is sent to solve a problem on a planet under the guise of a highly educated and competent official. He succeeds by pretending to understand everything, but actually merely making the locals apply their already present knowledge and abilities to the task.

"Stone Soup" (1968),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Stone-Soup-Ann-Mcgovern/dp/0590416022|title=Stone Soup (1968)|date=1986|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Inc]]|isbn=978-0590416023|last=McGovern|first=Ann|authorlink=Ann McGovern|edition=Reissue}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Ann McGovern]] and illustrated by Nola Langner, tells the story of a little old lady and a hungry young man at the door asking for food, and he tricks her into making stone soup.

Canadian children's author Aubrey Davis adapted the story to a [[Jewish]] context in his book ''Bone Button Borscht'' (1996). According to Davis, he wrote the story when he was unable to find a story that he liked for a [[Hanukkah]] reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Aubrey|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Bone_Button_Borscht.html?id=751hAAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Bone Button Borscht|year=2002|publisher=Turtleback Books|location=[[St. Louis]]|isbn=978-0613991032}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Budd]]'s narration of ''Bone Button Borscht'' traditionally airs across Canada on [[CBC Radio One]]'s ''[[As It Happens]]'', on the first day of [[Hanukkah]].

[[Jon J. Muth]]'s children's book based on the story, also called ''Stone Soup'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Jon J. Muth|first=Jon J.|last=Muth|title=Stone Soup|year=2003|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Press]]|location=[[New York City]]|url=https://www.amazon.com/Stone-Soup-Jon-J-Muth/dp/043933909X|edition=1st|isbn=978-0439339094}}&lt;/ref&gt; is set in [[China]], as is [[Ying Chang Compestine|Ying Chang's]] ''[[The Real Story of Stone Soup]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-3107728801.html|title=Stone Soup: A Story about Using Story for Research|last=Kimmel|first=Sue|date=July 2013|work=School Libraries Worldwide|access-date=31 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801034300/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-3107728801.html|archive-date=2017-08-01|dead-url=yes|subscription=|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Stone Soup" (2014), Cas Willing and Paula Rego (illustrations), children's book

====Music====
[[Shel Silverstein]]'s song, "The Wonderful Soup Stone", tells a version of this story. [[Bobby Bare]] included the song on his album ''Lullabys, Legends and Lies'' (1973).&lt;ref name="Amazon entry"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Bobby Bare Sings Lullabies Legends &amp; Lies|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bobby-Bare-Sings-Lullabies-Legends/dp/B000ROAL8K|work=[[Amazon.com]]|location=[[Seattle]]|accessdate=October 1, 2013}},&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show]] included the song on their album ''Belly Up!'' (1973).

A version of the tale written by [[Tom Chapin]] and [[John Forster (musician)|John Forster]] appears on Chapin's album ''Mother Earth'' (1990).

====Television====
*[[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Storyteller (TV series)|The Storyteller]]'' series contains one tale called "A Story Short", in which the Storyteller himself (played by [[John Hurt]]) is the main character. In the beginning, he arrives at a castle where a man is thrown out for begging for food. He proceeds to trick the King's cook into making stone soup. After the people are happily fed, the cook realizes what has happened and pleads with the King to let him boil the Storyteller in oil, but the King instead offers a way out — to tell him a story every day for a year instead.
*The [[PBS Kids]] show ''[[Between the Lions]]'' featured an episode with a version of the story being read. In this version, the strangers were replaced by aliens.
* The tale was adapted as an episode of the show ''[[Hungarian Folktales]]''.
* A [[:ru:Каша из топора|Soviet cartoon]] based on the Russian variant of the tale was made in 1982.

===Lucky Iron Fish===
A contemporary twist on "nail soup" helps relieve real-world [[iron deficiency anemia]] in [[Cambodia]]. The [[lucky iron fish|Lucky Iron Fish]] is a [[cast iron]] bar in the shape of the "Try Kantrop" fish that many villagers consider lucky. When immersed into a simmering pot of soup, enough of the iron dissolves into the liquid to add the critical amounts of a trace nutrient needed to prevent certain types of anemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/12/25/434942455/in-cambodia-lucky-iron-fish-for-the-cooking-pot-could-fight-anemia|work=The Salt (NPR Morning Edition)|author=Sullivan, Michael (Host)|title=In Cambodia, 'Lucky' Iron Fish For The Cooking Pot Could Fight Anemia |date=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military tactics===
US Army General [[George S. Patton, Jr.]] referred to the "rock soup method" of acquiring resources for attacks in the face of official disapproval by his superiors for offensive operations. In the military context, he sent units forward, ostensibly on reconnaissance missions, to later reinforce them when resistance was met, and these missions eventually turned small scale probes into all out attacks; he notably did this during the [[Battle of Sicily]], in the advance on [[Palermo]], and again in the campaign in northwest Europe, notably near [[Metz]] when his [[3rd US Army]] was officially halted during [[Operation Market Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farago|first=Ladislas |title=Patton: Ordeal and Triumph (1970)|publisher=Westholme Publishing LLC|year=2005|location=[[Yardley, Pennsylvania]]|url=https://www.amazon.com/Patton-Ordeal-Triumph-Ladislas-Farago/dp/1594160112|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Places===
The big pool at Karl Johan street in Oslo, funded by the steel company ''Christiania Spigerverk'' ("Christiania Nail Factory"),  is nicknamed ''[[Spikersuppa]]'' ("Nail Soup") as a humorous reference to the story.

{{wikisourcelang|ta|திருக்குறள்|Tirukkural}}
The '''Tirukkural''' ({{lang-ta|திருக்குறள்}}, literally ''Sacred Verses''), or shortly '''the Kural''', is a classic [[Tamil language|Tamil]] text consisting of 1,330 couplets or [[Kural (poetic form)|Kural]]s, dealing with the everyday virtues of an individual.{{sfn|C. Blackburn, 2000|pp=449–482}}{{sfn|Pillai, 1994|p=}} It is one of the two oldest works now extant in [[Tamil Literature]] in their entirety, the other being the [[Tolkappiyam]].{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=24}} Considered one of the greatest works ever written on ethics and morality, chiefly [[secular ethics]], it is known for its universality and non-denominational nature.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} It was authored by [[Thiruvalluvar|Valluvar]], also known in full as Thiruvalluvar. The text has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 7th century CE. The traditional accounts describe it as the last work of the third [[Sangam literature|Sangam]], but linguistic analysis suggests a later date of 450 to 500 CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}}

Traditionally praised as "the Universal Veda" and "the Universal Code of Conduct,"{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=22}}{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=155–156}} the Kural emphasizes on the vital principles of [[non-violence]], [[moral vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]],{{Ref label|A|a|none}} human brotherhood, absence of desires, path of righteousness and truth, and so forth, besides covering a wide range of subjects such as moral codes of rulers, friendship, agriculture, knowledge and wisdom, sobriety, love, and domestic life.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} The work is commonly quoted in vegetarian conferences, both in [[India]] and abroad.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=10–16}} Considered as chef d'oeuvre of both Indian and world literature,{{sfn|Pyatigorsky, n.d.|p=515}} the Kural is one of the most important works in the [[Tamil language]] and is often called "the masterpiece of Tamil Literature."{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=24}} This is reflected in some of the other names by which the text is given by, such as the Work of Three Books, Modern Veda, Divine Work, Faultless Word, and Tamil Veda.{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=22}}{{sfn|Cutler, 1992|pp=}}

The Kural has influenced several scholars across the ethical, social, political, economical, religious, philosophical, and spiritual spheres.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=7–13}}{{sfn|Sundaramurthi, 2000|p=624}} Authors influenced by the Kural include [[Ilango Adigal]], [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Constantius Joseph Beschi]], [[Karl Graul]], [[George Uglow Pope]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], and [[Yu Hsi]], many of whom have translated the work into their languages. Translated into at least 40 languages as of 2014, the Kural is one of the [[List of literary works by number of translations|most widely translated works]] in the world.{{sfn|Ashraf, n.d.}} Because the life, culture and ethics of the [[Tamil people|Tamils]] are considered to be solely defined in terms of the values set by the Kural, the government and the people of [[Tamil Nadu]] alike uphold the text with utmost reverence.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} Along with the [[Gita]], the Kural is a prime candidate nominated to be the national book of India, for which a declaration was passed at the [[Tamil Nadu Assembly]] in 2006.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=63–80}}

==Etymology==
{{main|Glossary of names for the Tirukkural}}
The term ''Tirukkural'' is a compound word made of two individual terms, ''tiru'' and ''kural''. ''Tiru'' is an honorific Tamil term that corresponds to the universally Indian, Sanskrit term ''sri'' meaning "holy, sacred, excellent, honorable, and beautiful."{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}} The term ''tiru'' has as many as 19 different meanings.{{sfn|Nedunchezhiyan, 1991|p=vii}} ''Kural'' means something that is "short, concise, and abridged."{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}} Etymologically, ''kural'' is the shortened form of ''kural paattu'', which is derived from ''kuruvenpaattu'', one of the two Tamil poetic forms explained by [[Tolkappiyam]], the other one being ''neduvenpaattu''.{{sfn|Kowmareeshwari, 2012a|pp=iv–vi}} According to Winslow, ''kural'' is used as a literary term to indicate "a metrical line of 2 feet, or a distich or couplet of short lines, the first of 4 and the second of 3 feet." Thus, ''Tirukkural'' literally comes to mean "sacred couplets."{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}}

The Kural is unique among ancient works that it did not have a name nor did it have any mention of the author's name in it at the time of its release at the ruler's court at the city of [[Madurai]], the seat of the [[Third Sangam|Third Tamil Sangam]].{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=i (Introduction)}} The author used the title ''Muppāl'', meaning "three divisions," to present it to the King,{{sfn|Pillai, 1972|p=3}} since the work was written about the first three of the four ancient Indian aims in life, known as ''[[Puruṣārtha|purushaarthas]]'', viz., virtue, wealth and love,{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}}{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333, 4341}} with the fourth aim, namely, salvation (''moksha''), implicitly said in the last five chapters of Book I.{{sfn|Pillai, 1972|pp=5–7}} Remaining nameless for several years after its writing, the work came to be referred to by various names in the centuries that followed. Nine traditional names had already been in use to refer to the book during the time of writing of the ''[[Tiruvalluva Maalai]]'', a eulogy written on the Kural by various poets between the 1st and 11th centuries CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=155–156}} Nevertheless, the title ''Muppāl'' remained the work's primary name until the 13th century CE.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=105}} It is estimated that the Kural has historically been known by as many as 44 names given at various periods over the millennia, making it one of the numerously titled works.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=54–55}}

==Organization of the work==
The Kural is structured into 133 chapters, each containing 10 couplets (or kurals), for a total of 1,330 couplets.{{sfn|Kumar, 1999|pp=91–92}}{{Ref label|B|b|none}} The 133 chapters are grouped into three parts, or "books":{{sfn|Kumar, 1999|pp=91–92}}{{sfn|Mukherjee, 1999|pp=392–393}}
* Book I – Aṟattuppāl (அறத்துப்பால்): [[Aram (Kural book)|Book of Virtue]] ([[Dharma]]), dealing with virtues independent of the surroundings (Chapters 1-38)
* Book II – Poruṭpāl (பொருட்பால்): [[Porul (Kural book)|Book of Polity]] ([[Artha]]), dealing with virtues with respect to the surroundings (Chapters 39-108)
* Book III – Kāmattuppāl (காமத்துப்பால்): [[Inbam (Kural book)|Book of Love]] ([[Kama]]), dealing with virtues involved in conjugal human love (Chapters 109-133)

Each ''kural'' or couplet contains exactly seven words, known as ''cir''s, with four ''cir''s on the first line and three on the second, following the [[Kural (poetic form)|kural]] [[Poetic metre|metre]]. A ''cir'' is a single or a combination of more than one Tamil word. For example, the term ''Thirukkural'' is a ''cir'' formed by combining the two words ''thiru'' and ''kuṛaḷ''. The book on ''Aṟam'' (virtue) contains 380 verses, that of ''Poruḷ'' (wealth) has 700 and that of ''Inbam'' (love) has 250.{{sfn|Kumar, 1999|pp=91–92}}

The overall organisation of the Kural text is based on seven ideals prescribed for a commoner besides observations of love.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}} This includes 40 couplets on God, rain, ascetics, and virtue; 200 on domestic virtue; 140 on higher yet most fundamental virtue based on grace, benevolence and compassion; 250 on royalty; 100 on ministers of state; 220 on essential requirements of administration; 130 on morality, both positive and negative; and 250 on human love and passion.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}}{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}}

== Date ==
{{main| Dating the Tirukkural}}
The Kural has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 7th century CE. According to traditional accounts, it was the last work of the third [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam]], and was subjected to a divine test (which it passed). The scholars who believe this tradition, such as Somasundara Bharathiar and M Rajamanickam, date the text to as early as 300 BCE. Historian [[K. K. Pillay]] assigned it to the early 1st century CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}}

Linguist [[Kamil Zvelebil]] is certain that ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' does not belong to the [[Sangam literature|Sangam]] period, and dates it to somewhere between 450 and 500 CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}} His estimate is based on the language of the text, its allusions to the earlier works, and its borrowing from some Sanskrit treatises.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=156}} Zvelebil notes that the text features several grammatical innovations, that are absent in the older Sangam literature. The text also features a higher number of [[Sanskrit]] [[loan word]]s compared to these older texts.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=169}} According to Zvelebil, besides being part of the ancient Tamil literary tradition, the author was also a part of the "one great Indian ethical, didactic tradition," as a few of his verses seem to be translations of the verses in Sanskrit texts such as ''[[Dharmaśāstra|Mānavadharmaśāstra]]'' and [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthaśāstra]].{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=171}}

[[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]] assigned the work to c. 650 CE, believing that it borrowed from some Sanskrit works of 6th century CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}} Zvelebil disagrees with this assessment, pointing out that some of the words that Pillai believed to be Sanskrit loan words have now been proved to be of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] origin by [[Thomas Burrow]] and [[Murray Barnson Emeneau]].{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=171}}

In the face of incessant debate on the precise date, taking the latest of the estimated dates, the [[Government of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu government]] officially declared 31 BCE as the year of Valluvar, as suggested by [[Maraimalai Adigal]], on 18 January 1935, adding Valluvar Year to the calendar.{{sfn|''Thiruvalluvar Ninaivu Malar'', 1935|p=117}}{{Ref label|C|c|none}}

Very little is known about Valluvar, the author of the Kural. In his work ''The Smile of Murugan'', [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Scholar [[Kamil Zvelebil]] cites a tradition suggesting he was an outcaste by birth, the issue of a union between a Brahmin man and a Pariah woman. Some think that he was a weaver by caste.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} He is believed to have been born in the temple town of [[Mylapore]], a locality within the present-day [[Chennai]], and is said to be a simple weaver by profession who wrote the kurals with divine inspiration. He was married to [[Vasuki (wife of Valluvar)|Vasuki]]. The first instance of the author's name mentioned as "Valluvar" is found to be several centuries later in a song of praise called the ''[[Tiruvalluva Maalai]]''.{{sfn|Acharya.iitm.ac.in, n.d.}} Just as the book remained unnamed at the time of its presentation at the court of the ruler, the author too did not name himself in the writing of the book. Over the centuries that followed, people started calling the work "Tirukkural" and its author as "Thiruvalluvar". [[Monsieur Ariel]], who translated the Kural text into French, thus praised it as "the book without a name by an author without a name."{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=i (Introduction)}} There are also claims and counter-claims as to the authorship of the book and to the exact number of couplets written by Valluvar.

Valluvar is thought to have belonged to either [[Jainism]] or [[Hinduism]]. This can be observed in his treatment of the concept of [[ahimsa]] or [[non-violence]], which is the principal concept of both the religions. Valluvar's treatment of the chapters on [[moral vegetarianism]] (or [[veganism]]){{Ref label|A|a|none}} and [[non-killing]] reflects the Jain precepts, where these are stringently enforced.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} The three parts that the Kural is divided into, namely, ''aram'' (virtue), ''porul'' (wealth) and ''inbam'' (love), aiming at attaining ''veedu'' (ultimate salvation), follow, respectively, the four foundations of Hinduism, namely, [[dharma]], [[artha]], [[kama]] and [[moksha]].{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}} His mentioning of God [[Vishnu]] in couplets 610 and 1103 and [[Goddess Lakshmi]] in couplets 167, 408, 519, 565, 568, 616, and 617 suggests the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] beliefs of Valluvar. Other eastern beliefs of Valluvar found in the book include previous birth and rebirth, seven births, and some ancient Indian astrological concepts, among others.{{sfn|Natarajan, 2008|pp=1–6}} Despite using these contemporary religious concepts of his time, Valluvar has limited the usage of these terms to a metaphorical sense to explicate the fundamental virtues and ethics, without enforcing any of these religious beliefs in practice. This, chiefly, has made the treatise earn the title ''Ulaga Podhu Marai'' (the universal scripture).{{sfn|Natarajan, 2008|pp=1–6}}

There is also the recent claim by Kanyakumari Historical and Cultural Research Centre (KHCRC) that Valluvar was a king who ruled Valluvanadu in the hilly tracts of the [[Kanyakumari district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}} The only other book that is attributted to Valluvar other than the Kural text is ''Gnanavetti'', a text that deals with spiritual aspects, due to which the author is also known as "Gnanavettiyan."{{sfn|Aranga Ramalingam, 1994|pp=}}

==Structural plan of the work==
[[File:Thiruvalluvar Statue at Kanyakumari 02.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=2|The statue of Valluvar, the author of the Kural text, at [[Kanyakumari]]]]
Having written by a single author, the Kural literature reveals a single structural plan.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=160}} The Kural is not an anthology for there is not any later additions to the text.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158–160}} According to [[Kamil Zvelebil]], the content of the Kural text is "undoubtedly patterned."{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=163}} The entire work has been structured very carefully without an allowance for any structural gaps in the text such that every couplet remains indispensable for the structured whole. Thus, one can find two distinct meanings for every couplet in the Kural literature, namely, a structural one and a proverbial one. In their isolated form, that is, when removed from the content-structure, the couplets lose their structural meaning, the most important of the two, with the isolated distiches still remaining charming and interesting in themselves. This simply makes the isolated couplet a wise saying or a moral maxim, "a 'literary proverb' in perfect form, possessing, in varying degree, the prosodic and rhetoric qualities of gnomic poetry."{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158–163}} On the other hand, within the content-structure, the couplets acquire their structural meaning in relation to other couplets, forming higher patterns, and finally, in relation to the entire work, they acquire perfection in the totality of their structure.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158–163}}

According to [[Perunchithiranar (Tamil nationalist)|Pavalareru Perunchithiranar]], Valluvar has employed 28 different methods of conveying thoughts in the Kural text.{{sfn|Perunchithiranar, 1933}}

==Substance of the work==
Written with the contemporary society in view{{sfn|Parthasarathy, ''The Hindu'', 12 December 2015}} and marked by [[pragmatic idealism]],{{sfn|Top 12 Economists of India}} the Kural text is unique among the ancient literature in terms of both its poetic and its intellectual accomplishments.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|p=4333}} In poetic terms, it fuses verse and aphoristic form in diction in a "pithy, vigorous, forceful and terse" manner. In intellectual terms, it is written on the basis of [[secular ethics]], expounding a universal, moral and practical attitude towards life. Unlike religious scriptures, the Kural refrains from talking of hopes and promises of the other-worldly life. Rather it speaks of the ways of cultivating one's mind to achieve the other-worldly bliss in the present life itself. By occasionally referring to bliss beyond the worldly life, Valluvar equates what can be achieved in humanly life with what may be attained thereafter.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} Only in a couple of introductory chapters (Chapters 1 and 3) does Valluvar sound religious. Even here, he maintains a tone that could be acceptable to people of all faiths.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}}{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=36–37}}

It is believed that Valluvar composed every chapter in response to a request to produce ten best couplets on a particular subject. Nevertheless, he seldom shows any concern as to what [[similes]] and [[superlatives]] he used earlier while writing on other subjects, purposely allowing for some repetition and mild contradictions in ideas one can find in the Kural text. Despite knowing its seemingly contradictory nature from a purist point of view, Valluvar employs this method to emphasise the importance of the given code of ethic. Following are some of the instances where Valluvar employs contradictions to expound the virtues.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}}

* While in Chapter 93 Valluvar writes on the evils of intoxication, in Chapter 109 he uses the same to show the sweetness of love by saying love is sweeter than wine.
* To the question "What is wealth of all wealth?" Valluvar points out to two different things, namely, grace (Kural 241) and hearing (Kural 411).
* In regard to the virtues one should follow dearly even at the expense of other virtues, Valluvar points to veracity (Kural 297), not coveting another's wife (Kural 150), and not being called a slanderer (Kural 181). In essence, however, in Chapter 33 he crowns non-killing as the foremost of all virtues, pushing even the virtue of veracity to the second place (Kural 323).
* Whereas he says that one can eject what is natural or inborn in him (Kural 376), he indicates that one can overcome the inherent natural flaws by getting rid of laziness (Kural 609).
* While in Chapter 7 he asserts that the greatest gain men can obtain is by their learned children (Kural 61), in Chapter 13 he says that it is that which is obtained by self-control (Kural 122).

Nevertheless, the basic ideas of Valluvar is found in the introductory section of the Kural, which includes the first four chapters of the text. Valluvar begins this portion with the invocation of God and continues to praise the rain for being the vitalizer of all life forms on earth and describe the qualities of a righteous person, before concluding the introduction by emphasizing the value of ''aṟam'' or virtue.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}} Valluvar extols rain next only to God for it provides food and serves as the basis of a stable economic life by aiding in agriculture, which Valluvar asserts as the most important economic activity later in Book II of the Kural text.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}}

{{Quote box|width=300px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=right|quote="Alone, first of good things, is 'not to slay';&lt;br&gt;The second is, no untrue word to say."|salign=right|source=(Kural 323; Pope, 1886).{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=44}}}}
The entire writing of all the three books of the Kural text bases ''aṟam'' or [[dharma]] as its cornerstone, which resulted in the Kural being referred to simply as ''Aṟam''.{{sfn|Alathur Kilar|pp=Verse 34}}{{sfn|Kowmareeshwari, 2012b|pp=46–47}}{{sfn| Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|p=55}} Contrary to what the [[Manusmriti]] says, Valluvar holds that ''aṟam'' is common for all, irrespective of whether the person is a bearer of [[palanquin]] or the rider in it.{{sfn|Valluvar|pp=Verse 37}}{{sfn|Visveswaran, 2016|pp=ix–xi}} The greatest of virtues according to Valluvar is [[non-killing]], followed by [[veracity (ethics)|veracity]],{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4341–4342}}{{sfn|Sethupillai, 1956|pp=34–36}} which he plainly indicates in couplet 323,{{sfn|Valluvar|pp=Verse 323}} and the two greatest sins that Valluvar feels very strongly are ingratitude and [[meat-eating]].{{sfn|Sethupillai, 1956|pp=34–36}}{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|p=13}}{{sfn|Jagannathan, 1963|pp=162–163}} As observed by [[P. S. Sundaram]] in the introduction to his work, while "all other sins may be redeemed, but never ingratitude," Valluvar couldn't understand "how anyone could wish to fatten himself by feeding on the fat of others."{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|p=13}} The Kural differs from every other work on morality in that it follows ethics, surprisingly a divine one, even in its Book of Love.{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=26}} In the words of [[Gopalkrishna Gandhi]], Valluvar maintains his views on personal morality even in the Book of Love, where one can normally expect greater poetic leniency, by describing the hero as "a one-woman man" without concubines.{{sfn|Parthasarathy, ''The Hindu'', 12 December 2015}}

==Comparison with other ancient literature==
[[File:Tirukkural manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Palm leaf manuscript of the Tirukkural]]
Unlike the mystic philosopher of [[Lao Tzu]] or the law-giving prophets of the [[Judaeo-Christian tradition]], Valluvar remained a philosopher concerning with the day-to-day conduct of a common individual.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}} Scholars compares the codes of virtue, nobility, propriety, just governance, conduct, social obligations, self-control, education and knowledge with other ancient thoughts such as the Confucian sayings in [[Lun Yu]], [[Hitopadesa]], [[Panchatantra]], [[Manusmriti]], [[Tirumandiram]], [[Book of Proverbs]] in the Bible, sayings of the [[Buddha]] in [[Dhammapada]], and the ethical works of Persian origin such as [[Gulistan (book)|Gulistan]] and [[Bustan (book)|Bustan]], in addition to the holy books of various religions.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}}

===Similarities with ancient Indian literature===
Several ancient Indian literature such as [[Manusmriti]], [[Kautilya]]'s [[Arthashastra]], [[Kamandaka]]'s [[Nitisara]] bear likeness with the second book (''Porul''), the book on wealth, of the Kural text, while [[Vatsyayana]]'s [[Kamasutra]] shares similarities with ''Inbam'', the third book of the Kural text (the book on love).{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}} However, the attitude and approach of Valluvar in expounding the virtues remain entirely different from any of these contemporary works. While the Artha Shastra is based on subtle statecraft, the ''Porul'' of the Kural text bases morality and benevolence as its cornerstones.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|pp=901–902}} The social hierarchies and discrimination found in Manusmriti are contrasted with Valluvar's concept of universal brotherhood and oneness of humanity. Unlike Kamasutra, which is all about eros and techniques of sexual fulfillment, the Kural text of ''Inbam'' remains a poetic appreciation of flowering human love as explicated by the Sangam period's concept of intimacy, known as ''aham'' in the Tamil literary tradition.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}}

===Similarities with Confucian thoughts===
The Kural text and the [[Confucianism|Confucian sayings]] recorded in the classic [[Analects|Analects of Chinese]] (called ''Lun Yu'', meaning "Sacred Sayings") resemble each other in many ways. Both Valluvar and [[Confucius]] focused on the behaviors and moral conducts of a common person. Similar to Valluvar, Confucius advocated legal justice embracing human principles, courtesy, and [[filial piety]], besides the virtues of [[wiktionary:benevolence|benevolence]], [[righteousness]], [[loyalty]] and [[trustworthiness]] as foundations of life.{{sfn|Balasubramanian, 2016|pp=104-111}} Incidentally, Valluvar differed from Confucius in two respects. Firstly, unlike Confucius, Valluvar was also a poet. Secondly, Confucius did not deal with the subject of [[conjugal love]], for which Valluvar devoted an entire division in his work.{{sfn|Anonymous|1999|p=vii}}

==Publication of the work==
[[File:Thirukkural Madras 1812.JPG|thumb|150px|First known edition of the Kural, published in Tamil, in 1812.]]

Save for the highly educated circle of scholars and elites outside the Tamil land, the Kural remained largely unknown to the outside world for close to one-and-a-half millennia. It had been passed on as word of mouth from parents to their children and from preceptors to their students for generations within the Tamil-speaking regions of [[South India]]. It was not until 1595 when the first translation of the work appeared in [[Malayalam]] that the work became known to the wider circle outside the Tamil-speaking communities.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44–49}} The work first came to print in 1812, with the Kural text getting published in Tamil, chiefly by the efforts of the then Collector of Madras [[Francis Whyte Ellis]], who established the "Chennai Kalvi Sangam."{{sfn|S. Blackburn, 2006|pp=92–95}} It was published by Thanjai Gyanaprakash.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} It was only in 1835 that Indians were permitted to establish printing press. Thus, the Kural became the first book to be published in Tamil.{{sfn|Madhavan, ''The Hindu'', 21 June 2010}} Soon, Mahalinga Iyer published the first 24 chapters of the Kural with commentaries for the first time. In 1850, the complete work of the Kural was published with commentaries by [[Vedagiri Mudaliar]], who published a revised version later in 1853. This publication was later used by [[Ramalinga Adigal|'Vallalar' Ramalinga Adigal]] to teach the Kural to the masses.{{sfn|Kolappan, ''The Hindu'', 3 October 2018}}

==Commentaries and translations==
{{main|Translations of Tirukkural|List of Tirukkural translations by language|Tirukkural translations into English}}

===Commentaries===
The Kural is arguably the most reviewed of all works in [[Tamil literature]], and almost every notable scholar has written commentaries (explanation in prose or verse) on it.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}}{{Ref label|D|d|none}} According to R. Ilankumaran, there are four requisites necessary to write commentaries to the Kural text:{{sfn|Ilankumaran, 2018|p=xi}}
# The awareness that the meaning of everything that is written in the Kural text is available in the work itself
# A workable knowledge of the [[Tolkappiam]]
# A thorough knowledge of the [[Sangam literature]] and [[Sangam landscape|landscape]]
# A practical knowledge of how things work in their nature.

There have been several commentaries written on the Kural over the centuries. Many poets of the first few centuries of the [[common era]] used various Kural couplets to illustrate their works. These include [[Ilango Adigal]], [[Seethalai Satthanar]], [[Sekkilar]], [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]].{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}} These can be considered the first commentaries to the Kural text, albeit in verse form and incomplete.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}} In the centuries that followed, numerous commentators of various other works employed Kural couplets to elaborate their ideas, providing explanations to the couplets in the process, both in verse and in prose forms.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}} These include Adiyarkku Nallar, Nacchinaarkiniyar, Mayilainathar, and Shankara Namacchivayar.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=338}}

Exclusive commentaries on the Kural text started appearing much later. There were at least ten medieval commentaries written by pioneer poets of which only six are available today. The [[Ten Medieval Commentators|ten canonical medieval commentators]] include [[Manakkudavar]], [[Dharumar]], [[Dhamatthar]], [[Nacchar]], [[Paridhi|Paridhiyar]], [[Thirumalaiyar]], [[Mallar (poet)|Mallar]], Kaliperumal or [[Pari Perumal]], [[Kaalingar]], and [[Parimelazhagar]], all of whom lived between the 10th and the 13th centuries CE. Of these, only the works of Manakkudavar, Paridhi, Kaalingar, Pari Perumal, and Parimelazhagar are available today. The works of Dharumar, Dhaamatthar, and Nacchar are only partially available. The commentaries by Thirumalaiyar and Mallar are lost. The pioneer among these commentators are Parimelazhagar and Manakkudavar.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}}{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}}{{sfn|Natarajan, 2008|p=2}} Besides these, there are three more medieval commentaries written by unknown authors.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=339}} One of them was published under the title "Palaiya Urai" (meaning ancient commentary), while the second one was based on Paridhiyar's commentary.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=339}} The third one was published in 1991 under the title "Jaina Urai" (meaning Jaina commentary) by [[Saraswathi Mahal Library]] in [[Thanjavur]].{{sfn|Balasubramanian, 2016|p=129}} Following these medieval commentaries, there are at least 21 [[venba]] commentaries to the Kural, including Somesar Mudumoli Venba, Murugesar Muduneri Venba, Sivasiva Venba, Irangesa Venba, and Vadamalai Venba, all of which are considered commentaries in verse form.{{sfn|Nedunchezhiyan, 1991|p=ix}}

Several modern commentaries started appearing in the 19th and the 20th centuries. Some of the commentaries of the 20th century include those by [[Iyothee Thass]], [[V. O. Chidambaram Pillai]], [[Thiru Vi Ka]], [[Bharathidasan]], [[M. Varadarajan]], [[Namakkal kavignar]], [[Thirukkuralar V. Munusamy]], [[Devaneya Pavanar]], [[Karunanidhi|M. Karunanithi]], and [[Solomon Pappaiah]].

===Translations===
[[File:Tirukkural.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas-relief]] inscriptions of the Kural couplets at [[Valluvar Kottam]]]]
The first translation known of the Kural text is a Malayalam translation that appeared in about 1595. However, the manuscript remained unpublished and was first reported by the Annual Report of the Cochin Archeological Department for the year 1933 to 1934.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44–49}} The [[Christian missionaries]] who came to [[India]] during the [[colonial era]], inspired by the similarities of the [[Christian ideal]]s found in the Kural, started translating the text into various [[European languages]].{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|pp=28–47}} The [[Latin]] translation of the Kural, the first of the translations into European languages, was made by [[Constanzo Beschi|Constantius Joseph Beschi]] in 1730. However, he translated only the first two parts, viz., virtue and wealth, leaving out the section on love assuming that it would be inappropriate for a Christian missionary to do so. The first French translation was brought about by an unknown author by about 1767 that went unnoticed. The first available French version was by Monsieur Ariel in 1848. Again, he did not translate the whole work but only parts of it. The first [[German language|German]] translation was made by [[Karl Graul|Dr. Karl Graul]], who published it in 1856 both at [[London]] and [[Leipzig]]. Graul's translation was unfortunately incomplete due to his premature death.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|pp=30–31}} The first, and incomplete, [[English language|English]] translations were made by N. E. Kindersley in 1794 and then by [[Francis Whyte Ellis]] in 1812. While Kindersley translated a selection of the Kural text, Ellis translated 120 couplets in all—69 of them in verse and 51 in prose.{{sfn|S. Blackburn, 2006|pp=92–95}}{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1992|pp=}} [[William Henry Drew (Christian missionary)|W. H. Drew]] translated the first two parts in prose in 1840 and 1852, respectively. It contained the original Tamil text of the Kural, Parimelazhagar's commentary, Ramanuja Kavirayar's amplification of the commentary and Drew's English prose translation. However, Drew was able to translate only 630 couplets, and the remaining were made by [[John Lazarus (Christian missionary)|John Lazarus]], a native missionary. Like Beschi, Drew did not translate the part on love.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=31}} The first complete English translation of the Kural was the one by [[George Uglow Pope]] in 1886, which brought the Kural to the western world.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=32}}

By the end of the 20th century, there were about 24 translations of the Kural in English alone, by both native and non-native scholars, including those by [[V. V. S. Aiyar]], [[K. M.

Vanmikanathan]], [[Kasturi Srinivasan]], [[S. N. Sriramadesikan]], and [[K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar]].{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=36}} At present, the Kural has been translated into 37 languages.{{sfn|Ashraf, n.d.}} It is also said that the work has also been translated into [[Vaagri Booli language|Vaagri Booli]], the language of the [[Narikurava|Narikuravas]], a tribal community in Tamil Nadu.{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 25 March 2013}} It is the most translated Tamil literature and also the most translated non-religious text of India.

===Translational difficulties===
With a highly compressed prosodic form, the Kural text employs the intricately complex ''[[Kural (poetic form)|Kural venba]]'' [[Poetic metre|metre]], known for its eminent suitability to gnomic poetry.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=166}} This form, which Zvelebil calls "a marvel of brevity and condensation," is closely connected with the structural properties of the Tamil language and has historically presented extreme difficulties to its translators.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=167}} Talking about translating the Kural into other languages, [[Herbert Arthur Popley]] observes, "it is impossible in any translation to do justice to the beauty and force of the original."{{sfn|Popley, 1931|p=x}} Zvelebil claims that it is impossible to truly appreciate the maxims found in the Kural couplets through a translation but rather that the Kural has to be read and understood in its original Tamil form.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=169}}

Besides these inherent difficulties in translating the Kural, some scholars have attempted to either read their own ideas into the Kural couplets or deliberately misinterpret the message to make it conform to their preconceived notions. The Latin translation by [[Constantius Joseph Beschi|Father Beshi]], for instance, contains several such mistranslations noticed by modern scholars. According to V. Ramasamy, "Beschi is purposely distorting the message of the original when he renders பிறவாழி as ‘the sea of miserable life’ and the phrase பிறவிப்பெருங்கடல் as ‘sea of this birth’ which has been translated by others as ‘the sea of many births’. Beschi means thus ‘those who swim the vast sea of miseries’. The concept of rebirth or many births for the same soul is contrary to Christian principle and belief."{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=33}}

==Memorials==
[[File:இலண்டன் திருவள்ளுவர்.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Valluvar at SOAS, [[University of London]].]]
The Kural text and its author have been highly venerated over the centuries. In the early 16th century, a [[Thiruvalluvar Temple|temple]] was constructed in [[Mylapore]], [[Chennai]], in honor of Valluvar. It was extensively renovated in the 1970s.{{sfn|Chakravarthy and Ramachandran, 2009}} There are also temples for Valluvar at [[Periya Kalayamputhur (Dindigul district)|Periya Kalayamputhur]], [[Thondi]], [[Kanjoor|Kanjoor Thattanpady]], [[Senapathy village (Idukki district)|Senapathy]], and [[Vilvarani (Tiruvannamalai district)|Vilvarani]].{{sfn|Vedanayagam, 2017|p=113}}

In 1976, [[Valluvar Kottam]], a monument to honor the Kural literature and its author, was constructed in [[Chennai]]. The chief element of the monument includes a 39-m-high chariot, a replica of the chariot in the temple town of [[Thiruvarur]], and it contains a life-size statue of Valluvar. All the 1,330 verses of the Kural text are inscribed on bas-relief in the corridors in the main hall.

Statues of Valluvar have been erected across the globe, including the ones at [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]], Chennai, [[Bengaluru]], [[Haridwar]], [[Puttalam]], [[Singapore]], and [[London]].{{sfn|Vedanayagam, 2017|pp=110–111}} The tallest of these is the 133-feet (40.6&amp;nbsp;m) stone [[Thiruvalluvar Statue|statue of Valluvar]] erected in 2000 atop a small island in the town of Kanyakumari on the southernmost tip of the [[Indian peninsula]], at the confluence of the [[Bay of Bengal]], the [[Arabian Sea]], and the [[Indian Ocean]].{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 2 January 2000}} This statue is currently India's 25th tallest.

==Reception==
{{main|Praise of Tirukkural}}
[[File:Valluva-nayanar.jpg|thumb|upright=0.80|right|An ancient portrait of Valluvar]]
While it has been widely acknowledged that Valluvar was of [[Jain]] origin{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}}{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} and the Kural to its most part was inspired from [[Jain philosophy|Jain]], [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu]] and other [[Ancient Indian philosophy|ancient Indian philosophies]],{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}}{{sfn|Venkataramanan, ''The Hindu'', 12 January 2018}} owing to its universality and non-denominational nature, almost every religious group in [[India]] and across the world, including [[Christianity]], has claimed the work for itself. For example, [[G. U. Pope]] speaks of the book as an "echo of the 'Sermon on the Mount.'" In the Introduction to his English translation of the Kural, Pope even claims, "I cannot feel any hesitation in saying that the Christian Scriptures were among the sources from which the poet derived his inspiration." However, the chapters on the ethics of [[moral vegetarianism]] (Chapter 26) and [[non-killing]] (Chapter 33), which the Kural emphasizes emphatically unlike the [[Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|14:3–14:29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[Abrahamic]] religious texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|5|1|end=5|style=ns|t=p}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the ethics of the Kural is rather a reflection of the [[Jain philosophy|Jaina moral code]] than of [[Christian ethics]].{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} J. M. Nallaswamy Pillai dismisses Pope’s statement as “an absurd literary anachronism,” citing the Kural text as “a stumbling block which can browbeat the most sublime ideas of Christian morality.”{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|pp=26–27}}

The Kural is praised for its universality across the globe. The ancient Tamil poet [[Avvaiyar]] observed, "Valluvar pierced an atom and injected seven seas into it and compressed it into what we have today as Kural."{{sfn|Avvaiyar|pp=Verse 55}}{{sfn| Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} The [[Russia]]n philosopher [[Alexander Piatigorsky]] called it chef d'oeuvre of both Indian and world literature "due not only to the great artistic merits of the work but also to the lofty humane ideas permeating it which are equally precious to the people all over the world, of all periods and countries."{{sfn|Pyatigorsky, n.d.|p=515}} [[G. U. Pope]] called its author "a bard of universal man."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2015|p=vi}} According to [[Albert Schweitzer]], "there hardly exists in the literature of the world a collection of maxims in which we find so much of lofty wisdom."{{sfn| Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Leo Tolstoy]] called it "the Hindu Kural,"{{sfn|Tolstoy, 1908}} and [[Mahatma Gandhi]] called it "a textbook of indispensable authority on moral life" and went on to say, "The maxims of Valluvar have touched my soul. There is none who has given such a treasure of wisdom like him."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Sir A. Grant]] said, "Humility, charity and forgiveness of injuries, being Christian qualities, are not described by Aristotle. Now these three are everywhere forcibly inculcated by the Tamil Moralist."{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=xii (Introduction)}} [[Edward Jewitt Robinson]] said that the Kural contains all things and there is nothing which it does not contain.{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} Rev. [[John Lazarus (Christian missionary)|John Lazarus]] said, "No Tamil work can ever approach the purity of the Kural. It is a standing repute to modern Tamil."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} According to [[K. M. Munshi]], "Thirukkural is a treatise par excellence on the art of living."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Sri Aurobindo]] stated, "Thirukkural is gnomic poetry, the greatest in planned conception and force of execution ever written in this kind."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Monsieur Ariel]], who translated and published the third part of the Kural to French in 1848, called it "a masterpiece of Tamil literature, one of the highest and purest expressions of human thought."{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=i (Introduction)}} According to Rev. [[Emmons E. White]], "Thirukkural is a synthesis of the best moral teachings of the world."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Rajaji]] commented, "It is the gospel of love and a code of soul-luminous life. The whole of human aspiration is epitomized in this immortal book, a book for all ages."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]], former [[President of India]], said, "Thirukkural is a treasure house of worldly knowledge, ethical guidance and spiritual wisdom."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}}

Along with [[Nalatiyar]], another work on ethics and morality from the Sangam period, the Kural is praised for its veracity. An age-old Tamil maxim has it that "[[banyan]] and [[neem]] maintain oral health; Four and Two maintain moral health," where "Four" and "Two" refer to the [[quatrains]] and [[couplets]] of Nalatiyar and the Kural, respectively.

==In popular culture==
With the rediscovery of the image of Valluvar in 1959, the portrait of the author with matted hair and a flowing beard, as drawn by artist K. R. Venugopal Sharma in 1960,{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=54–55}} was accepted by the state and central governments as the standardised version. It soon became a popular and the standard portrait of the poet.{{sfn|Parthasarathy, ''The Hindu'', 12 December 2015}} In 1964, the image was unveiled in the [[Indian Parliament]] by the then President of India [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]]. In 1967, the Tamil Nadu government passed an order stating that the image of Valluvar should be present in all government offices across the state of Tamil Nadu.{{sfn|Sharma, 2018|pp=41–42}}{{Ref label|E|e|none}}

The Kural does not appear to have been set in music by Valluvar. However, a number of musicians have set it to tune and several singers have rendered it in their concerts. Modern composers who have tuned the Kural couplets include [[Mayuram Viswanatha Sastri]] and [[Ramani Bharadwaj]]. Singers who have performed full-fledged Tirukkural concerts include [[M. M. Dandapani Desikar]] and [[Chidambaram C. S. Jayaraman]].{{sfn|Rangan, ''The Hindu'', 19 March 2016}} [[Madurai Somasundaram]] and [[Sanjay Subramanian]] are other people who have given musical rendering of the Kural. Mayuram Vishwanatha Shastri set all the verses to music in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Music Academy Conference lectures, 2017|pp=}} In January 2016, [[Chitravina N. Ravikiran]] set the entire 1330 verses to music in a record time of 16 hours.{{sfn|Rangan, ''The Hindu'', 19 March 2016}}{{sfn|''Deccan Herald'', 31 March 2018}} It can be said that it was [[Tamil cinema|cinema]] that made the general public hear Tirukkural being sung. For instance, [[K. Balachander]]'s [[Kavithalayaa Productions]] opened its films with the very first couplet of the Kural sung in the background.{{sfn|Rangan, ''The Hindu'', 19 March 2016}}

Several Tirukkural conferences were conducted in the twentieth century, most famously by [[Tirukkural V. Munusamy]] in 1941{{sfn|Periyannan, 2013|p=}} and by [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]] in 1949. The 1949 conference, headed by [[Thiru. V. Kalyanasundaram|Thiru. Vi. Ka]], [[T. P. Meenakshisundaram]], and [[A. Chakravarti]], was held for two days on 15 and 16 January, with several scholars and celebrities participating in it, including S. Somasundara Bharathi, Kandhasami Mudaliyar, Tirukkuralar Munusamy, C. Ilakkuvanar, S. Mutthaiyah Mudaliyar, K. Appadurai, Pulavar Kulandhai, Actor [[N. S. Krishnan]], and the later-day Chief Minister of the state [[C. N. Annadurai]].{{sfn|Veeramani, 2015|pp=326–348}}

In 1818, the then Collector of Madras [[Francis Whyte Ellis]], who had a high regard for Valluvar and his work, issued a gold coin bearing Valluvar's image when he was made in charge of the Madras treasury and mint.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=54–55}}{{Ref label|F|f|none}}{{Ref label|G|g|none}} In the late 19th century, the South Indian saint [[Vallalar]] launched a movement in [[Vadalur]] to teach Tirukkural to the masses.{{sfn|Kolappan, ''The Hindu'', 3 October 2018}}{{sfn|Subbaraman, 2015|pp=39–42}} In 1968, the Tamil Nadu government made it mandatory to display a Kural couplet in all government buses.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=54–55}} The train running a distance of 2,921&amp;nbsp;kilometers between Kanyakumari and [[New Delhi]] is named by the Indian Railways as the ''[[Thirukural Express]]''.{{sfn|IndianRailInfo, n.d.}} Kural also remains an integral part of the lifestyle of Tamil-speaking populations that it is propagated through various means such as music,{{sfn|Rangan, ''The Hindu'', 19 March 2016}} dance,{{sfn|Venkatasubramanian, ''The Hindu'', 26 April 2018}} street shows,{{sfn|Venkataramanan, ''The Hindu'', 22 April 2010}} recitals,{{sfn|Madhavan, ''The Hindu'', 26 August 2016}} activities,{{sfn|Ramakrishnan, ''The Hindu'', 4 September 2006}} and puzzles and riddles.{{sfn|Sujatha, ''The Hindu'', 11 July 2016}}&lt;!--Dear Fellow Editors: Add these after finding citations: drama, art, theatre, lectures, discourses, movies, media, personal chats--&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Thiruvalluvar Statue Kanyakumari.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Valluvar at Kanyakumari.]]
The Kural remains one of the most influential texts of ancient India and the chief text of the Tamil language, influencing generations of scholars at a pan-Indian expanse.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44–49}} The work had influenced people from all walks of lives, which can be inferred from the parallels found in the literatures of various languages within the Indian Subcontinent.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=50–55}} Although translations of the work into other Indian languages were not available until at least the 16th century, the work had been studied by other language scholars for centuries before the foreign invasion of India.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44–49}} With its translations into European languages starting from the early 18th century, Kural began to have a global influence. Besides numerous poets of the [[Sangam era]] including [[Avvaiyar I]] and [[Kapilar]], authors influenced by the Kural include [[Ilango Adigal]], [[Seethalai Satthanar]], [[Sekkilar]], [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Vallalar]], [[Monsieur Ariel]], [[Constantius Joseph Beschi]], [[Karl Graul]], [[August Friedrich Caemmerer]], [[Nathaniel Edward Kindersley]], [[Francis Whyte Ellis]], [[Charles E. Gover]], [[George Uglow Pope]], [[Vinoba Bhave]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]], and [[Yu Hsi]]. Many of these authors have translated the work into their languages.{{sfn|Subbaraman, 2015|pp=39–42}}{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334, 4341–4342}}

Historically, the Kural experienced a few centuries of hiatus soon after its writing, dubbed the "Dark Age," following which it enjoyed a revival period when the teachings of the Kural started to influence people greatly.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|pp=894–895}} A notable example was from the period of [[Karikalan]] during the 1st century CE, when the [[Chola dynasty|Chola ruler]] was influenced by the Kural to undertake several historically significant agricultural reforms, including reclaiming lands and building dams.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=899}} Another example was during the [[Pallava Dynasty]] when the people had to face the [[Kalabhra dynasty|Kalabhra invasion]] around 250 CE.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}}

Kural remains the only work that was honored with an exclusive work of compiled paeans in the [[Sangam literature]], authored by 55 different poets, including legendary ones.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} Kural also remains the most cited work during the [[Sangam era]] and the most quoted Tamil work ever since. Classical works such as the [[Purananuru]], [[Manimekalai]], [[Silappathikaram]], [[Periya Puranam]], and [[Kamba Ramayanam]] all cite the Kural by various names, bestowing numerous titles to the work that was originally untitled by its author.{{sfn|Jagannathan, 1963|pp=16–30}} In Kamba Ramayanam, poet [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] has used as many as 1100 couplets of the Kural.{{sfn|Desikar, 1975|pp=}}

The Kural text was first included in the school syllabus by the then [[British Raj|British government]].{{sfn|TNN, ''The Times of India'', 26 July 2017}} However, only select 275 couplets have been taught to the schoolchildren between III to XII Standards.{{sfn|Ashok, ''Live Law.in'', 1 May 2016}} Attempts to include the Kural literature as a compulsory subject in schools were ineffective in the decades following [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Independence]].{{sfn|Saravanan, ''The Times of India'', 27 April 2016}} On 26 April 2016, the [[Madras High Court]] directed the state government to include all the 108 chapters of the [[Book of Aram|Books of Aram]] and [[Book of Porul|Porul]] of the Kural text in school syllabus for classes VI through XII from the academic year 2017–2018 "to build a nation with moral values."{{sfn|Saravanan, ''The Times of India'', 27 April 2016}} The court observed, "No other philosophical or religious work has such moral and intellectual approach to problems of life."{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 27 April 2016}}

The Kural has inspired many to pursue the path of ahimsa or non-violence. [[Leo Tolstoy]] was inspired by the concept of [[non-violence]] found in the Kural when he read a [[German language|German]] version of the book, who in turn instilled the concept in [[Mahatma Gandhi]] through his [[A Letter to a Hindu]] when young Gandhi sought his guidance.{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}}{{sfn|Tolstoy, 1908}} Gandhi then took to studying the Kural in prison, which eventually culminated in his starting the non-violence movement to fight against the British.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} It is said that Gandhi had learnt Tamil only to read the original text of the Kural.{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 27 April 2016}} [[Vallalar]] was inspired by the Kural at a young age and spent his whole life promoting compassion and non-violence, emphasizing on a compassionate, non-killing, and meatless way of life.{{sfn|Subbaraman, 2015|pp=39–42}}{{sfn|Sivagnanam, 1974|p=96}}

==Notes==
{{Refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} The Kural insists on "[[moral vegetarianism]]", the doctrine that humans are morally obligated to refrain from [[Ethics of eating meat|eating meat]] or harming [[Sentience|sentient beings]],{{sfn|Parimelalhagar, 2009|pp=256–266, 314–336}} known as "veganism" since the 20th century, as described by [[Mylan Engel]] in his "The Immorality of Eating Meat" (2000).{{sfn|Engel, 2000|pp=856–889}} The concept of [[ahimsa]] or இன்னா செய்யாமை, which remains the moral foundation of veganism,{{sfn|Dinshah, 2010}} is described in the chapter on [[non-violence]] (Chapter 32).{{sfn|Parimelalhagar, 2009|pp=314–324}}

'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} The couplets are generally numbered in a linear fashion across the three books, covering all the 1,330 couplets. They can also be denoted by their chapter number and couplet number within the chapter. Thus, the third couplet in Chapter 104 ([[Agriculture]]), for instance, can be numbered either as 1033 or, less commonly, as 104:3.

'''c.''' {{Note label|C|c|none}} The Valluvar Year is obtained by adding 31 years to the present [[Gregorian year]].{{sfn|''Thiruvalluvar Ninaivu Malar'', 1935|p=117}}

'''d.''' {{Note label|D|d|none}} ''Commentary'' refers to prosaic interpretations written by various scholars for the original verse form of the Kural couplets. These commentaries are chiefly written in Tamil by pioneer writers over the millennia. In highly canonical literary works and works of poetry, such as the [[Silappathikaram]] and [[Kamba Ramayanam]], commentary can also appear in verse form, often blending with the work inseparably. ''Translation'', on the other hand, refers to any interpretation, either in prose or in verse, verbatim or otherwise, of the Kural couplets in other languages. Thus, any commentary written in a language other than Tamil is considered a prose translation of the Tamil original in that particular language.

'''e.''' {{Note label|E|e|none}} [[Government of Tamil Nadu]], G. O. Ms. 1193, dated 1967.{{sfn|Sharma, 2018|pp=41–42}}

'''f.''' {{Note label|F|f|none}} A stone inscription found on the walls of a well at the Periya Palayathamman temple at [[Royapettah|Royapettai]] indicates Ellis' regard for Valluvar. It is one of the 27 wells dug on the orders of Ellis in 1818, when Madras suffered a severe drinking water shortage. In the long inscription Ellis praises Valluvar and uses a couplet from the Tirukkural to explain his actions during the drought. When he was in charge of the Madras treasury and mint, he also issued a gold coin bearing Valluvar's image. The Tamil inscription on his grave makes note of his commentary of Tirukkural.{{sfn|Mahadevan, n.d.}}

'''g.''' {{Note label|G|g|none}} The original inscription in Tamil written in the ''asiriyapa'' [[Poetic metre|metre]] and first-person perspective: (The Kural he quotes is in italics) &lt;br /&gt; சயங்கொண்ட தொண்டிய சாணுறு நாடெனும் | ஆழியில் இழைத்த வழகுறு மாமணி | குணகடன் முதலாக குட கடலளவு | நெடுநிலம் தாழ நிமிர்ந்திடு சென்னப் | பட்டணத்து எல்லீசன் என்பவன் யானே | பண்டாரகாரிய பாரம் சுமக்கையில் | புலவர்கள் பெருமான் மயிலையம் பதியான் | தெய்வப் புலமைத் திருவள்ளுவனார் | திருக்குறள் தன்னில் திருவுளம் பற்றிய் | ''இருபுனலும் வாய்த்த மலையும் வருபுனலும்'' | ''வல்லரணும் நாட்டிற் குறுப்பு'' | என்பதின் பொருளை என்னுள் ஆய்ந்து | ஸ்வஸ்திஸ்ரீ சாலிவாகன சகாப்த வரு | ..றாச் செல்லா நின்ற | இங்கிலிசு வரு 1818ம் ஆண்டில் | பிரபவாதி வருக்கு மேற் செல்லா நின்ற | பஹுதான்ய வரு த்தில் வார திதி | நக்ஷத்திர யோக கரணம் பார்த்து | சுப திநத்தி லிதனோ டிருபத்தேழு | துரவு கண்டு புண்ணியாஹவாசநம் | பண்ணுவித்தேன்.

'''Xtampak''' (also known as '''Santa Rosa Xtampak''') is a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Campeche]].  A major town in the [[Chenes region]], it flourished during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic era]].

==History==

The name Xtampak comes from a Maya meaning "old / ancient walls". It is a very old site. The cities origins date back to 400 BC. The top of the hill has been aligned and surrounded by falling terraces intended for cultivation. The city grew by 850 years, reaching its peak of development between 550-950. It was planned and beautifully decorated, and contributed to this undoubtedly specific location of the city: it lay in a place where interacted Chenes architectural styles and     Puuc.  Thanks in Santa Rosa Xtampak find magnificent monuments showing the typical features of each of these styles. Xtampak was the historical capital of the [[Chene]] Maya people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayanbeachgarden.com/santaRosaXtampak.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The city is built on a natural elevation with a flattened and divided summit, it covers an approximate area of 9 square kilometers. Xtampak had over ten interlocked ceremonial plazas. During its golden age, the city was inhabited by 10,000 people. The buildings have a marked Chenes style, although there are some structures with a [[Puuc]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campeche.travel/en/recursos-turisticos/arqueologia-maya-2/item/santa-rosa-xtampac |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813154802/http://www.campeche.travel/en/recursos-turisticos/arqueologia-maya-2/item/santa-rosa-xtampac |archivedate=August 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monuments==

The largest structure in Xtampak is Hill Stars, a large platform with stairs. The building is made up of at least ten buildings. This is where archaeologists found eight stele, all smooth and sculpted. Xtampak was one of the few cities built by the Chenes, which erected stelae.&lt;ref&gt;http://przedkolumbem.blogspot.com/2012/08/miasta-majow-santa-rosa-xtampak-stan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==

===The Palace===
[[File:SRX02.JPG|thumbnail|left|The front of the palace]]
The three story building known as the Palace, is unquestionably the most unusual structure still standing at Xtampak. 
By any standard, this is a large and impressive building. There are twentyseven 
rooms on the ground level, twelve on the second level, including the two oneroom 
buildings at the southeast and southwest corners, and five on the third level, 
making a total of forty-four rooms in all. A broad stairway on the east side 
leads from the plaza level to a doorway in the free-standing wall at the head of the 
stairs, giving access to the open courtyard and rooms behind. There is no 
indication that this stairway would allow access to the second level nor is there any 
real indication of secondary stairways on the west side leading to the second level.
The interior stairways, starting in Rooms 6 and 10 
on the ground floor, wind up through all three levels, providing the only visible means 
of reaching the second level. At the second and third levels, these stairways open 
directly to the exterior, in contrast to the ground floor where it is necessary to pass 
through anterooms before gaining access to the stairways. 
The organization of the rooms on the ground floor is unusual since all of the 
rooms, with the exception of the three central rooms on the west side, consist of 
"suites" of two, three and four interconnected rooms. Six rooms (Rooms 3, 
15, 17, 18, 24, 26) contain beds and all of these are interior rooms.
[[File:Sta Rosa Xtampak Pal Plan.jpg|thumbnail|Floor plan of the palace]]
The four-room suites at the northern and southern ends were singled out for special attention since the outermost gallery-like rooms (Rooms 16 and 25) have sculptured panels centered between the 
doorways to the rear rooms and there are groups of three inset colonnettes on the west and east sides of these doorways. The central colonnette of both groups is covered with relief carvings. The pier-like doorjambs of the outer rooms, and presumably the central piers as well, show recessed panels and capitals with Puuc-like profiles. 
[[File:SRX03.JPG|thumbnail|left|The back of the palace]]
The rooms on the second level, which are the least accessible, are quite spacious 
and six of the eight rooms have multiple doorways, which is seemingly at odds with 
the level of privacy afforded by the restricted access system. The free 
standing rooms at the southeast and southwest corners seem almost symbolic since 
the space in front of the doorways is too narrow to allow entry from the adjacent 
terraces. The tower-like buildings on the second level, with their ornaments in stucco,
might well have carried large zoomorphic masks on their east facades, and that there 
were non-functional stairways in front, now fallen or covered with debris, creating 
modified Rio Bee style symbolic pyramid-temples similar to the variant Chenes 
forms seen at Hochob, Tabasqueno, and Dzibilnocac. 
[[File:SRX12.JPG|thumbnail|left]]
The rooms on the third level, which can be reached by means of both the interior 
stairways on the west side and the monumental stairway on the east side, seem to 
represent the ceremonial portion of the building. Both the courtyard and the room behind seem ideally suited for formal rituals involving processionals proceeding up the stairway and into a sacred precinct while the general populace watched from the plaza below. The central portion 
of the east facade may have been conceived as a symbolic pyramid-temple in which the 
monumental east stairway with its stepped ramps represent the pyramid while the 
free-standing wall on the third level, with its portal surrounded by a gigantic 
zoomorphic mask, represents the temple. The combined stairway and symbolic temple have the same steep-sided tower-like configuration 
as seen in typical Rio Bee tower forms.
In virtually every respect, the three-story Palace is a unique building which has 
no real counterparts elsewhere in the Chenes region itself. The monumental stairway 
on the east side, leading to a portal in a free-standing wall with an open court behind, 
immediately calls to mind Structure IV at Becan, however, which shows a very similar 
organization. The Palace also shows a vague similarity to the three-story Palace at [[Sayil]], although the latter is larger and lacks the open courtyard on the third 
level at the head of the main stairway. 
[[File:Palacio R.jpg|thumbnail]]
Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the Palace in Xtampak is that it appears to have been conceived at the outset as a multi-story structure, in contrast to multi-level buildings elsewhere in which the various levels were accretions over time. 
This is particularly noticeable in the Palace at Sayil, where the architectural and decorativefeatures of the facades on the various levels are considerably different. 
In contrast, the architectural and decorative features on all three levels of the Palace at Santa Rosa are virtually identical and there are only minor variations in the details of base, medial, and cornice moldings. 
The interior stair system also points to an initial three-story conception as it is difficult to see 
how these stairways could have been added at a later date. 
Several architectural features have been incorporated into this building which seem to anticipate certain elements of the classic Puuc architectural styles. These include the column-like piers creating the multiple doorways to several of the exterior rooms on all three levels.

Other unusual architectural features include the numerous recessed wall panels which are particularly prominent on the west side of the rooms on the third level. 
Because of the unquestionable palatial appearance of the building, it is tempting to accept this designation out of hand without asking for any proof. 
Unfortunately, there is little to go on in the way of hard data which has any reference to the function(s) of the various rooms. The circulation system does, however, establish a fairly clear hierarchy in terms of the degree of privacy or difficulty of entry with regard to the rooms on the several levels. The rooms on the second level are the most difficult to reach and access is easily controlled by means of the interior stair system. 
The rooms on the third level can be reached from either the interior or exterior stairways, but here again, checkpoints are provided at the points of entry. 
The outermost rooms on the ground level open directly to the plaza level and are therefore the easiest to reach and the least private. The inner rooms are well protected, however, and are well suited for more private activities.
None of the above tells us very much about the specific functions of the rooms on different levels but the obvious advantages afforded by the restrictive access system could be put to use in a variety of ways. While we will probably never know exactly how the individual rooms were used, it is impossible to imagine the Palace as anything other than an elite residential-ceremonial-administrative structure where the highest-ranking members of the ruling class at Xtampak held sway.&lt;ref&gt;http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/15500/txu-aaa-gfa00356.txt?sequence=3&lt;/ref&gt;

===The snake mouth portal===
[[File:SRX01.JPG|thumb|The snake portal]]
The snake mouth portal decorates the facade of a small room, which is located laterally in a long series of rooms. The space jumps from the series of spaces in front of more than half a meter, and thus creates the typical for the Chenes style impression of individual buildings.  The actual entrance is unusually narrow, and is three steps above the ground.  The otherwise mostly encountered platform in front of the entrance, which is pushed forward lower jaw is missing here. 
[[File:SRX13.JPG|thumbnail|Behind the snake portal]]
After the completion of the building a staircase was set on the back that leads up to the roof of the room.  There, a small room was probably built or at least planned.  In order to stabilize the roof for that extra space, the back wall was reinforced to almost half of the vault with a masonry core, which was covered on the front with stucco.  From the back of a reconstructed in its lower part staircase leads to the upper room.  It is unusual that the staircase has at its center a central stair stringer, which is designed as a tail or abdomen of the reptile, and the turn ends in a small snake throat.

In [[human genetics]], the '''Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor''' ('''Y-MRCA''', informally known as '''Y-chromosomal Adam''') is the [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA) from whom all [[Present day|currently living]] men are descended [[Patrilineality|patrilineally]]. The term Y-MRCA reflects the fact that the [[Y chromosome]]s of all currently living males are directly derived from the Y chromosome of this remote ancestor. The analogous concept of the matrilineal most recent common ancestor is known as "[[Mitochondrial Eve]]" (mt-MRCA, named for the matrilineal transmission of [[mtDNA]]), the most recent woman from whom all living humans are descended [[matrilineality|matrilineally]]. As with "Mitochondrial Eve", the title of "Y-chromosomal Adam" is not permanently fixed to a single individual, but can advance over the course of human history as paternal lineages become extinct.

Estimates of the time when Y-MRCA lived have also shifted as modern knowledge of human ancestry changes. In 2013, the discovery of a previously unknown [[Y-chromosomal haplogroup]] was announced,&lt;ref name="Mendez13"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Definition==
{{Human timeline}}
{{main article|Most recent common ancestor{{!}}MRCA}}
The Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor is the [[most recent common ancestor]] of the [[Y-chromosome]]s found in currently living human males.

Due to the definition via the "currently living" population, the identity of a MRCA, and by extension of the human Y-MRCA, is time-dependent (it depends on the moment in time intended by the term "currently").
The MRCA of a population may move forward in time as archaic lineages within the population go extinct:
once a lineage has died out, it is irretrievably lost. This mechanism can thus only shift the title of Y-MRCA forward in time. Such an event could be due to the total extinction of several basal haplogroups.&lt;ref name="ancestors_tale" /&gt;
The same holds for the concepts of matrilineal and patrilineal MRCAs: it follows from the definition of Y-MRCA that he had at least two sons who both have unbroken lineages that have survived to the present day. If the lineages of all but one of those sons die out, then the title of Y-MRCA shifts forward from the remaining son through his patrilineal descendants, until the first descendant is reached who had at least two sons who both have living, patrilineal descendants. The title of Y-MRCA is not permanently fixed to a single individual, and the Y-MRCA for any given population would himself have been part of a population which had its own, more remote, Y-MRCA.

Although the informal name "Y-chromosomal Adam" is a reference to the [[Adam|biblical Adam]], this should not be misconstrued as implying that the bearer of the chromosome was the only human male alive during his time.&lt;ref name = "Takahata93"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Takahata |first1= N |title=Allelic genealogy and human evolution |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |date=January 1993 |pmid=8450756 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a039995}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--as has sometimes been naively proposed{{whom}} based on naive association with the Genesis narrative (who has even come up with this and why does it have to be debunked in a prominent position of this article?)--&gt;
His other male contemporaries may also have descendants alive today, but not, by definition, through solely patrilineal descent; in other words, none of them have an unbroken male line of descendants (''son's son's son's … son'') connecting them to currently living people.

By the nature of the concept of most recent common ancestors, these estimates can only represent a ''[[terminus ante quem]]'' ("limit before which"), until the genome of the entire population has been examined (in this case, the genome of all living humans).

==Age estimate==
Estimates on the age of the Y-MRCA crucially depend on the most archaic known haplogroup extant in contemporary populations. {{As of|2018}}, this is  [[haplogroup A00]] (discovered in 2013). Age estimates based on this published during 2014&amp;ndash;2015 range between 160,000 and 300,000 years, compatible with the time of emergence and early dispersal of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.&lt;ref name=elhaik&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elhaik E, Tatarinova TV, Klyosov AA, Graur D |title= The ‘extremely ancient’ chromosome that isn’t: a forensic bioinformatic investigation of Albert Perry’s X-degenerate portion of the Y chromosome |journal= European Journal of Human Genetics|volume= 22|issue=9 | pages= 1111–16 |year= 2014 |pmid=24448544|doi= 10.1038/ejhg.2013.303 |pmc=4135414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bottleneck"/&gt;

===Method===
In addition to the tendency of the title of Y-MRCA to shift forward in time, the estimate of the Y-MRCA's DNA sequence, his position in the family tree, the time when he lived, and his place of origin, are all subject to future revisions.

The following events would change the estimate of who the individual designated as Y-MRCA was:
* Further sampling of Y chromosomes could uncover previously unknown divergent lineages. If this happens, Y-chromosome lineages would converge on an individual who lived further back in time.
* The discovery of additional deep rooting mutations in known lineages could lead to a rearrangement of the family tree.
* Revision of the Y-chromosome mutation rate (see below) can change the estimate of the time when he lived.

The time when Y-MRCA lived is determined by applying a [[molecular clock]] to human Y-chromosomes. In contrast to [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA), which has a short sequence of 16,000 [[base pair]]s, and mutates frequently, the Y chromosome is significantly longer at 60 million base pairs, and has a lower mutation rate. These features of the Y chromosome have slowed down the identification of its polymorphisms; as a consequence, they have reduced the accuracy of Y-chromosome mutation rate estimates.&lt;ref name="thomson"/&gt;

Methods of estimating the age of the Y-MRCA for a population of human males whose Y-chromosomes have been sequenced are based on applying the theories of [[molecular evolution]] to the [[Y chromosome]]. Unlike the [[autosomes]], the human Y-chromosome does not [[genetic recombination|recombine]] often with the [[X chromosome]] during [[meiosis]], but is usually transferred intact from father to son; however, it can recombine with the X chromosome in the pseudoautosomal regions at the ends of the Y chromosome. [[Mutation]]s occur periodically within the Y chromosome, and these mutations are passed on to males in subsequent generations.

These mutations can be used as markers to identify shared patrilineal relationships. Y chromosomes that share a specific mutation are referred to as [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|haplogroups]]. Y chromosomes within a specific haplogroup are assumed to share a common patrilineal ancestor who was the first to carry the defining mutation. (This assumption could be mistaken, as it is possible for the same mutation to occur more than once.) A family tree of Y chromosomes can be constructed, with the mutations serving as branching points along lineages. The Y-MRCA is positioned at the root of the family tree, as the Y chromosomes of all living males are descended from his Y chromosome.

Researchers can reconstruct ancestral Y chromosome DNA sequences by reversing mutated DNA segments to their original condition. The most likely original or ancestral state of a DNA sequence is determined by comparing human DNA sequences with those of a closely related species, usually non-human primates such as chimpanzees and gorillas. By reversing known mutations in a Y-chromosome lineage, a hypothetical ancestral sequence for the MRCA, Y-chromosomal Adam, can be inferred.

Determining the Y-MRCA's DNA sequence, and the time when he lived, involves identifying the human Y-chromosome lineages that are most divergent from each other—the lineages that share the fewest mutations with each other when compared to a non-human primate sequence in a [[phylogenetic tree]]. The common ancestor of the most divergent lineages is therefore the common ancestor of all lineages.

===History of estimates===
Early estimates of the age for the Y-MRCA published during the 1990s ranged between roughly 200 and 300 kya,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hammer MF |title=A recent common ancestry for human Y chromosomes |url= |journal= Nature |volume= 378 |issue= 6555 | pages=376–78 |year= 1995 |pmid= 7477371|doi=10.1038/378376a0|bibcode=1995Natur.378..376H }}

{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang W, Fu YX, Chang BH, Gu X, Jorde LB, Li WH |title= Sequence variation in ZFX introns in human populations |url= |journal= Mol Biol Evol |volume= 15|issue= 2 | pages= 138–42 |year= 1998 |pmid= 9491612|doi= 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025910}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Such estimates were later substantially revised downward, as in Thomson ''et al.'' 2000,&lt;ref name="thomson"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recent common ancestry of human Y chromosomes: Evidence from DNA sequence data |year=2000|last=Thomson|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/97/13/7360.full|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.13.6927 |journal=PNAS|first1=J.|volume=97|issue=13|pages=6927–29|pmid=10860948|pmc=34361 |displayauthors=etal  |bibcode=2000PNAS...97.6927B}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed an age of about 59,000.
This date suggested that the Y-MRCA lived about 84,000 years after his female counterpart [[mt-MRCA]] (the matrilineal most recent common ancestor), who lived 150,000–200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/999030.stm |title=Genetic 'Adam never met Eve' |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-10-30 |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This date also meant that Y-chromosomal Adam lived at a time very close to, and possibly after, the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|migration from Africa]] which is believed to have taken place 50,000–80,000 years ago.
One explanation given for this discrepancy in the time depths of patrilineal vs. matrilineal lineages was that females have a better chance of reproducing than males due to the practice of [[polygyny]]. When a male individual has several wives, he has effectively prevented other males in the community from reproducing and passing on their Y chromosomes to subsequent generations. On the other hand, polygyny does not prevent most females in a community from passing on their mitochondrial DNA to subsequent generations. This differential reproductive success of males and females can lead to fewer male lineages relative to female lineages persisting into the future. These fewer male lineages are more sensitive to drift and would most likely [[Coalescent theory|coalesce]] on a more recent common ancestor. This would potentially explain the more recent dates associated with the Y-MRCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Fundamentals of Human Evolution|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=-r7qw54okwMC&amp;pg=PA180|title=Genes, Culture and Human Evolution|last=Stone|year=2007|isbn=1-4051-3166-7|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/spring10/mcguem/psy8937/readings/cavalli2007.pdf|title=Human Evolution and Its Relevance for Genetic Epidemiology|last=Cavalli-Sforza|year=2007|doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.8.080706.092403|first1=Luigi Luca|journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|volume=8|pages=1–15|pmid=17408354}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The "hyper-recent" estimate of significantly below 100 kya was again corrected upward in studies of the early 2010s, which ranged at about 120 kya to 160 kya.
This revision was due to the discovery of additional mutations and the rearrangement of the backbone of the Y-chromosome phylogeny following the resequencing of [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup A]] lineages.&lt;ref name="cell.com"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.05.002|title=A Revised Root for the Human Y Chromosomal Phylogenetic Tree: The Origin of Patrilineal Diversity in Africa|year=2011|last1=Cruciani|first1=Fulvio|last2=Trombetta|first2=Beniamino|last3=Massaia|first3=Andrea|last4=Destro-Bisol|first4=Giovanni|last5=Sellitto|first5=Daniele|last6=Scozzari|first6=Rosaria|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=88|issue=6|pages=814–18|pmid=21601174|pmc=3113241}}

In 2013, Francalacci ''et al.'' reported the sequencing of male-specific single-nucleotide Y-chromosome polymorphisms (MSY-[[single-nucleotide polymorphisms|SNPs]]) from 1204 [[Sardinian people|Sardinian men]], which indicated an estimate of 180,000 to 200,000 years for the common origin of all humans through paternal lineage.&lt;ref name=fran&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Francalacci P, Morelli L, Angius A, Berutti R, Reinier F, Atzeni R, Pilu R, Busonero F, Maschio A, Zara I, Sanna D, Useli A, Urru MF, Marcelli M, Cusano R, Oppo M, Zoledziewska M, Pitzalis M, Deidda F, Porcu E, Poddie F, Kang HM, Lyons R, Tarrier B, Gresham JB, Li B, Tofanelli S, Alonso S, Dei M, Lai S, Mulas A, Whalen MB, Uzzau S, Jones C, Schlessinger D, Abecasis GR, Sanna S, Sidore C, Cucca F |title= Low-pass DNA sequencing of 1200 Sardinians reconstructs European Y-chromosome phylogeny |url= |journal= Science |volume=341 |issue= 6145 | pages=565–69 |year= 2013 |pmid=23908240 |pmc= 5500864 |doi= 10.1126/science.1237947|bibcode= 2013Sci...341..565F }}&lt;/ref&gt; or again as high as 180 to 200 kya.&lt;ref name=poz&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Poznik GD, Henn BM, Yee MC, Sliwerska E, Euskirchen GM, Lin AA, Snyder M, Quintana-Murci L, Kidd JM, Underhill PA, Bustamante CD |title= Sequencing Y chromosomes resolves discrepancy in time to common ancestor of males versus females |journal= Science|volume= 341|issue=6145 | pages= 562–65 |year= 2013 |pmid=23908239|doi= 10.1126/science.1237619 |pmc=4032117|bibcode= 2013Sci...341..562P }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 2013, Poznik ''et al.'' reported the Y-MRCA to have lived between 120,000 and 156,000 years ago, based on [[genome sequencing]] of 69 men from 9 different populations.
In addition, the same study estimated the age of Mitochondrial Eve to about 99,000 and 148,000 years.&lt;ref name=unive&gt;{{cite web| author=University of Michigan Health System |title= The when and where of the Y: Research on Y chromosomes uncovers new clues about human ancestry|date=1 August 2013 | url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130801142148.htm |work= ScienceDaily |publisher= |accessdate= 10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these ranges overlap for a time-range of 28,000 years (148 to 120 kya), the results of this study have been cast in terms of the possibility that "Genetic Adam and Eve may have walked on Earth at the same time" in the popular press.&lt;ref name=cann/&gt;&lt;ref name=arstechnica&gt;{{cite web |author =Rathi A|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/08/genetic-adam-and-eve-may-have-walked-on-earth-at-the-same-time/|title= Genetic Adam and Eve may have walked on Earth at the same time| date= 2 August 2013|work= ars technica |publisher= Condé Nast|accessdate= 10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement of yet another discovery of a previously unknown lineage, [[haplogroup A00]], in 2013, resulted in another shift in the estimate for the age of Y-chromosomal. Elhaik et al. (2014) dated it to between 163,900 and 260,200 years ago ([[95% confidence interval|95% CI]]).&lt;ref name=elhaik/&gt; Karmin et al. (2015) dated it to between 192,000 and 307,000 years ago ([[95% confidence interval|95% CI]]). The same study reports that non-African populations converge to a cluster of Y-MRCAs in a window close to 50kya ([[Recent African origin of modern humans|out-of-Africa migration]]), and an additional [[population bottleneck|bottleneck]] for non-African populations at about 10kya, interpreted as reflecting cultural changes increasing the variance in male reproductive success (i.e. increased [[social stratification]]) in the [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref name="bottleneck"/&gt;

==Family tree==
[[File:Haplogroup A tree.png|thumb|700px|center|The revised root of the y-chromosome family tree by Cruciani et al. 2011 compared with the family tree from Karafet et al. 2008. This has been further expanded by the discoveries published by Mendez et al. in 2013.]]

Initial sequencing (Karafet et al., 2008) of the human Y chromosome suggested that two most basal Y-chromosome lineages were [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup A]] and [[Haplogroup BT (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup BT]]. Haplogroup A is found at low frequencies in parts of Africa, but is common among certain hunter-gatherer groups. Haplogroup BT lineages represent the majority of African Y-chromosome lineages and virtually all non-African lineages.&lt;ref name="Karafet"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karafet TM, Mendez FL, Meilerman MB, Underhill PA, Zegura SL, Hammer MF |title=New binary polymorphisms reshape and increase resolution of the human Y chromosomal haplogroup tree |journal=Genome Research |year=2008 |volume=18  |pages=830–38 |doi=10.1101/gr.7172008 |url=http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/gr.7172008v1 |pmid=18385274 |issue=5 |pmc=2336805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Y-chromosomal Adam was represented as the root of these two lineages. Haplogroup A and Haplogroup BT represented the lineages of the two male descendants of Y-chromosomal Adam.

Cruciani et al. 2011, determined that the deepest split in the Y-chromosome tree was found between two previously reported subclades of Haplogroup A, rather than between Haplogroup A and Haplogroup BT.
Subclades A1b and A1a-T are now believed to descend directly from the root of the tree and now represent the lineages of Y-chromosomal Adam's two sons. The rearrangement of the Y-chromosome family tree implies that lineages classified as Haplogroup A do not necessarily form a [[monophyletic]] clade.&lt;ref name="Cruciani_2011"&gt;Fulvio Cruciani, Beniamino Trombetta, Andrea Massaia, Giovanni Destro-Biso, Daniele Sellitto y Rosaria Scozzari 2011, [http://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297%2811%2900164-9# A Revised Root for the human Y-chromosomal Phylogenetic Tree: The Origin of Patrilineal Diversity in Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; Haplogroup A therefore refers to a collection of lineages that do not possess the markers that define Haplogroup BT, though Haplogroup A includes the most distantly related Y chromosomes.

The M91 and P97 mutations distinguish Haplogroup A from Haplogroup BT. Within Haplogroup A chromosomes, the M91 marker consists of a stretch of 8 [[Thymine|T nucleobase]] units. In Haplogroup BT and [[chimpanzee]] chromosomes, this marker consists of 9 T nucleobase units. This pattern suggested that the 9T stretch of Haplogroup BT was the ancestral version and that Haplogroup A was formed by the [[Deletion (genetics)|deletion]] of one [[nucleobase]]. Haplogroups A1b and A1a were considered subclades of Haplogroup A as they both possessed the M91 with 8Ts.&lt;ref name="Karafet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruciani_2011"/&gt;

But according to Cruciani et al. 2011, the region surrounding the M91 marker is a mutational hotspot prone to recurrent mutations. It is therefore possible that the 8T stretch of Haplogroup A may be the ancestral state of M91 and the 9T of Haplogroup BT may be the derived state that arose by an [[insertion (genetics)|insertion]] of 1T. This would explain why subclades A1b and A1a-T, the deepest branches of Haplogroup A, both possess the same version of M91 with 8Ts. Furthermore, Cruciani et al. 2011 determined that the P97 marker, which is also used to identify Haplogroup A, possessed the ancestral state in Haplogroup A but the derived state in Haplogroup BT.&lt;ref name="Cruciani_2011"/&gt;

==Likely geographic origin==
{{further information|Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)}}
As current estimates on TMRCA converge with estimates for the age of [[anatomically modern human]]s
and well predate the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa]] migration, geographical origin hypotheses continue to be limited to the [[Africa|African continent]].

According to Cruciani ''et al.'' 2011, the most basal lineages have been detected in [[West Africa|West]], [[Northwest Africa|Northwest]] and [[Central Africa]], suggesting  plausibility for the Y-MRCA living in the general region of "Central-Northwest Africa".&lt;ref&gt;In a sample of 2204 African Y-chromosomes, 8 chromosomes belonged to either haplogroup A1b or A1a. Haplogroup A1a was identified in two Moroccan Berbers, one Fulbe, and one Tuareg person from Niger. Haplogroup A1b was identified in three Bakola pygmies from Southern Cameroon and one Algerian Berber. Cruciani ''et al.'' 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Scozzari ''et al.'' (2012) agreed with a plausible placement in "the north-western quadrant of the African continent" for the emergence of the A1b haplogroup.
&lt;ref&gt;"the hypothesis of an origin in the north-western quadrant of the African continent for the A1b haplogroup, and, together with recent findings of ancient Y-lineages in central-western Africa, provide new evidence regarding the geographical origin of human MSY diversity". {{cite journal|author=Scozzari R |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0049170|title=Molecular Dissection of the Basal Clades in the Human Y Chromosome Phylogenetic Tree|year=2012|editor1-last=Caramelli|editor1-first=David|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=11|pages=e49170|pmid=23145109|pmc=3492319|author-separator= |author2= Massaia A |author3= D'Atanasio E |author4= Myres NM |author5= Perego UA  |displayauthors=etal  |bibcode=2012PLoSO...749170S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 report of [[haplogroup A00]] found among the [[Mbo people (Cameroon)|Mbo people]] of western present-day [[Cameroon]] is also compatible with this picture.&lt;ref name="Mendez13"/&gt;

The revision of Y-chromosomal phylogeny since 2011 has affected estimates for the likely geographical origin of Y-MRCA as well as estimates on time depth. By the same reasoning, future discovery of presently-unknown archaic haplogroups in living people would again lead to such revisions. In particular, the possible presence of between 1% and 4% [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|Neanderthal-derived DNA]] in Eurasian genomes implies that the (unlikely) event of a discovery of a single living Eurasian male exhibiting a Neanderthal patrilineal line would immediately push back T-MRCA ("time to MRCA") to at least twice its current estimate. However, the discovery of a neanderthal Y-chromosome by Mendez ''et al''.&lt;ref name="Mendez2016"/&gt; suggests the extinction of neanderthal patrilineages, as the lineage inferred from the neanderthal sequence is outside of the range of [[anatomically modern humans|contemporary human]] genetic variation. Questions of geographical origin would become part of the debate on Neanderthal evolution from ''[[Homo erectus]]''.
