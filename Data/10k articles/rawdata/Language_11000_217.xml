'''Abdurrahim bey Asad bey oglu Hagverdiyev''' ({{lang-az|Əbdürrəhim bəy Haqverdiyev}}) (17 May 1870 – 11 December 1933) was an [[Azerbaijan]]i playwright, stage director, politician and public figure.

==Early life==
Abdurrahim bey was born in Aqbulaq village around [[Shusha]] suburb (then part of the [[Russian Empire]], now in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan) to court reporter Asad bey Hagverdiyev and his wife Tukasban, his second wife's name was Yevgeniya Osipovna she was of Polish-Tatar origin. He met her in Poland, through his Polish friends and there he married her. His mother's name was Husnujahan and she lives separate. His brother-in-law (sisters husband) was also  nobleman Mamobey Mamayev. He doesnot have any children but he was adopted of the sister's daughter Fatma xanum Malik-Abbas(the fact confirmed by the court of Azerbaijan). After losing his father, he lived with his uncle's family, and later back with his mother who had married a local official. He studied at a two-year Russian-Muslim school, then perfected his Russian at Malik-Hagnazarov's School and in 1884 enrolled in a seven-year Shusha [[Realschule]]. In his final year her was transferred to the Realschule in Tiflis. At age 14, he got acquainted with theatre for the first time by watching the adaptation of [[Mirza Fatali Akhundov]]'s play ''Khirs guldurbasan''. Upon graduating he was admitted to the [[Saint Petersburg State University of Waterway Communications|Saint Petersburg Institute of Transportation Engineering]] and attended lectures in Oriental Studies at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]] as a visiting student. During the eight-year period spent in Saint Petersburg, Hagverdiyev also excelled in [[French language|French]], which helped him to get to know traditions of the [[Western Europe]]an drama.&lt;ref name="kulturgovtr"&gt;[http://www.kultur.gov.tr/TR/Tempdosyalar/109864__ebdurrehimhaqverdiyev.pdf Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122717/http://www.kultur.gov.tr/TR/Tempdosyalar/109864__ebdurrehimhaqverdiyev.pdf |date=September 29, 2007 }}. ''Kultur.gov.tr''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary contributions and stage directing==
In 1892, Hagverdiyev wrote his first dramatical piece, a comedy entitled ''Yeyarsan gaz atini, gorarsan lazzatini''. The book was almost immediately published thanks to benevolent Muslim societies of the Russian capital. While in Saint Petersburg, Hagverdiyev wrote the first epic [[tragedy]] in the Azeri language, ''Daghilan tifag'' ("The Breaking of Unity", 1896). In 1899 he returned to Shusha and got involved in [[theatre director|theatre directing]]. Alongside he continued to write plays, namely ''Bakhtsiz javan'' ("The Unlucky Young Man", 1900) and ''Pari Jadu'' ("Nymph Magic", 1901). In 1907 he finished his historical tragedy ''Agha Mohammad Shah Qajar'', which brought him great fame. Beginning in 1906 Hagverdiyev wrote for the satirical magazine ''[[Molla Nasraddin (magazine)|Molla Nasraddin]]''. In 1908 he directed Azerbaijani composer [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]]'s opera ''Leyli and Majnun''. In 1911–1916 he lived in [[Agdam]] having dedicated himself mostly to writing fiction. In the next two years he lived and worked in Tiflis as a reporter for the local Russian-language newspaper. In the period of his activity, he also translated some Russian writers as Gogol and Ostrovsky as well as European writers Shakespeare, Molière, Schiller and others into the Azerbaijani language.&lt;ref name="kulturgovtr"/&gt;

==Political career==
In 1905 Hagverdiyev was appointed to Shusha's municipal government. In 1906 he was elected to the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]] (Russian Imperial legislative assembly) as a representative of the [[Elisabethpol Governorate]] and went off to Saint Petersburg. After its dissolution, Hagverdiyev came back to work in the insurance industry and later in a waterway transportation company. In these years, he often travelled to [[Iran]] and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="kulturgovtr"/&gt;

In 1918, Hagverdiyev, who lived in Tiflis at the time and worked as a court officer, was appointed representative of [[Azeris in Georgia (country)|Georgia's Azeri community]] in the Parliament of the newly formed [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]]. At the same time he taught at an Azeri-language secondary school in Tiflis. In 1919 he accepted the invitation by the government of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] to serve as the Azerbaijani consul in [[Dagestan]], and later in [[Democratic Republic of Armenia|Armenia]].&lt;ref name="kulturgovtr"/&gt;

After Azerbaijan's [[Sovietization]] in 1920 Hagverdiyev was appointed head of the department for theatres in the [[Narkompros|People's Commissariat for Enlightening]] (early [[USSR|Soviet]] analogy of the Ministry of Education). In 1921–1931 he worked in the Oriental Studies department of the [[Azerbaijan State University]]. In 1923–1935 he was head of the Azerbaijan Society for Scientific Research, of which he was a co-founder. In 1924 he was elected Corresponding Member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1929 he received the title of an Honoured art worker of Azerbaijan. In 1930–1932 Hagverdiyev was Chair of the [[Writers' Union of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name="kulturgovtr"/&gt; He died in Baku in 1933.

==Legacy==
Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev's 40-year-old productive career in literature was a successful continuation to the dramaturgic traditions initiated by Mirza Fatali Akhundov in the early-to-mid 19th century. In his works and articles he communicated themes like the necessity of mass [[education]] and the respect for [[human rights]] and liberties. His tragedies were true depictions of contemporary problems. Due to his education, knowledge of Western and Eastern cultures and his refined manners Hagverdiyev was widely known and loved by Azerbaijanis, setting an example to the young generation of writers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7989">In [[algebraic logic]], an '''action algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] which is both a [[residuated semilattice]] and a [[Kleene algebra]].  It adds the star or reflexive transitive closure operation of the latter to the former, while adding the left and right residuation or implication operations of the former to the latter.  Unlike [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] and other modal logics of programs, for which programs and propositions form two distinct sorts, action algebra combines the two into a single sort.  It can be thought of as a variant of [[Heyting algebra|intuitionistic logic]] with star and with a noncommutative conjunction whose identity need not be the top element.  Unlike Kleene algebras, action algebras form a [[Algebraic variety|variety]], which furthermore is finitely axiomatizable, the crucial axiom being ''a''•(''a'' → ''a'')* ≤ ''a''.  Unlike models of the equational theory of Kleene algebras (the regular expression equations), the star operation of action algebras is reflexive transitive closure in every model of the equations.

==Definition==

An '''action algebra''' (''A'', ∨, 0, •, 1, ←, →, *) is an [[algebraic structure]] such that (''A'', ∨, •, 1, ←, →) forms a [[residuated semilattice]] while (''A'', ∨, 0, •, 1, *) forms a [[Kleene algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Now Kleene algebras are axiomatized with quasiequations, that is, implications between two or more equations, whence so are action algebras when axiomatized directly in this way.  However, action algebras have the advantage that they also have an equivalent axiomatization that is purely equational.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In the following we write the inequality ''a'' ≤ ''b'' as an abbreviation for the equation ''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''b''.  This allows us to axiomatize the theory using inequalities yet still have a purely equational axiomatization when the inequalities are expanded to equalities.

The equations axiomatizing action algebra are those for a residuated semilattice, together with the following equations for star.
::: 1 ∨ ''a''*•''a''* ∨ ''a''  &amp;nbsp; ≤ &amp;nbsp; ''a''*
::: ''a''* ≤ (''a''∨''b'')*
::: (''a'' → ''a'')* &amp;nbsp; ≤ &amp;nbsp; ''a'' → ''a''

The first equation can be broken out into three equations, 1 ≤ ''a''*, ''a''*•''a''* ≤ ''a''*, and ''a'' ≤ ''a''*.  These force ''a''* to be reflexive, transitive,{{clarify|reason=These are properties of binary relations. Explain why a* can be considered as a binary relation.|date=June 2014}} and greater or equal to ''a'' respectively.  The second axiom asserts that star is monotone.  The third axiom can be written equivalently as ''a''•(''a''→''a'')* ≤ ''a'', a form which makes its role as induction more apparent.  These two axioms in conjunction with the axioms for a residuated semilattice force ''a''* to be the least reflexive transitive element of the semilattice greater or equal to ''a''.  Taking that as the definition of reflexive transitive closure of ''a'', we then have that for every element ''a'' of any action algebra, ''a''* is the reflexive transitive closure of ''a''.

The equational theory of the implication-free fragment of action algebras, those equations not containing → or ←, can be shown to coincide with the equational theory of Kleene algebras, also known as the [[regular expression]] equations.  In that sense the above axioms constitute a finite axiomatization of regular expressions.  Redko showed in 1967 that these equations had no finite axiomatization, for which [[John Horton Conway]] gave a shorter proof in 1971.  Salomaa gave an equation schema axiomatizing this theory which Kozen subsequently reformulated as a finite axiomatization using quasiequations or implications between equations, the crucial quasiequations being those of induction: if ''x''•''a'' ≤ ''x'' then ''x''•''a''* ≤ ''x'', and if ''a''•''x'' ≤ ''x'' then ''a''*•''x'' ≤ ''x''.  Kozen defined a Kleene algebra to be any model of this finite axiomatization.

Conway showed that the equational theory of regular expressions admit models in which ''a''* was not the reflexive transitive closure of ''a'', by giving a four-element model 0 ≤ 1 ≤ ''a'' ≤ ''a''* in which ''a''•''a'' = ''a''.  In Conway's model, ''a'' is reflexive and transitive, whence its reflexive transitive closure should be ''a''.  However the regular expressions do not enforce this, allowing ''a''* to be strictly greater than ''a''.  Such anomalous behavior is not possible in an action algebra.

==Examples==
Any [[Heyting algebra]] (and hence any [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]) is made an action algebra by taking • to be ∧ and ''a''* = 1.  This is necessary and sufficient for star because the top element 1 of a Heyting algebra is its only reflexive element, and is transitive as well as greater or equal to every element of the algebra.

The set 2&lt;sup&gt;Σ*&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[formal language]]s (sets of finite strings) over an alphabet Σ forms an action algebra with 0 as the empty set, 1 = {ε}, ∨ as union, • as concatenation, ''L''←''M'' as the set of all strings ''x'' such that ''xM'' ⊆ ''L'' (and dually for ''M''→''L''), and ''L''* as the set of all strings of strings in ''L'' (Kleene closure).

The set 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; of all binary relations on a set ''X'' forms an action algebra with 0 as the empty relation, 1 as the identity relation or equality, ∨ as union, • as relation composition, ''R''←''S'' as the relation consisting of all pairs (''x,y'') such that for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''ySz'' implies ''xRz'' (and dually for ''S''→''R''), and ''R*'' as the reflexive transitive closure of ''R'', defined as the union over all relations ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for integers ''n'' ≥ 0.

The two preceding examples are power sets, which are [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebras]] under the usual set theoretic operations of union, intersection, and complement.  This justifies calling them '''Boolean action algebras'''.  The relational example constitutes a [[relation algebra]] equipped with an operation of reflexive transitive closure.  Note that every Boolean algebra is a Heyting algebra and therefore an action algebra by virtue of being an instance of the first example.

'''Alfenus Varus''' was an ancient Roman jurist and writer who lived around the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Long | first = George | authorlink = George Long (scholar) | title = Varus, Alfenus | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 3 | pages = 1228–1229 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;q1=demosthenes;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Alfenus Varus (whose [[praenomen]] might have been Publius) was a pupil of [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]], and the only pupil of Servius from whom there are any excerpts in the ''[[Pandects]]''.  Nothing is known about him except from a story preserved by the [[scholiast]] [[Helenius Acron]], in his notes on the [[Horace#Satires|satires]] of [[Horace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''[[Horace#Satires|Satires]]'' i. 3. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  The scholiast assumes the "Alfenus Vafer" of Horace to be the lawyer, and says that he was a native of [[Cremona]], where he carried on the trade of a barber  or a [[wiktionary:botcher|botcher]] of shoes,&lt;ref&gt;Both readings are present, the Latin ''tonsor'' and ''sutor''&lt;/ref&gt; that he came to Rome to become a student of Servius, attained the dignity of [[Roman consul|consulship]], and was honored with a public funeral.

[[Pomponius]] also states that Varus attained consulship, but this will not prove the rest of the scholiast's story to be true.  The Publius Alfenius Varus who was consul in 2 AD can hardly be the pupil of Servius; and it is conjectured that he may have been the jurist's son.  It is impossible to determine what credit is due to the scholiast on Horace: he must have found the story somewhere, or have invented it.  Indeed, he and other scholiasts do sometimes favor us with a commentary which tells us nothing more than the text.  The fact of an Alfenus being a native of Cremona, and of an Alfenus having been a pupil of Servius, and a learned jurist, and of an Alfenus having been consul, is quite enough to enable a scholiast with the assistance of the passage in Horace to fabricate the whole story of Alfenus, as he has given it.

==Works==
There are 54 excerpts in the ''[[Pandects]]'' from the 40 books of the ''Digesta'' of Alfenus; but it is conjectured that Alfenus may have acted only as the editor of the work of Servius.  It appears from the fragments of Alfenus that he was acquainted with the [[Ancient Greek|Greek language]], and these fragments show that he wrote in a pure and perspicuous style.  A passage that appears in the ''Pandects'' shows that he was not a stranger to the speculations of the philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pandects]]'' 5. tit. 1. s. 76&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Aulus Gellius]], Alfenus was somewhat curious in matters of antiquity, and Gellius quotes a passage from the thirty-fourth book of his Digest in which Alfenus mentions one of the terms of a treaty between the Romans and the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], vii. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Alfenus is often cited by later jurists.  The fragments in the ''[[Pandects]]'' are taken from the second to the seventh books of the Digest and there are fragments from the eighth book taken from the [[epitome]] by the jurist [[Paulus (jurist)|Paulus]].  The entire number of books appears from the Florentine Index; the passage in Gellius quotes the thirty-fourth book; and a passage of Paulus cites the forty-ninth book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paulus (jurist)|Paulus]], Dig. 3. tit. 3. s. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the epitome of Paulus went further than the eighth book or not, is uncertain.

The passage in Gellius: "''Alfenus ... in libro Digestorum trigesimo et quarto, Conjectaneorum&lt;ref&gt;''Conlectaneorum'' is perhaps the better reading&lt;/ref&gt; autem secundo''," ("Alfenus says in the Digest and in the Conlectanea") &amp;c., has given rise to some discussion.  It is clear that the passage in the Conlectanea is attributed to Alfenus, and it is also clear that only one passage is meant; or at most the same passage is referred to as being in two different works.  But apparently only one work is meant, and therefore we must conclude that the ''Digesta'', which consisted of forty books, contained a subdivision called the Conlectanea.  Some critics have conjectured that the Conlectanea is the compilation of [[Aufidius Namusa]], so that the passage cited by Gellius appeared in both the original work by Alfenus, and in the copious compilation of Namusa, which is made from Alfenus and other pupils of Servius.&lt;ref&gt;Grotius, ''Vitae Jurisconsult.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Puchta]], ''Kursus der Institutionen'' i. 428.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmern, ''Geschichte des Röm. Privatrechts'' i. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alois Carigiet''' (30 August 1902 &amp;ndash; 1 August 1985) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[graphic designer]], [[Painting|painter]], and [[illustrator]]. He may be known best for six children's [[picture books]] set in the [[Alps]], ''[[A Bell for Ursli]]'' and its sequels, written by [[Selina Chönz]], and three that he wrote himself. In 1966 he received the inaugural [[Hans Christian Andersen Medal]] for children's illustrators.&lt;ref name=andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibby-carigiet/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and education (1902 &amp;ndash; 1923)===

Alois Carigiet was the seventh of eleven children born to Alois Carigiet and Barbara Maria Carigiet, ''née'' Lombriser; the actor and comedian [[Zarli Carigiet]] was one younger brother. It was a farm family in [[Trun, Switzerland|Trun]] in the canton of [[Graubünden]], where he grew up and spent his first school years. At home, the family spoke ''Sursilvan'', the local [[Romansh language|Romansh]] dialect of the anterior [[Rhine]] valley.&lt;ref&gt;Hansjakob Diggelmann, "Alois Carigiet: Leben und Werk", Von Arx &amp; Schnyder (1992), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, economic hardship forced them to move to the canton's German-speaking capital [[Chur]] where his father found employment. This relocation into a more urban environment had a strong impact on the nine-year-old. In retrospect, Carigiet described the move as an "emigration to the low-lands", from a "mountain boy's paradise" to a "gloomy apartment on the ground floor in a narrow town alley".&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carigiet visited primary and secondary schools in Chur, as well as the "Kantonsschule", the canton's [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], which he quit in 1918 in order to start an apprenticeship as a decorative designer and draftsman with master painter Martin Räth. While learning the art of [[graining]], [[marbleizing]], [[gold plating]] and other techniques of [[decorative art]] in Räth's atelier, Carigiet spent a lot of his spare time filling volumes of sketchbooks with drawings of rural and urban scenes, farm animals and pets, anatomical studies of heads and beaks of the birds exhibited at Chur's natural history museum, as well as with numerous caricatures of his acquaintances and family. Räth noticed the apprentice's talent as well, and one of Carigiet's appointed creations, an assembly of decorated vases for the Siebler &amp; Co. shop windows, seems to have received particular appreciation. Carigiet finished his apprenticeship in 1923, with the highest grade in every subject.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic design in Zurich (1923 &amp;ndash; 1939)===
After having completed his apprenticeship, Carigiet sought work in [[Zurich]] and started a job as a practical trainee with Max Dalang's advertisement agency in 1923, where he soon learned the techniques of [[graphic design]] and was hired as a regular employee. After having won several competitions and having gained a reputation, Carigiet opened his own graphic atelier in Zurich in 1927, employing up to six people at times, due to the constantly large volume of orders his business received. Carigiet created numerous commercial and political advertisement [[posters]], festive decorations, educational posters and [[mural]]s for schools, illustrations and satirical caricatures for the print media, as well as magazine covers for periodicals such as ''Schweizer Spiegel'' and ''SBB-Revue''.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, p. 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Important work in the 1930s included a [[diorama]] for the Swiss Pavilion at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|Paris International world fair]] in 1937, and set designs, murals and the official posters for the "Landi", the Swiss national exposition held in Zurich in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic development===
Though he had never studied visual arts in the academic sense, Carigiet's early graphic design was already strongly influenced by contemporary artists, such as [[El Lissitzky]], whose use of photomontage in a poster announcing the exhibition of Russian avant-garde artists in Zurich, in 1928, inspired the design of a political campaign poster for Zurich's mayor [[Emil Klöti]].&lt;ref&gt;Therese Bhattacharya-Stettler, "Alois Carigiet als Gebrauchsgraphiker", Von Arx &amp; Schnyder (1992), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1930s Carigiet traveled to [[Paris]], [[Munich]], [[Vienna]], and [[Salzburg]] where he became acquainted with the art movement ''[[Neue Sachlichkeit]]'', as reflected in painted scenes of Paris in ''Das rote Haus am Montmartre'' ([[watercolor]]) and of [[Ascona]] in ''Haus und Garten in Ascona'' ([[oil painting]] on cardboard), both created in 1935. Contemporary [[expressionism]] had an influence on his work as well, including his commercial artwork. For example, the display of red horses and a green cow on posters for the [[OLMA]], Switzerland’s annual national agricultural fair, in 1946 and 1952 received acclaim from art critics and questions from more conservative farmers, to which he succinctly replied that the cow was green because it had eaten grass.
Carigiet's paintings increasingly depicted everyday motifs from his home canton Graubünden and occasionally Zurich, but also from further trips to France, Spain, and [[Lapland, Sweden|Lapland]] in the mid-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carigiet always held a keen interest in the theatre, and had already worked in [[costume design]] in the late 1920s. With the help of art critic Jakob Rudolf Welti, he was commissioned as costume and [[stage designer]] for the Stadttheater Zürich performance of ''[[La belle Hélène]]'' in an adaptation by [[Max Werner Lenz]], and created design work for three other programs at the Stadttheater as well. Carigiet was one of the founding members of the influential [[Cabaret Cornichon]], a satirical cabaret program staged in the restaurant "zum Hirschen" in Zurich which would become one of the most significant political cabarets of German-speaking Switzerland during Germany's [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. Carigiet designed the Cabaret's logo, a grinning cornichon ([[gherkin]]) with a carrot-nose, and from 1935 to 1946 he created often parodistic costume and set designs for ten of the Cornichon’s programs, including a heavily decorated [[barrel organ]] used by his brother Zarli who was also a member of the Cabaret's ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diggelmann, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Platenga (1939 &amp;ndash; 1950)===
While spending a holiday in Trun in May 1939, Carigiet hiked to "Platenga", a hamlet on one of the terraces in the community of [[Obersaxen]], where, in his own words, he was immediately fascinated by the landscape's vastness and untouchedness  and the feeling of a newly found, long lost paradise.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave up his business in Zurich, and, in October 1939, rented a small farm house without electricity or running water, the "Hüs am Bach" ("house at the stream") in Platenga. Carigiet wished to dedicate his life to art and observation, spending hours a day, equipped with a pair of binoculars and a sketch book, tracking down the alpine fauna.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 1943, Carigiet married Berta Carolina Müller (1911–1980) an art student from [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] whom he had met in Germany. After their first daughter was born in 1944, they bought land near Platenga's chapel. In 1945 Carigiet designed plans for a larger house which was built in 1946. In 1947, the second daughter was born in the new house, called "Im Sunnefang". Mainly for the sake of the girls' education, the family moved back to Zurich in 1950, where Carigiet took up his work as a graphic designer again, while also continuing his artistic pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, pp. 25–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's books===
In 1940, Carigiet was approached by the [[Romansh language|Romansh]]-speaking author [[Selina Chönz]] who asked him to illustrate her story "Uorsin" to create a children's picture book. After several years of hesitating, Carigiet finally agreed, and spent several weeks sketching the scenery and architecture in [[Guarda, Switzerland|Guarda]], Chönz's home village in the [[Engadin|Lower Engadin]], after which he modeled the protagonist's village. In October 1945 the book was published in German as ''Uorsin (Schellen-Ursli. Ein Engadiner Bilderbuch)'' and later in English as ''A Bell for Ursli'' (1950). The story follows the boy Ursli's perilous climb through snow to an abandoned summer hut in order to retrieve a large ''[[trychel]]'' for the annual [[Chalandamarz]] celebration on 1 March. The book has been translated into ten languages with total sales estimated around 1.7 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, p. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Carigiet's dramatic and colorful compositions were noticed and positively reviewed by art critics including Manuel Gasser in ''[[Graphis Inc.]]'' or Linus Birchler, editor-in-chief of the series ''[[Society for Art History in Switzerland|Art Monuments of Switzerland]]'' and member of the Swiss Federal Art Commission.

Carigiet and Chönz created a series of Alpine children's books with two sequels featuring Ursli's younger sister: ''Flurina (Flurina und das Wildvögelein. Schellen-Ursli's Schwester)'' in 1952 (English title: ''Florina and the Wild Bird'') and ''La naivera (Der grosse Schnee)'' in 1957 (''The Snowstorm''). In the 1960s, Carigiet continued on his own, illustrating ''and'' writing ''Zottel, Zick und Zwerg. Eine Geschichte von drei Geissen'' in 1965 (''Anton the Goatherd''), ''Birnbaum, Birke, Berberitze. Eine Geschichte aus den Bündner Bergen'' in 1967 (''The Pear Tree, the Birch Tree and the Barberry Bush''), and ''Maurus und Madleina. Über den Berg in die Stadt'' in 1969 (''Anton and Anne''). In 1966, he was awarded the Schweizer Jugendbuchpreis (Swiss youth book prize) for ''Zottel, Zick und Zwerg''.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, pp. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The biennial [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]], conferred by the [[International Board on Books for Young People]] and first awarded in 1956, is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. Carigiet received the inaugural Illustrator award in 1966.&lt;ref name=andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibby-carigiet/&gt;

===Later life (1960 &amp;ndash; 1985)===
In 1960, Carigiet bought the house "Flutginas" (ferns) located above Trun, his village of childhood, where he would spend the rest of his life dedicated to painting. In a speech held in Zurich in 1962, he described his works as "narrative art" in a century of abstraction, and named [[Georges Rouault]], "the greatest of all", as an exemplary inspiration for his artistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Alois Carigiet, "Alois Carigiet über sich selbst – Auszüge aus einer Rede", Von Arx &amp; Schnyder (1992), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1982, he frequently exhibited his artwork in Switzerland, but also in [[Toronto]] (1969) and [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] (1971). Alois Carigiet died on 1 August  1985 in Trun.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diggelmann, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became most notable for allegedly predicting the [[September 11 attacks]] when, in December 2000, he said that he foresees a "cataclysmic cosmic event" the following year and to "Watch for a sign in the heavens.

[[File:Danny_Gabbidon_1.png|thumb|120px|[[Danny Gabbidon]] wearing a [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] away kit, 2012]]

'''Away colours''' are a choice of coloured clothing used in [[team sport]]s. They are required to be worn by one team during a game between teams that would otherwise wear the same colours as each other, or similar colours. This change prevents confusion for officials, players, and spectators. In most sports, it is the [[road (sports)|visiting or road team]] that must change – second-choice kits are commonly known as '''away kits''' or '''change kits''' in [[British English]], and '''road uniforms''' in [[List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom|American English]].

Some sports leagues mandate that away teams must always wear an alternative kit, while others simply state that the two teams' colours should not match. In some sports, conventionally the ''home'' team has changed its kit (such as in [[rugby union]]).

In most cases, a team wears its away kit only when its primary kit would clash with the colours of the home team. However, sometimes teams wear away colours by choice, occasionally even in a home game. At some clubs, the away kit has become more popular than the home version. Replica home and away kits are usually available for fans to buy. Some teams also have produced [[third jersey|third-choice kits]], or even old-fashioned [[throwback uniform]]s.

Most teams choose to wear their colour jerseys at home, with the road team changing to white in most cases.&lt;ref name="CVC"/&gt; White road uniforms gained prominence with the rise of television in the 1950s. A "white vs. color" game was easier to follow in [[black-and-white]].&lt;ref name="CVC"/&gt; According to Phil Hecken, "until the mid 1950′s, not only was color versus color common in the NFL, it was actually the norm."&lt;ref name="CVC"/&gt; Even long after the advent of colour television, the use of white jerseys has remained in almost every game.

The NFL's current rules require that a team's home jerseys must be "either white or official team color" throughout the season, "and visiting clubs must wear the opposite".&lt;ref name="NFL26"&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 4: Equipment, Uniforms, Player Appearance|url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/rulebook/pdfs/8_Rule5_Players_Subs_Equip_GeneralRules.pdf#page=4|publisher=National Football League|date=August 29, 2012|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a team insists on wearing its home uniforms on the road, the [[History of the NFL Commissioner|NFL Commissioner]] must judge on whether their uniforms are "of sufficient contrast" with those of their opponents.&lt;ref name="NFL26"/&gt; The road team might instead wear a [[third jersey]], such as the [[Seattle Seahawks]]' "Wolf Grey" alternate.

Until 1964 Dallas had worn blue at home, but it was not an official rule that teams should wear their coloured jerseys at home.

In 2007, they wore a white throwback jersey.

The Dallas Cowboys' blue jersey has been popularly viewed to be "[[sports-related curses|jinxed]]" because of defeats at [[Super Bowl V]] in 1971 (when they were forced to wear their blue jerseys as the designated 'home' team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lukas |first=Paul |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/071025 |title=ESPN Page 2 – Uni Watch: How 'bout them Cowboys? |publisher=ESPN |date=October 26, 2007 |accessdate=November 28, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712070016/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas%2F071025 |archivedate=July 12, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and in the [[1968 NFL playoffs|1968 divisional playoffs]] at Cleveland, [[Don Meredith]]'s final game as a Cowboys player. Dallas's only victory in a conference championship or Super Bowl wearing the blue jerseys was in the [[1978–79 NFL playoffs|1978 NFC Championship game]] at the Los Angeles Rams.

[[Super Bowl]] rules later changed to allow the [[Super Bowl#Home team designation|designated home team]] to pick their choice of jersey. White was chosen by the Cowboys ([[Super Bowl XIII|XIII]], [[Super Bowl XXVII|XXVII]]), the Redskins ([[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]]), the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] ([[Super Bowl XL|XL]]), the [[Denver Broncos]] ([[Super Bowl 50|50]]), and the [[New England Patriots]] ([[Super Bowl LII|LII]]).&lt;ref name="Denv50"&gt;{{cite news|last=Swanson|first=Ben|title=Broncos to wear white uniforms in Super Bowl 50|url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-to-wear-white-uniforms-in-Super-Bowl-50/26a247f5-91ef-4ff6-a11a-8278b089c5c3|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=January 25, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126222617/http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-to-wear-white-uniforms-in-Super-Bowl-50/26a247f5-91ef-4ff6-a11a-8278b089c5c3|archivedate=January 26, 2016|accessdate=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter three teams normally wear colours at home, but Pittsburgh had worn white in [[2005–06 NFL playoffs|three road playoff wins]], while Denver cited its previous Super Bowl success in white jerseys ([[Super Bowl XXXIII|XXXIII]]), while being 0–4 when wearing orange in Super Bowls.

While they had only done so twice, both to "jinx" Dallas, during the 21 years they played in St. Louis, since [[History of the Los Angeles Rams|returning to Los Angeles]] in 2016, the Rams, temporarily playing in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|same stadium]] as they had in the 1960s, have worn white at home as a conscious tribute to the highly successful teams of that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=3k|title=

While a team's primary kit rarely undergoes major changes, the second colours tend to vary over time and sometimes by tournament. Some away kits are a modification of the home colours (for example a reversal of primary and secondary colours), other away kits are considerably different from home kits. Several club and national sides have favourite away colours which might remain the same more or less continuously. Often these are colours that were used in famous victories; for instance [[A.C. Milan]] (white) and Brazil (blue).  Many professional clubs also have an official [[Third jersey|third kit]], ostensibly to be used if both their first-choice and away colours are deemed too similar to those of an opponent.&lt;ref name="HFK" /&gt;

It is not unknown for teams to opt to wear their away colours even when not required to by a clash of colours. [[England national football team|England]] sometimes play in red shirts even when not required, as the team wore red when it won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] held on home soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamUnif/Unif.html |title=England's Uniforms – Player Kits |publisher=England Football Online |author=Glen Isherwood |accessdate=23 January 2008 |quote=England sometimes choose to wear their red at home even though they could wear their white, as against Germany in the last match played at Wembley Stadium.

In some title-deciding matches, a team has won the game wearing its away kit, but changed to home shirts for the trophy presentation – most notably when [[Spain national football team|Spain]] won the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|2010 World Cup final]] in their dark-blue away kit, but changed to red home shirts to lift the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aolnews.com/2010/07/11/spain-wins-2010-world-cup/ "Spain Wins 2010 World Cup"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812060314/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/07/11/spain-wins-2010-world-cup/ |date=2012-08-12 }}, [[AOL]] News, July 11, 2010. Retrieved July 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases both teams have been forced to wear their second choice away kits; such as the match between Netherlands and Brazil in the [[1974_FIFA_World_Cup#Second_round|1974 FIFA World Cup]] where they wore white and dark blue rather than their first choice of orange and yellow, respectively; and the match between Netherlands and Spain in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group B|2014 FIFA World Cup]] where they wore dark blue and white (Spain's third choice colors) rather than their home colors of orange and red, respectively. During the [[1998-99 UEFA Champions League]], [[1998–99 Manchester United F.C. season|Manchester United F.C.]] had to wear their away colors in both of their group stage matches against [[F.C. Barcelona]], not just away at [[Camp Nou]] but also home at [[Old Trafford]] too.

===History in English football===
In England in 1890, [[English Football League|the Football League]], which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, so as to avoid clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available.&lt;ref name="HFK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Articles/History.htm|title=A Brief History of Football Kit Design in England and Scotland|author=David Moor|accessdate=14 January 2008|publisher=HistoricalFootballKits.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118075657/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Articles/History.htm|archivedate=18 January 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the home team was required to change colours in the event of a clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.&lt;ref name="Enc2"&gt;{{cite book

Host teams typically wear home colours for the duration of the tournament, for instance Germany played every game at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in its home white colours while the away colours (changed from black to red at the request of then-manager [[Jürgen Klinsmann]] in 2005) never made an appearance on the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/0,1518,398580,00.html |title=Traditionstrikot vor dem Aus&amp;nbsp;– Klinsmann steht auf Rot |language=German |author=Jürgen Zulu Tek, Thomas Niklaus / sid |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=1 February 2006 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been some exceptions, however, as England wore their away red colours in the 1966 World Cup Final, while in 2018 Russia wore their away white colours against Uruguay and Spain.

===Major League Baseball===
{{see also|Baseball uniforms|Major League Baseball uniforms}}
Originally, Major League Baseball teams were primarily distinguished by the colours of their stockings. In 1882, the National League assigned different stocking colours to the member clubs; the league also assigned [[jersey (clothing)#In sports|jersey]] and cap colours, but by [[position player|player position]] rather than by club.

The Cincinnati Reds were known as the "Red Legs" and "Red Stockings" during the early 1900s.

[[File:Tampa Catholic High School baseball road uniform.jpg|thumb|The road uniform of [[Tampa Catholic High School]], [[Florida]]]]
By the end of the 19th century, it became common for teams to wear white at home, and grey in road games. Some teams used road uniforms of solid dark blue or black.&lt;ref name="baseball-almanac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/uniforms.shtml|title=Baseball Uniforms of the 20th Century by Baseball Almanac|publisher=[[Baseball Almanac]]|accessdate=2008-05-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509195105/http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/uniforms.shtml|archivedate=2008-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of this is the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Superbas]], who started to use a blue pattern for their road uniforms in 1907.&lt;ref name="baseball-almanac"/&gt; Both the home and away teams' uniforms also contained trim in the team colours.

In 1916, on the [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]]' road uniforms, purple lines gave their uniforms a [[tartan]]-like effect and another kind of road uniform was a solid dark blue or black material with white around this time. The [[Kansas City Athletics]] home and road uniforms were changed by [[Charles O. Finley]] in 1963, to the colours of gold and green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917734-7,00.html|title=Charlie Finley: Baseball's Barnum|publisher=Time|date=August 18, 1975|accessdate=2008-06-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012202104/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917734-7,00.html|archivedate=October 12, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some teams used powder blue for their road uniforms from the 1970s to the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="baseball-almanac"/&gt;

Aside from the obvious need to distinguish one team from the other, conventional wisdom held that it was more difficult to properly launder uniforms while on a [[road (sports)|road]] trip, thus the "road grays" helped to hide accumulated soil. This convention continued well after its original premise was nullified by the issuance of multiple uniforms and the growth of the [[laundromat]] industry.

Typically, home uniforms feature the team's nickname, while away uniforms feature the name of the team's geographic designation; there are ten teams that are exceptions to this rules: the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], [[Los Angeles Angels]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[Milwaukee Brewers]], [[Washington Nationals]], [[Miami Marlins]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[New York Yankees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/19249734/examining-teams-buck-mlb-home-road-uniform-trend|first=Paul|last=Lukas|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=April 28, 2017|language=English|title=Breaking down MLB's jersey name game|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428004429/http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/19249734/examining-teams-buck-mlb-home-road-uniform-trend|archivedate=April 28, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tigers, Nationals and Yankees all wear their cap insignia on the left breast of their home jerseys, but the city name on their away jerseys.  

In addition to this, some teams have featured mainly their team's location presented on their uniforms both at home and on the road. Examples include the Rangers and Marlins, whose alternate orange jersey is the only one of the team's four to feature the nickname instead of the city name.  Some teams have alternate home uniforms featuring location such as the [[Colorado Rockies]] and St. Louis Cardinals. The Brewers have worn a navy jersey with "Milwaukee" on the front frequently both at home and on the road since 2015, while the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] have worn an alternate grey jersey with the nickname instead of the city name for most away games since 2014. 

From 1973 to 2008, the [[Baltimore Orioles]] were part of this group – the omission of the city's name being part of a largely successful effort to attract fans from the Washington, D.C. area – before returning "Baltimore" to the road jerseys in 2009, by which time their neighbour 35 miles (55&amp;nbsp;km) to the south once again had a team of its own.

Until the [[2017–18 NBA season|2017–18 season]], the rules of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) stated: "The home team shall wear light color jerseys, and the visitors dark jerseys unless otherwise approved.

But, according to this rule, road uniforms are required at every game in the NBA.

In [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[college basketball]], the home team almost universally wears white uniforms, while the visiting team wears colours.

==Hockey==

===National Hockey League===
{{see also|NHL uniform}}
In the NHL each team is currently required to have two uniform designs: one with a white base (or sometimes historically, a light colour), and one with a darker-coloured base. From the 1970–71 season to the 2002–03 season, NHL teams wore lighter colours or white at home and the darker colours on the road. When the Third Jersey Program was introduced in the 1995–96 season, some teams wore third jerseys at home, thus requiring the road team to wear the white. This problem was rectified at the start of the 2003–04 season, as NHL teams started to wear the dark colour at home and the white for road games; there are occasional single-game exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coyotes.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=337397&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page Phoenix Coyotes 2007-08 "Reverse Jersey Nights"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315113028/http://coyotes.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=337397&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page |date=March 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kings.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=31734 Los Angeles Kings Uniform History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512200754/http://kings.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=31734 |date=2009-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only element allowed by NHL rules to be interchangeable between the two uniforms is the pants.

In the minor leagues, teams historically wore white or light colours at home and dark colours on the road.

==Netball==
Away colours are used by [[Jamaica national netball team|Jamaica]] and [[Australia national netball team|Australia]], two top international teams who both have yellow home kits. Jamaica's change kit is all-black, Australia's is all-green. When the teams meet, one usually changes its kits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johannah Curran, Australia v Jamaica World|url=http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Johannah+Curran+Australia+v+Jamaica+World+GbJx9TJqFILl.jpg|website=Zimbio.com|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914070608/http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Johannah+Curran+Australia+v+Jamaica+World+GbJx9TJqFILl.jpg|archivedate=14 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 World Netball Series – Day One – Verity Simmons, Sasha Lynch|url=http://isiphotos.photoshelter.com/image/I0000oH3ksK1myRE|website=ISI Photos|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914070710/http://isiphotos.photoshelter.com/image/I0000oH3ksK1myRE|archivedate=14 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia through to gold medal match against New Zealand, August 3, 2014|url=http://netball.com.au/news/australia-through-to-gold-medal-match-against-new-zealand/|website=Netball.com.au|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317130413/http://netball.com.au/news/australia-through-to-gold-medal-match-against-new-zealand/|archivedate=17 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there have been games such as a 2011 Test where each team wore predominantly yellow, with Jamaica in black skirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia v Jamaica Game One|url=http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Australia+v+Jamaica+Game+One+OI9WrIMm2nnl.jpg|website=Zimbio.com|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914075504/http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Australia+v+Jamaica+Game+One+OI9WrIMm2nnl.jpg|archivedate=14 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate colours are also used where required in the Australasian [[ANZ Championship]].

==Rugby union==
It is traditional in rugby (as it was in soccer prior to 1921) for the home team to change in the event of a clash. This stems partly from teams touring overseas; it was easier for the home side to get an alternate kit. The [[World Rugby]] rules for tours do not state this outright: it is the responsibility of the WR CEO or representative "to resolve the matter", but "in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the Host Union shall be entitled to wear its home kit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IRB Handbook Online|url=http://www.irb.com/imgml/IRB/irbhandbook/IRB_Handbook_Online_EN/index.html#/228/|accessdate=3 June 2014|ref=Page 230, regulation 15.18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606224804/http://www.irb.com/imgml/IRB/irbhandbook/IRB_Handbook_Online_EN/index.html#/228/|archivedate=2014-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] [[English rugby union system|level 3 to 5]] competition, if there is a clash the away team must change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RFU Regulation 13.6.3: Kit, Clash of colours|url=http://www.rfu.com/~/media/files/thegame/regulations/rfu_regulation_13_2013|website=RFU.com|publisher=Rugby Football Union|accessdate=3 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011000448/http://www.rfu.com/~/media/files/thegame/regulations/rfu_regulation_13_2013|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Rugby World Cup]]s, colour clashes are decided by a [[coin-toss]] for first choice of kits. In the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]] quarter-final between [[France national rugby union team|France]] and [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], the recently redesigned French kit was dark blue and black, and clashed with the All Blacks' kit.&lt;ref name="Frenchleave"/&gt; The toss went in favour of France, and New Zealand wore silver shirts in the game in [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref name="Englandblackstuff"/&gt; However, in the [[2011 Rugby World Cup Final]] between those teams, France won the toss and chose to play in its white away kit. France's team manager [[Jo Maso]] said this decision was because of "the welcome they’d received from the people of New Zealand, the faultless organisation of the tournament and the honour and pleasure of playing... [at] [[Eden Park]]".&lt;ref name="Frenchleave"&gt;{{cite news|title=N. Zealand granted French leave for All Black final|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111018/rugby/N-Zealand-granted-French-leave-for-All-Black-final.389681|accessdate=1 August 2013|newspaper=Times of Malta|date=October 18, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120529/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111018/rugby/N-Zealand-granted-French-leave-for-All-Black-final.389681|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[England national rugby union team|England]] used an all-black second kit at the [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011 World Cup]], which caused controversy in the host nation, as black is the home colour of [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Englandblackstuff"&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/5289989/England-go-all-black-for-Rugby-World-Cup "England go all black for Rugby World Cup"], [[Stuff.co.nz]], 15 July 2011. Retrieved 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; England wore the kit in one tournament match, against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]]. Critics in England in 2010 said the team was changing away kits unnecessarily and too often as a "marketing ploy".&lt;ref name="RFU defends"&gt;{{cite news|title=England v Australia: RFU defends use of grey away kit|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/8128426/England-v-Australia-RFU-defends-use-of-grey-away-kit.html|accessdate=3 June 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=12 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926054711/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/8128426/England-v-Australia-RFU-defends-use-of-grey-away-kit.html|archivedate=26 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], on the other hand, has rarely worn an away kit except against [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wallabies to be all white at the World Cup?|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/timeline/rugby/story/139290.html|accessdate=3 June 2014|work=ESPNscrum|date=5 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607002953/http://www.espnscrum.com/timeline/rugby/story/139290.html|archivedate=7 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a white jersey would have been worn in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Payten|first1=Iain|title=Wallabies all white for World Cup|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/wallabies-all-white-for-world-cup/story-e6frey4i-1226050161623|accessdate=3 June 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international rugby, the need for second kits arises most often in the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]], where Scotland, France and Italy all play in different shades of blue. The tournament takes the form of a single round-robin with home advantage alternating each year, and it is scheduled so that each of the three aforementioned sides plays one of the other two at home and the other away in a given season. In turn, this means that each of these three sides will play one home game in its alternate jersey. These have traditionally been white, but in the [[2015 Six Nations Championship|2015 Six Nations]] Scotland and France adopted red as their alternate colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Scotland alternate kit unveiled (24/09/14)|url=http://www.scottishrugby.org/news/14/09/24/new-scotland-alternate-kit-unveiled|website=ScottishRugby.org|publisher=Scottish Rugby|accessdate=23 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623051308/http://www.scottishrugby.org/news/14/09/24/new-scotland-alternate-kit-unveiled|archivedate=23 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France rugby team to wear red against Scotland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/31156290|accessdate=23 June 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=February 5, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311021359/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/31156290|archivedate=11 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International rules==
Ireland's green jersey is complemented by two away jerseys, one which is white in colour and one which is navy in colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oneills.com/shop-by-team/gaa/international-rules.html | title=International Rules - GAA - Shop By Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire [[Bible]] was published in Thai in 1894 and there are currently several translations of the Bible in the [[Thai language]].

==Contemporary Translations==
Thai translations of the Bible currently in print include the Thai Standard Version (THSV 2011), the Thai New Contemporary Version (NTCV), the Thai King James Version (TKJV), the New Thai Translation Version (New Testament only), and the Easy-to-Read Thai Bible (ERV). A Thai translation of the [[Apocrypha]] is also available from [[Catholic Church in Thailand|Thai Catholic]] booksellers.

==History of Thai Bible Translation==
The earliest known attempt at a translation of the Bible into Thai is a free translation of the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke, starting at verse 5.  This was translated in 1685 by Louis Laneau of the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]].&lt;ref&gt;E. W.Hutchinson, "The Earliest Translation of the Gospel." Journal of the Siam Society 28 (1935): 197-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first Protestant effort at Thai Bible translation was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew by [[Ann Hasseltine Judson|Ann Judson]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex G. Smith, "Siamese Gold, A History of Church Growth in Thailand: An Interpretive Analysis 1816-1982" (Kanok Bannasan (OMF Publishers): Bangkok, 1981), 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Gützlaff]] and [[Jacob Tomlin]], who are regarded as the first two resident Protestant missionaries in Thailand, translated the four Gospels and Romans from Chinese into Thai.  They were assisted by a Chinese man and a Burmese man, both of whom spoke Thai.&lt;ref&gt;Alex G. Smith, "Siamese Gold, A History of Church Growth in Thailand: An Interpretive Analysis 1816-1982" (Kanok Bannasan (OMF Publishers): Bangkok, 1981), 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Taylor Jones]], an [[American Baptist Missionary Union|ABMU]] missionary, translated the New Testament from Greek into the [[Thai language]]. Part of the Bible in Thai was first published in 1834. Jones' translation of the [[New Testament]] in Thai was printed for the first time in 1846. &lt;ref&gt;Baptist Missionary Magazine, vol. 26 (Boston: Baptist General Convention, 1846), 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The translation of the Old Testament was finished in 1883 and the Bible with the complete Protestant canon in Thai was published as a single volume for the first time in 1894.  This edition of the Bible was later revised by the [[Thailand Bible Society]] using the King James Version (KJV) as the base text and published as the Thai Standard Version in 1940.  This translation was subsequently revised using the Revised Standard Version (RSV) and Authorized Standard Version (ASV) as the base text and republished in 1971.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaibible.or.th/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=105&amp;Itemid=43 |title=What is the History of the Thai Bible?

==Other Language Bibles in Thailand==
In addition to the Thai Bible, several other language Bible translations are used in [[Thailand]], especially among ethnic minorities.  These include [[Bible translations into Chinese|Chinese]], [[Bible translations into Lao|Lao]], [[Bible translations into Burmese|Burmese]], [[Bible translations into Cambodian|Cambodian]], [[Bible translations into the languages of Indonesia and Malaysia|Malay]], [[Bible translations into Karen|Karen]], [[Bible translations into Akha|Akha]], [[Bible translations into Hmong|Hmong]], [[Bible_translations_into_the_languages_of_China#Lahu|Lahu]], [[Bible translations into Lawa|Lawa]], and [[Bible translations into Shan|Shan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4945">{{about|the term|the film|Carnal Knowledge}}
'''Carnal knowledge''' is an [[Archaism|archaic]] or legal [[euphemism]] for [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of "carnal knowledge" |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=carnal+knowledge |work=[[WordNet]] |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |accessdate=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern statutes, the term "[[sexual penetration]]" is widely used, though with various definitions.

==Biblical source==
The term derives from the [[Bible|Biblical]] usage of the verb ''know/knew'', as in the [[King James Version|King James Bible]] and other versions, a euphemism for sexual conduct.

Examples of this usage include the first part of the Bible, the [[Book of Genesis]], which describes how [[Adam and Eve]] conceived their first child:

:"''And Adam '''knew''' Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], and said, I have gotten a man with [the help of] [[Jehovah]].''" — [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Genesis#4|Genesis 4:1]].

And in [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]’s plea to the people of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] to whom he offered his virgin daughters, in place of his guests:
:5 and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may '''know''' them.
:6 And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him.
:7 And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly.
:8 Behold now, I have two daughters that have not '''known''' man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing, forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof. — [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Genesis#4|Genesis 19:5-8]].

==Legal usage==
In [[criminal law]], the term has had different meanings at different times and in different [[jurisdiction]]s. While commonly a mere euphemism for sexual intercourse (not necessarily unlawful), different jurisdictions have defined carnal knowledge (as well as sexual intercourse) as a specific sex act such as contact between a [[human penis|penis]] and [[vagina]], some laws elaborating this to include even "slight penile penetration of female [[sex organ]]s". The definition sometimes includes a set of sex acts that include [[sodomy]], while some statutes specifically exclude such acts. Some laws do not define the term, and leave it to the courts to give it meaning, which also allows them to take into account changing community standards.

Carnal knowledge has also sometimes meant [[sexual intercourse outside of marriage]], and sometimes refers to sex with someone under the [[age of consent]]. The phrase is often found in this sense in modern legal usage, being equivalent to [[statutory rape]] in some jurisdictions, as the term ''[[rape]]'' implies lack of consent.

A related term is '''carnal abuse''', which is defined by [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]] as "any lascivious contact with the sexual organs of a child by an adult". Usually, but not always, this does not involve penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of "carnal abuse" |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/carnal+abuse |work=[[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
Section 18 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]] reads as follows:

{{cquote|What shall be sufficient Proof of carnal Knowledge in the Four preceding Cases.

XVIII. 'And Whereas upon Trials for the Crimes of [[Buggery]] and of [[Rape in English law#History|Rape]], and of carnally abusing Girls under the respective Ages hereinbefore mentioned, Offenders frequently escape by reason of the Difficulty of the Proof which has been required of the Completion of those several Crimes;' for Remedy thereof be it enacted, That it shall not be necessary, in any of those Cases, to prove the actual Emission of Seed to constitute carnal Knowledge, but that the carnal Knowledge shall be deemed complete upon Proof of Penetration only.}}

The crimes of carnally abusing girls referred to were those created by section 17 of the Act.

In cases decided under this section it was held that the slightest penetration was sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;''R v R'Rue'' (1838) 8 C &amp; P 641; ''R v Allen'' (1839) 9 C &amp; P 31&lt;/ref&gt;

This section was replaced by section 63 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]. The term was not used in the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]], which replaced it, where it appeared, with the term ''[[Sexual intercourse in English law|sexual intercourse]]'', in all the provisions consolidated by that Act.

'''Coil waste''' is a type of U.S. stamp made from damaged or unusable printing stock intended for use as [[coil stamp]]s and is a term applied to several stamp issues of the late 1910s and early 20s.  Sometimes in the printing of [[coil stamp|coils]] on [[Rotary printing press|rotary presses]], a number stamps from the run were deemed unusable for coil production.  Instead of discarding these, the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] processed them through the flat-plate perforating machine to finish them as fully perforated stamps.  These finished products are known as coil waste.  While seemingly identical to normal fully perforated issues (which were printed on flat plate presses), coil waste stamps are distinguishable by their size: their designs are slightly wider or longer than normal because rotary press printing slightly stretches an image.

The stamps removed from coil production in the late teens and early twenties were "discarded as unfit," according to a report from a director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing "on account of narrow margins, too close perforations and other reasons." &lt;ref name="Johl"&gt;{{cite book |title='''The United States Postage Stamps of the Twentieth Century, Volume I''' |year=1937 |publisher=H. L. Lindquist |first=Beverly |last=King |author2=Johl, Max}}, a: p. 118; b: pp. 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable example is a 1919 1¢ Washington stamp ([[Scott Catalogue]] #538).  This, according to [[Max G. Johl|Max Johl]], had "received the regulation one way [vertical] coil perforation while forming part of the long rolls of stamps printed on the rotary press. The coil perforating machines…fitted for perforating rolls of stamps could not be used to perforate sheets, so these [stamps] had to be perforated the other way (horizontally) on the regulation eleven gauge flat plate perforating machines."&lt;ref name="Johl"/&gt;  The rarest coil waste issue from the [[Washington-Franklin Issues|Washington-Franklin]] series is another 1¢ Washington stamp produced in 1921 (Scott #544).  Other Washington-Franklin examples include Scott #539-541.

[[File:Franklin coil stamps 2c 1923 issue.jpg|thumb|226px|Stamps in a 'coil' configuration]]
In 1923, during the production of the U. S. [[US Regular Issues of 1922-1931|Fourth Bureau definitive series]], four coil waste issues were made from short ends left over after the long printed rotary rolls had been cut into proper coil lengths (such as 500 or 1000 stamps).  The excess production occurred in the coil versions of the 1¢ Franklin and 2¢ Washington stamps (Scott #597 and 599).  One batch of each issue had been perforated 10 vertically, and those stamps were then perforated 11 horizontally to produce Scott #578 and [[:File:Regular issue coil waste 1923 issue 2c.JPG|579]];  the remaining, smaller group of short ends had not been perforated, and these were finished with gauge 11 perforations on all sides (Scott #594 and 595). Rarest of the four is #594: a 1¢ Franklin stamp.

Several extremely rare stamps from this period sometimes misidentified as coil waste were actually produced from the waste printing of sheet stamps.  These include another 1¢ Franklin issue (Scott #596) and the perforated 11 rotary press Harding Memorial stamp (Scott #613).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siegelauctions.com/enc/pdf/1923Rotary.pdf|title=Siegel Encyclopedia Stamps |work=siegelauctions.com |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crasis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|eɪ|s|ɪ|s}};&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|crasis}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Greek {{lang|grc|κρᾶσις}}, "mixing", "blending")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kra{{=}}sis|κρᾶσις|ref}}; cf. {{LSJ|kera/nnumi|κεράννῡμι}}, "I mix" ''wine with water''; ''[[Krater|kratēr]]'' "mixing-bowl" is related.&lt;/ref&gt;  is a type of [[synalepha|contraction]] in which two vowels or diphthongs [[coalescence (linguistics)|merge]] into one new vowel or [[diphthong]], making one word out of two. Crasis occurs in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as well as in [[Ancient Greek]], for which it was first described.

In some cases, like in the [[French language|French]] examples below, crasis involves the grammaticalization of two individual lexical items into one, but in other cases, like in the Greek examples, crasis is the orthographic representation of the [[enclitic]]ization and vowel reduction of one grammatical form with another. The difference between the two is that the Greek examples involve two [[grammatical words]] and a single [[phonological word]] and the French examples involve a single [[phonological word]] and [[grammatical word]].

==Greek==
In both Ancient and [[Modern Greek]], crasis merges a small word and long word closely connected in meaning.{{refn|group=n|Note on terminology:&lt;br /&gt;''Crasis'', in English, usually refers to merging of words, but the sense of the word in the original Greek used to be more general&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; and refer to most changes related to vowel contraction, including [[synaeresis]].}}

In Ancient Greek, a [[coronis (diacritic)|coronis]] ({{lang|grc|κορωνίς}} ''korōnís'' "curved"; plural {{lang|grc|κορωνίδες}} ''korōnídes'') marks the vowel from crasis. In ancient times, it was an apostrophe placed after the vowel ({{lang|grc|τα᾽μά}}), but it is now written over the vowel {{lang|grc|τἀμά}}, and it is identical to [[smooth breathing]] in [[Unicode]]. (For instance, {{lang|grc|τἀμά}} uses the character {{unichar|1F00|Greek small letter alpha with psili}}; ''psili'' means smooth breathing.) Unlike a coronis, smooth breathing never occurs on a vowel in the middle of a word (although it occurs on [[gemination|doubled]] [[rho (letter)|rho]]: {{lang|grc|πύῤῥος}} ''pyrrhos'').

The [[Ancient Greek definite article|article]] undergoes crasis with nouns and adjectives that start with a vowel:
* {{lang|grc|τὰ ἐμά → τᾱ̓μά}} "my (affairs)"
* {{lang|grc|τὸ ἐναντίον → τοὐναντίον}} "on the contrary"
* {{lang|grc|τὸ αὐτό → ταὐτό}} "the same"
* {{lang|grc|τὰ αὐτά → ταὐτά}} (plural of the previous example)

καί undergoes crasis with the first-person singular pronoun and produces a long vowel:
* {{lang|grc|καὶ ἐγώ → κᾱ̓γώ}} "and I", "I too"
* {{lang|grc|καὶ ἐμοί → κᾱ̓μοί}} "and to me"

In modern monotonic orthography, the coronis is not written.

==French==
In French, the contractions of determiners are often the results of a vocalisation and a crasis:
* ''de le'' → ''du'', ''de les'' → ''des''
* ''à le'' → ''au'', ''à les'' → ''aux''
* ''en les'' → ''ès'' (archaic)

==Portuguese==
{{Expand section|date=August 2007}}

The most frequently observed crasis today is the contraction of the preposition ''a'' ("to" or "at") with the feminine singular definite article ''a'' ("the"), indicated in writing with a [[grave accent]], or the masculine singular definite article ''o'' (also "the"). For example, instead of ''*Vou a a praia'' ("I go '''to the''' beach"), one says ''Vou à praia'' ("I go '''to-the''' beach"). The contraction turns the [[clitic]] ''a'' into the stressed word ''à''. Meanwhile, a person going to a bank, a supermarket or a marketplace would say ''Vou ao banco'', ''Vou ao supermercado'' or ''Vou à feira'', respectively.

Crasis also occurs between the preposition ''a'' and [[demonstrative]]s: for instance, when the preposition precedes ''aquele(s)'', ''aquela(s)'' (meaning "that", "those", in different genders), they contract to ''àquele(s)'', ''àquela(s)''. The accent marks a [[secondary stress]] in Portuguese.

In addition, the crasis ''à'' is pronounced [[Vowel#Height|lower]] as {{IPAslink|a}} than the article or preposition ''a'', as {{IPAslink|ɐ}}, in the examples in standard [[European Portuguese]], but the qualitative distinction is not made by most speakers in [[Brazilian Portuguese]] (some dialects, as [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s ''fluminense'', are exceptions and make the distinction).

Crasis is very important, as it can change the meaning of a sentence:

* ''Exposta, '''a''' polícia'' - The police is exposed
* ''Exposta '''à''' polícia'' - She is exposed to the police
* ''Glória, '''a''' rainha'' - Glória the queen
* ''Glória '''à''' rainha'' - Glory to the queen
* ''Dê '''a''' mulher'' - Give the woman
* ''Dê '''à''' mulher'' - Give to the woman

These rules determine whether the crasis always apply, or whether one ''may'' use the contraction ''à'' (with an accent) instead of the preposition ''a'' (without an accent):

Replace the preposition ''a'' by another preposition, as ''em'' ("in") or ''para'' ("to"). If, with replacement, the definite article ''a'' ("the") is still possible, crasis applies:

* ''Pedro viajou à Região Nordeste'': with a grave accent because it equivalent to "Pedro traveled 'to the' [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]]". Here, ''para a Região Nordeste'' could also be used.
* ''O autor dedicou o livro a sua esposa'': without a grave accent in Brazilian Portuguese because it is equivalent to "The author dedicated the book 'to' his wife". A consistent use, according to the rules in [[Brazil]] would '''not''' allow ''para a sua esposa'' be used instead. In [[European Portuguese]], nevertheless, rules are different, and it is ''O autor dedicou o livro à sua esposa'', but in English, both sentences have the same meaning.

If the nominal complement is changed, after "a", from a feminine noun to a masculine noun and it is now necessary to use 'ao' (used naturally by native speakers), crasis applies:

* ''Prestou relevantes serviços à comunidade'', ''He/she paid outstanding services to the community'': with a grave accent because if one changes the object to a masculine noun ("Prestou relevantes serviços ao povo" ''He/she paid outstanding services to the people''), one now uses "ao" ("to [masculine] the").
* "Chegarei daqui a uma hora" ''I will arrive in an hour'': without crasis because when the femi one noun is changed to a masculine noun ("Chegarei daqui a um minuto" ''I will arrive in a minute''), there is no "ao" (as "um/uma", indefinite articles, appear instead of "o/a").

The grave accent is never used before masculine words (nouns, pronouns, etc.); verbs; personal pronouns; numerals, plural nouns without the use of the feminine plural definite article ''as'' ("the"); city names that do not use a feminine article; the word ''casa'' ("house") if it has the meaning of one's own home;/the word ''terra'' ("earth") when it has the meaning of soil; and indefinite, personal, relative or demonstrative pronouns (except the third person and ''aquele(s)'' or ''aquela(s)''); between identical nouns§ such as ''dia a dia'' "day by day", "everyday", "daily life", ''gota a gota'' "dropwise", "drip", and ''cara a cara'' "face to face"; and after prepositions. Here are exceptions:

''É preciso declarar guerra à guerra!'' (It is necessary to declare war on war!)

''É preciso dar mais vida à vida.'' (It is necessary to give more life to life.)

===Optional crasis===

The grave accent is optional in the following cases:

* Before a female's first name

''Refiro-me [à/a] Fernanda.'' (I am referring to Fernanda.)

* Before a feminine possessive pronoun

''Dirija-se [à/a] sua fazenda.'' (Go to your [own] [[hacienda]].)

* After the preposition ''até'

''Dirija-se até [à/a] porta.'' (Go by that door.)

''Eu fui até [à/a] França de carro.'' (I traveled to [[France]] by car.)

'''Dama''' is an extinct language of [[Sierra Leone]].  It was replaced by [[Mende language|Mende]].  Based on a few remembered words and toponyms, Dalby (1963) believed it to be a Northern [[Mande language]], similar to Kono and Vai, but ''Glottolog'' leaves it unclassified.

'''Dnipropetrovsk Oblast''' ({{lang-uk|Дніпропетро́вська о́бласть}}, ''Dnipropetrovs'ka oblast'' or Дніпропетровщина, ''Dnipropetrovshchyna'', {{lang-ru|link=no|Днепропетро́вская о́бласть}} {{IPA-ru|dʲnʲɪprəpʲɪˈtrofskəjə ˈobɫəsʲtʲ|}}) is an [[administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblast]] (province) of central [[Ukraine]], the most important industrial region of the country.  It was created on February 27, 1932. Dnipropetrovsk has a population of about {{Ua-pop-est2017|3,230,411}}, approximately 80% of whom live centering on [[administrative center]] of [[Dnipro]], [[Kryvyi Rih]], [[Kamianske]], [[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]].

==Geography==
The Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is located in southeastern Ukraine. The area of the oblast (31,974&amp;nbsp;km²), comprises about 5.3% of the total area of the country. Its longitude from north to south is 130&amp;nbsp;km, from east to west – 300&amp;nbsp;km. The oblast borders the [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava]] and [[Kharkiv Oblast]]s on the north, the [[Donetsk Oblast]] on the east, the [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast|Zaporizhzhia]] and [[Kherson Oblast]]s on the south, and the [[Mykolayiv Oblast|Mykolayiv]] and [[Kirovohrad Oblast]]s on the west.

[[Black Sea Lowland]] almost completely within the south oblast, covering half of its territory. In [[Ternivka]] located [[Ternovka crater|meteorite crater]]. It is 11&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and the age is estimated to be 280 ± 10 million years ([[Permian]]). The crater is not exposed at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Earth Impact DB | name = Ternovka| accessdate = 2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dnieper Upland]] contains a number of minerals including [[Iron ore|iron]], [[manganese]], [[granite]], [[graphite]], [[brown coal]], [[kaolin]] etc. [[Kryvbas]] is an important economic region, specializing in iron ore mining and the steel industry. It is arguably the main iron ore region of Eastern Europe. Named after the city of Kryvyi Rih, the region occupies the southwestern part of the Dnipropetrovsk, as well as a small neighboring part of the [[Kirovohrad Oblast]].

The region possesses major deposits of iron ore and some other metallurgical ores. To exploit them, several large mining companies were founded here in the middle of the 20th century. Most of them are located in Kryvyi Rih itself, which is the longest city in Europe.

==History==
[[File:Delineatio generalis Camporum Desertorum vulgo Ukraina (1648).jpg|thumb|1648 map of [[Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan|Beauplan]] where [[Wild Fields|Dzikie Pole]] identified in upper portion of the map.]]
At the beginning of the 15th century, [[Tatar]] tribes inhabiting the right bank of the Dnieper were driven away by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].  However, by the mid-15th century, the [[Nogais|Nogai]] (who lived north of the [[Sea of Azov]]) and the [[Crimean Khanate]] invaded these lands. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crimean Khanate agreed to a border along the Dnieper, and farther east along the [[Samara River]], i.e. through what is today the city of Dnipro. It was in this time that there appeared a new force–the [[Cossacks]], armed freemen not subject to any feudal lord– who were to soon dominate the region . They later became known as [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], from [[Zaporizhia]]–the lands south of Prydniprovye– which translates as "the Land Beyond the Weirs [Rapids]").  This was a period of raids and fighting causing considerable devastation and [[depopulation]] in that area; the area became known as [[Wild Fields|the 'Wilderness']].

In 1635, the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish Government]] built the [[Kodak Fortress|Kodak fortress]] above the [[Dnieper Rapids]] at ''Kodaky'', partly as a result of rivalry in the region between Poland, [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]],&lt;ref name=Go2Kiev&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.go2kiev.com/view/dnepropetrovsk.html|title=Go2Kiev Dnepropetrovsk|publisher=Go2kiev.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly to maintain control over Cossack activity (i.e. to suppress the Cossack raiders and to prevent peasants moving out of the area).&lt;ref name=SerhiiPlokhy&gt;Plokhy, Serhii, ''The Cossacks and Religion in Early Modern Ukraine'', pub Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-924739-0}}, pages 26, 37, 40, 51, 60–1, 142, 245, and 268.&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 3 or 4 August 1635, the Cossacks of [[Ivan Sulyma]] captured the fort by surprise, burning it down and butchering the garrison of about 200 West European mercenaries under Jean Marion.&lt;ref name=SerhiiPlokhy/&gt; The fort was rebuilt by French engineer [[Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan]]&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume le Vasseur de Beauplan wrote a book ''Description d'Ukrainie'', published in 1651 and 1660.&lt;/ref&gt; for the Polish Government in 1638, and had a mercenary garrison.&lt;ref name=SerhiiPlokhy/&gt;  ''Kodak'' was captured by [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporozhian Cossacks]] on 1 October 1648, and was garrisoned by the Cossacks until its demolition in accordance with the [[Treaty of the Pruth]] in 1711.&lt;ref name=Kodak_Pruth&gt;[http://www.day.kiev.ua/296952/ www.day.kiev.ua ''Above Kodak, this year the unique fortress marks its 375th anniversary''], by Mykola Chaban, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] of 1654, the territory became part of the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Empire]]. In 1774 [[Grigori Aleksandrovich Potemkin|Prince Grigori Potemkin]] was appointed governor of [[Novorossiysk Governorate]], and after the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich, he started founding cities in the region and encouraging foreign settlers. The city of ''Yekaterinoslav'' was founded in 1776, not in the current location, but at the confluence of the [[Samara River (Dnieper)|River Samara]] with the River Kil'chen' at [[Loshakivka]], north of the Dnieper. On May 8, 1775, after the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russian-Turkish War]], Russian authorities opened a [[Kryvyi Rih|postal station and track]] which linked Kremenchuk, Kinburn foreland and Ochakov, all locations of the Imperial Russian Army.

In December 1796, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] reestablished the Novorossiysk Governorate, mostly with land from the former [[Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty]]. In 1802, this province was divided into the [[Nikolayev Governorate]] (known as the Kherson Governorate from 1803), [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]], and the [[Taurida Governorate]]. Its capital was the city of [[Yekaterinoslav]] (modern Dnipro) created in 1802 out the Yekaterinoslav Vice-regency. It was located within the former lands of [[Zaporizhian Sich]]. The government bordered to the north with the [[Kharkov Governorate]] and [[Poltava Governorate]], to the west and southwest with the [[Kherson Governorate]], to the south with the [[Taurida Governorate]] and [[Sea of Azov]], and to the east with [[Don Host Oblast]].

[[Olexander Paul]] discovered and initiated iron ore investigation and production,&lt;ref&gt;Sudrussland Mageteisen und Sisenglantztatten&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Рубін П.Криворожский бассейн и его железные руды. Горный журнал, 1888 г., т. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and this in turn caused the formation of a mining district.&lt;ref&gt;Конткевич С. Геологічний опис околиць Кривого Рогу, Херсонської губернії&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] initiated the founding project of a railway,&lt;ref&gt;Записки капитан-лейтенанта Семечкина», Вид. Об-ва горных инженеров, 1900 р&lt;/ref&gt; running {{convert|505|km}}. This enabled transportation directly to the nearest factories and greatly sped up the development of the region.

On 1 August 1925, the Yekaterinoslav Governorate administration was discontinued, and in 1926 the city of Yekterinoslav was renamed Dnipropetrovsk in honor of communist leader [[Grigory Petrovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2015/05/15/7068057/ Poroshenko signed the laws about decomunization].

In 1932 the territory of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] was re-established based on oblasts. The first oblasts were [[Vinnytsia Oblast]], [[Kiev Oblast]], [[Odessa Oblast]], [[Kharkiv Oblast]], and Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Soon after that in the summer of 1932 [[Donetsk Oblast]] was formed out of eastern parts of Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk.

During the [[Ukrainian independence referendum, 1991|1991 referendum]], 90.36% of votes in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast were in favor of the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]]. A survey conducted in December 2014 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 2.2% of the oblast's population supported their region joining Russia, 89.9% did not support the idea, and the rest were undecided or did not respond.&lt;ref name=DT150103&gt;{{cite news |url= http://dt.ua/UKRAINE/lishe-3-ukrayinciv-hochut-priyednannya-yih-oblasti-do-rosiyi-160641_.html |script-title=uk:Лише 3% українців хочуть приєднання їх області до Росії |language= Ukrainian |trans-title= Only 3% of Ukrainians want their region to become part of Russia |work= [[Dzerkalo Tyzhnia]] |date= 3 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 8 over-Dnieper bridges and dozens of grade-separated intersections. Several new intersections are under construction. [[European route E105]] cross Left-bank Dnipro from North to South. [[Highway M04 (Ukraine)]] and [[Highway M18 (Ukraine)]] cross River Dnieper and [[Dnipro]] from West to East, entering Kryvyi Rih. Overall, roads are in poor technical condition and maintained inadequately.

[[Near-Dnipro Railway]] (NDZ), headquartered in Dnipro, is a component part of the [[Ukrzaliznytsia]] (UZ) company. NDR's route map includes all the railroads in the Dnipropetrovsk, [[Zaporizhya]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Kherson]] and [[Crimea]] oblasts (provinces of Ukraine).
As of 2008, NDR's rail system included 3,275&amp;nbsp;km (2,035&amp;nbsp;mi) of track, of which 93,3% were electrified. The PDR consists of five sections (directions), the Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhya, Kryvyi Rih, and Crimea directions. There are 244 railway stations in the NDR system. More than a dozens of ''elektrichka'' stops are located within the city allowing residents of different neighborhoods to use the suburban trains.

The cities of Dnipro and Kryvyi Rih are served by a local sales-tax-funded bus, tram, metro and trolleybus systems.

[[Dnipropetrovsk International Airport]]  is the only international airport in the state and serves as one of the hubs for [[Dniproavia]]. The airport has non-stop service to over 20 destinations throughout Ukraine, Russia, and Turkey, as well as to Vienna and Tel Aviv.

==Economy==
The Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has a high industry potential. There are 712 basic industrial organizations, including 20 different types of economic activity with about 473,4 thousand workers. The area also produces about 16.9% of the total industry production of Ukraine. This places the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast second in Ukraine (after the neighbouring [[Donetsk Oblast]]).

Dnipro is a major industrial centre of Ukraine. It has several facilities devoted to heavy industry that produce a wide range of products, including [[cast-iron]], rolled metal, pipes, [[machinery]], different mining combines, [[agricultural equipment]], [[tractor]]s, [[trolleybus]]es, refrigerators, different chemicals and many others. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The most famous and the oldest (founded in the 19th century) is the Metallurgical Plant named after Petrovsky. The city also has big food processing and light industry factories. Many sewing and dress-making factories work for [[France]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]] and [[Great Britain]] {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, using the most advanced technologies, materials and design. Dnipro has also dominated in the [[aerospace industry]] since the 1950s; construction department [[Yuzhnoye Design Bureau]] and [[Yuzhmash]] are well known to the specialists{{which|date=July 2014}} all over the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[Yuzhmash]] is a manufacturer of space [[rocket]]s, [[agricultural equipment]], [[bus]]es, [[trolley bus]]es, [[tram]]s, [[wind turbine]]s, and [[satellite]]s that was inherited from the [[Soviet Union]]. It is a large state-owned{{by whom|date=July 2014}}&lt;!-- this article covers 1950s onward.  at one time, perhaps, the USSR.  But what about today?

The region possesses major deposits of iron ore and some other metallurgical ores. To exploit them, several large mining companies were founded here in the middle of the 20th century. Most of them are located in Kryvyi Rih itself, which is the longest city in Europe. Steel companies of the region (except Mittal Steel-owned Kryvorizhstal) are controlled by either the [[Privat Group]] or the [[SCM Holdings|SCM]]. From the 1990s until 2004, these once united and state-owned industries went through a hard and scandal-ridden process of privatization. Being a business oligarch entity, Privat Group controls some prominent Ukrainian media, maintains close relations with politicians and sponsors professional sports. Key businesses of the group (including the [[Privatbank]] itself) are based in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which is regarded as its "homeland". Group's founding owners are natives of Dnipropetrovsk and made their entire career there.

==Culture==
Historically, [[Dnieper Ukraine]] comprised territory that roughly corresponded to the area of Ukraine within the expanding [[Russian Empire]]. Ukrainians sometimes call it Great Ukraine (Velyka Ukrayina). Historically, this region is tightly entwined with the history of Ukraine and is considered as the heart of the country.

[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (Middle Dnieprian dialect, 67,0%) and [[Russian language|Russian]] (31,9%) language are both equally used officially, with Russian being more common in cities, while Ukrainian is the dominant language in rural communities. These details result in a significant difference across different survey results, as even a small restating of a question switches responses of a significant group of people. The speaking of [[Surzhyk]] instead of Russian or Ukrainian is wide and viewed negatively by nationalist language activists. Because it is neither the one nor the other, they regard Surzhyk as a threat to the uniqueness of Ukrainian culture.

It was constructed by [[Stanisław Koniecpolski]] to control [[Cossack]]s of [[Zaporizhian Sich]], prevent [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[peasants]] from joining forces with the Cossacks and guard the southeastern corner of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The Poles tried to establish order in that area, and commissioned [[France|French]] military cartographer and engineer [[William le Vasseur de Beauplan]] to construct it. The fortress cost around 100,000 Polish zlotys. The [[dragoon]] garrison was commanded by the French officer [[Jean de Marion]]. Soviet government attempted to destroy remnants of fortress in order to eradicate traces of Polish influences on Ukraine by setting quarry on that site in 1944. Quarry was closed in 1994, but to that moment two third of fortress was completely destroyed. Today the site is just ruins, but it is a popular tourist attraction.

Prince [[Grigory Potemkin]] envisioned the church as one of the spiritual centres of [[New Russia]]. [[Ivan Starov]] submitted to Potemkin his designs for a Roman-style basilica, but construction was postponed until the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War]].

{{Main|Cossack with musket}}

A Cossack with a musket was an emblem of the [[Zaporizhian Host]] and later the state emblem of the Hetmanate and the [[Ukrainian State]]. The origin of the emblem is uncertain, while its first records date back to 1592. On the initiative of [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] the emblem was phased out and replaced by the Russian double-headed eagle in 1767.

A Cossack with a rifle was restored by the [[Hetman of Ukraine]] [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] in 1918.  However, later the emblem disappeared again until in 2005 it reappeared on the proposed Great Seal of Ukraine. In 2002 was adopted flag and identical coat of arms of Oblast, which consists of cossack with musket and nine yellow eight-pointed stars. Stars represent coat of arms of [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]] which also consisted of imperial monogram of [[Catherine the Great]].

To be '''''economical with the truth''''' literally means to avoid revealing too much of the truth. While the idea may have an approbatory sense of [[prudence]] or diplomacy, the phrase is often either used [[euphemism|euphemistically]] to denote dissimulation ([[misleading]] by withholding pertinent information) or else used [[irony|ironically]] to mean outright [[Lie|lying]].

The [[Economy (religion)|religious sense of "economy"]] was applied to [[religious truth]] by [[John Henry Newman]], based on Jesus' injunction not to cast [[Matthew 7:6|pearls before swine]].&lt;ref name="Shell1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shell|first=Marc|title=The Economy of Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFefxqBFC54C&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=16 April 2015|date=1 September 1993|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801846946|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman advocated "cautious dispensation of the truth, after the manner of a discreet and vigilant steward" while being "careful ever to maintain ''substantial'' truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmanreader.org/works/apologia65/notef.html|title=Apologia pro Vita Sua (1865) – Note F.

The Economy|last=Newman|first=John Henry|year=1865|work=Newman Reader|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mental reservation]] is a somewhat related idea also associated with Roman Catholic ethics.

A jocular reference to the basic concept was made by [[Mark Twain]] in ''[[Following the Equator]]'' in 1897:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/wilson/pwequat.html|title=Following the Equator: Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar|last=Twain|first=Mark|year=1897|work=Mark Twain in His Times|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leavenworth|first=Charles S.|title=The Arrow War with China |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023144060#page/n227/mode/1up |year=1901|publisher=Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Co. |location=London|page=208|chapter=The Dawn of Peace|quote=Mark Twain once said, " Truth is the most valuable thing we have. Let us economize it ! " But there is no necessity to be economical with the truth about the motives of the Cabinets of the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Truth is the most valuable thing we have. Let us economise it.}}

The precise phrase "economical with the truth" is attested from 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=14 January 1897|title=.|journal=Iron Age|publisher=[[Chilton Company]]|volume=57|page=28|quote=If you can't say its dead dull with them, one can say without being economical with the truth that they are in a condition of "masterly inactivity." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=12 June 1897|title=.|journal=The Weekly Underwriter|volume=56|issue=24|page=413|quote=The insurance superintendent of Kansas is said to be very economical with the truth.

==Political catchphrase==
"Economical with the truth" became a political [[catchphrase]] in the United Kingdom in 1986 during the ''[[Spycatcher]]'' trial in the Australian [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]], when [[Robert Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Ilminster|Robert Armstrong]], the [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|UK Cabinet Secretary]], was questioned by [[Malcolm Turnbull]], and described a letter thus:&lt;ref name="odq56" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durant 1996, pp.4–5&lt;/ref&gt;
*Q: So that letter contains a lie, does it not?
*A: It contains a misleading impression in that respect.
*Q: Which you knew to be misleading at the time you made it?
*A: Of course.
*Q: So it contains a lie?
*A: It is a misleading impression, it does not contain a lie, I don't think.
*Q: What is the difference between a misleading impression and a lie?
*A: You are as good at English as I am.
*Q: I am just trying to understand.
*A: A lie is a straight untruth.
*Q: What is a misleading impression – a sort of bent untruth?
*A: As one person said, it is perhaps being economical with the truth.

[[Bob Ellis]] wrote that the audience had laughed at "bent untruth", and that Armstrong expected a laugh for "economical with the truth" but got none.&lt;ref name="Ellis2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Bob|title=And So it Went|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9JIRzPVl2wC&amp;pg=PT150|accessdate=16 April 2015|date=4 May 2009|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780857966025|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political opponents of the government's actions in the ''Spycatcher'' case derided Armstrong's distinction.

In 1992, when [[Alan Clark]] was questioned at the [[Old Bailey]] by [[Geoffrey Robertson]] in an [[Arms-to-Iraq]] case, he accounted for the discrepancies between his testimony and statements he had made previously. His response became notorious:&lt;ref name="Trewin2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trewin|first=Ion|authorlink = Ion Trewin |title=Alan Clark: The Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFVvSAaTANMC&amp;pg=PT158|accessdate=16 April 2015|date=14 September 2009|publisher=Orion|isbn=9780297857822|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="odq212"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rjLTsncFKCgC&amp;pg=PT212 ''Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations'' 2007, p.212]&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Clark: it's our old friend "economical"
* Robertson: with the truth?
* Clark: With the ''actualité''. There was nothing misleading or dishonest to make a formal or introductory comment that the Iraqis would be using the current orders for general engineering purposes. All I didn't say was 'and for making munitions'.

Alan Durant was an [[expert witness]] in a 1992 [[libel]] suit brought by a man who had been described as "economical with the truth". The [[defendant]] claimed the words did not imply the [[plaintiff]] was a liar. Durant, after examining a [[Corpus linguistics|corpus]] of uses of the phrase, felt that lying had become the default meaning, but might be over-ridden based on the [[Context (language use)|context]]. The earlier allusion to Burke or Twain was no longer common. The libel suit was [[settled out of court]].&lt;ref&gt;Durant 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Intellectual===

Elisabeth Leinfellner studied linguistics at the [[University of Vienna]] and [[University of Munich]] and worked as a freelance "copy editor."  She moved to [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]] and taught at [[Doane College]] in [[Crete, Nebraska|Crete]], Nebraska and at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]]. in 1975, she cofounded the [[International Wittgenstein Symposium]] of the [[Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society]] (ALWS).&lt;ref name="Windholz"/&gt;&lt;ref name = EL&gt;{{cite web|title=Institut für Sprachwissenschaft ao.Univ.Prof. Elisabeth Leinfellner|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/linguistics/personal/leinfellner/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, she returned to Austria and 1990 she obtained [[habilitation]] qualification at the Institute of Linguistics of the University of Vienna with a thesis on semantic networks and context. From 1994-1997 she served as president of ALWS and was vice president from 1997 to 2010. She was on the editorial committee of the new publication series of the ALWS and the reports of the ALWS.&lt;ref name="Windholz"/&gt;&lt;ref name = EL/&gt;

She had visiting professorships at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1992, at the [[University of Michigan]] (1997 Max Kade Distinguished Visiting Professor) in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], and the [[University of Rome Tor Vergata|University of Rome II]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Windholz"/&gt;&lt;ref name = EL/&gt;&lt;ref name =alws&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary of Univ.-Prof. Dr. Elisabeth Leinfellner 1938 – 2010|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/alws/kondolenzbuch_elisabeth_leinfellner/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1996, she organized for the [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]] - Honors College with the University of Vienna and sponsored students.&lt;ref name =alws/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erica Shafran, Fulbright to Austria for Linquistics|url=http://www.iup.edu/honors/page.aspx?id=115048}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, she became a member of  program committee for the Summer School at the [[Institute Vienna Circle]] of the University of Vienna.&lt;ref name="Windholz"/&gt;&lt;ref name = EL/&gt;

===Personal===

In 1960, she married [[Werner Leinfellner]] and they had one daughter Ruth. She died in a Vienna hospital on January 4, 2010 and her husband Werner followed her in death three months later on April 6, 2010.&lt;ref name="Windholz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stadler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stadler|first=Friedrich|title=Werner Leinfellner (1921-2010|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ivc/WLeinfellnerE.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="german"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nachruf auf Univ.Prof. DDr.h.c. Werner Leinfellner 1921 – 2010|url=http://www.alws.at/de/index.php/alws/kondolenzbuch_werner_leinfellner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific and philosophical work==

Although she was trained as a linguist, she had deep interests in philosophical questions. Her research interests were both broad and deep including political language, [[philosophy of language]] (especially [[Fritz Mauthner]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]), [[semantic networks]] and [[cognitive semantics]], political and feminist critique of language, [[rhetoric]] and [[argumentation theory]], the application of linguistics to the language of literature, and evolutionary mechanisms of the language development.  In particular, she focused on Ludwig Wittgenstein and the philosopher and writer Fritz Mauthner. However, she also published on causality and language, on [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas’]] theory of communicative competence from a linguistic point of view and on [[William Ockham|William Ockham’s]] and [[Franz Brentano|Franz Brentano’s]] work on semantics. Her book on euphemism in political language (''Der Euphemismus in der politischen Sprache'') is particular important. She also drew attention to texts and their meanings as evolutionary systems.&lt;ref name="arturo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Windholz"/&gt;&lt;ref name = EL/&gt;

Her research was intertwined with Werner Leinfellner’s and, therefore, it should not come as a surprise that they co-authored publications, most notably a book on ontology, systems theory and semantics (''Ontologie, Systemtheorie und Semantik''). This comprehensive book is an original attempt to connect the traditional philosophical field of [[ontology]] with a cognitive-recursive [[semantics]]. It reflects their broad knowledge in different academic areas as well as their abilities to synthesize ideas. Their book bridges the gap between ordinary language and the language of theories. It demonstrates that both are governed by the same semantic regularities.&lt;ref name="arturo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Windholz"/&gt;

'''Gedeo''' is a [[Highland East Cushitic]] language of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family spoken in south central [[Ethiopia]]. Alternate names for the language include Derasa, Deresa, Darassa, Geddeo, Derasanya, Darasa.  It is spoken by the [[Gedeo people]], who live in the highland area, southwest of [[Dila, Ethiopia|Dila]] and east of [[Lake Abaya]].&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.

'''Ignatius Aphrem I Barsoum''' (June 15, 1887 – June 23, 1957) was the 120th [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]] and head of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. He wrote, translated and published many scholarly works, including books on the tradition, liturgy, music, and history of [[Syriac Orthodox Church]].

==Early life and career==
He was born in [[Mosul]], [[Ottoman Empire]], and attended a school run by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monks. He studied [[French language|French]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as well as religious literature and history, and later learned Arabic from studies under Muslim scholars. At the Deir al-Za`faran monastery in [[Mardin]], [[Turkey]], where he started his [[theological]] training in 1905, he studied the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] language and literature.

After his ordination as a priest in 1908, he remained at the [[monastery]] to teach, and in 1911 he assumed the additional responsibility of managing the monastery press. Later that year he began a scholar's visit to the monasteries and churches of [[Mesopotamia]] and Turkey. Soon after his return in 1913 he made a similar trip to examine [[Syriac language|Syriac]] manuscripts in the great libraries of Europe.

==Episcopal career==

On May 20, 1918, [[Patriarch]] [[Ignatius Elias III]] consecrated Aphrem as metropolitan [[Mor Severius]] and named him the [[bishop]] of Syria. Rev. Joel E. Werda led the Assyrian delegation from the USA, representing the Diaspora community in Paris Peace Conference, 1919. He accompanied Bishop Aphrem Barsoum and his secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20060616121030.htm|title=Assyrians in the World War I Treaties: Paris, Sèvres, and Lausanne|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was disillusioned, however, by the atmosphere of self-interest which prevailed among the delegates representing the [[European power]]s, and at one stage of the conference found himself defending not only the rights of the Assyrians, but those of the Arab nations. Though Mor Severius did not succeed in protecting the Assyrian's interests at Paris, the journey gave him ample opportunity for further study of Syriac literature before his return in May, 1920. Two years later, the [[League of Nations]]' action making [[Syria]] a French mandate brought him the new responsibility of providing for refugees from Cilicia, and he also undertook the building of many new churches in and near [[Aleppo]].

Another journey took Mor Severius to [[Geneva]] and [[Lausanne]] as an [[apostolic delegate]] to the [[World Conference on Faith and Order]] (August 3–21, 1927). Soon afterwards he came as an emissary of the [[Patriarch]] to the [[United States]], where he investigated the condition of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], consecrated three new churches, and ordained new priests. He also gave lectures on the Syriac language and literature at the Providence University and the [[University of Chicago]], and served at the Oriental Institute of the latter institution until his return in 1929.

==Patriarchal Consecration==

After the death of Patriarch [[Ignatius Elias III]] in 1932, the [[Synod]] of Bishops named Mor Severius his acting successor. On January 30, 1933, he was formally elected [[Patriarch of Antioch]], assuming the ecclesiastical name of Mor Ignatius Aphrem I Barsoum. The new [[Patriarch]] quickly showed himself as an active Church head, establishing new dioceses and founding a theological seminary at Zahla, Lebanon (later moved to Mosul, and then to Beirut). In the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the political situation in the new state of Turkey, where Deir al-Za`faran, the seat of the Patriarchate, was located, Mor Aphrem was forced to relocate the Patriarchate to [[Homs]] in Syria. The great Patriarch died on June 23, 1957 and was buried in Homs.

==Literary works==

Despite the numerous responsibilities of his work in the [[Christian Church|Church]] and frequent interruptions for travel, the Patriarch devoted much of his time to writing.

Patriarch Aphrem produced many other works which have never been published. His [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-[[Arabic]] lexicon and his compendium of church history in the 20th century are written in both Syriac and Arabic. His history of [[Tur Abdin]], in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], was translated into Arabic by Bishop Bahnam. In Arabic, he also wrote a history of the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch|Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch]] and the famous men of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], a history of [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] dioceses, an index of [[Syriac language|Syriac]] manuscripts, and translations of ten liturgies of the [[Syriac Christianity]]. Also, he translated into Arabic the second part of the Ecclesiastical History of Bar `Ebroyo in 1909 when he was a monk at the [[Monastery]] of Za`faran.

===The Scattered Pearls===
'''''The Scattered Pearls: history of Syriac literature and sciences''''' ({{lang-ar|اللؤلؤ المنثور في تاريخ العلوم والآداب السريانية}}) is a survey of  [[Syriac literature]]; the review was written in the 1920s by Barsoum. The book was translated to several languages, the English by Matti Musa in 2003 ([[Gorgias Press]] {{ISBN|1-931956-04-9}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ighnāṭyūs Afrām I|first1=Patriarch of Antioch|title=The scattered pearls: a history of Syriac literature and sciences|url=http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/OXVU1:LSCOP_OX:oxfaleph015656179|publisher=Gorgias Press|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:P3030027ParkingLot wb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Parking lot]]s are highly impervious.]]
'''Impervious surfaces''' are mainly artificial structures—such as [[Pavement (material)|pavement]]s ([[road]]s, [[sidewalk]]s, [[driveway]]s and [[parking lot]]s, as well as industrial areas such as [[airport]]s, [[port]]s and [[logistics]] and [[distribution centre]]s, all of which use considerable paved areas) that are covered by impenetrable materials such as [[asphalt]], [[concrete]], [[brick]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]]—and [[roof]]tops. Soils compacted by urban [[land development|development]] are also highly impervious.

==Environmental effects==
Impervious surfaces are an [[Natural environment|environment]]al concern because, with their construction, a chain of events is initiated that modifies urban air and water resources:

* The pavement materials seal the [[soil]] surface, eliminating rainwater [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] and natural [[groundwater recharge]]. From a recent article in the ''[[Seattle Times]]'': "While urban areas cover only 3 percent of the U.S., it is estimated that their runoff is the primary source of pollution in 13 percent of rivers, 18 percent of lakes and 32 percent of estuaries."&lt;ref&gt;Cappiello, Dina. [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008272441_stormwater16m.html "Report: EPA Failing to stop Sprawl Runoff."] Seattle Times, 16 Oct. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
:Some of these pollutants include excess nutrients from [[fertilizer]]s; [[pathogens]] pet waste; [[gasoline]], [[motor oil]], and [[heavy metals]] from vehicles; high [[sediment]] loads from stream bed erosion and [[construction]] sites, and [[waste]] such as cigarette butts, 6-pack holders and plastic bags carried by surges of [[stormwater]]. In some cities, the flood waters get into [[combined sewer]]s, causing them to overflow, flushing their raw sewage into streams. Polluted [[urban runoff|runoff]] can have many negative effects on fish, animals, plants and people.

* Impervious surfaces collect [[Solar heating|solar heat]] in their dense mass. When the heat is released, it raises air temperatures, producing [[urban heat island|urban "heat islands"]], and increasing energy consumption in buildings. The warm runoff from impervious surfaces reduces dissolved [[oxygen]] in stream water, making life difficult in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s.
* Impervious pavements deprive tree roots of aeration, eliminating the "urban forest" and the canopy shade that would otherwise moderate urban climate. Because impervious surfaces displace living vegetation, they reduce [[ecology|ecological]] [[Natural capital|productivity]], and interrupt [[Carbon cycle|atmospheric carbon cycling]].

[[Image:Panorama clip3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Most urban [[roof]]tops are completely impervious.]]
The total coverage by impervious surfaces in an area, such as a municipality or a [[drainage basin|watershed]] is usually expressed as a percentage of the total land area. The coverage increases with rising [[urbanization]]. In rural areas, impervious cover may only be one or two percent. In residential areas, coverage increases from about 10 percent in low-density [[subdivision (land)|subdivisions]] to over 50 percent in multi-family communities. In industrial and commercial areas, coverage rises above 70 percent. In regional [[shopping center]]s and dense urban areas, it is over 90 percent. In the contiguous 48 states of the USA, urban impervious cover adds up to 43,000 square miles (110,000&amp;nbsp;km²) — an area nearly the size of the State of [[Ohio]]. Continuing development adds another quarter of a million acres (1,000&amp;nbsp;km²) each year. Typically two-thirds of the cover is pavements and one-third is building roofs.&lt;ref&gt;Schueler, Thomas R. [http://www.cwp.org/Resource_Library/Center_Docs/PWP/ELC_PWP1.pdf "The Importance of Imperviousness."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227110104/http://www.cwp.org/Resource_Library/Center_Docs/PWP/ELC_PWP1.pdf |date=2009-02-27 }} Reprinted in [http://www.cwp.org/Store/guidance.htm ''The Practice of Watershed Protection.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223004441/http://www.cwp.org/Store/guidance.htm |date=2008-12-23 }} 2000. Center for Watershed Protection. Ellicott City, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation of environmental impacts==
Impervious surface coverage can be limited by restricting [[land use]] density (such as number of homes per acre in a subdivision), but this approach causes land elsewhere (outside the subdivision) to be developed, to accommodate growing population. (See ''[[urban sprawl]].'') Alternatively, urban structures can be built differently to make them function more like naturally pervious soils; examples of such alternative structures are [[Permeable paving|porous pavements]], [[green roof]]s and [[infiltration basin]]s.

Rainwater from impervious surfaces can be collected in [[rainwater tank]]s and used in place of main water.

Partly in response to recent criticism by [[municipalities]], a number of concrete manufacturers such as CEMEX and Quikrete have begun producing permeable materials which partly mitigate the environmental impact of conventional impervious concrete. These new materials are composed of various combinations of naturally derived [[solid]]s including fine to coarse-grained [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s and [[mineral]]s, [[organic material|organic matter]] (including [[life|living organisms]]), [[ice]], weathered rock and [[precipitates]], [[liquid]]s primarily [[water]] [[solutions]], and [[gases]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Carter, 2006, ''Anti-Impervious Surfaces: The Ecological Impact of Concrete Alternatives'', Troy, NY: Luminopf Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Percentage imperviousness ==
The percentage imperviousness, often referred to as PIMP in calculations, is an important factor when considering drainage of water. It is calculated by measuring the percentage of a catchment area which is made up of impervious surfaces such as roads, roofs and other paved surfaces. An estimation of PIMP is given by PIMP = 6.4J^0.5 where J is the number of dwellings per hectare (Butler and Davies 2000). For example, woodland has a PIMP value of 10%, whereas dense commercial areas have a PIMP value of 100%. This variable is used in the [[Flood Studies Report#Flood Estimation Handbook|Flood Estimation Handbook]].

[[File:Graph of Impervious Surfaces Coverage in the US.png|thumb|right|Graph of impervious surface coverage in the US.&lt;ref name="Homer, 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Granato, 2010 TIA" /&gt;]]
Homer and others (2007) indicate that about 76 percent of the conterminous United States is classified as having less than 1 percent impervious cover, 11 percent with impervious cover of 1 to 10 percent, 4 percent with an estimated impervious cover of 11 to 20 percent, 4.4 percent with an estimated impervious cover of 21 to 40 percent, and about 4.4 percent with an estimated impervious cover greater than 40 percent.&lt;ref name ="Homer, 2007"&gt;Homer, C., Dewitz, J., Fry, J., Coan, M., Hossain, N., Larson, C., Herold, N., McKerrow, A., VanDriel, J.N., and Wickham, J., 2007, Completion of the 2001 National land cover database for the conterminous United States: Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, v. 73, no. 4, p. 337-341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Granato, 2010 TIA"&gt;Granato, G.E., 2010, ''Overview of Methods Used to Estimate Imperviousness in a Drainage Basin'' '''Appendix 6 in''' ''Methods for development of planning-level estimates of stormflow at unmonitored sites in the conterminous United States'': Federal Highway Administration, FHWA-HEP-09-005  [http://webdmamrl.er.usgs.gov/g1/fhwa/SELDM.htm "Available on-line."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906124839/http://webdmamrl.er.usgs.gov/g1/fhwa/SELDM.htm |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Total impervious area ==
The total impervious area (TIA) can be expressed as a fraction (from zero to one) or a percentage. There are many methods for estimating TIA, including the use of the National Land Cover Data Set (NLCD)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd2011.php National Land Cover Data Set (NLCD)]&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Geographic information system]], land-use categories with categorical TIA estimates, a generalized percent developed area, and relations between population density and TIA.&lt;ref name ="Granato, 2010 TIA" /&gt;

The U.S. NLCD impervious surface data set may provide a high-quality nationally-consistent land cover data set in a GIS-ready format that can be used to estimate TIA value.&lt;ref name ="Granato, 2010 TIA" /&gt; The NLCD consistently quantifies the percent anthropogenic TIA for the NLCD at a 30-meter (a 900 m2) pixel resolution throughout the Nation. Within the data set, each pixel is quantified as having a TIA value that ranges from 0 to 100 percent. TIA estimates made with the NLCD impervious surface data set represent an aggregated TIA value for each pixel rather than a TIA value for an individual impervious feature. For example, a two lane road in a grassy field has a TIA value of 100 percent, but the pixel containing the road would have a TIA value of 26 percent. If the road (equally) straddles the boundary of two pixels, each pixel would have a TIA value of 13 percent. The Data-quality analysis of the NLCD 2001 data set with manually delimited TIA sample areas indicates that the average error of predicted versus actual TIA may range from 8.8 to 11.4 percent.&lt;ref name ="Homer, 2007" /&gt;

TIA estimates from land use are made by identifying land use categories for large blocks of land, summing the total area of each category, and multiplying each area by a characteristic TIA coefficient.&lt;ref name ="Granato, 2010 TIA" /&gt; Land use categories commonly are used to estimate TIA because areas with a common land use can be identified from field studies, from maps, from planning and zoning information, and from remote imagery. Land use coefficient methods commonly are used because planning and zoning maps that identify similar areas are, increasingly, available in GIS formats. Also, land use methods are selected to estimate potential effects of future development on TIA with planning maps that quantify projected changes in land use.&lt;ref&gt;Cappiella, K., and Brown, K., 2001, Land use and impervious cover in the Chesapeake Bay region: Watershed Protection Techniques, v. 3, no. 4, p. 835-840.&lt;/ref&gt; There are substantial differences in actual and estimated TIA estimates from different studies in the literature. Terms like low density and high density may differ in different areas.&lt;ref&gt;Hitt, K.J., 1994, Refining 1970's land use data with 1990 population data to indicate new residential development: U.S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 94-4250, 15 p.&lt;/ref&gt; A residential density of one-half acre per house may be classified as high density in a rural area, medium density in a suburban area, and low density in an urban area. Granato (2010)&lt;ref name ="Granato, 2010 TIA" /&gt; provides a table with TIA values for different land-use categories from 30 studies in the literature.

The percent developed area (PDA) is commonly used to estimate TIA manually by using maps.&lt;ref name ="Granato, 2010 TIA" /&gt; The Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLCC) defines a developed area as being covered by at least 30 percent of constructed materials&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2009, National Land Cover Data (NLCD) Classification Schemes [http://www.epa.gov/mrlc/definitions.html "Available on-line"]&lt;/ref&gt;). Southard (1986)&lt;ref&gt;Southard, R.E., 1986, An alternative basin characteristic for use in estimating impervious area in urban Missouri basins: U.S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 86-4362, 21 p.&lt;/ref&gt; defined non-developed areas as natural, agricultural, or scattered residential development. He developed a regression equation to predict TIA using percent developed area (table 6-1). He developed his equation using logarithmic power function with data from 23 basins in Missouri. He noted that this method was advantageous because large basins could quickly be delineated and TIA estimated manually from available maps. Granato (2010)&lt;ref name ="Granato, 2010 TIA" /&gt; developed a regression equation by using data from 262 stream basins in 10 metropolitan areas of the conterminous United States with drainage areas ranging from 0.35 to 216 square miles and PDA values ranging from 0.16 to 99.06 percent.
 
TIA also is estimated from population density data by estimating the population in an area of interest and using regression equations to calculate the associated TIA.&lt;ref name ="Granato, 2010 TIA" /&gt; Population-density data are used because nationally consistent census-block data are available in GIS formats for the entire United States. Population-density methods also can be used for predicting potential effects of future development. Although there may be substantial variation in relations between population density and TIA the accuracy of such estimates tend to improve with increasing drainage area as local variations are averaged out.&lt;ref&gt;Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District, 1999, Assessment of current and future GVS&amp;DD area watershed and catchment conditions--Burnaby, Vancouver British Columbia, Canada, Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District, 53 p. available at: [http://www.gvrd.bc.ca/sewerage/stormwater_reports_1997_2002/assessment/main_rpt/assessment_watersheds_catchments.pdf "Available on line"]&lt;/ref&gt; Granato (2010)&lt;ref name ="Granato, 2010 TIA" /&gt; provides a table with 8 population-density relations from the literature and a new equation developed by using data from 6,255 stream basins in the USGS GAGESII dataset.&lt;ref&gt;Falcone, James, Stewart, J., Sobieszczyk, S., Dupree, J., McMahon, G., and Buell, G., 2007, A comparison of natural and urban characteristics and the development of urban intensity indices across six geographic settings: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2007-5123, 43 p.&lt;/ref&gt;  Granato (2010)&lt;ref name ="Granato, 2010 TIA" /&gt; also provides four equations to estimate TIA from housing density, which is related to population density.

== Natural impervious area ==

Natural impervious areas are defined herein as [[land cover]]s that can contribute a substantial amount of [[stormflow]] during small and large storms, but commonly are classified as pervious areas.&lt;ref name ="Granato, 2010 TIA" /&gt; These areas are not commonly considered as an important source of stormflow in most highway and [[urban runoff]]-quality studies, but may produce a substantial amount of stormflow. These natural impervious areas may include open water, [[wetland]]s, rock outcrops, barren ground (natural soils with low imperviousness), and areas of [[soil compaction|compacted soils]]. Natural impervious areas, depending on their nature and antecedent conditions, may produce stormflow from infiltration excess overland flow, saturation overland flow, or direct precipitation. The effects of natural impervious areas on runoff generation are expected to be more important in areas with low [[#Total Impervious Area (TIA)|TIA]] than highly developed areas. 

The [[NLCD]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Geological Survey, 2007, The USGS Land Cover Institute NLCD land cover statistics database--View the NLCD land cover statistics database [http://landcover.usgs.gov/nlcd.php "Available on line"]&lt;/ref&gt; provides land-cover statistics that can be used as a qualitative measure of the prevalence of different land covers that may act as natural impervious areas. Open water may act as a natural impervious area if direct precipitation is routed through the channel network and arrives as stormflow at the site of interest. Wetlands may act as a natural impervious area during storms when groundwater discharge and saturation overland flow are a substantial proportion of stormflow. Barren ground in riparian areas may act as a natural impervious area during storms because these areas are a source of infiltration excess overland flows. Seemingly pervious areas that have been affected by development activities may act as
impervious areas and generate infiltration excess overland flows. These stormflows may occur even during storms that do not meet precipitation volume or intensity criteria to produce runoff based on nominal infiltration rates. 

Developed pervious areas may behave like impervious areas because [[land development|development]] and subsequent use tends to compact soils and reduce infiltration rates. For example, Felton and Lull (1963)&lt;ref&gt;Felton, P.M., and Lull, H.W., 1963, Suburban hydrology can improve watershed conditions: Journal of Public Works, v. 94, p. 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt; measured infiltration rates for forest soils and lawns to indicate a potential 80 percent reduction in infiltration as a result of development activities. Similarly, Taylor (1982)&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, C.H. 1982, The effect on storm runoff response of seasonal variations in contributing zones in small
watersheds (Ontario): Nordic Hydrology, v. 13, no. 3, p. 165-182.&lt;/ref&gt; did [[infiltrometer]] tests in areas before and after suburban development and noted that topsoil alteration and compaction by construction activities reduced infiltration rates by more than 77 percent.

An '''incumbent local exchange carrier''' ('''ILEC''') is a local [[telephone]] company which held the regional [[monopoly]] on landline service before the market was opened to [[competitive local exchange carrier]]s, or the corporate successor of such a firm. In much of the [[United States]], these were originally [[Bell System]] companies, although various regional independents (including [[GTE]]) in the US held incumbent monopolies in their respective regions.

==In the United States==

In the [[United States]], these were companies in existence at the time of [[Bell System divestiture|the breakup of AT&amp;T]] into the [[Regional Bell Operating Companies]] (RBOCs), also known as the "Baby Bells".&lt;ref name = BellBreakUp&gt;{{ cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/01/us/bell-system-breakup-opens-era-of-great-expectations-and-great-concern.html |title= Bell System Break-Up Opens Era Of Great Expectations and Great Concern |author=Andrew Pollack |date=1 January 1984 |publisher=''The New York Times'' |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GTE]] was the second largest ILEC after the Bells, but it has since been absorbed into [[Verizon]], an [[RBOC]]. In some areas, an [[independent telephone company]] is responsible for providing local telephone exchange services in a specified geographic area.

==In Canada==

In [[Canada]], ILECs are the original telephone companies such as [[Telus]] ([[BC Tel]] and [[Alberta Government Telephones]]), [[SaskTel]], [[Manitoba Telecom Services|Manitoba Telephone Systems]] (MTS Allstream), [[Bell Canada]] and [[Bell Aliant|Aliant]], as well as any other company that previously held a monopoly to serve a community and continues to do so, or a successor company if it is bought and absorbed.  ILECs are obligated to serve the entire exchange area as a "provider of last resort", while [[Competitive local exchange carrier|CLECs]] can choose which locations to serve, be it by facilities of their own or by resale of services of an ILEC or another CLEC.
* Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan – originally established by Bell Canada and small area independent companies; all purchased by the provincial governments (Alberta, in the 1906–1908 period; Manitoba, circa 1908; Saskatchewan, 1908–1909 period) and developed into a complete service to all communities, as the ILECs; Alberta's privatized as Telus in the 1990s, Manitoba's in 1997, while Saskatchewan's remains a crown corporation
* British Columbia - originally established as several independent companies; amalgamated by GTE as B.C. Tel with the second-last private independent being acquired circa 1980, as the ILEC; merged with Telus in 1999; Northwestel was the ILEC in the northern area as service was initiated by the U.S. Army in 1942, then eventually turned over to government and crown corporation entities; Prince Rupert City Tel remains the only ILEC not associated with either
* New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, P.E.I. - established by Bell Canada and small area independent companies; Bell operations sold off in 1888-89 to separate companies which eventually consolidated their operations to absorb most independents (last NB independent bought in 1973); Bell acquired interests in the companies during the 1960s, which are the ILECs, though they merged into a single company covering four provinces including Newfoundland.
* Newfoundland - private companies, mostly small, with one that eventually acquired the other small companies; government developed a system that served smaller communities, and which was taken over by a federal crown corporation in 1950, then sold to the remaining large private company in 1988, becoming the ILEC that merged with the three Maritime companies
* Ontario and Quebec - private companies, Bell Canada being the dominant one; Bell purchased several of the small independents through the years; other independents amalgamated; this mix became the array of ILECs in the 1990s
* Territories - some independent companies in the west, plus US Army system which came under crown corporation in 1948; from 1958–64, independent companies acquired by the crown corporation that would be Northwestel as of 1979, and developed in remaining communities; Bell Canada developed services in eastern area, then sold to Northwestel in 1992; Northwestel becomes ILEC with introduction of local competition in 2007.

==Definition==
An ILEC, with respect to an area in the United States, is a [[local exchange carrier]] (LEC) that:
* On the date of enactment of the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], provided telephone exchange service in such area
* And on such date of enactment, was deemed to be a member of the [[National Exchange Carrier Association]] pursuant to the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (C.F.R) [[Telecommunications|Title 47]], section 69.601(b).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2004/octqtr/47cfr69.601.htm |title=47CFR69.601 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Or is a person or entity that, on or after such date of enactment, became a successor or assignee of a member described in the previous bullet.

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) may, by rule, provide for the treatment of an LEC (or class or category thereof) as an ILEC if:
* Such carrier occupies a position in the market for telephone exchange service within an area that is comparable to the position occupied by a carrier described previously
* Such carrier has substantially replaced an ILEC described previously
* Such treatment is consistent with the [[public interest]], convenience and necessity

==Duties==
ILECs have the same duties of a LEC and in addition:
* Duty to negotiate - The duty to negotiate in [[good faith]] the particular terms and conditions of agreements to fulfill the duties described for a LEC and the specific ones for the ILEC. The requesting telecommunications carrier also has the duty to negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of such agreements.
* [[Interconnection]] - The duty to provide, for the [[Facility (telecommunications)|facilities]] and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier, interconnection with the LEC's network -
** For the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access
** At any technically feasible point within the carrier's network
** That is at least equal in quality to that provided by the LEC to itself or to any subsidiary, affiliate or any other party to which the carrier provides interconnection
** On rates, terms and conditions that are just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement
* [[Local loop unbundling|Unbundled]] access - The duty to provide, to any requesting telecommunications carrier for the provision of a telecommunications service, nondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point on rates, terms and conditions that are just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement. An ILEC shall provide such unbundled [[network element]]s in a manner that allows requesting carriers to combine such elements in order to provide such telecommunications service.
* Resale - The duty
** To offer for resale at wholesale rates any telecommunications service that the carrier provides at retail to subscribers who are not telecommunications carriers
** Not to prohibit, and not to impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on, the resale of such telecommunications service,
* Notice of changes - The duty to provide reasonable public notice of changes in the information necessary for the transmission and routing of services using that local exchange carrier's facilities or networks, as well as of any other changes that would affect the interoperability of those facilities and networks.
* [[Colocation centre|Colocation]] - The duty to provide, on rates, terms and conditions that are just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, for physical colocation of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at the premises of the local exchange carrier, except that the carrier may provide for virtual colocation if the LEC demonstrates that physical colocation is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations.

{{Nihongo|'''Japanese Sign Language'''|日本手話|Nihon Shuwa}}, also known by the acronym '''JSL''', is the dominant [[sign language]] in [[Japan]].

==History==
Little is known about [[sign language]] and the [[deaf]] community before the [[Edo period]]. In 1862, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] dispatched envoys to various European schools for the deaf but the first school for the deaf was not established until 1878 in [[Kyōto]].

Until 1948, deaf children were not required to attend school or to receive a formal education.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, Leila Frances. (2003). {{Google books|aUIqOlcbZ6QC|''Many Ways to be Deaf: International Variation in Deaf Communities,'' p. 211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 20th century, a subtle cultural change in views about the Deaf in Japan evolved.  The long-standing concept that "deaf" only means "people who can't hear" emphasized a physical impairment as part of a biomedical disease model; however, this was gradually replaced by a slightly different paradigm.  "Deaf people" were more often identified as "people who use Japanese sign language".  In other words, the biomedical disability model began slowly to be displaced by a social-cultural or JSL paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Karen. (2006). ''Deaf in Japan: Signing and the Politics of Identity,'' p. 9, citing Kimura, Harumi and Yasuhiro Ichida. 1995. "''Roubunka Sengen''" (An Explanation of Deaf Culture), ''Gendai Shisou'', Vol. 23, No. 3, pp. 354–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japanese Federation of the Deaf]] has worked with slow success in efforts to enhance communication opportunities for Japanese whose primary language is JSL.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Karen. [http://ssjj.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/17.abstract  "Resistance and Co‐optation: the Japanese Federation of the Deaf and its Relations with State Power"]. ''Social Science Japan Journal'' (SSJJ) (2002) Vol. 5, No. 1, pp. 17–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The changing status of JSL and the Deaf in Japan is a slow process; but there are highlights.  For example, JSL has an advocate among the Imperial family. [[Kiko, Princess Akishino]] has studied JSL and is a trained sign language interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;Valpy, Michael. [http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090627.escenic_1199494/BNStory/National/MICHAEL+VALPY?pageRequested=all  "The emperor and the tennis pro"]. ''Globe and Mail'' (Canada). June 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  She attends the Sign Language Speech Contest for High School Students held every August, and Praising Mothers Raising Children with Hearing Impairments every December.  In October 2008, she participated in the 38th National Deaf Women's Conference.&lt;ref&gt;Imperial Household Agency. [http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-about/activity/activity03.html  Their Imperial Highnesses Prince and Princess Akishino]&lt;/ref&gt;  She also signs in informal Deaf gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deafjapan.blogspot.com/2010/09/princess-kiko-chats-with-deaf-soccer.html  "Princess Kiko chats with Deaf soccer players in sign language after film show"]. ''Deaf Japan News''. September 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deaf community supported passage of the proposed Sign Language Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deafjapan.blogspot.com/2010/11/deaf-community-requests-enactment-of.html  "Deaf community requests enactment of the sign language law"]. ''Deaf Japan News''. November 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Basic Act for Persons with Disabilities" was enacted in 2011.  This law recognized sign language as a language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfd.or.jp/en/2011/09/16/pid1488  "Sign Language Stated in Law!" at jfd.or.jp]; excerpt, "Every person with disabilities, wherever possible, shall be ensured opportunities to choose his or her language (including sign language) and/or other means of communication, and the expansion of opportunities to choose his or her means of acquiring or utilizing information shall be promoted."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpreters===
The slow integration of JSL within the context of Japanese culture has been accompanied by an expansion of the numbers of sign language interpreters:

* 1991: Japanese Association of Sign Language Interpreters (JASLI) established&lt;ref name="jasli_1"&gt;Japanese Association of Sign Language Interpreters, [http://www.jasli.jp/about01e.html  Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107163547/http://www.jasli.jp/about01e.html |date=2010-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1997: Ethics code of the Sign Language Interpreters established by JASLI&lt;ref name="jasli_1"/&gt;
* 2002: Japanese Federation of the Deaf and the National Research Association for Sign Language Interpretation established the National Training Institution of Sign Language&lt;ref name="jasli_1"/&gt;

In 2006, the Japanese government amended the Supporting Independence of People with Disabilities Act.  The new language in the law encourages local governments to increase the number and use of JSL interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;Saruhashi, Junko and Yuko Takeshita. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/42/41519261.pdf  "Ten Linguistic Issues in Japan: The Impact of Globalization"]. [http://www.oecd.org/pages/0,3417,en_36734052_36734103_1_1_1_1_1,00.html  Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
As in other sign languages, JSL (usually called simply 手話 ''shuwa'', "hand talk") consists of words, or signs, and the grammar with which they are put together. JSL signs may be nouns, verbs, adjectives, or any other part of a sentence, including suffixes indicating [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[negation]], and [[grammatical particles]]. Signs consist not just of a manual gesture, but also {{Nihongo|''mouthing''|口話|kōwa|"mouth talk"}} (pronouncing a standard Japanese word with or without making a sound). The same sign may assume one of two different but [[Semantics|semantically related]] meanings, as for example in "home" and "house", according to its [[mouthing]]. Another indispensable part of many signs is facial expression.

[[File:TSU-jsl-yubimoji.png|thumb|right|The ''yubimoji'' "tsu" imitates the shape of the [[katakana]] character {{Nihongo|"tsu"|ツ}}.]]
In addition to signs and their grammar, JSL is augmented by {{Nihongo|[[yubimoji]]|指文字|"finger letters"}}, a form of [[fingerspelling]], which was introduced from the [[United States]] in the early part of the twentieth century, but is used less often than in [[American Sign Language]]. Each ''yubimoji'' corresponds to a ''[[kana]]'', as illustrated by the [[Japanese Sign Language syllabary|JSL syllabary]]. Fingerspelling is used mostly for foreign words, last names, and unusual words. {{Nihongo|[[Pantomime]]|身振り|miburi|"gestures"}} is used to cover situations where existing signs are not sufficient.

Because, like the standard [[Japanese language|Japanese]] from which it partly derives, JSL is strongly influenced by the complex [[Japanese writing system]], it dedicates particular attention to the written language and includes elements specifically designed to express ''[[kanji]]'' in signs. For either conciseness or disambiguation, particular signs are associated with certain commonly used ''kanji'', place names, and sometimes surnames. {{Nihongo|Finger writing|空書|kūsho|"air writing"}} (tracing ''kanji'' in the air) is also sometimes used for last names or place names, just as it is in spoken Japanese.

==Examples of signs==

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:JSLbaiku.gif|A noun: "bicycle"
File:JSLdesu001.gif|A verb: "to be"
File:JSLcyuu.gif|A Chinese character: {{nihongo|"middle"|中|naka, chū}}
File:JSLdesuka001.gif|A grammatical particle: interrogative sentence ending
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Other sign languages in use in Japan==
Besides JSL there are also [[Contact Sign|Pidgin Signed Japanese]] and [[Signed Japanese]]. Both of these are signed forms of the [[Japanese language]]. The first is used between non-native signers, and the latter is sometimes used in schools for the deaf. However, up to 2002, most Japanese schools for the deaf emphasized oral education, i.e. teaching through lip-reading. Even now, at least officially, JSL is not taught. It has been only a decade since the official school ban on the use of JSL was lifted.

The sign languages of [[Korean Sign Language|Korea]] and [[Taiwanese Sign Language|Taiwan]] share some signs with JSL, perhaps due to cultural transfer during the period of Japanese occupation. JSL has about a 60% lexical similarity with [[Taiwanese Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diffusion among the hearing==
Interest in sign language among the hearing population of Japan has been increasing, with numerous books now published targeting the hearing population, a weekly TV program teaching JSL, and the increasing availability of night school classes for the hearing to learn JSL. There have been several TV dramas, including ''[[Hoshi no Kinka]]'' (1995), in which signing has been a significant part of the plot, and sign language dramas are now a minor genre on Japanese TV.

The highly acclaimed 2006 [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]]–directed multiple [[Academy Award]]–nominated film ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'' also featured JSL as a significant element of the plot. Hearing actress [[Rinko Kikuchi]] received a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] nomination for her signing role in this film.

In Japan, about 40,000 signatures including both the hearing and deaf people have been collected to subtitle the scene in Babel spoken in Japanese for the deaf audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''yonmannin shomei haikyu ugokasu''|url=http://www.asahi.com/culture/movie/TKY200704280240.html|website=asahi|publisher=asahi|accessdate=13 February 2017|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anime school drama film "[[A Silent Voice (film)|A Silent Voice]]" (Japanese: 聲の形 Hepburn: Koe no Katachi, lit. ''The Shape of Voice''), released in 2016, features a prominent deaf JSL-speaking character, Shōko Nishimiya. It was produced by [[Kyoto Animation]], directed by [[Naoko Yamada]], written by [[Reiko Yoshida]], and featured character designs by [[Futoshi Nishiya]]. It is based on the [[A_Silent_Voice_(manga)|manga of the same name]] written and illustrated by [[Yoshitoki Ōima]]. The film premiered in Japan on September 17, 2016.

'''Kamal Kumar Majumdar''' ({{lang-bn|&lt;big&gt;কমলকুমার মজুমদার&lt;/big&gt;}}) (17 November 1914 – 9 February 1979) was a major fiction-writer of the [[Bengali language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UKfoHi5412UC | title = Calcutta: A Cultural and Literary History |author1=Krishna Dutta |author2=Anita Desai | publisher = Signal Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-902669-59-2 | page = 47 | accessdate =2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel ''Antarjali Jatra'' is considered his most notable work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sqBjpV9OzcsC | title = History of Indian Literature : [2].1911-1956, struggle for freedom : triumph and tragedy | author = Sisir Kumar Das, various | publisher = Sahitya Akademi | year = 1995 | isbn = 81-7201-798-7 | page = 504 | accessdate =2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Majumdar was the son of Prafullachandra Majumdar and Renukamoyee Majumdar. Prafullachandra used to serve in the police department. Renukamoyee had keen literary interest and thus Kamalkumar was exposed to modern literary thoughts and trends from his childhood.

His parents were originally from [[Taki (India)|Taki]], a town in the [[24 Parganas]] district (now in [[North 24 Parganas district]]), but the family shifted to Rikhia. Kamalkumar spent his childhood and adolescence in [[Kolkata]], India. He started his studies in a school called "Shiksha Sangha" in [[Bishnupur (South 24 Parganas)|Bishnupur]] but dropped formal studies before completing high school. For sometime, he studied [[Sanskrit]] in a ''[[Tol, Aurangabad|Tol]]'' and learned [[sitar]] from a local maestro. In 1937 he established a magazine called "Ushnish" where he used to write under his real name as well as a number of [[pen name]]s. But during 1944–45 he devoted himself mostly to painting. During 1937–38 he got numerous offers for going abroad which he refused.

Kamal Kumar was married to Dayamayee Majumdar and his younger brother was a renowned painter, [[Nirode Mazumdar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Ardhek Jibon | author = [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]] | publisher = Ananda Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their younger sister [[Shanu Lahiri]] (1928 – 2013) was also a noted painter and art educator.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Shanu Lahiri dead|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130202/jsp/calcutta/story_16510654.jsp#.UUISlTeEnuo|newspaper=Telegraph (Calcutta)|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only very rough estimates are possible.

[[SIL Ethnologue|SIL ''Ethnologue'']] gives estimates, broken down by dialect group, totalling 31 million, but with the caveat of "Very provisional figures for Northern Kurdish speaker population". ''Ethnologue'' estimates for dialect groups:
Northern: 20.2M (undated; 15M in Turkey for 2009),
Central: 6.75M (2009),
Southern: 3M (2000),
Laki: 1M (2000).
The Swedish ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'' listed Kurdish in its "Världens 100 största språk 2007" (The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007), citing an estimate of 20.6 million native speakers.

'''Kurdish''' ({{lang|kmr|Kurdî}}, کوردی; {{IPA-ku|ˈkuɾdiː|pron}}) is a [[dialect continuum|continuum]] of [[Western Iranian languages|Northwestern Iranian languages]] spoken by the [[Kurds]] in [[Western Asia]]. Kurdish forms three dialect groups known as [[Northern Kurdish]] ('''''Kurmanji'''''), [[Central Kurdish]] ('''''Sorani'''''), and [[Southern Kurdish]] ('''''Palewani'''''). A separate group of non-Kurdish Northwestern Iranian languages, the [[Zaza–Gorani languages]], are also spoken by several million Kurds.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Kaya, Mehmet.

The literary output in Kurdish was mostly confined to poetry until the early 20th century, when more general literature began to be developed. Today, there are two principal written Kurdish dialects, namely Northern Kurdish in the northern parts of the geographical region of [[Kurdistan]] and Central Kurdish further east and south. Central Kurdish is, along with [[Arabic]], one of the two official languages of [[Iraq]] and is in political documents simply referred to as "Kurdish".&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Christine. The Yezidi oral tradition in Iraqi Kurdistan. 2001. "However, it was the southern dialect of Kurdish, Sorani, the majority language of the Iraqi Kurds, which received sanction as an official language of Iraq."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node/194|title=Kurdish language issue and a divisive approach - Kurdish Academy of Language|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017021048/http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node%2F194|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification and origin==
The Kurdish languages belong to the [[Iranian languages|Iranian branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]]. They are generally classified as Northwestern Iranian languages, or by some scholars as intermediate between Northwestern and Southwestern Iranian.&lt;ref&gt;Gernot Windfuhr, ed., 2009. ''The Iranian Languages''.  Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin van Bruinessen]] notes that "Kurdish has a strong south-western Iranian element", whereas "Zaza and Gurani [...] do belong to the north-west Iranian group".&lt;ref&gt;Bruinessen, M.M. van. (1994). [http://www.let.uu.nl/~martin.vanbruinessen/personal/publications/Competing_Ethnic_Loyalties.htm Kurdish nationalism and competing ethnic loyalties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112203117/http://www.let.uu.nl/~martin.vanbruinessen/personal/publications/Competing_Ethnic_Loyalties.htm |date=12 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludwig Paul concludes that Kurdish seems to be a Northwestern Iranian language in origin,&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Kurdish language I. History of the Kurdish language|author-last=Paul|author-first=Ludwig|author-link=|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|editor-last=Yarshater|editor-first=Ehsan|editor-link=Ehsan Yarshater|volume=|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kurdish-language-i|accessdate=28 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111204130713/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kurdish-language-i|archivedate=4 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but acknowledges that it shares many traits with Southwestern Iranian languages like Persian, apparently due to longstanding and intense historical contacts.

Windfuhr identified Kurdish dialects as [[Parthian language|Parthian]], albeit with a [[Median language|Median]] substratum. Windfuhr and [[Richard N.

Nyberg II (Acta Iranica-5), Leiden: 457-471&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbuch der Altertumswissenschaft: Alter Orient-Griechische Geschichte-Römische Geschichte.

The present state of knowledge about Kurdish allows, at least roughly, drawing the approximate borders of the areas where the main ethnic core of the speakers of the contemporary Kurdish dialects was formed. The most argued hypothesis on the localisation of the ethnic territory of the Kurds remains [[David Neil MacKenzie|D.N. Mackenzie]]'s theory, proposed in the early 1960s (Mackenzie 1961). Developing the ideas of P. Tedesco (1921: 255) and regarding the common phonetic isoglosses shared by Kurdish, [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Baluchi language|Baluchi]], Mackenzie concluded that the speakers of these three languages may once have been in closer contact.

He has tried to reconstruct the alleged Persian-Kurdish-Baluchi linguistic unity presumably in the central parts of Iran. According to Mackenzie's theory, the Persians (or Proto-Persians) occupied the [[Fars Province|province of Fars]] in the southwest (proceeding from the assumption that the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] spoke Persian), the [[Baloch people|Baluchis]] (Proto-Baluchis) inhabited the central areas of Western Iran, and the Kurds (Proto-Kurds), in the wording of G. Windfuhr (1975: 459), lived either in northwestern [[Lorestān Province|Luristan]] or in the [[Isfahan Province|province of Isfahan]].&lt;ref&gt;Professor Garnik Asatrian (Yerevan University) (2009)."Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds", '''Iran and the Caucasus''', Vol.13, pp. 1–58, 2009 Published in 2009, Iran and the Caucasus, 13, pp.1-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdivisions==
Kurdish is divided into three groups, where dialects from different groups are not [[mutually intelligible]] without acquired bilingualism.&lt;ref&gt;Hassanpour, A. (1992). Nationalism and language in Kurdistan. San Francisco: Mellon Press. Also mentioned in: [http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node/712 kurdishacademy.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709211539/http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node%2F712 |date=9 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Postgate, J.N., Languages of Iraq, ancient and modern, [Iraq]: British School of Archaeology in Iraq, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-903472-21-0}}, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Northern Kurdish]] (Kurmanji) is the largest dialect group, spoken by an estimated 15 to 20 million Kurds in [[Kurds in Turkey|Turkey]], [[Kurds in Syria|Syria]], [[Kurds in Iraq|northern Iraq]], and [[Kurds in Iran|northwest and northeast Iran]].
*[[Central Kurdish]] (Sorani) is spoken by an estimated 6 to 7 million Kurds in much of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] and the Iranian [[Kurdistan Province]].&lt;ref name="kreyenbroek"&gt;Philip G. Kreyenbroek, "On the Kurdish Language", a chapter in the book ''The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview''. The book is previewable at [https://books.google.com/books?id=DkI1u4ta5w4C Google Book Search].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sorani]] is a written standard of Central Kurdish developed in the 1920s (named after the historical [[Soran Emirate]]) and was later adopted as the standard [[Kurdish alphabets|orthography]] of Kurdish as an official language of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Blau, ''Methode de Kurde: Sorani'', Editions L'Harmattan (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2aV7QiWQlfIC&amp;pg=PA20  p. 20]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Southern Kurdish]] (''Pehlewani'') is spoken by about 3 million Kurds in [[Kermanshah Province|Kermanshah]] and [[Ilam Province|Ilam]] provinces of Iran and in the [[Khanaqin]] district of eastern Iraq.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ranjbar, Vahid. Dastur-e Zaban-e Kurdi-ye Kermanshahi. Kermanshah: Taq-Bostan. 1388&lt;/ref&gt;
In historical evolution terms, Kurmanji is less modified than Sorani and Pehlewani in both phonetic and morphological structure. The Sorani group has been influenced by among other things its closer cultural proximity to the other languages spoken by Kurds in the region including the [[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Gorani language]] in parts of [[Iranian Kurdistan]] and [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].&lt;ref name="kreyenbroek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;D.N. MacKenzie, ''Language'' in ''Kurds &amp; Kurdistan'', Encyclopaedia of Islam.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kermanshahi group has been influenced by among other things its closer cultural proximity to Persian.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Philip G. Kreyenbroek, an expert writing in 1992, says:&lt;ref name=kreyenbroek/&gt;

{{bq|Since 1932 most Kurds have used the Roman script to write Kurmanji.... Sorani is normally written in an adapted form of the Arabic script.... Reasons for describing Kurmanji and Sorani as 'dialects' of one language are their common origin and the fact that this usage reflects the sense of ethnic identity and unity among the Kurds. From a linguistic or at least a grammatical point of view, however, Kurmanji and Sorani differ as much from each other as English and German, and it would seem appropriate to refer to them as languages. For example, Sorani has neither gender nor case-endings, whereas Kurmanji has both.... Differences in vocabulary and pronunciation are not as great as between German and English, but they are still considerable.}}

&lt;!-- remove this paragraph? --&gt;According to ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', although Kurdish is not a unified language, its many dialects are interrelated and at the same time distinguishable from other [[Western Iranian languages]]. The same source classifies different Kurdish dialects as two main groups, northern and central.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The reality is that the average Kurmanji speaker does not find it easy to communicate with the inhabitants of [[Sulaymaniyah]] or [[Halabja]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Some linguistic scholars assert that the term "Kurdish" has been applied extrinsically in describing the language the Kurds speak, whereas ethnic Kurds have used the word term to simply describe their ethnic or national identity and refer to their language as ''Kurmanji'', ''Sorani'', ''Hewrami'', ''Kermanshahi'', ''Kalhori'' or whatever other dialect or language they speak. Some historians have noted that it is only recently that the Kurds who speak the Sorani dialect have begun referring to their language as ''Kurdî'', in addition to their identity, which is translated to simply mean Kurdish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurdistanica.com/english/history/articles-his/his-articles-02.html ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501191513/http://www.kurdistanica.com/english/history/articles-his/his-articles-02.html |date=1 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mokriani dialect of Central Kurdish is widely spoken in Mokrian. Piranshahr and Mahabad are two principal cities of the Mokrian dialect area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissertation.xlibx.info/d1-other/240081-1-background-the-language-community-and-fieldwork-introduction-the.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305034800/http://www.dissertation.xlibx.info/d1-other/240081-1-background-the-language-community-and-fieldwork-introduction-the.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-03-05|title=BACKGROUND TO THE LANGUAGE, COMMUNITY, AND FIELDWORK 1.1 Introduction The present work is a grammatical description of the Mukri variety of Central|website=www.dissertation.xlibx.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zazaki and Gorani==
{{Main|Zaza language|Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)}}
Zaza–Gorani languages, which are spoken by communities in the wider area who identify as ethnic Kurds, are not linguistically classified as Kurdish.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gulf2000.columbia.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Books.google.com" /&gt; Zaza-Gorani is classified as adjunct to Kurdish, although authorities differ in the details. Windfuhr 2009{{page needed|date=December 2014}} groups Kurdish with Zaza Gorani within a "Northwestern I" group, while [[Glottolog]] based on ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]''
prefers an areal grouping of "Central dialects" (or "Kermanic") within Northwest Iranic, with Kurdish but not Zaza-Gorani grouped with "Kermanic".&lt;ref&gt;Glottolog 2.3, [http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/cent2264 Subfamily: Central Iran Kermanic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213173827/http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/cent2264 |date=13 December 2014 }}.

[[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Gorani]] is distinct from Northern and Central Kurdish, yet shares vocabulary with both of them and there are some grammatical similarities with Central Kurdish.&lt;ref&gt;Philip G. Kreyenbroek, "On the Kurdish Language", a chapter in the book The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hawrami dialects]] of Gorani includes a variety that was an important literary language since the [[14th century]], but it was replaced by Central Kurdish in the [[20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Meri, Josef W. Medieval Islamic Civilization: A-K, index. p444&lt;/ref&gt;

European scholars have maintained that Gorani is separate from Kurdish and that Kurdish is synonymous with the Northern Kurdish group, whereas ethnic Kurds maintain that Kurdish encompasses any of the unique languages or dialects spoken by Kurds that are not spoken by neighbouring ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Cecil. Kurds, Turks, and Arabs: politics, travel, and research in north-eastern Iraq, 1919–1925. Oxford University Press, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorani is classified as part of the Zaza–Gorani branch of Indo-Iranian languages.&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Postgate, Languages of Iraq, ancient and modern, British School of Archaeology in Iraq, [Iraq]: British School of Archaeology in Iraq, 2007, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zaza language]], spoken in the northernmost parts of Kurdistan, differs both grammatically and in vocabulary and is generally not understandable by Gorani speakers but it is considered related to Gorani.

==History==
&lt;!--[[File:Old Kurdish alphabet.png|thumb|Old alphabet used previously for Kurdish, according to Ibn Wahshiyya 856 AC.]]--&gt;

During his stay in [[Damascus]], historian [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] came across two books on agriculture written in Kurdish, one on the culture of the vine and the palm tree, and the other on water and the means of finding it out in unknown ground. He translated both from Kurdish into Arabic in the early 9th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ibn-Waḥšīya |first=Aḥmad Ibn-ʿAlī |authorlink= |others=Translated by  Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall|title=Ancient Alphabets and Hieroglyphic Characters Explained: With an Account of the Egyptian Priests, Their Classes, Initiation, and Sacrifices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8GZEAAAAcAAJ |accessdate=March 28, 2013 |year= 1806|publisher=Bulmer |location= |isbn= |page=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest Kurdish religious texts is the ''[[Yazidi Black Book]]'', the sacred book of [[Yazidi]] faith. It is considered to have been authored sometime in the 13th century AD by ''Hassan bin Adi'' (b. 1195 AD), the great-grandnephew of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir (d. 1162), the founder of the faith. It contains the Yazidi account of the creation of the world, the origin of man, the story of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] and the major prohibitions of the faith.&lt;ref&gt;Jonh S. Guest, ''The Yazidis: A Study In Survival'', Routledge Publishers, 1987, {{ISBN|0-7103-0115-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7103-0115-4}}, 299 pp. (see pages 18, 19, 32)&lt;/ref&gt; From the 15th to 17th centuries, classical Kurdish poets and writers developed a literary language. The most notable classical Kurdish poets from this period were [[Ali Hariri]], [[Ahmad Khani]], [[Malaye Jaziri]] and [[Faqi Tayran]].

The [[Italian people|Italian]] priest Maurizio Garzoni published the first Kurdish grammar titled ''Grammatica e Vocabolario della Lingua Kurda'' in [[Rome]] in 1787 after eighteen years of missionary work among the Kurds of [[Amadiya]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest R. McCarus, ''Kurdish Language Studies'', The Middle East Journal, Published by Middle East Institute, Washington, 1960, p.325&lt;/ref&gt;
This work is very important in Kurdish history as it is the first acknowledgment of the widespread use of a distinctive Kurdish language. Garzoni was given the title ''Father of Kurdology'' by later scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institutkurde.org/en/conferences/kurdish_studies_irbil_2006/Mirella+GALETTI.html#_ftn5 Kurdistan and Its Christians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210082050/http://www.institutkurde.org/en/conferences/kurdish_studies_irbil_2006/Mirella+GALETTI.html |date=10 February 2009 }}, Mirella Galetti, World Congress of Kurdish Studies, 6–9 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Kurdish language was banned in a large portion of Kurdistan for some time.

==Grammar==
{{main|Kurdish grammar}}

==Vocabulary==
The bulk of the vocabulary in Kurdish is of [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] origin, especially of [[northwestern Iranian]]. A considerable number of loanwords come from [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], mainly [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which entered through Islam and historical relations with Arab tribes. Yet, a smaller group of loanwords which are of [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Caucasian languages|Caucasian]], and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] origins are used in Kurdish, besides some European words. There are also Kurdish words with no clear etymology, some of which may be substratal remnants of ancient languages once spoken in the area, such as [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]].

==Writing system==
{{Main|Kurdish alphabets}}
[[File:Kurdish Food - Alder Street - geograph.org.uk - 1717250.jpg|thumb|Kurdish restaurant sign in [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]] written in [[Arabic script]]]]

The Kurdish language has been written using four different writing systems. In [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] it is written using an [[Kurdish alphabet#Sorani alphabet|Arabic script]], composed by [[Sa'id Kaban Sedqi]]. More recently, it is sometimes written with a [[Kurdish alphabet#Yekgirtú|Latin alphabet]] in Iraq. In Turkey, Syria, and [[Armenia]], it is now written using a [[Kurdish alphabet#Hawar alphabet|Latin script]]. Kurdish was also written in the Arabic script in Turkey and Syria until 1932. There is a proposal for a unified international recognized Kurdish alphabet based on [[ISO-8859-1]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node/2 |title=The Kurdish Unified Alphabet |publisher=www.kurdishacademy.org |accessdate=2 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524105517/http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node%2F2 |archivedate=24 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; called ''Yekgirtú''. Kurdish in the former [[USSR]] is written with a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]]. Kurdish has even been written in the [[Armenian alphabet]] in [[Soviet Armenia]] and in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (a translation of the Gospels in 1857&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://google.com/books?id=0zZMAAAAYAAJ |title=The Gospels in Kurdish in Armenian characters, 1857, Constantinople |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-02-18 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705171112/http://google.com/books?id=0zZMAAAAYAAJ |archivedate=5 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of all New Testament in 1872).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67652">[[ISO 639]] is a set of international standards that lists short codes for language names. The following is a complete '''list of three-letter codes''' defined in part two ('''ISO 639-2''') of the standard, including the corresponding two-letter ([[ISO 639-1]]) codes where they exist.

Where two ISO 639-2 codes are given in the table, the one with the asterisk is the [[ISO 639-2#B and T codes|bibliographic code]] (B code) and the other is the terminological code (T code).

Entries in the ''Scope'' and ''Type'' columns distinguish:
* [[list of languages by first written accounts|ancient languages]] (extinct since ancient times);
* collections of languages (which are connected, for example [[language family|genetically]] or by region)
* [[constructed language]]s;
* languages [[Language death|extinct]] in recent times;
* [[historical language]]s (distinct from their modern form);
* [[macrolanguage]]s.

The standard includes some codes for special situations:
* &lt;code&gt;mis&lt;/code&gt;, for "uncoded languages";
* &lt;code&gt;mul&lt;/code&gt;, for "multiple languages";
* &lt;code&gt;qaa-qtz&lt;/code&gt;, a range reserved for local use.
* &lt;code&gt;und&lt;/code&gt;, for "undetermined";
* &lt;code&gt;zxx&lt;/code&gt;, for "no linguistic content, not applicable";

'''Miju''' (Midžu, Miju, Mijhu), '''Midžuish''', '''Southern Mishmi''', or '''Geman''' languages are a small proposed family of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] spoken by the [[Miju Mishmi|Kaman (Miju Mishmi)]] people of southeastern [[Tibet]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. The languages are [[Kaman language|Kaman (Midzu/Miju)]] and [[Zakhring language|Zakhring (Meyor)]].&lt;ref&gt;George van Driem (2001) ''Languages of the Himalayas: An Ethnolinguistic Handbook of the Greater Himalayan Region.'' Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whereas Zakhring appears to be Sino-Tibetan, Kaman may be more divergent. Blench and Post (2011) believe that Zakhring is an [[East Bodish languages|East Bodish language]] that has been influenced by Midzu or other divergent languages of the region, whereas Kaman may be a [[language isolate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Roger |last1=Blench |first2=Mark |last2=Post |title=(De)classifying Arunachal languages: Reconstructing the evidence |url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/South%20Asia/NEI/General/Lingres/Declassifying%20Arunachal.pdf |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526230734/http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/South%20Asia/NEI/General/Lingres/Declassifying%20Arunachal.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blench (2015) suggests that Meyor (Zakhring) and Kman may each be [[language isolate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2015. [https://www.academia.edu/15754880/The_classification_of_Meyor_Zakhring_ The classification of Meyor (Zakhring)]. m.s.&lt;/ref&gt; Blench argues that the lexical similarities between Kman and Zakhring are borrowings, and that Zakhring had borrowed heavily from Kman and [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic]], and then later borrowed from [[Naga languages]] and Jingpho as well.

Regardless, they are not closely related to the Northern Mishmi also known as [[Digaro languages]].

[[File:ציון הרמק2.JPG|thumb|250px|Cordovero's grave in [[Safed]]]]

'''Moses ben Jacob Cordovero''' ({{lang-he-n|משה קורדובירו}} ''Moshe Kordovero'' &amp;lrm;; 1522–1570) was a central figure in the historical development of [[Kabbalah]], leader of a mystical school in 16th-century [[Safed]], [[Ottoman Syria]]. He is known by the [[Hebrew acronyms|acronym]] the '''Ramak''' ({{lang-he-n|רמ"ק}}).

After the Medieval flourishing of [[Kabbalah]], centered on the [[Zohar]], attempts were made to give a complete intellectual system to its theology, such as by [[Meir ben Ezekiel ibn Gabbai|Meir ibn Gabbai]]. Influenced by the earlier success of [[Jewish philosophy]] in articulating a rational study of Jewish thought, Moshe Cordovero produced the first full integration of the previous differing schools in Kabbalistic interpretation. While he was a mystic inspired by the opaque imagery of the Zohar, ''Cordoverian Kabbalah'' utilised the conceptual framework of [[Emanationism|evolving]] [[Ohr|cause and effect]] from the [[Ein Sof|Infinite]] to the [[Four Worlds|Finite]] in systemising Kabbalah, the method of philosophical style discourse he held most effective in describing a process that reflects sequential logic and coherence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/stages/stages3.htm The Development of Kabbalistic Thought: Evolution (Hishtalshelut) and the Kabbalah of the Ramak] www.inner.org&lt;/ref&gt; His encyclopedic works became a central stage in the development of Kabbalah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/stages/stages.htm The Development of Kabbalah in Three Stages] www.inner.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after him in Safed, [[Isaac Luria]] articulated a subsequent system of Kabbalistic theology, with new supra-rational doctrines recasting previous Kabbalistic thought. While Lurianism displaced the Cordoverian scheme and became predominant in Judaism, its followers read Cordoverian works in harmony with their teachings. Where to them, Lurianism described the "[[Four Worlds|World]]" of [[Tikun (Kabbalah)|Rectification]], Cordovero described the [[Tohu (Kabbalah)|pre-Rectification]] World.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Religion: A Companion'', Louis Jacobs, Oxford. Entries on Moshe Cordovero and Isaac Luria&lt;/ref&gt; Both articulations of the 16th century mystical Renaissance in Safed gave Kabbalah an intellectual prominence to rival Medieval [[Jewish philosophy|Rationalism]], whose social influence on Judaism had waned after the [[Expulsion from Spain]].

==Biography==
{{Kabbalah}}

===Early life===
The name Cordovero indicates that his family originated in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Spain]] and perhaps fled from there during the expulsion of 1492 during the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. His Hebrew signature, however (Cordoeiro), strongly suggests a long-lasting residence in Portugal.

The ''Ramak'' was either born in, or moved to [[Safed]] in the [[Land of Israel]], the city that was soon to become famed as a center of [[Kabbalah]] and mystical creativity. Albeit not involved in mystical studies until his twentieth year, RaMaK soon after gained a reputation of an extraordinary genius and a prolific writer. Besides his knowledge in Kabbalah, he was a [[Talmud]]ic scholar and a man of commanding mastery in [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophical]] thought who was respected in these fields. Contrary to popular belief, however, Ramak was not one of the rabbis who received the special [[semicha]] ("ordination") from Rabbi [[Jacob Berab]] in 1538, alongside Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] (Cordovero's teacher in [[Halakha]]), Rabbi [[Moshe of Trani]], Rabbi [[Yosef Sagis]], and Rabbi [[Moshe Alshich]]. As a whole, Ramak's contributions to posterity were in speculative and performative Kabballah, but during his lifetime he was the renowned head of the Yeshiva for Portuguese immigrants in Safed.

===Scholarship===
According to his own testimony in the introduction to "Pardes Rimonim", in 1542, at the age of twenty, Ramak heard a "Heavenly voice" urging him to study Kabbalah with his brother-in-law, Rabbi [[Shlomo Alkabetz]], composer of the mystical song [[Lecha Dodi]]. He was thus initiated into the mysteries of the [[Zohar]]. The young Ramak not only mastered the text, but decided to organize the Kabbalistic themes leading to his day and present them in an organized fashion. This led to the composition of his first book, ''[[Pardes Rimonim]]'' ("Orchard of Pomegranates"), which was completed in 1548 and secured Ramak's reputation as a brilliant Kabbalist and a lucid thinker. The ''Pardes'', as it is known, was a systemization of all Kabbalistic thought up to that time and featured the author's attempt at a reconciliation of various early schools with the conceptual teachings of the Zohar in order to demonstrate an essential unity and self-consistent philosophical basis of Kabbalah.&lt;ref&gt;Cordovero, M., "Pardes Rimonim", Parts 1-4, trans., Getz, E., Providence University, 2007, p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;

His second work - a [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] titled ''Ohr Yakar'' ("Precious Light") - was a 16 volume commentary on the Zoharic literature in its entirety and a work to which Ramak had devoted most of his life (the modern publication of this great work has started during the mid 1960s and reached partial fruition in 2004 [[Jerusalem]], though the 23-volume set left out about two-thirds of the [[Tikkunei Zohar]]; additional volumes are still being published). Some parts of Ohr Yakar have been published under separate titles, such as Shiur Qomah, Tefilah le-Moshe etc.

Some other books for which the Ramak is known are ''[[Tomer Devorah]]'' ("Palm Tree of Deborah"), in which he utilizes the Kabbalistic concepts of the [[Sephirot]] ("Divine attributes") to illuminate a system of morals and ethics; ''[[Ohr Neerav]]'', a justification of and insistence upon the importance of Kabbalah study and an introduction to the methods explicated in Pardes Rimonim;&lt;ref&gt;Cordovero, M., "Or Ne'erav", in Moses Cordovero's Introduction to Kabbalah: An Annotated Version of his "Or Ne'erav", trans. Robinson, I., Michael Scharf: Yeshiva University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Elimah Rabbati]]'', a highly abstract treatise on kabbalistic concerns revolving around the Godhead and His relationship to the Sefirot; and ''[[Sefer Gerushin]]'', a short and intimate composition which features the highly devotional slant of Ramak, as well as his [[Jewish asceticism|asceticism]] and religious piety. Certain parts of Ramak's works are still in form of manuscripts, whereas his existing writings suggest many other compositions which he either intended to write or had actually written - but were lost.

===Disciples===
Around 1550, the Ramak founded a Kabbalah academy in [[Safed]] (then in [[Ottoman Syria]]), which he led for twenty or so years, until his death. According to Jewish legend, it was reported that the prophet [[Elijah]] revealed himself to him. Among his disciples were many of the luminaries of Safed, including Rabbi [[Eliyahu de Vidas]], author of [[Reshit Chochmah]] ("Beginning of Wisdom"), and Rabbi [[Chaim Vital]], who later became the official recorder and disseminator of the teachings of Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]].

Ramak was survived by a wife whose name remains unknown (it is known that she was [[Solomon Alkabetz]]' sister) and by a son named Gedaliah (1562–1625). Gedaliah was the impetus behind the publication of some of Ramak's books in Venice, Italy c. 1584-7. Gedaliah was buried in [[Jerusalem]], where he had spent most of his adult life after returning from Venice.

==Succession of Kabbalistic interpretation after the Ramak==
According to tradition, [[Isaac Luria]] (known by the acronym "Ari" or "Arizal") arrived in Safed on the exact day of the funeral of Moshe Cordovero in 1570. When he joined in the funeral procession, he realised that only he saw a pillar of fire following the Ramak's presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/stages/stages1.htm] Article: "The Development of Kabbalah in Three Stages" Section: "The Historical Evolution of Kabbalistic Thought" from www.inner.org&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zohar]] describes this spiritual revelation as a sign to the individual who sees it, that he is meant to inherit the succession of leadership from the departed person. However, as Luria had been instructed to find his chosen disciple in Safed, [[Haim Vital]], to reveal his new teachings to, he avoided accepting Kabbalistic leadership until six months later, when Rabbi Haim Vital approached him. The Ari only lived for two years after this, until 1572, but in those few months he revolutionised the conceptual system of Kabbalah, with his new doctrines and philosophical system.

The two schools of Cordoveran and Lurianic Kabbalah give two alternative accounts and synthesis of the complete theology of Kabbalah until then, based on their interpretation of the [[Zohar]]. After the public dissemination of the Zohar in Medieval times, various attempts were made to give a complete intellectual system of theology to its different schools and interpretations. Influenced by the earlier rational success of [[Jewish philosophy]], especially the work of [[Maimonides]], in producing a systematic intellectual articulation of Judaism, the Ramak achieved the first accepted systemisation of [[Kabbalah]], based on its rational categorisation and study. Subsequent followers of the Ari saw their teachings as harmonious with, and a deeper interpretation of the Zohar and the Ramak's system, but the new system of Isaac Luria revealed completely new doctrines, as well as new descriptions of the earlier ideas of Kabbalah. In time, Lurianic Kabbalah emerged as the dominant system; however, the works of the Ramak are still highly esteemed and widely studied, as well.

==Among the Ramak's most visible books==
# "[[Pardes Rimonim]]" ("An Orchard of [[Pomegranate]]s") - Ramak's first book, an encyclopedic synthesis of the main trends of kabbalistic thought, which secured his reputation as a mystical genius.
# ''Ohr Yakar'' ("A Precious Light") - A [[Masterpiece|Magnum opus]] of some 16 volumes in its extant manuscript form, which had occupied Ramak throughout his adult life - a classic commentary on the Zohar, [[Sefer Yetzirah]] and the Zoharic literary offshoots. Its publication ended around 2005 in Jerusalem (some 22 volumes). Certain parts, such as Tefilah le-Moshe and Shiur Qomah, were previously published as separate works.&lt;ref&gt;Today, a MS. of ''Ohr Yakar'' is held at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] of New York, MS. no. 1767, copied by the Yemenite scribe [[Yihye Bashiri]] before 1630, along with other kabbalistic works.&lt;/ref&gt;
#''[[Tomer Devorah]]'' ("Palm tree [of] Deborah"), a popular work of [[Musar Literature]] based on kabbalistic principles, translated to English by Rabbi Moshe Miller (1993). First chapter translated with an extensive commentary by [[Henry Abramson]] under the title [http://jewishhistorylectures.org/the-kabbalah-of-forgiveness/ The Kabbalah of Forgiveness: The Thirteen Levels of Mercy in Rabbi Moshe Cordovero's Date Palm of Devorah (Tomer Devorah)] (2014)
# "Eilima Rabbati" - of which 2/3 is still unpublished.
# ''Ohr Neerav'' ("A Pleasant Light" - can also mean "a mixed light" and "a darkened light")- translated to English and annotated by Ira Robinson (1994).
# " Sefer Gerushin" ("The Book of Banishments") - a disclosure of Ramak's fellowship and their devotional piety in the Galilean outskirts of Safed. A highly informative text concerning RaMaK's devotional piety and the use of landscape as the negotiator between heaven and earth.

'''Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri''' ({{lang-bn|নৃসিংহপ্রসাদ ভাদুড়ী}} ''Nr̥sinha Prasād Bhāduṛi''; born 23 November 1950) is an [[Indology|Indologist]] and a specialist of Indian epics and [[Purana]]s.

Due to the difficulty and complexity of the undertaking, it took Bhaduri a decade to conceptualise the project.

== Personal life ==
Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri was born on 23 November 1950 at village Gopalpur in [[Pabna]] (now in [[Bangladesh]]). He earned a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[Sanskrit]] language from [[University of Calcutta]]. He was a reader of Sanskrit at [[Gurudas College]], Kolkata.&lt;ref name="An 'epic' task" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutt1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kartik Chandra Dutt|title=Who's who of Indian Writers: 1999 : In 2 Vol. Vol. 1 A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QA1V7sICaIwC&amp;pg=PA131|accessdate=17 December 2012|year=1999|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-0873-5|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from his job on 30 November 2010.&lt;ref name="Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri bb" /&gt;

== Literary career ==
Bhaduri is noted for his scholarly but simple interpretations of ancient Indian tales, particularly those appearing in the Indian epics, the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.&lt;ref name="Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri bb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri|url=http://asamanta.comuv.com/wp/?p=1|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He generally writes in Bengali and has written books like ''Balmikir Ram O Ramayan'', ''Arjun o Draupadi'', ''Krishna, Kunti Ebong Kaunteyo'', and others.&lt;ref name=Dutt1999 /&gt; For many years he has been writing essays on Hindu epic characters in Bengali magazines (specially ''Sarodiya'' issues of [[Bartaman]] and [[Ananda Publishers]] books like ''[[Anandamela]]'', ''[[Desh (magazine)|Desh]]'') etc. In his book ''Dandaniti'' Bhaduri has dealt with the idea of politics in ancient and mediaeval India.&lt;ref name="Chatterjee2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Partha Chatterjee|title=Lineages of Political Society: Studies in Postcolonial Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LH69yzkGZWQC&amp;pg=PA71|accessdate=26 December 2012|date=30 September 2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15813-8|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhaduri's regular column ''Katha Amrita Saman ''published in [[Sangbad Pratidin]]'s Sunday supplement issue'' Robbar ''which formerly edited by [[Rituparno Ghosh]].

[[Krishna]] has been a special interest of Bhaduri. He has written multiple books and essays on the character. In the book ''Mahabharater Bharat Yuddha Ebong Krishna'' he has discussed on the role of Krishna in [[Kurukshetra War]].&lt;ref name="Krishna in contemporary Bengali literature"&gt;{{cite web|title=Krishna in contemporary Bengali literature (Anandamela article)|year=2002|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encyclopedia project ===
{{As of|March 2012}} Bhaduri is directing a project on "Encyclopedia of Puranas" which is being sponsored by Bengali book publisher ''Sahitya Samsad'' and Netaji Subhas Institute of Asian Studies. Indian article authors said that his work was expected to challenge many long-held beliefs about the epics.&lt;ref name="Epic-pedia on a grand scale" /&gt; Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey of ''[[The Times of India]]'' said 'The encyclopaedia will challenge claims of certain Indian scholars, who under Western influences have often tried to "sanitise" the character of Krishna. In Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay's Krishnacharitra, for instance, Krishna is supposed to not have even a single consort.'&lt;ref name="Epic-pedia on a grand scale" /&gt; Jaideep Mazumdar of ''The Times of India'' said "the encyclopaedia will shatter the colonial hangover that a lot of the research into our ancient scriptures in recent times have suffered from and will present many historical figures in a new light."&lt;ref name="An 'epic' task"/&gt;

Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri was quoted in an interview as saying–&lt;ref name="An 'epic' task" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I thought it would be a good idea since all the smaller encyclopedias I came across on the Puranas were incomplete and didn't have proper reference labels. I started poring through the Puranas and making card entries. After sometime, I thought I should include the Mahabharata also since the stories in the Mahabharata have a parampara (continuity and tradition) with the Puranas. For instance, names of some kings, conventions and rituals for marriages, childbirth and funerals that are found in the Vedas find mention in the Mahabharata as well. And gaps in the Mahabharata's stories, I discovered, can be filled from the Puranas and the Vedas. And since the story of Ramayana is found in a gist in the Mahabharata, I finally decided that a complete encyclopaedia of the epics and the Puranas is necessary since all these texts and scriptures complement each other.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though the project was planned long ago, it started in 2010. According to a report published in ''The Times of India'' in August 2012, Debojyoti Dutta, chief of the publication requested Bhaduri to lead the project. Firstly, they planned to make the encyclopaedia on the ''Mahabharata'' only, but found it was too difficult to cover only one of the epics. For example, the Hindu epic character [[Krishna]] is found in a section of the ''Ramayana'' too.&lt;ref name="An 'epic' task"/&gt;

Because of the complexity and difficulty of the project it took Bhaduri one decade to work on the concept alone. Bhaduri took assistance from research scholars of [[Netaji Subhas Institute of Asian Studies]]. The team felt they could finish the project by 2013, but later Bhaduri told– "after going full steam we realised that it is going to be more difficult than we thought. I think we will go well into 2015".&lt;ref name="Epic-pedia on a grand scale" /&gt;

[[File:Japanese battleships Yamashiro, Fuso and Haruna.jpg|200px|right|Pagoda masts on the battleships ''Yamashiro'' (foreground), ''Fusō'' and ''Haruna'']]

The '''pagoda mast''' was a type of [[superstructure]] that was common on [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] [[capital ship]]s that were reconstructed during the 1930s in a bid to improve their fighting performance. These modifications were deemed to be necessary by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] as a result of the "Battleships Holiday" that was imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which strictly limited the construction of new battleships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/pre-war/1922/nav_lim.html|title=CONFERENCE ON THE LIMITATION OF ARMAMENT, 1922.|website=www.ibiblio.org|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pagoda masts were built on existing [[tripod mast]]s by adding platforms, lookouts and shelters upon each other, the end result resembling a [[pagoda]] temple. They featured a mass of platforms that included watch points, searchlights, and spotting points. The superstructures were constructed on the majority of the ships that were rebuilt by the Japanese, including the [[Kongō-class battlecruiser|''Kongō''-class battlecruiser]]s and the [[Fusō-class battleship|''Fusō'']], [[Ise-class battleship|''Ise'']], and [[Nagato-class battleship|''Nagato'']]-class [[battleship]]s. The additional platforms were supported on the ships' original tripod foremasts (a design also extensively used by the [[Royal Navy]]) and these were suitably strengthened to bear the extra weight they had to carry.

Like the British [[Royal Navy]], which was considered to be the likely enemy of Japan in the event of an armed conflict,{{cn|date=March 2016}} the Imperial Japanese Navy wanted to prepare their warships for engaging in combat during the night. Prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]], powerful searchlights were placed on the pagoda masts for the purpose of illuminating enemy ships at night. However, during the early 1940s, the searchlights mounted on the pagoda became less important as new radar technology was developed that allowed a ship to aim and shoot at targets during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/radar.htm|title=Japanese Radar Equipment in WWII|last=|first=|date=|website=www.combinedfleet.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nakajima, S.; “Japanese radar development prior to 1945,” ''IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine'', vol. 34, Dec., 1992, pp. 17-22&lt;/ref&gt;

In the navies of Europe and the Americas, tall pagoda-style masts were generally frowned upon. [[Naval architecture|Naval architects]] and sailors from the Western hemisphere claimed that the Japanese battleships were too "top-heavy" and critics often mocked these vessels by nicknaming them "[[Christmas Tree|Christmas Trees]]". Regardless of how valid these criticisms actually were, some of the pagoda masts that were built on Japanese warships during the 1930s were indeed very large. For instance, the top of the pagoda mast of the Imperial Japanese battleship [[Japanese battleship Fusō|''Fusō'']] was {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the waterline.

'''Pariṇāma-vāda''' ({{lang-sa|परिणामवाद}}), or theTransformation theory is that which pre-supposes the cause to be continually transforming itself into its effects, and it has three variations – the Satkarya-vada of the [[Samkhya]]s, the Prakrti Parinama-vada of the [[Saiva Siddhanta]] and the Brahma-Parinama-vada of the [[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] School of Thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy|author=John A.Grimes|publisher=SUNY Press|page=228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

In Indian philosophy, there are basically three major cosmological theories of origination – 1) Arambha-vada (the theory of atomic agglomeration, based on the theory of Asatkarya-vada that the effect, which is something newly produced, does not exist in the cause), 2) Parinama-vada (the theory of real transformation, based on satkarya-vada that the effect, though phenomenally different, is substantially identical with the cause, and pre-exists latently in it), and 3) [[Vivartavada]] (the theory of apparent transformation or of false appearance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Thousand Teachings: Upadesasahasari of Sankara|author=Sankaracarya|publisher=SUNY Press|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fkLggRFFBwC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qpvPUsnUO8Sq7QaCnYDADA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the fourth, [[Pratityasamutpada|Pratityasamutpada-vada]], the theory of dependent origination of [[Buddhism]].

According to the Sat-Karya-vada of the Samkhya School of [[Vedanta]], also accepted by the [[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaitavada Vedanta]], causation is the manifestation of what is in the latent condition in the cause. The Prakrti Parnama-vada is based on the premise that the world is a transformation of the primordial Nature or [[Prakrti]]. According to the Brahman Parinama-vada, the world is a transformation of [[Brahman]].
Parināma-vāda is the term that refers to the [[Monotheism|Monotheistic Schools]]’ theory of ‘actual transformation’ different from [[Vivartavada]], the [[Monism|Monistic Schools]]’ theory of apparent transformation. It is the theory that the effect is a real transformation of the cause. According to the Brahman-parinama, this universe is a real transformation of Brahman.

==Arambha-vada==

The Arambha-vada theory of causation is advocated by the [[Nyaya|Nyaya School]], which is the creationistic view of causation and implies new creation as the effect that puts an end to its antecedent nonexistence and marks a new beginning. According to this school the effect, being the counter-entity of its prior nonexistence, must be held to be nonexistent before its appearance as an effect although it arose out of a previously existent cause. This theory is the reverse of Parinama-vada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traditions of Mysticism in Bengal|author=Sadhu Santideva|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt. Ltd|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGeitIm_--cC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4aTPUvnHMYqBhAfXsoG4Aw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Arambhavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brahman as the cause==

The general Vedanta view is that Brahman is both, the Material and the Efficient, cause of the entire universe. There is nothing outside the Omnipresent Brahman. Brahman is the only being which contains the elements of cit and a-cit which are transformed into the forms of individual souls and material objects. There is no external world of souls and matter produced out of external material causes, and the very concept of [[Pradhana]] or Primal Matter, outside Brahman, involves contradiction.

==Sat-Karya-vada==

According to this philosophy, which follows from [[Satkaryavada|Sat-Karya-vada]], the cause first, potentially contains the effect in it as its [[Shakti]] (power), in an un-manifest way; then through the instrumentality of the efficient cause, that potential, latent, un-manifest effect is made actual, patent and manifest. Creation is not a new beginning but the manifestation of the already present un-manifest. The world, as the effect arisen from the pure cause, cannot be impure and imperfect because Brahman, the pure essence, merely transforms itself and does not change, and therefore, remains the same always, whereas the effects are mere names, due to words, for knowing and identifying the effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srikanth’s Philosophy of the Monotheistic Vedanta|author=Ruma Chaudhury|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|pages=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvwyXwxelxIC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prakrti]] is orderly. The [[Ṛta]] (order) that makes Prakrti appear to be composed of sub-systems arranged hierarchically with each sub-system being progressively inclusive, co-ordinating and interdependent is traditionally held to be the main basis of the doctrine of pre-existent effect or Sat-Karya-vada or the doctrine of real transformation or Parinama-vada, which R.A.Sinari states is “the earliest and epistemologically the most valuable attempt made in [[Indian Philosophy]] to set up a theory of causal order”. All phenomena, belonging to the surface and/or the deeper structure of Prakrti, are parinama i.e. transformation, of one and the same substratum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Classical Yoga|author=Georg Feuerstein|publisher=Inner Traditions|pages=30–32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWI9M9WC6MC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]] says: मायां तु प्रकृतिं – “Know Maya to be Prakrti”. But, both the Samkhya School and the [[Brahma Sutra]]s base their understandings of the process of transformation for origination of things on the will of the creator. Badarayana by stating – नासतोऽदृष्टत्वात् | (Brahma Sutra 2.2.26), declares that Existence does not come out of non-existence. The entire creation is the result of Brahman’s will – अभिध्योपदेशाच्च | (Brahma Sutra 1.4.24), and that all transmigratory existence has no beginning - उपपद्यते चाप्युलभ्यते च | (Brahma Sutra 2.1.36).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|author=Gambhirananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=414, 294, 364|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/brahma-sutra-bhasya-of-shankaracharya-IDJ504/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantra view==

[[Tantra]] has influenced the [[Hindu]], the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and the [[Jainism|Jain]] traditions. According to the Srividya and the Saivite texts, the thirty-six tattvas covering the entire range of the un-manifest and manifest world, from the gross to the most subtle known as siva, pure illumination. Parinama-vada called Sakti parinama-vada, along with the doctrine of [[Abhasavada]] or [[Pratibimbavada]], explains the relationship between samvit or Tripura and the world; Tripura refers to the totality of the three-folds – sthula (gross), suksma (subtle) and para (transcendent), it represents. According to Abhasa-vada, samvit is like a mirror and the universe is a reflection appearing on it. But the universe cannot be outside the mirror i.e. citi or samvit. According to Parinama-vada, citi (consciousness) manifests in the form of the universe without losing its pristine nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sakti – The Power in Tantra|author=Rajmani Tigunait|publisher=Himalayan Press|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XnnFl6ZFHwC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWHPUoC7IMyThQe6woGgCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vivartavada==

[[Gaudapada]] treats creation as an imaginary event even though it seems to follow a sequential order. [[Badarayana]] also states that creation for Brahman is a mere pastime out of his spontaneity without any extraneous motive. But, Gaudapada, who was aware of the concepts of the real and apparent transformations, develops the doctrine of creation as an illusory transformation of Brahman without recourse to ‘vivarta’ terminology. The followers of Advaita School promoted by [[Adi Sankara]], to whom owing to [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] the world appears as if it is real i.e. distortion or false apprehension of the all encompassing unity of Brahman, use this term ‘vivarta’ to support the principle of the immutability of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism: The Mahayana Context of Gaudapadiya|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3ekXTZMZ_sC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4aTPUvnHMYqBhAfXsoG4Aw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vidyaranya]] reminds us – एकमेवाद्वितीयं सन्नामरूपविवर्जितम् | - that before the creation there existed the Reality, one only, without a second, and without name and form ([[Panchadasi]] 5.5), this after explaining (in verse 2.59) that with Brahman as its basis, Maya creates the various objects of the world, just as a variety of pictures are drawn on a wall by the use of different colours, in other words, “Maya makes it possible for the imagination to attribute different changes to the unchangeable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi of Sri Vidyaranya Swami|author=Swami Swahananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=59,124|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pancadasi-Swami-Vidyaranya/dp/8171205070}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is, therefore, said that “Maya resembles [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]], the source of common illusions, and described as the principle of cosmic illusion, thus differing from Prakrti of the Samkhyas which is real in the full sense of the term”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt. Ltd.|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uKXPUqz3DJSqhQedzYHYAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Both, Parnama-vada and Vivartavada, have their own critics. [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhava]] rejects [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]] on the ground that it is not possible for Brahman to transform at the loss of original nature, and there cannot exist unbridgeable gulf between Cit (Spirit) and Jada (Matter).239 A perfect being of pure intelligence and bliss cannot evolve out of itself an effect that is inert and wholly lacking in intelligence. [[Ramanuja]] accepts the material causality of Brahman which is absolutely without personal modification and which has the transforming Prakrti as its body. Vivarta concept is rejected because Brahman is not the constituent cause of Maya, therefore Brahman cannot be the constituent cause of the world through Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treasury of Mahayana Sutras|author=Garma C.C.Chanpage=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aktdBheKI-IC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x6bPUtvnJ46ihgfY1oCYDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Populaire''''' is a 2012 French romantic comedy-drama film directed by Régis Roinsard. It was co-written by Roinsard, Daniel Presley and Romain Compingt. ''Populaire'' was released in France on 28 November 2012. The film's title is taken from the name of the typewriter (Japy Populaire) used in the film. ''Populaire'' tells the story of Rose Pamphyle ([[Déborah François]]), who is trained by Louis Échard ([[Romain Duris]]) to become the fastest typist in the world through winning the 1959 international [[speed typing contest]] in New York City.

==Plot==
Set in 1958–1959, ''Populaire'' focuses on Rose Pamphyle ([[Déborah François]]), who lives with her widowed father and is destined to marry a son of the local mechanic. Rose travels out of town and applies for a secretarial job with an insurance agency run by Louis Échard ([[Romain Duris]]). Louis learns that Rose can type with extraordinary speed -- using only two fingers -- and he tells her to compete in a speed-typing competition if she wants the job. 

While Rose makes the finals, she ultimately loses her first typing competition. Louis begins training Rose to become the fastest typist in the world.  He makes a bet with his best friend, Bob Taylor -- who is married to his old sweetheart, Marie -- that Rose can win the regional competition.

Louis begins to train Rose at his home, but he sets strict rules to prevent others from knowing that Rose is staying in his boyhood bedroom. He begins to teach her to [[touch typing|type with all ten fingers]] and Louis insists she take [[piano lesson]]s (taught by Marie) to strengthen her fingers.  As she struggles to learn to type with ten fingers, Louis encourages her, colour-coding the keys on her typewriter and [[ergonomy|teaching her better posture]]. As the seasons change, she excels and Louis and Rose become close friends. 

Rose wins her second typing competition, becoming the fastest in her home region of [[Lower Normandy]]. It becomes obvious to Louis' friends that Louis and Rose are romantically interested in each other, but Louis insists that a coach mustn't distract his student. They travel together to Paris and the night before the French national competition, Louis and Rose announce their love to one another and have sex.

Competing against the current national champion, Rose makes it to the finals, but struggles under the pressure. Before her final match, Louis tells Rose that he had been lying and that he has secretly been recording that her typing speed is regularly faster than her opponent's best record.  Angered by his lie, Rose is enraged into winning. Rose is ecstatic at winning and flashes Louis a big smile from on stage. After initially being elated, Louis begins to feel inadequate for somewhat ambiguous reasons. He abandons her and their training sessions.

Rose stays in Paris and becomes a French celebrity, endorsed by a major typing firm and begins using their newest typewriter. She never forgets Louis and calls him regularly, although Louis never answers the phone. Louis tries to move on, but is generally depressed and feels inadequate. Rose begins to move on and is soon in New York at the world typing competition.

While Rose starts the world competition in New York, Louis struggles with his own feelings. He reaches out to Marie and asks why she chose Bob over him. She says she didn't: Louis chose to be second place. Louis explains that he could never give Rose the smile and happiness the she had when she won in Paris -- the same smile that he saw on Marie on her wedding day to Bob. Marie says, "I was smiling because I felt loved."

Louis realises he needs to overcome his own feelings of inadequacy and flies to New York to support Rose in the international typing competition. He arrives just before the second round of the finals ends. As the judges announce the results, Rose is behind and struggling. She runs back stage to fetch her old typewriter, and Louis confronts her and professes his love. They kiss. 

Rose goes on stage for the last round - seemingly energised by love. She races ahead in the final match. About half way in, her typewriter jams. She is too fast for the typewriter. She quickly recovers and races ahead again, winning the competition to be the World's Fastest Typist. Louis walks on stage and kisses her, ending the film on the two holding hands and the audience cheering.

==Production==
===Casting===
[[File:Déborah François at the 2009 Deauville American Film Festival-01.jpg|thumb|165px|Belgian actress [[Déborah François]] plays Rose Pamphyle.]]
Roinsard was planning to cast an unknown actress in the lead role of Rose Pamphyle, but chose Belgian actress [[Déborah François]] after she impressed him in her audition.&lt;ref name="Dehn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/10076969/Deborah-Francois-interview-for-Populaire-Acting-felt-like-a-fantasy.html|title=Déborah François interview for Populaire: 'Acting felt like a fantasy'|last=Dehn|first=Georgia|date=27 May 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After asking her father to find a typewriter for her, François practised for a week before the audition.&lt;ref name="Dehn"/&gt; She told Georgia Dehn from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', "I was so fast at the audition that everyone watching asked whether I had done it much before. Of course I didn't admit to practising. I told them, 'I'm just really motivated, I really want the part, I'm ready for competition.'"&lt;ref name="Dehn"/&gt;
François believed that she connected with Rose as soon as she finished reading the script. She loved Rose's clumsiness and thought she was a bit like herself.&lt;ref name="Dehn"/&gt; François underwent six months of professional typing coaching before filming commenced. She had to practice for up to three hours every day.&lt;ref name="Dehn"/&gt; The actress explained that as they wanted it to be real, nothing is sped up in the film and her hands are featured in every scene.&lt;ref name="Dehn"/&gt;

[[Romain Duris]] was cast as Louis Échard. Duris was initially concerned about whether the costumes and style would take over causing the film to be stuck in the past. He said he needed the film to feel live and real.&lt;ref name="Mowe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/film/chic-cheerful.20111991|title=Chic cheerful|last=Mowe|first=Richard|date=9 February 2013|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|publisher=[[Newsquest]]|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor watched several films starring [[Cary Grant]] and [[James Stewart]] as well as French classics directed by [[Marcel Carné]] and [[Claude Chabrol]] to see the differences between the provinces and Paris and the ways in which people behaved and spoke in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Mowe"/&gt;

===Costume design===
Costume designer Charlotte David created and designed many of the clothes for the film. David previously created costumes for ''[[OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies]]'', which was also set in France in the fifties.&lt;ref name="Guilbault"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwd.com/eye/design/mad-hommes-behind-the-scenes-of-populaire-6502948|title=Mad Hommes: Behind the Scenes of 'Populaire'|last=Guilbault|first=Laure|date=27 November 2012|work=[[Women's Wear Daily]]|publisher=[[Fairchild Fashion Media]]|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laure Guilbault from ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' reported that the look of ''Populaire'' was inspired by ''[[Funny Face]]'', ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' and [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films.&lt;ref name="Guilbault"/&gt; François revealed that she gave her own input for the costumes, saying "I loved being involved in the creation of costumes. I could say that these suspenders should be thinner, or this skirt should be worn with an extra petticoat, or have a bow added."&lt;ref name="Guilbault"/&gt; David thought the right lingerie was crucial to the look and pointy bras, girdles and bodices were used to underpin the silhouettes.&lt;ref name="Guilbault"/&gt; Some of the lingerie was made by Parisian corsetry house [[Cadolle]].&lt;ref name="Guilbault"/&gt;

As Rose is "a young provincial woman", she often wears pretty dresses, while Bejo's character Marie, who is married to an American man, has a casual early Sixties look.&lt;ref name="Guilbault"/&gt; David explained that she wanted Marie to be a modern woman and she found printed fabrics for her costumes at De Gilles, a fabric shop in Paris, which she used to make short pants. She then completed the look with silk knit jerseys, ballet shoes, headbands and tight cardigans.&lt;ref name="Guilbault"/&gt; Lelia Delval, the hairstylist for ''Populaire'', gave Bejo a red wig to wear, which the actress liked so much, she dyed her real hair red for her next film.&lt;ref name="Guilbault"/&gt; The men wore tailor-made suits and [[tie clip]]s. Duris' character Louis sports a vintage [[Jaeger-LeCoultre]] watch.&lt;ref name="Guilbault"/&gt;

===Music===
The musical score of the film was written by French artists Rob and Emmanuel d'Orlando. The soundtrack also uses pre-existing music tracks.&lt;ref name="McCue"/&gt; It was released on 28 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Populaire-Bande-originale-du-film/dp/B00A96TVCS|title=Populaire (Bande originale du film)|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]]|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roinsard decided to use music from three years before and after the year in which the film takes place.&lt;ref name="McCue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wearemoviegeeks.com/2013/05/populaire-trailer-debuts-conversations-with-director-regis-roinsard-actress-berenice-bejo/|title=Conversations With Director Régis Roinsard &amp; Actress Bérénice Béjo|last=McCue|first=Michelle|date=7 May 2013|publisher=We Are Movie Geeks|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When choosing the pre-existing music, Roinsard combined his love of American lounge music, light jazz and '50s composers with French songs by lesser-known artists such as Jack Ary, [[Jacqueline Boyer]] and [[Les Chaussettes Noires]], whose singer [[Eddy Mitchell]] appears in the film.&lt;ref name="McCue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mintzer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/populaire/review/388560|title=Populaire: Rome Review|last=Mintzer|first=Jordan|date=11 November 2012|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roinsard thought Rob and Emmanuel d'Orlando's score added "great emotional impact to the film."&lt;ref name="McCue"/&gt; The director was inspired by both '50s and '60s recording methods for the score, which was recorded in France.&lt;ref name="McCue"/&gt; Roinsard added "The end result is close to a musical and I'm delighted since [[Stanley Donen]] and [[Bob Fosse]] are favorites of mine."&lt;ref name="McCue"/&gt;

==Release==
''Populaire'' had its world premiere at the Sarlat Film Festival. It was then released in France on 28 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festivaldufilmdesarlat.com/Les-films|title=World Tour|publisher=Sarlat Film Festival|language=French|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Populaire'' played at the [[Glasgow Film Festival]] in February, before it was released in the UK on 31 May 2013.&lt;ref name="BBFC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mowe"/&gt; The film was released on 6 September 2013 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/populaire|title=Populaire (2013)|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''Populaire'' earned €406,295 upon its opening weekend in France. The film opened to 450 theatres and landed at number three in the French box office top ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allocine.fr/boxoffice/boxofficedetail_gen_pays=5001.html?date=2012-11-28|title=Box Office France&gt; Week of November 28, 2012|publisher=[[AlloCiné]]|language=French|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 28 May 2013, ''Populaire'' has grossed $5,315,819 worldwide.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=populaire.htm|title=Populaire|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 74% approval rating with an average rating of 6.7/10 based on 61 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "The cheerfully frothy ''Populaire'' may lack substance, but its visual appeal – and director Roinsard's confident evocation of 1950s filmmaking tropes – help carry the day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/populaire/|title=Populaire|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a score of 1–100 to individual film reviews, gave ''Populaire'' an average rating of 57 based on 25 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/populaire|title=Populaire|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jérôme Vermelin from ''Metro France'' commented "Full of charm, this first film by young director Régis Roinsard is carried by an irresistible duo of Romain Duris and Deborah François."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metronews.fr/culture/video-la-bande-annonce-de-populaire-avec-romain-duris/mlky!wtlGb64lcJ3sM/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130701234317/http://www.metronews.fr/culture/video-la-bande-annonce-de-populaire-avec-romain-duris/mlky!wtlGb64lcJ3sM/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 July 2013|title=La bande-annonce de Populaire, avec Romain Duris|last=Vermelin|first=Jérôme|date=25 November 2012|work=Metro France|publisher=[[Metro International]]|language=French|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liz Beardsworth from ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave ''Populaire'' three stars and wrote "Roinsard keeps control of a film that vacillates between frothy fun and more serious social comment and cleverly uses subplots and supporting characters (including ''The Artist's'' Bérénice Bejo) to touch on weightier themes. Quaint, but charming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=138143|title=Populaire|last=Beardsworth|first=Liz|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[IndieWire]]'s Kaleem Aftab awarded the film a B− and stated "With a great cast and sufficient laughs, ''Populaire'' could find international audiences, but it's no ''Amelie''. The orthodox script will not broaden appeal outside the dedicated romcom market and the language barrier may also be a problem for some."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/rome-film-festival-review-why-the-funny-and-familiar-populaire-panders-to-u-s-audiences|title=Why the Funny and Familiar 'Populaire' Panders to U.S. Audiences|last=Aftab|first=Kaleem|date=11 November 2012|work=[[IndieWire]]|publisher=[[SnagFilms]]|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd van Hoeij, writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', said the film is "a colorful and impeccably styled romantic comedy that manages to turn the speed-typing competitions of the 1950s into entertaining cinematic fodder."&lt;ref name="Hoeij"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/reviews/populaire-1117948804/|title=Review: "Populaire"|last=Hoeij|first=Boyd van|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[PMC (company)|Penske Media Corporation]]|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to praise the performances of Duris and François, but thought the story did not quite take any unexpected turns or reveal any deeper emotions.&lt;ref name="Hoeij"/&gt;

'''Post literacy''' or '''post literacy education''' is a concept used in [[continuing education]] and [[adult education]] programs aimed at recently [[illiterate]] or "neo-literate" adults and communities, largely in the [[developing world]]. Unlike continuing education or [[further education]], which covers secondary or vocational topics for adult learners, Post literacy programs provide skills which might otherwise be provided in [[primary education]] settings.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Alan. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED472436 Re-Thinking Adult Literacy and Post-Literacy: From an International Perspective]. The Roby Kidd Memorial Lecture.  Uppingham Press (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Post literacy education aims to solidify literacy education, provide resources and media aimed at the newly literate, and also may create systems of non-formal education to serve these communities. Projects include providing formal continuing education, providing  written materials (the [[literate environment]]) relevant to economic development to newly literate members of developing societies, and leveraging radio and other non-written media to increase access to educational material in informal settings.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40821">A '''social employee''' is a worker operating within a [[social business model]]. Following an organization's social computing guidelines, social employees use [[social media]] tools both for internal [[workflow]] and [[collaboration]] purposes and for external engagement with customers, prospects and stakeholders through a combination of [[social media marketing]], [[content marketing]], [[social marketing]], and [[social selling]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IBM Social Computing Guidelines|url = http://www.ibm.com/blogs/zz/en/guidelines.html|website = IBM|date = 2011-08-03|access-date = 2016-01-16|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social employee programs are considered to be as much about culture and engagement as they are about business processes and best practices. In addition to increased leads and sales, social employee best practices are said to improve business outcomes important to social media marketing, such as increased connections and web traffic, improved brand identification and "chatter", and better customer advocacy.

== Overview ==
The term "social employee" was first introduced to describe those exhibiting the emerging characteristics of workers operating under a social business model. The concept gained broader recognition in late 2013 with the release of ''[http://bluefocusmarketing.com/book-the-social-employee/ The Social Employee]'', co-authored by marketing consultants Cheryl Burgess and Mark Burgess.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the book, the term was used to describe the end result of efforts of organizations such as [[IBM]], [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], and [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] to restructure their organizations, using a social business model and [[social computing]] principles to address the changing needs of both the workplace and their workers.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The term is often used interchangeably with similar designations like "employee advocate" or "social employee advocate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For prominent or upper-level social advocates, the terms "social leader" and "social executive" are often respectively used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucial to the perceived value of the social employee is the concept of the [[digital footprint]]. While organizations are able to generate large bases of followers through social media, research shows that [[brand marketing]] and [[brand engagement|engagement]] efforts through these networks are not as effective as those of individual employees.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, social employee programs are designed to train, empower, and support employee engagement efforts in the hopes of authentically engaging larger communities, increasing the frequency of shares, reviews, and other forms of "earned media" and expanding the brand's presence on the web.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web

== The personal or employee brand ==
A foundational concept of the social employee is the idea of the personal or employee brand. This concept first gained popular attention in a 1997 [[Fast Company (magazine)|FastCompany]] article by business leader [[Tom Peters]] titled "The Brand Called You".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/28905/brand-called-you|title = The Brand Called You|date = August 31, 1997|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = FastCompany|publisher = |last = Peters|first = Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Peters argued that the premium placed on branding impacted workers' lives to such an extent that creating and cultivating a distinct personal brand had become a professional necessity. According to Peters, doing so built trust, loyalty, visibility, influence, and employability.

With increased adoption of social media tools by both businesses and consumers in the early 21st century, many business leaders became increasingly concerned with social engagement, both internally among employees and externally with customers and other stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jure-klepic/to-engage-or-not-engage-e_b_3998928.html|title = To Engage or Not Engage Employees in Social Media—That Is the Question|date = October 1, 2013|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = Klepic|first = Jure}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.clomedia.com/blogs/3-social-workforce/post/redefining-the-social-employee|title = Redefining the Social Employee|date = June 18, 2012|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = Chief Learning Officer|publisher = MediaTec Publishing, Inc.|last = Pontefract|first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many in the business community acknowledged the potential social tools had for improved collaboration, productivity, and brand messaging, the concern that employees would misrepresent their brand, disclose proprietary information, or otherwise damage their company's reputation or ability to conduct business persisted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/02/15/should-you-let-just-any-employee-tweet-about-your-company/eWMcp9r2LsBlS1WjBGKLiI/story.html|title = Should You Let Just Any Employee Tweet About Your Company?|date = February 15, 2015|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = The Boston Globe|publisher = |last = MIT Sloan Management Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, many began to advocate for employee branding as a solution to this problem. This helped give new meaning to the concept of [[brand ambassador]]ship, positioning everyday employees in public, and potentially high-profile, engagement roles.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.icims.com/hire-expectations-institute/article-the-advantages-of-a-social-employee-engagement-strategy|title = The Advantages of a Social Employee Engagement Strategy|date = December 2, 2015|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = iCIMS|publisher = |last = Yee|first = Angela}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this approach argued that successful employee engagement depended on training, strong [[organizational culture]], and individual empowerment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.business2community.com/branding/the-rise-of-the-employee-brand-0140637#Sr7BeGj6P7wVF3U0.97|title = The Rise of the Employee Brand|date = March 1, 2012|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = Business 2 Community|publisher = |last = Burgess|first = Cheryl}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was seen as an example of a [[Win-win game|win-win]]: The corporate brand benefits from increased transparency and authenticity, while the personal brand benefits through increased visibility and employability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZUIp0ybaec|title = The Rise of the Social Employee|date = June 12, 2014|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = YouTube|publisher = TEDx Talks|last = Burgess|first = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

=== Engaged ===
Because social employee advocacy is dependent on the perceived authenticity of the employee, [[Employee engagement|engagement]] is highly valued in social organizations. Further, data show the measurable impact of employee engagement on organizational productivity and profitability:
* Happy employees were found to be 12 percent more productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/3048751/the-future-of-work/happy-employees-are-12-more-productive-at-work|title = Why Happy Employees Are 12% More Productive|date = July 22, 2015|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = FastCompany|publisher = |last = Revesencio|first = Jonha}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In one study, engaged employees were found to be 38 percent more likely to produce at above-average rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.talentculture.com/6-eye-opening-employee-engagement-statistics/|title = 6 Eye-Opening Employee Engagement Statistics|date = July 2, 2014|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = TalentCulture|publisher = |last = Photiades|first = Melissa Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another, organizations with engaged employees had a 19 percent higher than average shareholder return, while organizations with disengaged employees experienced shareholder return that was 44 percent below average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.domo.com/blog/2013/05/employee-engagement-delivers-positive-returns/|title = Employee Engagement Delivers Positive Returns|date = May 2, 2013|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Domo|publisher = |last = Kehoe|first = Julie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Engaged companies were found to outperform disengaged companies by up to 202 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dalecarnegie.com/employee-engagement/engaged-employees-infographic/|title = Engaged Employees Infographic|date = |access-date = January 15, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = Dale Carnegie Training}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Companies with strong focus on culture were found to have an average 13.9 percent turnover rate, while those with a low focus experience were found to have a 48.4 percent turnover rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238640|title = It Really Pays to Have a Rich Company Culture [Infographic]|date = October 21, 2014|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = Entrepreneur|publisher = |last = Siu|first = Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flexible job environment and work/life balance ===
The number of professionals working [[Mobile workspace|mobile or remote]] has risen considerably since 2010. While estimates vary, one study found that number of organizations with mobile or remote employees is expected to rise from 24 percent in 2012 to 89 percent by 2020.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.citrix.com/content/dam/citrix/en_us/documents/products-solutions/workplace-of-the-future-a-global-market-research-report.pdf|title = Workplace of the Future: A Global Market Research Report|date = 2012|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = Citrix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has estimated that by 2020, 105.4 million professionals will work remotely in America, about 72.3 percent of the total workforce.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25705415|title = IDC Forecasts U.S. Mobile Worker Population to Surpass 105 Million by 2020|date = June 23, 2015|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = IDC|publisher = |last = International Data Corporation (IDC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This change has been linked to a rise in social technologies, including [[biometrics]], [[Wearable computer|wearables]], [[Near field communication|near-field communications]], and [[augmented reality]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Social employees have also put a greater emphasis on [[Work–life balance|work-life balance]], with many believing that advances in technology can directly support efforts in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/05/career-success-means-work-life-balance_n_2812707.html|title = Career Success Means Work-Life Balance, Study Finds|date = March 5, 2013|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = Brooks|first = Chad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/04/18/8-ways-to-achieve-better-work-life-balance/#2715e4857a0b5793c01d3a25|title = 8 Ways To Achieve Better Work-Life Balance|date = April 18, 2013|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Forbes|publisher = |last = Smith|first = Jacquelyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purported benefits of this shift include a more flexible workforce, reduced business costs, and greater organizational leverage in attracting and retaining top talent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Buys into the brand's story ===
In 2009, thought leader [[Simon Sinek]] presented a speech called "How Great Leaders Inspire Action" at a [[TEDx|TEDxPugetSound]] event. Sinek's central argument in this speech was, "People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en|title = How Great Leaders Inspire Action|date = September 2009|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = TED|publisher = |last = Sinek|first = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept—that the story behind a business or product offering is a more compelling sales tool than the product itself—is frequently cited in [[social media marketing]] as a way to build authentic connections with stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232069|title = There's an Art to Telling Your Brand's Story: 4 Ways to Get It Right|date = April 3, 2014|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Entrepreneur|publisher = |last = Handley|first = Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2013/09/24/how-to-write-brand-stories-that-build-emotional-connections/#1d43e79062e22b4020f862e2|title = How to Write Brand Stories that Build Emotional Connections|date = September 24, 2013|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Forbes|publisher = |last = Gunelius|first = Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have argued that for employees to share a brand's story authentically, they must be engaged in that story themselves, and as a result, many companies have made storytelling part of their culture programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahmckinney/2014/02/24/this-company-is-turning-the-power-of-storytelling-within-for-employees/#2715e4857a0b4db11bb1790b|title = This Company Is Turning The Power Of Storytelling Within (For Employees)|date = February 24, 2014|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Forbes|publisher = |last = McKinney|first = Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.convinceandconvert.com/digital-marketing/storytelling/|title = How Internal Storytelling Impacts Company Culture|date = |access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Convince&amp;Convert|publisher = |last = Klotz-Guest|first = Kathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.globoforce.com/gfblog/2014/transforming-company-culture-through-storytelling/|title = Transforming Company Culture Through Storytelling|date = March 6, 2014|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Globoforce|publisher = |last = Jacobsen|first = Darcy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of securing employee buy-in and ownership for a brand's story is commonly referred to as "branding from the inside out".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/4/21/branding_from_the_in.html|title = Branding From the Inside Out|date = April 23, 2013|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = CMO.com|publisher = Adobe|last = Burgess|first = Cheryl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://marketing.about.com/od/marketingyourbrand/a/internalbrand.htm|title = Branding From the Inside Out|date = November 25, 2014|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = About.com|publisher = |last = Lake|first = Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collaborative ===
An implicit tenet in social business is that social technologies aren't a barrier to productivity, but rather a path to increased connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://marketinginsidergroup.com/social-media/social-employees-the-future-of-marketing/|title = Are Social Employees the Future of Marketing?|date = April 2, 2013|access-date = January 20, 2016|website = Marketing Insider Group|publisher = |last = Brenner|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift in [[enterprise software]] systems like [[IBM Connections]] to incorporate social communication models, such as [[Mention (blogging)|mentions]], [[wiki]]s, and [[News aggregator|newsfeeds]], reflects the changing communication dynamics within business. With an increase in diversity and sophistication in [[collaborative software]] platforms, social organizations have sought to find new creative ways to utilize these tools and secure employee buy-in around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://hbr.org/2015/04/why-no-one-uses-the-corporate-social-network|title = Why No One Uses the Corporate Social Network|date = April 7, 2015|access-date = January 20, 2016|website = Harvard Business Review|publisher = |last = Li|first = Charlene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crowdsourcing]] has also become popular in social businesses. Examples include AT&amp;T's program The Innovation Pipeline (TIP), begun in 2009, which has generated over 28,000 ideas that have led to over 75 projects with funding exceeding $44 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://dupress.com/articles/social-business-study-mit-smr/|title = Moving Beyond Marketing: Generating Social Business Value Across the Enterprise|last = Kane|date = July 15, 2014|journal = MIT Sloan Management Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = January 21, 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM has also put considerable resources into such processes, producing its social computing guidelines through employee crowdsourcing, as well as its Connections platform through the Technology Adoption Program (TAP), a more formalized crowdsourcing initiative.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Social Employee|last = Burgess|first = Cheryl|publisher = McGraw Hill Education|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-07-181641-0|location = New York|pages = |last2 = Burgess|first2 = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular form of internal collaboration is the hack day, or [[hackathon]]. Organizations such as [[Netflix]], [[Facebook]], and [[IBM]] use hack days to pull employees out of their day-to-day work environments and encourage them to collaborate in nontraditional ways in an attempt to drive [[disruptive innovation]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Netflix Tech Blog: Netflix Hack Day - Autumn 2015|url = http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/11/netflix-hack-day-autumn-2015.html|website = techblog.netflix.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stay focused and keep hacking|url = https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/stay-focused-and-keep-hacking/10150842676418920|website = www.facebook.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social employees are often encouraged to seek external collaboration opportunities with customers and prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Collaboration Tools Can Turn Your Business Into A Social Enterprise|url = http://www.cio.com/article/2937401/social-collaboration/how-collaboration-tools-can-turn-your-business-into-a-social-enterprise.html|website = CIO|access-date = 2016-01-22|first = Paul|last = Trotter}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Procter &amp; Gamble introduced the Live Well Collaborative to connect with external stakeholders and develop products and services for the 50+ demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Procter &amp; Gamble Uses External Ideas For Internal Innovation|url = http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-procter-gamble-uses-external-ideas-for-internal-innovation/|website = MIT Sloan Management Review|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2010, [[Dell]] initiated Customer Advisory Panel (CAP) Days conferences to put customers and employees in direct contact with each other. The initial program proved very popular for the organization, with over 128 million CAP-related impressions generated on Twitter.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Social listener ===
A social listener is someone who engages in social listening, or [[social media monitoring]], for professional means. Social employees can use social media monitoring for a variety of reasons, including professional development, industry news and trends, and gauging market sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Best Social Media Monitoring of 2016 {{!}} Top Ten Reviews|url = http://social-media-monitoring-review.toptenreviews.com/|website = TopTenREVIEWS|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Listening Enables Social Business|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2014/08/26/social-listening-enables-social-business/#71445c45818a|website = Forbes|access-date = 2016-01-25|first = Daniel|last = Newman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that social listening is one of the most important components of social business, as it enables organizations to collect rich market data, make more informed strategic decisions, and respond to customer needs more authentically.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tompeters.com/blogs/toms_videos/docs/Leadership_Listening.pdf|title = Leadership: Listening|date = |access-date = January 25, 2016|website = Tom Peters|publisher = |last = Peters|first = Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Customer-centric ===
Advocates of customer-centricity in social business argue that social media has changed the dynamic from one-way brand messaging to shared interactions between brand and customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = To Build a Personal Brand With Social Media Takes Experimentation|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-cardon/to-build-a-personal-brand_b_4887210.html|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-02-12|last = Cardon|first = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand and [[customer engagement]] is seen as a means of creating more lasting connections with customers and prospects and empowering them to become brand promoters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Collaboration Can Turn Customers into Brand Promoters|url = http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6551-customer-collaboration-tips.html|website = Business News Daily|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customer-centric interactions are seen to have distinct value to brands, as research shows that prospects are far more likely to trust brand-related messaging from a friend or family member than they are from a brand.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nielsen: Global Consumers' Trust in 'Earned' Advertising Grows in Importance {{!}} Nielsen|url = http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2012/nielsen-global-consumers-trust-in-earned-advertising-grows.html|website = www.nielsen.com|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a means of building social employees, some social advocates have also called for a broader definition of customer to include the employees themselves. In the book ''The Pursuit of Social Business Excellence'', authors Vala Afshar and Brad Martin made the following argument: &lt;blockquote&gt;A social business operates with the guiding principle that each employee’s responsibility is to serve one another, and that those we serve, even internally, are our customers. To earn internal customer trust and loyalty, each employee must be dependable, available, responsive, and committed to the success of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In Pursuit of Social Business Excellence|author1=Afshar, Vala  |author2=Martin, Brad |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = Charles Pinot|year = 2012|isbn = 0985356464|location = Sonoma|pages = Kindle locations 266–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In ''The Social Employee'', authors Cheryl Burgess and Mark Burgess echo this sentiment:&lt;blockquote&gt;The social employee understands that every customer is an employee somewhere, and that every coworker is a customer in many other places as well. No one likes feeling ignored or otherwise disregarded by a brand. The rise of social media means that every employee with a Twitter profile is a de facto brand ambassador. Social employees are not only aware of this, they work to maximize its impact. By prizing authentic engagement and rich exchanges, the social employee is able to leverage virtual platforms toward real-world results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Social Employee|author1=Burgess, Cheryl  |author2=Burgess, Mark |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2013|isbn = 0071816410|location = New York|pages = 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Adaptable ===
The relatively quick proliferation and prioritization of social media in business has driven a need for organizations to be more flexible and responsive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/global/files/us__en_us__socialbusiness__epw14008usen.pdf|title = The Social Business: Advent of a New Age|date = 2011|access-date = January 25, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = IBM}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn has led to a reprioritization of employee skill sets in which adaptability, self-directed learning, and organizational sharing are highly valued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Skills Gap and the Seven Skill Sets that Employers Want: Building the Ideal New Hire|url = https://www.ced.org/blog/entry/the-skills-gap-and-the-seven-skill-sets-that-employers-want-building-the-id|website = Committee for Economic Development of The Conference Board|access-date = 2016-01-26|last = Herk|first = Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 10 Unique Soft Skills Employers Desire in New Hires|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234864|website = Entrepreneur|access-date = 2016-01-26|first = Heather R.|last = Huhman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social training programs are commonly structured around self-directed learning modules, and employees are encouraged to share knowledge resources with others to improve organizational intelligence (see "Training").&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Creating a culture of social learning {{!}} IBM Smarter Workforce Blog|url = https://www.ibm.com/blogs/smarter-workforce/2015/04/creating-a-culture-of-social-learning/|website = www.ibm.com|access-date = 2016-01-27|last = Burgess|first = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common features of social employee programs ==
According to Weber Shandwick, 47 percent of employees are either already prepared to advocate for their employers or willing to learn. Of those, 21 percent are what the study refers to as "ProActivists," or [[early adopter]]s, employees who actively use social media for professional purposes, with about half of this group already posting about their employer through social channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.webershandwick.com/uploads/news/files/employees-rising-seizing-the-opportunity-in-employee-activism.pdf|title = Employees Rising: Seizing Opportunity in Employee Activism|date = April 2, 2014|access-date = January 26, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = Weber Shandwick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pilot program ===
Many organizations begin with a social employee [[Pilot experiment|pilot program]] to determine best practices suitable to their organizational structure.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Plotting Your Course with a Social Employee Pilot Program {{!}} Social Business Spotlight Blog|url = https://www.ibm.com/blogs/social-business/2015/02/10/plotting-your-course-with-a-social-employee-pilot-program/|website = www.ibm.com|access-date = 2016-02-12|last = Burgess|first = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pilot to Deployed: Employee Advocacy is How You Scale Social|url = http://www.socialmediatoday.com/webinar/2015-03-17/pilot-deployed-employee-advocacy-how-you-scale-social|website = Social Media Today|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Program design depends in part on the size of the organization and the desired scope of social adoption. For instance, whereas [[Domo (company)|Domo]] implemented a mandatory pilot program requiring the participation of all its staff, [[Dell]] recruited approximately 200 employee participants through what was called the Social Media and Communities (SMaC) University.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Let the games begin! Welcome to the #domosocial experiment. {{!}} Domo Blog|url = https://www.domo.com/blog/2012/05/let-the-games-begin-welcome-to-the-domosocial-experiment/|website = www.domo.com|access-date = 2016-02-12|last = James|first = Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Dell Trained 9,000 on Social Media - SMaC U|url = http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/social_media_training-dell_SMaC_U-social_media_and_community_university,2-330.html|website = Tom's IT Pro|date = 2012-06-19|access-date = 2016-02-12|first = David|last = Strom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Discovery ====
A common first step in a social employee pilot program is an initial process of discovery in which organizations attempt to identify and quantify their current resources. This can include a roll call of employee early adopters, an internal audit of informal adoption of social tools and practices, or a skills test to determine current adoption rates.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://issuu.com/oksbf/docs/s_dt_en/1|title = Piloting the Future of Social Business: Branding From the Inside Out|date = June 2014|access-date = February 11, 2016|website = |publisher = Harvard Business Review Italia|last = Burgess|first = Mark|pages = 24–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when Adobe conducted an internal audit, it discovered a high rate of employee social adoption. However, because different groups were using different tools across departments, informal employee tool adoption was found to have a negative effect on productivity, creating redundancies and [[Information silo|silos]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Social computing policy ====
Many organizations will recruit employees to actively participate in designing the pilot program. A fundamental concern of social media use in business has been its potential for abuse—specifically regarding the release of confidential information, negative or off-brand messages, and security risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Should employees be allowed to use social networks at work?|url = https://www.socialmediaexplorer.com/social-media-marketing/employees-on-social-networks/|website = Social Media Explorer|access-date = 2016-02-12|language = en-US|last = Falls|first = Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, one focus in many social employee pilot programs has been to establish a set of social media guidelines. For example, IBM created an internal wiki and invited employees to help build a document laying out acceptable social engagement guidelines.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This document has since been adopted by several other organizations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Training ====
To social organizations, social employee training helps to unify employee programs and tools throughout the organization and establishes a common knowledge base and set of [[best practice]]s to assist employees in sharing and decision-making.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many organizations us a combination of in-person training, digital learning modules, and [[Social learning theory|social learning]] principles.

Social employee training often applies the [[70/20/10 Model|70/20/10 learning model]] as its basis. In this model, 70 percent of learning is self-directed, 20 percent is informal mentoring or coaching, and 10 percent is formal training. Applying this dynamic, many organizations work to design a "digital learning experience" in which employees can access learning modules and other subject-specific content to help them acquire new skills.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.bersin.com/blog/post/Predictions-for-2015--Redesigning-the-Organization-for-A-Rapidly-Changing-World.aspx
| title = Predictions for 2015:  Redesigning the Organization for A Rapidly Changing World
| website = www.bersin.com
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training is often divided into mandatory basic skills modules and optional advanced skills modules. To determine what social knowledge an employee needs, a baseline or "social IQ" test is often administered.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://www.domo.com/news/media/qa-assessing-the-social-media-payoff
| title = Media - Q&amp;A: Assessing the Social Media Payoff {{!}} Domo
| website = www.domo.com
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations, such as Adobe with its Center of Excellence (CoE) and Dell with its SMaC University, have expanded their training programs to establish a more permanent resource for employees.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 4 Top Employers for Social Media Professionals|url = http://mashable.com/2010/12/14/top-companies-social-media-professionals/|website = Mashable|access-date = 2016-02-12|first = Amy-Mae|last = Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because social employee best practices affect organizational practice and culture in a broad way, upper management and executives are also encouraged to adopt social engagement best practices. Doing so is said to help drive buy-in among the workforce and reinforce organizational commitment to the program. Training for upper management and executives can often involve a process known as "reverse mentoring," in which a lower-level employee is brought in to help develop a senior-level manager's skills and basic digital literacy.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social engagement and content marketing ===
Social engagement and sharing through both internal and external channels are considered key components of social employee design. Employees are encouraged to communicate with coworkers, customers, prospects, and stakeholders through social channels by sharing industry-related news or user-generated content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://marketingland.com/5-research-based-findings-prove-content-marketing-better-native-advertising-129953
| title = 5 Research-Based Findings Show Content Marketing Beats Native Advertising
| website = Marketing Land
| language = en-US
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internally, this process is often centered on keeping employees updated on company and industry news, helping employees collaborate on projects, and building culture. Many [[Enterprise social software|enterprise-level social platforms]] have been developed to facilitate such objectives, including task management platforms, wikis, file-sharing tools, and messaging services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://hbr.org/2013/07/the-real-power-of-enterprise-s.html
| title = The Real Power of Enterprise Social Media Platforms
| website = Harvard Business Review
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Externally, the focus is often on customer engagement, often through content marketing practices. Research has shown that social sharing can have a positive impact on metrics such as brand engagement, web traffic, and sales.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The advent of digital commerce has led customers to research products more thoroughly before make a purchase decision, using social reviews, peer recommendations, and product-specific content to help guide their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://bluefocusmarketing.com/2016/02/18/do-social-reviews-really-help-your-business-socialemployee-book-review/

| last = Burgess
| first = Cheryl
| date = February 18, 2016
| website = Blue Focus Marketing
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the value of peer recommendations specifically, a primary of goal of content marketing is to encourage customers and prospects to share the content among their personal networks as a form of "earned" advocacy.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Another popular social engagement strategy with stakeholders is resharing advocate-generated content through branded channels. This is believed to strengthen relationships with stakeholders and help to humanize the brand.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== Assessment ===
Measuring the success social employee advocacy programs has presented a challenge to many organizations. While a small percentage of organizations assert that they are able to measure and validate their investment in social marketing, a larger percentage is either only qualitatively aware of the success of their social efforts or unable to measure whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.cmosurvey.org/
| title = The CMO Survey
| website = www.cmosurvey.org
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social business thought leaders argue that assessing the success of social employee programs must take into account more than financial [[return on investment]] (ROI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/social-media-roi-calculate-metrics/
| title = What’s the ROI of Your Mother?
| last = Vaynerchuck
| first = Gary
| date = December 2015
| website = GaryVaynerchuk.com
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that consider a broader set of metrics than financial return often measure success through a variety of key performance indicators:
* Number of employee profile views and connections&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* Number of leads from social channels&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* Rate at which employee network grows&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* Frequency of shares and interactions&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* Increase in online "chatter" about a brand&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* Ability to attract and retain skilled talent&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* Increases in visibility, inbound web traffic, brand recognition, and brand loyalty&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
Many organizations, however, do report financial benefits as well. Social employees are more likely to exceed their sales quota, and social businesses in general are more likely to see increased sales leads and increase in revenues.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Gamification, engagement, and culture-building programs ===
Culture-building programs vary in scope and complexity, but all use social media in some way to underscore employee, departmental, or organizational accomplishments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Program leaders will issue social engagement challenges to help employees meet goals. Challenges can include number of connections (i.e., [[Like button|likes]] or follows, [[Reblogging|retweets]]), number of leads, or frequency of posts (i.e., status updates, [[Tweets (Twitter)|tweets]], [[blog]]s, etc.).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For a more competitive element, some organizations will employ [[gamification]] strategies such as leaderboards, achievement badges, and scavenger hunts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Tajal Bewas''' (original name Taj Mohammed Samoo) ({{lang-sd|'''تاجل بيوس'''}}) was born on 22 September 1938 in [[Village]] Dargah Pir Hayat Shah, [[Taluka]] [[Sobho Dero]], [[Khairpur]], [[Sindh]]. He was a Sindhi- and Urdu-language poet, novelist, short-story writer, teacher and government official.&lt;ref name=jktb/&gt; He died on 13 December 2008 due to [[brain hemorrhage]] in [[Karachi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopediasindhiana.org/article.php?Dflt=%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%84%20%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bewas was born in Pir Hayat Shah village, Khairpur district. His received his education from local schools and the Gambat High School before completing a Master of Arts degree in Economics as an external candidate with Sindh University.{{Citation needed|date= July 2012}} After completing his education, he taught English in his home town.&lt;ref name=tntb&gt;No byline, [http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Regional/Karachi/14-Dec-2008/Tajal-Bewas-dies-at-70 "Tajal Bewas dies at 70"], article, ''The Nation'', 15 December 2008, retrieved 14 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bewas also served as a government official before his retirement, and was registrar for several companies. He was also a secretary for the Pakistani government and registrar of companies for the government of Sindh province.&lt;ref name=jktb&gt;Khaskheli, Jan, [http://www.thenews.com.pk/print1.asp? id=151776 "Tajal Bewas passes away"], ''The News'', 14 December 2008, retrieved same day.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a resident of Karachi when he died at 70. A week before his death, he had a stroke and was sent to at Liaquat National Hospital, where he died. Bewas had arranged musical programs at Chowkundi graveyard, a historical cemetery, and was buried there, as he had wanted.&lt;ref name=ntobit/&gt;

Upon his death, ''[[The Nation (Pakistani newspaper)|The Nation]]'' called Bewas "legendary"&lt;ref name=tntb/&gt; and ''The News International'' called him "renowned".&lt;ref name=jktb/&gt;

His poem, "Sindh Munhji Aman Soonh Tuhinji Mathan Chha Likhi Chha Likhan" is considered "the national anthem of Sindhis in India", according to ''[[The Regional Times of Sindh|The Regional Times]]'', which reported after his death: "He was known across Pakistan and India and many singers of both countries sung his poetry for radio and television".&lt;ref name=ntobit&gt;Turk, Niaz, [http://regionaltimes.com/14dec2008/backpagenews/sindh.htm "Renowned Sindhi poet Tajal Bewas passes away"], ''The Regional Times'', 14 December 2008, retrieved same day.&lt;/ref&gt; Bewas was the author of 44 books, 34 of them published, including ''Andaz-e-Bayan Aur'', a collection of Urdu poetry.

"He tried to experiment in all native and modern forms of poetry" and was called a Sindhi classical form "Bait", ''[[The News International]]'' of Karachi reported upon his death.&lt;ref name=jktb/&gt; Fellow [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] poet Naseer Soomro said after his death that "I always saw Tajal Bewas not only as a great poet but a generous human being too. He was aware of the techniques of the poetry and rhythms of music."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/150532-Contempt-notice-issued-to-Punjab-IG-Prisons-in-detention-case Tajal Bewas passes away,]" [[The News International]], 14 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tsoa''' or '''Tshwa''', also known as '''Kua''' and '''Hiechware''', is an [[East Kalahari Khoe]] dialect cluster spoken by several thousand people in [[Botswana]] and [[Zimbabwe]].  (This language group is not to be confused with [[Tswa language|Tswa]] (Xitswa), a Bantu language in Mozambique which has the alternate spelling Tshwa.)

One of the dialects is [[Tjwao dialect|Tjwao]] (formerly Tshwao), the only Khoisan language in Zimbabwe, where "Koisan" is a language officially recognised in the constitution.

==Dialects==
Tsoa–Kua is a [[dialect cluster]], which is still poorly studied but seems to include: 
*'''Tsoa''', also known as '''Hiechware''' and as various other combinations of Hio-, Hie-, Hai- + Chwa, Tshwa, Chuwau, Tshuwau + -re, -ri; also as Sarwa, Sesarwa (the Tswana name), Gǁabake-Ntshori, Tati, and Kwe-Etshori Kwee.  Zimbabwean Tshwao apparently belongs here.
*'''Kua''', also spelled Cua and Tyhua.  That is, both Tsoa and Kua may be pronounced something like {{IPA|[tʃwa]}}, and it's not clear that they are distinct dialects.
*'''Cire Cire''' {{IPA|[tʃire tʃire]}}, spoken in the area around Nata in Botswana.

==Phonology==
The Cire-cire (not cited) dialect has the following [[consonant]] inventory:

The clicks have a very uneven distribution: Only a dozen words begin with one of the palatal clicks ({{IPA|ǂ}}), and these are replaced by dental clicks ({{IPA|ǀ}}) among younger speakers. Only half a dozen words start with one of the alveolar clicks ({{IPA|ǃ}}), and half a dozen more with one of the affricated clicks. These rather marginal sounds are placed in parentheses in the chart.

Tsoa has the five vowels {{IPA|/a e i o u/}}. It is not clear if Tsoa has long vowels, or simply sequences of identical vowels {{IPA|/aa ee ii oo uu/}}.

There are two tones, high and low, plus a few cases of mid tone.

In the northern dialect of Kua, like all other East Kalahari Khoe languages, the palatal click series has become palatal stops.  Southern Kua has retained the palatal clicks, but the dental stops have palatalized, as they have in [[Gǀui language|Gǀui]] and [[ǂ’Amkoe language|ǂ’Amkoe]].  Thus northern Kua has {{IPA|/ɟua/}} 'ash' and {{IPA|/d̪u/}} 'eland', whereas southern Kua has {{IPA|ᶢǂua}} 'ash' and {{IPA|/d̪ʲu/}} (or perhaps {{IPA|/ɟu/}}) 'eland'.&lt;ref&gt;Gerlach, Linda (2015) "Phonetic and phonological description of the Nǃaqriaxe variety of ǂ’Amkoe and the impact of language contact".

==Description==
[[File:DeepQA.svg|350px|thumb|The high-level architecture of IBM's DeepQA used in Watson&lt;ref name="AIMagazine"/&gt;]]
Watson was created as a [[question answering]] (QA) computing system that IBM built to apply advanced [[natural language processing]], [[information retrieval]], [[knowledge representation]], [[automated reasoning]], and [[machine learning]] technologies to the field of [[open domain question answering]].&lt;ref name=ibm/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The key difference between QA technology and document search is that document search takes a keyword query and returns a list of documents, ranked in order of relevance to the query (often based on popularity and page ranking), while QA technology takes a question expressed in natural language, seeks to understand it in much greater detail, and returns a precise answer to the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://craigrhinehart.com/2011/01/17/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-technology-behind-watson/ |title=10 Things You Need to Know About the Technology Behind Watson |date=January 17, 2011 |first=Craig |last=Rhinehart |work=Entrepreneurial and Intrapreneurial Insights |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When created, IBM stated that, "more than 100 different techniques are used to analyze natural language, identify sources, find and generate hypotheses, find and score evidence, and merge and rank hypotheses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Watson, A System Designed for Answers: The Future of Workload Optimized Systems Design |url=http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&amp;subtype=WH&amp;htmlfid=POW03061USEN |work=IBM Systems and Technology |date=February 2011 |page=3 |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the Watson capabilities have been extended and the way in which Watson works has been changed to take advantage of new deployment models (Watson on IBM Cloud) and evolved machine learning capabilities and optimised hardware available to developers and researchers. It is no longer purely a [[question answering]] (QA) computing system designed from Q&amp;A pairs but can now 'see', 'hear', 'read', 'talk', 'taste', 'interpret', 'learn' and 'recommend'.

===Software===
Watson uses IBM's DeepQA software and the Apache [[UIMA]] (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) framework implementation.

===Data===
The sources of information for Watson include [[encyclopedias]], [[dictionaries]], [[thesaurus|thesauri]], [[newswire]] articles and [[literary work]]s. Watson also used databases, [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] and [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]]. Specifically, [[DBPedia]], [[WordNet]] and [[YAGO (database)|Yago]] were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The AI Behind Watson – The Technical Article |first=David |last=Ferrucci |display-authors=etal |url=http://www.aaai.org/Magazine/Watson/watson.php |journal=AI Magazine |issue=Fall 2010 |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IBM team provided Watson with millions of documents, including dictionaries, encyclopedias and other reference material that it could use to build its knowledge.&lt;ref name="nytmag"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/magazine/20Computer-t.html|title=Smarter Than You Think: What Is I.B.M.'s Watson?|last=Thompson|first=Clive|date=June 16, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|accessdate=February 18, 2011|authorlink=Clive Thompson (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

{{rquote|right|The computer's techniques for unravelling ''Jeopardy!'' clues sounded just like mine. That machine zeroes in on keywords in a clue then combs its memory (in Watson's case, a 15-terabyte databank of human knowledge) for clusters of associations with those words. It rigorously checks the top hits against all the contextual information it can muster: the category name; the kind of answer being sought; the time, place, and gender hinted at in the clue; and so on. And when it feels "sure" enough, it decides to buzz. This is all an instant, intuitive process for a human ''Jeopardy!'' player, but I felt convinced that under the hood my brain was doing more or less the same thing.|Ken Jennings&lt;ref name="threads"/&gt;}}

Watson parses questions into different keywords and sentence fragments in order to find statistically related phrases.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt; Watson's main innovation was not in the creation of a new [[algorithm]] for this operation but rather its ability to quickly execute hundreds of proven [[language analysis]] algorithms simultaneously.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414214425/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/will-watson-win-jeopardy.html |archivedate=April 14, 2011 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/will-watson-win-jeopardy.html |work=Nova ScienceNOW |title=Will Watson Win On Jeopardy!? |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more algorithms that find the same answer independently the more likely Watson is to be correct.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt; Once Watson has a small number of potential solutions, it is able to check against its database to ascertain whether the solution makes sense or not.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt;

===Comparison with human players===
[[File:Watson Jeopardy.jpg|thumb|[[Ken Jennings]], Watson, and [[Brad Rutter]] in their ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' exhibition match.]]

Watson's basic working principle is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses. This gives Watson some advantages and disadvantages compared with human ''Jeopardy!'' players.&lt;ref name=cnet /&gt; Watson has deficiencies in [[natural language understanding|understanding]] the contexts of the clues. As a result, human players usually generate responses faster than Watson, especially to short clues.&lt;ref name=nytmag /&gt; Watson's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response.&lt;ref name=nytmag /&gt; Watson has consistently better [[reaction time]] on the buzzer once it has generated a response, and is immune to human players' psychological tactics, such as jumping between categories on every clue.&lt;ref name=nytmag /&gt;&lt;ref name=jenning /&gt;

In a sequence of 20 mock games of ''Jeopardy'', human participants were able to use the average six to seven seconds that Watson needed to hear the clue and decide whether to signal for responding.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt; During that time, Watson also has to evaluate the response and determine whether it is sufficiently confident in the result to signal.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt; Part of the system used to win the ''Jeopardy!'' contest was the electronic circuitry that receives the "ready" signal and then examined whether Watson's confidence level was great enough to activate the buzzer. Given the speed of this circuitry compared to the speed of human reaction times, Watson's reaction time was faster than the human contestants except when the human anticipated (instead of reacted to) the ready signal.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibmresearchnews.blogspot.com/2010/12/how-watson-sees-hears-and-speaks-to.html |title=How Watson "sees," "hears," and "speaks" to play Jeopardy! |last=Gondek |first=David |date=January 10, 2011 |work=IBM Research News |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signaling, Watson speaks with an electronic voice and gives the responses in ''Jeopardy!''{{'s}} question format.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt; Watson's voice was synthesized from recordings that actor Jeff Woodman made for an IBM [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] program in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Avery |first=Lise |date=February 14, 2011 |title=Interview with Actor Jeff Woodman, Voice of IBM's Watson Computer |url=http://www.anythinggoesradio.com/Interviews/JeffWoodman_02_14_11.MP3 |work=Anything Goes!! |format=MP3 |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Jeopardy!'' staff used different means to notify Watson and the human players when to buzz,&lt;ref name=david /&gt; which was critical in many rounds.&lt;ref name=jenning /&gt; The humans were notified by a light, which took them tenths of a second to [[perception|perceive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/biae.clemson.edu/bpc/bp/Lab/110/reaction.htm |title=A Literature Review on Reaction Time |first=Robert J. |last=Kosinski |work=Clemson University |year=2008 |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Baker|2011|p=174}} Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds.{{sfnp|Baker|2011|p=178}} The humans tried to compensate for the perception delay by anticipating the light,&lt;ref name=strachan /&gt; but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson's response time.&lt;ref name=jenning /&gt; Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal.{{sfnp|Baker|2011|p=174}}&lt;ref name=strachan /&gt;

==History==

===Development===
Since [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]]'s victory over [[Garry Kasparov]] in chess in 1997, IBM had been on the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the restaurant they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus: [[Ken Jennings]], who was then in the middle of his successful 74-game run on ''Jeopardy!''. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive [[Paul Horn (computer scientist)|Paul Horn]] backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing ''Jeopardy!'' with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer.{{sfnp|Baker|2011|pp=6–8}} In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond.{{sfnp|Baker|2011|p=30}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |last1=Radev |first1=Dragomir R. |last2=Prager |first2=John |last3=Samn |first3=Valerie |title=Ranking potential answers to natural language questions |booktitle=Proceedings of the 6th Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing |year=2000 |url=http://clair.si.umich.edu/~radev/papers/anlp00.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |last1=Prager |first1=John |last2=Brown |first2=Eric |last3=Coden |first3=Annie |last4=Radev |first4=Dragomir R. |title=Question-answering by predictive annotation |booktitle=Proceedings, 23rd Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval |date=July 2000 |url=http://clair.si.umich.edu/~radev/papers/sigir00.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; To compete successfully on ''Jeopardy!'', Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt;

In initial tests run during 2006 by David Ferrucci, the senior manager of IBM's Semantic Analysis and Integration department, Watson was given 500 clues from past ''Jeopardy!'' programs. While the best real-life competitors buzzed in half the time and responded correctly to as many as 95% of clues, Watson's first pass could get only about 15% correct. During 2007, the IBM team was given three to five years and a staff of 15 people to solve the problems.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt; By 2008, the developers had advanced Watson such that it could compete with ''Jeopardy!'' champions.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt; By February 2010, Watson could beat human ''Jeopardy!'' contestants on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=networld&gt;{{cite web |last=Brodkin |first=Jon |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/021010-ibm-jeopardy-game.html?hpg1=bn |title=IBM's Jeopardy-playing machine can now beat human contestants |work=[[Network World]] |date=February 10, 2010 |accessdate=February 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603034018/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/021010-ibm-jeopardy-game.html?hpg1=bn |archivedate=June 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the game, Watson had access to 200 million pages of structured and unstructured content consuming four [[terabyte]]s of [[disk storage]]&lt;ref name="contentpages" /&gt; including the full text of the 2011 edition of [[Wikipedia]],&lt;ref name="atlantic20110217"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/02/is-it-time-to-welcome-our-new-computer-overlords/71388/|title=Is It Time to Welcome Our New Computer Overlords?|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Zimmer|date=February 17, 2011|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was not connected to the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/01/08/132769575/Can-A-Computer-Become-A-Jeopardy-Champ|title=Can a Computer Become a Jeopardy!

Watson consistently outperformed its human opponents on the game's signaling device, but had trouble in a few categories, notably those having short clues containing only a few words.

Although the system is primarily an IBM effort, Watson's development involved faculty and graduate students from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Information Sciences Institute]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and the [[University of Trento]],&lt;ref name="AIMagazine"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ferrucci |first=D. |url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2303/2165 |title=Building Watson: An Overview of the DeepQA Project |journal=AI Magazine |volume=31 |number=3 |year=2010 |accessdate=February 19, 2011 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as students from [[New York Medical College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Medical Students Offer Expertise to IBM's ''Jeopardy!''-Winning Computer Watson as It Pursues a New Career in Medicine |url=http://www.nymc.edu/OfficesAndServices/PublicRelations/Assets/June2012_InTouch.pdf |journal=InTouch |volume=18 |publisher=[[New York Medical College]] |date=June 2012 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preparation====
[[File:IBMWatson.jpg|thumb|250px|Watson demo at an IBM booth at a trade show]]
In 2008, IBM representatives communicated with ''Jeopardy!'' executive producer [[Harry Friedman]] about the possibility of having Watson compete against [[Ken Jennings]] and [[Brad Rutter]], two of the most successful contestants on the show, and the program's producers agreed.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Stelter |authorlink=Brian Stelter |title=I.B.M.

Human players, including former ''Jeopardy!'' contestants, also participated in mock games against Watson with Todd Alan Crain of ''[[The Onion]]'' playing host.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt; About 100 test matches were conducted with Watson winning 65% of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sostek |first=Anya |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11044/1125163-96.stm |title=Human champs of 'Jeopardy!' vs. Watson the IBM computer: a close match |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post Gazette |date=February 13, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To provide a physical presence in the televised games, Watson was represented by an "[[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]" of a globe, inspired by the IBM "smarter planet" symbol. Jennings described the computer's avatar as a "glowing blue ball criss-crossed by 'threads' of thought—42 threads, to be precise",&lt;ref name="threads"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2284721/ |title=My Puny Human Brain |last=Jennings |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Jennings |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=Newsweek Interactive Co.

A practice match was recorded on January 13, 2011, and the official matches were recorded on January 14, 2011. All participants maintained secrecy about the outcome until the match was broadcast in February.{{sfnp|Baker|2011|pp=232–258}}

====Practice match====
In a practice match before the press on January 13, 2011, Watson won a 15-question round against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter with a score of $4,400 to Jennings's $3,400 and Rutter's $1,200, though Jennings and Watson were tied before the final $1,000 question. None of the three players responded incorrectly to a clue.&lt;ref name="PracticeMatch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/ibms-watson-wins-jeopardy-practice-round-can-humans-hang/43601 |title=IBM's Watson wins Jeopardy practice round: Can humans hang? |accessdate=January 13, 2011 |last=Dignan |first=Larry |date=January 13, 2011 |work=[[ZDnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First match====
The first round was broadcast February 14, 2011, and the second round, on February 15, 2011. The right to choose the first category had been determined by a draw won by Rutter.&lt;ref name="1920sJeopardy Challenge"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The IBM Challenge Day 1 |series=Jeopardy |serieslink=Jeopardy! |airdate=February 14, 2011 |season=27 |number=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson, represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice, responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of the first category, a deliberate strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name="Strategy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibmresearchnews.blogspot.com/2011/02/knowing-what-it-knows-selected-nuances.html |title=Knowing what it knows: selected nuances of Watson's strategy |last=Lenchner |first=Jon |publisher=[[IBM]] |work=IBM Research News |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson's guess at the Daily Double location was correct. At the end of the first round, Watson was tied with Rutter at $5,000; Jennings had $2,000.&lt;ref name="1920sJeopardy Challenge" /&gt;

Watson's performance was characterized by some quirks. In one instance, Watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by Jennings. (Jennings said "What are the '20s?" in reference to the 1920s. Then Watson said "What is 1920s?") Because Watson could not recognize other contestants' responses, it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response. In another instance, Watson was initially given credit for a response of "What is a leg?" after Jennings incorrectly responded "What is: he only had one hand?" to a clue about [[George Eyser]] (the correct response was, "What is: he's missing a leg?"). Because Watson, unlike a human, could not have been responding to Jennings's mistake, it was decided that this response was incorrect.

Watson took a commanding lead in Double Jeopardy!, correctly responding to both Daily Doubles. Watson responded to the second Daily Double correctly with a 32% confidence score.&lt;ref name="Computer crushes the competition on 'Jeopardy!'"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219023019/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jwVBxDQvVKEwk_czuv8Q4jxdU1Sg?docId=2e3e918f552b4599b013b4cc473d96af |archivedate=February 19, 2011 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jwVBxDQvVKEwk_czuv8Q4jxdU1Sg?docId=2e3e918f552b4599b013b4cc473d96af |title=Computer crushes the competition on 'Jeopardy!' |work=Associated Press |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it wagered only $947 on the clue, Watson was the only contestant to miss the Final Jeopardy! response in the category U.S. CITIES ("Its [[O'Hare International Airport|largest airport]] was named for a [[Edward O'Hare|World War II hero]]; its [[Midway International Airport|second largest]], for a [[Battle of Midway|World War II battle]]").

Both Toronto and Chicago were well below Watson's confidence threshold, at 14% and 11% respectively. (This lack of confidence was the reason for the multiple question marks in Watson's response.)

The game ended with Jennings with $4,800, Rutter with $10,400, and Watson with $35,734.&lt;ref name="Computer crushes the competition on 'Jeopardy!'"/&gt;

====Second match====
During the introduction, Trebek (a Canadian native) joked that he had learned Toronto was a U.S. city, and Watson's error in the first match prompted an IBM engineer to wear a [[Toronto Blue Jays]] jacket to the recording of the second match.&lt;ref name="Trebekintro"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220044949/http://www.vancouversun.com/business/technology/Computer%2Bcreams%2Bhuman%2BJeopardy%2Bchampions/4300293/story.html |archivedate=February 20, 2011 |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/business/technology/Computer+creams+human+Jeopardy+champions/4300293/story.html |title=Computer creams human Jeopardy! champions |last=Oberman |first=Mira |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Vancouver Sun]] |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=February 17, 2011 |quote=But a Final Jeopardy flub prompted one IBM engineer to wear a Toronto Blue Jays jacket to the second day of taping and Trebek to joke that he'd learned Toronto was a U.S. city. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first round, Jennings was finally able to choose a Daily Double clue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/media/news/2011/02/bug-lets-humans-grab-daily-double-as-watson-triumphs-on-jeopardy.ars |title=Bug lets humans grab Daily Double as Watson triumphs on Jeopardy |last=Johnston |first=Casey |work=Ars Technica |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Watson responded to one Daily Double clue incorrectly for the first time in the Double Jeopardy!

====Final outcome====
The prizes for the competition were $1 million for first place (Watson), $300,000 for second place (Jennings), and $200,000 for third place (Rutter). As promised, IBM donated 100% of Watson's winnings to charity, with 50% of those winnings going to [[World Vision]] and 50% going to [[World Community Grid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=148 |title=World Community Grid to benefit from Jeopardy! competition |work=[[World Community Grid]] |date=February 4, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jennings and Rutter donated 50% of their winnings to their respective charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/33373.wss |title=Jeopardy!

In acknowledgment of IBM and Watson's achievements, Jennings made an additional remark in his Final Jeopardy! response: "I for one welcome our new computer [[overlord meme|overlords]]", echoing a similar [[Internet meme|memetic reference]] to the episode "[[Deep Space Homer]]" on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in which TV news presenter Kent Brockman speaks of welcoming "our new insect overlords".&lt;ref name="overlord"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12491688 |title=IBM's Watson supercomputer crowned Jeopardy king |work=BBC News |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="overlord2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17jeopardy-watson.html |title=Computer Wins on ‘Jeopardy!': Trivial, It's Not |last=Markoff |first=John |newspaper=The New York Times |location=[[Yorktown Heights, New York]] |date=February 16, 2011 |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennings later wrote an article for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', in which he stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;IBM has bragged to the media that Watson's question-answering skills are good for more than annoying Alex Trebek. The company sees a future in which fields like [[medical diagnosis]], [[business analytics]], and [[technical support|tech support]] are automated by question-answering software like Watson. Just as factory jobs were eliminated in the 20th century by new assembly-line robots, Brad and I were the first [[Knowledge worker|knowledge-industry workers]] put out of work by the new generation of 'thinking' machines. 'Quiz show contestant' may be the first job made redundant by Watson, but I'm sure it won't be the last.&lt;ref name="threads" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Philosophy====
Philosopher [[John Searle]] argues that Watson—despite impressive capabilities—cannot actually think.&lt;ref name=SearleWSJ&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703407304576154313126987674 |first=John |last=Searle |title=Watson Doesn't Know It Won on 'Jeopardy!' |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on his [[Chinese room]] [[thought experiment]], Searle claims that Watson, like other computational machines, is capable only of manipulating symbols, but has no ability to understand the meaning of those symbols; however, Searle's experiment has its [[Chinese room#Replies|detractors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lohr |first=Steve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/science/creating-artificial-intelligence-based-on-the-real-thing.html |title=Creating AI based on the real thing |date=December 5, 2011 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Match against members of the United States Congress====
On February 28, 2011, Watson played an untelevised exhibition match of ''Jeopardy!'' against members of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. In the first round, [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.]] (D-NJ, a former ''Jeopardy!'' contestant), who was challenging the computer with [[Bill Cassidy]] (R-LA, later Senator from Louisiana), led with Watson in second place. However, combining the scores between all matches, the final score was $40,300 for Watson and $30,000 for the congressional players combined.&lt;ref name="House Match"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307032033/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQVgg2q1jaW9UdEZn-5s-D2x-sEw?docId=b8984784c9d4454db01523b8d99b6d8e |archivedate=March 7, 2011 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQVgg2q1jaW9UdEZn-5s-D2x-sEw?docId=b8984784c9d4454db01523b8d99b6d8e |title=NJ congressman tops 'Jeopardy' computer Watson |work=Associated Press |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM's Christopher Padilla said of the match, "The technology behind Watson represents a major advancement in computing. In the data-intensive environment of government, this type of technology can help organizations make better decisions and improve how government helps its citizens."&lt;ref name="House Match"/&gt;

==Current and future applications==
According to IBM, "The goal is to have computers start to interact in natural human terms across a range of applications and processes, understanding the questions that humans ask and providing answers that humans can understand and justify."&lt;ref name="networld" /&gt; It has been suggested by Robert C. Weber, IBM's [[general counsel]], that Watson may be used for legal research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert C. |last=Weber |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202481662966&amp;slreturn=1&amp;hbxlogin=1 |title=Why 'Watson' matters to lawyers |work=The National Law Journal |date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also intends to use Watson in other information-intensive fields, such as telecommunications, financial services and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nay |first=Chris |url=http://asmarterplanet.com/blog/2011/09/putting-watson-to-work-interview-with-ibm-gm-of-watson-solutions-manoj-saxena.html |title=Putting Watson to work: Interview with GM of Watson Solutions Manoj Saxena |date=September 6, 2011 |work=Smarter Planet Blog |publisher=IBM |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson is based on commercially available IBM Power 750 servers that have been marketed since February 2010. IBM also intends to market the DeepQA software to large corporations, with a price in the millions of dollars, reflecting the $1 million needed to acquire a server that meets the minimum system requirement to operate Watson. IBM expects the price to decrease substantially within a decade as the technology improves.&lt;ref name="nytmag" /&gt;

Commentator Rick Merritt said that "there's another really important reason why it is strategic for IBM to be seen very broadly by the American public as a company that can tackle tough computer problems. A big slice of [IBM's profit] comes from selling to the U.S. government some of the biggest, most expensive systems in the world."&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web |first=Rick |last=Merritt |url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4213145/IBM-playing-Jeopardy-with-tax-dollars |title=IBM playing Jeopardy with tax dollars |work=EE Times |date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, it was reported that three companies were working with IBM to create apps embedded with Watson technology. Fluid is developing an app for retailers, one called "The North Face", which is designed to provide advice to online shoppers.

In November 2013, IBM announced it would make Watson's [[API]] available to software application providers, enabling them to build apps and services that are embedded in Watson's capabilities. To build out its base of partners who create applications on the Watson platform, IBM consults with a network of venture capital firms, which advise IBM on which of their portfolio companies may be a logical fit for what IBM calls the Watson Ecosystem. Thus far, roughly 800 organizations and individuals have signed up with IBM, with interest in creating applications that could use the Watson platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2013/11/14/ibm-opens-up-watson-as-a-web-service/ |title=IBM Opens Up Its Watson Cognitive Computer For Developers Everywhere |first=Bruce |last=Upbin |date=November 14, 2013 |work=Forbes |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In healthcare, Watson's natural language, hypothesis generation, and evidence-based learning capabilities are being investigated to see how Watson may contribute to [[clinical decision support system]]s and the increase in [[Artificial intelligence in healthcare]] for use by medical professionals.&lt;ref name="Watson in healthcare"&gt;{{cite web |title=Putting Watson to Work: Watson in Healthcare |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/watson_in_healthcare.shtml |work=IBM |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To aid physicians in the treatment of their patients, once a physician has posed a query to the system describing symptoms and other related factors, Watson first parses the input to identify the most important pieces of information; then mines patient data to find facts relevant to the patient's medical and hereditary history; then examines available data sources to form and test hypotheses;&lt;ref name="Watson in healthcare"/&gt; and finally provides a list of individualized, confidence-scored recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IBM Watson Helps Fight Cancer with Evidence-Based Diagnosis and Treatment Suggestions |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/pdf/MSK_Case_Study_IMC14794.pdf |work=IBM |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sources of data that Watson uses for analysis can include treatment guidelines, electronic medical record data, notes from healthcare providers, research materials, clinical studies, journal articles and patient information.&lt;ref name="Watson in healthcare"/&gt; Despite being developed and marketed as a "diagnosis and treatment advisor", Watson has never been actually involved in the medical diagnosis process, only in assisting with identifying treatment options for patients who have already been diagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IBM Watson Progress and 2013 Roadmap (Slide 7) |url=http://www.slideshare.net/manojsaxena2/ibm-watson-progress-and-roadmap-saxena |last=Saxena |first=Manoj |work=IBM |date=February 13, 2013 |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, it was announced that IBM would be partnering with [[Nuance Communications]] for a research project to develop a commercial product during the next 18 to 24 months, designed to exploit Watson's clinical decision support capabilities. Physicians at [[Columbia University]] would help to identify critical issues in the practice of medicine where the system's technology may be able to contribute, and physicians at the [[University of Maryland]] would work to identify the best way that a technology like Watson could interact with medical practitioners to provide the maximum assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2011/02/17/ibm-watson-next-steps.aspx |first=Nick |last=Wakeman |title=IBM's Watson heads to medical school |work=Washington Technology |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, IBM and [[WellPoint]] announced a partnership to utilize Watson's data crunching capability to help suggest treatment options to physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mathews |first=Anna Wilde |title=Wellpoint's New Hire: What is Watson? |date=September 12, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903532804576564600781798420 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in February 2013, IBM and WellPoint gave Watson its first commercial application, for [[utilization management]] decisions in [[lung cancer]] treatment at [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center]].&lt;ref name="wellpoint"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2013/02/08/ibms-watson-gets-its-first-piece-of-business-in-healthcare/ |title=IBM's Watson Gets Its First Piece Of Business In Healthcare |first=Bruce |last=Upbin |work=Forbes |date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM announced a partnership with [[Cleveland Clinic]] in October 2012. The company has sent Watson to the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of [[Case Western Reserve University]], where it will increase its health expertise and assist medical professionals in treating patients. The medical facility will utilize Watson's ability to store and process large quantities of information to help speed up and increase the accuracy of the treatment process. "Cleveland Clinic's collaboration with IBM is exciting because it offers us the opportunity to teach Watson to 'think' in ways that have the potential to make it a powerful tool in medicine", said C. Martin Harris, MD, chief information officer of Cleveland Clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Miliard |first=Mike |title=Watson Heads to Medical School: Cleveland Clinic, IBM Send Supercomputer to College |url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cleveland-clinic-ibm-send-watson-medical-school |work=Healthcare IT News |date=October 30, 2012 |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, IBM and [[MD Anderson Cancer Center]] began a pilot program to further the center's "mission to eradicate cancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | url = https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/42214.wss | publisher = IBM | title = MD Anderson Taps IBM Watson to Power "Moon Shots" Mission Aimed at Ending Cancer, Starting with Leukemia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2013/10/18/ibms-watson-now-tackles-clinical-trials-at-md-anderson-cancer-center/#1c2ce8d25518 | publisher = Forbes | title = IBM's Watson Now Tackles Clinical Trials At MD Anderson Cancer Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after spending $62 million, the project did not meet its goals and it has been stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | URL = https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2017/02/19/md-anderson-benches-ibm-watson-in-setback-for-artificial-intelligence-in-medicine/#3c636c173776 | title = MD Anderson Benches IBM Watson In Setback For Artificial Intelligence In Medicine | publisher = Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2013, IBM announced that oncologists at the Maine Center for Cancer Medicine and Westmed Medical Group in New York have started to test the Watson supercomputer system in an effort to recommend treatment for lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leske |first=Nikola |title=Doctors Seek Help on Cancer Treatment from IBM Supercomputer |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/02/08/ibm-watson-cancer-idINDEE9170G120130208 |date=February 9, 2013 |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 2017, IBM and Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance entered into a contract for IBM to deliver analysis to compensation payouts via its IBM Watson Explorer AI, this resulted in the loss of 34 jobs and the company said it would speed up compensation payout analysis via analysing claims and medical record and increase productivity by 30%. The company also said it would save ¥140m in running costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/japanese-company-replaces-office-workers-artificial-intelligence-ai-fukoku-mutual-life-insurance|title=Japanese company replaces office workers with artificial intelligence|last=McCurry|first=Justin|date=2017-01-05|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that IBM Watson will be carrying the knowledge-base of 1000 cancer specialists which will bring a revolution in the field of healthcare. IBM is regarded as a disruptive innovation. However the stream of oncology is still in its nascent stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2013/10/27/how-ibms-watson-will-change-the-way-we-work/#41965d7973b4|title=How IBM's Watson Will Change The Way We Work|last=Satell|first=Greg|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IBM Watson Group===
On January 9, 2014 IBM announced it was creating a business unit around Watson, led by senior vice president Michael Rhodin.&lt;ref name="IBMNews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/42869.wss |title=IBM Watson Group Unveils Cloud-Delivered Watson Services to Transform Industrial R&amp;D, Visualize Big Data Insights and Fuel Analytics Exploration |work=IBM News |date=January 9, 2014 |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM Watson Group will have headquarters in [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Silicon Alley]] and will employ 2,000 people. IBM has invested $1 billion to get the division going. Watson Group will develop three new [[Cloud computing|cloud]]-delivered services: Watson Discovery Advisor, Watson Engagement Advisor, and Watson Explorer. Watson Discovery Advisor will focus on [[research and development]] projects in [[pharmaceutical industry]], [[publishing]], and [[biotechnology]], Watson Engagement Advisor will focus on self-service applications using insights on the basis of [[natural language]] questions posed by business users, and Watson Explorer will focus on helping enterprise users uncover and share data-driven insights based on federated search more easily.&lt;ref name="IBMNews"/&gt; The company is also launching a $100 million venture fund to spur application development for "cognitive" applications. According to IBM, the cloud-delivered enterprise-ready Watson has seen its speed increase 24 times over—a 2,300 percent improvement in performance and its physical size shrank by 90 percent—from the size of a master bedroom to three stacked pizza boxes.&lt;ref name="IBMNews"/&gt; IBM CEO [[Virginia Rometty]] said she wants Watson to generate $10 billion in annual revenue within ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303754404579308981809586194 |title=IBM Set to Expand Watson's Reach |first=Spencer E. |last=Ante |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 9, 2014 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September 2017, Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of the MIT School of Engineering announced Antonio Torralba as the MIT director of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-leadership-for-mit-ibm-watson-ai-lab-antonio-torralba-0920 |title=New leadership for MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab |work=news.mit.edu |date=September 21, 2017 |accessdate=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, IBM's CEO [[Ginni Rometty]] proposed "Watson's Law," the "use of and application of business, smart cities, consumer applications and life in general."&lt;ref name="FORBESlaw"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2018/03/20/ibm-ceo-rometty-proposes-watsons-law-ai-in-everything/#cc466754d087 "IBM CEO Rometty Proposes 'Watson's Law': AI In Everything"], Adrian Bridgewater, ''Forbes'', March 20, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson is being used via IBM partner program as a [[Chatterbot#CogniToys|Chatterbot]] to provide the conversation for children's toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Takahashi |first1=Dean |title=Elemental's smart connected toy CogniToys taps IBM's Watson supercomputer for its brains |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/02/23/elementals-smart-connected-toy-cognitoys-taps-ibms-watson-supercomputer-for-its-brains/ |work=Venture Beat |accessdate=May 15, 2015 |ref=CogniToys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building codes===
In 2015, the engineering firm [[ENGEO]] created an online service via the IBM partner program named GoFetchCode. GoFetchCode applies Watson's natural language processing and question-answering capabilities to the [[International Code Council]]'s model building codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gofetchcode.com/about-us/|title=About Us   GoFetchCode|date=2015-10-21|website=GoFetchCode|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching assistant===
IBM Watson is being used for several projects relating to education, and has entered partnerships with Pearson Education, Blackboard, Sesame Workshop and Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leopold|first1=Todd|title=A professor built an AI teaching assistant for his courses — and it could shape the future of education|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/a-professor-built-an-ai-teaching-assistant-for-his-courses-and-it-could-shape-the-future-of-education-2017-3|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straumsheim|first1=Carl|title='Augmented Intelligence' for Higher Ed|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/16/blackboard-pearson-join-ibms-ecosystem-bring-watson-technology-higher-ed|website=Inside Higher Ed|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its partnership with Pearson, Watson is being made available inside electronic text books to provide natural language, one-on-one tutoring to students on the reading material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plenty|first1=Rebecca|title=Pearson Taps IBM’s Watson as a Virtual Tutor for College Students|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-25/e-learning-enters-bot-era-as-pearson-taps-ibm-s-watson-as-tutor|accessdate=26 September 2017|agency=Bloomberg|issue=October 25, 2016|publisher=Bloomberg|date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an individual using the free Watson APIs available to the public, [[Ashok Goel]], a professor at Georgia Tech, used Watson to create a virtual teaching assistant to assist students in his class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maderer|first1=Jason|title=Artificial Intelligence Course Creates AI Teaching Assistant|url=http://www.news.gatech.edu/2016/05/09/artificial-intelligence-course-creates-ai-teaching-assistant|website=Georgia Tech News|publisher=Georgia Tech News|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Goel did not reveal the nature of "Jill", which was created with the help of a few students and IBM.  Jill answered questions where it had a 97% certainty of an accurate answer, with the remainder being answered by human assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McFarlane | first1=Matt |title=Professor reveals to students that his assistant was an AI all along |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/innovation/professor-reveals-to-students-that-his-assistant-was-an-ai-all-along-20160513-gou6us.html |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research group of Sabri Pllana developed an assistant for learning parallel programming using the IBM Watson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Memeti|first1=Suejb|last2=Pllana|first2=Sabri|title=PAPA: A parallel programming assistant powered by IBM Watson cognitive computing technology|journal=Journal of Computational Science|date=January 2018|doi=10.1016/j.jocs.2018.01.001|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750317311493|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey with a number of novice parallel programmers at the Linnaeus University indicated that such assistant will be welcome by students that learn parallel programming.

===Weather forecasting===
In August 2016, IBM announced it would be using Watson for [[weather forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jancer|first1=Matt|title=IBM’s Watson Takes On Yet Another Job, as a Weather Forecaster|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/ibms-watson-takes-yet-another-job-weather-forecaster-180960264/?no-ist|accessdate=29 August 2016|publisher=Smithsonian|date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the company announced they would use Watson to analyze data from over 200,000 [[Weather Underground (weather service)|Weather Underground]] [[Weather station#Personal weather station|personal weather stations]], and data from other sources, as a part of project [[IBM Deep Thunder|Deep Thunder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booton|first1=Jennifer|title=IBM finally reveals why it bought The Weather Company|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ibm-finally-reveals-why-it-bought-the-weather-company-2016-06-15|accessdate=29 August 2016|publisher=Market Watch|date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion===

IBM Watson together with Marchesa designed a dress that changed the colour of the fabric depending on the mood of the audience. The dress lit up in different colours based on the sentiment of Tweets about the dress. Tweets were passed through a Watson tone analyzer and then sent back to a small computer inside the waist of the dress. As social media is an integral part of their business, the Marchesa team loved how Watson could incorporate that information into the glamour of the gown.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/cognitive-marchesa-dress/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax preparation===
On February 5–6, 2017, tax preparation company [[H&amp;R Block]] began nationwide use of a Watson-based program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moscaritolo|first1=Angela|title=H&amp;R Block Enlists IBM Watson to Find Tax Deductions|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/351508/h-r-block-enlists-ibm-watson-to-find-tax-deductions|accessdate=14 February 2017|publisher=PC Magazine|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1789">'''Wet-wipe markers''' or '''wet-erase markers''' are a type of writing implement, which are used primarily on overhead transparencies, tablets at restaurants, and office calendars. Other uses include writing on mirrors, chalkboards, plastics, ceramics, glass windows and other non-porous surfaces. The contents of these markers are: [[water]], [[resin]], and [[titanium dioxide]].&lt;ref name="mark"&gt;Fluorescent Marker labeling, Content:/Contenu: section, access date August 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The markers are similar to other products such as [[dry erase marker]]s, in both their uses and applications, and also in that they come in an assortment of colors. They differ, however, in their use of a quick drying liquid paste as their medium. By using a paste instead of an alcohol base, the marking is semi-permanent, and will not be wiped away by a whiteboard eraser. Additionally, the paste is less likely to cause allergic reaction than dry-erase alcohol or chalk dust.

Because of their semi-permanent nature, wet wipe markers are often used to draw a template, especially in school classrooms or on calendars (to mark the boxes). Dry erase markers can usually be applied on top of the wet wipe marker, and erased without touching the wet wipe marks.

Wet wipe markers were often used on [[overhead projector]] transparencies, as they could be stored and transported easily, unlike a traditional chalkboard. With the rise of computerized slide-shows (e.g. [[PowerPoint]]) in the classroom and office, overhead usage has reduced substantially, and with it, the wet wipe marker. Marks can then be cleaned off non-porous surfaces with a damp cloth.

&lt;!--"Zipser Germans" should be fleshed out into an article at some point--&gt;

'''Zipser German''' (German: '''Zipserisch''', '''Zipserdeutsch''', Hungarian: ''szepességi szász nyelv'' or ''cipszer nyelv'') is a Germanic [[dialect]] which developed in the Upper [[Spiš|Zips region]] of what is now [[Slovakia]] among people who settled there from central Germany beginning in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="KJS"&gt;Karl Julius Schröer, ''Die deutschen Mundarten des ungrischen Berglandes'' (1864)&lt;/ref&gt; The Lower Zips was inhabited by other Central Germans who spoke a similar dialect called "Gründlerisch" which is considered to be the same language.&lt;ref name="KJS"/&gt; Beginning in at least the 18th century, many Zipsers migrated to northern [[Romania]], including to southern [[Bukovina]],&lt;ref name="Hadb2"&gt;Oskar Hadbawnik, ''Die Zipser in der Bukowina'' (1968) discusses the Zipserfest held in Jakobeny in 1936 to commemorate 150 years since the Zipsers migrated to Jakobeny in 1786.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LBD"/&gt; where several other Germanic dialects were also spoken.&lt;ref name="Kosiul"&gt;Willi Kosiul, ''Die Bukowina und ihre Buchenlanddeutschen'', 2012, {{ISBN|3942867095}}, volume 2&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the speech of the Zipsers in Romania was heavily influenced by that of people from Upper Austria who settled among them and were ultimately assimilated into the Zipser ethnic community.&lt;ref&gt;Anton-Joseph Ilk, ''Zipser Volksgut aus dem Wassertal'' (1990): "Die Tatsache, daß es sich bei den Deutschen in Oberwischau - heute, wie gesagt, allgemein Zipser genannt - um eine Bevölkerungsgruppe handelt, die aus der Verschmelzung verschiedener Einwandererwellen hervorgegangen ist, widerspiegelt sich auch in der Mundart. Beim Wischauer Deutsch, dem 'Zipserischen', handelt es sich eigentlich um einen interessanten Apsekt von Sprachfusion: Der altzipserische Gründler Dialekt wurde in einer Zeitspanne von etwa hundert Jahren durch die Mundart der Oberösterreicher, so sogenannten 'Teitschn', beinahe ganz verdrängt; die Oberösterreicher, hingegen wurden als Volksgruppe von den Zipser Einwanderern - hauptsächlich durch Heirat - 'assimiliert'. Ihre Mundart setzte sich jedoch durch und entwickelte sich schließlich zum Idiom der Wischaudeutschen, der 'Zipser Sachsen'."&lt;br/&gt;"The fact that the Germans in Oberwischau - today, as noted, generally called Zipsers - are a group of people who developed out of an amalgamation of different waves of immigrants, is reflected also in their dialect. With Wischauer German, 'Zipser', one is dealing with an interesting aspect of language fusion: the Old Zipser Gründler dialect was over the course of a hundred years almost completely replaced by the dialect of the Upper Austrians, the so-called 'Germans'; the Upper Austrians however were 'assimilated' by the Zipser migrants, primarily through marriage. Their [Austrian] dialect established itself however, and developed ultimately to the [[:wikt:idiom|idiom]] of the Wischau Germans, the 'Zipser Saxons'."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Flucht und Vertreibung: 50 Jahre danach'' (Johannes-Künzig-Institut für Ostdeutsche Volkskunde, 1996): Herr F. aus Oberwischau im Sathmarer Gebiet, wo das ursprüngliche Altzipserische zur Jahrhundertwende durch eine bairische Mundart der Einwanderer aus Böhmen, Gmunden und Bad Ischl umgeformt worden war, ...&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the [[Second World War]], most Zipsers evacuated or were expelled to Germany, but a community of speakers remains in [[Chmeľnica|Hopgarten]]; their distinctive dialect is called "Outzäpsersch" (German: "Altzipserisch", literally "Old Zipserish").&lt;ref&gt;Somewhat confusingly, literature on the language also uses "Altzipserisch" in two other ways: to refer to the dialect of the Upper Zips as contrasted with "Gründlerisch", and to refer to the original Central German (Gründlerisch) dialect of the speakers who migrated to Romania, as contrasted with the Upper-Austrian-influenced dialect they now speak. For example, Claus Stephani in ''Zipser Mära und Kasska'' (1989) writes that the later settlers "sprachen Oberösterreichisch, die anderen eine Gründler Mundart: Altzipserisch" (spoke Upper Austrian, [while] the others [spoke] a Gründler dialect: Old Zipserish).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialectal differences==

The dialect spoken in Bukovina, Gründlerisch in origin, was characterized by the shift of original ([[Middle High German]]) /v/ to /b/ and of original /b/ to /p/.&lt;ref name="LBD"&gt;І. Я. Яцюк, ''Тернопільський національний педагогічний університет ім. Володимира Гнатюка'', ''Наукові записки. Серія “Філологічна”'', ''УДК 81’282.4:811.112.2(477)'': ''Lexikalische Besonderheiten Deutscher Dialekte in Galizien- und der Bukowina'': “Die Siedler in den ursprünglichen Bergwerksgemeinden im Südwesten der Bukowina sprachen Zipserisch und zwar Gründlerisch, wie es in der Unterzips gesprochen wurde. Dabei wurde [v] im Anlaut wie [b] ausgesprochen: Werke – berka, weh – be, Schwester – schbesta. Anlautendes [b] wurde zu [p]: Brot – prot, Brücke – prik.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hadb"&gt;Oskar Hadbawnik, ''Die Zipser in der Bukowina'' (1968): “Prof. Lang führt dazu aus: «Die Zipser sprechen noch gründlerisch, die Mundart der unteren Zips. Statt w sagen sie b und statt b sagen sie p. «Berka» heißt Werke, «Basa» heißt Wasser und «Perg» heißt Berg.»”&lt;!--(He typos it 'gründlersich'!)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The dialect of Hopgarten distinctively shifts Middle High German /l/, in all positions, to 'u'.&lt;ref name="KJS"/&gt;
