'''(''Z'')-Stilbene''' is a [[diarylethene]], that is, a [[hydrocarbon]] consisting of a cis [[ethene]] double bond substituted with a [[phenyl]] group on both carbon atoms of the double bond. The name stilbene was derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|stilbos}}, which means shining.

==Isomers==
Stilbene exists as two possible isomers known as [[(E)-Stilbene|(''E'')-stilbene]] and (''Z'')-stilbene. (''Z'')-Stilbene is [[steric effects|sterically hindered]] and less stable because the steric interactions force the aromatic rings out-of-plane and prevent [[conjugated system|conjugation]].{{Fact|date=June 2008}} (''Z'')-Stilbene has a melting point of {{convert|5|-|6|C}}, while (''E'')-stilbene melts around {{convert|125|C}}, illustrating that the two compounds are quite different.

==Uses==
* Stilbene is used in manufacture of [[dye]]s and [[optical brightener]]s, and also as a [[phosphor]] and a [[scintillator]].
* Stilbene is one of the [[gain medium]]s used in [[dye laser]]s.

==Properties==
* Stilbene will typically have the chemistry of a [[diarylethene]], a conjugated [[alkene#Reactions|alkene]].
* Stilbene can undergo [[photoisomerization]] under the influence of UV light.
* Stilbene can undergo [[stilbene photocyclization]], an [[intramolecular reaction]].
* (Z)-Stilbene can undergo [[electrocyclic reaction]]s.

==Natural Occurrence==
Many stilbene derivatives ([[stilbenoid]]s) are present naturally in plants. An example is [[resveratrol]] and its cousin, [[pterostilbene]].

[[Image:West Virginia-Kentucky Derecho.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Map of the 1991 West Virginia Derecho (courtesy of NOAA)]]The '''1991 West Virginia derecho''' was a serial [[derecho]] (storm) that started in [[Arkansas]] in the early morning hours of April 9, 1991, and made its way northeast, finally dying out over [[Pennsylvania]] late that evening.

Two people were killed and 145 were injured in the event, mainly from falling trees, flying debris, and mobile homes and trailers being overturned. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/casepages/apr91991page.htm|title=The West Virginia Derecho of 1991|website=www.spc.noaa.gov|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western and central West Virginia were affected by hail and several roads were blocked.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=High winds kill 2 in west virginia.|last=|first=|date=April 10, 1991|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the destructive damage occurred in [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], western [[Maryland]], and [[Western Pennsylvania]]. The fatalities associated with this storm occurred in [[Charleston, West Virginia]] and [[Huntington, West Virginia]] as a result of the high winds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Damage claims==
In West Virginia alone, there were 8,000 [[insurance]] damage claims for homes and businesses. Over 200,000&amp;nbsp;people lost power in the derecho. Many people experienced flickering lights and [[Voltage spike|power surges]]. This derecho was the worst [[severe weather]] event for West Virginia since the [[1974 Super Outbreak]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/casepages/apr91991page.htm The West Virginia Derecho of 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

== What is a Derecho? ==
There are [http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/derechofacts.htm several criteria] for a [[mesoscale convective system]] (MCS) to be considered a [[derecho]]. The system needs to have sustained winds of 58 mph, and stretch along a boundary at least 250 miles long. There must also be isolated wind gusts of 75 mph or greater. 

== Formation of a Derecho ==
# There needs to be sufficient convective available potential energy ([[Convective available potential energy|CAPE]]) in the atmosphere for several thunderstorm cells to form.  
# There needs to be sufficient inflow of air in the lower atmosphere, with strong [[Troposphere#Divergence and convergence|upper level divergence]] in the upper atmosphere.  
# There needs to be an elevated [[Mixed layer#Atmospheric mixed layer formation|mixed layer]] leading to a rapid decrease in temperature with height.  
# There needs to be high values of vertical [[wind shear]] (45 mph or greater) in the lowest 5 kilometers of the atmosphere. 
# The system usually has a [[bow echo]] type of shape.  
This is a rather simplified list of conditions needed to form a derecho. However, when all of these conditions occur simultaneously in the atmosphere, a derecho storm system has the ''potential'' to form.

The film's European premiere was at the 44th [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] in the [[Czech Republic]] on 11 July 2009.&lt;ref name=KVIFF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kviff.com/en/film-detail/2742-act-of-god/ |title=44th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival: Act of God |work=[[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] |accessdate=21 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926033857/http://www.kviff.com/en/film-detail/2742-act-of-god/ |archivedate=26 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In ''Act of God'' director Jennifer Baichwal questions whether being struck by [[lightning]] is a "random natural occurrence or a predestined event".&lt;ref name=Zeitgeist/&gt; The film contains seven stories in which Baichwal interviews people about their personal experiences with lightning strikes.&lt;ref name=EyeWeekly/&gt; She speaks to American novelist and screenwriter [[Paul Auster]], Canadian dramatist [[James O'Reilly (playwright)|James O'Reilly]], and [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] [[veteran]] and author [[Dannion Brinkley]]. She also interviews a [[Storm chasing|storm chaser]] in France,&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; and a group of Mexican mothers who accept the loss of their children to lightning at a religious festival as "God's will".&lt;ref name=AOL/&gt; She also investigates a [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] religious community in [[Rwanda]] (the lightning capital of the world) who worship the lightning god [[Shango]].&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; The reactions in each of Baichwal's subjects varies considerably, from an "act of God" to the "mechanics of reality".&lt;ref name=KVIFF/&gt;

Auster, the "philosophical anchor of the film",&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; relates how he saw his friend being struck by lightning a short distance from him at a summer camp. Auster, 14 years old at the time, survived the incident while his friend died. Auster said "It opened up a whole realm of speculation that I've continued to live with ever since."&lt;ref name=Zeitgeist/&gt;&lt;ref name=NOW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/guides/hotdocs/2009/hotdocs.cfm?content=169180 |title=Act of God |work=[[Now (newspaper)|NOW Magazine]] |first=Norman |last=Wilner |accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in spite of the deep effect this event had on him, Auster insists in the film that it was "nothing more than a random occurrence".&lt;ref name=AOL/&gt;

O'Reilly wrote a play called ''Act of God'' which was based on his experience with lightning. In the film O'Reilly says "I can't accept that it happened for a reason, nor can I really accept that there is no reason. The only way to carry on is to be humble, and a little bit in awe of these things you can't really understand."&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; Brinkley was also struck by lightning and described it as "dying for 28 minutes and going up to heaven and having a completely life-transforming experience."&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt;

Also present in the film is English [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[Musical improvisation|improvisational]] guitarist [[Fred Frith]]. Frith loosely ties up the stories by demonstrating that "we are electrical beings, our brains work electrically".&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; In the laboratory of his brother,&lt;ref name=Zeitgeist/&gt; [[neuroscientist]] [[Chris Frith]], Frith improvises music on his guitar while electrical impulses in his head are recorded with a [[brain scan]],&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NOW/&gt; showing that "our very thoughts are akin to tiny lightning strikes in the cerebral cortex."&lt;ref name=NationalPost/&gt; Baichwal described improvisation as "the state of being between meaning and chance" and "it was the perfect metaphor for being struck by lightning".&lt;ref name=NationalPost/&gt;

Frith provides the music for his segment of the film, while the [[Film score|score]] for the rest of the film comes from musicians [[Martin Tielli]], [[Dave Bidini]] and [[Selina Martin]].&lt;ref name=EyeWeekly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/film/feature/article/59055 |title=Act of God: Jennifer Baichwal's electrifying new documentary finds meaning in bolts out of the blue |work=[[Eye Weekly]] |first=Jason |last=Anderson |accessdate=21 August 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Jennifer Baichwal was born in [[Montreal]] where she studied for her master's degree in philosophy and theology at [[McGill University]]. Her debut feature-length film was ''Let It Come Down: The Life of Paul Bowles'' in 1998, which won her Best Biography at the 1999 [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]],&lt;ref name=KVIFF/&gt; and the 1999 [[Emmy Award#International Emmys|International Emmy]] for Best Arts Documentary.&lt;ref name=Straight&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.straight.com/article-224137/jennifer-baichwal-explores-lightning-strikes-act-god |title=Jennifer Baichwal investigates lightning strikes in Act of God |work=[[The Georgia Straight]] |first=Jessica |last=Werb |accessdate=21 August 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091004143354/http://www.straight.com/article-224137/jennifer-baichwal-explores-lightning-strikes-act-god| archivedate= 4 October 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baichwal is best known for her 2006 multiple award-winning documentary, ''[[Manufactured Landscapes]]'', which was about the Canadian artist [[Edward Burtynsky]].&lt;ref name=KVIFF/&gt;

Many of Baichwal's films are about artists and the creative process, but she has also explored philosophical and spiritual themes, for example in her award-winning documentary ''The Holier It Gets'', which records her journey to the source of the [[Ganges|Ganges River]] in India. ''Act of God'' looks at both the artistic and "metaphysical" side of life.&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt;

Instead of using the "traditional scientific approach", Baichwal tackled the issue lightning strikes from a "philosophical point of view".&lt;ref name=AOL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.aol.ca/article/jennifer-baichwals-act-of-god-accidental-enlightenment/608950/ |title=Jennifer Baichwal's Act of God: Accidental Enlightenment |work=[[AOL]] Canada Entertainment |first=Chris |last=Jancelewicz |accessdate=21 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607045358/http://entertainment.aol.ca/article/jennifer-baichwals-act-of-god-accidental-enlightenment/608950/ |archivedate=7 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said "Our main challenge was figuring out how to make a film about something that's totally ephemeral. I love unanswerable questions; questions like 'Is there such a thing as destiny', and 'what does it all mean?'"&lt;ref name=AOL/&gt; While research is done into the role of electricity in our brains, Baichwal wanted to find out the effect of electricity on the mind. She said that "Lightning is always cast in a scientific light [in film], unless it's used as a joke. We wanted stories that embodied that tension between meaning and chance."&lt;ref name=NationalPost&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nationalpost.com/arts/story.html?id=1542705 |title=Jennifer Baichwal: Weatherproof |work=[[National Post]] |first=Chris |last=Knight |accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of making ''Act of God'' came to Baichwal before she started working on her previous film, ''[[Manufactured Landscapes]]''. It was during that film's development and her travels around the world to attend its screenings at film festivals that she started doing research and conducting interviews for ''Act of God''.&lt;ref name=NationalPost/&gt; But the final inspiration to begin work on the film came from her partner [[Nicholas de Pencier]], "a weather nerd", and the writings of lightning survivor, [[Paul Auster]].&lt;ref name=AOL/&gt;

''Act of God'' took three years to make, which included several years of research and collecting stories from around the world of people "whose lives [were] changed by lightning". De Pencier was the film's [[cinematographer]] and co-producer.&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[File:Act of God, Pencier, Baichwal.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Producer Nick de Pencier and director Jennifer Baichwal introducing ''Act of God'' at the 44th [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival|KVIFF]].]]

''Act of God'' was selected as the Opening Night Gala feature at the 2009 [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]], the largest documentary film festival in North America.&lt;ref name=HotDocs-gala/&gt;

Chris Jancelewicz of ''[[AOL]] Canada Entertainment'' said the footage taken by Jennifer Baichwal's partner, Nick de Pencier is "nothing short of remarkable".&lt;ref name=AOL/&gt; "One of the amazing things about ''Act of God'' is Baichwal's ability to resist this urge to dictate what lightning, and ultimately chance, fate, and destiny mean in the bigger picture."&lt;ref name=AOL/&gt; Jancelewicz said that throughout the film Baichwal never imposes her views, and never comes to any conclusion, simply because "there is no conclusion to be found".&lt;ref name=AOL/&gt;

Susan Noakes of ''[[CBC News]]'' described the film as an "enigmatic meditation on being struck by lightning".&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2009/04/28/f-jennifer-baichwal-acto-of-god.html |title=Feel the electricity: Act of God is filmmaker Jennifer Baichwal's exploration of lightning strikes |work=[[CBC News]] |first=Susan |last=Noakes |accessdate=21 August 2009 | date=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jessica Werb at ''[[The Georgia Straight]]'' said the film was "one hell of a thesis".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13780">In [[geometry]], an '''affine plane''' is a system of points and lines that satisfy the following axioms:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1973|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any two distinct points lie on a unique line.
* Each line has at least two points.
* Given any line and any point not on that line there is a unique line which contains the point and does not meet the given line. ([[Playfair's axiom]])
* There exist three non-collinear points (points not on a single line).

In an affine plane, two lines are called ''parallel'' if they are equal or [[disjoint sets|disjoint]]. Using this definition, Playfair's axiom above can be replaced by:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hartshorne|2000|page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Given a point and a line, there is a unique line which contains the point and is parallel to the line.

Parallelism is an [[equivalence relation]] on the lines of an affine plane.

Since no concepts other than those involving the relationship between points and lines are involved in the axioms, an affine plane is an object of study belonging to [[incidence geometry]]. They are non-degenerate [[Linear space (geometry)|linear spaces]] satisfying Playfair's axiom.

The familiar [[Euclidean plane]] is an affine plane. There are many finite and infinite affine planes. As well as [[affine plane]]s over fields (and [[division ring]]s), there are also many [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s, not derived from coordinates in a division ring, satisfying these axioms. The [[Moulton plane]] is an example of one of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Moulton | first1=Forest Ray | title=A Simple Non-Desarguesian Plane Geometry | jstor=1986419 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | year=1902 | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9947 | volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=192–195 | doi=10.2307/1986419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finite affine planes==
[[File:Hesse configuration.svg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Affine plane of order 3 &lt;br&gt; 9 points, 12 lines&lt;/center&gt;]]

If the number of points in an affine plane is finite, then if one line of the plane contains {{math|''n''}} points then:
* each line contains {{math|''n''}} points,
* each point is contained in {{math|''n'' + 1}} lines,
* there are {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} points in all, and
* there is a total of {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''n''}} lines.
The number {{math|''n''}} is called the ''order'' of the affine plane.

All known finite affine planes have orders that are prime or prime power integers. The smallest affine plane (of order 2) is obtained by removing a line and the three points on that line from the [[Fano plane]]. A similar construction, starting from the projective plane of order three, produces the affine plane of order three sometimes called the [[Hesse configuration]]. An affine plane of order {{math|''n''}} exists if and only if a [[projective plane#Finite projective planes|projective plane]] of order {{math|''n''}} exists (however, the definition of order in these two cases is not the same). Thus, there is no affine plane of order 6 or order 10 since there are no projective planes of those orders. The [[Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem]] provides further limitations on the order of a projective plane, and thus, the order of an affine plane.

The {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''n''}} lines of an affine plane of order {{math|''n''}} fall into {{math|''n'' + 1}} equivalence classes of {{math|''n''}} lines apiece under the equivalence relation of parallelism. These classes are called ''parallel classes'' of lines. The lines in any parallel class form a partition the points of the affine plane. Each of the {{math|''n'' + 1}} lines that pass through a single point lies in a different parallel class.

The parallel class structure of an affine plane of order {{math|''n''}} may be used to construct a set of {{math|''n'' − 1}} [[mutually orthogonal latin square]]s. Only the incidence relations are needed for this construction.

==Relation with projective planes==
{{main|Projective plane}}

An affine plane can be obtained from any [[projective plane]] by removing a line and all the points on it, and conversely any affine plane can be used to construct a projective plane by adding a [[line at infinity]], each of whose points is that [[point at infinity]] where an equivalence class of parallel lines meets.

If the projective plane is [[Non-Desarguesian plane|non-Desarguesian]], the removal of different lines could result in non-isomorphic affine planes. For instance, there are exactly four projective planes of order nine, and seven affine planes of order nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moorhouse|2007|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one affine plane corresponding to the [[Desarguesian plane]] of order nine since the [[Collineation|collineation group]] of that projective plane acts [[Transitive (group action)|transitively]] on the lines of the plane. Each of the three non-Desarguesian planes of order nine have collineation groups having two orbits on the lines, producing two non-isomorphic affine planes of order nine, depending on which orbit the line to be removed is selected from.

==Affine translation planes==

A line {{math|''l''}} in a projective plane {{math|Π}} is a '''translation line''' if the group of elations with axis {{math|''l''}} [[Group action|acts]] [[Transitive property|transitively]] on the points of the affine plane obtained by removing {{math|''l''}} from the plane {{math|Π}}. A projective plane with a translation line is called a '''translation plane''' and the affine plane obtained by removing the translation line is called an '''affine translation plane'''. While in general it is often easier to work with projective planes, in this context the affine planes are preferred and several authors simply use the term translation plane to mean affine translation plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1973|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate view of affine translation planes can be obtained as follows: Let {{math|''V''}} be a {{math|2''n''}}-dimensional [[vector space]] over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''F''}}. A '''spread''' of {{math|''V''}} is a set {{math|''S''}} of {{math|''n''}}-dimensional subspaces of {{math|''V''}} that partition the non-zero vectors of {{math|''V''}}. The members of {{math|''S''}} are called the '''components''' of the spread and if {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are distinct components then {{math|1=''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''V''}}. Let {{math|''A''}} be the [[incidence structure]] whose points are the vectors of {{math|''V''}} and whose lines are the cosets of components, that is, sets of the form {{math|''v'' + ''U''}} where {{math|''v''}} is a vector of {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''U''}} is a component of the spread {{math|''S''}}. Then:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moorhouse|2007|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|''A''}} is an affine plane and the group of [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] {{math|''x'' → ''x'' + ''w''}} for a vector {{math|''w''}} is an automorphism group acting regularly on the points of this plane.

==Generalization: {{math|''k''}}-nets==

An incidence structure more general than a finite affine plane is a {{math|''k''}}-''net of order'' {{math|''n''}}. This consists of {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} points and {{math|''nk''}} lines such that:
* Parallelism (as defined in affine planes) is an equivalence relation on the set of lines.
* Every line has exactly {{math|''n''}} points, and every parallel class has {{math|''n''}} lines (so each parallel class of lines partitions the point set).
* There are {{math|''k''}} parallel classes of lines. Each point lies on exactly {{math|''k''}} lines, one from each parallel class.

An {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-net of order {{math|''n''}} is precisely an affine plane of order {{math|''n''}}.

A {{math|''k''}}-''net of order'' {{math|''n''}} is equivalent  to a set of {{math|''k'' − 2}} mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order {{math|''n''}}.

===Example: translation nets===

For an arbitrary field {{math|''F''}}, let {{math|Σ}} be a set of {{math|''n''}}-dimensional subspaces of the vector space {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, any two of which intersect only in {0} (called a '''partial spread'''). The members of {{math|Σ}}, and their cosets in {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, form the lines of a '''translation net''' on the points of {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. If {{math|1={{abs|Σ}} = ''k''}} this is a {{math|''k''}}-net of order {{math|{{abs|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}. Starting with an affine [[translation plane]], any subset of the parallel classes will form a translation net.

Given a translation net, it is not always possible to add parallel classes to the net to form an affine plane. However, if {{math|''F''}} is an infinite field, any partial spread {{math|Σ}} with fewer than {{math|{{abs|''F''}}}} members can be extended and the translation net can be completed to an affine translation plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moorhouse|2007|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric codes==
Given the "line/point" [[incidence matrix]] of any finite [[incidence structure]], {{math|''M''}}, and any [[Field (mathematics)|field]], {{math|''F''}} the row space of {{math|''M''}} over {{math|''F''}} is a [[linear code]] that we can denote by {{math|1=''C'' = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')}}. Another related code that contains information about the incidence structure is the '''Hull''' of {{math|''C''}} which is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmus Jr.|Key|1992|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hull}(C) = C \cap C^{\perp},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the orthogonal code to {{math|''C''}}.

Not much can be said about these codes at this level of generality, but if the incidence structure has some "regularity" the codes produced this way can be analyzed and information about the codes and the incidence structures can be gleaned from each other. When the incidence structure is a finite affine plane, the codes belong to a class of codes known as ''geometric codes''. How much information the code carries about the affine plane depends in part on the choice of field. If the [[Characteristic (field)|characteristic]] of the field does not divide the order of the plane, the code generated is the full space and does not carry any information. On the other hand,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmus Jr.|Key|1992|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* If {{math|''π''}} is an affine plane of order {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''F''}} is a field of characteristic {{math|''p''}}, where {{math|''p''}} divides {{math|''n''}}, then the minimum weight of the code {{math|1=''B'' = Hull(''C''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;(''π''))&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}} is {{math|''n''}} and all the minimum weight vectors are constant multiples of vectors whose entries are either zero or one.

Furthermore,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmus Jr.|Key|1992|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* If {{math|''π''}} is an affine plane of order {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''F''}} is a field of characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''C'' = Hull(''C''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;(''π''))&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}} and the minimum weight vectors are precisely the scalar multiples of the (incidence vectors of) lines of  {{math|''π''}}.

When {{math|1=''π'' = AG(2, ''q'')}} the geometric code generated is the {{math|''q''}}-ary [[Reed-Muller Code]].

==Affine spaces==
[[Affine space]]s can be defined in an analogous manner to the construction of affine planes from projective planes. It is also possible to provide a system of axioms for the higher-dimensional affine spaces which does not refer to the corresponding [[projective space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lenz|1961|page= 138}}, but see also {{harvnb|Cameron|1991|loc=chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2951">'''Aposymbiosis''' occurs when [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] organisms live apart from one another (for example, a [[clownfish]] living independently of a [[sea anemone]]).  Studies have shown that the lifecycles of both the [[Host (biology)|host]] and the symbiont are affected in some way, usually negative, and that for obligate symbiosis the effects can be drastic.&lt;ref name="AEDouglas1992"&gt;A. E.  Douglas, Requirement of pea aphids (''Acyrthosiphon pisum'') for their symbiotic bacteria, Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata (Historical Archive), Volume 65, Issue 2, Nov 1992, Pages 195–198&lt;/ref&gt; Aposymbiosis is distinct from [[exsymbiosis]], which occurs when organisms are recently separated from a symbiotic association. Because symbionts can be vertically transmitted from parent to offspring or horizontally transmitted from the environment, the presence of an aposymbiotic state suggests that transmission of the symbiont is horizontal.  A classical example of a symbiotic relationship with an aposymbiotic state is the Hawaiian bobtail squid ''[[Euprymna scolopes]]'' and the bioluminescent bacteria ''[[Vibrio fischeri]].'' While the nocturnal squid hunts, the bacteria emit light of similar intensity of the moon which camouflages the squid from predators. Juveniles are colonized within hours of hatching and ''Vibrio'' must outcompete other bacteria in the seawater through a system of recognition and infection. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Visick|first=Karen L.|last2=McFall-Ngai|first2=Margaret J.|date=2000-04-01|title=An Exclusive Contract: Specificity in the Vibrio fischeri-Euprymna scolopes Partnership|url=https://jb.asm.org/content/182/7/1779|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|language=en|volume=182|issue=7|pages=1779–1787|doi=10.1128/JB.182.7.1779-1787.2000|issn=0021-9193|pmid=10714980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Silicon-germanium]] (SiGe) [[thermoelectrics]] have been used for converting heat into power in [[spacecraft]] designed for deep-space [[NASA]] missions since 1976. This material is used in the [[radioisotope thermoelectric generators]] (RTGs) that power ''[[Voyager 1]]'', ''[[Voyager 2]]'', ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'', ''[[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]]'', [[Cassini (spacecraft)|''Cassini'']], and ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft. SiGe thermoelectric material converts enough radiated heat into [[electrical power]] to fully meet the power demands of each spacecraft. The properties of the material and the remaining components of the RTG contribute towards the efficiency of this thermoelectric conversion.

== Application history ==
[[File:RTG Space Exploration Timeline.png|upright|thumb|RTG Space Exploration Timeline]]
SiGe has been used as a material in RTGs since 1976. Each mission that has used RTG technology involves exploration of far-reaching regions of the solar system. The most recent mission, ''New Horizons'' (2005), was originally set for a 3-year exploration, but was extended to 17 years.

=== Multi-hundred-watt (MHW) applications ===
''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' [[spacecraft]] launched in August and September 1977 required [[MHW-RTG|multi-hundred-watt]] ([[MHW-RTG|MHW]]) RTG containing [[plutonium oxide]] fuel spheres for an operational life appropriate for exploration of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name=furlong12 /&gt; Conversion of the [[Radioactive decay|decay]] heat of the plutonium to electrical power was accomplished through 312 silicon-germanium (SiGe) thermoelectric couples. A hot junction temperature of 1273 [[Kelvin (unit)|K]] (1832 [[Fahrenheit (degree)|°F]]) with a cold junction temperature of 573 K (572&amp;nbsp;°F) compose the temperature gradient in the thermoelectric couple in the RTG.&lt;ref name=furlong12 /&gt; This mechanism provided the total electrical power to operate the spacecraft’s instruments, communications and other power demands. The RTG on ''Voyager'' will produce adequate electrical power for spacecraft operation until about the year 2020.&lt;ref name=furlong12 /&gt; Similar MHW-RTG models are also used on the two U.S. Air Force communications [[Lincoln Experimental Satellite|Lincoln Experimental Satellites 8 and 9]] (''[[Lincoln Experimental Satellite|LES-8/9]]'').&lt;ref name=fleurial10 /&gt;

=== General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) applications ===
The ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' spacecraft launched on October 18, 1989, the ''[[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]]'' on October 6, 1990, the [[Cassini (spacecraft)|''Cassini'']] on October 15, 1997 and the ''[[New Horizons]]'' on January 19, 2006. All of these spacecraft contain the [[GPHS-RTG|general purpose heat source (GPHS)]] RTG commissioned by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]].&lt;ref name=antonio11 /&gt; The GPHS-RTG employs identical heat-to-electrical conversion technology used in the [[MHW-RTG]]s from the ''Voyager'' missions, using SiGe thermocouples/unicouples and the Pu-238–fueled GPHS.&lt;ref name=furlong12 /&gt; ''New Horizons'' made its historic flyby  past [[Pluto]] and its moons on July 14, 2015 ([http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/ see JHU Applied Physics website]). The spacecraft's next destination will be a small [[Kuiper Belt]] object (KBO) known as [[2014 MU69]] that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond [[Pluto]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-new-horizons-team-selects-potential-kuiper-belt-flyby-target&lt;/ref&gt; Based on performance, data and modeling for the SiGe alloy RTGs, the GPHS-RTGs on ''Ulysses'', ''Cassini'' and ''New Horizons'' are expected to meet or exceed the remaining power performance requirements for their deep-space missions.&lt;ref name=dingwall3 /&gt;

== RTG alternative ==
Missions after 2010 requiring RTGs will instead use the [[Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator]] (MMRTG) containing [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) thermocouples and Pu-238 dioxide for spacecraft power applications.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The '''Bakhtiari Dam''' is an [[arch dam]] currently under construction on the [[Bakhtiari River]] within the [[Zagros Mountains]] on the border of [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]] and [[Khuzestan Province]]s, [[Iran]]. At a planned height of {{convert|325|m}},&lt;ref name=bakinfo/&gt; it will be the world's tallest dam once completed and withhold the second largest reservoir in Iran after the [[Karkheh Dam|Karkheh]] reservoir. The main purpose of the dam is [[hydroelectric]] power production and it will support a 1,500 MW power station. By trapping sediment, the dam is also expected to extend the life of the [[Dez Dam]] {{Convert|50|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} downstream.

==Background==
Preliminary studies for the dam began in 1996 and were carried out by Mahab Qods Consulting Engineers. The studies were carried out over a period of 33 months and in March 2000, the results were given to Iran Water &amp; Power Resources Development Co (IWPCO). In May 2005, IWPCO awarded consultation services for the project to Moshanir Consulting Engineers, Dezab Consulting Engineers, Econo-Electrowatt/Boyri and Stucky Pars Consulting Engineers.&lt;ref name=bakinfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Bakhtiari Project Information|url=http://en.iwpco.ir/Bakhtiari/default.aspx|publisher=IWPCO|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 30, 2007 the construction contract was awarded to China's [[Sinohydro Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Awarded Projects |url=http://www.farab.com/en/projects/HPrj/project_list.asp?tPk=1 |publisher=FARAB Co. |accessdate=30 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710224430/http://www.farab.com/en/projects/HPrj/project_list.asp?tPk=1 |archivedate=10 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract is worth $2 billion and was to be funded with direct investment from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran News Roundup October 6, 2010|url=http://www.irantracker.org/roundup/iran-news-roundup-october-6-2010|publisher=Iran Tracker|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China dams overseas|url=http://eprf.probeinternational.org/node/8501|publisher=Probe International|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinohydro signed the 118-month contract on March 15, 2011 and was expected to be working with Iran's Farab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SINOHYDRO Signed the Contract to Build Iran’s Bakhtiary Project|url=http://eng.sinohydro.com/en/idems/newsShow.asp?ArticleID=228&amp;ClassID=2|accessdate=8 May 2011|newspaper=Sinohydro Corporation|date=15 Mar 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Iranian government rejected Sinohydro's bid in late May 2012 and handed the project over to [[Khatam-al-Anbiya]] (KAA), which is controlled by the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iranian contractor to build world’s tallest arch dam, Chinese bid rejected |url=http://tehrantimes.com/economy-and-business/98368-iranian-contractor-to-build-worlds-tallest-arch-dam-chinese-bid-rejected |publisher=Tehran Times |accessdate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234647/http://www.tehrantimes.com/economy-and-business/98368-iranian-contractor-to-build-worlds-tallest-arch-dam-chinese-bid-rejected |archivedate=31 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The KAA commander announced on 19 December 2012 that construction of the dam had begun with access roads leading to the project site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran starts building second-tallest dam |url=http://gantdaily.com/2012/12/20/iran-starts-building-second-tallest-dam/ |accessdate=3 March 2013 |newspaper=Gant Daily |date=20 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228131244/http://gantdaily.com/2012/12/20/iran-starts-building-second-tallest-dam/ |archivedate=28 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 2013, Iranian President [[Mahmood Ahmadinejad]] attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the dam, initiating its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News: Bakhtiari, World 's Highest Dam, Kicks off in the Presence of Mahmood Ahmadinejad |url=http://en.iwpco.ir/Lists/News/DispForm.aspx?ID=159 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424093027/http://en.iwpco.ir/Lists/News/DispForm.aspx?ID=159 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 April 2014 |publisher=Iran Water and Power Resources Development Co. |accessdate=6 May 2013 |date=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
During construction, a total of six bridges will be built to support workers, vehicles and equipment in addition to various access roads. To divert the river, two tunnels, {{Convert|1151|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|1180|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length will be constructed at the dam's left abutment. They will have discharge capacities of {{Convert|2090|m3/s|cuft/s|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|1680|m3/s|cuft/s|0|abbr=on}} respectively. To divert the water, two [[roller-compacted concrete]] [[cofferdam]]s will be constructed. The upstream cofferdam will be {{Convert|51|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high and the downstream {{Convert|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Material to construct the dam including [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] will come from the actual excavation of the dam site along with three quarries in the area.&lt;ref name=bakspec/&gt;

==Design==
The Bakhtiari will be a {{Convert|325|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall and {{Convert|434|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long variable-radius arch dam. It will be {{Convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide at its crest and {{Convert|30|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide at its base while being composed of {{Convert|3100000|m3|ft3|0|abbr=on}} of concrete. The dam's [[reservoir]] will have a normal capacity of {{Convert|4845000000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on}} and an active or "useful" capacity of {{Convert|3070000000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on}}. At a normal elevation of {{Convert|830|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, the reservoir will have a surface area of {{Convert|58.7|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, maximum width of {{Convert|1|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and length of {{Convert|59|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Its [[drainage basin|catchment area]] will be {{Convert|6288|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=bakspec&gt;{{cite web|title=Bakhtiari Technical Specifications |url=http://en.iwpco.ir/Bakhtiari/TechInfo.aspx |publisher=IWPCO |accessdate=30 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815163612/http://en.iwpco.ir/Bakhtiari/TechInfo.aspx |archivedate=15 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam will contain two [[spillway]]s. The main service spillway will be an {{Convert|11|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} diameter tunnel in the right abutment with two flood gates. The discharge capacity of this spillway will be {{Convert|5830|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on}}. The second spillway will be two radial gates on the dam's orifice with a discharge capacity of {{Convert|1510|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on}}. The dam's powerhouse will be [[underground power station|located underground]] at the left abutment. It will be {{Convert|161|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, {{Convert|64|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|24|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide; containing 6 x 250 [[megawatt|MW]] vertical [[Francis turbine]]-generators. Before reaching the power station, water will be transferred by six {{Convert|51|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long [[penstock]]s. Feeding water to the penstocks is a {{Convert|504|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long headrace tunnel with a three gate intake structure.&lt;ref name=bakspec/&gt;

[[File:Electrical bushing assortment 1954.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Assortment of small ceramic bushings for voltages from a few hundred to a few thousand volts.]]

In [[electric power]], a '''bushing''' is an [[insulator (electricity)|insulated]] device that allows an electrical conductor to pass safely through a grounded conducting barrier such as the case of a transformer or circuit breaker. Bushings are typically made from [[porcelain]], though other materials are possible.

==Explanation==
All materials carrying an [[electric charge]] generate an [[electric field]]. When an energized conductor is near a material at earth potential, it can form very high field strengths, especially where the [[field line]]s are forced to curve sharply around the earthed material. The bushing controls the shape and strength of the field and reduces the electrical stresses in the insulating material.

==Bushing condenser==
A bushing must be designed to withstand the electrical field strength produced in the insulation, when any earthed material is present. As the strength of the electrical field increases, leakage paths may develop within the insulation. If the energy of the leakage path overcomes the dielectric strength of the insulation, it may puncture the insulation and allow the electrical energy to conduct to the nearest earthed material causing burning and arcing.

A typical bushing design has a 'conductor', (usually of copper or aluminium, occasionally of other conductive materials), surrounded by insulation, except for the terminal ends.

In the case of a busbar, the conductor terminals will support the busbar in its location. In the case of a bushing, a fixing device will also be attached to the insulation to hold it in its location. Usually, the fixing point is integral or surrounds the insulation over part of the insulated surface. The insulated material between the fixing point and the conductor is the most highly stressed area.

The design of any electrical bushing must ensure that the electrical strength of the insulated material is able to withstand the penetrating 'electrical energy' passing through the conductor, via any highly stressed areas. It must also be capable of enduring, occasional and exceptional high voltage moments as well as the normal continual service withstand voltage, as it is the voltage that directs and controls the development of leakage paths and not current.

Insulated bushings can be installed either indoor, or outdoor, and the selection of insulation will be determined by the location of the installation and the electrical service duty on the bushing.

For a bushing to work successfully over many years, the insulation must remain effective both in composition and design shape and will be key factors in its survival. Bushings can therefore vary considerably in both material and design style.

==Types==

===Porcelain insulation===
The earliest bushing designs use electro porcelain for both indoor and outdoor applications. [[Porcelain]] is impervious to moisture once sealed by fired glaze and is low cost and flexible to manufacture. The main disadvantage with porcelain is that its small value of linear expansion has to be accommodated by using flexible seals and substantial metal fittings, both of which present manufacturing and operational problems.

A basic porcelain bushing is a hollow porcelain shape that fits through a hole in a wall or metal case, allowing a conductor to pass through its center, and connect at both ends to other equipment. Bushings of this type are often made of wet-process fired porcelain, which is then glazed. A semi-conducting glaze may be used to assist in equalizing the electrical potential gradient along the length of the bushing.

The inside of the porcelain bushing is often filled with oil to provide additional insulation and bushings of this construction are widely used up to 36 KV where higher partial discharges are permitted.

Where [[partial discharge]] is required to conform to IEC60137, paper and resin insulated conductors are used in conjunction with porcelain, for unheated indoor and outdoor applications.

The use of resin (polymer, polymeric, composite) insulated bushings for high voltage applications is common, although most high-voltage bushings are usually made of resin impregnated paper insulation around the conductor with porcelain or polymer weather sheds, for the outdoor end and occasionally for the indoor end.

===Paper insulation===
Another early form of insulation was paper, however, paper is hygroscopic and absorbs moisture which is detrimental and is disadvantaged by the inflexible linear designs. Cast resin technology, has dominated insulated products since the 1960s, due to its flexibility of shape and its higher dielectrical strength.

Typically, paper insulation is later impregnated either with oil (historically), or more commonly today with resin. In the case of resin, the paper is film coated with a Phenolic resin to become Synthetic Resin Bonded Paper, (SRBP) or impregnated after dry winding with epoxy resins, to become Resin Impregnated Paper or Epoxy Resin Impregnated Paper (RIP, ERIP).

SRBP insulated bushings are typically used up to voltages around 72.5 kV. However, above 12 kV, there is a need to control the external electrical field and to even out the internal energy storage which marginalises the dielectric strength of paper insulation.

To improve the performance of paper insulated bushings, metallic foils can be inserted during the winding process. These act to stabilize the generated electrical fields, homogenising the internal energy using the effect of capacitance. This feature resulted in the Condenser/Capacitor bushing.

The condenser bushing is made by inserting very fine layers of metallic foil into the paper during the winding process. The inserted conductive foils produce a capacitive effect which dissipates the electrical energy more evenly throughout the insulated paper and reduces the electric field stress between the energised conductor and any earthed material.

Condenser bushings produce electric stress fields which are significantly less potent around the fixing flange than designs without foils and, when used in conjunction with resin impregnation, produce bushings which can be used at service voltages over one million with great success.

===Resin insulation===
Since the 1965s, resin materials have been used for all types of bushing up to the highest voltages. The flexibility of using a castable form of insulation has replaced paper insulation in many product areas and dominates the existing insulated bushing market.

As with paper insulation, the control of electric stress fields remains important. Resin insulation has greater dielectric strength than paper and requires less stress control at voltages below 25 kV. However, some compact and higher rated switchgear designs, have earthed materials closer to bushings than in the past and these designs may require stress control screens in resin bushings operating as low as 12 kV Fixing points are often integral with the main resin form, and present fewer problems to earthed materials than the metal flanges used on paper bushings. However, care must be observed in resin insulated bushings designs which use internally cast screens such that the benefit of electrical stress field control is not off set by increasing partial discharge caused by the difficulties of eliminating micro voids in the resin around the screens during the casting process. The need to eliminate voids in resin becomes more sensitive as voltages increases, and it is normal to revert to resin impregnated, foiled paper insulation for bushings rated over 72.5 kV.

Bushings sometimes fail due to [[partial discharge]]. This is sometimes due to the slow and progressive degradation of the insulation over many years of energized service; however it may also be a rapid degeneration which destroys a good bushing in a matter of hours. At present, there is great interest by the electricity supply industry in monitoring the condition of high voltage bushings. However, some bushings failing early in service are due to failures to control voltage or carry out essential maintenance, while others relate to incipient failure mechanisms built in at manufacture. This view is evidenced by the minority of bushing failures worldwide.

'''Calcium fluoride''' is the [[inorganic compound]] of the elements [[calcium]] and [[fluorine]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a white insoluble solid. It occurs as the mineral [[fluorite]] (also called fluorspar), which is often deeply coloured owing to impurities.

==Chemical structure==
The compound crystallizes in a cubic motif called a fluorite structure.
[[File:Xtals combined 2 300ppi.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Unit cell of CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, known as fluorite structure, from two equivalent perspectives. The second origin is often used when visualising point defects entered on the cation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burr|first=P. A.|last2=Cooper|first2=M. W. D.|date=2017-09-15|title=Importance of elastic finite-size effects: Neutral defects in ionic compounds|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.094107|journal=Physical Review B|volume=96|issue=9|pages=094107|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.96.094107}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; centres are eight-coordinate, being centered in a "box" for eight F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; centres. Each F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; centre is coordinated to four Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; centres.&lt;ref&gt;G. L. Miessler and D. A. Tarr “Inorganic Chemistry” 3rd Ed, Pearson/Prentice Hall publisher, {{ISBN|0-13-035471-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although perfectly packed crystalline samples are colorless, the mineral is often deeply colored due to the presence of [[F-center]]s.
The same crystal structure is found in numerous ionic compounds with formula AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as [[ceria|CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[zirconia|cubic ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[uranium dioxide|UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[thorium dioxide|ThO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[plutonium dioxide|PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. A related structure is the antifluorite structure, where the anions and cations are swapped, such as [[beryllium carbide|Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C]].

==Preparation==
The mineral [[fluorite]] is abundant, widespread, and mainly of interest as a precursor to [[hydrofluoric acid|HF]]. Thus, little motivation exists for the industrial production of CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. High purity CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is produced by treating [[calcium carbonate]] with [[hydrofluoric acid]]:&lt;ref name=Aigueperse&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aigueperse|first1=Jean|last2=Mollard|first2=Paul|last3=Devilliers|first3=Didier|last4=Chemla|first4=Marius|last5=Faron|first5=Robert|last6=Romano|first6=René|last7=Cuer|first7=Jean Pierre|title=Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic|year=2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a11_307}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HF → CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Applications==
{{Main|Fluorite}}
Naturally occurring CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the principal source of [[hydrogen fluoride]], a commodity chemical used to produce a wide range of materials.
Calcium fluoride in the [[fluorite]] state is of significant commercial importance as a fluoride source.&lt;ref&gt;Aigueperse, Jean; Mollard, Paul; Devilliers, Didier; Chemla, Marius; Faron, Robert; Romano, Renée; Cuer, Jean Pierre (2005), "Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic", Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Weinheim: Wiley-VCH, p. 307, doi:10.1002/14356007.a11_307.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen fluoride is liberated from the mineral by the action of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → [[calcium sulfate|CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]](solid) + 2 HF

===Niche uses===
Calcium fluoride is used to manufacture optical components such as windows and lenses, used in thermal imaging systems, spectroscopy, [[telescope|telescopes]], and [[excimer laser]]s. It is transparent over a broad range from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) frequencies. Its low refractive index reduces the need for [[anti-reflection coating]]s. Its insolubility in water is convenient as well. Doped calcium fluoride, like natural fluorite, exhibits [[thermoluminescence]] and is used in [[thermoluminescent dosimeter]]s.

==Safety==
CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is classified as "not dangerous", although reacting it with [[sulfuric acid]] produces toxic [[hydrofluoric acid]]. With regards to inhalation, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]]-recommended concentration of fluorine-containing dusts is 2.5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in air.&lt;ref name=Aigueperse/&gt;

[[File:Blason Cire Trudon.jpg|thumb|Armorial of Cire Trudon]]
'''Cire Trudon''' is a French candlemaker and the oldest [[wax]]-producing factory worldwide. Founded in 1643, it was the provider of the royal court of [[Louis XIV]], as well as most of the great churches of [[France]].

Cire Trudon was the biggest wax-producing factory in the French Kingdom during the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1762, in his encyclopaedia ''The art of the wax producer'', engineer [[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau|Duhamel du Monceau]], praises the skills of the Trudons and gives the manufacture as an example. Such a level of quality led to King [[Louis XIV]] elevating Charles Trudon to the [[French nobility]] as Count Trudon des Ormes.

==History==

===Claude Trudon===
In 1643, a salesman named Claude Trudon arrived in Paris. He soon became the owner of a shop on [[Rue Saint-Honoré|Saint-Honoré]], which provided its customers with wax, [[candle]]s for any domestic usage as well as church candles to the neighbouring [[Saint Roch]] parish. The candles were homemade, developing and building on a specific manufacturing process. On the eve of the reign of [[Louis XIV]], M. Trudon established his first family-owned factory which was to bear his name and make the fortune of his heirs.

===Jacques Trudon===
Claude's son Jacques took over, becoming a grocer and wax producer and joined the [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] royal court in 1687 as the apothecary and distiller of Queen Marie-Thérèse.

At the time, wax was under high scrutiny. Carefully collected on the hive, it was bleached through a series of pure water baths that washed off all the impurities. Dried in the open air, the wax was whitened by sunlight. When burning, the flame lit the translucent edges generating the glowing aura of the candle.

===Jérôme Trudon===
In 1737, Jérôme Trudon, heir of the family, purchased one of the most famous wax producing factories of the times that belonged to Lord Pean de Saint Gilles. Pean de Saint Gilles was then the official wax provider to the King. Drawing from the family expertise, Hierosme devoted his skills to the development of a vast factory. Skilful and very demanding, he produced a wax of very high quality, collecting it from the best hives of the kingdom and trading directly with the producers. The wax was then treated with the utmost attention: it was washed with the purest water after being filtered with gypsum, guaranteeing the highest quality. The factory also imported the finest cotton to manufacture wicks whose combustion was clean and regular. The Trudon candles, so white and so perfect, could burn for hours without crackling; their flame neither trembled nor smoked.

Maison Trudon furnished candles to the royal court, and cathedrals and churches over France. More than one hundred people worked at the time in a very large building – now registered in the French inventory of historical monuments – in the city of [[Antony, Hauts-de-Seine]]. Its Latin motto and its blazon are engraved on a stone board of the factory building: a depiction of hives and bees bordered by the saying: ''Deo regique laborant'' ("they work for God and for the King" — they meaning the bees).

==Cire Trudon today==
Cire Trudon still keep records of recipe and tools of wax whitening: wrought iron, 17th century pans. The moulds used to form candles bearing the royal blazons still remain: "''cierge pascal pour la Chapelle du Roy à [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], Bougies de nuit pour le Roy...''" ("Easter candle church for the Royal Chapel in Versailles, night candle for the King...")

Cire Trudon supplied the [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] castle until the end of the monarchy. During his captivity, [[Louis XVI]] used the candles of his royal wax manufacturer. The blazon and the motto would be hidden under a layer of mortar to avoid the furies of the Revolution.

It is still today the candle provider of many churches, like [[Saint-Roch, Paris|Saint-Roch]] church in Paris, which has burned their candles since 1643. 
The brand was  successfully relaunched in 2006 .

The manufacturer distributes its products in France and abroad.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16087">The term '''contact resistance''' refers to the contribution to the total [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of a system which can be attributed to the contacting interfaces of [[Electrical contact|electrical leads and connections]] as opposed to the intrinsic resistance, which is an inherent property, independent of the measurement method. This effect is often described by the term Electrical Contact Resistance or ECR and may vary with time, most often decreasing, in a process known as [[Contact_resistance#Mechanisms|resistance creep]]. The idea of potential drop on the injection electrode was introduced by [[William Shockley]]&lt;ref name="Shockley_1964"/&gt; to explain the difference between the experimental results and the model of gradual channel approximation. In addition to the term ECR, "Interface resistance", "transitional resistance", or just simply "correction term" are also used. The term "parasitic resistance" has been used as a more general term, where it is usually still assumed that the contact resistance has a major contribution.

[[File:Contact resistance example.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the contact resistance estimation by the transmission line method.]]

==Experimental characterization==
Here we need to distinguish the contact resistance evaluation in two-electrode systems (e.g. diodes) and three-electrode systems (e.g. transistors).

For two electrode systems the specific contact resistivity is experimentally defined as the slope of the [[I-V curve]] at V=0:

:&lt;math&gt;r_c = \left\{ \frac{\partial V}{\partial J} \right\}_{V=0}&lt;/math&gt;

where J is the current density = current/area. The units of specific contact resistivity are typically therefore in &lt;math&gt;\Omega \cdot \text{cm}^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; stands for ohms. When the current is a linear function of the voltage, the device is said to have [[ohmic contact]]s.

The resistance of contacts can be crudely estimated by comparing the results of a [[Four-terminal sensing|four terminal measurement]] to a simple two-lead measurement made with an ohmmeter. In a two-lead experiment, the measurement current causes a potential drop across both the test leads and the contacts so that the resistance of these elements is inseparable from the resistance of the actual device, with which they are in series. In a four-point probe measurement, one pair of leads is used to inject the measurement current while a second pair of leads, in parallel with the first, is used to measure the potential drop across the device. In the four-probe case, there is no potential drop across the voltage measurement leads so the contact resistance drop is not included. The difference between resistance derived from two-lead and four-lead methods is a reasonably accurate measurement of contact resistance assuming that the leads resistance is much smaller. Specific contact resistance can be obtained by multiplying by contact area. It should also be noted that the contact resistance may vary with temperature.

[[Inductive coupling|Inductive]] and [[capacitive coupling|capacitive]] methods could be used in principle to measure an intrinsic [[electrical impedance|impedance]] without the complication of contact resistance. In practice, [[direct current]] methods are more typically used to determine resistance.

The three electrode systems such as transistors require more complicated methods for the contact resistance approximation. The most common approach is the [[transmission line measurement|transmission line model]] (TLM). Here, the total device resistance &lt;math&gt;R_\text{tot}&lt;/math&gt; is plotted as a function of the channel length:

:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{tot} = R_\text{c} + R_\text{ch} = R_\text{c} + \frac{L}{W C \mu \left(V_\text{gs} - V_\text{ds}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_\text{ch}&lt;/math&gt; are contact and channel resistances, respectively, &lt;math&gt;L/W&lt;/math&gt; is the channel length/width, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is gate insulator capacitance (per unit of area), &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is carrier mobility, and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{gs}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{ds}&lt;/math&gt; are gate-source and drain-source voltages. Therefore, the linear extrapolation of total resistance to the zero channel length provides the contact resistance. The slope of the linear function is related to the channel transconductance and can be used for estimation of the ”contact resistance-free” carrier mobility. The approximations used here (linear potential drop across the channel region, constant contact resistance,...) lead sometimes to the channel dependent contact resistance.&lt;ref name="Weis_2010"/&gt;

Beside the TLM it was proposed the gated four-probe measurement&lt;ref name="Pesavento_2004"/&gt; and the modified [[time-of-flight]] method (TOF).&lt;ref name="Weis_2009"/&gt; The direct methods able to measure potential drop on the injection electrode directly are the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KFM)&lt;ref name="Bürgi_2002"/&gt; and the electric-field induced second harmonic generation.&lt;ref name="Nakao_2009"/&gt;

==Mechanisms==
For given physical and mechanical material properties, parameters that govern the magnitude of electrical contact resistance (ECR) and its variation at an interface relate primarily to [[surface structure]] and applied load ([[Contact mechanics]]).&lt;ref name="Zhai_2016"/&gt; Surfaces of metallic contacts generally exhibit an external layer of oxide material and [[adsorbtion|adsorbed]] water molecules, which lead to capacitor-type junctions at weakly contacting [[Asperity_(materials_science)|asperities]] and resistor type contacts at strongly contacting asperities. Over time, the contact resistance at an interface relaxes, particularly at weakly contacting surfaces, through current induced welding and dielectric breakdown, in a process also known as resistance creep.&lt;ref name="Zhai_2015"/&gt; The coupling of [[surface chemistry]], contact mechanics and charge transport mechanisms needs to be accounted for in the mechanistic evaluation of ECR phenomena.

==Quantum limit==
When a conductor has spatial dimensions close to &lt;math&gt;2\pi/k_F&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_F&lt;/math&gt; is [[Fermi surface|Fermi wavevector]] of the conducting material, [[Ohm's law]] does not hold anymore. These small devices are called [[quantum point contact]]s. Their conductance must be an integer multiple of the value &lt;math&gt;2e^2/h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge|electronic charge]] and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]]. Quantum point contacts behave more like [[waveguide]]s than the classical wires of everyday life and may be described by the [[Rolf Landauer|Landauer]] scattering formalism.&lt;ref name="Landauer_1976"/&gt; Point-contact [[quantum tunneling|tunneling]] is an important technique for characterizing [[superconductor]]s.

==Other forms of contact resistance==
Measurements of [[thermal conductivity]] are also subject to contact resistance, with particular significance in heat transport through granular media. Similarly, a drop in [[hydrostatic pressure]] (analogous to electrical [[voltage]]) occurs when [[fluid flow]] transitions from one channel to another.

==Significance==
Bad contacts are the cause of failure or poor performance in a wide variety of electrical devices. For example, corroded [[jump start (vehicle)|jumper cable]] clamps can frustrate attempts to start a [[automobile|vehicle]] that has a low [[Lead-acid battery|battery]]. Dirty or [[corrosion|corroded]] contacts on a [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or its holder can give the false impression that the fuse is blown. A sufficiently high contact resistance can cause substantial [[Joule heating|heating]] in a high current device. Unpredictable or noisy contacts are a major cause of the failure of electrical equipment.

With a slightly shorter wheelbase than the sedan from which it derives, the Sandero was developed at Renault's Technocentre near Paris, France, in conjunction with the regional engineering centers based in [[Brazil]] and Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dacia reveals Sandero, its new compact hatchback|url=http://www.daciagroup.com/en/press/press-releases/2008/dacia-reveals-sandero-its-new-compact-hatchback|publisher=Dacia|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=4 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sandero"&gt;{{cite web|title=Renault unveils Sandero, an attractive, spacious saloon intended for the South American Market|url=http://www.renault.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/Communiqu%C3%A9%20de%20presse/en-EN/Pieces%20jointes/14842_CP_Renault_B90_DEF_GB_erratum29112007.pdf|publisher=Renault|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed for the first time at the 2007 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Com dimensões recordes, Sandero chega em dezembro|url=http://carpress.uol.com.br/reportagem/item19565.shl|publisher=Carpress|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made its formal market debut in Brazil, as a Renault model, in December 2007, being the first Renault model to debut outside Europe.&lt;ref name="sandero"/&gt; 

It was launched subsequently in Europe as a Dacia model at the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dacia Sandero - dezvăluit în premieră mondială la Geneva|url=http://www.informatiiauto.ro/dacia-sandero-dezvaluit-in-premiera-mondiala-la-geneva-sid2266.html|publisher=Informaţii Auto|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=4 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renault]] began manufacturing the Sandero in South Africa in February 2009,&lt;ref name="renault"&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Registration Document|url=http://www.renault.com/en/lists/archivesdocuments/renault%20-%202011%20registration%20document.pdf|publisher=Renault|page=21|date=23 March 2012|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 2009, in Russia. A Renault version is also manufactured in [[Colombia]] for its home market and for export to countries including [[Chile]].

===Facelift===
In May 2011, Renault launched in Brazil a facelifted version of Sandero, which enjoys a new face and a revised interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dacia Sandero Facelift: first official photos|url=http://www.car-addicts.com/latest-news/dacia-sandero-facelift|publisher=Car-Addicts.com|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Colombia, the facelifted versions of the [[Renault Sandero]] and the [[Renault Sandero#Sandero Stepway|Renault Stepway]] were revealed at the beginning of 2012 with some differences from the other versions sold, such as the location of the doors locks and the passenger's airbag.

===Safety===
On the passive safety front, Sandero has been designed to meet the requirements of European regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dacia Sandero (2009)|url=http://www.netcarshow.com/dacia/2009-sandero/|publisher=NetCarShow.com|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on equipment level, Dacia Sandero comes with up to four airbags. In terms of active safety Dacia Sandero features the latest generation Bosch 8.1 ABS which incorporates EBD (Electronic Brakeforce Distribution) and EBA (Emergency Brake Assist).

[[Euro NCAP]] rated the Dacia Sandero fitted with the basic level of safety equipment and also crash tested the car equipped with the 'safety pack', which is standard on some variants, and optional on others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/Content-Web-Article/b64668ef-6965-4549-9225-975a338068f3/the-last-time-best-selling-cars-score-five-stars.aspx |title=EuroNCAP Press Release |publisher=Euroncap.com |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crash test]] for basic level Dacia Sandero equipped with front seatbelt load limiters, driver frontal airbag and front passenger frontal airbag, scored 3 stars for adults, 4 stars for children occupants and 1 star for pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/dacia_sandero_2008/340.aspx |title=EuroNCAP test |publisher=Euroncap.com |date= |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EuroNCAP test for the 'safety pack' model equipped with side body and head airbags and front seatbelt pretensioners, received a score of 31 for adults, 38 for children occupants and 6 for pedestrians, these results being rated as 4 from 5 stars for adults and children occupants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/dacia_sandero_2008/100340.aspx |title=EuroNCAP 'safety pack' test |publisher=Euroncap.com |date= |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sandero R.S. 2.0===
In August 2014, [[Renault Sport]] CEO Patrice Ratti revealed to Autocar magazine that a [[hot hatch]] RS version of Sandero was in the works, following test cars being spotted in early to mid 2015. Using the 150 PS (148&amp;nbsp;hp) 2.0 16v [[Renault F-Type engine|F4R engine]], and capable of accelerating from 0 to 62&amp;nbsp;mph (100 kph) in 8.0 seconds, the Sandero RS is the first Renault Sport to be manufactured outside France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promotor.ro/masini-noi/news/renault-sandero-rs-dezvaluit-oficial-imagini-si-video-oficiale-14473741 Renault Sandero RS, dezvăluit oficial] {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in September 2015 in Brazil, different from the normal versions with three types of ECU control: normal, sport and sport+, four disc brakes with ABS, Clio RS steering wheel, electronic stability program and a six speed manual transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.renault.com.br/veiculos/conheca-nossa-gama/sandero-rs.html R.S. 2.0] at renault.com.br&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and reception===
In January 2013, British magazine ''[[What Car?]]'' awarded the second generation Sandero as the ''Best supermini less than £12,000'', noting that "it offers something genuinely new and different in that it brings real space for bargain prices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dacia Sandero - Best Supermini less than £12,000|url=http://www.whatcar.com/awards/superminis/dacia-sandero-best-buy.html|publisher=What Car?|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''What Car?'' awarded the Sandero again in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dacia Sandero - Best Supermini less than £12,000 by What Car?|url=http://www.dacia.co.uk/about-dacia/dacia-news/dacia-sandero-wins-whatcar-award2014.jsp|publisher=What Car?|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dacia.co.uk/about-dacia/dacia-news/dacia-whatcar2015-award.jsp|title=Three-in-a-row for Dacia at What Car?

''[[Auto Express]]'' assessed a 4 out of 5 to the Sandero Stepway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/dacia/sandero/stepway|title=The Dacia Sandero Stepway adds a touch of rugged off-road presence to the value-focused Sandero hatch|publisher=Auto Express|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Top Gear''==
The Sandero was the focus of a running gag on the British television programme ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''. In [[Top Gear (series 11)|Series 11]] and [[Top Gear (series 12)|Series 12]], after Dacia sent the show a press kit, presenter [[James May]] would often exclaim "Good News!" and explain a fact about the Sandero during the show's news segment, to which [[Jeremy Clarkson]] would reply "Great!" before abruptly changing the subject. 

The gag was also featured in ''The Big Book of Top Gear'', with a page proclaiming "Good News! The Dacia Sandero is in this book!" In later episodes, the presenters switched sides of the gag, with Clarkson bringing up news about the car and May shrugging it off. In the first episode of [[Top Gear (series 13)|Series 13]], when May said he had "Good News", Clarkson immediately asked "Is it the Dacia Sandero?", to which a seemingly bewildered May replied, "No..." The car was not mentioned for the remainder of the series.

In [[Top Gear (series 14)|Series 14]], during a visit to Romania, Clarkson bought May a used Sandero as a gift. After returning from a test drive, May parked the car behind an idling truck, and exited. As May praised the car to his co-presenters, the lorry reversed into the Sandero, damaging the passenger side. The joke was continued in [[Top Gear (series 15)|Series 15]], except this time referring to the [[Dacia Duster]], and in [[Top Gear (series 18)|Series 18]], when May brought up the new [[Dacia Lodgy]]. The gag returned in the first and third episodes of [[Top Gear (series 19)|Series 19]], as well as the second and fifth episodes of [[Top Gear (series 20)|Series 20]]. 

The second generation Sandero was featured alongside the [[Ford Fiesta]] and [[Volkswagen Up|Volkswagen Up!]] in [[Top Gear (series 21)|series 21]] as part of a 1.0L three cylinder cars challenge, which ended with Clarkson (Up!) and May (Sandero) having to drive into the abandoned city of [[Chernobyl (city)|Chernobyl]], with Hammond's Fiesta having already run out of fuel. The Sandero was the only car to make it back out and complete all the challenges.  May pointed out the large price difference between the Fiesta and the Sandero, stating that at £17,500 Vs £7,500 he could afford to lose his car, buy another - and still be better off than Hammond.&lt;ref&gt;Top Gear Series 21, episode 3:
*May: "It's quite expensive though, isn't it?"
*Hammond:"Well..."
*May: "How much is it?"
*Hammond: "Seventeen and a half."
*May: "Seventeen and a half thousand pounds!?"
*Hammond: "Yep."
*Clarkson: "And how much is yours?"
*May: "Seven and a half."
*Clarkson: "That's a big price gulf Hammond..."
*May: "I can afford to lose this and just go and buy another one - and I'm still better off than you."&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the comical and sarcastic nature of the recurring bit, May has stated that he has a genuine affinity for the Sandero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/columnists/jamesmay/6670473/Dacia-Sandero-In-praise-of-the-anti-fashion-car.html|title=''Dacia Sandero: In praise of the anti-fashion car''|author=May, James|date=1 December 2009|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sources, its second generation was intended to become a third ''[[Star in a Reasonably Priced Car|Reasonably Priced Car]]'' on ''Top Gear'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/news/we-hear-dacia-sandero-is-top-gear-s-next-reasonably-priced-car-61613.html|title=''Dacia Sandero Is Top Gear's Next Reasonably Priced Car''|author=Radu, Mihnea|date=19 June 2013|publisher=autoevolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; however its use was prevented due to its delayed release in Britain.

'''Daylight redirecting film''' (DRF) is a thin, flexible plastic film which can be applied to a window to refract or reflect incoming light upwards, so that the deeper parts of the room are lit more evenly. It can be used as a substitute for opaque blinds.&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt; It is a form of [[prism lighting]].

==Function==

&lt;br/&gt;
The human eye's response to light [[Weber–Fechner law#Vision|is non-linear]]: halving the light level does not halve the perceived brightness of a space, it makes it look only slightly dimmer.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} If light is redistributed from the brightest parts of a room to the dimmest, the room therefore appears brighter overall, and more space can be given a useful and comfortable level of illumination (see before and after images from an 1899 article, left). This can reduce the need for artificial lighting.

[[Refraction]] and [[total internal reflection]] inside [[prism (optics)|optical prisms]] can bend beams of light. This bending of the light allows it to be redistributed.

While the films do save energy from lighting, the savings vary substantially by climate, [[aspect (geography)|aspect]], electricity costs, and existing lighting type. At 2014 costs, including labour, payback time may be measured in decades.&lt;ref name=EEET/&gt;

This film increases the sunlight area by 200%.

It is effective not only for lighting energy but also for cooling and heating energy saving. With the growing interest in green energy buildings, the interest in these Daylight redirecting films is also growing.

==Manufacture==
Daylight redirecting film is made of [[acrylic resin|acrylic]]&lt;ref name=EEET/&gt; on a flexible polyester backing, one side coated with a [[pressure-sensitive adhesive]] (to make it peel-and-stick).&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt;

There are two types of film. Some film is moulded with tiny prisms, making a flexible peel-and-stick miniature prismatic panel. The prisms are joined at the edges into a sheet. A prism sheet is somewhat like a linear [[Fresnel lens]], but each ridge may be identical. Unlike a Fresnel lens, the light is not intended to be focused, but used for [[anidolic lighting]].

Other film is moulded with thin near-horizontal voids protruding into or through the acrylic; the slits [[total internal reflection|reflect]] light hitting their top surfaces upwards.&lt;ref name=TIR&gt;https://sweets.construction.com/swts_content_files/154130/2263001.pdf{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt; Refraction is minimized, to avoid colouring the light.&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt;

The reflection-based films are more [[Transparency and translucency|transparent (both are translucent)]], but they tend to send the light up at the ceiling, not deeper into the room. Refraction-based films are translucent rather than transparent, but offer finer control over the direction of the outgoing light beam; the film can be made in a variety of prism shapes to refract light by a variety of angles. Refraction-based films are a lighter modern version of glass [[prism tile]]s.

Daylight redirecting window film was initially made of one redirecting film and one glare-reducing diffusing film, often located on different interior surfaces of a double-glazed window,&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt; but integrated single films are now available.&lt;ref name=OOtM/&gt;
Due to the prism structure, it works only at certain angles. By making DRF blind, you can always keep the same effect. 
Add UV blocking filters to the film to block harmful UV rays.

The '''distribution of [[lightning]]''', or the incidence of individual strikes, in any particular place is highly variable{{clarify|date=July 2018}}{{Fix|text=variable over time, or what?}}, but lightning does have an underlying [[spatial distribution]].

==Ratios of lightning types==
The lightning flash rate averaged over the Earth for intra-cloud (IC) + cloud-to-cloud (CC) to cloud-to-ground (CG) is in the ratio: (IC+CC):CG = 3:1. The base of the negative region in a cloud is normally at roughly the elevation where freezing occurs. The closer this region is to the ground, the more likely cloud-to-ground strikes are. In the [[tropics]], where the freeze zone is higher, the (IC+CC):CG ratio is about 9:1. In Norway, at latitude 60° N, where the freezing elevation is lower, the (IC+CC):CG ratio is about 1:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast05dec_1/|date=2001-12-05|title=Where LightningStrikes|publisher=NASA Science.

Areas with almost no lightning are the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]], closely followed by the oceans which have only 0.1 to 1 strikes/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/yr.]]

The map on the right shows that lightning is not distributed evenly around the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.easa.europa.eu/safety-and-research/research-projects/docs/large-aeroplanes/EASA.2008_5.pdf |date=November 2010 |title=Hail Threat Standardisation |author1=P.R.

The [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]]s and the areas over the oceans have the fewest lightning strikes. The place where lightning occurs most often (according to the data from 2004 to 2005) {{Fix|text=needs updating}} is near the small village of [[Kifuka]] in the mountains of eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Af/CongoDR/SudKivu/Kifuka.htm|title=Kifuka – place where lightning strikes most often |accessdate=November 21, 2010|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[elevation]] is around {{convert|975|m|ft|-2}}. This region received 158 lightning strikes per square kilometer (409 per sq mi) a year.&lt;ref name="NOAA freq" /&gt;

Above the Catatumbo river, which feeds [[Lake Maracaibo]] in Venezuela, [[Catatumbo lightning]] flashes several times per minute and this place has the highest number of lightning strikes per square kilometer in the world. [[Singapore]] has one of the highest rates of lightning activity in the world.&lt;ref name="nea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=1203 |title=Lightning Activity in Singapore |accessdate=September 24, 2007 |publisher=National Environmental Agency |year=2002 |author=National Environmental Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224804/http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=1203 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Teresina]] in northern [[Brazil]] has the third-highest rate of occurrences of lightning strikes in the world. The surrounding region is referred to as the ''Chapada do Corisco'' ("Flash Lightning Flatlands").&lt;ref name="Paesi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paesionline.com/south_america/brazil/teresina/introduction.asp|title=Teresina: Vacations and Tourism|accessdate=September 24, 2007|publisher=Paesi Online|author=Paesi Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the west coast has the fewest lightning strikes, and Central [[Florida]] sees more lightning than any other area. Florida has the largest number of recorded strikes during summer. Much of Florida is a peninsula, bordered by the ocean on three sides with a subtropical climate. The result is the nearly daily development of clouds that produce [[thunderstorm]]s. For example, in what is called "Lightning Alley", an area from [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], there are as many as 50 strikes per square mile (about 20 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) per year.&lt;ref name="alley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/news/lightning_alley.html|title=Staying Safe in Lightning Alley|accessdate=September 24, 2007|publisher=[[NASA]]|year=2007|author=NASA|authorlink=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridaenvironment.com/programs/fe00703.htm |title=Summer Lightning Ahead |accessdate=September 24, 2007 |publisher=Florida Environment.com |year=2000 |author=Kevin Pierce |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012160959/http://floridaenvironment.com/programs/fe00703.htm |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empire State Building]] in New York City is struck by lightning on average 23 times each year, and was once struck 8 times in 24&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="uman2"&gt;Uman, Martin A.'

Lightning strikes most frequently in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. &lt;br&gt; ''Combined 1995–2003 data from the Optical Transient Detector and 1998–2003 data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor.'']]

Before technology was developed to accurately detect and record lightning flashes, climatologies were based upon the number of audible detection of thunder. The keraunic (or ceraunic) level was the average number of days per year when thunder was heard in a given area. A map of isokeraunic contours was used to give a rough estimate of relative lightning frequencies. However, variations in population, the distance sound travels due to terrain made such maps quite spurious, and human hearing made such maps imprecise. It also could not hope to differentiate between different types of lightning.

Electronic [[Lightning detection|lightning sensors]] advanced during the 20th century using radio wave disruptions. Originally the expense of such instruments caused only sporadic development. However a small set of sensors in the U.S. employed during a 1979 project by [[NOAA]]’s [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] grew by bits and pieces into the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN), achieving nationwide coverage in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Orville |first1=Richard |title=Development of the National Lightning Detection Network |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |date=February 2008 |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=180–190 |bibcode=2008BAMS...89..180O |doi=10.1175/BAMS-89-2-180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vaisala]] is now the operator and primary distributor of data from the NLDN, and developed the Canadian Lightning Detection Network (CLDN) as of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vaisala.com/sites/default/files/documents/CLDN%20Brochure%20B210413EN-a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The EUCLID network is the European shared network, covering most of the continent apart from some far eastern nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euclid.org&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative amateur development spurred the formation of the Blitzortung community, which offers real-time lightning strike data from most of the world (as well as historical data dating back to 2008) under the Creative Commons license.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.blitzortung.org/contact.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite lightning measurements began in 1997 when [[NASA]] and [[National Space Development Agency of Japan|National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan]] launched the [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission#Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS)|Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS)]] aboard the aboard the [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission|TRMM satellite]], providing periodic scan swaths over tropical and sub-tropical portions of the globe until the satellite's was lost in 2015. In 2017 NOAA started deployment of [[GOES-16#Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM)|Geostationary Lightning Mappers]] aboard their [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite#Development of GOES-R series|GOES-R class satellites]], offering continual coverage of much of the land within the western Hemisphere.

A '''double layer''' is a [[structure]] in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] consisting of two parallel layers of opposite electrical charge. The sheets of charge, which are not necessarily planar, produce localised excursions of [[electric potential]], resulting in a relatively strong electric field between the layers and weaker but more extensive compensating fields outside, which restore the global potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joos|first1=G.|title=Theoretical Physics|date=1951|publisher=Blackie &amp; Son Ltd.|location=London &amp; Glasgow|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ions and electrons within the double layer are accelerated, decelerated, or deflected by the electric field, depending on their direction of motion.

Double layers can be created in [[discharge tube]]s, where sustained energy is provided within the layer for electron acceleration by an external power source. Double layers are claimed to have been observed in the  [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and are invoked in [[Astrophysics|astrophysical]] applications. Similarly, a double layer in the auroral region requires some external driver to produce electron acceleration.

Electrostatic double layers are especially common in current-carrying plasmas, and are very thin (typically ten [[Debye length]]s), compared to the sizes of the plasmas that contain them. Other names for a double layer are electrostatic double layer, electric double layer, plasma double layers.  The term ‘electrostatic shock’ in the [[magnetosphere]] has been applied to electric fields oriented at an [[oblique angle]] to the magnetic field in such a way that the perpendicular electric field is much stronger than the parallel electric field,&lt;ref&gt;Temerin, M.; Mozer, F. S., "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1987dla..conf..295T&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c17461 Double Layers Above the Aurora]" (1987) NASA Conference Publication, #2469&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Block, L. P.

Double layers are conceptually related to the concept of a 'sheath' (''see'' [[Debye sheath]]).   An early review of double layers from laboratory experiment and simulations is provided by Torvén.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Torvén | first1 = S | title = Formation of Double Layers in Laboratory Plasmas |year=1976 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1979wisp.proc..109T&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c26029| journal = Astrophysics and Space Science Library | volume = 74 | issue = | page = 109 | bibcode=1979wisp.proc..109T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Double layer classification ==
[[Image:Double layer formation.png|thumb|320px|Double layer formation. Formation of a double layer requires electrons to move between two adjacent regions (Diagram 1, top) causing a charge separation. An electrostatic potential imbalance may result (Diagram 2, bottom)]]

Double layers may be classified in the following ways:
*''Weak'' and ''strong'' double layers. The strength of a double layer is expressed as the ratio of the [[potential difference|potential drop]] in comparison with the plasma's equivalent  [[thermal energy]], or in comparison with the [[rest mass]] energy of the [[electron]]s. A double layer is said to be strong if the potential drop within the layer is greater than the equivalent thermal energy of the plasma's components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamamoto | first1 = Takashi | last2 = Kan | first2 = J. R. | year = 1985| title = Double layer formation due to current injection | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1985P%26SS...33..853Y&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c18563| journal = Planetary and Space Science | volume = 33 | issue = 7| pages = 853–861 | bibcode=1985P&amp;SS...33..853Y | doi=10.1016/0032-0633(85)90040-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''Relativistic'' or ''non-relativistic'' double layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlqvist|first1=P.|title=On the physics of relativistic double layers|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|date=1982|volume=87|page=21|doi=10.1007/bf00648904|bibcode=1982Ap&amp;SS..87...21C}}&lt;/ref&gt; A double layer is said to be [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] if the potential drop within the layer is comparable to the [[rest mass]] energy (~512KeV) of the electron.  Double layers of such energy are to be found in laboratory experiments.  The charge density is low between the two opposing potential regions and the double layer is similar to the charge distribution in a [[capacitor]] in that respect. 
*''Current carrying double layers'' These double layers may be generated by current-driven plasma instabilities that amplify variations of the plasma density.  One example of these instabilities is the [[Farley–Buneman instability]], which occurs when the streaming velocity of electrons (basically the current density divided by the electron density) exceeds the electron thermal velocity of the plasma. It occurs in collisional plasmas having a neutral component, and is driven by drift currents. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}
*''Current-free double layers'' These occur at the boundary between plasma regions with different plasma properties.  A plasma may have a higher electron temperature, and thermal velocity, on one side of a boundary layer than on the other.  The same may apply for plasma densities.  Charged particles exchanged between the regions may enable potential differences to be maintained between them locally.   The overall charge density, as in all double layers, will be neutral.  
Potential imbalance will be neutralised by electron (1&amp;3) and [[ion]] (2&amp;4) migration, unless the potential [[gradient]]s are sustained by an external energy source. Under most laboratory situations, unlike [[outer space]] conditions, charged particles may effectively originate within the double layer, by ionization at the [[anode]] or [[cathode]], and be sustained.

The figure shows the localised perturbation of potential produced by an idealised double layer consisting of two oppositely charged discs. The perturbation is zero at a distance from the double layer in every direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=D.A.|title=Acceleration in the Auroral and Beyond|date=1998|page=12|isbn=9780750305334|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond/Bryant/9780750305334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an incident charged particle, such as a precipitating auroral electron, encounters such a static or quasistatic structure in the magnetosphere, provided that the particle energy exceeds half the electric potential difference within the double layer, it will pass through without any net change in energy.   Incident particles with less energy than this will also experience no net change in energy but will undergo more overall deflection.

[[Image:DL Surface Plot.jpg|thumb|600px]]

Four distinct regions of a double layer can be identified, which affect charged particles passing through it, or within it:
# A positive potential side of the double layer where electrons are accelerated towards it;
# A positive potential within the double layer where electrons are decelerated;
# A negative potential within the double layer where electrons are decelerated; and
# A negative potential side of the double layer where electrons are accelerated.

Double layers will tend to be transient in the magnetosphere, as any charge imbalance will become neutralised, unless there is a sustained external source of energy to maintain them as there is under laboratory conditions.

===Double layer formation mechanisms===
The details of the formation mechanism depend on the environment of the plasma (e.g. double layers in the laboratory, [[ionosphere]], [[solar wind]], [[nuclear fusion]], etc.). Proposed mechanisms for their formation have included:

== Features and characteristics of double layers ==

*'''Thickness''': The production of a double layer requires regions with a significant excess of positive or negative charge, that is, where [[Plasma (physics)#Potentials|quasi-neutrality]] is violated. In general, quasi-neutrality can only be violated on scales of the [[Debye length]]. The thickness of a double layer is of the order of ten Debye lengths, which is a few centimeters in the [[ionosphere]], a few tens of meters in the [[interplanetary medium]], and tens of kilometers in the [[intergalactic medium]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
*'''Electrostatic potential distribution''': As described under double layer classification above, there are effectively four distinct regions of a double layer where incoming charged particles will be accelerated or decelerated along their trajectory .  Within the double layer the two opposing charge distributions will tend to become neutralised by internal charged particle motion. 
*'''Particle flux''': For non-relativistic current carrying double layers, electrons carry most of the current. The Langmuir condition states that the ratio of the electron and the ion current across the layer is given by the square root of the mass ratio of the ions to the electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Block, L. P. "[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/Ap%2BSS/0055//0000060.000.html A double layer review]" (1978) ''Astrophysics and Space Science'', vol. 55, no. 1, May 1978, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; For relativistic double layers the current ratio is 1; i.e. the current is carried equally by electrons and ions. 
*'''Energy supply''': The instantaneous voltage drop across a current-carrying double layer is proportional to the total current, and is similar to that across a resistive element (or load), which dissipates energy in an electric circuit.    A double layer cannot supply net energy on its own.
*'''Stability''': Double layers in laboratory plasmas may be stable or unstable depending on the parameter regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Torvén | first1 = S | title = High-voltage double layers in a magnetised plasma column |year=1982 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1982JPhD...15.1943T&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c12484| journal = Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics | volume = 15 | issue = 10| pages = 1943–1949 | bibcode=1982JPhD...15.1943T | doi=10.1088/0022-3727/15/10/012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various types of instabilities may occur, often arising due to the formation of [[Charged particle beam|beam]]s of ions and electrons. Unstable double layers are ''noisy'' in the sense that they produce oscillations across a wide frequency band. A lack of plasma stability may also lead to a sudden change in configuration often referred to as an [[explosion]] (and hence ''exploding double layer''). In one example, the region enclosed in the double layer rapidly expands and evolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Song | first1 = B | last2 = Angelo | first2 = N D | last3 = Merlino | first3 = R L | title = Stability of a spherical double layer produced through ionization |year=1992 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1992JPhD...25..938S&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c22502| journal = Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics | volume = 25 | issue = 6| pages = 938–941 | bibcode=1992JPhD...25..938S | doi=10.1088/0022-3727/25/6/006}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[explosion]] of this type was first discovered in [[mercury arc rectifier]]s  used in high-power direct-current transmission lines, where the voltage drop across the device was seen to increase by several orders of magnitude.

*'''Magnetised plasmas''': Double layers can form in both magnetised and unmagnetised plasmas.
*'''Cellular nature''': While double layers are relatively thin, they will spread over the entire cross surface of a laboratory container. Likewise where adjacent plasma regions have different properties, double layers will form and tend to cellularise the different regions.&lt;ref&gt;Alfvén, H.

*'''Energy transfer''': Double layers can facilitate the transfer of electrical energy into kinetic energy, dW/dt=I•ΔV where I is the electric current dissipating energy into a double layer with a voltage drop of ΔV. Alfvén points out that the current may well consist exclusively of low-energy particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alfvén | first1 = H. | last2 = Carlqvist | first2 = P. | year = 1978 | title = Interstellar clouds and the formation of stars | url = http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1978Ap%26SS..55..487A | journal = Astrophysics and Space Science | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 487–509 | bibcode=1978Ap&amp;SS..55..487A | doi = 10.1007/BF00642272 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Torvén ''et al.'' have postulated that plasma may spontaneously transfer magnetically stored energy into kinetic energy by electric double layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Torvén | first1 = S | last2 = Lindberg | first2 = L | last3 = Carpenter | first3 = R T | title = Spontaneous transfer of magnetically stored energy to kinetic energy by electric double layers |year=1985 | url = http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0741-3335/27/2/005| journal = Plasma Phys.

Ion thrusters can provide a more direct case of energy transfer from opposing potentials in the form of double layers produced by an external electric field.  
*'''Oblique double layer''': An oblique double layer has electric fields that are not parallel to the ambient magnetic field; i.e., it is not field-aligned.
*'''Simulation''': Double layers may be modelled using kinetic computer models like particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. In some cases the plasma is treated as essentially one- or two-dimensional to reduce the computational cost of a simulation.
*'''Bohm Criterion''': A double layer cannot exist under all circumstances. In order to produce an electric field that vanishes at the boundaries of the double layer, an existence criterion says that there is a maximum to the temperature of the ambient plasma. This is the so-called Bohm criterion.&lt;ref&gt;Raadu, Michael A.; Rasmussen, J. Juul "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1988Ap%26SS.144...43R&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c10172 Dynamical aspects of electrostatic double layers]" (1988) ''Astrophysics and Space Science'' (ISSN 0004-640X), vol. 144, no. 1&amp;ndash;2, May 1988, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of double layers==

This brief account of the advent of double layers in research elaborates on some information in the chronological list of events provided above.

[[Image:Alfven-wave-double-layer.gif|thumb|300px|A cluster of double layers forming in an [[Alfvén wave]], about a sixth of the distance from the left. Click for more details]]
It was already known in the 1920s that a plasma has a limited capacity for current maintenance, [[Irving Langmuir]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Langmuir | first1 = Irving | title = The Interaction of Electron and Positive Ion Space Charges in Cathode Sheaths| year = 1929 | journal = Physical Review | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 954–989 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1929PhRv...33..954L&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c20559 | doi=10.1103/physrev.33.954 | bibcode=1929PhRv...33..954L}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterized double layers in the laboratory and called these structures double-sheaths.  In the 1950s a thorough  study of double layers  started in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvnb|Schönhuber|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation not found|date=February 2007}} Many groups are still working on this topic theoretically, experimentally and numerically. It was first proposed by [[Hannes Alfvén]] (the developer of magnetohydrodynamics from laboratory experiments) that the polar lights or Aurora Borealis are created by electrons accelerated in the magnetosphere of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Alfvén, H., "On the theory of magnetic storms and aurorae", ''Tellus'', 10, 104,. 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; He supposed that the electrons were accelerated electrostatically by an electric field localized in a small volume  bounded by two charged regions, and the so-called double layer would accelerate electrons earthwards.   Since then other mechanisms involving wave-particle interactions have been proposed as being feasible, from extensive spatial and temporal in situ studies of [[aurora]]l particle characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=D.A|title=The roles of static and dynamic electric fields in the auroral acceleration region|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=June 2002|volume=107|issue=A6|pages=1077|doi=10.1029/2001JA900162|bibcode=2002JGRA..107.1077B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many investigations of the magnetosphere and auroral regions have been made using rockets and satellites. McIlwain discovered from a rocket flight in 1960 that the energy spectrum of auroral electrons exhibited a peak that was thought then to be too sharp to be produced by a random process and which suggested, therefore, that an ordered process was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIlwain|first1=C E|title=Direct Measurement of Particles Producing Visible Auroras|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|year=1960|volume=65|issue=9|page=2727|doi=10.1029/JZ065i009p02727|bibcode=1960JGR....65.2727M}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It was reported in 1977 that satellites had detected the signature of double layers as electrostatic shocks in the magnetosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Mozer, F. S. "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1977PhRvL..38..292M&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42ca922c9c26692 Observations of paired electrostatic shocks in the polar magnetosphere]" (1977) ''Physical Review Letters'', vol. 38, Feb. 7, 1977, pp. 292&amp;ndash;295&lt;/ref&gt;  indications of electric fields parallel to the geomagnetic field lines was obtained by the Viking satellite,&lt;ref&gt;Boström, Rolf "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1992ITPS...20..756B&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c00530 Observations of weak double layers on auroral field lines]" (1992) IEEE ''Transactions on Plasma Science'' (ISSN 0093-3813), vol. 20, no. 6, pp. 756&amp;ndash;763&lt;/ref&gt; which measures the differential potential structures in the magnetosphere with probes mounted on 40m long booms. These probes measured the local particle density and the potential difference between two points 80m apart. Asymmetric potential excursions with respect to 0 V were measured, and interpreted as a double layer with a net potential within the region.   Magnetospheric double layers typically have a strength &lt;math&gt;e\phi_{DL}/k_B T_e \approx 0.1&lt;/math&gt; (where the electron temperature is assumed to lie in the range &lt;math&gt;2 eV \leq k_B T_e \leq 20 eV&lt;/math&gt;) and are therefore weak.  A series of such double layers would tend to merge, much like a string of bar magnets, and dissipate, even within a rarefied  plasma.  It has yet to be explained how any overall localised charge distribution in the form of double layers might provide a source of energy for auroral electrons precipitated into the atmosphere.

Interpretation of the [[Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer|FAST]] spacecraft data proposed strong double layers in the auroral acceleration region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ergun | first1 = R. E. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Parallel electric fields in the upward current region of the aurora: Indirect and direct observations| year = 2002 | journal = Physics of Plasmas | volume = 9 | issue = 9| pages = 3685–3694 | doi=10.1063/1.1499120 | bibcode=2002PhPl....9.3685E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong double layers have also been reported in the downward current region by Andersson et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Characteristics of parallel electric fields in the downward current region of the aurora| year = 2002 | journal = Physics of Plasmas | volume = 9 | issue = 8| pages = 3600–3609 | doi=10.1063/1.1490134 | bibcode=2002PhPl....9.3600A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel electric fields with amplitudes reaching nearly 1 V/m were inferred to be confined to a thin layer of approximately 10 Debye lengths. It is stated that the structures moved ‘at roughly the ion acoustic speed in the direction of the accelerated electrons, i.e., anti-earthward.’ That raises a question of what role, if any, double layers might play in accelerating auroral electrons that are precipitated downwards into the atmosphere from the magnetosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=D.A., and G.M.Courtier|title=Electrostatic double layers as auroral particle accelerators - a problem|journal=AnGeo Comm.|date=2015|volume=33|issue=4|pages=481–482|doi=10.5194/angeo-33-481-2015|bibcode=2015AnGeo..33..481B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possible role of precipitating electrons from 1-10keV themselves generating such observed double layers or electric fields has seldom been considered or analysed.  Equally, the general question of how such double layers might be generated from an alternative source of energy, or what the spatial distribution of electric charge might be to produce net energy changes, is seldom addressed. Under laboratory conditions an external power supply is available.  
                      
In the laboratory, double layers can be created in different devices. They are investigated in double plasma machines, triple plasma machines, and [[Q-machine]]s. The stationary potential structures that can be measured in these machines agree very well with what one would expect theoretically. An example of a laboratory double layer can be seen in the figure below, taken from Torvén and Lindberg (1980), where we can see how well-defined and confined is the potential drop of a double layer in a double plasma machine.
One of the interesting aspects of the experiment by Torvén and Lindberg (1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Torvén | first1 = S. | last2 = Lindberg | first2 = L. | title = Properties of a fluctuating double layer in a magnetized plasma column| year = 1982 | journal = Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics | volume = 13 | issue = 12| pages = 2285–2300 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1980pfdl.rept.....T&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c17951 | bibcode=1980pfdl.rept.....T | doi = 10.1088/0022-3727/13/12/014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is that not only did they measure the potential structure in the double plasma machine but they also found high-frequency fluctuating electric fields at the high-potential side of the double layer (also shown in the figure). These fluctuations are probably due to a beam-plasma interaction outside the double layer, which excites plasma turbulence. Their observations are consistent with experiments on electromagnetic radiation emitted by double layers in a double plasma machine by Volwerk (1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Volwerk | first1 = M | title = Radiation from electrostatic double layers in laboratory plasmas| year = 1993 | journal = Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics | volume = 26 | issue = 8| pages = 1192–1202 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1993JPhD...26.1192V&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c03565 | doi=10.1088/0022-3727/26/8/007 | bibcode=1993JPhD...26.1192V}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, however, also observed radiation from the double layer itself.

The power of these fluctuations has a maximum around the plasma frequency of the ambient plasma.  It was later reported that the electrostatic high-frequency fluctuations near the double layer can be concentrated in a narrow region, sometimes called the hf-spike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gunell | first1 = H. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Bursts of high-frequency plasma waves at an electric double layer |year=1996 | journal = Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 643–654 | doi=10.1088/0022-3727/29/3/025 | bibcode=1996JPhD...29..643G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, both radio emissions, near the plasma frequency, and whistler waves at much lower frequencies were seen to emerge from this region.&lt;ref&gt;Brenning, N., et al.   (2006)  "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006JGRA..11111212B Radiation from an electron beam in a magnetized plasma: Whistler mode wave packets]"''Journal of Geophysical Research, Volume 111'', Volume 111, Issue A11, CiteID A11212&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar whistler wave structures were observed together with electron beams near Saturn's moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]],&lt;ref&gt;Gurnett, D. A., et al. "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011GeoRL..3806102G Auroral hiss, electron beams and standing Alfvén wave currents near Saturn's moon Enceladus]" (2011) ''Geophysical Research Letters'', Volume 38, Issue 6, CiteID L06102&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting the possible presence of a double layer at lower altitude.

A recent development in double layer experiments in the laboratory is the investigation of so-called stairstep double layers. It has been observed that a potential drop in a plasma column can be divided into different parts. Transitions from a single double layer into two-, three-, or greater-step double layers are strongly sensitive to the boundary conditions of the plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hershkowitz|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation not found|date=February 2007}}

Unlike experiments in the laboratory, the concept of such double layers in the magnetosphere, and any role in creating the aurora, suffers from there so far being no identified steady source of energy.  The electric potential characteristic of double layers might however indicate that, those observed in the auroral zone are a secondary product of precipitating electrons that have been energized in other ways, such as by electrostatic waves.  
Some scientists have suggested a role of double layers in solar flares.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, S. S.; Ter Haar, D. "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1978Ap%26SS..56...89H&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c28323 The Alfvén-Carlquist double-layer theory of solar flares]" (1978) ''Astrophysics and Space Science'' vol. 56, no. 1, June 1978, pp. 89&amp;ndash;107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan, J. I. "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1989PASAu...8...29K&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c28323 A model for solar flares invoking weak double layers]" (1989) ''Astronomical Society of Australia'', Proceedings (ISSN 0066-9997), vol. 8, no. 1, 1989, pp. 29&amp;ndash;31&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing such a role indirectly is even harder to verify than postulating double layers as accelerators of auroral electrons within the earth’s magnetosphere. Serious questions have been raised on their role even there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=D.A.,R.Bingham and U.deAngelis|title=Double layers are not particle accelerators|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=1992|volume=68|issue=1|pages=37–39|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.37|pmid=10045106|bibcode=1992PhRvL..68...37B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2565">The '''Dual-Stage 4-Grid''' (DS4G) is an [[electrostatic ion thruster]] design developed by the [[European Space Agency]],&lt;ref name=esaproject&gt;{{cite web|title=Dual-Stage Gridded Ion Thruster (DS4G) | publisher = ESA Advanced Concepts Team — Advanced Propulstion | url = http://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/ds4g_overview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with the [[Australian National University]].&lt;ref name=anuproject&gt;{{cite web | title=Dual stage 4 grid thruster | publisher = ANU Centre for Plasmas &amp;amp; Fluids | url = https://physics.anu.edu.au/cpf/sp3/ds4g/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was derived by D. Fern from Controlled Thermonuclear Reactor experiments that use a 4-grid mechanism to accelerate ion beams.

A 4-grid ion thruster with only 0.2 m diameter is projected to absorb 250&amp;nbsp;kW power. With that energy input rate, the thruster could produce a thrust of 2.5 [[Newton (unit)|N]]. The [[specific impulse]] (a measure of fuel efficiency), could reach 19,300 s at an exhaust velocity of 210&amp;nbsp;km/s if [[xenon]] propellant were used.&lt;ref name=esapaper&gt;[http://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/doc/PRO/ACT-RPR-PRO-IAC2006-DS4G-C4.4.7.pdf] THE INNOVATIVE DUAL-STAGE 4-GRID ION THRUSTER CONCEPT – THEORY AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS&lt;/ref&gt; The potentially attainable power and thrust densities would substantially extend the power absorption of current ion thrusters to far more than 100&amp;nbsp;kW. These characteristics facilitate the development of ion thrusters that can result in extraordinary high-end velocities.&lt;ref name=esapaper /&gt;

Like with thruster concepts such as [[VASIMR]], the dual-stage-4-grid ion thrusters are mainly limited by the necessary power supply for their operation. For example, if solar panels were to supply more than 250&amp;nbsp;kW, the size of the solar array would surpass the size of the solar panels of the [[International Space Station]]. To provide 250&amp;nbsp;kW with [[Stirling radioisotope generator]]s would require roughly 1&amp;nbsp;tonne of [[plutonium-238]] (for which the US stockpile as of 2013 was no more than 20&amp;nbsp;kg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosher|first=Dave|title=NASA’s Plutonium Problem Could End Deep-Space Exploration|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/09/plutonium-238-problem/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and so a nuclear thermal reactor would be needed.

'''Duroplast''' is a composite [[thermosetting plastic]], a close relative of [[Formica (plastic)|formica]] and [[bakelite]]. It is a [[resin]] [[plastic]] reinforced with fibers (either cotton or wool) making it a [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] similar to [[fiberglass]].

==Uses==
Duroplast was used by the [[German Democratic Republic]] state owned automobile manufacturer called [[HQM Sachsenring GmbH|VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau]] from 1955 to until 1991, just after [[German Reunification]]. It was the material used to produce the body of the [[Trabant]]. There were four main versions of the Trabant, the 1963-1990 [[Trabant 601]] was the longest running. The successor company is called [[HQM Sachsenring GmbH]].

The product was first used in the body of the [[Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau|IFA]] [[IFA F8|F8]] and later also the [[Zwickau (car)|AWZ]] P70 or Zwickau P70 and the Trabant. It was also used to make [[suitcase]]s.

==Properties==
Duroplast is light and strong. It is made of recycled material, [[cotton]] waste and [[phenol]] resins.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;  Because it can be made in a press similar to shaping steel, it is more suitable for volume car production than fiberglass.

==Disposal==
Similar to [[fiberglass]], Duroplast has limited possibilities for efficient disposal. As discarded Trabants began to fill junkyards, creative solutions sprung up for disposing of them. One of these was developed by a Berlin biotechnology company, which experimented with a bacterium to consume the body in 20 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kumar | first = Arvind | title = Environment Contamination &amp; Bioreclamation | page = 32 | publisher = APH Publishing | year = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FN8mifeULHcC&amp;pg=PA32 | isbn = 978-81-7648-587-6 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jalop1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/how-come-duroplast-didnt-become-a-thing-while-fiberglas-1681127100|title=How Come Duroplast Didn't Become A Thing While Fiberglass Went Big?|last=Petrány|first=Máté|date=13 February 2015|work=Jalopnik|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban legends, depicted in the movie ''[[Black Cat, White Cat]]'' and described in a song by the [[Serbia]]n band [[Atheist Rap]], described recycling Duroplast by feeding the cars to pigs, sheep and other farm animals. In the late 1990s, the same Trabant factory in Zwickau developed a solution for disposing of the Duroplast shells by shredding them and using them as an aggregate in cement blocks for pavement construction. This was featured in an episode of the program ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]'' on the American [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] TV channel.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{Scientific American Frontiers |4|2| url=https://www.pbs.org/saf/transcripts/transcript402.htm#4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public perception==
The use of Duroplast in Trabants and subsequent [[GDR jokes]] and mockery in western auto magazines such as ''[[Car and Driver]]'' gave rise to an [[urban myth]] that the Trabant is made of corrugated [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]].&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davis (2005) "[[Lemon (automobile)|Lemon]]!: Sixty Heroic Automotive Failures", {{ISBN|1-56025-757-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=koSFH2OKdJYC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=trabant+cardboard+-wikipedia&amp;lr=&amp;sig=6o_rb5dnWxmJgzzABUtz818IfdU#PPA156,M1 Chapter "Trabant P601, p.156-158]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''environmental impact of reservoirs''' comes under ever-increasing scrutiny as the global demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases.

[[Dam]]s and [[reservoir]]s can be used to supply [[drinking water]], generate [[hydroelectric power]], increase the water supply for [[irrigation]], provide recreational opportunities, and [[flood control]].  In 1960 the construction of [[Llyn Celyn]] and the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]] provoked political uproar which continues to this day. More recently, the construction of [[Three Gorges Dam]] and other similar projects throughout [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] have generated considerable environmental and political debate.

== Upstream impacts ==
[[File:Lake Nasser.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Nasser]] behind the [[Aswan dam]], Egypt, 5250 km², displaced 60,000 people&lt;ref name="Thayer"&gt;''A comparative survey of dam-induced resettlement in 50 cases'' by Thayer Scudder and John Gray [http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~tzs/50%20Dam%20Survey.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Fragmentation of river ecosystems ===
A dam also acts as a barrier between the upstream and downstream movement of migratory river animals, such as [[salmon]] and [[trout]].&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mann | first = Charles C |author2=Mark L. Plummer |date=August 2000 | title = Can Science Rescue Salmon? | journal = Science, New Series | volume = 289 | issue = 5480 | pages = 716–719 | pmid = | doi=10.1126/science.289.5480.716}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Some communities have also begun the practice of transporting migratory fish upstream to spawn via a barge.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

=== Reservoir sedimentation ===
Rivers carry sediment down their riverbeds, allowing for the formation of depositional features such as [[river delta]]s, [[alluvial fan]]s, [[braided river]]s, [[oxbow lake]]s, [[levees]] and [[shore|coastal shore]]s. The construction of a dam blocks the flow of sediment downstream, leading to downstream erosion of these sedimentary depositional environments, and increased sediment build-up in the reservoir. While the rate of sedimentation varies for each dam and each river, eventually all reservoirs develop a reduced water-storage capacity due to the exchange of "live storage" space for sediment.&lt;ref name="Silenced"&gt;''Silenced Rivers: The Ecology and Politics of Large Dams'', by Patrick McCully, Zed Books, London, 1996. {{ISBN|1-85649-902-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diminished storage capacity results in decreased ability to produce hydroelectric power, reduced availability of water for irrigation, and if left unaddressed, may ultimately result in the expiration of the dam and river.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;Reservoir Sedimentation Handbook; Morris, Gregory &amp; Fan, Jiahua; McGraw-Hill Publishers; 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact below dam ==

=== Riverline and coastal erosion ===
As all dams result in reduced sediment load downstream, a dammed river is greatly demanding for sediment as it will not have enough sediment. This is because the rate of deposition of sediment is greatly reduced since there is less to deposit but the rate of erosion remains nearly constant, the water flow erodes the river shores and riverbed, threatening shoreline ecosystems, deepening the riverbed, and narrowing the river over time. This leads to a compromised water table, reduced water levels, homogenization of the river flow and thus reduced ecosystem variability, reduced support for wildlife, and reduced amount of sediment reaching coastal plains and deltas.&lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt; This prompts coastal erosion, as beaches are unable to replenish what waves erode without the sediment deposition of supporting river systems. Downstream channel erosion of dammed rivers is related to the morphology of the riverbed, which is different from directly studying the amounts of sedimentation because it is subject to specific long term conditions for each river system. For example, the eroded channel could create a lower water table level in the affected area, impacting bottomland crops such as [[alfalfa]] or [[Zea mays|corn]], and resulting in a smaller supply.&lt;ref name="Egineering"&gt;Sedimentation Engineering; American Society of Civil Engineers Committee; American Society of Civil Engineers Headquarters; 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the case of the Three Gorges Dam in China the changes described above now appears to have arrived at a new balance of erosion and sedimentation over a 10-year period in the lower reaches of the river. The impacts on the tidal region have also been linked to the upstream effects of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impacts of large dams on downstream fluvial sedimentation: An example of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on the Changjiang (Yangtze River)|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216941201058X|journal = Journal of Hydrology|date = 2013-02-14|pages = 10–18|volume = 480|doi = 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.12.003|first = Zhijun|last = Dai|first2 = James T.|last2 = Liu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water temperature ===
The water of a deep reservoir in temperate climates typically stratifies with a large volume of cold, oxygen poor water in the hypolimnion. Analysis of temperature profiles from 11 large dams in the Murray Darling Basin (Australia) indicated differences between surface water and bottom water temperatures up to 16.7 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/emr.12074 | volume=15 | title=Review of cold water pollution in the Murray-Darling Basin and the impacts on fish communities | journal=Ecological Management &amp; Restoration | pages=71–79 | last1 = Lugg | first1 = Allan}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this water is released to maintain river flow, it can cause adverse impacts on the downstream ecosystem including fish populations. Under worse case conditions (such as when the reservoir is full or near full), the stored water is strongly stratified and large volumes of water are being released to the downstream river channel via bottom level outlets, depressed temperatures can be detected 250 - 350 kilometres downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/emr.12074 | volume=15 | title=Review of cold water pollution in the Murray-Darling Basin and the impacts on fish communities | journal=Ecological Management &amp; Restoration | pages=71–79 | last1 = Lugg | first1 = Allan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operators of Burrendong Dam on the Macquarie River (eastern Australia) are attempting to address thermal suppression by hanging a geotextile curtain around the existing outlet tower to force the selective release of surface water.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.statewater.com.au/current+projects/Environmental+projects/Burrendong+temperature+control+structure&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Natural ecosystems destroyed by agriculture===
Many dams are built for irrigation and although there is an existing dry ecosystem downstream, it is deliberately destroyed in favor of irrigated farming. After the [[Aswan Dam]] was constructed in Egypt it protected Egypt from the droughts in 1972–73 and 1983–87 that devastated East and West Africa. The dam allowed Egypt to reclaim about 840,000 hectares in the [[Nile Delta]] and along the Nile Valley, increasing [[Aswan Dam#Irrigation scheme|the country's irrigated area]] by a third. The increase was brought about both by irrigating what used to be desert and by bringing under cultivation 385,000 hectares that were natural flood retention basins. About half a million families were settled on these new lands.

=== Effects on flood-dependent ecology and agriculture ===
In many low lying developing countries the [[savanna]] and [[forest]] ecology adjacent to [[floodplain]]s and [[river delta]]s are irrigated by wet season annual floods. Farmers annually plant flood recession crops, where the land is cultivated after floods recede to take advantage of the moist soil. Dams generally discourage this cultivation and prevent annual flooding, creating a dryer downstream ecology while providing a constant water supply for irrigation.

''Case studies''
*The Lake Manatali reservoir formed by the [[Manantali dam]] in [[Mali]],  West Africa intersects the migration routes of nomadic [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]] and withholds water from the downstream savanna. The absence of the seasonal flood cycle causes [[Environmental impact of irrigation#Lost land use opportunities|depletion of grazing land]], and is also drying the forests on the floodplain downstream of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;A. deGeorges and B.K. Reilly, 2006. ''Dams and large scale irrigation on the Senegal river: impacts on man and the environment''. UNDP Human Development Report. On line: http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/degeorges_andre.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*After the construction of the [[Kainji Dam]] in [[Nigeria]], 50 to 70 percent of the downstream area of flood-recession cropping stopped.&lt;ref&gt;C.A.Drijver and M.Marchand, 1985. ''Taming the floods. Environmental aspects of the floodplain developments of Africa''. Centre of Environmental Studies, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential for disaster===
{{main|Dam failure}}
Dams occasionally break causing catastrophic damage to communities downstream. Dams break due to engineering errors, attack or natural disaster. The [[Banqiao Dam|greatest dam break disaster happened in China]] killing 200,000 Chinese citizens. However, they [[St. Francis Dam|have happened in California killing 600 people]], Germany during World War II and [[Dam failure#List of major dam failures|other countries]].

===Flood control===
The controversial [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China is able to store 22 cubic kilometres of floodwaters on the Yangtze River. The [[1954 Yangtze River floods]] killed 33,000 people and displaced 18 million people from their homes. In [[1998 China floods|1998 a flood]] killed 4000 people and 180 million people were affected. The flooding of the reservoir caused over a million people to relocate, then a flood in August 2009 was completely captured by the new reservoir, protecting hundreds of millions of people downstream.

== Effects beyond the reservoir ==

=== Effects on humans ===
'''Diseases'''&lt;br /&gt;
Whilst reservoirs are helpful to humans, they can also be harmful as well. One negative effect is  that the reservoirs can become breeding grounds for disease vectors. This holds true especially in tropical areas where [[mosquitoes]] (which are [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] for [[malaria]]) and [[snails]] (which are vectors for [[Schistosomiasis]]) can take advantage of this slow flowing water.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Jobin, 1999. ''Dams and Disease: Ecological Design and Health Impacts of Large Dams, Canals, and Irrigation Systems'', Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|0-419-22360-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0419223606&amp;id=NH6WcjShY2oC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;ots=TbZgPnlesk&amp;dq=%22Bakoy+River%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=ivNXJjX3GLZXNs6mZXEdNTHie6s]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:10.34748W 13.10430N.png|thumb|Lake Manantali, 477 km², displaced 12,000 people.]]

'''Resettlement'''&lt;br /&gt;
Dams and the creation of reservoirs also require relocation of potentially large human populations if they are constructed close to residential areas. The record for the largest population relocated belongs to the [[Three Gorges dam]] built in [[China]]. Its reservoir submerged a large area of land, forcing over a million people to relocate. "Dam related relocation affects society in three ways: an economic disaster, human trauma, and social catastrophe", states Dr. Michael Cernea of the [[World Bank]] and Dr. Thayer Scudder, a professor at the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="Thayer" /&gt; 
As well, as resettlement of communities, care must also be taken not to irreparably damage sites of historical or cultural value. The Aswan Dam forced the movement of the Temple at Aswan to prevent its destruction by the flooding of the reservoir.

=== Greenhouse gases ===
{{See also|Tapajós hydroelectric complex#Impact}}
Reservoirs may contribute to changes in the Earth's climate. Warm climate reservoirs generate [[methane]], a [[greenhouse gas]] when the reservoirs  are stratified, in which the bottom layers are [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] (i.e. they lack oxygen), leading to degradation of [[biomass]] through anaerobic processes.&lt;ref&gt;Climate Change and Dams: An Analysis of the Linkages Between the UNFCCC Legal Regime and Dams.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2014}} At a dam in Brazil, where the flooded basin is wide and the biomass volume is high the methane produced results in a pollution potential 3.5 times more than an oil-fired power plant would be.&lt;ref name="Dirty"&gt;Graham-Rowe, Duncan (2005). "[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046 Hydroelectric Power's Dirty Secret Revealed]", ''NewScientist.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical study has indicated that globally hydroelectric reservoirs may emit 104 million metric tonnes of methane gas annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11027-007-9086-5 | doi=10.1007/s11027-007-9086-5 | volume=13 | title=Methane Emissions from Large Dams as Renewable Energy Resources: A Developing Nation Perspective | journal=Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change | pages=193–206 | last1 = Lima | first1 = Ivan B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6977">'''[[Flathead motorcycles]]''' are a type of bike that was a standard for pre-war motorcycles, in particular US V-twins such as [[Harley-Davidson]] and [[Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company|Indian]], some British singles, [[History of BMW motorcycles|BMW]] [[flat twin]]s and Russian copies thereof.&lt;ref&gt;For example, some Dnepr and Ural used flathead designs that BMW had licensed to the Soviets.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flathead motorcycles have [[flathead engine|side-valve]] [[cylinder head]]s, an early engine design that has mostly fallen into disuse.&lt;ref&gt;However, flatheads  are currently experiencing a revival in low-revving [[aviation engine|aero-engines]]such as the [[D-Motor]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D-Motor image[http://lightningautogyro.com/gallery.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model W, singles, and 45s (DL, RL, and WL)===
The flathead engine saw service in Harley-Davidson motorcycles beginning with the [[Harley-Davidson Model W|Model W]]'s [[flat-twin engine|flat-twin]], produced from 1919 to 1923,&lt;ref name="ClassicHarley50_51"&gt;{{cite book| last1                  = Wagner| first1                = Herbert | last2               = Mitchell| first2              = Mark| title                 = Classic Harley-Davidson, 1903–1941| url                   = https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=hxDqgYbnBogC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| accessdate            = 2012-08-05| series                = Enthusiast Color|date=May 1999| publisher             = Motorbooks International| isbn                  = 0-7603-1805-0| pages                 = 46–47| chapter               = Chapter 6: The Gang's All Here| chapterurl            = https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=hxDqgYbnBogC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| quote                 = The Sport Model engine was Harley's first side-valve.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing in 1924 with single-cylinder export-model {{convert|21|cuin|cc|adj=on}} and {{convert|30.5|cuin|cc|adj=on}} singles and continued in [[Harley-Davidson Servi-Car|Servi-Car]]s until 1973. In the domestic U.S. market, the {{convert|45|cuin|cc|adj=on}} (primary VIN letter) D model (1929 to 1931) and its technical descendant, the (primary VIN letter) R model (1932 to 1936), started Harley's side-valve tradition in the 45-cubic-inch displacement class. The D and R models featured a [[total-loss oiling system]] and were succeeded in 1937 by the (primary VIN letter) W 45, which had recirculating oil lubrication. The WLA (W = return oil, L = performance, A = army) went on to serve in World War II as the U.S. and Canadian Army's WLC (C = Canada) primary two-wheeled mount and subsequently as a civilian middleweight through 1952. The engine continued virtually unchanged with 2.745" bore and 3.8125" stroke with various G-based designations in the three-wheeled [[Servi-Car]] until production ceased in 1973.

===K-series and developments===
In 1952, the K series flatheads was introduced with the same bore and stroke, selling in parallel with the W series (which was discontinued after 1952), designed to compete with British sporting motorcycles of the time. The K models featured a 750cc unit construction engine and transmission case, right side foot shift and left side foot brake.  From 1954 to 1956, the KH received an increase in stroke to 4-9/16" to bring displacement to 888cc (54 cubic inches). 
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=OSKRG |url=http://www.harleyKmodel.com/history/index.html | title=History of the Model K |accessdate=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The K series was replaced by the overhead valve Sportster series in the retail market in 1957. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://chessiesphotos.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/a-sweet-little-flathead-hd-style/| title=Flathead HD Style |accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The American Motorcycle Association (AMA) class C rules of 1952 allowed sidevalves of 750cc to compete against 500cc overhead valve bikes.  The 750cc KR factory racer was highly competitive in dirt track and road racing, and was produced in limited numbers until 1969
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=OSKRG | url=http://www.harleyKmodel.com/history/production-figures.html | title=K-model production figures, summarized from Harley-Davidson's The Legend Begins |accessdate=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
, when the AMA changed the rules by increasing the Class C displacement limit to 750 cc.  Without the displacement advantage, the KR flatheads were not competitive against 750 cc overhead valve bikes.

===Flathead big twins===
In 1930, the {{convert|74|cuin|cc|adj=on}} VL flathead replaced the JD Big Twin, which had featured [[IOE engine|intake-over-exhaust (IoE)]] valve configuration. The VL had a single downtube frame and total loss oiling, culminating in an {{convert|80|cuin|cc|adj=on}} version (VLH) in 1935. In 1937, that engine was redesigned to include a recirculating lubrication system, and designated the model U, and it went into the same frame and running gear configuration as the model E [[Harley-Davidson Knucklehead engine|Knucklehead]], which had originated in 1936. The U continued to be produced in varying configurations as a 74&amp;nbsp;cubic inch U &amp; UL (1937 to 1948), and 80&amp;nbsp;cubic inch UH &amp; ULH engine (1937 to 1941). By that time, the first year of the aluminum-head [[Harley-Davidson Panhead engine|Panhead]], it had been thoroughly superseded and outsold in the marketplace by the superior performance of the overhead valve model Big Twins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3103">The '''floating body effect''' is the effect of dependence of the body potential of a [[transistor]] realized by the [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI) technology on the history of its biasing and the [[carrier recombination]] processes. The transistor's body forms a capacitor against the insulated substrate. The charge accumulates on this capacitor and may cause adverse effects, for example, opening of parasitic transistors in the structure and causing off-state leakages, resulting in higher current consumption and in case of [[dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] in loss of information from the memory cells. It also causes the '''history effect''', the dependence of the [[threshold voltage]] of the transistor on its previous states. In analog devices, the floating body effect is known as the '''kink effect'''.

One countermeasure to floating body effect involves use of fully depleted devices. The insulator layer in FD devices is significantly thinner than the channel depletion width. The charge and thus also the body potential of the transistors is therefore fixed. &lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5388998 SOI technology for the GHz era], IBM Journal of Research and Development&lt;/ref&gt; However, the short-channel effect is worsened in the FD devices, the body may still charge up if both source and drain are high, and the architecture is unsuitable for some analog devices that require contact with the body. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20011126S0031 Intel does about-face on SOI, backs high-k dielectric], [[EE Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;Hybrid trench isolation is another approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eet.com/story/OEG20011217S0044 Mitsubishi SOI process uses hybrid trench isolation], EE Times&lt;/ref&gt;

While floating body effect presents a problem in SOI DRAM chips, it is exploited as the underlying principle for [[Z-RAM]] and [[T-RAM]] technologies. For this reason, the effect is sometimes called the '''Cinderella effect''' in the context of these technologies, because it transforms a disadvantage into an advantage.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://www.onversity.net/load/zram.pdf Z-RAM Shirnks Embedded Memory], [[Microprocessor Report]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[AMD]] and [[Hynix]] licensed Z-RAM, but as of 2008 had not put it into production.&lt;ref name="Intel explores"/&gt;
Another similar technology (and Z-RAM competitor) developed at Toshiba&lt;ref&gt;http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/memory/winner-masters-of-memory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1144452 Toshiba cuts capacitor from DRAM cell design]&lt;/ref&gt; and refined at Intel is [[Floating Body Cell]] (FBC).&lt;Ref&gt;http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1006279/intel-talks-up-floating-body-cells&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Intel explores"&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1168759 Intel explores floating-body cells on SOI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Web. 19 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative of the Government of Western Australia's [[Department for Planning and Infrastructure]] (DPI), was the responsibility of the public transport organisation [[Transperth]], though it was run by contracted operator [[Path Transit]]. They were operated in the city [[Perth]], the capital of [[Western Australia]]. These three buses are called "EcoBuses". The project ran from 2001-2005, with the first buses in service in September 2004.&lt;ref name=behling/&gt;

The Perth trial received [[Australian dollar|A$]]2.5 million funding from the [[Department of the Environment and Heritage (Australia)|Department of the Environment and Heritage]] and the [[Australian Greenhouse Office]].&lt;ref name=behling/&gt; It was endorsed by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] and the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]].&lt;ref name=behling/&gt;

BP produced the hydrogen as a by-product at its [[City of Kwinana|Kwinana]] [[oil refinery]] ({{Convert|50|km|mi|1}} south of Perth).&lt;ref name=behling/&gt; The hydrogen was then transported by road in specially designed road tankers to a bus depot in the northern suburbs of Perth.&lt;ref name=behling/&gt; Perth's buses achieved greater reliability and better [[fuel efficiency|fuel economy]] than in any other city in the trial.&lt;ref name=behling/&gt;

By June 2005, the Perth buses had covered more than {{Convert|60000|km|mi|0}} and completed almost 3,000 operational hours, with almost 60,000 passengers having used the service.&lt;ref name=behling/&gt;

* In 2004, STEP was achieved a [[Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]] Outstanding Achievement award.
* In 2005, it was presented with a [[Banksia Environmental Foundation|Banksia award]] in the "Government Leading by Example for a Sustainable Future" category.

== Partners ==
The buses were manufactured by [[DaimlerChrysler]], the manufacturer of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, and use [[fuel cell]] [[engine]]s manufactured by XCELLSIS Fuel Cell Engines, now a division of [[Ballard Power Systems]], developed as an alliance of Ballard, DaimlerChrysler, and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. A number of the cities are receiving their hydrogen from [[BP]]. The trial is being independently evaluated, mostly by [[Murdoch University]].

'''Google PowerMeter''' was a software project of [[Google]]'s philanthropic arm, [[Google.org]], to help consumers track their home [[electricity]] usage.&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;{{Cite news|author=Verne Kopytoff|author2=Ryan Kim|title=Google plans meter to detail home energy use|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/10/BULM15RHFH.DTL&amp;type=tech|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2009-02-22|accessdate=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the software was part of an effort by Google to invest in [[renewable energy]], [[electricity grid]] upgrades, and other measures that would reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. It was launched on October 5, 2009 and ended on September 16, 2011.&lt;ref name="discontinued"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/powermeter/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1340969 |title=Google PowerMeter - Save Energy.

The software was designed to record the user's electricity usage in near real-time. According to the company, if half of America's homes' energy use was cut by ten percent, it would equal the average energy used by eight million cars.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

It was hoped that this tool would raise the home-owner's awareness of how much energy they use and make users more energy efficient.&lt;ref name=sfgate /&gt; PowerMeter was intended for use with [[smart meter]]s able to track electricity usage in more detail than standard [[electricity meter|electric meters]]. According to Google, in 2009 there were approximately 40 million smart meters in use worldwide.&lt;ref name=sfgate /&gt; By early 2009, approximately 7% of US homes had a smart meter installed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

'''Growian''' or '''GROWIAN''' (short for German "'''Gro'''ße '''Wi'''ndenergie'''an'''lage" - "Large wind turbine") was a publicly funded [[wind turbine]] built in the [[Kaiser-Wilhelm-Koog]] near [[Marne (Holstein)|Marne]] for purposes of technology testing in the 1980s. It was a two-bladed "lee runner" (the rotor was situated on the downwind side of the tower) with a hub height of about {{convert|100|m|ft}}.

For a long time Growian was the world's largest wind turbine. Many features of the installation were novel and had not previously been trialled at this scale. Due to manufacturing faults in the casing, the turbine could not be run at full performance, and various issues with materials and construction prevented continuous testing. Consequently, the installation was idle for the greater part of the period between the first test run on 6 July 1983 (official start of operations was 4 October 1983&lt;ref name=dw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kalenderblatt.de/index.php?what=ged&amp;autorid=1813&amp;tag=4&amp;monat=10&amp;dayisset=1|title=4.10.1983: Windkraftanlage in Betrieb - KalenderBlatt zum 4. Oktober|website=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and end of operations in August 1987. Growian was decommissioned over the course of 1987, and dismantled in summer 1988.  

== Technical data ==
[[file:growian.jpg|thumb|left|GROWIAN with its two wind gauge pylons]]
Growian's power rating was 3,000 kW, at the time the highest in the world. The rotor had an oscillating nave, a diameter of {{convert|100.4|m|ft}}, and revolved at approximately 19.5 rpm. The orientation of the two blades was regulated by a mechanical-electrical mechanism. In contrast to most modern turbines, the blades rotated on the [[Windward and leeward|leeward]] side of the tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Jürgen Hauschildt|last1=Jörn Pulczynski|url=http://www.offshore-wind.de/page/fileadmin/offshore/documents/TU-Berlin_GroWiAn.pdf|chapter=Growian: Zielbildung für bedeutende Innovationsvorhaben|editor=Klaus Brockhoff|title=Management von Innovationen.

The turbine house at a height of {{convert|100|m|ft}} weighed 340 t, and each blade weighed 23 t.&lt;ref name="energieportal24"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jürgen|last=Brück|url=http://www.energieportal24.de/artikel_2574.htm|title=20 Jahre Windenergiepark Westküste|website=energieportal24|date=6 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turbine had a switching on speed of {{convert|5.4|m/s|ft/s}} and a rated speed of {{convert|12|m/s|ft/s}}. It would cut out at a speed of {{convert|24|m/s|ft/s}} and was rated for a maximum survivable speed of {{convert|60|m/s|ft/s}}. Projected annual energy yield at a mean wind speed of {{convert|9.3|m/s|ft/s}} was approximately 12 GWh.&lt;ref name=dat/&gt;

Rotor and [[induction generator]] were mechanically coupled by a gearing mechanism consisting of one [[Gear#Spur|spur gear]] and two [[Epicyclic gearing|epicyclic gear]]s. Feed-in to the power grid was realized using a set of [[motor–generator]]s that was largely identical to that later used at {{ill|Umspannwerk Neuhof|de}}, one of the few electrical substations that allowed for electricity import from the [[GDR]]. The rotors were constructed using steel walers, and in cross section consisted of a steel core, an outer skin and [[fibreglass]] reinforcement rods.&lt;ref name=dat/&gt; 

The tower and one of the rotors are on display at the [[Auto &amp; Technik Museum Sinsheim]].

The total cost of the installation was about 87 million [[Deutsche Mark]].&lt;ref name=heymann/&gt;

== Development and outcomes ==
[[file:Auto- und Technik Museum Sinsheim (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|Growian rotor blade with museum logo at [[Auto &amp; Technik Museum Sinsheim]]]]

Towards the end of 1976, the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (BMFT) decided to use research contracts and expert consultation to investigate the development of large wind turbines. This decision, taken as a result of public pressure, ran contrary to the stalling efforts of the major energy providers. Contracts were awarded to [[MAN SE]] , the Institute for Aerodynamics and Gas Dynamics at the [[University of Stuttgart]], and the [[University of Regensburg]]. In 1978 the BMFT decided to construct the world's largest wind turbine with a tower height and blade diameter of 100 m. MAN SE was chosen as main contractor, and the formation of a construction and operation company was given into the charge of the reluctant {{ill|Hamburgische Electricitäts-Werke|de}} (HEW). This led to the formation of the Growian [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] on 8 January 1980, of which HEW held 46.7%, {{ill|Schleswag|de}} held 30.1%, and [[RWE]] held 23.2%.&lt;ref name=heymann&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heymann|first1=Matthias|title=Die Geschichte der Windenergienutzung 1890–1990|publisher=Campus|location=Frankfurt am Main|year=1995|pages=369–382|ISBN=3-593-35278-8|language=German|chapter=7.3.3 - Das Growian-Projekt}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Overall and technical direction were the responsibility of HEW, while Schleswag dealt with commercial management. The basic contract between the partners of 3 January 1978 stipulated that after the project's conclusion, the installation was "anticipated to be dismantled and scrapped".

The partners as well as the BMFT also had political motives connected with the project. Günther Klätte, management board member of RWE, stated during a general business meeting: "We require Growian [&lt;i&gt;in the general sense of large wind turbines&lt;/i&gt;] as a proof of failure of concept", and he noted that "the Growian is a kind of pedagogical tool to convert the anti-nuclear energy crowd to the true faith".&lt;ref name=johansen&gt;{{cite news|first=Anatol|last=Johansen|title=Erfolg für das erste Aufwindkraftwerk der Welt|newspaper=Die Welt|volume=289|date=13 December 1982|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar statement regarding the incurred financial burdens was reported of Minister of Finance and former Minister of Research [[Hans Matthöfer]]: "We know it won't do anything for us. But we do it to demonstrate to the wind energy advocates that it doesn't work."&lt;ref name=johansen/&gt; After the Green Party had derided the installation as the electricity provider's "fig leaf" on the occasion of groundbreaking in May 1981, the RWE took internal measures to make sure that publicly a position of open-mindedness towards alternative energy production was emphasized while public interest in wind energy was allayed.   

Insuperable structural load and material problems occurred, not least due to the two-bladed lee runner configuration. The installation turned out to be a failure in most respects, spent substantially more time under repair than up and running, and was not even capable of sustained test operation. When it was decommissioned it had only logged a total of 420 hours in active operation.&lt;ref name=heymann/&gt;

Growian is regarded as one of the largest failures in the [[history of wind power]] and was unable to fulfill any of the expectations riding on its conception. What few insights were gained found little application in wind turbine construction. Some lessons were however learned from conceptional mistakes made in its construction, e.g., the futility of trying to reach profitable installation sizes without taking intermediate steps.&lt;ref name=heymann/&gt;

The point of view that multi-MW-yield wind turbines were technically and commercially infeasible gained some currency after the failure of the project, but was eventually superseded by technical progress. Beginning with the late 2000s, twenty-five years after Growian was decommissioned, installations with identical dimensions and yield (100 m rotor diameter, 3 MW net yield) were being produced in large numbers, a class of turbines that has continued to dominate the market and to push forward the mean net yield of newly installed turbines. As of 2015, substantially larger installations with yields up to 8 MW and rotor diameters of up to 170 m are present in the [[Offshore wind power|offshore sector]]. In contrast to Growian, however, these turbine types were incrementally developed from smaller installations in the 0.1 MW range. 

Growian's former locations is still being used for wind power generation. In 1988, Germany's first [[wind farm]], the {{ill|Windenergiepark Westküste|de}}, was built on a 20 hectare section of the former test area. It initially comprised 30 smaller turbines with net yields of 10-25 kW, provided by three different [[List of wind turbine manufacturers|wind turbine manufacturers]]. After being [[repowering|repowered]] twice, the wind farm today consists of four major installations with 1-2 MW yield, in addition to a test area for [[small wind turbine]]s and an information center presenting the history of wind power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windenergiepark-westkueste.de/|title=Windenergiepark Westküste}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''HVDC Russia–Finland''' (also: Kernovo-Mussalo cable) was a project to build a [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] [[submarine power cable]] between Kernovo, [[Leningrad Oblast]] ([[Russia]]) and Mussalo, [[Kotka]] ([[Finland]]). The main purpose of this project was to export Russian nuclear energy to [[Sweden]] and Finland.&lt;ref name=nordicum/&gt;

==History==
The cable has been suggested originally back in the 1990s by the Russian State Nuclear Power Company [[Rosenergoatom]]. In 2004, Finland based company United Power Oy, controlled by Baltenergo, a subsidiary of Rosenergoatom, submitted an official application for the submarine cable and a converter station.&lt;ref name=nordicum/&gt;  On 21 December 2005, a preliminary agreement of 15-years of electricity supply was signed between United Power and BasEl, representing 16&amp;nbsp;Swedish and Finnish companies.&lt;ref name=nordicum/&gt;&lt;ref name=basel&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2006, the Finnish Government rejected the project.&lt;ref name=hs201206&gt;
{{cite news

 | date = 2006-12-20
 | accessdate = 2007-06-30}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, United Power announced it will give up its effort to build an undersea electric cable from Russia to Finland and will look instead for direct link from Russia to Sweden across the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;

 | accessdate = 2007-06-30}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

After several years of efforts, the project was abandoned for political reasons. Politicians decided to drop support to this project in exchange to solve other bilateral issues, like the [[Nord Stream]], Russian export duties on timber, or the leasing of the [[Saimaa Canal]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In January 2008, United Power filed for insolvency at the Kotka district court.&lt;ref name=stt/&gt;

==Technical features==
The submarine cable was to have a capacity of 1,000&amp;nbsp;MW for the transmission of up to 8.7&amp;nbsp;TWh of electricity per year.&lt;ref name=basel/&gt; It was to consist of two ironclad cables at a distance of {{convert|50|to|100|m|ft}} from each other, and one ground metal cable.&lt;ref name=nordicum&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be linked with the [[Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant]] at [[Sosnovy Bor, Leningrad Oblast|Sosnovy Bor]].&lt;ref name=nordicum/&gt;

The overall cost of the project was estimated at €300&amp;nbsp;million. The financing agreement of the project was signed with Russia's state-run foreign economic bank [[Vnesheconombank]] (VEB) in June 2006.&lt;ref name=rian2&gt;

 | accessdate = 2009-02-08}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The pay-off period of the project was calculated to take six to nine years. The construction was to be completed in 2009–2010.&lt;ref name=nordicum/&gt;

==Route==
The main route proposal foresaw a cable from Kernovo in Russia to Mussalo in Finland.&lt;ref name=nordicum/&gt;&lt;ref name=basel/&gt; There were also alternative options. One possible option was to replace the 1000&amp;nbsp;MW cable with two 500&amp;nbsp;MW cables connecting Kernovo with different destinations in Finland. Other considered destinations in Finland were [[Loviisa]], [[Sipoo]], [[Espoo]] and [[Ingå]].&lt;ref name=nordicum/&gt;

After rejection by the Finnish authorities, United Power prepared to apply a new application for a cable with a lower capacity of up to 450&amp;nbsp;MW. It also considered an alternative route from [[Vyborg]] in Russia to [[Lappeenranta]] in Finland.&lt;ref name=yle2&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  United Power and Baltenergo also tried to proceed with alternative projects to export Russian electricity to Finland through Estonia, or directly from Russia to Sweden. In February 2007, Baltenergo suggested an undersea power cable from Sosnovy Bor to Estonia instead of Finland and to sell electricity to the Nordic market through Estonia.&lt;ref name=bns&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, United Power proposed a submarine cable from Russia directly to Sweden.&lt;ref name=mt&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was repeated by Baltenergo in May 2007.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; However, none of these proposals proceeded.

==United Power==
United Power Oy was a Finnish-Russian energy company established in 2003 as a special purpose company for transferring electricity from Russia to Finland and other European countries. The shareholders of United Power were Baltenergo, Kotkan Energia and a consortium of private investors.&lt;ref name=nordicum/&gt; Chairman of the Board was András Szép and Finnish members of the board were Jaakko Ihamuotila and Pertti Salolainen.&lt;ref name=hs200406/&gt;

==Controversy==
The project was backed by the Russian Government and supported by Finnish and Swedish industries.&lt;ref name=nordicum/&gt;&lt;ref name=hs130906&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the project was criticized by the Finnish national transmission grid operator [[Fingrid]] and also by some Russian energy companies. The [[FGC UES|Russian Federal Grid Company]] stated that there will not be enough electricity for export in the coming years as the [[Saint Petersburg]] area ([[Leningrad Oblast]]) is suffering from undercapacity, and the sea cable will worsen the current situation, as electricity would go abroad instead of to the Russian regions.&lt;ref name=nordicum/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbn1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Finnish concerns related to the Finnish grid ability to adapt the Russian power transmission and with the amount of necessary investments into transmission grid.

In [[thermodynamics]], the '''Helmholtz free energy''' is a [[thermodynamic potential]] that measures the useful [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] obtainable from a [[closed system|closed]] [[thermodynamic system]] at a constant [[temperature]] and [[volume]]. The negative of the change in the Helmholtz energy during a process is equal to the maximum amount of work that the system can perform in a thermodynamic process in which volume is held constant. If the volume were not held constant, part of this work would be performed as boundary work. This makes the Helmholtz energy useful for systems held at constant volume. Furthermore, at constant temperature, the Helmholtz energy is minimized at equilibrium.

In contrast, the [[Gibbs free energy]] or free enthalpy is most commonly used as a measure of thermodynamic potential (especially in [[chemistry]]) when it is inconvenient for applications that do not occur at constant pressure.  For example, in [[explosives]] research Helmholtz free energy is often used, since explosive reactions by their nature induce pressure changes. It is also frequently used to define fundamental [[equation of state|equations of state]] of pure substances.

The concept of free energy was developed by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], a German physician and physicist, and first presented in 1882 in a lecture called "On the thermodynamics of chemical processes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = von Helmholtz, H. | date = 1882 | title = Physical memoirs, selected and translated from foreign sources | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the German word ''Arbeit'' (work), the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) recommends the symbol ''A'' and the name ''Helmholtz energy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Gold Book | publisher = [[IUPAC]] | url = http://goldbook.iupac.org/H02772.html | accessdate = 2012-08-19 | doi=10.1351/goldbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physics]], the symbol ''F'' is also used in reference to ''free energy'' or ''Helmholtz function''.

==Definition==
The Helmholtz energy is defined as&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Ira. N. (1978). "''Physical Chemistry''" McGraw-Hill: University of Brooklyn.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A \equiv U- TS,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: ''A'' is the Helmholtz free energy ([[SI]]: [[joule]]s, [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS]]: [[erg]]s),
: ''U'' is the [[internal energy]] of the system (SI: joules, CGS: ergs),
: ''T'' is the absolute temperature ([[kelvin]]s) of the surroundings, modelled as a heat bath,
: ''S'' is the [[entropy]] of the system (SI: joules per kelvin, CGS: ergs per kelvin).

The Helmholtz energy is the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transformation]] of the internal energy ''U'', in which temperature replaces entropy as the independent variable.

==Formal development==
The [[first law of thermodynamics]] in a closed system provides
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q\ + \delta W,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy, &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the energy added as heat, and &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; is the work done on the system. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]] yields &lt;math&gt;\delta Q = T\,\mathrm{d}S&lt;/math&gt;. In case of a reversible change, the work done can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\delta W = -p\,\mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt; (ignoring electrical and other non-''PV'' work):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\,\mathrm{d}S - p\,\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the product rule for differentiation to d(''TS'') = ''T'' d''S'' + ''S'' d''T'', it follows
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \mathrm{d}(TS) - S\,\mathrm{d}T - p\,\mathrm{d}V,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}(U - TS) = -S\,\mathrm{d}T - p\,\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of ''A'' = ''U'' − ''TS'' enables to rewrite this as 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A = -S\,\mathrm{d}T - p\,\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

Because ''A'' is a thermodynamic [[Functions of state|function of state]], this [[fundamental thermodynamic relation|relation]] is also valid for a process (without electrical work or composition change) that is not reversible, as long as the system pressure and temperature are uniform.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = K. | year = 2014 | title = Expansion Work without the External Pressure, and Thermodynamics in Terms of Quasistatic Irreversible Processes | doi = 10.1021/ed3008704 | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 402–409 | bibcode = 2014JChEd..91..402S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimum free energy and maximum work principles==
The laws of thermodynamics are most easily applicable to systems undergoing reversible processes or processes that begin and end in thermal equilibrium, although irreversible quasistatic processes or spontaneous processes in systems with uniform temperature and pressure (u''PT'' processes) can also be analyzed&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr2014" /&gt; based on the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] as shown further below. First, if we wish to describe phenomena like chemical reactions, it may be convenient to consider suitably chosen initial and final states in which the system is in (metastable) thermal equilibrium. If the system is kept at fixed volume and is in contact with a heat bath at some constant temperature, then we can reason as follows.

Since the thermodynamical variables of the system are well defined in the initial state and the final state, the internal energy increase &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt;, the [[entropy]] increase &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt;, and the total amount of work that can be extracted, performed by the system, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, are well defined quantities. Conservation of energy implies

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U_\text{bath} + \Delta U + W = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The volume of the system is kept constant. This means that the volume of the heat bath does not change either, and we can conclude that the heat bath does not perform any work. This implies that the amount of heat that flows into the heat bath is given by

:&lt;math&gt;Q_\text{bath} = \Delta U_\text{bath} = -(\Delta U + W).&lt;/math&gt;

The heat bath remains in thermal equilibrium at temperature ''T'' no matter what the system does. Therefore, the entropy change of the heat bath is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_\text{bath} = \frac{Q_\text{bath}}{T} = -\frac{\Delta U + W}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

The total entropy change is thus given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_\text{bath} + \Delta S = -\frac{\Delta U - T\Delta S + W}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the system is in thermal equilibrium with the heat bath in the initial and the final states, ''T'' is also the temperature of the system in these states. The fact that the system's temperature does not change allows us to express the numerator as the free energy change of the system:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_\text{bath} + \Delta S = -\frac{\Delta A + W}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the total change in entropy must always be larger or equal to zero, we obtain the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;W \leq -\Delta A.&lt;/math&gt;

We see that the total amount of work that can be extracted in an isothermal process is limited by the free-energy decrease, and that increasing the free energy in a reversible process requires work to be done on the system. If no work is extracted from the system, then

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta A \leq 0,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus for a system kept at constant temperature and volume and not capable of performing electrical or other non-''PV'' work, the total free energy during a spontaneous change can only decrease.

This result seems to contradict the equation d''A'' = −''S'' d''T'' − ''P'' d''V'', as keeping ''T'' and ''V'' constant seems to imply d''A'' = 0, and hence ''A'' = constant. In reality there is no contradiction: In a simple one-component system, to which the validity of the equation d''A'' = −''S'' d''T'' − ''P'' d''V'' is restricted, no process can occur at constant ''T'' and ''V'', since there is a unique ''P''(''T'', ''V'') relation, and thus ''T'', ''V'', and ''P'' are all fixed. To allow for spontaneous processes at constant ''T'' and ''V'', one needs to enlarge the thermodynamical state space of the system. In case of a chemical reaction, one must allow for changes in the numbers ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; of particles of each type ''j''. The differential of the free energy then generalizes to

:&lt;math&gt;dA = -S\,dT - p\,dV + \sum_j \mu_j\,dN_j,&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;N_j&lt;/math&gt; are the numbers of particles of type ''j'', and the  &lt;math&gt;\mu_j&lt;/math&gt; are the corresponding [[chemical potential]]s. This equation is then again valid for both reversible and non-reversible u''PT''&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr2014" /&gt; changes. In case of a spontaneous change at constant ''T'' and ''V'' without electrical work, the last term will thus be negative.

In case there are other external parameters, the above [[fundamental thermodynamic relation|relation]] further generalizes to

:&lt;math&gt;dA = -S\,dT - \sum_i X_i\,dx_i + \sum_j \mu_j\,dN_j.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are the external variables, and the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding [[generalized forces]].

==Relation to the canonical partition function==
A system kept at constant volume, temperature, and particle number is described by the [[canonical ensemble]]. The probability to find the system in some energy eigenstate ''r'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;P_r = \frac{e^{-\beta E_r}}{Z},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\beta \equiv \frac{1}{k T},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_r = \text{energy of eigenstate }r,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \sum_r e^{-\beta E_r}.&lt;/math&gt;

''Z'' is called the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of the system. The fact that the system does not have a unique energy means that the various thermodynamical quantities must be defined as expectation values. In the thermodynamical limit of infinite system size, the relative fluctuations in these averages will go to zero.

The average internal energy of the system is the expectation value of the energy and can be expressed in terms of ''Z'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;U \equiv \langle E \rangle = \sum_r P_r E_r = -\frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial \beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the system is in state ''r'', then the generalized force corresponding to an external variable ''x'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;X_r = -\frac{\partial E_r}{\partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;

The thermal average of this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;X = \sum_r P_r X_r = \frac{1}{\beta} \frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that the system has one external variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Then changing the system's temperature parameter by &lt;math&gt;d\beta&lt;/math&gt; and the external variable by &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; will lead to a change in &lt;math&gt;\log Z&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;d(\log Z) = \frac{\partial\log Z}{\partial\beta}\,d\beta + \frac{\partial\log Z}{\partial x}\,dx = -U\,d\beta + \beta X\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

If we write &lt;math&gt;U\,d\beta&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;U\,d\beta = d(\beta U) - \beta\, dU,&lt;/math&gt;

we get

:&lt;math&gt;d(\log Z) = -d(\beta U) + \beta\, dU + \beta X \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the change in the internal energy is given by

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \frac{1}{\beta}\,d(\log Z + \beta U) - X\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

In the thermodynamic limit, the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] should hold:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T\, dS - X\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This then implies that the entropy of the system is given by

:&lt;math&gt;S = k\log Z + \frac{U}{T} + c,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is some constant. The value of ''c'' can be determined by considering the limit ''T'' → 0. In this limit the entropy becomes &lt;math&gt;S = k \log \Omega_0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the ground-state degeneracy. The partition function in this limit is &lt;math&gt;\Omega_0 e^{-\beta U_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt; is the ground-state energy. Thus, we see that &lt;math&gt;c = 0&lt;/math&gt; and that

:&lt;math&gt;A = -kT\log Z.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relating free energy to other variables ===

Combining the definition of Helmholtz free energy

:&lt;math&gt;A = U - T S&lt;/math&gt;

along with the fundamental thermodynamic relation

&lt;math&gt;dA = -S\,dT - P\,dV + \mu\,dN,&lt;/math&gt;

one can find expressions for entropy, pressure and chemical potential:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theory.physics.manchester.ac.uk/~judith/stat_therm/node70.html|title=4.3 Entropy, Helmholtz Free Energy and the Partition Function|website=theory.physics.manchester.ac.uk|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S = -\bigg( \frac{\partial A}{\partial T} \bigg) \bigg|_{V,N}, \quad
P = -\bigg( \frac{\partial A}{\partial V} \bigg) \bigg|_{T,N}, \quad
\mu = \bigg( \frac{\partial A}{\partial N} \bigg) \bigg|_{T,V}.&lt;/math&gt;

These three equations, along with the free energy in terms of the partition function,

:&lt;math&gt;A = -kT\log Z,&lt;/math&gt;

allow an efficient way of calculating thermodynamic variables of interest given the partition function and are often used in density of state calculations. One can also do [[Legendre transformation]]s for different systems.  For example, for a system with a magnetic field or potential, it is true that

:&lt;math&gt;m = -\bigg( \frac{\partial A}{\partial B} \bigg) \bigg|_{T,N}, \quad
V = \bigg ( \frac{\partial A}{\partial Q} \bigg) \bigg|_{N,T}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Bogoliubov inequality==
Computing the free energy is an intractable problem for all but the simplest models in statistical physics. A powerful approximation method is [[mean-field theory]], which is a variational method based on the Bogoliubov inequality. This inequality can be formulated as follows.

Suppose we replace the real Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of the model by a trial Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt;, which has different interactions and may depend on extra parameters that are not present in the original model. If we choose this trial Hamiltonian such that

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\tilde{H}\right\rangle = \langle H \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where both averages are taken with respect to the canonical distribution defined by the trial Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;A \leq \tilde{A},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the free energy of the original Hamiltonian, and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the free energy of the trial Hamiltonian. By including a large number of parameters in the trial Hamiltonian and minimizing the free energy, we can expect to get a close approximation to the exact free energy.

The Bogoliubov inequality is often formulated in a slightly different but equivalent way. If we write the Hamiltonian as

:&lt;math&gt;H = H_0 + \Delta H,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is exactly solvable, then we can apply the above inequality by defining

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{H} = H_0 + \langle\Delta H\rangle_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have defined &lt;math&gt;\langle X\rangle_0&lt;/math&gt; to be the average of ''X'' over the canonical ensemble defined by &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; defined this way differs from &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; by a constant, we have in general

:&lt;math&gt;\langle X\rangle_0 = \langle X\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\tilde{H}\right\rangle = \big\langle H_0 + \langle\Delta H\rangle \big\rangle = \langle H\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;A \leq \tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;

holds. The free energy &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the free energy of the model defined by &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; plus &lt;math&gt;\langle\Delta H\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. This means that

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{A} = \langle H_0\rangle_0 - T S_0 + \langle\Delta H\rangle_0 = \langle H\rangle_0 - T S_0,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus

:&lt;math&gt;A \leq \langle H\rangle_0 - T S_0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===

For a classical model we can prove the Bogoliubov inequality as follows. We denote the canonical probability distributions for the Hamiltonian and the trial Hamiltonian by &lt;math&gt;P_{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. From [[Gibbs' inequality]] we know that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(\tilde{P}_{r}\right)\geq \sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(P_{r}\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

holds. To see this, consider the difference between the left hand side and the right hand side. We can write this as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(\frac{\tilde{P}_{r}}{P_{r}}\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left(x\right)\geq 1 - \frac{1}{x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(\frac{\tilde{P}_{r}}{P_{r}}\right)\geq \sum_{r}\left(\tilde{P}_{r} - P_{r}\right) = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where in the last step we have used that both probability distributions are normalized to 1.

We can write the inequality as:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\log\left(\tilde{P}_{r}\right)\right\rangle\geq \left\langle\log\left(P_{r}\right)\right\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the averages are taken with respect to &lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}&lt;/math&gt;. If we now substitute in here the expressions for the probability distributions:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{r}=\frac{\exp\left[-\beta H\left(r\right)\right]}{Z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}=\frac{\exp\left[-\beta\tilde{H}\left(r\right)\right]}{\tilde{Z}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle -\beta \tilde{H} - \log\left(\tilde{Z}\right)\right\rangle\geq \left\langle -\beta H - \log\left(Z\right)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Since the averages of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; are, by assumption, identical we have:

:&lt;math&gt;A\leq\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have used that the partition functions are constants with respect to taking averages and that the free energy is proportional to minus the logarithm of the partition function.

We can easily generalize this proof to the case of quantum mechanical models. We denote the eigenstates of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\left|r\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. We denote the diagonal components of the density matrices for the canonical distributions for &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; in this basis as:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{r}=\left\langle r\left|\frac{\exp\left[-\beta H\right]}{Z}\right|r\right\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}=\left\langle r\left|\frac{\exp\left[-\beta\tilde{H}\right]}{\tilde{Z}}\right|r\right\rangle=\frac{\exp\left(-\beta\tilde{E}_{r}\right)}{\tilde{Z}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\tilde{E}_{r}&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt;

We assume again that the averages of H and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; in the canonical ensemble defined by &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; are the same:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\tilde{H}\right\rangle = \left\langle H\right\rangle \,&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle H\right\rangle = \sum_{r}\tilde{P}_{r}\left\langle r\left|H\right|r\right\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

The inequality

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(\tilde{P}_{r}\right)\geq \sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(P_{r}\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

still holds as both the &lt;math&gt;P_{r}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}&lt;/math&gt; sum to 1. On the l.h.s. we can replace:

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left(\tilde{P}_{r}\right)= -\beta \tilde{E}_{r} - \log\left(\tilde{Z}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

On the right-hand side we can use the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\exp\left(X\right)\right\rangle_{r}\geq\exp\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle_{r}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where we have introduced the notation

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle Y\right\rangle_{r}\equiv\left\langle r\left|Y\right|r\right\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

for the expectation value of the operator Y in the state r. [[Jensen's inequality#Statistical physics|See here]] for a proof. Taking the logarithm of this inequality gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left[\left\langle\exp\left(X\right)\right\rangle_{r}\right]\geq\left\langle X\right\rangle_{r}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This allows us to write:

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left(P_{r}\right)=\log\left[\left\langle\exp\left(-\beta H - \log\left(Z\right)\right)\right\rangle_{r}\right]\geq\left\langle -\beta H - \log\left(Z\right)\right\rangle_{r}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that the averages of H and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; are the same then leads to the same conclusion as in the classical case:

:&lt;math&gt;A\leq\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalized Helmholtz energy ==

In the more general case, the mechanical term (''p'' d''V'') must be replaced by the product of volume, [[Stress (physics)|stress]], and an infinitesimal strain:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the stress tensor, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the strain tensor. In the case of linear [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] materials that obey [[Hooke's law]], the stress is related to the strain by

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\varepsilon_{kl},&lt;/math&gt;

where we are now using [[Einstein notation]] for the tensors, in which repeated indices in a product are summed. We may integrate the expression for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the Helmholtz energy:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 A &amp;= \frac{1}{2}VC_{ijkl}\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{kl} - ST + \sum_i \mu_i N_i \\
   &amp;= \frac{1}{2}V\sigma_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij} - ST + \sum_i \mu_i N_i.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Application to fundamental equations of state ==

The Helmholtz free energy function for a pure substance (together with its partial derivatives) can be used to determine all other thermodynamic properties for the substance. See, for example, the equations of state for [[water]], as given by the [[IAPWS]] in their [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726024808/http://www.iapws.org/relguide/IAPWS95-Rev.pdf IAPWS-95] release.

The adsorption sites (heavy dots) are equivalent and can have unit occupancy. Also, the adsorbates are immobile on the surface.]]

The '''Langmuir adsorption model''' explains [[adsorption]] by assuming an [[adsorbate]] behaves as an ideal thing at [[isothermal process|isothermal]] conditions. At these conditions the [[adsorbate]]'s [[partial pressure]], &lt;math&gt;p_A&lt;/math&gt;, is related to the volume of it, {{mvar|V}}, adsorbed onto a solid [[adsorbent]]. The adsorbent, as indicated in the figure, is assumed to be an ideal solid surface composed of series of distinct sites capable of binding the adsorbate.  The adsorbate binding is treated as a chemical reaction between the adsorbate molecule &lt;math&gt;A_\text{g}&lt;/math&gt; and an empty site, {{mvar|S}}. This reaction yields an adsorbed complex &lt;math&gt;A_\text{ad}&lt;/math&gt; with an associated equilibrium constant &lt;math&gt;K_\text{eq}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;chem&gt; {A_{g}} + S &lt;=&gt; A_{ad}&lt;/chem&gt;

From these assumptions the Langmuir isotherm can be derived (see below), which states that it is good 

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_A = \frac{V}{V_\text{m}} = \frac{K_\text{eq}^A\,p_A}{1 + K_\text{eq}^A\,p_A},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta_A &lt;/math&gt; is the fractional occupancy of the adsorption sites, and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the monolayer.  A continuous monolayer of adsorbate molecules surrounding a homogeneous solid surface is the conceptual basis for this adsorption model.&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hanaor| first1=D.

==Background and experiments==
In 1916, [[Irving Langmuir]] presented his model for the adsorption of species onto simple surfaces.  Langmuir was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1932 for his work concerning surface chemistry.  He hypothesized that a given surface has a certain number of equivalent sites to which a species can “stick”, either by [[physisorption]] or [[chemisorption]].  His theory began when he postulated that gaseous molecules do not rebound elastically from a surface, but are held by it in a similar way to groups of molecules in solid bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langmuir|first=Irving|title=The Adsorption of Gases on Plane Surface of Glass, Mica and Platinum|journal=The Research Laboratory of The General Electric Company|date=June 1918|pages=1361–1402|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja02242a004|accessdate=11 June 2013|doi=10.1021/ja02242a004|volume=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Langmuir published two papers that proved the assumption that adsorbed films do not exceed one molecule in thickness.  The first experiment involved observing electron emission from heated filaments in gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langmuir|first=Irving|title=Part I|journal=The Research Laboratory of The General Electric Company|year=1916|pages=2221|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The second, a more direct proof, examined and measured the films of liquid on an adsorbent surface layer.  He also noted that generally the attractive strength between the surface and the first layer of adsorbed substance is much greater than the strength between the first and second layer.  However, there are instances where the subsequent layers may condense given the right combination of temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langmuir|first=Irving|title=Part II|journal=The Research Laboratory of The General Electric Company|year=1918|pages=1848|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic assumptions of the model==

Inherent within this model, the following assumptions&lt;ref name="Principles p. 240"&gt;{{cite book
  |author=Masel, Richard
  | title = Principles of Adsorption and Reaction on Solid Surfaces

# The surface containing the adsorbing sites is a perfectly flat plane with no corrugations (assume the surface is homogeneous) .
# The adsorbing gas adsorbs into an immobile state.
# All sites are equivalent.
# Each site can hold at most one molecule of A (mono-layer coverage only).
# There are no interactions between adsorbate molecules on adjacent sites.

==Derivations of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm==

===Kinetic derivation===
This section&lt;ref name="Principles p. 240"/&gt; provides a kinetic derivation for a single adsorbate case. The multiple adsorbate case is covered in the [[Langmuir adsorption model#Competitive Adsorption|Competitive adsorption]] sub-section.
The model assumes adsorption and [[desorption]] as being elementary processes, where the rate of adsorption ''r&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the rate of desorption ''r''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; are given by

:&lt;math&gt;r_\text{ad} = k_\text{ad} \, p_A \, [S],&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_\text{d} = k_d \, [A_\text{ad}],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the partial pressure of ''A'' over the surface, [''S''] is the concentration of bare sites in number/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, [''A''&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;] is the surface concentration of ''A'' in molecules/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; are constants of forward adsorption reaction and backward desorption reaction in the above reactions.

At equilibrium, the rate of adsorption equals the rate of desorption. Setting ''r''&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and rearranging, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {[A_\text{ad}]}{p_A[S]} =  \frac{k_\text{ad}}{k_\text{d}} = K_\text{eq}^A.&lt;/math&gt;

The concentration of sites is given by dividing the total number of sites (S_0) by the area of the adsorbate (a):

:&lt;math&gt;[S_0] = S_0/a.&lt;/math&gt;

We can then calculate the concentration of all sites by summing the concentration of free sites [''S''] and occupied sites:

:&lt;math&gt;[S_0] = [S] + [A_\text{ad}].&lt;/math&gt;

Combining this with the equilibrium equation, we get

:&lt;math&gt;[S_0] = \frac{[A_\text{ad}]}{K_\text{eq}^A\,p_A} + [A_\text{ad}] = \frac{1 + K_\text{eq}^A\,p_A}{K_\text{eq}^A\,p_A}\,[A_\text{ad}].&lt;/math&gt;

We define now the fraction of the surface sites covered with ''A'', θ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, as

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_A = \frac{[A_\text{ad}]}{[S_0]}.&lt;/math&gt;

This, applied to the previous equation that combined site balance and equilibrium, yields the Langmuir adsorption isotherm:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_A = \frac{K_\text{eq}^A\,p_A }{1 + K_\text{eq}^A\,p_A}.&lt;/math&gt;

Chem. | volume = 115 | issue = | page = 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1925. The [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of the finite number of adsorbents adsorbed on a surface, in a [[canonical ensemble]], is given by

:&lt;math&gt;Z(N_a) = \left[\zeta^{N_a}_L\frac{N_S!}{(N_S - N_a)!}\right]\frac{1}{N_a!},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\zeta_L&lt;/math&gt; is the partition function of a single adsorbed molecule, &lt;math&gt;N_S&lt;/math&gt; is the number of sites available for adsorption, and &lt;math&gt;N_a&lt;/math&gt; is the number of molecules adsorbed and should be less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;N_S&lt;/math&gt;. The terms in the bracket give the total partition function of the &lt;math&gt;N_a&lt;/math&gt; adsorbed molecules by taking a product of the individual partition functions (refer to [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)#Partition functions of subsystems|Partition function of subsystems]]). The &lt;math&gt;1/N_a!&lt;/math&gt; factor accounts for the overcounting arising due to the indistinguishable nature of the adsorption sites. The [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)#Grand canonical partition function|grand canonical partition function]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}(\mu_A) = \sum_{N_a=0}^{N_S} \exp\left(\frac{N_a\mu_A}{k_\text{B} T}\right) \frac{\zeta^{N_a}_L}{N_a!} \, \frac{N_S!}{(N_S - N_a)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt; is the chemical potential of adsorbed molecule. As it has the form of [[Binomial theorem|binomial series]], the summation is reduced to
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}(\mu_A) = (1 + x)^{N_S},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x = \zeta_L \exp\left(\frac{\mu_A}{k_\text{B} T}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The grand potential is

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega = -k_\text{B}T \ln(\mathcal{Z}) = -k_\text{B} T N_S \ln(1 + x),&lt;/math&gt;

based on which the average number of occupied sites is calculated

:&lt;math&gt; \langle N_a  \rangle = - \left(\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial \mu}\right)_{T, \text{area}},&lt;/math&gt;

which gives the coverage 
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_A = \frac{\langle N_a \rangle }{N_S} = \frac{x}{1 + x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now, invoking the condition that the system is in equilibrium, that is, the chemical potential of the adsorbed molecules is equal to that of the molecules in gas phase, we have
[[File:Surface coverage plot.gif|frame|An example plot of the surface coverage θ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''/(''P'' + ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) with respect to the partial pressure of the adsorbate. ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 100 mTorr. The graph shows levelling off of the surface coverage at pressures higher than ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.|493x493px]]

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_A = \mu_\text{g},&lt;/math&gt;

The chemical potential of an ideal gas is

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_\text{g} = \left( \frac{\partial A_\text{g}}{\partial N} \right)_{T,V} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; A_g = - k_B T \ln Z_g &lt;/math&gt; is the Helmholtz free energy of an ideal gas with its partition function

:&lt;math&gt;Z_g = \frac{q^N}{N!}. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; is the partition function of a single particle in the volume of &lt;math&gt;V &lt;/math&gt; (only consider the translational freedom here).

:&lt;math&gt;q=V \left(  \frac{2\pi m k_B T }{h^2}  \right)^{3/2}. &lt;/math&gt;

We thus have &lt;math&gt;\mu_g = -k_B T \ln  (q/N)&lt;/math&gt;.

Plugging &lt;math&gt;\mu_g&lt;/math&gt; to the expression of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\theta_A}{1 - \theta_A} = x =  \zeta_L \frac{N}{q}  &lt;/math&gt;

which gives the coverage

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_A  = \frac{\zeta_L/(q/N)}{1+\zeta_L/(q/N)}&lt;/math&gt;

By defining

:&lt;math&gt;P_0 = \frac{k_\text{B}T}{\zeta_L} \left( \frac {2 \pi m k_\text{B} T}{h^2} \right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;

and using the identity &lt;math&gt;PV=N k_B T&lt;/math&gt;, finally, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \theta_A = \frac {P}{P + P_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is plotted in the figure alongside demonstrating that the surface coverage increases quite rapidly with the partial pressure of the adsorbants, but levels off after ''P'' reaches ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Competitive adsorption===

The previous derivations assumes that there is only one species, ''A'', adsorbing onto the surface. This section&lt;ref name="Principles p. 244"&gt;{{cite book
  | author = Masel, Richard
  | title = Principles of Adsorption and Reaction on Solid Surfaces
  | publisher = Wiley Interscience
  | year = 1996
  | location = 
  | pages = 244
  | isbn = 0-471-30392-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; considers the case when there are two distinct adsorbates present in the system. Consider two species ''A'' and ''B'' that compete for the same adsorption sites. The following assumptions are applied here:
# All the sites are equivalent.
# Each site can hold at most one molecule of ''A'' or one molecule of ''B'', but ''not both''.
# There are no interactions between adsorbate molecules on adjacent sites.

As derived using kinetical considerations, the equilibrium constants for both ''A'' and ''B'' are given by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{[A_\text{ad}]}{p_A\,[S]} = K^A_\text{eq} &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{[B_\text{ad}]}{p_B\,[S]} = K^B_\text{eq}. &lt;/math&gt;

The site balance states that the concentration of total sites [''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;] is equal to the sum of free sites, sites occupied by ''A'' and sites occupied by ''B'':

:&lt;math&gt;[S_0] = [S] + [A_\text{ad}] + [B_\text{ad}].&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting the equilibrium equations and rearranging in the same way we did for the single-species adsorption, we get similar expressions for both θ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; and θ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_A = \frac{K^A_\text{eq}\,p_A}{1 + K^A_\text{eq}\,p_A + K^B_\text{eq}\,p_B},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_B = \frac{K^B_\text{eq}\,p_B}{1 + K^A_\text{eq}\,p_A + K^B_\text{eq}\,p_B}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Dissociative adsorption===

The other case of special importance is when a molecule ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociates into two atoms upon adsorption.&lt;ref name="Principles p. 244"/&gt; Here, the following assumptions would be held to be valid:
# ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; completely dissociates to two molecules of ''D'' upon adsorption.
# The ''D'' atoms adsorb onto distinct sites on the surface of the solid and then move around and equilibrate.
# All sites are equivalent.
# Each site can hold at most one atom of ''D''.
# There are no interactions between adsorbate molecules on adjacent sites.

Using similar kinetic considerations, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{[D_\text{ad}]}{p^{1/2}_{D_2}[S]} = K^D_\text{eq}.&lt;/math&gt;

The 1/2 exponent on ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; arises because one gas phase molecule produces two adsorbed species. Applying the site balance as done above,

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_D = \frac{(K^D_\text{eq}\,p_{D_2})^{1/2}}{1 + (K^D_\text{eq}\,p_{D_2})^{1/2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Entropic considerations==
The formation of Langmuir monolayers by adsorption onto a surface dramatically reduces the entropy of the molecular system. This conflicts with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy will increase in an isolated system. This implies that either another locally active force is stronger than the thermodynamic potential, or that our expression of the entropy of the system is incomplete.

To find the entropy decrease, we find the entropy of the molecule when in the adsorbed condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

:&lt;math&gt;S_\text{conf} = k_B \ln \Omega_\text{conf},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega_\text{conf} = \frac{N_S!}{N! (N_S - N)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Stirling's approximation]], we have
: &lt;math&gt;\ln N! \approx N \ln N - N,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; S_\text{conf} / k_B \approx -\theta_A \ln(\theta_A) - (1 - \theta_A) \ln(1 - \theta_A).&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, the entropy of a molecule of an ideal gas is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {S_\text{gas}}{N k_\text{B}} = \ln\left( \frac{k_\text{B} T}{P \lambda^3} \right) + 5/2,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]] of the gas molecule.

==Disadvantages of the model==

The Langmuir adsorption model deviates significantly in many cases, primarily because it fails to account for the surface roughness of the adsorbent. Rough inhomogeneous surfaces have multiple site-types available for adsorption, with some parameters varying from site to site, such as the heat of adsorption. Moreover, specific surface area is a scale dependent quantity and no single true value exists for this parameter.&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt; Thus, the use of alternative probe molecules will often result in different obtained numerical values for surface area, rendering comparison problematic.

The model also ignores adsorbate/adsorbate interactions. Experimentally, there is clear evidence for adsorbate/adsorbate interactions in heat of adsorption data.  There are two kinds of adsorbate/adsorbate interactions: direct interaction and indirect interaction. Direct interactions are between adjacent adsorbed molecules, which could make adsorbing near another adsorbate molecule more or less favorable and greatly affects high-coverage behavior.  In indirect interactions, the adsorbate changes the surface around the adsorbed site, which in turn affects the adsorption of other adsorbate molecules nearby.

==Modifications==

The modifications try to account for the points mentioned in above section like surface roughness, inhomogeneity, and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions.

===Freundlich adsorption isotherm===
{{main|Freundlich equation}}
The Freundlich isotherm is the most important multisite adsorption isotherm for rough surfaces.

:&lt;math&gt; \theta_A = \alpha_F\,p^{C_F}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''C&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' are fitting parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Freundlich|first1 = H.|journal = Kapillarchemie|date = 1909|publisher = Academishe Bibliotek|location = Leipzig|title = eine darstellung der chemie der kolloide und verwanter gebiete.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This equation implies that if one makes a log-log plot of adsorption data, the data will fit a straight line. The Freundlich isotherm has two parameters while Langmuir's equations has only one: as a result, it often fits the data on rough surfaces better than the Langmuir's equations.

A related equation is the ''Toth equation''. Rearranging the Langmuir equation, one can obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_A = \frac{p_A}{\frac{1}{K_{eq}^A} + p_A}&lt;/math&gt;

Toth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toth | first1 = J | year = 1971 | title = State equations of the solid gas interface layer | journal = Acta Chim. Acad. Sci. Hung. | volume = 69 | issue = | page = 311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; modified this equation by adding two parameters, ''α&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''C&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' to formulate the '''Toth equation''':

:&lt;math&gt;\theta^{C_{T_0}} = \frac {\alpha_{T_0}\,p_A^{C_{T_0}}}{\frac{1}{K_{eq}^A} + p_A^{C_{T_0}}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Temkin adsorption isotherm===
This isotherm takes into accounts of indirect adsorbent-adsorbate interactions on adsorption isotherms. Temkin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Temkin|first1=M. I.|last2=Pyzhev|first2=V.|journal=Acta Physicochima USSR|date=1940|volume=12|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted experimentally that heats of adsorption would more often decrease than increase with increasing coverage.

The heat of adsorption ''ΔH&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{[A_{ad}]}{p_A\,[S]} = K^A_{eq} \propto \mathrm{e}^{-\Delta G_{ad}/RT} = \mathrm{e}^{\Delta S_{ad}/R}\,\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta H_{ad}/RT}&lt;/math&gt;

He derived a model assuming that as the surface is loaded up with adsorbate, the heat of adsorption of all the molecules in the layer would decrease linearly with coverage due to adsorbent/adsorbate interactions:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H_{ad} = \Delta H^0_{ad}\,(1-\alpha_T\,\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a fitting parameter. Assuming the Langmuir Adsorption isotherm still applied to the adsorbed layer, &lt;math&gt;K_{eq}^A &lt;/math&gt; is expected to vary with coverage, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;K^A_{eq} = K^{A,0}_{eq} \mathrm{e}^{(\Delta H^0_{ad}\,(1-\alpha_T\,\theta)/ k\,T)}&lt;/math&gt;

Langmuir's isotherm can be rearranged to this form:

:&lt;math&gt;K^A_{eq}\,p_A = \frac{\theta }{1-\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the expression of the equilibrium constant and taking the natural logarithm:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln (K^{A,0}_{eq}\,p_A) = \frac{-\Delta H^0_{ad} \, \alpha_T \, \theta}{k\,T} + \ln \left( \frac{\theta}{1-\theta}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===BET equation===
{{main|BET theory}}
[[Image:BET Multilayer Adsorption.svg|thumb|450px|right|Brunauer's model of multilayer adsorption, that is, a random distribution of sites covered by one, two, three, etc., adsorbate molecules.]]
Brunauer, Emmett and Teller&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/ja01269a023| issn = 0002-7863| volume = 60| issue = 2| pages = 309–319| last1 = Brunauer| first1 = Stephen| last2 = Emmett| first2 = P. H.| last3 = Teller| first3 = Edward| title = Adsorption of Gases in Multimolecular Layers| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| date = 1938| url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja01269a023}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived the first isotherm for multilayer adsorption. It assumes a random distribution of sites that are empty or that are covered with by one monolayer, two layers and so on, as illustrated alongside. The main equation of this model is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{[A]}{S_0} = \frac{c_B \, x_B}{(1-x_B)\,[1 + (c_B - 1)\,x_B]}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;x_B = p_A\,K_m, \qquad c_B = \frac{K_1}{K_m}&lt;/math&gt;

and ''[A]'' is the total concentration of molecules on the surface, given by:

:&lt;math&gt;[A] = \sum^{\infty}_{i=1} i\,[A]_i = \sum^{\infty}_{i=1}i \, K_1 \, K^{i-1}_m \, p^i_A \, [A]_0&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;K_i = \frac{[A]_i}{p_A\,[A]_{i-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

in which ''[A]&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of bare sites, and ''[A]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of surface sites covered by ''i'' molecules.

== Adsorption of a binary liquid on a solid ==
{{Main| Surface excess isotherm}}
This section describes the surface coverage when the adsorbate is in liquid phase and is a binary mixture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Marczewski 
  | first = A. W

  | doi = 
  | accessdate = 2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ideal both phases - no lateral interactions, homogeneous surface - the composition of a surface phase for a binary liquid system in contact with solid surface is given by a classic [[Everett isotherm]] equation (being a simple analogue of Langmuir equation), where the components are interchangeable (i.e. "1" may be exchanged to "2") without change of eq. form:

::&lt;math&gt;x_1^s \, = \, \frac{Kx_1^l}{1+(K-1)x_1^l}&lt;/math&gt;

where the normal definition of multicomponent system is valid as follows :&lt;br /&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{k} x^s_i =1 \,\,\sum_{i=1}^{k} x^l_i =1 &lt;/math&gt;
By simple rearrangement, we get &lt;br /&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;x_1^s \, = \, \frac{K[x_1^l/(1-x_1^l)]}{1+K[x_1^l/(1-x_1^l)]}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation describes competition of components "1" and "2".

'''Live steam''' is [[steam]] under pressure, obtained by heating water in a [[boiler]]. The steam is used to operate stationary or moving equipment.

A live steam machine or device is one powered by steam, but the term is usually reserved for those that are [[replica]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[toy]]s, or otherwise used for [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], museum, entertainment, or recreational purposes, to distinguish them from similar devices powered by electricity or some other more convenient method but designed to look as if they are steam-powered. [[Revenue]]-earning steam-powered machines such as mainline and [[narrow gauge]] [[steam locomotives]], [[steamship]]s, and power-generating [[steam turbine]]s are not normally referred to as "live steam".

[[Steamroller]]s and [[traction engine]]s are popular, in 1:4 or 1:3 scale, as are model [[stationary steam engine]]s, ranging from pocket-size to 1:2 scale.

[[Image:Lsfestival.jpg|thumb|250px|A Live Steam Festival displaying equipment ranging from small stationary engines to full-size locomotives. [[Porvoo]], [[Finland]], 2003]]

== Railroads or Railways ==

Ridable, large-scale live steam railroading on a [[backyard railroad]] is a popular aspect of the live steam hobby, but it is time-consuming to build a locomotive from scratch and it can be costly to purchase one already built.  [[Garden railway]]s, in smaller scales (that cannot pull a "live" person nor be ridden on), offer the benefits of real steam engines (and at lower cost and in less space), but do not provide the same experience as operating one's own locomotive in the larger scales and riding on (or behind) it, while doing so.

One of the most famous live steam railroads was [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Carolwood Pacific Railroad]] around his California home; it later inspired Walt Disney to surround his planned [[Disneyland]] [[amusement park]] with a working, [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] railroad.

[[Image:Livesteamtrain.jpg|250px|thumb|A propane fired 1:8 scale live steam train running on the [[Finnish Railway Museum]]'s miniature {{RailGauge|7.25in}} track.]]

The live steam hobby is especially popular in the UK, US, and Australia. All over the world, there are hundreds of clubs and associations as well as many thousands of private backyard railroads. The world's largest live steam layout, with over {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} of {{RailGauge|7.5in}} trackage is ''[[Train Mountain Railroad]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TMRR |url=http://trainmountain.org/ |title='&amp;#39;Train Mountain'&amp;#39; website |publisher=Trainmountain.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chiloquin]], [[Oregon]]. Other notable layouts are operated by the [[Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum]] and the Riverside Live Steamers.

Although not technically live steam, the hobby embraces other scale model locomotives
whose prototypes are diesel (gasoline) and electric (battery).  A few tracks restrict operation to only
live steam engines, such as the Riverside Live Steamers mentioned above, but a visit to most
tracks will reveal a mixture of locomotive types.

===Scale===
A live steam locomotive is often an exact, hand-crafted [[scale model]].  Live steam railroad scales are generally referred to by the number of inches of scale per foot.  For example, a 1:8 scale locomotive will often be referred to as a 1½" scale locomotive.  Common [[Rail transport modelling scales|modelling scales]] are [[Gauge 1]] ([[1:32 scale]]), 1/2" ([[1:24 scale]]), 3/4" (1:16), 1" (1:12), 1½" (1:8), 2½" (~1:5) and 3" (1:4).

===Track gauge===
[[Track gauge]] refers to the distance between the rails. The ridable track gauges range from {{RailGauge|2.5in}} to {{RailGauge|15in}}, the most popular being {{frac|3|1|2}}", {{frac|4|3|4}}", 5", {{frac|7|1|4}}" and {{frac|7|1|2}}" (see [[Rail transport modelling scales]]). Gauges from {{RailGauge|10in}} and up are called "[[Miniature Railways]]" (in the US these are known as "[[Grand Scale]] Railroads"), and are used mostly in amusement park rides and commercial settings.

Often the gauge has little to do with the scale of a [[locomotive]] since larger equipment can be built in a [[narrow gauge railway]] configuration. For instance, scales of 1.5, 1.6, 2.5, and 3&amp;nbsp;inches per foot (corresponding to scales of 1:8 to 1:4) have been used on a {{RailGauge|7.5in}} track gauge.

The generally accepted smallest gauge for a live steam locomotive is {{RailGauge|45mm}} [[Gauge 1]], although [[O scale]] live steam models are also common. Producing smaller-scale models remains problematic, as the laws of physics do not themselves scale: creating a small-scale boiler that produces useful quantities of steam requires careful engineering. [[Hornby Railways]] has produced commercial live steam-powered locomotives in [[OO scale]] by utilising an electrically heated boiler mounted in the tender, with cylinders in the locomotive, and control provided by electrical- signals fed through the track from a remote control unit. They are less mechanically realistic than models in larger scales; the visible valve gear is a dummy, as on the electric-motor-powered models, and steam admission to the cylinders is controlled by a rotary-valve [[Servomechanism|servo]] inside the boiler casing, which is also a dummy. Nevertheless, the locomotive is driven by steam that is created on board the locomotive and is hence a genuine ''steam'' locomotive.

It is technically possible to build even smaller operating steam engines. Hand-made examples, as small as [[Z scale]] (1:220), with a gauge of only {{RailGauge|6.5mm}}, have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesteam.net |title=Live Steam magazine |publisher=Livesteam.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are fired with a [[butane]] flame from a burner in the engine's [[Tender (railroad car)|tender]]. AA Sherwood of Australia, an engineering lecturer, produced some miniature scale model live steam engines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. His smallest live steam engines were 1:240 scale which is smaller than the 1:220 of Z Scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest scale Sherwood worked in was 1:480, though that was not live steam.

===Technology===

[[File:Working principle of steam locomotive model.gif|frameless|right|320px]]&lt;!--'thumb' used as original image has inconsistent border (right edge missing), otherwise 'frameless' could be used--&gt;

A wide variety of boiler designs are available, ranging from simple externally fired [[pot boiler]]s to sophisticated [[fire-tube boiler|multi-flue internally fired boilers]] and even [[superheater]] boilers usually found only on larger, more complex models.

For basic locomotive models, a simple [[valve gear]] can be used, with the reversing (if any) performed by a [[valve]], or by using a "slip" [[eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]].

More complex locomotive models can use valve gear similar to real steam machine with the reversing done mechanically, most frequently the [[Walschaerts valve gear|Walschaerts]] type.

===Fuels===

There are several common fuels used to boil water in live steam models:

* [[Hexamine fuel tablet]]s – which produce relatively little heat but are cheap and relatively safe. They are often used on "toy" live steam locomotives and engines, such as the newer models in the range produced by [[Mamod]].
* [[Methylated spirit]], (methanol/ethanol mixture) – which burns hotter than solid fuel, but, as with any flammable liquid, requires more careful handling. Cheap and easy to obtain, this fuel was used with early Mamod models.
* [[Butane]] gas – clean burning and safe, but relatively expensive to engineer the burners.
* [[Electricity]] – delivered via the track and used to boil the water with an [[immersion heater]]. In 2003, [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]] launched a range of [[00 gauge]] models that run from a 10 to 17 Volt power supply, making this method safer than previous, higher voltage versions.
* [[Coal]] – which is the prototypical fuel for most full-sized steam locomotives, and the preferred fuel for ridable trains. It can also be used on boilers down to at least [[16 mm scale|16mm:1 foot scale]].
* [[Oil]] – also a popular fuel for large, ridable trains.
* [[Propane]] gas – an alternative to coal or oil in large-scale models. Propane has also been used successfully as fuel in smaller 1:48 scale live steam locomotives produced most notably by Roland Neff.

== Road vehicles ==
Live steam road vehicles are popular with model engineers because they are not restricted to running on tracks or water and can be easily transported for rallies and exhibitions. They include [[traction engine]]s &amp; [[steam roller|roller]]s, [[steam wagon|wagon]]s, [[steam car|car]]s, road-making &amp; agricultural machines, often seen with ancillary equipment like [[threshing machines]].

== Boats and ships ==

Most types of [[boat]]s and [[ship]]s that were powered by steam in real life can be found as live steam [[ship model]]s. These include, amongst others, [[speed boat]]s, [[Launch (boat)|launches]], [[tugboat]]s, [[ocean liner]]s, [[warship]]s, [[paddle steamer]]s and [[Cargo ship|freight carriers]]. A specialized type is the tethered [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpba.org.uk/Section_pages/tethered_hydroplane.html |title=Tethered Hydroplanes |publisher=Mpba.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When steam-powered, these often have [[flash boiler]]s.

== Stationary engines ==

Stationary engines tend to be less popular with modelers than mobile engines; probably because they are less easily transportable. They are more popular with toy makers. They can be anything from small farm engines to [[winding engine]]s and [[mill engine]]s.

== Toys ==

In the late 19th and early-mid 20th centuries, live steam toys were extremely popular, with some large manufacturers like [[Bing (company)|Bing]] selling hundreds of different models in large quantities. There were very many smaller manufacturers all over the world. Some of these, like [[Mamod]], [[Wilesco]] and [[Jensen Steam Engines|Jensen]], are still in business making live steam toys, although they are now mainly marketed as collectables and novelties rather than toys. Toys tend to be less accurate representations of real life equipment than are models and many are somewhat generic in nature. The range includes all those seen as models and some of a purely novelty kind.

== Festivals ==
[[Image:LSmagazine.jpg|thumb|right|Sept/Oct 2005 issue of Live Steam magazine]]
A '''live steam festival''' (often called a "Steam Fair" in the UK and a live steam "meet" in the US) is a gathering of people interested in steam technology. Locomotives, trains, [[traction engine]]s, [[steam roller]]s and [[steam tractor|tractors]], [[steam boat]]s and [[steam car|cars]], and [[stationary steam engine]]s may be on display, both full-sized and in miniature. Rides may also be offered.

== Publications ==

There are several magazines devoted to the live steam hobby:

"[[Model Engineer]]" is an English publication that is published twice a month and was founded in 1898.  Most locomotive articles have an "English" flavour popular in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The magazine is aimed at constructors but also covers non-steam and non-rail [[model engineering]] interests.

"[[Live Steam &amp; Outdoor Railroading (magazine)|Live Steam &amp; Outdoor Railroading]]" is a U.S. magazine, founded in 1966 and devoted to the live steam hobby, as well as to other uses of miniature and full-size steam. Originally, it was a [[mimeograph]]ed [[newsletter]], but soon expanded into magazine format. In 2005, the name was changed from "Live Steam". It is currently published bi-monthly, with a [[press run]] of slightly over 10,000 (Dec. 2004).

A more recent publication, launched in 2006, is "The Home Railway Journal",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homerailwayjournal.com/index.html |title=The Home Railway Journal |publisher=The Home Railway Journal |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is specifically aimed at enthusiasts with ride-on railways (although not just steam-powered) in North America. It is published quarterly in Sacramento, California, US.

'''Mahindra Electric Mobility Limited''', formerly known as the '''Reva Electric Car Company''', is an [[India]]n company based in [[Bangalore]], involved in designing and manufacturing of compact [[electric vehicle]]s. The company's first vehicle was the [[REVAi]] [[electric car]], available in 26 countries with more than 4,000 of its different versions sold worldwide by mid March 2011.&lt;ref name=REVAsales/&gt;&lt;ref name=REVAcountries/&gt; Reva was acquired by Indian conglomerate [[Mahindra &amp; Mahindra]] in May 2010. After the acquisition, the company launched the electric hatchback e2o in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mahindra launches electric car, e2o|url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/Mahindra-launches-electric-car-e2o/article12389948.ece|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the company sells electric vehicles in different segments – the electric CitySmart hatchback e2oPlus, the electric sedan eVerito and electric commercial vehicle eSupro (passenger and cargo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahindra Electric - Products|url=http://www.mahindraelectric.com/mahindraelectric/products/|website=Mahindra Electric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Reva Electric Car Company (RECC) was founded in 1994 by [[Chetan Maini]], as a joint venture between the Maini Group of Bangalore and Amerigon Electric Vehicle Technologies (AEVT Inc.) of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revaindia.com/about.htm|title=About us|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010107205400/http://www.revaindia.com/about.htm|archivedate=7 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's sole aim was to develop and produce an affordable compact electric car. Several other automakers were also aiming to do so, but in 2001 RECC launched the [[REVAi|REVA]].

REVA was an acronym for "Revolutionary Electric Vehicle Alternative".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/05-15-2001/0001493979&amp;EDATE= Exide Technologies to Supply Batteries to REVA Electric Vehicle Project; Company Signs Agreement as Sole Battery Supplier] May 15, 2001 press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mahindra Reva dealership Kathmandu 3.jpg|right|thumb|Two [[REVAi]]s and a [[Mahindra e2o]] at a Mahindra REVA dealership in Kathmandu, Nepal.]]

RECC joined up with several automotive experts to develop components for REVA. Curtis Instruments, Inc. of USA developed a Motor Controller specifically for the car. The car had a power pack for which Tudor India Limited supplied customized [[Prestolite Electric|Prestolite]] batteries. The Charger for Reva was developed by Modular Power Systems of USA (a division of [[TDI Power]]). Later, RECC started manufacturing the charger themselves through a technical collaboration agreement between MPS and the Maini Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revaindia.com/collabo.htm|title=Other Collaborators|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010409050952/http://www.revaindia.com/collabo.htm|archivedate=9 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 GoinGreen of the UK entered into an agreement with RECC to import REVA cars and market them under the [[REVAi|G-Wiz]] moniker.

In 2008 a revamped REVA model was launched called the [[REVAi]]. The company started production of a Lithium-ion variant called the [[REVA L-ion]] in 2009.

In 2009 at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], Reva presented its future models [[Reva NXR]] and Reva NXG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/09/16/frankfurt-2009-reva-nxg-looks-ready-to-stomp-nxr-is-ready-for|title=Frankfurt 2009: Reva NXG looks ready to stomp, NXR is ready for order|publisher=Autoblog Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the event Reva and [[General Motors India]] declared a technical collaboration to develop affordable EV for the Indian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/09/24/gm-india-and-reva-announce-electric-vehicle-partnership|title=GM India and Reva announce electric vehicle partnership|publisher=Autoblog Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this General Motors India announced an electric version of their hatchback in the New Delhi Auto Expo 2010: named the [[e-Spark]], Reva was to provide battery technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsmotoring.com/news/auto-expo-2010-e-spark-headed-here-in-october/1586/1|title=Auto Expo 2010: e-Spark headed here in October|publisher=Business Standard Motoring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2010, India's largest sports utility vehicles and tractor maker Mahindra &amp; Mahindra bought a 55.2% controlling stake in Reva. Following the deal, the company was renamed Mahindra Reva Electric Vehicles Private Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5js84m602eFQAY39bjXLeJpA14HIQ|title=India's Mahindra buys majority stake in Reva|publisher=AFP|date=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahindra’s president of automotive business, Pawan Goenka, became the new company’s chairman. As a result of the ownership change General Motors pulled out of the tie-up with [[Mahindra Reva|Reva]] that was to produce the e-spark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsmotoring.com/news/gm-to-pull-oute-spark-project/2100/1|title=GM to pull out of e-Spark project|publisher=Business Standard Motoring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Feb 2011 GoinGreen, the UK's exclusive importer of the G-Wiz, announced that it was no longer stocking the model (although it would order them on a 4-6-week lead time when requested by customers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2011/02/17/report-sales-of-g-wiz-electric-car-to-end-this-fall|title=Report: UK Sales of G-Wiz electric car to end this fall|publisher=Autoblog Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crave.cnet.co.uk/cartech/is-the-g-wiz-electric-car-finally-dead-50002819/|title=Is the G-Wiz electric car finally dead?|publisher=Rory Reid|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the company was rebranded as Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd. With the intention to reflect not just the business line of producing vehicles, but also developing powertrains and integrated mobility [[solution]]s.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mahindra's Electric Mobility Division Rebranded As 'Mahindra Electric'|url=https://auto.ndtv.com/news/mahindras-electric-mobility-division-rebranded-as-mahindra-electric-1456588|publisher=NDTV|date=Sep 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahindra e2o, previously REVA NXR, is an [[urban car|urban]] [[electric car]] [[hatchback]] manufactured by the Mahindra Group. The e2o is the [[REVA G-Wiz]] successor and was developed using REVA's technology. The REVA NXR electric [[concept car]] was unveiled at the 2009 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. Export production was initially scheduled for 2012. Production was initially scheduled for late 2010 with deliveries slated for early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/03/31/reva-explains-rescheduling-of-pilot-production-fpr-nxr-electric/|title=Reva explains "rescheduling" of pilot production of NXR electric car|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=12 June 2010|publisher=AutoblogGreen }}&lt;/ref&gt; The e2o was launched in India in March 2013 at a price of [[Indian rupee|Rs]] 596,000 ({{USD|11,000}}) after a 29% [[government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#India|government subsidy]] granted by the state of [[Delhi]]. The e2o was also launched in [[Mumbai]], [[Bangalore]], [[Pune]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Chandigarh]], and [[Kochi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5589">[[File:North American P-51 Mustang.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|The [[North American P-51 Mustang]] makes significant use of the Meredith effect in its belly radiator design.]]
The '''Meredith effect''' is a phenomenon whereby the [[aerodynamic drag]] produced by a [[Radiator (engine cooling)|cooling radiator]] may be offset by careful design of the cooling duct such that useful thrust is produced. The effect was discovered in the 1930s and became more important as the speeds of piston-engined aircraft increased over the next decade.

==Principles of operation==
The Meredith effect occurs when air flowing through a duct is heated by a heat-exchanger or radiator containing a hot working fluid such as [[ethylene glycol]]. Typically the fluid is a coolant carrying [[waste heat]] from an internal combustion engine.&lt;ref name=becker /&gt;

For the effect to occur, the duct must be travelling at a significant speed with respect to the air. Air flowing into the duct meets drag resistance from the radiator surface and is compressed due to the [[Ram-air intake|ram air effect]]. As the air flows through the radiator it is [[heat]]ed, raising its temperature slightly and further increasing its volume. The hot, pressurised air then exits through the exhaust duct which is shaped to be convergent, i.e. to narrow towards the rear. This accelerates the air backwards and the reaction of this acceleration against the installation provides a small forward thrust.&lt;ref name="Meredith"&gt;Meredith, F. W: "Cooling of Aircraft Engines. With Special Reference To Ethylene Glycol Radiators Enclosed In Ducts", Aeronautical Research Council R&amp;M 1683, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; The air expands and decreases temperature as it passes along the duct, before emerging to join the external air flow. Thus, the three processes of an open [[Brayton cycle]] are achieved: compression, heat addition at constant pressure and expansion. The thrust obtainable depends upon the pressure ratio between the inside and outside of the duct and the temperature of the coolant.&lt;ref name=becker /&gt; The higher boiling point of ethylene glycol compared to water allows the air to attain a higher temperature increasing the specific thrust.  

If the generated thrust is less than the aerodynamic drag of the ducting and radiator, then the arrangement serves to reduce the net aerodynamic drag of the radiator installation. If the generated thrust exceeds the aerodynamic drag of the installation, then the entire assemblage contributes a net forward thrust to the vehicle.

==History==
[[Fredrick Meredith|F. W. Meredith]] was a British engineer working at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE), [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]]. Reflecting on the principles of liquid cooling, he realized that what was conventionally regarded as waste heat, to be transferred to the atmosphere by a coolant in a radiator, need not be lost. The heat adds energy to the airflow and, with careful design, this may be used to generate thrust. The work was published in 1936.&lt;ref name="Meredith" /&gt;

The phenomenon became known as the "Meredith effect" and was quickly adopted by the designers of prototype fighter aircraft then under development, including the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]] whose Rolls-Royce PV-12 engine, later named the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]], was cooled by ethylene glycol. An early example of a Meredith effect radiator was incorporated in the design of the Spitfire for the first flight of the prototype on 5 March 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Gingell, G. (Ed.); "''The Supermarine Spitfire - 40 years on''," Royal Aeronautical Society, 1976, Page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many engineers did not understand the operating principles of the effect. A common mistake was the idea that the air-cooled [[radial engine]] would benefit most, because its fins ran hotter than the radiator of a liquid-cooled engine, with the mistake persisting even as late as 1949.&lt;ref name=becker /&gt;

The [[North American P-51 Mustang]], which first flew in 1940, adopted both the Merlin engine and the Meredith principle.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne, Bill: Rockwell: The Heritage of North American. New York: Crescent Books, 1989. Page 49, {{ISBN|0-517-67252-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time the Meredith effect also inspired early American work on the aero-thermodynamic duct or [[ramjet]], due to the similarity of their principles of operation.&lt;ref name=becker&gt;Becker, J.; "''The high-speed frontier: Case histories of four NACA programs, 1920-1950''," SP-445, NASA (1980), Chapter 5: High-speed Cowlings, Air Inlets and Outlets, and Internal-Flow Systems: The ramjet investigation. [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-445/ch5-5.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meredith effect was incorporated into the [[AIAA]] award-winning design of the [[Cratus (aircraft)|Cratus]] racing airplane by [[University of Kansas]] aerospace engineering student Samantha Schueler in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2012/oct/03/lawrence-douglas-county-housing-authority-studying/ |title=Student’s aircraft design wins top honor / LJWorld.com |publisher=.ljworld.com |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/Secondary.aspx?id=13682 |title=AIAA Foundation Announces Winners of 2011-2012 Undergraduate Individual Aircraft Design Competition : The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |publisher=Aiaa.org |date=2012-09-11 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction and History==

First true micropumps were reported in the mid-1970s,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, L.J. and Bessman, S.P.  (1975) "Micropump powered by piezoelectric disk benders", {{US Patent|3963380}}&lt;/ref&gt; but attracted interest only in the 1980s, when Jan Smits and Harald Van Lintel developed [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] micropumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Woias, P|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2004.02.033|title= Micropumps – past progress and future prospects|journal= Sensors and Actuators B. |volume=105|issue= 1|pages=28–38|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the fundamental MEMS micropump work was done in the 1990s. More recently, efforts have been made to design non-mechanical micropumps that are functional in remote locations due to their non-dependence on external power.

==Types and Technology==
Within the microfluidic world, physical laws change their appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cafefoundation.org/v2/pav_orderfromchaos.php Order from Chaos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723165004/http://www.cafefoundation.org/v2/pav_orderfromchaos.php |date=2008-07-23 }}, The CAFE Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, volumetric forces, such as weight or inertia, often become negligible, whereas surface forces can dominate fluidical behaviour, especially when gas inclusion in liquids is present. With only a few exceptions, micropumps rely on micro-actuation principles, which can reasonably be scaled up only to a certain size.

Micropumps can be grouped into mechanical and non-mechanical devices.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Abhari, Farideh|author2=Jaafar, Haslina|author3=Yunus, Nurul Amziah Md|lastauthoramp=yes|year=2012|title=A Comprehensive Study of Micropumps Technologies|url=http://www.electrochemsci.org/papers/vol7/71009765.pdf|journal=International Journal of Electrochemical Science|volume=7|issue=10|pages=9765–9780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical systems contain moving parts, which are usually actuation and [[microvalve]] membranes or flaps. The driving force can be generated by utilizing [[piezoelectric]], [[electrostatic]], thermo-pneumatic, [[pneumatic]] or [[magnetic]] effects. Non-mechanical pumps function with electro-hydrodynamic, [[electroosmotic flow|electro-osmotic]], electrochemical &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neagu|first1=C.R.|last2=Gardeniers|first2=J.G.E.|last3=Elwenspoek|first3=M.|last4=Kelly|first4=J.J.|year=1996|title=An electrochemical microactuator: principle and first results|url=http://doc.utwente.nl/14222/|journal=Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems|volume=5|issue=1|pages=2–9|doi=10.1109/84.485209}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] flow generation, just to name a few of the actuation mechanisms that are currently studied.

===Mechanical Micropumps===

====Diaphragm Micropumps====

A diaphragm micropump uses the repeated actuation of a diaphragm to drive a fluid. The membrane is positioned above a main pump valve, which is centered between inlet and outlet [[microvalve]]s. When the membrane is deflected upwards through some driving force, fluid is pulled into the inlet valve into the main pump valve. The membrane is then lowered, expelling the fluid through the outlet valve. This process is repeated to pump fluid continuously.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Peristaltic Micropumps ====
A peristaltic micropump is a micropump composed of at least three [[microvalve]]s in series. These three valves are opened and closed sequentially in order to pull fluid from the inlet to the outlet in a process known as peristalsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smits|first=Jan G.|title=Piezoelectric micropump with three valves working peristaltically|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0924424790850397|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|volume=21|issue=1–3|pages=203–206|doi=10.1016/0924-4247(90)85039-7|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Mechanical Micropumps ===

====Valveless Micropumps====

Static valves are defined as valves which have fixed geometry without any moving parts. These valves provide flow rectification through addition of energy (active) or inducing desired flow behavior by fluid inertia (passive). Two most common types of static geometry passive valves are Diffuser-Nozzle Elements &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stemme and Stemme|year=1993|title=A valveless diffuser/nozzle-based fluid pump|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|volume=39|issue=2|pages=159–167|doi=10.1016/0924-4247(93)80213-Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=van der Wijngaart|year=2001|title=A valve-less diffuser micropump for microfluidic analytical systems|journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical|volume=72|issue=3|pages=259–265|doi=10.1016/S0925-4005(00)00644-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tesla valves. Micropumps having nozzle-diffuser elements as flow rectification device are commonly known as Valveless Micropumps.

====Capillary Pumps====

In microfluidics, capillary pumping plays an important role because the pumping action does not require external actuation power. Glass capillaries and porous media, including nitrocellulose paper and synthetic paper,&lt;ref name="Synthetic microfluidic paper"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jonas Hansson |author2=Hiroki Yasuga |author3=Tommy Haraldsson |author4=Wouter van der Wijngaart | year = 2016 | title = Synthetic microfluidic paper: high surface area and high porosity polymer micropillar arrays | url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/LC/C5LC01318F#!divAbstract | journal = Lab on a Chip |volume= 16 |issue=2 |pages= 298–304 |doi=10.1039/C5LC01318F|pmid=26646057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be integrated into microfluidic chips. Capillary pumping is widely used in lateral flow testing. Recently, novel capillary pumps, with a constant pumping flow rate independent of the liquid viscosity and surface energy,&lt;ref name="synthetic paper pump"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weijin Guo |author2=Jonas Hansson |author3=Wouter van der Wijngaart | year = 2016 | title = Viscosity Independent Paper Microfluidic Imbibition | url = https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1048748/FULLTEXT01.pdf| journal = MicroTAS 2016, Dublin, Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="viscosity independent pump"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weijin Guo |author2=Jonas Hansson |author3=Wouter van der Wijngaart | year = 2016 | title = Capillary Pumping Independent of Liquid Sample Viscosity | journal = Langmuir |volume= 32 |issue= 48 |pages= 12650–12655 |doi=10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b03488|pmid=27798835 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liquid properties independent pump 1"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Weijin Guo |author2=Jonas Hansson |author3=Wouter van der Wijngaart | year = 2017 | title = Capillary pumping with a constant flow rate independent of the liquid sample viscosity and surface energy | url =http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7863410/| journal = IEEE MEMS 2017, las Vegas, USA|pages=339–341 |doi=10.1109/MEMSYS.2017.7863410|isbn=978-1-5090-5078-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liquid properties independent pump 2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weijin Guo |author2=Jonas Hansson |author3=Wouter van der Wijngaart | year = 2018 | title = Capillary pumping independent of the liquid surface energy and viscosity | url =https://www.nature.com/articles/s41378-018-0002-9| journal = Microsystems &amp; Nanoengineering, 2018, 4(1): 2|volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=2 |doi=10.1038/s41378-018-0002-9|bibcode=2018MicNa...4....2G }}&lt;/ref&gt; were developed, which have a significant advantage over the traditional capillary pump (of which the flow behaviour is Washburn behaviour, namely the flow rate is not constant) because their performance does not depend on the sample viscosity.

====Chemically Powered Pumps====

Chemically powered non-mechanical pumps have been fabricated by affixing [[nanomotors]] to surfaces, driving fluid flow through chemical reactions. A wide variety of pumping systems exist including biological enzyme based pumps,&lt;ref name="pizza1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sengupta, S. |author2=Patra, D. |author3=Ortiz-Rivera, I. |author4=Agrawal, A. |author5=Shklyaev, S. |author6=Dey, K.

==Applications==
Micropumps have potential industrial applications, such as delivery of small amounts of glue during manufacturing processes, and biomedical applications, including portable or implanted drug delivery devices.

A '''paperweight''' is a small solid object heavy enough, when placed on top of papers, to keep them from blowing away in a breeze or from moving under the strokes of a painting brush (as with [[Japanese calligraphy]]).  While any object (like a stone) can serve as a paperweight, decorative paperweights of glass are produced, either by individual artisans or factories, usually in limited editions, and are collected as works of fine [[glass art]], some of which are exhibited in museums.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, Paul and Lanmon, Dwight P. ''Paperweight:  "Flowers which clothe the Meadows"'' Corning Museum of Glass, (1978) p 22, {{ISBN|0-87290-065-7}}''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selman, Lawrence H. and Pope-Selman, Linda ''Paperweights for Collectors'' Paperweight Press (1978) p 144.&lt;/ref&gt;  First produced in about 1845, particularly in France, such decorative paperweights declined in popularity before undergoing a revival in the mid-twentieth century.

==Basic features==
Decorative glass paperweights have a flat or slightly concave base, usually polished but sometimes frosted, cut in one of several variations (e.g. star-cut bases have a multi-pointed star, while a diamond cut base has grooves cut in a criss-cross pattern), although a footed weight has a flange in the base.  The ground on which the inner parts rest may be clear or colored, made of unfused sand, or resemble lace (latticinio).&lt;ref&gt;Bergstrom, Evangiline H. ''Old Glass Paperweights:  Their Art, Construction and Distinguishing Features'' Lakeside Press, 1940 Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The domed top is usually faceted or cut and made of [[lead glass]] and may be coated with one or more thin layers of colored glass, and have windows cut through it to reveal the interior motif.  The exact shape or profile of the dome varies from one artist or factory to another, but in fine examples will act as a lens that, as one moves the weight about, attractively various the inner design's appearance.  A magnifying glass is often used to gain appreciation of the fine detail of the work within. In a modern piece, an identifying mark and date are imperative.{{citation needed |date=September 2015}}

Paperweights are made by individual artisans or in factories where many artists and technicians collaborate; both may produce inexpensive as well as "collector" weights. 

Workmanship, design, rarity, and condition determine a paperweight's value: its glass should not have a yellow or greenish cast,{{citation needed |date=September 2015}} and there should be no unintentional asymmetries, or unevenly spaced or broken elements. Visible flaws, such as bubbles, striations and scratches lessen the value.   

Antique paperweights, of which perhaps 10,000 or so survive (mostly in museums{{citation needed |date=September 2015}}), generally appreciate steadily in value;{{citation needed |date=September 2015}} as of August 2018 the record price was the $258,500 paid in 1990 for an antique French weight.&lt;ref&gt;Reily, Pat ''Paperweights'' (1994) p 8 {{ISBN|1-56138-433-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, Paul H. ''The Dictionary of Glass Paperweights'', Papier Presse (2009) p 267 {{ISBN|978-0-9619547-5-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Antique paperweights were made in the "classic" years between 1845 and 1860 primarily&lt;ref&gt;Flemming, M. and Pommerencke, P., ''Paperweights of the World'' Schiffer Publishing, (1993) p 26-29 {{ISBN|0-88740-592-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in three French factories named [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat]], St. Louis,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Cristallerie de Saint-Louis-lès-Bitche|St. Louis]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Clichy.  Together, they made between 15,000 and 25,000 weights in the classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Ingold, Gerard ''The Art of the Paperweight:  Saint Louis'' Paperweight Press (1995) p 23 {{ISBN|0-933756-21-6}} &lt;/ref&gt; Weights (mainly of lesser quality) were also made in the United States, United Kingdom, and elsewhere, though [[George Bacchus &amp; Sons|Bacchus (UK)]] and [[New England Glass Company]] (US) produced some that equaled the best of the French. Modern weights have been made from about 1950 to the present.

In the US, Charles Kaziun started in 1940 to produce buttons, paperweights, inkwells and other bottles, using lamp-work of elegant simplicity.  In Scotland, the pioneering work of Paul Ysart from the 1930s onward preceded a new generation of artists such as William Manson, Peter McDougall, Peter Holmes and John Deacons.  A further impetus to reviving interest in paperweights was the publication of Evangiline Bergstrom's book, ''Old Glass Paperweights'', the first of a new genre.

A number of small studios appeared in the middle 20th century, particularly in the US.  These may have several to some dozens of workers with various levels of skill cooperating to produce their own distinctive "line".  Notable examples are Lundberg Studios, Orient and Flume, Correia Art Glass, St.Clair, Lotton, and Parabelle Glass.&lt;ref&gt;Flemming, M., p 38-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 1960s and early 70s, artists such as Francis Whittemore,&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, Paul H. p354 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Joseph Stankard|Paul Stankard]],&lt;ref&gt; Dunlop, Paul H. p315-317&lt;/ref&gt; his former assistant Jim D'Onofrio,&lt;ref&gt; Dunlop, Paul H. p 123&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Buzzini,&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, Paul H. p 267&lt;/ref&gt; Delmo&lt;ref&gt; Dunlop, Paul H. p 328&lt;/ref&gt; and daughter Debbie Tarsitano,&lt;ref&gt; Dunlop, Paul H. p 326&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Trabucco&lt;ref&gt; Dunlop, Paul H.  p 335&lt;/ref&gt; and sons, Gordon Smith,&lt;ref&gt; Dunlop, Paul H. p 304&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Ayotte&lt;ref&gt; Dunlop, Paul H. p 267&lt;/ref&gt; and his daughter Melissa, the father and son team of Bob and Ray Banford,&lt;ref&gt; Dunlop, Paul H. p 44 &amp; 45 &lt;/ref&gt; and Ken Rosenfeld&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, Paul H., p275&lt;/ref&gt; began breaking new ground and were able to produce fine paperweights rivaling anything produced in the classic period.

=== Types of glass paperweights ===
[[File:StLouisTaracco.png|left|180px|thumb|Modern (1994) St. Louis Taracco carpet ground]]

Collectors may specialize in one of several types of paperweights, but more often they wind up with an eclectic mix.

[[Millefiori]] (Italian - "thousand flowers") paperweights contain thin cross-sections of cylindrical composite canes made from colored rods and usually resemble little flowers, although they can be designed after anything, even letters and dates.  These are usually made in a factory setting.  They exist in many variations such as scattered, patterned, close concentric or carpet ground.  Sometimes the canes are formed into a sort of upright tuft shaped like a mushroom that is encased in the dome. The year of manufacture is sometimes enclosed in one of the canes.

[[Lampwork]] paperweights have objects such as flowers, fruit, butterflies or animals constructed by shaping and working bits of colored glass with a gas burner or torch and assembling them into attractive compositions, which are then incorporated into the dome.  This is a form particularly favored by studio artists.  The objects are often stylized, but may be highly realistic.

Sulfide paperweights have an encased [[cameo (carving)|cameo]]-like medallion or portrait plaque made from a special ceramic that is able to reproduce very fine detail.  These are known as incrustations, cameo incrustations, or sulphides. They often are produced to commemorate some person or event.&lt;ref&gt;Selman, p 97-105&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 1700s through the end of the 1900s, an amazing variety of glass objects, including paperweights, were made with incrustations. The finest collection of incrustations ever assembled was by Paul Jokelson,&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, Paul H., The Jokelson Collection of Cameo Incrustation, Papier Presse (1991) {{ISBN|0-9619547-3-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; collector, author and founder of the Paperweight Collectors' Association. A part of his collection was gifted to the Corning Museum of Glass, with the remaining portion being sold in London in the 1990s. Although still produced today, their heyday was before the classic period.

Most paperweights, which are considered works of art, use one of the above techniques; millefiori, lampwork or sulphide — all techniques that had been around long before the advent of paperweights. A fourth technique, a crimp flower, usually a rose, originated in the Millville, New Jersey area in the first decade of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Newell,Clarence A. ''Old Glass Paperweights of Southern New Jersey'' (1989) {{ISBN|0-9619547-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often called a Millville rose, these weights range from simple folk art to fine works of art, depending on the maker.  

Fine weights not made with any of the major techniques include swirls, marbries and crowns. Swirl paperweights have opaque rods of two or three colors radiating like a pinwheel from a central millefiori floret.  A similar style, the marbrie, is a paperweight that has several bands of color close to the surface that descend from the apex in a looping pattern to the bottom of the weight. Crown paperweights have twisted ribbons, alternately colored and white filigree which radiate from a central millefiori floret at the top, down to converge again at the base.  This was first devised in the Saint Louis factory and remains popular today.
[[File:BaccaratPansy.png|right|180px|thumb|Antique Baccarat pansy]]

Miniature weights have a diameter of less than two inches or so, and magnums have a diameter greater than about 3.25&amp;nbsp;inches.

California-style paperweights are made by "painting" the surface of the dome with colored molten glass (torchwork), and manipulated with picks or other tools. They may also be sprayed while hot with various metallic salts to achieve an [[iridescent]] look.

[[Victorian era|Victorian]] portrait and advertising paperweights were dome glass paperweights first made in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania using a process patented in 1882 by William H. Maxwell. The portrait paperweights contained pictures of ordinary people reproduced on a [[milk glass]] disk and encased within clear glass. This same process was also used to produce paperweights with the owner's name encased or an advertisement of a business or product.  Pittsburgher Albert A. Graeser, patented a different process for making advertising paperweights in 1892. The Graeser process involved sealing an image to the underside of a rectangular [[glass blank]] using a milk glass or enamel-like glaze. Many paperweights of the late 19th century are marked either J. N. Abrams or Barnes and Abrams and may list either the 1882 Maxwell or 1892 Graeser patent date. It has been theorized that Barnes and Abrams did not actually manufacture advertising paperweights for their customers, but instead subcontracted the actual manufacturing task out to Pittsburgh area glasshouses. The Paperweight Collectors Association Annual Bulletins published in 2000, 2001 and 2002 describe these in detail.

[[Bohemian]] paperweights were particularly popular in Victorian times.  Large engraved or cut hollow spheres of ruby glass were a common form.

===Museum collections===
The United States has a number of museums exhibiting outstanding paperweight collections. Many collectors consider the finest of these to be the [[Arthur Rubloff]] collection at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], which expanded its exhibition in 2012. The Bergstrom-Mahler Museum in [[Neenah, Wisconsin]], exhibits the Evangeline Bergstrom collection. The [[Corning Museum of Glass]] in [[Corning, New York]], exhibits the [[Amory Houghton]] collection. The [[Yelverton Paperweight Centre]] in Devon, England, a collection of over 1,000 paperweights, closed in 2013.

Another museum with a notable exhibition of outstanding American paperweights is in the Museum of American Glass at the [[WheatonArts|Wheaton Arts and Cultural Center]] in [[Millville, New Jersey]]. In 1998, Henry Melville Fuller donated 330 twentieth-century paperweights to the [[Currier Museum of Art]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]].

===Paperweight collectors===
There are many paperweight collectors worldwide. Several collectors' associations hold national or regional conventions, and sponsor activities such as tours, lectures, and auctions. Famous collectors include the literary figures [[Colette]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Truman Capote]]. [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugenie]] (Napoleon III's wife), [[Charlotte of Belgium|Empress Carlotta]] (wife of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]]) and [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk, King of Egypt]]&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, Paul H. The Dictionary of Glass Paperweights p13&lt;/ref&gt; were also avid collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p 21&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting histories of Rubloff, Bergstrom, and Houghton were similar. They had two things in common — a passion for their collecting, and the privilege of having sufficient financial resources to build extensive collections of very rare and expensive weights. Another famous collector was [[Lothar-Günther Buchheim]], the German author and painter. He is best known for his novel ''[[Das Boot]]'' (1973), which became an international bestseller and was adapted in 1981 as an Oscar-nominated film. His collection of about 3,000 paperweights can be seen at his museum in Germany - Museum der Phanthasie - in Bernried, Bavaria, Starnberger See (Lake). Marnie Bjornson has amassed one of the most notable collections in Canada, focusing on the history of the Icelandic communities of [[Manitoba]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7020">'''Parasitic capacitance''', or '''stray capacitance''' is an unavoidable and usually unwanted capacitance that exists between the parts of an [[electronic component]] or [[Electrical circuit|circuit]] simply because of their proximity to each other. When two [[electrical conductor]]s at different voltages are close together, the electric field between them causes [[electric charge]] to be stored on them; this effect is parasitic capacitance.  All actual [[circuit element]]s such as [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s, and [[transistor]]s have internal capacitance, which can cause their behavior to depart from that of 'ideal' circuit elements.  Additionally, there is always non-zero capacitance between any two conductors; this can be significant at higher frequencies with closely spaced conductors, such as wires or [[printed circuit board]] traces.  

The parasitic capacitance between the turns of an inductor or other wound component is often described as ''self-capacitance''.  However, the term [[self-capacitance]] more correctly refers to a different phenomenon; the capacitance of a conductive object without reference to another object.

==Description==
When two conductors at different [[potential]]s are close to one another, they are affected by each other's [[electric field]] and store opposite [[electric charge]]s like a capacitor.  Changing the potential ''v'' between the conductors requires a current ''i'' into or out of the conductors to charge or discharge them.
:&lt;math&gt;i = C \frac{dv}{dt} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''C'' is the capacitance between the conductors.  For example, an [[inductor]] often acts as though it includes a parallel [[capacitor]], because of its closely spaced [[winding]]s.  When a [[potential]] difference exists across the coil, wires lying adjacent to each other are at different potentials.  They act like the plates of a capacitor, and store [[Electric charge|charge]].  Any change in the voltage across the coil requires extra [[Electric current|current]] to charge and discharge these small 'capacitors'.   When the voltage changes only slowly, as in low-frequency circuits, the extra current is usually negligible, but when the voltage changes quickly the extra current is larger and can affect the operation of the circuit.

Coils for high frequencies are often [[Basket winding|basket-wound]] to minimise parasitic capacitance.

==Effects==
At low [[Frequency|frequencies]] parasitic capacitance can usually be ignored, but in high frequency circuits it can be a major problem.  In [[amplifier]] circuits with extended frequency response, parasitic capacitance between the output and the input can act as a [[feedback]] path, causing the circuit to [[oscillate]] at high frequency.  These unwanted oscillations are called ''[[parasitic oscillation]]s''.  

In high frequency amplifiers, parasitic capacitance can combine with [[Parasitic element (electrical networks)|stray inductance]] such as component leads to form [[resonant circuit]]s, also leading to parasitic oscillations.  In all inductors, the parasitic capacitance will resonate with the inductance at some high frequency to make the inductor ''self-resonant''; this is called the [[self-resonant frequency]].  Above this frequency, the inductor actually has [[capacitive reactance]]. 

The capacitance of the load circuit attached to the output of [[op amp]]s can reduce their [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].   High-frequency circuits require special design techniques such as careful separation of wires and components, guard rings, [[ground plane]]s, [[power plane]]s, [[Electromagnetic shielding|shielding]] between input and output, [[Electrical termination|termination]] of lines, and [[stripline]]s to minimise the effects of unwanted capacitance.   

In closely spaced cables and [[Bus (computer)|computer busses]], parasitic capacitive coupling can cause [[crosstalk]], which means the signal from one circuit bleeds into another, causing interference and unreliable operation.

[[Electronic design automation]] computer programs, which are used to design commercial [[printed circuit board]]s, can calculate the parasitic capacitance and other parasitic effects of both components and circuit board traces, and include them in simulations of circuit operation.  This is called [[parasitic extraction]].

===Miller capacitance===
{{main|Miller effect}}

The parasitic capacitance between the input and output electrodes of inverting amplifying devices, such as between the base and collector of [[transistor]]s, is particularly troublesome because it is multiplied by the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of the device.  This ''Miller capacitance'' (first noted in vacuum tubes by [[John Milton Miller]], 1920) is the major factor limiting the high frequency performance of active devices like transistors and [[vacuum tube]]s.  The [[screen grid]] was added to [[triode]] vacuum tubes in the 1920s to reduce parasitic capacitance between the [[control grid]] and the [[Plate electrode|plate]], creating the [[tetrode]], which resulted in a great increase in operating frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alley|first=Charles L.|author2=Atwood, Kenneth W.|date=1973|title=Electronic Engineering, 3rd Ed.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons.|location=New York|isbn=0-471-02450-3|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Impedance Multiplier.png|thumb|Effect of parasitic capacitance '''''Z''''' = '''''C''''' between the input and output of an amplifier]]
The diagram, right, illustrates how Miller capacitance comes about.  Suppose the amplifier shown is an ideal inverting amplifier with voltage gain of '''''A''''', and '''''Z''''' = '''''C''''' is a capacitance between its input and output.  The output voltage of the amplifier is
:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{o} = -Av_\text{i}\,&lt;/math&gt;
The current into the input terminal is 
:&lt;math&gt;i_\text{i} = C{d \over dt}(v_\text{i} - v_\text{o}) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i_\text{i} = C{d \over dt}(v_\text{i} + Av_\text{i}) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i_\text{i} = C(1 + A){dv_\text{i} \over dt} \,&lt;/math&gt;
So the capacitance at the input of the amplifier is
:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{M} = C(1 + A) \,&lt;/math&gt;
The input capacitance is multiplied by the gain of the amplifier.  This is the Miller capacitance.
If the input circuit has an impedance to ground of '''''R'''''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, then (assuming no other amplifier poles) the output of the amplifier is
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{o} = \frac{A}{1 + j\omega R_\text{i}C_\text{M} }V_\text{i} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the amplifier is limited by the high frequency roll-off at
:&lt;math&gt;f = {1 \over 2\pi R_\text{i}C_\text{M}}  = {1 \over  2\pi R_\text{i}C(1 + A)} \,&lt;/math&gt;
So the bandwidth is reduced by the factor (1 + '''''A'''''), approximately the voltage gain of the device.  The voltage gain of modern transistors can be 10 - 100 or even higher, so this is a significant limitation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4397">In [[fluid mechanics]], it may be necessary to determine how a fluid [[velocity]] changes across the flow. This can be done with a '''shell balance'''.

A shell is a [[differential element]] of the flow. By looking at the momentum and forces on one small portion, it is possible to integrate over the flow to see the larger picture of the flow as a whole. The balance is determining what goes into and out of the shell. [[Momentum]] enters and leaves the shell through fluid entering and leaving the shell and through [[shear stress]]. In addition, there are [[pressure]] and [[gravity]] [[forces]] on the shell. The goal of a shell balance is to determine the velocity profile of the flow. The velocity profile is an equation to calculate the velocity based on a specific location in the flow. From this, it is possible to find a velocity for any point across the flow.

== Applications ==

Shell Balances can be used for many situations. For example, flow in a pipe, flow of multiple fluids around each other, or flow due to pressure difference. Although terms in the shell balance and boundary conditions will change, the basic set up and process is the same. This system is useful to analyze any fluid flow that holds true for the requirements listed below.

== Requirements ==

In order for a shell balance to work, the flow must:

#Be [[laminar flow]]
#Be without bends or curves in the flow
# [[Steady State]]
#Have two boundary conditions

Boundary Conditions are used to find constants of integration.

#[[Fluid]] - [[Solid]] Boundary: [[No-slip condition]], the velocity of a liquid at a solid is equal to the velocity of the solid
#[[Liquid]] - [[Gas]] Boundary: [[Shear Stress]] = 0
#Liquid - Liquid Boundary: Equal [[velocity]] and [[shear stress]] on both liquids

== Performing shell balances ==

The following is an outline of how to perform a basic shell balance.&lt;br /&gt;
If fluid is flowing between two horizontal surfaces, each with area A touching the fluid, a differential shell of height Δy can be drawn between them as shown in the diagram below.

[[File:Shell Balance Diagram.png|Diagram of the shell balance process in fluid mechanics]]

In this example,
the top surface is moving at velocity U and the bottom surface is stationary&lt;br /&gt;
[[density]] of fluid = ρ &lt;br /&gt;
[[viscosity]] of fluid = μ&lt;br /&gt;
velocity in x direction = &lt;math&gt;V_x&lt;/math&gt;, shown by the diagonal line above. This is what a shell balance is solving for.

'''[[Conservation of Momentum]] is the Key of a Shell Balance'''

rate of [[momentum]] in - rate of momentum out + sum of all forces = 0

To perform a shell balance, follow the following basic steps:

1. Find momentum from shear stress

(Momentum from Shear Stress Into System) - (Momentum from Shear Stress Out of System)

Momentum from Shear Stress goes into the shell at ''y'' and leaves the system at ''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''y''.

Shear stress = ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''yx''&lt;/sub&gt;, area = ''A'', momentum = ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''yx''&lt;/sub&gt;''A''

2. Find momentum from flow

Momentum flows into the system at ''x''&amp;nbsp;= 0 and out at ''x''&amp;nbsp;= ''L''

The flow is steady state. Therefore, the momentum flow at ''x''&amp;nbsp;= 0 is equal to the moment of flow at ''x''&amp;nbsp;= ''L''. Therefore, these cancel out.

3. Find [[gravity]] force on the shell

4. Find [[pressure]] forces

5. Plug into conservation of momentum and solve for ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''yx''&lt;/sub&gt;

6. Apply Newton's law of viscosity for a [[Newtonian fluid]]

''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''yx''&lt;/sub&gt; = -''μ''(''dV''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;/''dy'')

7. Integrate to find equation for velocity and use Boundary Conditions to find constants of integration

Boundary 1: Top Surface: y = 0 and V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = U

Boundary 2: Bottom Surface: y = D and V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 0

A '''snapper''' is a [[mechanical puzzle]] consisting of a pointed piece attached to a notched dowel and a hollow block with a secondary hole along its length through which a rubber-band is stretched (across the shaft) and tied off. A demonstrator inserts the dowel into the hollow block, hooks the rubber-band on the notch, pulls on the pointed end, and allows the dowel to snap back into place. The demonstrator hands the puzzle to an observer who cannot hook the rubber-band onto the dowel's notch. The demonstrator takes the puzzle back and makes it snap immediately. The trick is that the ends of the dowel are tapered so that the demonstrator can squeeze the fingers holding it together, causing it to snap into the block.

== Construction ==
Traditionally made of wood, contemporary varieties come in plastic or metal for enhanced durability.

== Variations ==
A variation on this puzzle inserts the rubber-band into the shaft of the block opposite the pointed piece. At least one variation allows the demonstrator to hook the rubber band and show it to observers.

'''Suessite''' is a rare iron [[silicide]] mineral with chemical formula: Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si.&lt;ref&gt;(2010) Suessite Glossary of Geology, American Geological Institute,  &lt;http://glossary.agiweb.org&gt;. Accessed 13 September, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The mineral was named after Professor [[Hans E. Suess]]. It was discovered in 1982 during the chemical analysis of The North Haig [[olivine]] [[pigeonite]] [[achondrite]] ([[ureilite]]). It is a cream white color in reflected light, and ranges in size from 1 μm "blebs" to elongated grains that can reach up to 0.45&amp;nbsp;cm in length.&lt;ref&gt;Keil, K., Berkley, J. L., and Fuchs, L.H. (1982) Suessite, Fe3Si: a New Mineral in the North Haig Ureilite. American Mineralogist, 67, 126.&lt;/ref&gt;  This mineral belongs in the isometric crystal class.  The isometric class has crystallographic axes that are all the same length and each of the three axes [[perpendicular]] to the other two.  It is isotropic, has a structural type of DO3 and a crystal lattice of BiF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Norvgorodova, M.I., Yosopov, R.G., Dmitrieva, M.T., Tsepin, A.I., Sivtsov, A.V., Gorshkov, A.I., Korovoshkin, V.V., and  Yakubovskaya, N.Y. (1984) First Occurrence of Suessite on the Earth. International Geology Review, 26, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Optical Properties ==

Suessite is an [[isotropic]] mineral, Isotropism is defined as an optical property of a mineral that stays the same from whatever direction it is observed. In thin-section microscopy, an isotropic mineral has only one refractive index. This means that light that passes through the mineral is not split into two different directions, but it passes through unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, C. and Dutrow, B. (2008) The Manual of Mineral Science, 23rd Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Suessite, as determined from the previous definition, only has one [[index of refraction]]. When Keil, Fuchs, and Berkley first discovered the mineral they described it as having a relatively low [[optical relief]], but there was no determination of the index of refraction.&lt;ref&gt;Keil, K., Berkley, J. L., and Fuchs, L.H. (1982) Suessite, Fe3Si: a New Mineral in the North Haig Ureilite. American Mineralogist, 67, 126.&lt;/ref&gt;  In plane polarized light, suessite is a reddish-brown color that shows no [[pleochroism]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, C. and Dutrow, B. (2008) The Manual of Mineral Science, 23rd Edition&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Importance of suessite==
"Suessite can form under highly reducing conditions" say the scientists who discovered this mineral.  Only one out of eight ureilites studied (the North Haig ureilite) by this group contained suessite. Most contained trace amounts of [[kamacite]] which is the mineral from which Suessite is formed. In this particular study, the meteorite that contained suessite contained the highest amounts of [[shock metamorphism]], which can be determined from the size of a [[shatter cone]] created from the impact.  This could mean that suessite is formed due to the extreme increase in temperature combined with reduction of silicate rims, shortly followed by a rapid decrease in temperature.  This means that, in meteorites, the abundance of suessite can be used to identify deformation associated with shock metamorphism, which could be used to determine various characteristics of the studied meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;Keil, K., Berkley, J. L., and Fuchs, L.H. (1982) Suessite, Fe3Si: a New Mineral in the North Haig Ureilite. American Mineralogist, 67, 126.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Other iron silicide minerals==
The other natural iron silicides include gupeiite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si), hapkeite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si), linzhiite (FeSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), luobusaite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.84&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), naquite (FeSi), [[xifengite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and zangboite (TiFeSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Mindat, http://www.mindat.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2863">In [[chemistry]], '''topology''' provides a convenient way of describing and predicting the [[molecular structure]] within the constraints of three-dimensional (3-D) space.  Given the determinants of [[chemical bond]]ing and the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of the [[atom]]s, topology provides a model for explaining how the atoms ethereal [[wave function]]s must fit together.  Molecular topology is a part of [[mathematical chemistry]] dealing with the algebraic description of chemical compounds so allowing a unique and easy characterization of them.

Topology is insensitive to the details of a [[scalar field]], and can often be determined using simplified calculations.  Scalar fields such as [[electron density]], [[Erwin Madelung|Madelung]] field, [[covalent]] field and the [[electrostatic potential]] can be used to model topology.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David; Topology and Chemistry; Structural Chemistry Volume 13, Numbers 3–4, 339–355, {{doi|10.1023/A:1015872125545}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Each scalar field has its own distinctive topology and each provides different information about the nature of chemical bonding and structure. The analysis of these topologies, when combined with simple electrostatic theory and a few empirical observations, leads to a quantitative model of localized chemical bonding. In the process, the analysis provides insights into the nature of chemical bonding.

Applied topology explains how large molecules reach their final shapes and how biological molecules achieve their activity.

[[Circuit topology]] is a topological property of folded linear polymers. This notion has been applied to structural analysis of biomolecules such as proteins and RNAs. 

==Topological indices==
It is possible to set up equations correlating direct quantitative structure activity relationships with experimental properties, usually referred to as [[Topological index|topological indices]] (TIs).  Topological indices are used in the development of [[quantitative structure-activity relationship]]s (QSARs) in which the biological activity or other properties of molecules are correlated with their chemical structure.

A '''turbo generator''' is the combination of a [[turbine]] directly connected to an [[electric generator]] for the generation of [[electric power]]. Large [[Steam turbine|steam-powered]] turbo generators provide the majority of the world's electricity and are also used by steam-powered [[turbo-electric]] ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labplan.ufsc.br/congressos/PowerTech07/papers/664.pdf|title=The turbogenerator – A continuous engineering challenge|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821180100/http://www.labplan.ufsc.br/congressos/PowerTech07/papers/664.pdf|archivedate=2010-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller turbo-generators with [[gas turbine]]s are often used as [[auxiliary power unit]]s. For base loads [[diesel generator]]s are usually preferred, since they offer better [[fuel efficiency]], but, on the other hand, diesel generators have a lower power density and hence, require more space.

The efficiency of larger gas turbine plants can be enhanced by using a [[combined cycle]], where the hot [[exhaust gas]]es are used to generate [[steam]] which drives another turbo generator.

==History==
The first turbo-generators were [[water turbines]] which propelled electric generators. [[Ireland|Irish]] engineer [[Charles Algernon Parsons]] demonstrated a DC steam-powered turbogenerator using a [[dynamo]] in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turbo generators were also used on steam locomotives as a power source for coach lighting and heating systems.

== Construction features ==
Unlike [[hydraulic turbine]]s which usually operate at lower speeds (100 to 600 rpm), the efficiency of a [[steam turbine]] is higher at higher speeds and therefore a turbo generator is used for steam turbines. The [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] of a turbo generator is a [[non-salient rotor|non-salient pole]] type usually with two poles.&lt;ref name="Basic Electrical Engineering (Be 104) p. 8.1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Basic Electrical Engineering (Be 104) | publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Limited | isbn=978-1-259-08116-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtoM4dbYvE0C&amp;pg=SA8-PA1 | access-date=8 August 2017 | page=8.1 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211234348/https://books.google.com/books?id=LtoM4dbYvE0C&amp;pg=SA8-PA1 | archivedate=11 February 2018 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal speed of a turbo generator is 1500 or 3000 rpm with four or two poles at 50 Hz (1800 or 3600 rpm with four or two poles at 60 Hz). Salient rotors will be very noisy and with a lot of windage loss. The rotating parts of a turbo generator are subjected to high mechanical stresses because of the high operation speed. To make the rotor mechanically resistant in large turbo-alternators, the rotor is normally forged from solid [[steel]] and alloys like chromium-nickel-steel or chromium-nickel-molybdenum are used. The overhang of windings at the periphery will be secured by steel retaining rings. Heavy non-magnetic metal wedges on top of the slots hold the field windings against centrifugal forces. Hard composition insulating materials, like [[mica]] and [[asbestos]], are normally used in the slots of rotor. These material can withstand high temperatures and high crushing forces.&lt;ref name="Basic Electrical Engineering (Be 104) p. 8.3"&gt;{{cite book | title=Basic Electrical Engineering (Be 104) | publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Limited | isbn=978-1-259-08116-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtoM4dbYvE0C&amp;pg=SA8-PA1 | access-date=8 August 2017 | page=8.3 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211234348/https://books.google.com/books?id=LtoM4dbYvE0C&amp;pg=SA8-PA1 | archivedate=11 February 2018 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stator of large turbo generators may be built of two or more parts while in smaller turbo-generators it is built up in one complete piece.&lt;ref name="Basic Electrical Engineering (Be 104) p. 8.4"&gt;{{cite book | title=Basic Electrical Engineering (Be 104) | publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Limited | isbn=978-1-259-08116-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtoM4dbYvE0C&amp;pg=SA8-PA1 | access-date=8 August 2017 | page=8.4 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211234348/https://books.google.com/books?id=LtoM4dbYvE0C&amp;pg=SA8-PA1 | archivedate=11 February 2018 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogen-cooled turbo generator==
{{Main|Hydrogen-cooled turbo generator}}
Based on the air-cooled turbo generator, gaseous [[hydrogen]] first went into service as the [[coolant]] in a [[hydrogen-cooled turbo generator]] in October 1937, at  the [[Dayton Power &amp; Light]] Co. in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/chronologicalhis00natirich|title=A chronological history of electrical development from 600 B.C.|first=|last=National Electrical Manufacturers Association|date=11 February 2018|publisher=New York, N.Y., National Electrical Manufacturers Association|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen is used as the coolant in the rotor and sometimes the [[stator]], allowing an increase in specific utilization and a 99.0% efficiency. Because of the high [[thermal conductivity]], high [[specific heat]] and low [[density]] of hydrogen gas, this is the most common type in its field today. The hydrogen can be manufactured on-site by [[electrolysis]].

The generator is hermetically sealed to prevent escape of the hydrogen gas. The absence of [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere within significantly reduces the damage of the windings insulation by eventual [[corona discharge]]s. The hydrogen gas is circulated within the rotor enclosure, and cooled by a gas-to-water [[heat exchanger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gepower.com/prod_serv/products/generators/en/hydrogen_cool.htm|title=Aeroderivative &amp; Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines - GE Power|website=www.gepower.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505085646/http://www.gepower.com/prod_serv/products/generators/en/hydrogen_cool.htm|archivedate=2010-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) ===
Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.

Fossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the controversially claimed global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.

ETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url =https://www.bowmanpower.com/products/what-is-etc/| title =What is ETC| accessdate =2018-02-08| authorlink =| date =| year =| month =| work =| publisher =Bowman Power| pages =| language =| quote =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20180211234348/https://www.bowmanpower.com/products/what-is-etc/| dead-url =no| archivedate =2018-02-11| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Advantages of using ETC ====
* Helps developing economies with unreliable or insufficient power infrastructure. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url =http://www4.dcu.ie/sites/default/files/conference_sbc/Ian%20Briggs_Queens.pdf| title =Modelling a Turbogenerator for Waste Heat Recover on a Diesel-Electric Hybrid Bus| accessdate =2018-02-08| authorlink =| date =| year =| month =| work =| publisher =Ian Briggs| pages =| language =| quote =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170516171756/http://www4.dcu.ie/sites/default/files/conference_sbc/Ian%20Briggs_Queens.pdf| dead-url =no| archivedate =2017-05-16| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gives independent power providers (IPPs), power rental companies and generator OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) a competitive advantage and potential increased market share.
* Improves overall efficiency of the genset, including fuel input costs and helping end-users reduce amount of fuel burned. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url =https://www.kenyaengineer.co.ke/electric-turbo-compounding-helping-make-distributed-power-systems-more-efficient/| title =Electric Turbo-Compounding: Helping make distributed power systems more efficient| accessdate =2018-02-08| authorlink =| date =| year =| month =| work =| publisher =Kenya Engineer| pages =| language =| quote =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20180209002903/https://www.kenyaengineer.co.ke/electric-turbo-compounding-helping-make-distributed-power-systems-more-efficient/| dead-url =no| archivedate =2018-02-09| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Typically 4-7% less fuel consumption for both diesel and gas gensets. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url =https://www.bowmanpower.com/benefits/less-fuel/| title =Less Fuel, Reduced CO2| accessdate =2018-02-08| authorlink =| date =| year =| month =| work =| publisher =Bowman Power| pages =| language =| quote =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20180211234348/https://www.bowmanpower.com/benefits/less-fuel/| dead-url =no| archivedate =2018-02-11| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fewer carbon emissions.
* Increased power density. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url =https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/03/f9/2005_deer_vuk.pdf| title =Turbo Compounding, A Technology Who’s Time Has Come| accessdate =2018-02-08| authorlink =| date =| year =| month =| work =| publisher =Carl T.

* Capability to increase power output and capacity, with improved fuel efficiency.
* ETC system integration offers a step change in efficiency without increasing service or maintenance requirements.
* The cost of generating power through waste heat recovery is substantially less than burning more fuel, even with low diesel prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url =https://www.bowmanpower.com/benefits/competitive-advantage| title =Competitive Advantage| accessdate =2018-02-08| authorlink =| date =| year =| month =| work =| publisher =Bowman Power| pages =| language =| quote =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20180211234351/https://www.bowmanpower.com/benefits/competitive-advantage/| dead-url =no| archivedate =2018-02-11| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket''' ('''VASIMR''') is an [[Plasma propulsion engine|electromagnetic thruster]] under development for possible use in [[spacecraft propulsion]]. It uses [[radio wave]]s to [[ionization|ionize]] and heat a [[propellant]]. Then a [[magnetic field]] accelerates the resulting [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] to generate [[thrust]] ([[plasma propulsion engine]]). It is one of several types of spacecraft [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] systems.

The VASIMR method for heating [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] was originally developed from [[nuclear fusion]] research. It is intended to bridge the gap between high-[[thrust]], low-[[specific impulse]] and low-thrust, high-specific impulse systems, and is capable of functioning in either mode. Former NASA astronaut [[Franklin Chang Díaz]] created the VASIMR concept and has been developing it since 1977.&lt;ref name="seed"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/a_rocket_for_the_21st_century/ |title=A Rocket for the 21st Century |journal=[[Seed (magazine)|Seed]] |first=Lee |last=Billings |date=September 29, 2009 |accessdate=September 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VASIMRs units for development and test are assembled by [[Ad Astra Rocket Company]] in [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref name="Ad_Astra"&gt;{{cite web |title=About us |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/aarc/about-us |publisher=Ad Astra Rocket Company |accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VASIMR, sometimes referred to as the Electro-thermal Plasma Thruster or Electro-thermal Magnetoplasma Rocket, uses radio waves&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/plant/features/industry/article.jsp?content=20100513_153743_3324 |title=Nautel's space oddity (RF generator for Ad Astra) |date=May 13, 2010 |author=Noelle Stapinsky |publisher=Canadian Manufacturing |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

This engine is electrodeless, of the same [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] family as the [[electrodeless plasma thruster]], the microwave arcjet, or the [[pulsed inductive thruster]] class. It can be  thought of  as an electrodeless version of an [[arcjet rocket]] that can reach higher propellant temperature by limiting the heat flux from the plasma to the structure. Neither type of engine uses [[electrode]]s; this eliminates the electrode erosion that shortens the  life of other [[ion thruster]] designs. Since every part of a VASIMR engine is [[Magnetic mirror#Magnetic bottles|magnetically shielded]] and does not directly contact plasma, the durability of this engine is predicted to be greater than many other ion/plasma engines.&lt;ref name="seed"/&gt;

VASIMR has been described as a convergent-divergent nozzle for ions and electrons. The propellant (a neutral gas such as [[argon]] or [[xenon]]) is injected into a hollow cylinder surfaced with electromagnets. On entering the engine, the gas is first heated to a “cold plasma” by a helicon RF antenna (also known as a “coupler”) that bombards the gas with electromagnetic waves, stripping electrons off the propellant atoms and producing a plasma of ions and loose electrons that flow down the engine compartment. By varying the amount of energy dedicated to RF heating and the amount of propellant delivered for plasma generation, VASIMR is capable of generating either low-thrust, high–specific impulse exhaust or relatively high-thrust, low–specific impulse exhaust.&lt;ref name="Principal VASIMR results"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/TimSTAIF2005.pdf |title=Principal VASIMR Results and Present Objectives |journal=Space Technology and Applications International Forum - Staif 2005 |volume=746 |pages=976-982 |date=February 13–17, 2005 |author=Tim W. Glover |display-authors=etal |accessdate=February 27, 2010 |bibcode=2005AIPC..746..976G |doi=10.1063/1.1867222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase of the engine is a strong electromagnet positioned to compress the ionized plasma in a similar fashion to a convergent-divergent nozzle that compresses gas in traditional rocket engines.

A second coupler, known as the Ion Cyclotron Heating (ICH) section, emits electromagnetic waves in resonance with the orbits of ions and electrons as they travel through the engine. Resonance is achieved through a reduction of the magnetic field in this portion of the engine that slows the orbital motion of the plasma particles. This section further heats the plasma to greater than 1,000,000&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]]—about 173 times the temperature of the [[Sun]]’s surface.&lt;ref name="Air_March_2004"&gt;{{cite news|author=Beth Dickey|title=Star Power|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space/star-power-6700758|accessdate=February 7, 2014|newspaper=Air &amp; Space, Smithsonian|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The path of ions and electrons through the engine approximates lines parallel to the engine walls; however, the particles actually orbit those lines while traveling linearly through the engine. The final, diverging, section of the engine contains an expanding magnetic field that drives the ions and electrons in steadily expanding spirals and ejects them from the engine, parallel and opposite to the direction of motion at velocities as great as 50,000&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref name="Principal VASIMR results"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VASIMR-Technology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/aarc/Technology |title=Technology |date=2009 |author=Ad Astra Rocket Company |publisher=Ad Astra Rocket Company |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages and drawbacks ===
In contrast to the typical [[cyclotron resonance]] heating processes, VASIMR ions are immediately ejected from the magnetic nozzle before they achieve [[Thermalisation|thermalized distribution]]. Based on novel theoretical work in 2004 by Alexey V. Arefiev and Boris N. Breizman of [[University of Texas at Austin]], virtually all of the energy in the ion [[cyclotron]] wave is uniformly transferred to ionized plasma in a single-pass cyclotron absorption process. This allows for ions to leave the magnetic nozzle with a very narrow energy distribution, and for significantly simplified and compact magnet arrangement in the engine.&lt;ref name="Principal VASIMR results"/&gt;

VASIMR does not use electrodes; instead, it magnetically shields plasma from most hardware parts, thus eliminating electrode erosion, a major source of wear in ion engines.&lt;ref name=Engine_2003&gt;{{cite web|display-authors=7|author=Jared P. Squire|author2=Franklin R. Chang Díaz|author3=Verlin T. Jacobson|author4=Tim W. Glover|author5=F. Wally Baity|author6=Richard H. Goulding|author7=Roger Bengtson|author8=Edgar A.

However, new problems emerge, such as interaction with strong magnetic fields and thermal management. The relatively large power at which VASIMR operates generates substantial [[waste heat]] that needs to be channeled away without creating thermal overload and thermal stress. Powerful [[superconducting magnet|superconducting electromagnets]], necessary to contain hot plasma, generate [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]]-range magnetic fields&lt;ref name="VASIMR Exceeding 50kW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/ISGLP_JPSquire2008.pdf |title=VASIMR Performance Measurements at Powers Exceeding 50 kW and Lunar Robotic Mission Applications |date=September 5–6, 2008 |author=Jared P. Squire |display-authors=etal |publisher=International Interdisciplinary Symposium on Gaseous and Liquid Plasmas |accessdate=February 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that can cause problems with other onboard devices and produce unwanted torque by interaction with the [[magnetosphere]]. To counter this latter effect, the VF-200 consists of two 100&amp;nbsp;kW thruster units packaged with magnetic fields oriented in opposite directions, making a net zero-torque magnetic [[quadrupole]].&lt;ref name=aarc20110208/&gt;

== Research and development ==
[[Image:VASIMR test.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The testing vacuum chamber, containing the 50&amp;nbsp;kW VASIMR, operated in ASPL in 2005–2006]]
The first VASIMR experiment was conducted at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1983 on the [[magnetic mirror]] plasma device.  Important refinements were introduced to the rocket concept in the 1990s, including the use of the "helicon" plasma source, which replaced the plasma gun originally envisioned and made the rocket completely "electrodeless"—adding to durability and long life. A new [[patent]] was granted in 2002.

In 1995, the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory (ASPL) was founded at [[NASA]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]], in the [[Sonny Carter Training Facility]]. The [[magnetic mirror]] device was brought from MIT. The first plasma experiment in Houston was conducted with a [[microwave]] plasma source. Collaboration was established with [[University of Houston]], [[University of Texas at Austin|UT-Austin]], [[Rice University]] and other academic institutions.

In 1998, the first helicon plasma experiment was performed at the ASPL. VASIMR experiment (VX) 10 in 1998 achieved a helicon RF plasma discharge as great as 10&amp;nbsp;kW, VX-25 in 2002 as great as 25&amp;nbsp;kW, and VX-50 as great as 50&amp;nbsp;kW. In March 2000, the VASIMR group was given a Rotary National Award for Space Achievement/Stellar Award. By 2005 breakthroughs were obtained at ASPL including full/efficient plasma production and acceleration of the plasma ions.  VX-50 proved capable of {{convert|0.5|N|lbf|1}} of thrust.&lt;ref name="IEPC-2007-181"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/Jared_IEPC07.pdf |title=High Power VASIMR Experiments using Deuterium, Neon and Argon |date=September 17–20, 2007 |first1=Jared P |last1=Squire |display-authors=etal  |publisher=International Electric Propulsion Conference 2007|accessdate=February 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Published data on VX-50, capable of 50&amp;nbsp;kW of total radio frequency power, showed ICRF (second stage) efficiency to be 59% calculated by 90% ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; coupling efficiency × 65% ''N''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; ion speed boosting efficiency.&lt;ref name="IEPC-2007-181"/&gt;

[[Ad Astra Rocket Company]] (AARC) was incorporated on January 14, 2005. On June 23, 2005, Ad Astra and NASA signed the first [[Space Act Agreement]] to privatize VASIMR Technology.&lt;ref name="summary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/EXECUTIVE%20SUMMARY240110.pdf |title=Executive summary |date=January 24, 2010 |publisher=Ad Astra Rocket Company |accessdate=February 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331171616/http://www.adastrarocket.com/EXECUTIVE%20SUMMARY240110.pdf |archivedate=March 31, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 8, 2005, [[Franklin Chang Díaz|Díaz]] retired from NASA after 25 years. Ad Astra’s Board of Directors was formed and Díaz became chairman and CEO on July 15, 2005. In July 2006, AARC opened its Costa Rica subsidiary in [[Liberia, Costa Rica|Liberia]] on the campus of [[EARTH University|Earth University]]. In December 2006, AARC-Costa Rica performed its first plasma experiment on the VX-CR device, using helicon ionization of argon.

The 100 kilowatt VASIMR experiment was successfully running by 2007 and demonstrated efficient plasma production with an ionization cost below 100{{nbsp}}eV.&lt;ref name=PR_June_2007&gt;{{cite web|title=Ad Astra's VX-100 test bed achieves record plasma performance|url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/AdAstraPressRelease061207-1.pdf|website=PRESS RELEASE 061207, June 12, 2007|publisher=Ad Astra|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; VX-100 plasma output tripled the prior record of the VX-50.&lt;ref name=PR_June_2007/&gt;

=== 200 kW engine ===
On October 24, 2008 the company announced that the plasma generation component of the VX-200 engine—[[Helicon (physics)|helicon]] first stage or solid-state high frequency power transmitter—had reached operational status. The key enabling technology, solid-state DC-RF power-processing, reached 98% efficiency.  The helicon discharge used 30&amp;nbsp;kW of radio waves to turn [[argon]] gas into plasma. The remaining 170&amp;nbsp;kW of power was allocated for acceleration of plasma in the second part of the engine, via ion cyclotron resonance heating.&lt;ref name="VASIMR VX-200 first stage"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/Release241008.pdf |title=VASIMR VX-200 first stage achieves full power rating |publisher=Ad Astra Rocket Company |date=October 24, 2008 |accessdate=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on data from VX-100 testing,&lt;ref name="VASIMR Exceeding 50kW"/&gt; it was expected that the VX-200 engine would have a system efficiency of 60–65% and thrust level of 5&amp;nbsp;N. Optimal [[specific impulse]] appeared to be around 5,000&amp;nbsp;s using low cost argon propellant. One of the remaining untested issues was potential vs actual thrust—whether the hot plasma actually detached from the rocket. Another issue was waste heat management. About 60% of input energy became useful kinetic energy. Much of the remaining 40% is secondary ionizations from plasma crossing magnetic field lines and exhaust divergence. A significant portion of that 40% was waste heat (see [[energy conversion efficiency]]). Managing and rejecting that waste heat is critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A review of the processing, composition, and temperature-dependent mechanical and thermal properties of dielectric technical ceramics |journal=Journal of Materials Science |volume = 47|issue=10 |pages=4211–4235 |first1=Daithí |last1=de Faoite |first2=David J |last2=Browne |first3=Franklin R |last3=Chang-Díaz |first4=Kenneth T |last4=Stanton |date=November 17, 2011 |doi=10.1007/s10853-011-6140-1|bibcode = 2012JMatS..47.4211F |hdl=10197/8477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VX-200 operation full power.jpg|thumb|300px|VX-200 plasma engine at full power, employing both stages with full magnetic field]]
Between April and September 2009, tests were performed on the VX-200 prototype with integrated 2-[[tesla (unit)|tesla]] superconducting magnets. They expanded the power range of the VASIMR to its operational capability of 200&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/Release_200kW_01Oct2009Final.pdf |title=VASIMR VX-200 reaches 200&amp;nbsp;kW power milestone |publisher=Ad Astra Rocket Company |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During November 2010, long duration, full power firing tests were performed, reaching steady state operation for 25 seconds and validating basic design characteristics.&lt;ref name="VASIMR VX-200 firing for 25 seconds"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRS26DcQhq0 |title=Video of VASIMR VX-200 firing for 25 seconds at full power rating |date=December 15, 2010 |author=Benwl |publisher=Ad Astra Rocket Company |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results presented in January 2011 confirmed that the design point for optimal efficiency on the VX-200 is 50&amp;nbsp;km/s exhaust velocity, or an [[specific impulse|''I''{{sub|sp}}]] of 5000{{nbsp}}s.

===== NASA partnership =====
In June 2005, Ad Astra signed its first Space Act Agreement with NASA, which led to the development of the VASIMR engine.

The lab prototype has exceeded thruster output by a factor of two over the requirements set for the ISS version.|accessdate=February 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102152209/http://www.hobbyspace.com/nucleus/index.php?itemid=27038|archivedate=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 16, 2013, AARC and NASA signed another five-year Umbrella Space Act Agreement.&lt;ref name="aarc20131219"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Ad Astra Rocket Company and NASA Sign New Agreements on VASIMR Development|date=December 19, 2013|publisher=Ad Astra|url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/AdAstraRelease191213.pdf|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2015 NASA ended plans for flying the VF-200 to the ISS. A NASA spokesperson stated that the ISS "was not an ideal demonstration platform for the desired performance level of the engines". Ad Astra stated that tests of a VASIMR thruster on the ISS would remain an option after a future in-space demonstration.&lt;ref name="scrapped"&gt;[http://sen.com/blogs/irene-klotz/nasa-nixes-ad-astra-rocket-test-on-the-space-station NASA nixes Ad Astra rocket test on the space station]. ''SEN News'', Irene Klotz. 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Work with NASA continued in 2015 under NASA's NextSTEP program with planning for a 100-hour vacuum chamber test of the VX-200SSTM thruster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=46574 Ad Astra Rocket Company and NASA move to execution phase of NextSTEP VASIMR partnership] spaceref.com&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Do we need the hypothetical launch dates for something that possibly will never fly???
In early 2009, the earliest possible launch date was reported as 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2009-02-20/news/25282105_1_space-program-shuttle-mission-international-space-station|title=Recycling urine among space feats An alumnus astronaut details adventures|last=Avril|first=Tom|date=20 February 2009|publisher=philly.com|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2014|04}}, its launch was anticipated to be in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2014/may/12-rocketman|title=The Revolutionary Rocket That Could Shuttle Humans to Mars|last=Nadis|first=Steve|date=18 April 2014|publisher=Discover magazine|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the delays in the project were attributed to funding; and in June 2014, Franklin Chang-Diaz stated that the project would be unlikely to proceed unless Ad Astra were to receive Space Act Agreement (SAA) funds from NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awin.aviationweek.com/portals/awin/cmsfiles/media/pdf/as_pdf/2014/06/19/asd_06_19_2014.pdf |title=Ad Astra's Commercial Propulsion Ambitions Stall |last=Carreau| first=Mark| date=June 2014| page=3| publisher=Aviation Week| accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Since the available power from the ISS is less than 200&amp;nbsp;kW, the ISS VASIMR would have included a trickle-charged battery system, allowing for 15-minute pulses of thrust. Testing of the engine on the ISS would have been valuable, because it orbits at a relatively [[low Earth orbit|low altitude]] and experiences fairly high levels of [[atmospheric drag]], making [[Orbital station-keeping|periodic boosts of altitude]] necessary. Currently, altitude reboosting by chemical rockets fulfills this requirement. The VASIMR test on the ISS might lead to a capability of maintaining the ISS, or a similar space station, in a stable orbit at 1/20th of the approximately $210 million/year present estimated cost.&lt;ref name="summary" /&gt;

===== VX-200SS =====
In March 2015, Ad Astra announced the award of a $10 million award from NASA to advance the technology readiness of the next version of the VASIMR engine, the '''VX-200SS''' (SS stands for steady state) to meet the needs of deep space missions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adastrarocket.com/AdAstraRelease033115final.pdf AD ASTRA ROCKET COMPANY WINS MAJOR NASA ADVANCED PROPULSION CONTRACT].

March 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Ad Astra announced  completion of the milestones for the first year of its 3-year contract with NASA. This will allow first high-power plasma firings of the engines, with a stated goal to reach 100{{nbsp}}hr and 100&amp;nbsp;kW by mid-2018.&lt;ref&gt;[adastrarocket.com/pressReleases/AdAstra-Release-080316-final.pdf AD ASTRA ROCKET COMPANY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES ALL NASA NEXTSTEP CONTRACT MILESTONES FOR YEAR ONE, RECEIVES NASA APPROVAL TO PROCEED WITH YEAR TWO.].

== Potential applications ==
VASIMR is not suitable to launch payloads from the Earth's surface because it has a low thrust-to-weight ratio and requires an ambient vacuum. Instead, the engine would function as an upper stage for cargo, reducing fuel requirements for in-space transport. The engine is anticipated to perform the following functions at a fraction of the cost of chemical technologies: drag compensation for space stations, lunar cargo delivery, satellite repositioning, satellite refueling, maintenance and repair, in space resource recovery, and deep space robotic missions.

Other applications for VASIMR such as the rapid transportation of people to Mars would require a very high power, low mass energy source, such as a nuclear reactor (see [[nuclear electric rocket]]). In 2010 NASA Administrator [[Charles Bolden]] said that VASIMR technology could be the breakthrough technology that would reduce the travel time on a Mars mission from 2.5 years to 5 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morring |first1=Frank |date=2010 |title=Commercial Route |journal=Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology |volume=172 |issue=6 |pages=20–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, Tim Glover, Ad Astra director of development, publicly stated that the first expected application of VASIMR engine is "hauling things [non-human cargo] from low-Earth orbit to low-lunar orbit" supporting NASA's return to Moon efforts.&lt;ref name="Discovery News"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/08/07/plasma-rocket.html |title=Plasma Rocket May Be Tested at Space Station |date=August 7, 2008 |author=Irene Klotz |publisher=Discovery News |accessdate=February 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space tug/orbital transfer vehicle ===
The most important near-term application of VASIMR-powered spacecraft is cargo transport. Studies have shown that, despite longer transit times, VASIMR-powered spacecraft will be much more efficient than traditional integrated chemical rockets when moving goods through space. An [[orbital transfer vehicle]] (OTV)—essentially a "space tug"—powered by a single VF-200 engine would be capable of transporting about 7 metric tons of cargo from [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) to low Lunar orbit (LLO) with about a six-month transit time.

NASA envisions delivering about 34 metric tons of useful cargo to LLO in a single flight with a chemically propelled vehicle. To make that trip, about 60 metric tons of LOX-LH2 propellant would be expended. A comparable OTV would employ 5 VF-200 engines powered by a 1 MW solar array. To do the same job, a VASIMR-powered  OTV would need to expend only about 8 metric tons of argon propellant. The total mass of such an electric OTV would be in the range of 49&amp;nbsp;t (outbound &amp; return fuel: 9&amp;nbsp;t, hardware: 6&amp;nbsp;t, cargo 34&amp;nbsp;t).

OTV transit times can be reduced by carrying lighter loads and/or expending more argon propellant with VASIMR throttled up to higher thrust at less efficient (lower ''I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;'') operating conditions. For instance, an empty OTV on the return trip to Earth covers the distance in about 23 days at optimal specific impulse of 5,000&amp;nbsp;s (50&amp;nbsp;kN·s/kg) or in about 14 days at ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; of 3,000&amp;nbsp;s (30&amp;nbsp;kN·s/kg). The total mass of the NASA specifications' OTV (including structure, solar array, fuel tank, avionics, propellant and cargo) was assumed to be 100 metric tons (98.4 [[long tons]]; 110 [[short tons]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/Tim_IEPC07.pdf |title=Projected Lunar Cargo Capabilities of High-Power VASIMR Propulsion |date=September 17–20, 2007 |author=Tim W. Glover |display-authors=etal |publisher=International Electric Propulsion Conference |accessdate=February 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing almost double the cargo capacity compared to chemically propelled vehicles but requiring even bigger solar arrays (or other source of power) capable of providing 2&amp;nbsp;MW.

{{As of|October 2010}}, [[Ad Astra Rocket Company]] was targeting [[Unmanned resupply spacecraft|space tug]] missions to help "clean up the ever-growing problem of [[space trash]]". As of 2016 no such commercial product had reached the market.

=== Mars in 39 days ===

However, the vehicle might be better served with non-moving parts and non-steam based power conversion using a [[thermocell]] technology of the [[thermoelectrics|thermoelectric]] (including [[graphene]]-based thermal power conversion&lt;ref&gt;Technology Review, March 5, 2012: ''[http://www.technologyreview.com/view/427140/graphene-battery-turns-ambient-heat-into-electric-current/ Graphene Battery Turns Ambient Heat Into Electric Current]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Reports, Aug. 22, 2012: ''[http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130311/srep01383/full/srep01383.html Graphene-based photovoltaic cells for near-field thermal energy conversion]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MIT News, Oct. 7, 2011: ''[http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2011/graphene-thermoelectric-1007 Graphene shows unusual thermoelectric response to light]''&lt;/ref&gt;), [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]], [[thermophotovoltaic]], or [[thermionic converter|thermionic]] [[magnetohydrodynamic]] type. [[Thermoelectric materials]] are also an option for converting [[heat]] energy (being both [[black-body radiation]] and the kinetic thermal vibration of molecules and other particles) to electric current energy (electrons flowing through a circuit). Avoiding the need for "football-field sized radiators" ([[Robert Zubrin|Zubrin]] quote) for a "200,000 [[kilowatt]] (200 [[megawatt]]) reactor with a power-to-mass density of 1,000 [[watt]]s per [[kilogram]]" ([[Franklin Chang Díaz|Díaz]] quote)&lt;ref&gt;Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myYs4DCCZts#t=870s ''VASIMR Debate/The VASIMR Hoax – Dr. Robert Zubrin – 14th International Mars Society Convention'', Time Index 14:30]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More Discussion: [http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=21998 NASA Spaceflight Forum: ''Topic: Vasimr: A true game changer?

Ford-class aircraft carrier]] uses a 300 megawatt [[A1B reactor]].

== Zubrin criticisms ==
Mars manned mission advocate [[Robert Zubrin]]  has called VASIMR a [[hoax]], claiming that it is less efficient than other electric thrusters that are now operational. He also believes that electric propulsion is not necessary to get to Mars; therefore, budgets should not be assigned to develop it. His second critique concentrates on the lack of a suitable power source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/vasimr-hoax |date=July 13, 2011 |title=The VASIMR Hoax |first=Robert |last=Zubrin &lt;!-- same exact article: http://www.marssociety.org/home/press/tms-in-the-news/thevasimrhoax --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ad Astra responded in a press release:{{Quote|text=''In the near term, using solar-electric power at levels of 100 kW to 1 MW, VASIMR propulsion could transfer heavy payloads to Mars using only one to four first-generation thrusters in relatively simple engine architectures.''[...]

''It is abundantly clear that the nuclear reactor technology required for such missions ''[fast manned Mars transport]'' is not available today and major advances in reactor design and power conversion are needed.''|author=Ad Astra Rocket Company|title=Facts About the VASIMR Engine and its Development&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/VASIMR_development_AdAstra_15July2011.pdf |date=July 15, 2011 |title=Facts About the VASIMR® Engine and its Development |publisher=Ad Astra Rocket Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a response to VASIMR being labeled as a hoax by Zubrin, Ad Astra added a section to their [[FAQ]]: {{Quote|text=''It'' [the hoax claim] ''was made by an individual who never visited the MIT or NASA facilities where the research originated or the Ad Astra Rocket Company laboratories where the development continues and, despite an open invitation, has never bothered to see any of the prototypes being fired in the vacuum chamber and reviewed the copious amounts of calibrated and validated data available.

'''''Chernobyl Prayer: A Chronicle of the Future''''' (UK title) / '''''Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster''''' (US title) is a book by Nobel Laureate [[Svetlana Alexievich]].&lt;ref&gt; UK edition: ''Chernobyl Prayer: A Chronicle of the Future'', translated by Anna Gunin and Arch Tait (Penguin Modern Classics, 2016; {{ISBN|978-0241270530}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;; US edition:''Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of the Nuclear Disaster'', translated by Keith Gessen (Dalkey Archive Press, 2005; {{ISBN|1-56478-401-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexievich was a journalist living in [[Minsk]], the capital of [[Belarus]], in 1986 at the time of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. (At the time Belarus was part of the [[Soviet Union]] as the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]].) 

Alexievich interviewed more than 500 eyewitnesses, including firefighters, liquidators (members of the cleanup team), politicians, physicians, physicists and ordinary citizens over a period of 10 years. The book relates the psychological and personal [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]] of the Chernobyl accident, and explores the experiences of individuals and how the disaster affected their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/47/8/1389 Journal of Nuclear Medicine Vol. 47 No. 8 1389-1390]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chernobyl Prayer'' was first published in Russian in 1997 as ''Чернобыльская молитва'' and a revised, updated edition came out in 2013. The American translation was awarded the 2005 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for general non-fiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/ghistory/alexievs.htm  Voices from Chernobyl]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Volkswagen Golf Mk4'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deutsche Autos seit 1990, vol.5 |last=Kittler |first=Eberhard |year= 2001 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-02128-5 |pages=290–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or VW ''Type 1J'') is a [[compact car]], the fourth generation of the [[Volkswagen Golf]] and the successor to the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk3]]. Launched in October 1997, it was the best selling car in [[Europe]] in 2001 (though it slipped to second place, behind the [[Peugeot 206]], in 2002).&lt;ref name=AutoMotorundSport200221&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = Peter Frey (Bernd Ostmann - Ed)| title = Der böse Golf | journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]]| volume = Heft 21 2002| page = Page 188 |date = 2 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mk4 was a deliberate attempt to take the [[Volkswagen Golf]] series further upmarket, with a high-quality interior and higher equipment levels.

It was replaced in 2004 by the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5]] in European Markets. However, manufacturing continued in South America, Mexico and China for developing markets until 2010.

The Mk4 was sold in Japan, but starting with this generation and subsequent generations, it no longer complied with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which affected sales, imposing an annual tax on Japanese consumers for owning a vehicle that exceeded the maximum width limit.

==Design and engineering==

The Golf Mk4 was a significant car in its class.  As with its big brother the [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]], not only was it the first step of [[Volkswagen]] moving its products upmarket to plug a gap between the mainstream machines and the premium cars, with [[SEAT]] and [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] taking over as the mainstream in a new level of interior quality and sophistication never seen before from a mainstream brand in the class.  In fact, the quality of the Golf was on a par with its sister [[Audi A3]] from the year before, but cost considerably more than other cars in its class.

The latest model remained faithful to the Golf concept but included some of the new "arched" styling themes first seen on the B4 Passat.

==Golf Cabriolet==

[[File:2001 Volkswagen Golf (1E) GL 2.0 convertible (2011-01-13) 02.jpg|thumb|left|2000–2003 Golf Cabriolet (Australia)]]
As with the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk2|Mk2 Golf]], Volkswagen did not make a convertible version of the Mk4 Golf.  Instead, they face-lifted the front bumper, fenders, grille, and hood to resemble Mk4 Golf styling but to fit a Mk3 chassis. VW managed to incorporate some non-structural Mk4 parts as well such as fender repeaters, headlights, side mirror caps, rear license tag lights, 3-spoke steering wheel airbag, etc. The rear also received a redesigned bumper with the number plate tub moved from the hatch and a Mk4 handle with a larger VW emblem above it to resemble the rear of a Mk4 Golf. The interior largely remained the same as a Mk3 interior save for a Mk4 style 3-spoke leather steering wheel, a textured dashboard (also known as "dimpled dash" or "shark skin dash"), heavily bolstered front seats with incorporated side airbags, and the hazard switch relocated from the steering column to the instrument panel. The interior lighting in the cabin was switched to the blue and red hue found in the Mk4 and some of the more familiar Mk3 parts were chromed such as the inner door handles, emergency brake button, door strikers, front seat belt anchors, key lock cylinders, and shifter button in automatic transmission equipped cars. There are some technical carryovers, as well, the main one being the immobilizer and engine computer from the Mk4 Golf being used with the older Mk3 engine mechanicals.

Although the redesigned Golf Cabriolet looks like a Mk4 Golf, it is based on the Mk3 chassis and this causes a bit of confusion on how it should be designated. VW enthusiasts in Eastern Europe call it a Mk4 Golf Cabriolet while VW enthusiasts in the United Kingdom and United States call it a Mk3.5 Cabrio.

==Variant==
[[File:VW Golf IV Variant 20090910 rear.JPG|thumb|left|Volkswagen Golf Variant (Mk4)]]

The Volkswagen Golf Mk4 Variant was introduced in 1999. It was discontinued in 2006, and succeeded in 2007 by the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5]] Variant. Unlike the Mk3, it was offered in [[North America]] with the "Jetta" name and front sheet metal were used. The "JETTA WAGON" was used in North America instead of the "BORA" name.

==Volkswagen Bora/Jetta Mk4==
{{Main|Volkswagen Jetta}}
Volkswagen produced a saloon version of the Mk4 Golf. As with previous incarnations of the Golf, it had its own identity, and this time was called the [[Volkswagen Bora]] although the name Jetta remained in North America and South Africa. Unlike its predecessors, the Bora/Jetta featured unique rear doors, front wings and bonnet. The front doors were the only body panels it shared with the Golf. The interior, though, was almost identical to the Golf, featuring very minor styling changes like its predecessor.
[[File:VW Jetta sedan.jpg|thumb|left|Volkswagen Jetta]]

[[Germany]], [[South Africa]], [[Slovakia]], [[Brazil]], [[Belgium]], and [[China]] all made the Golf 4. Eastern European locations making the Golf 4 included [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], in [[Vogošća]] (near [[Sarajevo]]), which also made [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|Mk1]] and [[Volkswagen Golf Mk2|Mk2]] models.  However, although the Bosnian Mk4 was popular it was only available in the local market.

The Golf/Jetta Mk4 engine choices included 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.3 &amp;nbsp;litre [[VR5 engine|VR5]], 2.8 &amp;nbsp;litre [[V6]] and 3.2 &amp;nbsp;litre R32 petrol engines, 1.9-litre naturally aspirated diesel SDI engine, and a 1.9-litre turbodiesel, with power ranging from 90 to 150 PS (66 to 110&amp;nbsp;kW).

Volkswagen made a choice of three and five-door hatchback or a five-door station wagon available.  The European Golf wagon was nearly identical to the North American Jetta Wagon.  The only difference was the use of the Golf front headlights, bumpers, grille, hood, and fenders as these parts are interchangeable between the Mk4 Golf and Bora/Jetta.

The Golf 4 was introduced to North America in mid-1999. Available engines for the Golf at its introduction to the American market were a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L gasoline engine, and a thrifty (48mpg) 1.9&amp;nbsp;L [[Turbo Direct Injection|TDI]] engine.  The latter soon developed a reputation for good low-speed torque and fuel economy, and can operate on alternative biofuels.  In 2004 the updated 1.9L TDI PD or "Pumpe-Düse" engine was installed in the Golf and Jetta.  The "Pumpe-Düse" or Pump Nozzle was a Robert Bosch extreme high pressure fuel injection system for direct cylinder injection.  A 1.8&amp;nbsp;L turbocharged gas engine was introduced in 2000, along with the 12-valve 2.8&amp;nbsp;L VR6. At the same time, the 1.6&amp;nbsp;L 8-valve unit was replaced with the 16-valve unit from the [[Volkswagen Polo GTI|Polo GTI]], but detuned to 77&amp;nbsp;kW (105 PS). The 2.0&amp;nbsp;L gasoline engine was the base engine in the sportier GTI only as a 1999.5 model.  For 2000, Volkswagen opted for the relatively new 1.8&amp;nbsp;L turbocharged gasoline engine as a base engine for the GTI.  The top-of-the-line GLX model was equipped with Volkswagen's torquey 2.8&amp;nbsp;L [[VR6]], which put out an impressive {{Convert|174|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The VR6 engine, with its narrow 15-degree Vee design, was unique to Volkswagen.  This engine is shorter and lighter (featuring a single cylinder head) than other [[V6]] engines which benefits the handling characteristics of this front-wheel drive car.  For the 2002.5 model year Volkswagen introduced a 24-valve version of its VR6 engine to the North American market under engine code BDE.  This engine had the same torque characteristics of the older 12-valve version which had been carried over from the Mk3 Golf under engine codes AAA and AFP. The 24-valve version gained an extra {{Convert|26|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} over the 12-valve to reach 204BHP. In Europe, the VR6-engined V6 4Motion variant was produced from 1999 with 204BHP and a 24-valve engine from the outset, using engine codes AUE and AQP. In 2002, the European market began using the BDE-code engine at the same time as the North American market. This had the same 204BHP power output but now featured variable valve timing on the exhaust valves which allowed the engine to rev more freely in the higher ranges and now had "coil-on-plug" ignition coils. The 1.8T and VR6 models continued until 2005, when the Mk4 platform came to an end in North America. Both the Mk4 Golf and the Mk4 Jetta are still in production in Brazil, Mexico, and China as of 2008.

The Brazilian Golf TDI PD was sold in Canada due to its popularity as a full 2006 models in base, GL and GLS trim levels for the full model year as there were no diesel engine versions for the North American 2007 [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Mk5]] Golf (Rabbit).

In Europe, trim levels were country-specific, although the [[United Kingdom]] got E, S, SE, GTI and V5/V6/V6 4MOTION versions.  The V5 was available in 150&amp;nbsp;bhp/110&amp;nbsp;kW (1997-2000) and 170&amp;nbsp;bhp/125&amp;nbsp;kW (1999-2003) versions.

==GTI 25th Anniversary Edition (2002)==
[[File:VW GTI 337.jpg|Volkswagen GTI 337 Edition|thumb]]
The ''GTI 25th Anniversary Edition'' was a special version of the Golf GTI, for the [[European Economic Area|European Market]] to commemorate the first GTI, launched in 1976. This model had three paint colour options: Tornado Red, Reflex Silver &amp; Diamond Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doppel-wobber.de/wbb2/Modell_480_VW-Golf-GTI-25-Jahre.html |title=GTI 25 Jahre |publisher=Doppel-wobber.de |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its launch, it wasn't confirmed whether Volkswagen was going to sell this special edition model in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=**TIME AGO** |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/buying_guide/volkswagen/gti/volkswagen_golf_gti_25th_anniversary_edition_short_take_road_test |title=Volkswagen Golf GTI 25th-Anniversary Edition - Short Take Road Test - Auto Reviews |publisher=Car and Driver |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similarly equipped version of the GTI, called the '''GTI 337 Edition''', was officially introduced at the [[New York Auto Show]] and made it to dealers late May 2002 to the US &amp; Canadian markets. The price of the GTI 337 was $22,225 in the U.S. and $32,900 in Canada.  Only 1,500 units were produced for the US market with an additional 250&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.vwvortex.com/zerothread?&amp;id=1029415&amp;postid=9696602#9696602 |title=VWvortex Forums: The "Official" DIY/FAQ 337/20th AE/Jetta GLI Thread |publisher=Forums.vwvortex.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Canadian market.  This model came painted exclusively in metallic Reflex Silver.
Both the GTI 25th anniversary and the 337 editions were equipped with many extra features not included in the standard GTI.  They included: 18x7.5" [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG|BBS]] RC Wheels with special ball peen finish, perforated leather shift boot and handbrake, red and black seat belts, Red and Black upholstered [[Recaro]] seats, factory body kit (front valance, sideskirts, hatch spoiler, and rear valance), 02M 6-speed [[manual transmission]], larger front brakes (312mm) with Red Calipers, lowered sport tuned suspension, and brushed aluminum interior trim.  These models were never equipped with a [[sunroof]] as to take the car back to its roots, the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|Mk1 GTI]], and improve handling and performance. However, one instance of the 337 edition is known to have been special ordered with a sunroof.

==GTI 20th Anniversary Edition - US Market (2003)==
[[File:20th GTI PF.jpg|Volkswagen GTI 20th Anniversary Edition|thumb|left]]
Following the initial commemorative anniversary edition GTI produced in Europe in 1996 celebrating the introduction of the GTI model in 1976, and the overwhelming popularity of the 25th anniversary edition GTI produced 2001 (released as the GTI 337 in North America in 2002), [[Volkswagen of America]] produced 4,200 "20th Anniversary Edition" GTIs for 2003; 4,000 were shipped to the United States and 200 to Canada. This marked the 20th anniversary of the GTI's 1983 introduction to the U.S. and Canadian market, some 7 years after the GTI was introduced to the European market. Several special features distinguish this new GTI from the rest of the pack, most of which were shared with the 337 of 2002.

On the outside, the 20th Anniversary edition came with throwback red-lettered GTI logos on the left front and right rear.  The rear was also accompanied by a vintage-look chrome rabbit.  Blackened headlights added a distinctive look, while Votex front, rear, and side skirts along with a hatch spoiler and special edition 18" [[OZ Group|OZ]] Aristo alloy wheels wrapped in [[Michelin]] Pilot Sports complete the exterior transformation. These models were produced in only three colours: Imola Yellow, Jazz Blue and Black Magic Pearl. Distribution of production was 50% Black magic pearl, 25% Jazz Blue and 25% Imola Yellow.
[[File:20th Interior.jpg|Volkswagen GTI 20th Anniversary Edition Interior|thumb|right]]

Inside, a few accents were noticeable. The only option was [[Electronic stability control|ESP]], Volkswagen's stability control feature. All 20ths had a sunroof, black headliner, golf ball shift knob, black leather steering wheel with silver stitching, black leather shifter boot with silver stitching, perforated leather covered hand brake handle, and sporty black cloth [[Recaro]] bucket seats with silver stitching accents and red GTI emblems embroidered in the middle of the back rests. Aluminum trim came standard, complete with a numbered nameplate above the radio identifying the exact production number (US production only) of the vehicle. Volkswagen's premium 8-speaker [[Monsoon (speakers)|Monsoon]] stereo system was also standard.

Mechanically, the 20th Anniversary Edition GTI is nearly identical to the GTI 337 Edition. A 6-speed manual 02M transmission marked the most notable departure from the norm, and upgraded suspension stiffened up the ride and lowered the car approximately 30&amp;nbsp;mm. Upgraded [[disc brake]]s front (12.3" vented rotors) and rear (10.3" vented rotors) helped bring things to a stop, while red powder-coated calipers added a bit of flair to the package.

Starting in 2002 with engine code AWP, all of the models of the GTI's 1.8T increased in factory boost pressure and [[horsepower]] from {{convert|150|bhp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|180|bhp|abbr=on}}and had a quick 0-60 of 6.4 seconds. The 20th Anniversary GTI was not available with the VR6 engine.

==R32 (2004){{anchor|R32}}==
[[File:VW Golf IV R32 20090916 front.jpg|European-spec R32|thumb|right]]
In 2002, Volkswagen produced the '''Golf R32''' in Europe as a 2003 [[model year]]. It was the world's first production car with a dual-clutch gearbox ([[Direct-Shift Gearbox|DSG]]) — available for the German market.&lt;ref name=VMS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/medias_publish/ms/content/en/pressemitteilungen/2002/11/22/volkswagen_dsg_-_world.standard.gid-oeffentlichkeit.html |title=Press Release: Volkswagen DSG - World's first dual-clutch gearbox in a production car |publisher=Volkswagen Media Services |date=22 November 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524093743/http://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/medias_publish/ms/content/en/pressemitteilungen/2002/11/22/volkswagen_dsg_-_world.standard.gid-oeffentlichkeit.html |archivedate=May 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to unexpected popularity, Volkswagen decided to sell the car in the [[United States]] and [[Australia]] as the 2004 model year Volkswagen R32. Billed as the pinnacle of the Golf IV platform, the R32 included every performance, safety, and luxury feature Volkswagen had to offer, including the all new {{convert|3189|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[multi-valve#Four-valve cylinder head|4 valve]]s per [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[VR6 engine]] (ID codes: BFH/BML), which produced a rated [[motive power|motive]] [[power (physics)|power]] output of {{convert|241|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 6250 rpm and {{convert|320|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 rpm of [[torque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=101596|website=carfolio.com|title=2002 Volkswagen Golf R32 Golf 4|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further additions included [[Haldex Traction]]-based [[4motion]] on-demand [[four-wheel drive]] system, a new six-speed [[manual transmission]], [[independent rear suspension]], Climatronic automatic climate control, sport seats from König with R32 badging, 18" [[OZ Group|OZ]] Aristo [[alloy wheel]]s ([[Ronal]] produced the wheels towards the end of production), [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]], larger {{convert|334|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[disc brake]]s with gloss blue painted calipers, [[sunroof]] (for the US), Xenon Headlamps (for Europa), and model-specific bodywork additions.

For Australia, two hundred "Edition 200" cars were produced, each uniquely plaqued and available in three colours: Black Magic Pearl, Deep Blue Pearl and Reflex Silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billswebspace.com/OZR32flyer2.JPG|title=The New Volkswagen Golf R32|publisher=Volkswagen Group Australia|date=February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the US, Tornado Red was an available fourth colour. The distribution of US-spec R32 colours were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.vwvortex.com/showthread.php?1285689#post12525507|title=General Information|date=11 March 2004|access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deep Blue Pearl: 40%
* Reflex Silver: 35%
* Black Magic Pearl: 15%
* Tornado Red: 10%

Although the R32 looked similar to the 20th Anniversary GTI, it shared most major components with the 3.2-litre [[Audi TT]], including the engine, [[four-wheel drive]] system, and both front and rear suspension geometries. For the US, five thousand cars were produced and intended to be sold over a two-year period. The allotment sold out in 13 months.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The R32 is capable of 0-{{convert|100|km/h|1}} in 6.6&amp;nbsp;seconds, reduced to 6.4&amp;nbsp;seconds with the [[dual clutch gearbox]].&lt;ref name=VMS/&gt; Clearing the quarter mile in 14.1 seconds at {{convert|99.2|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, the R32 edges out its third fastest sibling, the top-of-the-line Phaeton 6.0-litre W12 (414&amp;nbsp;bhp), by a tenth of a second at the {{convert|1320|ft|m|0|adj=on}} mark.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

It has a high resale and used-car value; the [[Kelley Blue Book]] used car retail price (the price an individual might expect to pay for one from a dealer) for a model in excellent condition with low mileage exceeds the original retail price of the car in many cases, making it one of a few recent cars that have actually approached an increase in value. This premium can be explained mostly due to scarcity, both of the cars themselves due to low production and importation, and especially ones that still have low mileage.

==Mk4 ongoing production in China, and South America==
[[File:VW Bora HS.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese market VW Bora HS]]
In China, [[Volkswagen Group China|FAW-VW]] launched a new version of the Golf IV, with [[Volkswagen Group China|FAW-VW's]] facelifted Bora front, at the Beijing International Automobile Exhibition in 2006. It is named Bora HS to complement the Bora Mk IV range, as the Golf name has reserved for the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk6|Golf VI]], manufactured by [[Volkswagen Group China|FAW-VW]] in Q3, 2009. The Bora HS ended production in 2008.

The Golf Mk4 also continues to be sold in countries such as Brazil and Argentina. However, in Argentina the range is available with a 1.6&amp;nbsp;L [[Straight-four engine|four-cylinder]] petrol, a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L petrol inline four, a 1.8&amp;nbsp;L Turbocharged petrol unit, or with a 1.9-[[litre]] {{convert|130|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} turbodiesel. In [[Chile]], it was also sold until 2010, with a 1.6 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;L petrol range. All of these are Brazilian built models, although the diesels are only for export markets.

In [[Brazil]], the Mk4 Golf, marketed as the [[Volkswagen Gol|Gol]], has a 1.6l engine (with Volkswagen's Total Flex system which accepts both gasoline and ethanol), or a 2.0l engine (the 1.8 turbo engine was discontinued in 2009). It is available in two trim levels: the basic Sportline model with the 1.6 engine, and the 2.0 version with a [[Tiptronic]] 6-speed transmission.
[[File:Volkswagen City Golf.jpg|thumb|left|2008–2010 Volkswagen City Golf (Canada)]]

In 2007, Volkswagen Brazil introduced a major restyling of the fourth generation Golf. The front takes styling cues from the current [[Volkswagen Polo]] and the back of the car is inspired by the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Golf 5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motor-show.com.ar/2007/04/13/nuevo-vw-golf-en-brasil-generacion-iv-y-medio/ |title=Nuevo VW Golf en Brasil: Generación IV "y medio" |publisher=MotorShow |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is exported in most Latin America countries, since it is produced in Brazil. It was also sold in Canada, where it was sold alongside the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Mk5]] model (badged as the Rabbit). The lack of diesel models for the 2007 model year led Volkswagen Canada to continue sales of an entry-level car that was designed as an alternative to the TDI models for budget-minded shoppers.  The Canadian model was originally rebadged as the '''City Golf''', but in 2009 it was renamed the Golf City alongside the Jetta City.  It was not sold in the [[United States]].  Pricing of the Golf City started at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]15,300 as of 2008.  As an entry-level alternative to the Rabbit, it offered only one engine: the 2.0L [[SOHC]] 8 valve with {{Convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It was not related to the South African [[Volkswagen Citi]]Golf, despite the similarity in name. The Mk4 Jetta was similarly reintroduced in Canada for the 2007 model year as the City Jetta.  This was the first entry-level car from a previous-generation car since the 1992 [[Eagle Vista]], which was a rebadged 1980s [[Mitsubishi Mirage]]. Although the Golf City was dated, its attractive price enabled good sales. The Golf City was discontinued after the 2010 model year.

==Pope Benedict XVI==
In 1999, Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, prefect of the Catholic Church's Congregation of the ''Doctrine of the Faith'' under [[Pope John Paul II]], purchased a fourth-generation Golf in which to drive around Rome, selling it in 2005 after John Paul's death in anticipation of retiring and returning to Germany.

Instead, he became [[Pope Benedict XVI]]. Shortly after John Paul's death, his 1999 Golf sold to a German owner for $13,000,&lt;ref&gt;http://qi.com/television/series-j/joints/the-pope&lt;/ref&gt; who then sold the car for €188,938.88 via eBay to [[GoldenPalace.com]].&lt;ref name="dailymailpope"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jaymi Mccann |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2282965/From-peoples-car-Popemobile-Old-VW-Golf-set-sell-100-000-belonged-Pope-Benedict.html |title=From people's car to Popemobile: Old VW Golf set to sell for £100,000 because it once belonged to Pope Benedict &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2013-02-22 |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golf, undriven since the sale, was subsequently sold for £14,300 via eBay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Pope-Benedict-XVI-Volkswagen-Golf-/321076800159 |title=Pope Benedict XVI Volkswagen Golf |publisher=eBay |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal solid waste===
{{see also|Environmental issues in Thailand}}
Thais per capita generate an estimated 1.14 kg of solid waste per day—50 percent of it biodegradable.&lt;ref name="FP-20140901" /&gt; 
According to Interior Ministry statistics, refuse nationwide in 2016 amounted to 27 million tonnes, up about 0.7 percent from the previous year. Of this, 4.2 million tonnes was generated in Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suksamran|first1=Nauvarat|title=Suttipong told to clean up or else| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1376235/suttipong-told-to-clean-up-or-else|accessdate=11 December 2017|work=Bangkok Post|date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BP-20160613" /&gt; The yearly figure in 2009 was 15.1 million tonnes. About twenty percent of total is generated in the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Area]] (BMA)&lt;ref name=WMW&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gheewala|first1=Shabbir|title=Thai Style Recycling|url=https://waste-management-world.com/a/thai-style-recycling|website=Waste Management World (WMW)|accessdate=13 June 2016|date=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the waste generated in 2015, only about five million tonnes were recycled. Only about eight million tonnes were handled in accordance with global best practices. Of Thailand's 2,500 dump sites, only about 20 percent are managed properly.&lt;ref name="FP-20140901"&gt;{{cite news|title=How Thailand is hurtling towards a massive waste disposal crisis |url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/thailand-hurtling-towards-massive-waste-disposal-crisis-1690599.html|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=First Post|date=2014-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Pollution Control Department (PCD), Thailand's primary waste watchdog, the nation faces serious solid waste management issues. Those issues are increasing. Wichan Simachaya, director-general of the PCD, said the volume of waste could continue to grow by 600,000 tonnes a year, due to increasing population and tourism.&lt;ref name="BP-20160613"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mala|first1=Dumrongkiat|title=Media 'must help solve waste issue'|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1008541/media-must-help-solve-waste-issue|accessdate=13 June 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thailand's waste management plan calls for 75 percent of Thailand's total solid waste to be properly disposed of or recycled in some way by 2021, up from the current 49 percent. By 2021, the government and private sector plan to spend a total of 177 billion [[Thai baht|baht]] (US$5.1 billion) on waste management technology and public awareness campaigns. "We have fines for littering but no one seems to care," Wijarn said. "We need to step up law enforcement as well as teach people to recycle, reuse and reduce waste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yukako|first1=Ono|last2=Iwamoto|first2=Kentaro|title=Waste is in the spotlight as governments think green|url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Features/Urban-crisis-in-Asia/Waste-is-in-the-spotlight-as-governments-think-green|accessdate=6 October 2016|work=Nikkei Asian Review|date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Thailand]] the roles in [[Municipal solid waste|solid waste]] management (MSW) and industrial waste management are organized by the Royal Thai Government, which is then divided among the central government, regional governments, and local governments. Each government is responsible for different tasks. The central government is responsible to stimulate regulation, policies, and standards. The regional governments are responsible for coordinating central and local governments. Local governments are responsible for waste management in their governed area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jiaranaikhajorn|first1=Taweechai|title=Waste and Hazardous Substances Management Bureau|url=http://infofile.pcd.go.th/mgt/Overview_waste.pdf?CFID=818746&amp;CFTOKEN=13734972|publisher=Pollution Control Department (PCD)|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local governments themselves do not dispose of waste, but instead hire private companies that have been granted that right by the PCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pollution Control Department (PCD) Statement|url=http://www.pcd.go.th/about/en_ab_mission.html|publisher=Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major problem is lack of funding for waste management—the average Thai household pays less than one dollar a month to dispose of their solid waste.&lt;ref name="FP-20140901" /&gt; The main companies are Bangpoo Industrial Waste Management Center;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Visvanathan|first1=C.|title=Hazardous and Industrial Solid Waste Management in Thailand—an Overview| url=http://www.jgsee.kmutt.ac.th/jgsee1/NewsEvents/Seminar/ISSOWAMA/Visvanathan_Presentation.pdf|website=www.faculty.ait.ac.th/visu/|publisher=Asian Institute of Technology Thailand|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Environmental Conservation Public Company Limited (GENCO);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genco Background|url=http://www.genco.co.th/EN-About.htm|publisher=General Environment Conservation Public Company Ltd|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SGS Thailand;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SGS|url=http://www.sgs.co.th/en/Our-Company/About-SGS/SGS-in-Brief.aspx|publisher=SGS (Thailand) Ltd|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste Management Siam Ltd (WMS);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Waste Management Siam, Ltd.

====Plastic waste====
Thailand is a profligate user of one-time use plastics. Thais use 70 billion plastic bags a year.&lt;ref name="BP-20170723"&gt;{{cite news|title=Time to get tough with plastic users|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1292295/time-to-get-tough-with-plastic-users|accessdate=23 July 2017|work=Bangkok Post|date=2017-07-23|format=Editorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is a major contributor, along with  China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka,&lt;ref name="BP-20170905"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wipatayotin|first1=Apinya |title=Ministry plans road map for marine waste control|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1318643/ministry-plans-road-map-for-marine-waste-control|accessdate=5 September 2017|work=Bangkok Post|date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of up to 60 percent of [[plastic pollution]] in oceans.&lt;ref name="BP-20170723"/&gt; Thailand's 23 coastal provinces dump an estimated one million tonnes of garbage into the sea each year. Plastic bags make up 15 percent, plastic straws account for seven percent, and cigarette butts five percent. According to the [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Thailand)|Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment]], 150 sea turtles, 100 whales and dolphins, and 12 [[dugong]]s die each year from discarded trash, half of which die from eating plastic bags.&lt;ref name="BP-20170905" /&gt;

In June 2017, Thailand pledged at an international forum to reduce plastic use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand makes an effort to protect marine environment from marine debris and land-based pollution|url=https://oceanconference.un.org/commitments/?id=18208|website=The Ocean Conference|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand admitted waste mismanagement was the major cause of Thailand's poor record. Delegates representing Thailand's military government at the conference committed to put an end to the problem. Accordingly, it has included waste management in its 20-year national strategy.

In an easy step forward, Thailand's Pollution Control Department (PCD) got agreements from five major water bottlers to cease using plastic cap seals on drinking water bottles by 1 April 2018. A cap seal is the small plastic wrap molded over the bottle cap that must be peeled off before the bottle can be opened. Studies have found that bottles without them pose no hygienic health risk. The PCD aims to have them removed from all bottled water containers by the end of 2018. According to the PCD, Thailand produces 4.4 billion plastic drinking water bottles per year. Sixty percent, or 2.6 billion, of these bottles have cap seals. The weight of the plastic cap seals alone is around 520 tonnes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wipatayotin|first1=Apinya|title=PCD to axe water bottle seals by end of year|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/environment/1411958/pcd-to-axe-water-bottle-seals-by-end-of-year|accessdate=15 February 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2018 the Thai government kicked off a campaign to reduce the use of foam containers and single-use plastic bags at fresh markets countrywide. Early indications are that those efforts have not been embraced by the Thai public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wipataotin |first1=Apinya |title=Bid to cut plastic use irks shoppers, traders |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1507726/bid-to-cut-plastic-use-irks-shoppers-traders |accessdate=22 July 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Atthakor |first1=Ploenpote |title=Bag campaign 'not consistent with reality' |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1508318/bag-campaign-not-consistent-with-reality |accessdate=23 July 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial and toxic waste===
{{Asof|2016}} Thailand collected and processed the industrial waste of 68,261 companies. Its capacity to process industrial and toxic waste is 37.6 million tonnes annually, an estimated 2.8 million tonnes of which is toxic waste. Total capacity in 2015 was 25.8 million tonnes. The [[Ministry of Industry (Thailand)|Ministry of Industry]]'s Department of Industrial Works (DIW) plans to establish 15 regional waste management facilities throughout the country as detailed in its five-year waste management plan for 2015-2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apisitniran|first1=Lamonphet|title=Waste management capacity on the rise|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/1092773/waste-management-capacity-on-the-rise|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical waste====
The [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]]'s 500-bed General Hospital produces about 196,000 pieces of "medical waste" per month. About half of this waste consists of "clean products": packaging, PVC bags for dialysis solution, and other non-infectious items that could potentially be [[recycle]]d or [[upcycle]]d. Thailand has thirty-three 500-or more-bed hospitals, as well as 321 other hospitals and health centres with between 11 and 250 bed nationwide, meaning the quantity of medical waste is significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Srimalee |first1=Somluck |title=Making a hole in medical waste |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/lifestyle/30350502 |accessdate=21 July 2018 |work=The Nation |date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waste water==
In a 2004 study commissioned by the [[World Bank]] to examine the state of Thailand's infrastructure, the authors concluded that, "The worst infrastructure provision performance in Thailand is in waste water treatment....Virtually none of the...[waste water treatment] systems are operating....only 3 waste water plants operate sporadically. The problem is that no user fees are assessed or collected and that households and firm [sic] are not required to connect to the systems. Water supply authorities,...have consistently refused to add waste water charges to their water supply bills, despite clear evidence from international experience that this is best practice."&lt;ref name="WB-20041117"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Webster|first1=Douglas|last2=Theeratham|first2=Patharaporn|title=Policy Coordination, Planning and Infrastructure Provision: A Case Study of Thailand|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEAPINFRASTRUCT/Resources/855084-1137106254308/Thailand.pdf|website=World Bank|accessdate=23 September 2016|format=PDF|date=2004-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2016, the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] (BMA) is considering the imposition of a waste water fee, pending endorsement by the BMA council. If approved, the move will impose fees on waste water release:

* Households producing waste water of 10-100 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per month will be charged 30 baht
* State agencies, schools, companies, hospitals producting less than 500 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; will be charged 500 baht
* Discharging between 500-1,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; will incur a 1,000 baht charge
* Discharge exceeding 1,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; will be charged 1,500 baht
* Factories, hotels, and other large-scale users will pay four baht per cubic metre

The fees collected will be used to improve waste water facilities operated by the BMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wancharoen|first1=Supoj|title=BMA mulls billing for waste water|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1135413/bma-mulls-billing-for-waste-water|accessdate=15 November 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Thailand produced 9.5 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of waste water.&lt;ref name="PCDR-2015"&gt;{{cite book|title=Thailand State of Pollution Report 2015|publisher=Pollution Control Department|location=Bangkok|isbn=978-616-316-327-1|url=http://infofile.pcd.go.th/mgt/PollutionReport2015_en.pdf?CFID=2140989&amp;CFTOKEN=61488210|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|47}} This was the equivalent of 150 litres per day per person.&lt;ref name="PCDR-2015" /&gt;{{RP|50}} Only 34 percent of the waste water was treated at one of Thailand's 93 treatment facilities before being returned to the environment.&lt;ref name="PCDR-2015" /&gt;{{RP|47}} One direct result was a corresponding deterioration of the quality of Thai coastal waters.&lt;ref name="PCDR-2015" /&gt;{{RP|62}}

==Environmental impacts==
According to the [[United Nations Ocean Conference]] Thailand produces about 50.000 tonnes of solid waste that finds its way into the sea each year.&lt;ref&gt;https://oceanconference.un.org/commitments/?id=18208&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of coastal rubbish, especially in the upper reaches of the [[Gulf of Thailand]] impact sea life and coastal mangroves. Mangrove swamps are cluttered with garbage. At one site, the ''Bangkok Post'' reported that, "Plastic bags, bottles, ropes, discarded noodle containers and even a rusty cooking appliance float in the water or are stuck in the mud under the green canopy."&lt;ref name="BP-20160925"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wangkiat|first1=Paritta|title=Breach of trust|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/special-reports/1094405/breach-of-trust|accessdate=25 September 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thai Pollution Control Department (PCD) reports that the water quality of major rivers flowing into the upper Gulf of Thailand has seriously deteriorated in the past decade. The department found the lower [[Chao Phraya River]], which flows through Bangkok, contains bacteria and nutrient pollution from [[phosphate]]s, [[phosphorus]], and [[nitrogen]]. Nutrient pollution causes algae to grow faster than ecosystems can handle, harming water quality, food resources for aquatic animals, and marine habitats. It also decreases the oxygen that fish need to survive. PCD categorised water quality at the mouth of Chao Phraya at Bangkok's [[Bang Khun Thian District]] as "very poor" and worse than in 2014. Nearby rivers, such as the [[Tha Chin River|Tha Chin]] in [[Samut Sakhon]], were rated "poor".&lt;ref name="PCDR-2015" /&gt;{{RP|56}} PCD findings indicated large amounts of wastewater were discharged into the river from households, industry, and agriculture.&lt;ref name="BP-20160925" /&gt;

[[Image:Zblangrowth.jpg|thumb|ZBLAN produced with the same test-setup in zero-gravity (left; aboard a [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]] plane) and in normal gravity (right)]]

Heavy metal [[fluoride glass]]es were accidentally discovered in 1975 by Poulain and Lucas at the University of Rennes in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1016/0025-5408(75)90106-3|title =Verres fluores au tetrafluorure de zirconium proprietes optiques d'un verre dope au Nd3+|year =1975|author =Poulain, M|journal =Materials Research Bulletin|volume =10|pages =243|last2 =Poulain|first2 =M|last3 =Lucas|first3 =J|issue =4}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a family of glasses '''ZBLAN''' with a composition '''Z'''rF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-'''B'''aF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-'''L'''aF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-'''A'''lF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-'''N'''aF.

== Description ==

ZBLAN has a broad optical transmission window extending from 0.3 micrometers in the UV to 7 micrometers in the infrared, low refractive index (1.50), a relatively low glass transition temperature (''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) of 260 °C, low [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] and a low and negative ''dn''/''dT'' (temperature dependence of refractive index).&lt;ref name="rutg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irfibers.rutgers.edu/pdf_files/ir_fiber_review.pdf |format=PDF |title=Infrared Fiber Optics |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |last=Harrington |first=James A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
ZBLAN glass is the most stable fluoride glass known and is most commonly used to make optical fiber. Recent{{when|date=August 2016}} advances by ZBLAN fiber manufacturers have demonstrated significant increases in mechanical properties (&gt;100 kpsi or 700 MPa for 125&amp;nbsp;µm fiber) and attenuation as low as 3 dB/km at 2.6&amp;nbsp;µm. ZBLAN optical fibers are used in different applications such as spectroscopy and sensing, laser power delivery and fiber lasers and amplifiers.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

== Comparison with alternative fiber technologies ==

The advantages of ZBLAN over other glasses available in 1988, such as [[silica]], is superior infrared transmittance. Their drawbacks are fragility and sensitivity to acids. ZBLAN glass resistance to water depends strongly on the acidity of the aqueous solution. Acidic solutions will attack it, whereas basic solutions will have no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Corrosion of uranium IV fluoride glasses in aqueous solutions| author =Guery, J., Chen, D. G., Simmons, C. J., Simmons, J. H., and Jcoboni, C. | year =1988| journal = Phys. Chem. Glasses |volume = 29 | pages =30–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atmospheric moisture has a very limited effect on fluoride glasses in general, and fluoride glass/fibers can be used in a wide range of operating environments over extended periods of time without any material degradation.&lt;ref&gt;K. Fujiura, K. Hoshino, T. Kanamori, Y. Nishida, Y. Ohishi, S. Sudo, Technical Digest of Optical Amplifiers and Their Applications, Davos, Switzerland. 15–17 June 1995 (Optical Society of America, Washington DC, USA, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

A large variety of multicomponent fluoride glasses have been fabricated but few can be drawn into optical fiber. The fiber fabrication is similar to any glass-fiber drawing technology. All methods involve fabrication from the melt, which creates
inherent problems such as the formation of bubbles, core-clad interface irregularities, and small preform sizes. The process occurs at 310 °C in a controlled atmosphere (to minimize contamination by moisture or oxygen impurities which significantly
weaken the fiber) using a narrow heat zone compared to silica.&lt;ref name="rutg"/&gt; Drawing is complicated by a small difference (only 124 °C) between the glass transition temperature and the crystallization temperature. As a result, ZBLAN fibers often contain undesired crystallites. The concentration of crystallites was shown in 1998 to be reduced by growing ZBLAN in [[zero gravity]] (see figure) which reduces convection processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/msad05feb98_1.htm| title = ZBLAN continues to show promise| date = February 5, 1998| accessdate = 2009-06-06| publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, a Silicon Valley aerospace company, [[Made In Space, Inc.|Made In Space]], announced that they plan to begin manufacturing ZBLAN in [[outer space|space]] for commercial purposes starting in 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
