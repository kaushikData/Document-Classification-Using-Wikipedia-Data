'''Alluvium''' (from the [[Latin]] ''alluvius'', from ''alluere'', "to wash against") is loose, unconsolidated (not cemented together into a solid [[Rock (geology)|rock]]) [[soil]] or [[sediment]] that has been [[Erosion|eroded]], reshaped by water in some form, and redeposited in a non-[[marine (ocean)|marine]] setting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110501155938/http://www.geotech.org/survey/geotech/dictiona.html Glossary of Geological Terms]. Geotech.org. Retrieved on 2012-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/dictionary/glossary-a.shtml Geology Dictionary – Alluvial, Aquiclude, Arkose]. Geology.Com. Retrieved on 2012-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Alluvium is typically made up of a variety of materials, including fine particles of [[silt]] and [[clay]] and larger particles of [[sand]] and [[gravel]].  When this loose alluvial material is deposited or cemented into a [[Lithology|lithological]] unit, or [[Lithification|lithified]], it is called an '''alluvial deposit'''.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Chisholm, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The term "alluvium" is not typically used in situations where the formation of the sediment can clearly be attributed to another geologic process that is well described.  This includes (but is not limited to): lake sediments ([[Lake|lacustrine]]), river sediments ([[fluvial]]), or glacially-derived sediments ([[glacial till]]).  Sediments that are formed or deposited in a perennial stream or [[river]] are typically not referred to as alluvial.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==Age==
Most alluvium is geologically [[Quaternary]] in age, and is often referred to as "cover" because these sediments obscure the underlying [[bedrock]].  Most sedimentary material that fills a [[Sedimentary basin|basin]] ("basin fill") that is not lithified is typically lumped together as "alluvial".&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Alluvium of [[Pliocene]] age occurs, for example, in parts of Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ames | first = Dan | contribution = Formation of the Soils | year = 1998 | title = Soil Survey of Jerome County and Part of Twin Falls County, Idaho | pages = 238 | publisher = Natural Resources Conservation Service, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] | contribution-url = https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MANUSCRIPTS/idaho/ID704/0/id704_text.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alluvium of late [[Miocene]] age occurs, for example, in the valley of the [[San Joaquin River]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1197/report.pdf | title=Amount and Timing of Late Cenozoic Uplift and Tilt of the Central Sierra Nevada, California—Evidence from the Upper San Joaquin River Basin (USGS Professional Paper 1197) | publisher=[[USGS]] | author=Huber, N. King | year=1981 | location=Washington D.C. | pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ores==
Alluvium can contain valuable [[ore]]s such as [[gold]] and [[platinum]] and a wide variety of [[gemstone]]s. Such a concentration of valuable ores is termed a [[placer deposit]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

'''Ballybofey''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|æ|l|iː|b|ə|ˈ|f|eɪ}}; {{Irish place name|Bealach Féich|Fiach's pass}}) is a town located on the south bank of the [[River Finn (County Donegal)|River Finn]], [[County Donegal]], Ireland. Together with the smaller town of [[Stranorlar]] on the north side of the [[River Finn (County Donegal)|River Finn]], the towns form the Twin Towns of [[Ballybofey and Stranorlar|Ballybofey-Stranorlar]]. Ballybofey-Stranorlar, a [[Census_town#Ireland|census town]], had a population of 4,852 in the 2016.&lt;ref name="sapmap2016"/&gt;

The town grew rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries. Ballybofey also plays host to the Twin Towns Festival which takes place annually. The centrepiece of the festival is a [[parade]] on the Sunday. The last of these took place on 19 August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donegaldirect.com/ws_events.aspx?Section=Festivals+%26+Events&amp;Region=Stranorlar |title=Donegal Direct |publisher=Donegal Direct |date= |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are no schools or churches in the town of Ballybofey itself, with all these amenities lying either across the bridge in [[Stranorlar]] or outside the town limits. This is due to laws during plantation times when certain Catholic buildings were not allowed within a specified range of Protestant towns, in this case [[Stranorlar]], though Stranorlar now has both a Roman Catholic and a Church of Ireland church.

==History==
A few miles west of Ballybofey, on the main road to [[Fintown]] (the [[Regional roads in Ireland|R]]252), is the Glenmore Estate, located at Welchtown. The [[country estate|estate]] formerly included Glenmore Lodge, a [[English country houses|country house]] that stood on the opposite, southern bank of the [[River Finn (County Donegal)|River Finn]], near Glenmore Bridge. The house was originally built in the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian-style]] in the mid-to-late-18th-century. It was re-worked for Sir William Styles in the [[neo-Tudor]]-style in the early 20th-century. The house was demolished in the 1990s. The private estate is now known for its fishing and hunting.&lt;ref name="P. 308"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowan|first=Prof. Alistair|title=Buildings of Ireland: North West Ulster.|year=1979|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=0-300-09667-4|page=564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bratislavský lesný park''' or '''Bratislava Forest Park''' is a [[forest]] [[park]] (actually a forest) in [[Bratislava]], the capital of [[Slovakia]], located in the foothills of the [[Little Carpathians]]. Officially, it is part of numerous boroughs of Bratislava: [[Dúbravka, Bratislava|Dúbravka]], [[Karlova Ves]], [[Záhorská Bystrica]], Vinohrady, [[Old Town, Bratislava|Old Town]], [[Nové Mesto, Bratislava|New Town]] and [[Rača, Bratislava|Rača]]. The park is administered by Mestské lesy v Bratislave (Bratislava City Forests), a specialized non-profit organization ({{lang-sk|samostatne hospodáriaca príspevková organizácia hlavného mesta SR Bratislavy}}). It covers an area of 27.3&amp;nbsp;km² (10.54&amp;nbsp;mi²), of which 96% is covered with forests; the rest consists of meadows, water and built-up areas. The [[Vydrica (river)|Vydrica]] river originates in the park's territory.

With its dense network of hiking trails, roads and recreational facilities, Bratislava Forest Park includes many localities popular among visitors, such as ''Železná studienka'' (Little iron well), ''Partizánska lúka'' (Partisan meadow), [[Koliba]] and the [[Kamzík TV Tower]]. Two-thirds of visitors enter the Bratislava Forest Park through the [[Červený most]] area near [[Patrónka]], a major transport junction in the city.&lt;ref name=BALESY1&gt;{{cite web|title=Prieskum návštevnosti lesoparku - výsledky|url=http://www.ba-lesy.sk/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=451035&amp;id=2291|publisher=Mestské Lesy v Bratislave|accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is served by the [[Železná studienka Bratislava train station]], the [[Public transport in Bratislava|public city transport]] and parking is provided for up to 150 vehicles.

== History ==
The area of the Bratislava Forest Park has been inhabited since the [[paleolithic]] age by hunter-gatherers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ba-lesy.sk/VismoOnline_ActionScripts/File.aspx?id_org=451035&amp;id_dokumenty=1045&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neolithic]] age brought the transition to farming marking the beginning of human transformation of the local environment. [[Iron Age]] brought the usage of [[iron]] and numerous [[tribe]] movements, often conducting warfare in the areas they were moving into. Notable ethnic groups from this time include the [[Celts]] and the [[Quadi]], the latter had to divide their power with the [[Roman Empire]], whose northern border was the [[Danube]] river, just south of the area of today's Bratislava Forest Park. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] exploited the natural resources across their border, hunting larger animals and cutting down the [[primeval forest]], transporting the wood on the Danube downstream to their military camps and provinces. The Romans also introduced [[viticulture]] into the region that would be famous for its [[wine]]s later, in the [[Middle Ages]].

== Description ==

=== Flora ===
The park flora belongs to the [[Western Carpathians]] flora (Carpaticum occidentale) and into its part Praecarpaticum slovacum. The area is densely forested, original trees are [[oak]] and [[beech]]. Other plants include [[Acer campestre|field maple]], and [[elderberry]].

=== Fauna ===
Animals within the park boundaries belong to the [[Palearctic ecozone]]. Notable [[arthropod]]s include [[Lucanus cervus]], [[Carabus variolosus]], rarely also [[Rosalia alpina]], [[Cerambyx cerdo]] and [[Osmoderma eremita]]. [[Dragonflies]] (Odonata) are abundant, notable species include [[Cordulegaster heros]], one of the biggest dragonflies in Slovakia. Its [[larvae]] live in the river [[Vydrica (river)|Vydrica]] sediments. Notable [[crustaceans]] (Crustacea) include the rare [[Austropotamobius torrentium]], also living in the Vydrica.

There is insufficient data on [[fish]] species but they appear to be rather insignificant, bigger species have been artificially introduced for human fishing. [[Amphibians]] and [[reptiles]] include [[Salamandra salamandra]], [[Rana temporaria]], [[Bufo bufo]] and [[Rana esculenta]], rarely also other species such as [[Hyla arborea]], [[Rana dalmatina]], etc. Reptiles include the numerous [[Anguis fragilis]] and the much rarer [[Lacerta agilis]], [[Lacerta viridis]], [[Elaphe longissima]], and extremely rarely also [[Coronella austriaca]] and [[Natrix natrix]].

There have been over 50 bird species recognized within the park, including [[Falco cherrug]], [[Pernis apivorus]] and [[Strix aluco]]. There are 14 identified bat species, the order [[insectivora]] includes [[Sorex araneus]], [[Talpa europaea]] and [[Erinaceus europaeus]]. Rodents include [[Clethrionomys glareolus]], [[Apodemus sylvaticus]], [[Sciurus vulgaris]] and [[Glis glis]]. Larger animals include the numerous [[Capreolus capreolus]], [[Sus scrofa]], [[Vulpes vulpes]], [[Martes martes]], [[Martes foina]], [[Mustela nivalis]] and the rare [[Ovis aries]], [[Dama dama]], [[Cervus elaphus]], [[Meles meles]], [[Lepus europaeus]] and [[Lutra lutra]] (probably only a few individuals). There are no wolves or bears in the park.

=== Hunting ===
The whole area of the Bratislava Forest Park is an official, active hunting ground. There are seven crops fields for wild animals, three [[Red deer]] feeders, 25 [[Roe deer]] feeders and 16 hunter's watch towers. There is no hunter's lodge in the park.

Hunting is managed by the Bratislava City Forests ({{lang-sk|Mestské lesy v Bratislave}}) using their own hunters and eight [[hunting dog]]s. The company also sells hunting tickets. Fishing is managed by the Bratislava subsidiary of the Slovak fisher's union in Žilina ({{lang-sk|Slovenský rybársky zväz v Žiline, mestská organizácia v Bratislave}}).

== Tourism ==
[[Image:BA lesný park tabuľa 1.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Bratislava Forest Park.]]

Bratislava Forest Park is accessible by public transport. ''Železná studienka'' itself can be reached in five minutes by bus No. 43, starting from [[Patrónka]] (a major transport junction in [[Bratislava]]). Automobile access to the park is limited.

The last research of the visitors to the Bratislava Forest Park was conducted during June and July 2012 as part of the Urbannatur project, which is part of the Cross-border Cooperation Program Slovakia - Austria 2007-2013, financed by the [[European Union]] and the state budget of the Slovak Republic. The research concluded that the most important entrance point into the park is [[Červený most]] with 62% total visitors, other entrance points in descending order of use are [[Koliba]] and [[Pekná cesta – Horáreň Krasňany]]. Cyclists represent 13% of all visitors, most of them - 37% access the park from Potočná Street in [[Rača, Bratislava|Rača]].

While dogs are allowed entry into the park, visitors are prohibited from letting them off the leash.&lt;ref name=BALESYdog&gt;{{cite web|title=Voľný pohyb psa (Free dog movement)|url=http://www.ba-lesy.sk/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=451035&amp;id=2080&amp;query=zakaz|publisher=Mestské Lesy v Bratislave|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to VZN 6/2003 §2, letter C, the Bratislava Forest Park is a public area ({{lang-sk|verejné priestranstvo}}).

'''Brittany''' ({{lang-br|Breizh}}, {{lang-fr|Bretagne}}, {{IPA-fr|bʁətaɲ|IPA|fr-Bretagne.ogg}}) is one of the 18 [[regions of France|regions]] of [[France]]. It is named after the historic and geographic region of [[Brittany]], of which it constitutes 80%. The capital is [[Rennes]].
Bathed by the English Channel to the north and the Bay of Biscay to the south, it is located in the West of France, bordering the [[Normandy]] and [[Pays de la Loire]] regions. [[Bro Gozh ma Zadoù]] is the anthem of Brittany. It is sung to the same tune as that of the national anthem of [[Wales]], [[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]], and has similar words. As a region of France, Brittany has a [[Regional Council of Brittany|Regional Council]], which was most recently elected in [[French regional elections, 2015|2015]].

== Territory ==
[[File:LeDiben Harbor.jpg|thumb|left|Le Diben harbour – [[Plougasnou]] (Brittany)]]
The region of Brittany was created in 1941 on 80% of the territory of [[Brittany (historical province)|traditional Brittany]]. The remaining 20% is now called the [[departments of France|department]] of [[Loire-Atlantique]], which is included in the region of [[Pays de la Loire]], whose capital, [[Nantes]], was the historical capital of the [[Duchy of Brittany]].

Part of the reason Brittany was split between two present-day regions was to avoid the rivalry between Rennes and Nantes. Although Nantes was the principal capital of the Duchy of Brittany until the sixteenth century, Rennes had been the seat of the Duchy's supreme court of justice between 1560 and 1789. Rennes had also been the administrative capital of the [[Intendant]] of Brittany between 1689 and 1789, and Intendances were the most important administrative units of the [[kingdom of France]] in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. As for the provincial States of Brittany, a legislative body which had originally met every two years in a different city of Brittany, that had met in Rennes only between 1728 and 1789, although not in the years 1730, 1758, and 1760. Despite that, the ''[[Chambre des comptes]]'' had remained in Nantes until 1789. However, from 1381 until the end of the fifteenth century [[Vannes]] (''Gwened'' in Breton) had served as the administrative capital of the Duchy, remaining the seat of its ''Chambre des comptes'' until the 1490s, and also the seat of the its ''Parlement'' until 1553 and then again between 1675 and 1689.

Although there were previous plans to create regions out of the departments, like the Clémentel plan (1919) or the Vichy regionalisation programme (1941), these plans had no effect or else were abolished in 1945. The current [[Regions of France|French regions]] date from 1956 and were created by gathering departments together.&lt;ref&gt;Michèle Cointet, op. cit., pp. 183-216 (p. 216 pour la citation)&lt;/ref&gt; In Brittany, this led to the creation of the new region of Brittany, which included only four out of the five historical Breton departments. The term ''région'' was officially created by the Law of Decentralisation (2 March 1982), which also gave regions their legal status. The first direct elections for regional representatives took place on 16 March 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marie Miossec (2009), ''Géohistoire de la régionalisation en France,'' Paris: Presses universitaires de France {{ISBN|978-2-13-056665-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the population in administrative Brittany and in Nantes continue to protest against the division of the traditional territory of Brittany, hoping to see the department of Loire-Atlantique reunited with the administrative region of Brittany. However, such a reunification raises other questions: first, what to do with the remainder of the present region of Pays de la Loire, and second, which city should be chosen as the capital of such a reunified Brittany.

== History ==
* ''See [[History of Brittany]]''
Brittany, lying in the northwest corner of France, is one of the great historic provinces of France. The most Atlantic of France's regions, Brittany is proud of its Celtic heritage, that sets it apart from the rest of France. It enjoys a mild climate somewhat warmer though not necessarily drier than the climate of the southwest of England.
The name "Brittany" derives from the Britons who, back in the Dark Ages, came south across the English Channel to seek refuge from the Anglo Saxon invaders who were pushing them out of a large part of the island of Great Britain.

In this historic past, other Britons fled to the west and south west of their own island, to Wales and Cornwall; and so it is that today, Brittany shares a historic culture with the other Celtic regions of northwest Europe. Today, the French administrative region of Brittany covers four "departments", the Côtes d'Armor (22) in the north, Finistère (29) in the far west, Morbihan (56) in the south, and Ille et Vilaine (35) in the east, bordering on Normandy and the Loire valley area. Another department used to belong to the historic province of Brittany, and this was the Loire Atlantique (44), the area round the city of Nantes which used once to be the Breton capital, but is today no longer in the region. The capital city of the modern Brittany region is Rennes, located in the central eastern part of the region; most of the major lines of communication between Brittany and Paris pass through Rennes, which is a large industrial and university city. Other important cities in the region are Brest, one of the two most important French naval ports, St Malo, an imposing walled city on the north coast, and Vannes, the capital of the Morbihan, with an attractive old town centre. Quimper, the capital of the Finistère, and St. Brieuc, the capital of the Côtes d'Armor, are less important. Lorient, in the Morbihan, was once a major shipping port trading with – as its name suggests – the Orient; but its shipping and shipbuilding industries have largely declined, and like other ports on the south coast of Brittany, is better known today for its yachting and yacht-building industry. It is also the venue for Brittany's annual Interceltiques music and culture festival.

Despite its limited size, Brittany is quite a diverse region; the north and west coasts, open to the force of the North Atlantic, are rugged and rocky, with beautiful sandy coves and beaches. The south coast, facing onto the Bay of Biscay, is flatter, much milder, and graced by a number of large sandy beaches. There are also a lot of inlets on the south coast, such as La Trinité sur Mer, which in the past have been ports and commercial harbours, but today are more popular with yachtsmen and a dwindling fishing industry. The sea here is warmer in summer. The backbone of Brittany is a granite ridge stretching from east to west, peaking in the Monts d'Arrée. But most of inland Brittany is gentle farming country, a region famous for its milk and butter and its early crops.
As a holiday region, it is of course Brittany's coasts that attract the greatest number of visitors; the inland regions are on the whole quite tranquil and for this reason have attracted a lot of second-home owners from other parts of France, and from Britain.
In cultural terms, Brittany is very distinctive, with its own language and Celtic cultural tradition that set it apart from the rest of France. The Breton language, though not much used in everyday life, and not understood by most of the modern population, has made a comeback in recent years, and is taught in a lot of schools. Celtic traditions are alive or recalled today in Breton folk music, its Celtic festivals, and its many prehistoric monuments.

The name of Brittany derives from settlers from [[Great Britain]], who fled that island in the wake of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] conquest of England between the fifth and seventh centuries. Unlike the rest of France and Brittany, [[Lower Brittany]] (roughly, west of a boundary from [[Saint-Brieuc|Saint Brieuc]] to [[Vannes]]) has maintained a distinctly [[Celtic language]], [[Breton language|Breton]], which is related to [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. It was the dominant language in Lower, or western, Brittany until the mid-20th century. It has been granted [[regional language]] status and revival efforts are underway. In [[Upper Brittany|Upper, or eastern, Brittany]], the traditional language is [[Gallo language|Gallo]], an [[Oïl language]], which has also received regional recognition and is in the process of being revived.

[[File:Logo_in_breton_language_used_by_Regional_Council_of_Brittany_and_its_administrative_territory.png|thumb|Breton is used on Regional Council of Brittany logo]]The French administration now allows for some Breton or Gallo to be used by the region and its communes, in road signs and names of towns and cities, alongside the official [[French language|French]] version. The two regional languages are also taught in some schools, and many folklore associations and clubs are trying to revive them.

Brittany has historically been a stronghold of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and its rates of [[church attendance]] have tended to be considerably higher than the national average. However, in recent years the influence of the church has declined.

The Region of Brittany is administered by the [[Regional Council of Brittany]].

The region was a traditionally conservative and [[Christian democratic]] region, with the notable exception of the department of [[Côtes-d'Armor]], a longtime stronghold of the political left. However, the whole of Brittany has recently been moving towards the left, in 2004 electing [[Jean-Yves Le Drian]] as its first [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] regional president, and in the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]] voting for Socialist [[Ségolène Royal]]. The centrist candidate [[François Bayrou]] also polled relatively highly in the region and [[Fougères]] elected a [[Democratic Movement (France)|MoDem]] deputy to the National Assembly (he has since joined the pro-[[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] [[New Centre]]). The [[French Communist Party]]'s support is largely concentrated in the south-west of the [[Côtes-d'Armor]] and north-west of [[Morbihan]]. The [[The Greens (France)|Greens]] and other environmentalist parties have traditionally been strong in the region, especially in urban areas such as [[Rennes]] or [[Arrondissement of Quimper|Quimper]]. The region was one of the few which voted "Yes" to the European constitution in the [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|2005 referendum]], and Brittany continues, along with [[Alsace]], to be a strongly pro-European region.

The Socialist Party controls three [[General councils (France)|general councils]] ([[Ille-et-Vilaine]], [[Côtes-d'Armor]], and [[Finistère]]), while the centrist [[Democratic Movement (France)|MoDem]] controls that of [[Morbihan]], in a coalition with the right.

[[TER Bretagne]] is the regional rail network serving Brittany in order to link the cities of Brittany to each other. [[OUIBUS]] coach services link the region with the largest cities in [[France]] at low cost. In addition there is [[Brittany Ferries]] that take passengers, vehicles and freight to the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Spain]] and [[Condor Ferries]] to the [[Channel Islands]].

=== Climate ===
Unlike more easterly areas with greater continental influence, Brittany has a strictly [[oceanic climate]] due to direct contact with the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[English Channel]]. The winds come from the northwest direction which softens the extreme variations of temperature. As it moves further south the weather becomes drier and drier. It is also known for the sudden change of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.groupe-mercure.fr/regions/le-climat-en-bretagne.html|title=Le climat en Bretagne {{!}} Régions|website=www.groupe-mercure.fr|language=fr-fr|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme northwest has 10 or less days with temperatures above 25 ° C, which makes heat waves rare, although they can happen of 50 days to the southeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.observatoire-eau-bretagne.fr/Media/Documentation/Bibliographies/Le-climat-en-Bretagne.-Une-douceur-oceanique-tout-en-nuance/(categorie)/29755|title=Le climat en Bretagne.

A '''Camptown''', in the country of [[Lesotho]], refers to a district capital for one of the ten [[districts of Lesotho]]. The largest camptown is the city of [[Maseru]] in [[Maseru District]]. Camptowns are usually commerce hubs for the district and are the location for the central government offices for the district. Camptowns usually take the same name as the district in which they are located. For example, as mentioned the camptown for Maseru is Maseru but also the camptown for [[Thaba-Tseka District]] is [[Thaba-Tseka]]. The exceptions to this rule are [[Berea District]] whose capital is called [[Teyateyaneng]], [[Quthing District]] whose capital is called [[Moyeni, Quthing|Moyeni]] and [[Leribe District]] whose capital is most often called [[Hlotse]].

It presumably derives from the 19th century police camps, then (now archaic) in Sesotho ''likampo''. Official colonial government terminology was ''government reserve'', which prosaically became ''urban area'' post-independence.

=== Migration ===
The movement of people within the Union i.e. internal migration, remains limited; it has traditionally followed two patterns:

*Younger workers from less economically developed regions and countries of the EU tend to move to more prosperous regions in their country or to EU countries with good economic prospects (i.e. UK, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Poland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/3869241-new-promised-land |title=Poland: A new promised land &amp;#124; VoxEurop.eu: European news, cartoons and press reviews |website=Presseurop.eu |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Retirees from wealthier places with colder weather (i.e. [[Benelux]], Britain and Germany) tend to move to the sun belt in southern Europe - i.e. Spain, Portugal, [[Southern France]], [[Italian peninsula]] and Greece.

Citizens from the European Union make up a growing proportion of immigrants in Spain. They mainly come from countries like the UK and Germany, but the British migration case is of particular interest due to its magnitude. The British authorities estimate that the real population of British citizens living in Spain is much higher than Spanish official figures suggest, establishing them at about 1,000,000 and about 800,000 being permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/brits_abroad/html/europe.stm |title=Special Reports &amp;#124; Brits Abroad |publisher=BBC News |date= 6 December 2006|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6161705.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Brits Abroad: Country-by-country |publisher=BBC News |date=11 December 2006 |accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=[[Giles Tremlett]] in Madrid |url=https://www.theguardian.com/spain/article/0,,1830838,00.html |title=Spain attracts record levels of immigrants seeking jobs and sun &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 26 July 2006|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.byebyeblighty.com/1/british-immigrants-swamping-spanish-villages/ |title=British Immigrants Swamping Spanish Villages? |publisher=Byebyeblighty.com |date=16 January 2007 |accessdate=25 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421015634/http://www.byebyeblighty.com/1/british-immigrants-swamping-spanish-villages/ |archivedate=21 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Jason Burke |url=https://www.theguardian.com/spain/article/0,,1588156,00.html |title=An Englishman's home is his casa as thousands go south &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; The Observer |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 9 October 2005|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Casciani |first=Dominic |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6210358.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; 5.5m Britons 'opt to live abroad' |publisher=BBC News |date=11 December 2006 |accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5237236.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; More Britons consider move abroad |publisher=BBC News |date=2 August 2006 |accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration and emigration===
{{Further|Immigration to Europe|Emigration from Europe}}
At present, more people immigrate into the European Union than [[Emigration|emigrate]] from it.  Immigration is a [[controversial]] issue in many member states, including Belgium, Sweden, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, France, and the UK.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 2010, 47.3 million people living in the EU, or 9.4% of the total population, had been born outside their resident country.  Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) had been born outside the EU; 16.0 million (3.2%) had been born in another member state.  The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million), Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF 6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% were born abroad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128101046/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF |date=28 January 2012 }}, Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain in particular receives most of the immigrants coming illegally to Europe from Africa, probably due to its large coastal area and its proximity to and land borders with Morocco at Ceuta and Melilla; African immigrants try to enter the country by boat from Morocco or Senegal or by jumping the border fences.  For example, during just the first weekend of September 2006, more than 1,300 illegal immigrants arrived on beaches in the Canary Islands&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5310412.stm Canaries migrant surge tops 1,300] BBC News, 4 September 2006. Retrieved 4 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and estimates are that between 50,000 and 70,000 people enter the European Union illegally through Spanish borders or beaches. [[Separation barrier|Border fences]] have been built at both the [[Ceuta border fence|Ceuta]] and [[Melilla border fence|Melilla]] borders in an attempt to stop illegal entrance to the country. Illegal immigration is an issue in [[Spanish politics]], and also a big human rights problem, since many people die during the journey. Spain has been Europe's largest absorber of migrants for the past six years, with its immigrant population increasing fourfold as 2.8&amp;nbsp;million people have arrived, mostly from Latin America. Spectacular growth in Spain's immigrant population came as the country's economy created more than half of all the new jobs in the European Union between 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/spain/article/0,,1830838,00.html Spain attracts record levels of immigrants seeking jobs and sun], ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved 26 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The net migration rate for the EU in 2008 was 3.1 per 1,000 inhabitants;&lt;ref name="epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-03082009-AP/EN/3-03082009-AP-EN.PDF| title = 5.4&amp;nbsp;million children born in EU27 in 2008|publisher=Eurostat }}&lt;/ref&gt; this figure is for migration into and out of the European Union, and therefore excludes any internal movements between member states.  Annual net migration has varied from 1.5 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;million people since 2003.&lt;ref name="epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu" /&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in the European Union}}

The EU has significant religious diversity, mirroring its diverse history and culture. The largest religious group professes 
[[Christianity]] and accounts for 72% of the [[European Union|EU]] population,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discrimination in the EU in 2012 |work=[[Eurobarometer|Special Eurobarometer]] |year=2012 |series=383 |page=233 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2013 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |location=[[European Union]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202023700/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; predominantly Roman Catholicism, Protestantism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Several EU nations do not have a Christian majority and for example in [[Estonia]] and the [[Czech Republic]] the majority have no religious affiliation.

Today, theism is losing prevalence in Europe in favour of atheism and agnosticism, and religion is losing prevalence in favour of secularism. European countries have experienced a decline in church attendance as well as a decline in the number of people professing a religious belief. The 2005 Eurobarometer Poll found that, on average, 52% of the citizens of EU Member States state that they believe there is a God, 27% believe there is some sort of spirit or life force and 18% don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force. 3% declined to answer.

A decrease in church membership and church attendance in Europe (especially in [[Belgium]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Sweden]]) has been noted and church attendance (percentage wise of the total population by country) in northern and western Europe is typically in the single digits.

European indigenous (or native) religions are still alive in small and diverse minorities, especially in [[Scandinavia]], [[Baltic states]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]].

The recent influx of immigrants to the affluent EU nations has brought in various religions of their native homelands, including [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. [[Judaism]] has had a long history in Europe and has coexisted with the other religions for centuries, despite periods of persecution or genocide by European rulers. [[Islam in Europe|Islam]] too has had a long history in Europe, with Spain and Portugal at one time having a Muslim majority.&lt;ref name="Hourani"&gt;[[Albert Hourani|Hourani, Albert]], ''[[History of the Arab Peoples]]'', Faber &amp; Faber, 2002, {{ISBN|0-571-21591-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large Muslim populations also exist in the Balkans and parts of Eastern Europe, due to a legacy of centuries of Ottoman rule.

==Language==
{{Main|Languages of the European Union}}
The first official language of each of the 28 Member Countries has the status of an official language of the European Union. In total there are 24, with [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] gaining official language status on 1 January 2007, when the last two countries joined the European Union, and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] becoming official in 2013.

English is the most spoken language in the EU, being spoken by around 51% of its population. This high proportion is because 38% of EU citizens speak it as a language other than their mother tongue (i.e. [[second language|second]] or [[foreign language]]).  German is the most spoken [[first language]], spoken by more than 18% of the population.

==Demographic future==
{{Main|Ageing of Europe}}
The EU faces challenges in its demographic future. Most concerns center around several related issues: an ageing population, growing life expectancy and immigrant flow.

After hitting a historical low of 1.47 children born per female, the total fertility rate of the EU started to increase again, to reach a level of 1.60 in 2008.&lt;ref name="Eurostat"&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-01042011-BP/EN/3-01042011-BP-EN.PDF Demography Report 2010. Latest figures on the demographic challenges in the EU] Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt; The positive trend was observed in all member states with the exception of Luxembourg, Malta and Portugal. The largest increases over this period were observed in Bulgaria (from 1.23 children per woman in 2003 to 1.57 in 2009), Slovenia (from 1.20 to 1.53), the Czech Republic (from 1.18 to 1.49) and Lithuania (from 1.26 to 1.55).&lt;ref name="Eurostat"/&gt; In 2009, the Member States with the highest fertility rates were Ireland (2.06), France (2.00), Sweden (1.94), and the United Kingdom (1.90), all approaching the replacement level of 2.1 children born per female.&lt;ref name="Eurostat"/&gt; The lowest rates were observed in Latvia (1.31), Hungary and Portugal (both 1.32) and Germany (1.36). The increasing fertility rate has also been accompanied by an upward trend in the natural increase of the population which is due to the moderate increase of the crude birth rate that reached 10.9 births per 1000 inhabitants in 2008, an increase of 0.3 compared with 2007. The increase was observed in all member countries except Germany. The EU crude death rate remained stable at 9.7 per 1000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu" /&gt; The relatively low fertility rate means retirement age workers are not entirely replaced by younger workers joining the workforce. The EU faces a potential future dominated by an ever-increasing population of retired citizens, without enough younger workers to fund (via taxes) retirement programs or other state welfare agendas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/epc/epc_ageing_en.htm Economic and Financial Affairs -The Economic Policy Committee- Ageing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711055231/http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/epc/epc_ageing_en.htm |date=11 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A low fertility rate, without supplement from immigration, also suggests a declining overall EU population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/p142_en.htm |title=Regional Policy Inforegio |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which further suggests economic contraction or even a possible economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/population/Story/0,,184292,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Immigrants needed to save west from crisis | first=Michael | last=Ellison | date=22 March 2000 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some media have noted the 'baby crisis' in the EU,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4768644.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=The EU's baby blues | date=27 March 2006 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; some governments have noted the problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mettler |first=Ann |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jan2007/gb20070130_790576.htm |title=The EU's Window of Opportunity |work=BusinessWeek  |date=30 January 2007 |accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UN and other multinational authorities have warned of a possible crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/migration/eu.pdf &lt;!-- via |http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/migration/migration.htm --&gt; |title=Replacement Migration |chapter=European Union |access-date=15 February 2018 |date=21 March 2000 |id=ESA/P/WP.160 |author=United Nations Population Division |format=pdf |pages=85–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point however such a decrease in the population of the EU is not observed as the overall natural growth remains positive and the EU continues to attract large numbers of immigrants. In 2010, a breakdown of the population by citizenship showed that there were 20.1 million foreign citizens living in the EU representing 4% of the population.&lt;ref name="Eurostat"/&gt;

Over the last 50 years, life expectancy at birth in the EU27 has increased by around 10 years for both women and men, to reach 82.4 years for women and 76.4 years for men in 2008. The life expectancy at birth rose in all Member States, with the largest increases for both women and men recorded in Estonia and Slovenia.&lt;ref name="Eurostat"/&gt;

===Population projections===
In 2017, Eurostat released yearly projections up to 2080.

==Ethnic composition==
{{Main|European ethnic groups}}
There is no precise or universally accepted definition of the terms "ethnic group" or "nationality". In the context of European ethnography in particular, the terms ''ethnic group'', ''people'' (without nation state), ''nationality'', ''national minority'', ''ethnic minority'', ''linguistic community'', ''linguistic group'' and ''[[linguistic minority]]'' are used as mostly synonymous, although preference may vary in usage with respect to the situation specific to the individual [[countries of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Pan and Pfeil (2004), "Problems with Terminology", pp. xvii–xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest groups that account for about 450 million people in the European Union are:
# 
# {{flagicon|GER}} [[Germany]] (c. 83 million)
# {{flagicon|FRA}} [[France]] (c. 67 million)&lt;ref&gt;Pan and Pfeil (2004) give 55 million for the [[Francophonie|French-speaking groups]], excluding the [[Occitans]]. Recensement officiel de l'Insee [http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/docs_ffc/IP1042.pdf INSEE.fr] give 65 million.&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{flagicon|UK}} [[United Kingdom]] (c. 66 million) (includes [[English people|English]] 58&amp;nbsp;million, [[Scottish people|Scots]] 5 million, [[Welsh people|Welsh]] 3&amp;nbsp;million and [[Northern Irish people|Northern Irish]] 1.7 million){{efn|Also known as Britons. Figure includes c. 2 million British people resident in other countries in the European Union.)}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population by Country of Birth and Nationality 2013: Table 2.1|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/august-2014/rft-table-2---population-by-cob.xls|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=15 April 2015|date=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Italy]] (c. 60 million)
# {{flagicon|SPA}} [[Spain]] (c. 46 million)
# {{flagicon|POL}} [[Poland]] (c. 40 million)
# {{flagicon|ROM}} [[Romania]] (c. 20 million) (not counting [[Moldovans]] and [[Aromanians]])
# {{flagicon|NED}} [[Netherlands]] (c. 17.2 million)
# {{flagicon|BEL}} [[Belgium]] (c. 11.4 million),
# {{flagicon|GRE}} [[Greece]] (c. 11 million)
# {{flagicon|POR}} [[Portugal]] (c. 10.8 million) 
# {{flagicon|CZE}} [[Czech Republic]] (c. 10.5 million)
# {{flagicon|SWE}} [[Sweden]] (c. 10.2 million)
 
The rest are various smaller ethnic groups include [[Hungary]] (c. 9.8&amp;nbsp;million), [[Austrians]] (c. 8.8&amp;nbsp;million), [[Bulgarians]] (c. 7.1&amp;nbsp;million), [[Flemish people|Flemish]], [[Croats]], [[Slovaks]], [[Silesians]], [[Danish people|Danes]], [[Finns]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Walloons]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Slovenes]], [[Latvians]], [[Estonians]], [[Russians]], [[Maltese people|Maltese]], [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravians]], [[Frisians]] and [[Basques]].

More than 5 million ethnic groups 
# {{flagicon|HUN}} [[Hungary]] (c. 9.8 million)
# {{flagicon|AUT}} [[Austria]] (c. 8.8 million)
# {{flagicon|BUL}} [[Bulgaria]] (c. 7.1 million)
# {{flagicon|DEN}} [[Denmark]] (c. 5.8 million)
# {{flagicon|FIN}} [[Finland]] (c. 5.5 million).
# {{flagicon|SVK}} [[Slovakia]] (c. 5.4 million).

On current trends European populations will become more ethnically diverse, with the possibility that today's majority ethnic groups will no longer comprise a numerical majority in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/immigration-population-and-ethnicity-uk-international-perspective |title=Immigration, Population and Ethnicity: The UK in International Perspective - Migration Observatory - The Migration Observatory |website=Migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, almost a quarter of new EU citizens were [[Moroccans]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Ecuadorian people|Ecuadorian]] or [[Indian people|Indians]]. The new citizens in the EU27 in 2011 came mainly from Africa (26% of the total number of citizenships acquired), Asia (23%), non-EU27 Europe (19%), North and South America (17%) or another EU27 Member State (11%). In 2011, the largest groups that acquired citizenship of an EU27 Member State were citizens of Morocco (64 300 persons, of which 55% acquired citizenship of France or Spain), Turkey (48 900, 58% acquired German citizenship), Ecuador (33 700, 95% acquired Spanish citizenship) and India (31 700, 83% acquired British citizenship).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STAT-13-177_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=EU27 Member States granted citizenship to around 780,000 persons in 2011 |website=Europa.eu |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, 34.3 million foreign citizens lived in the 27 European Union member states, accounting for 6.8% of the European Union population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY.../3.../3-17072013-BP-EN.PDF ]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of whom 20.5 million were third country nationals (i.e. nationals of non-EU countries). The number of foreign-born (which includes those who have naturalised or are dual nationals) was 48.9 million or 9.7 per cent of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/futurium/en/content/evolving-trends-migration-and-multiculturalism |title=Futurium &amp;#124; FUTURIUM &amp;#124; European Commission |website=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 8.0 million citizens from European countries outside of the EU-27 were residing in the EU at the beginning of 2012; among these more than half were citizens of Turkey, Albania or Ukraine. The next biggest group was from Africa (24.5%), followed by Asia (22.0%), the Americas (14.2%) and Oceania (0.8%). Romanians (living in another EU Member State) and Turkish citizens made up the biggest groups of non-nationals living in the EU-27 in 2012. There were 4.4 million Romanian citizens living outside of Romania within the EU-27 and 2.3 million Turkish citizens living in the EU-27; each of these two groups of people accounted for 7.0% of all foreigners living in the EU-27 in 2012. The third largest group was Moroccans (1.9 million people, or 5.6% of all foreigners).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Migration_and_migrant_population_statistics |title=Statistics Explained |website=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately  20 million non-Europeans live in the EU, 4% of the overall population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europolitics.info/2011-year-of-arab-spring-and-pressure-at-greek-borders-art335646-10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217221725/http://www.europolitics.info/2011-year-of-arab-spring-and-pressure-at-greek-borders-art335646-10.html |archivedate=17 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''detour''' or ([[British English]]: '''diversion''') is a (normally temporary) route taking traffic around an area of prohibited or reduced access, such as a [[construction]] site. Standard operating procedure for many roads departments is to route any detour over roads within the same jurisdiction as the road with the obstructed area.&lt;ref&gt;Example: {{cite news |first=Joseph |last=Dits |coauthors= |title=Capital Ave. to be closed at railroad tracks in Mishawaka for a week |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/southbendtribune/access/2327206901.html?FMT=ABS |work=[[South Bend Tribune]] |publisher= |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2011-04-20 |quote=The state will erect signs that take car traffic on a detour all the way through downtown South Bend &amp;ndash; a longer detour than local residents could figure out &amp;ndash; because the state has to use state roads, said InDOT spokesman Jim Pinkerton. |format=fee required }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On multi-lane [[highway]]s (e.g., [[freeways]], [[Limited-access road|expressways]], city streets, etc.), usually [[contraflow lane reversal#Highway reconstruction|traffic shifts]] can replace a detour, as detours often congest turn lanes.

The [[fluvial landform]]s of [[stream]]s, [[stream bed]]s, and [[:Category:River valleys|river valley]]s have various landforms.

==Classification==

:There are five generic classifications:
{{anchor|consequent stream}}
*'''Consequent''' streams are streams whose course is a direct consequence of the original slope of the surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/consequent%20stream | title = consequent stream - Definitions from Dictionary.com | accessdate = 2008-04-24 | publisher = Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/St-Ts/Stream-Erosion-and-Landscape-Development.html | title = Stream Erosion and Landscape Development | accessdate = 2008-04-24 | publisher = Water: Science and Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon which it developed, i.e., streams that follow slope of the land over which they originally formed.
{{anchor|subsequent stream}}
*'''Subsequent''' streams are streams whose course has been determined by selective [[headward erosion]] along weak strata. These streams have generally developed after the original stream. Subsequent streams developed independently of the original relief of the land and generally follow paths determined by the weak rock belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/St-Ts/Stream-Erosion-and-Landscape-Development.html | title = Stream Erosion and Landscape Development | accessdate = 2008-04-24 | publisher = Water: Science and Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Resequent''' streams are streams whose course follows the original relief, but at a lower level than the original slope (e.g., flows down a course determined by the underlying strata in the same direction). These streams develop later and are generally a tributary to a subsequent stream.
*'''Obsequent''' streams are streams flowing in the opposite direction of the consequent drainage.
*'''Insequent''' streams have an almost random drainage often forming dendritic patterns. These are typically tributaries and have developed by a headward erosion on a horizontally stratified belt or on homogeneous rocks. These streams follow courses that apparently were not controlled by the original slope of the surface, its structure or the type of rock.

[[File:1europe 2001.jpg|thumb|Italy viewed from space]]
[[File:Italy Köppen.svg|thumb|300px|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of Italy]]
'''[[Italy]]''' is located in southern [[Europe]] and comprises the long, boot-shaped [[Italian Peninsula]], the southern side of Alps, the large plain of the [[Po Valley]] and some islands including [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]]. [[Corsica]], although belonging to the Italian geographical region, has been a part of France since 1769. Italy is part of the Northern Hemisphere.

Its total area is {{convert|301,340|km2|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|294,140|km2|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|7,200|km2|0|abbr=on|adj=mid|is water}}. It lies between latitudes [[35th parallel north|35°]] and [[48th parallel north|48° N]], and longitudes [[6th meridian east|6°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]].

Italy borders [[Switzerland]] ({{convert|698|km|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[France]] ({{convert|476|km|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Austria]] ({{convert|404|km|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and [[Slovenia]] ({{convert|218|km|disp=or|abbr=on}}). [[San Marino]] ({{convert|37|km|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and [[Vatican city]] ({{convert|3.4|km|disp=or|abbr=on}}) are [[enclave]]s.

Including islands, Italy has a coastline of {{convert|7,600|km|abbr=on}} on the [[Adriatic Sea]], [[Ionian Sea]], [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], [[Ligurian Sea]], [[Sea of Sardinia]] and [[Strait of Sicily]].

==Mountains and plains==
[[File:Mont Blanc from Aosta Valley.JPG|thumb|Mont Blanc seen from [[Aosta Valley]].]]
[[File:Italy topographic map-blank.svg|thumb|Topographic map of Italy]]
Almost 40% of the Italian territory is mountainous,&lt;ref name=eug92&gt;{{cite book|last=Riganti]|first=[dir. da Alberto|title=Enciclopedia universale Garzanti.|year=1991|publisher=Garzanti|location=Milano|isbn=88-11-50459-7|edition=Nuova ed. aggiornata e ampliata.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Alps]] as the northern boundary and the [[Apennine Mountains]] forming the backbone of the peninsula and extending for {{convert|1350|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=eug92 /&gt; In between the two lies a [[Po Valley|large plain]] in the valley of the [[Po River|Po]], the largest river in Italy, which flows {{convert|652|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} eastward from the [[Cottian Alps]] to the Adriatic. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy, with {{convert|46,000|km2|abbr=on}}, and it represents over 70% of the total plain area in the country.&lt;ref name=eug92 /&gt;

The Alpine mountain range is linked with the Apennines with the [[Colle di Cadibona]] pass in the [[Ligurian Alps]].

Worldwide-known mountains in Italy are Monte Cervino ([[Matterhorn]]), [[Monte Rosa]], [[Gran Paradiso]] in the West Alps, and [[Bernina Range|Bernina]], [[Stelvio Pass|Stelvio]] and [[Dolomites]] along the eastern side of the Alps. The highest peak in Italy is [[Mont Blanc]], at {{convert|4810|meters}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

===Volcanoes===
Many elements of the Italian territory are of volcanic origin. Most of the small islands and [[archipelago]]s in the south, like [[Capraia]], [[Ponza]], [[Ischia]], [[Eolie]], [[Ustica]] and [[Pantelleria]] are [[volcanic island]]s.
There are also active volcanoes: [[Mount Etna|Etna]], in [[Sicily]], the largest active volcano in Europe; [[Vulcano]], [[Stromboli]], and [[Vesuvius]], near [[Naples]], the only active volcano on mainland Europe.

==Rivers and seas==
Most of Italy's [[river]]s drain either into the Adriatic Sea (like Po, [[Piave (river)|Piave]], [[Adige]], [[Brenta (river)|Brenta]], [[Tagliamento]], [[Reno River|Reno]]) or into the Tyrrhenian (like [[Arno]], [[Tiber]] and [[Volturno]]), though the waters from some border municipalities ([[Livigno]] in [[Lombardy]], [[Innichen]] and [[Sexten]] in [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]]) drain into the [[Black Sea]] through the basin of the [[Drava]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Danube]], and the waters from the [[Lago di Lei]] in Lombardy drain into the [[North Sea]] through the basin of the [[Rhine]].

===Maritime claims===
* Territorial sea: {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}}
* Continental shelf: {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=mid|depth}} or to the depth of exploitation

==Lakes==
[[File:Altstadt von Malcesine-2.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Lake Garda]] is the largest of the [[List of lakes in Italy|Italian lakes]].]]
In the north of the country are a number of subalpine [[moraine-dammed lake|moraine-dammed]] lakes, the largest of which is [[Lake Garda|Garda]] ({{convert|370|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Other well known of these subalpine lakes are [[Lake Maggiore]] ({{convert|212.5|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), whose most northerly section is part of Switzerland, [[Como lake|Como]] ({{convert|146|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Orta lake|Orta]], [[Lugano lake|Lugano]], [[Iseo lake|Iseo]], [[Idro lake|Idro]].

Other notable lakes in the Italian peninsula are [[Trasimeno]], [[Lake Bolsena|Bolsena]], [[Lake Bracciano|Bracciano]], [[Lake Vico|Vico]], [[Lago di Varano|Varano]] and [[Lake Lesina|Lesina]] in [[Gargano]] and [[Lake Omodeo|Omodeo]] in [[Sardinia]].

==Islands==
Italy includes several islands. The largest are Sicily {{convert|25708|km2|abbr=on}} and Sardinia {{convert|24090|km2|abbr=on}}. The third largest island is [[Elba]], the largest island of the [[Tuscan Archipelago]] ({{convert|224|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

The geology of Tunisia is defined by the tectonics of North Africa, with large highlands like the Atlas Mountains as well as basins such as the Tunisian Trough. Geologists have identified rock units in the country as much as a quarter-billion years old, although most units date to the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]], in the past 250 million years. Tunisia has a small but active mining industry and a significant oil and natural gas sector. 

==Structural Geology &amp; Tectonics ==
The Tunisian Atlas mountains are a [[fold  and thrust belt]] between the [[Rifo-Tellian chain]], in the northwest (a part of the Alpine chain) and the [[Saharan platform]] in southern Tunisia. The Rifo-Tellian chain is separated from the Atlas Mountains in northern Tunisia by the [[Tunisian Trough]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedimentary units in the Tunisian Atlas mountains are divided by three regional faults: the [[Kasserine Fault]], [[Gafsa Fault]] and [[Kaala-Djerda-Sbiba Fault]]. {{sfn|Schluter |2006|p=260}}

==Stratigraphy &amp; Geologic History==
The oldest strata in Tunisia date to the [[Permian]] and are located beneath the [[Jeffara]] in [[Jebel Tebaga]], in southeastern Tunisia. They are claystone and sandstone, interbedded with limestone containing [[foraminifera]], corals and [[brachiopod]] fossils. 

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
The [[Triassic]] period is well preserved and known from outcrops in southern Tunisia and oil well drilling. The lower Triassic is defined by [[argillite]] and sandy fluvial, river sequences, overlain by a carbonate unit with palynomorphs indicating a [[Ladinian]], Middle Triassic age. The Upper Triassic is marked by the [[Messaoudi dolomite]], evidence of [[marine transgression]].  Lower and Middle Jurassic units are mainly calcareous and [[mar]]l sediments, although some from the Late Jurassic preserve a deep ocean environment with the fossils of [[radiolarians]]. 

Southwest of Jebel Zaghouan, Jurassic strata are for the most part limestones, while to the north and south dolomite sequences shift into Late Cretaceous argillites. {{sfn|Schluter |2006|p=259}} [[Paleosols]] and beds rich in plant fossils are common in Cretaceous units, which are also well preserved along with the Triassic. 

Several thousand meters of clay from the Cretaceous fill the Tunisian Trough, laden with [[ammonite]] fossils and calpionellids, an extinct species of single celled organisms, as well as sand and calcareous deposits. In central Tunisia, the [[Meloussi Formation]] is made up of marine sandstone and carbonates. The [[Boudinar Formation]] comprises fluvial sandstones with poor sorting and the Gafsa Group contains clay, sand and carbonation sequences. 

As in other places in Africa, southern Tunisia's Early Cretaceous rocks are part of the [[Continental Intercalation]]—which sometimes hold dinosaur bones. Other Cretaceous units include the [[Zebbaq Formation]], with argillite and [[gypsum]] units, the [[Aleg Formation]], with clay, marl and limestone, the [[El Haria Formation]] and [[Metlaoui Formation]]. 

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
The [[Souar Formation]] dates to the end of the [[Eocene]] and is made up of marine clay, marl, sand and gypsum. The [[Fortuna Formation]] in the [[Cap Bon]] area records the [[Oligocene]] with sandy limestone and marls, overlain by coarse sandstones and quartz pebbles, although it fades out in southern Tunisia. Other Cenozoic units include the [[Ain Grab Group]] and [[Oum Domil Formation]].  {{sfn|Schluter |2006|p=260}}

Quaternary stratigraphy, from the last 2.5 million years, includes quartz sands, rich in bivalves, as well as oolitic sands. 

==Natural resource geology==
Mining is not a significant industry in Tunisia. The country has a modest amount of phosphate mining and fertilizer production, along with aluminum fluoride, cement and gypsum. The state-owned Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa (CPG) runs all phosphate mining and processing for Tunisia, out of eight open-pit mines near Sehib and Gafsa. Bougrine and Lahdoum in northwestern Tunisia both have mining for lead and zinc. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taib, Mowafa |year=2017|title=The Mineral Industry of Tunisia|publisher=USGS|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2014/myb3-2014-ts.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil and gas production is the main form of extraction in Tunisia, although proven reserves continue to decline. Most gas is sourced from the El Borma field offshore. Ezzaiua gas field is located off the coast of the tourist area of [[Djerba Island]] while the [[Abiod Formation]] contains the Maamoura oil field in the [[Gulf of Hammamet]]. {{sfn|Schluter |2006|p=261}}

'''Glagnorra Castle''' is a fictional medieval Scottish castle referenced in the 1946 novel ''[[The Quiz Kids and the Crazy Question Mystery]]'' ([[Whitman Publishing]]) by [[Carl W. Smith]]. In that novel, Glagnorra Castle had served as a model for the early 20th century '''Grimm Castle''' in the western suburbs of [[Chicago]], Illinois, built by wealthy Chicagoan Arnold Grimm for his wife.

In the novel, the abandoned Grimm Castle is an early 20th Century replica of the larger Glagnorra Castle in [[Scotland]], located along the Spring Valley Road. It was built to full scale by wealthy Chicagoan Arnold Grimm as a wedding gift to his wife, but proved impractical as a home, being "drafty and difficult to heat", and was abandoned. A group of jewel thieves take up residence in the massive, remote structure.  A diagram of the Grimm Castle by [[Isobel Read]] is featured in the novel.

The '''Greenlandic Football Championship''' ({{lang-kl|Isikkamik Arsaalluni Pissartanngorniunneq, GM}}, {{lang-da|Grønlandsmesterskab i fodbold}}), known as the '''Coca-Cola GM''' for sponsorship reasons, is the premier [[football]] competition in [[Greenland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldfootballbadgesnews.blogspot.com/2017/11/greenland-2017-coca-cola-gm.html|title=World Football Badges News: Greenland - 2017 Coca-Cola GM|date=2017-11-05|website=World Football Badges News|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1954 and since 1971, it has been organised by the [[Football Association of Greenland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2014/oct/22/unlikely-success-story-football-greenland|title=The unlikely success story of football on the massive island of Greenland|last=Times|first=Tomos Knox for These Football|last2=Network|first2=part of the Guardian Sport|date=2014-10-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association is not apart of [[FIFA]] or any other continental confederations. [[B-67 (Nuuk)|B-67]] is the most successful football team to have won the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.holdsport.net/klub/b-67-nuuk|title=Home - B-67 Nuuk|website=www.holdsport.net|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
The championship is often called an unusual and unique [[tournament]] as the [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] GM lasts only one week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/18/football/greenland-the-worlds-shortest-football-season/index.html|title=Watching whales and icebergs -- and football?|last=CNN|first=Chris Scott,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to [[Football team|football clubs]] being so far apart in the large country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2014/oct/22/unlikely-success-story-football-greenland|title=The unlikely success story of football on the massive island of Greenland|last=Times|first=Tomos Knox for These Football|last2=Network|first2=part of the Guardian Sport|date=2014-10-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition is hosted in several different locations in Greenland. These locations include [[Ammassalik Island|Ammassalik]], [[Nanortalik]] and [[Kangaatsiaq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.footballgroundmap.com/grounds/greenland/greenlandic-football-championship|title=Greenlandic Football Championship (Host Location Changes Each Year) Football Grounds in Greenland {{!}} Football Ground Map|last=DigitalFC|website=www.footballgroundmap.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4055">The '''Grünewald''' ({{lang-lb|Gréngewald}}) is a [[forest]] in central [[Luxembourg]], most of which is owned by the national government.  Grünewald stretches through the communes of [[Niederanven]], [[Steinsel]], and [[Walferdange]]; the centre of the forest is situated {{convert|6|km|mi}} north-east of central [[Luxembourg City]].  As a result of its proximity to Luxembourg's [[capital city]], it is a popular destination for tourism, leisure, and hospitality.  Within the Grünewald are the [[source (river or stream)|sources]] of the [[Black Ernz]] and the [[White Ernz]].

==History==
The Grünewald is held in great affection by the Luxembourgian people, dating as it goes back from  the 1900 formation of the country in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="Parliamentary response"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investigateur.info/Display.pdf |title=Réponse à la question parlementaire no.1220 du 4 août 2006 de Messieurs les Députés Gast Gibéryen et Roby Mehlen |accessdate=2007-06-27 |last=Juncker |first=Jean-Claude |authorlink=Jean-Claude Juncker |coauthors= |date=15 February 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=Investigateur |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220221/http://www.investigateur.info/Display.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1846, the government proposed selling the 6.69 square kilometres (1650 [[acre]]s) remaining of the forest to raise money for economic development.  The forest was bought by Baron Ziegesar for 530,000 [[Dutch gulden|Guilders]], and presented to [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke]] [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]].&lt;ref name="Parliamentary response" /&gt;  In grand ducal possession, the Grünewald's territory was expanded greatly by a series of acquisitions.&lt;ref name="Parliamentary response" /&gt;

In 1890, however, the end of the [[personal union]] between the [[Netherlands]] and Luxembourg meant the owner of the Grünewald was no longer the Luxembourgian sovereign, but [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]].  The following year, [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke Adolphe]]. bought the forest, by now 24.43 km² (6,037 acres) in size, from the Dutch crown for 2,788,798 [[Luxembourgian franc|francs]].&lt;ref name="Parliamentary response" /&gt;  Over the following 35 years, the territory was augmented further by a series of separate purchases; during the same period, some areas of the Grünewald was sold off.&lt;ref name="Parliamentary response" /&gt;

Due to financial hardship at the height of the [[Great Depression]], in 1934, [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess Charlotte]] sold much of the Grünewald, together with [[Berg Castle]], to the Luxembourgian government.&lt;ref name="Parliamentary response" /&gt;  Of the total price tag for the two properties of 40 M francs, 20 M was denoted for the Grünewald; this was seen to have undervalued the forest (as it did the castle), as it had been assessed by the government as being worth 25 M francs.&lt;ref name="Parliamentary response" /&gt; The sale included 7.76 km² (1,920 acres) of the forest, leaving 10 km² (2,500 acres) in the hands of the Grand Duchess.&lt;ref name="Parliamentary response" /&gt;  [[Urban legend]] has it that Charlotte's husband, [[Felix of Bourbon-Parma|Prince Félix]], lost the Grünewald at a casino, but this is false; the revenue went to pay for the upkeep of the grand-ducal household, and was not spent on personal consumption, let alone gambling losses.&lt;ref name="Parliamentary response" /&gt;

Since 1934, the size of the Grünewald has fallen, mostly as a result of expansion of Luxembourg City and the construction of numerous roads in and around the area.&lt;ref name="Parliamentary response" /&gt;

'''Kan Creek''' is a [[stream]] of water flowing through Western [[Tehran]].

==Route==
Kan Creek's primary source is from the west of [[Tochal]]. The creek navigates downstream to Kan village and Metropolitan [[Tehran]] passing by [[Eram Park]] and [[Azadi Sport Complex]] until reaching the southern outskirts of Tehran where the stream dries. Parts of [[Hemmat Expressway]], [[Freeway 2 (Iran)]], [[Freeway 5 (Iran)]] and [[Mehrabad Airport]] are built over the creek's course.

==Revitalization==
As part of a shared development between the municipalities of district 5 and 22 of Tehran, a distance of {{convert|5400|m|mi}} of the creek's course between [[Hemmat Expressway]] and [[Freeway 2 (Iran)]] is being converted into a recreational park. The creek's bed and banks are also planned to be encased by heavy stones and concrete. Tehran's district 22 municipality has considered Kan Creek a primary source of water for the currently under construction [[Chitgar]] Lake, the stream will provide 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the artificial lake's inflow.&lt;ref&gt;Green Prophet http://www.greenprophet.com/2010/11/tehran-iran-lake-artificial/ "Iran to Construct Middle East’s Largest Artificial Lake in Tehran" accessed February 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kelani River''' ({{lang-si|'''කැළණි ගඟ'''}}) is a {{convert|145|km|mi|adj=mid|-long|0}} river in [[Sri Lanka]]. Ranking as the fourth-longest river in the country, it stretches from the [[Sri Pada|Sri Pada Mountain Range]] to [[Colombo]]. It flows through or bordering the Sri Lankan districts of Nuwara Eliya, Ratnapura, Kegalle, Gampaha and Colombo.The kelani also river flows through the capital of Sri Lanka,Colombo and provides 80%of its drinking water.

==Hydrology==
Kelani River has two main tributaries in its upper reaches. These are; (1) Kehelgamu Oya and (2) Maskeli Oya. These two contribute to part of hydro-electric production in Sri Lanka, by housing several major reservoirs, ponds and power stations. [[Castlereigh Dam|Castlereigh Reservoir]] and [[Norton Dam|Norton Reservoir]] are constructed across [[Kehelgamu Oya]], while [[Maskeliya Reservoir]], [[Canyon Dam (Sri Lanka)|Canyon Reservoir]] and [[Laxapana Reservoir]] are constructed across Maskeli Oya. In its lower reaches, some more tributaries connect to Kelani River out of which the most famous are We Oya at Yatiyanthota, Gurugoda Oya at Ruwanwella and Seethawaka Ganga at Avissawella.

==Hydrometry and usage==
It supplies approximately 80% of the water used in [[Colombo]]. In addition, the river is used for [[transport]], [[fisheries]], [[sewage disposal]], [[sand mining]] and for production of [[hydroelectricity]]. Through these factors, many people depend on the river for their daily routine in life. Depending on the operation of three [[reservoir]]s, the river flow varies from {{convert|20|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|25|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on}} in the dry seasons, and {{convert|800|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1500|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on}} during the [[Monsoon#South Asian monsoon|monsoons]]. The annual sand extraction from the river is approximately {{convert|600000|m2|ft2|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|800000|m2|ft2|0|abbr=on}}. From a [[barge]], people dive to the river bed, from where the sand is lifted to the barge in a bucket, and when the barge is full, it is taken to the [[river bank]] and unloaded by a separate team. The sand mining causes the river bed to sink by approximately {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year. At present, two main concerns in connection with the river are flooding during the [[monsoon]] and saline intrusion in the dry season.

In addition, Kelani River water levels affect the flood risk to Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka, to a considerable extent. One reason is that part of the city and suburbs of Colombo lie on the lower flood plain of the river. Exposure of Colombo and upper catchments of Kelani River to the same monsoon, i.e. South West Monsoon, is another reason.

The problems are related: the saline intrusion is enhanced by the deepening of the river caused by the sand mining. Regulation in order to prevent the saline intrusion can reduce the water quality in other ways, and can increase the flood risk. Sand mining is economically important nationally and to the many involved people.

The Kelani stream flow was investigated just upstream of Ambatale at [[Hanwella]], analyzing the river discharges from 1973 to 2004 (in million m³/month).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://enviroscope.iges.or.jp/modules/envirolib/upload/981/attach/08_chapter3-5srilanka.pdf|title=The Study of the Management of Groundwater Resources in Sri Lanka|format= PDF; 1,8&amp;nbsp;MB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
Kelani River is connected closely with the Sinhala Buddhist culture of Sri Lanka, especially with the people living on the area identified as Kelani Valley. This is primarily caused by the fact that Kelani River is associated with two of the most venerated Buddhist shrines and pilgrimages, i.e. [[Adam's Peak|Sri Pada Mountain]] and Kelani Raja Maha Viharaya. There are a number of folk poetry that mention Kelani River such as the following:&lt;br&gt;
1.&lt;br&gt;
මලේ මලේ ඔය නා මල නෙළා වරෙන්&lt;br&gt;
අත්ත බිඳෙයි පය බුරුලෙන් තබා වරෙන්&lt;br&gt;
කැලණි ගඟේ ඔරු යනවා බලා වරෙන්&lt;br&gt;
සාදුකාර දී ඔරුවක නැගී වරෙන්&lt;br&gt;
2.&lt;br&gt;
මහවැලි කැලණි කලු වලවේ යන ගංගා&lt;br&gt;
සමනොළ කන්ද මුදුනේ සිට පැන නැංගා&lt;br&gt;
බෑවුම් තැනිතලා හෙල් අතරින් රිංගා&lt;br&gt;
මේවා ගලයි මිණි කැට දිය යට හංගා

3. හංස සන්දේශ කරුවා කැළණි ගඟ දුටු අයුරු
සමනොළ මුදුන සිරිපද ඔබන    මගුලට
නිකසල මහ සඟන ගෙන වඩින  මුනිඳුට
පැහැදුල සුනිල් මිණියෙන් කළ මග ලෙසට
මනදොළ පිරෙයි ගඟ සිරිසර දුටු තොපට

==Special features==
The [[30th Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' was filmed on the Kelani River near [[Kitulgala]], although nothing remains now except the concrete foundations for the bridge (and, supposedly, the submerged train cars that plunged into the river in the climactic scene).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankafirst.de/highlights/attractions/kitulgala.htm Sri Lanka für Fortgeschrittene]&lt;/ref&gt;

==L==

The DST column shows the months in which Daylight Saving Time, a.k.a. Summer Time, begins and ends. A blank DST box usually indicates that the location stays on Standard Time all year, although in some cases the location stays on Summer Time all year. If a location is currently on DST, add one hour to the time in the Time column.

This is a list of [[butterfly|butterflies]] of [[New Caledonia]]. The total number of [[Lepidoptera]] species on New Caledonia is 521 in 304 genera (with 197 endemic species in 17 genera).&lt;ref name = biod&gt;[http://www.uicn.fr/IMG/pdf/11_UICN_2003_Biodiv_OM_-_Nouvelle_Caledonie.pdf biodiversité et conservatoire en Outre-Mer]&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of butterflies is 72 in 42 genera.&lt;ref name=basebiodiv&gt;[http://www.ird.nc/BASE/BIODIVERSITE/orig-dta/papillon/classes.html base biodiversité en Nouvelle-Calédonie] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130221100835/http://www.ird.nc/BASE/BIODIVERSITE/orig-dta/papillon/classes.html |date=2013-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Windows Vista]] contains many [[Features new to Windows Vista|new features]], a number of capabilities and certain programs that were a part of previous Windows versions up to [[Windows XP]] were removed or changed – some of which were later re-introduced in [[Windows 7]].

The following is a list of features which were present in Windows XP but were removed in Windows Vista.

==Windows Explorer==
*[[Windows Briefcase]] no longer allows synchronizing items across multiple computers and a removable media device.
*''Windows Briefcase'' cannot sync files or folders in locations protected by [[User Account Control]]. This removes the ability to sync many locations.
*Grouping items by name in Explorer no longer groups them under each individual letter of the alphabet (A, B, C... Z) like Windows XP Explorer. When using Group By Name, items are always combined into just a few groups (A-H, I-P, Q-Z). This removes the ability to locate items by their starting alphabet.
*If hidden files are not allowed to be shown in [[Windows Explorer]], the Status bar does not report how many hidden files are present. In addition, if all items within a folder are selected at once (by pressing {{keypress|[[Control key|Ctrl]]|A}} or ''Select all''), the user is not alerted to hidden files being selected.
*Even after setting the ''ForceCopyAclwithFile'' and ''MoveSecurityAttributes'' values as documented in KB310316,&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310316 How permissions are handled when you copy and move files and folders]&lt;/ref&gt; permissions are not retained/copied when Windows Explorer is used to copy or move objects across volumes or in the same volume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprosecurity/thread/c8a5034e-250f-459a-9ff8-c74ba9121abd MoveSecurityAttributes not working under Windows 7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/da-DK/winserverfiles/thread/d7d2d24a-c02a-428b-8cf7-595e2e6b4989 Permission settings on a folder not being respected]&lt;/ref&gt; A hotfix is available (KB2617058) to restore the ''MoveSecurityAttributes'' value but not ''ForceCopyAclwithFile''.
*Thumbnails can no longer be forced to regenerate by right-clicking the image and selecting ''Refresh thumbnail''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprogeneral/thread/3d37b5ab-5592-4eff-9082-cf25ec9e31da How do I refresh thumbnails in Windows 7?]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Thumbnail support for .HTM, .HTML, .MHT and .URL files has been removed in Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aveapps.com/htmlpreviews.html HTML Explorer Thumbnails]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Explorer thumbnail handler and metadata property handler for &lt;tt&gt;.AVI&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;.WAV&lt;/tt&gt; files (''Shmedia.dll'') has been removed.
*Ctrl+Enter on the selected folder no longer opens it in a new Explorer window.
*Tiles view only shows the name, type and the size of items. It no longer shows information depending on the criteria by which items are sorted.
*The ''Version'' file properties tab has been replaced by a ''Details'' tab that omits custom version information strings, does not show all of the same information as the ''Version'' tab and does not support copying any of the displayed information to the clipboard.
*Various properties are not visible anymore from the ''Details'' tab, such as ''Audio sample rate'' and ''Audio sample size''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explorer: View: Choose Details: Audio Sample Rate and Audio Sample Size are not available within the list of Choose Details.|date= October 8, 2009|work=Microsoft Answers|url=http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-files/explorer-view-choose-details-audio-sample-rate-and/bdf58ca8-6434-4115-8f21-1a7350b540c3|accessdate=August 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Channels'' for certain audio files.
*The column by which items are sorted is not highlighted unlike Windows XP. Only the column header is highlighted.
* The address bar dropdown displays recently visited folder or file paths typed into the address bar and websites but does not show the complete top level file hierarchy.
* Right clicking on the top-left icon of the Explorer window no longer shows the context menu for that folder. It instead shows the window menu just like left click or Alt+Space does.
* The top-left corner of the window no longer acts like a draggable icon representing the folder.
* The ''Desktop.ini'' &lt;code&gt;Sharing=0&lt;/code&gt; parameter which could prevent a particular folder from being shared is not supported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144102(VS.85).aspx Customizing Folders with Desktop.ini]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Up'' toolbar button in Windows Explorer, which allowed one to jump to a parent folder in the address hierarchy has been removed. As a result of this, the {{keypress|Ctrl|[[Arrow keys|Up]]}} key combination to open the parent folder in a new window does not work. The keyboard shortcut, {{keypress|[[Alt key|Alt]]|Up}}, is still available. The link to the parent folder in the ''Other places'' task pane has also been removed. The new method of viewing parent folders is to click the respective folder or its dropdown arrow from the [[Breadcrumb (navigation)|breadcrumbs bar]].
* It is not possible to turn off full row selection in ''List view''.
* It is not possible to turn off autorefresh/autosorting of files and folders as sorting is treated as a state instead of as a verb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/09/10162286.aspx Sorting is a state and a verb (and a floor wax and a dessert topping)]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, any file modification activity such as copy-paste, creation, rename or deletion makes items move continually to obey the sort order instead of the items appearing at the end and getting sorted only when the view is refreshed.
* It is not possible to set NTFS security ACLs, ownership and audit permissions on more than one selected item using Windows Explorer because the ''Security'' tab has been removed from the ''Properties'' for multiple selected items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/itprovistadesktopui/thread/50dd7046-c920-481a-9b47-19e0acafc561/ Vista feature regression: "security tab" missing for multiple selections in Explorer properties]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vistax64.com/vista-general/27081-modify-multiple-files-ntfs-permission.html Modify Multiple files' NTFS permission]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techsupportforum.com/microsoft-support/windows-vista-support/153196-folder-permissions.html Folder permissions]&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft states that this feature was removed as the UAC prompt which may need to be displayed to gain ownership and reset permissions cannot accommodate the names of multiple selected files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/04/07/9991494.aspx How to edit the security attributes of more than one file at a time]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this justification would also apply to all other batch actions on multiple selected files such as setting attributes, using NTFS compression or Encrypting File System where a different UAC prompt is displayed and the batch action is not disallowed.
* The IColumnProvider shell extension interface (column handler) has been removed. Shell extensions that display information in Explorer's columns will therefore fail to work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776147.aspx IColumnProvider Interface on MSDN]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this API removed, folder sizes cannot be displayed in a column in Windows Explorer Details view. The replacement for column handlers, ''Property Handlers'', cannot be registered for all files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.platformsdk.shell/browse_thread/thread/e79555b9910c5f68/68c74675b24c8da9?pli=1 Vista Property Handler for each file stored on mapped drive]&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is no longer possible to add a background to folders via a desktop.ini.
* Icons of any [[16-bit]] files including [[New Executable]]s or DLLs are not extracted by Explorer (or any other 32-bit process) even in 32-bit versions, and therefore are not displayed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.05.windowsconfidential.aspx 16-Bit Icons Are So Passé: Windows Confidential – TechNet Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; The shell's ''Change icon'' dialog cannot browse 16-bit icon libraries and DLLs.
* The collapsible ''File and Folder Tasks'' pane actions have been replaced by the ''Organize'' menu which requires an additional click after selecting items.
* The navigation pane (tree view) can only be toggled through the Organize menu. The ''Folders'' button has been removed.
* The Favorites menu has been removed from Explorer and replaced by Explorer-specific Favorite Links in the folder navigation pane (tree view). Favorites can now only store folder location shortcuts, unlike the Favorites menu in Windows XP which also supported program and file shortcuts.
* The ability to view and edit [[metadata]] at the file system level – such as description, author, tags, rating etc. stored in a file's [[NTFS#Alternate data streams (ADS)|secondary stream]] – through the "Summary" tab of the file's "Properties" dialog was removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa969361.aspx MSDN: Property System]&lt;/ref&gt; Metadata is now stored inside files; however, developers must write a ''Property handler'' for any file format in order for users to be able to edit and view its metadata.
* There are limitations to opening more than 15 selected files in a single operation, i.e. by selecting more than 15 files and pressing Enter.  The "Open" verb is not present in the context menu when more than 15 files are selected.
* Single click to rename after selecting an item is not available in the navigation (left) pane.
* Arrows indicating subfolders in the left pane cannot be set to always show. They disappear when dragging and dropping if the user clicks in the right pane before starting to drag to the left pane.
* A folder tree does not expand automatically while collapsing the previous one in the navigation pane even after turning on "Display simple folder view".&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282002 Description of Simple Folder View in Windows XP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/313066/explorer-should-expand-folder-tree-the-windows-xp-way |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911092027/http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/313066/explorer-should-expand-folder-tree-the-windows-xp-way |archivedate=2012-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/thread-3776411.php Microsoft is trashing Windows Explorer]&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is not possible to display the full path in the [[title bar]] when [[Windows Aero|Aero Glass]] is enabled. When Aero Glass is disabled, the full path can be displayed in the title bar. The full path can be shown in the [[address bar]] regardless of the status of Aero, by clicking to the right of the [[Breadcrumb (navigation)|breadcrumbs]] or pressing Alt+D.
* The ability to customize the standard toolbar's layout and buttons was removed.
* Users can no longer make the menu above all other toolbars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geeksaresexy.blogspot.com/2006/11/moving-your-ie7-menu-bar-back-to-top.html Registry hack allows menubar to be top toolbar in IE7, not available for Explorer]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ability to add a password to a ZIP file (compressed folder) has been removed. Though this has no effect on third-party compression tools, such as [[WinZip]] or [[7-Zip]], Windows Explorer can no longer open ZIP files that are protected with a password.
* ''Filmstrip view'' is replaced by the ''Preview pane''; however the state of the preview pane is not saved per folder. It can be globally enabled or disabled. Also, the preview pane does not show previews for folders whereas filmstrip view showed the preview of images within a folder if a folder was selected. Other functions available in filmstrip view such as rotating photos and navigating using Next and Forward buttons are only available in [[Windows Photo Gallery]].
* Support for enabling a folder for web sharing with [[Internet Information Services]] via the Windows Explorer interface was removed.
* The "Computer Description" field is no longer shown on the Explorer view of a workgroup. It can be viewed from the command line using ''net view''.
* The Status bar does not show file information shown in the infotips when the file is selected. It no longer shows the total space used by a folder when displaying a folder's contents. Some file information is displayed in the Details pane.
* The drive mapping dialog box no longer allows a [[path (computing)|network path]] to be mapped without assigning a local drive letter to it.
* It is not possible to view the ''Properties'' of an item in the left pane of Windows Explorer using ''Alt+Enter''.
* Users can no longer browse a domain or workgroup through a tree view. All computers on the network are displayed in a unified list. The list can be "filtered" to display only computers from the desired domain, but the list is still populated with all computers on the network, slowing the process.
* The ability to undo more than one delete operation has been removed from the Explorer context menu. Only the last delete operation can be undone or redone.&lt;ref&gt;One can still undo/redo multiple renames, moves and copy operations from the context menu and older deletes can be undone from the [[Recycle Bin (Windows)|recycling bin]] or through use of [[Shadow Copy|previous version feature]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The file transfer dialogs for copying, moving or deleting do not show the actual file name which is being copied, moved or deleted at that instant.
* The ''File Types'' tab has been removed from ''Folder Options''. This feature was available from Windows 95 up to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. The ''File Types'' tab allowed users to change the [[file association]]s for various types of files. It allowed configuring which application would open when a user clicked on a certain type of file, or allowed manually defining a new file extension, defining/editing custom secondary actions, showing extensions only for specific file types, or customizing the file icon. While there is a more simplified option to change the [[file association]]s, called ''Default Programs'' in the Windows Vista Control Panel, this option only allows users to change the default action that occurs when they double click a file. It does not allow users to choose which application would load if the user were to right click on a file and then choose a secondary option such as ''Edit''. Manual registry editing or third-party software is now required to choose default programs, change file type icons, and other advanced tasks. The ''Open With'' dialog box in Windows Vista also uses the corresponding ''Default Programs'' API which limits only one registered application to be set as the default program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2006/09/11/Managing-Defaults-in-Windows.aspx File types tab removed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302104625/http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2006/09/11/Managing-Defaults-in-Windows.aspx |date=2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The option on the File Types tab to configure particular file types to confirm open after download and others to open without confirmation after downloading has been removed.
* Folders can only display two 3D thumbnails of files within a folder. Previously, up to four 2D images could be shown.

==Taskbar==
* The ''Power'' icon on the taskbar only appears for laptops and desktop computers with a USB-based [[Uninterruptible power supply|UPS]].
* The ''Network'' icon on the taskbar does not give direct access to the connection settings, connection status, firewall settings, or disabling the connection.
* The [[taskbar]] cannot be resized to zero height, hiding it manually (inexperienced users were often unable to continue using Windows after resizing the taskbar to zero height accidentally{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}).
* Toolbars such as "Quick Launch" can no longer be "dragged off" the taskbar as floating minibars or docked to another edge of the screen, though physical folders can be dragged onto the desktop edge in a similar manner. The [[Language Bar]] is the only toolbar that can float on the desktop.
* Double clicking on the Printer icon in the notification area while printing does not open the printer's status window that allows managing print jobs.

== Start menu ==
* Neither the new nor the Classic Start menu shows infotips for folders stored inside the folder's ''desktop.ini''.
* The ''All Programs'' mode has changed to an inline scrollable menu. As such, it is not possible to expand the ''All Programs'' menu in the Vista Start menu into flyout cascading menus.
* Subfolders inside the ''All Programs'' menu in the Vista Start menu cannot be opened in Windows Explorer by double clicking as was possible with the XP Start menu or Classic Start menu. They also do not expand automatically if the mouse hovers over them (unless working in Windows Classic mode).
* Holding down the &lt;tt&gt;SHIFT&lt;/tt&gt; key while clicking an item to retain the Start menu is not possible in the Vista Start menu.
* The Vista Start Menu does not allow expanding ''Connect To'' and ''Printers'' for quick access to network connections or print/fax devices.
* The ''Log Off'' confirmation on the classic Start menu has been removed.

==Other Windows shell and usability features==
* The setting to configure Recycle Bin maximum allocated size globally (across all drives) has been removed and the equivalent Group Policy is not supported. Recycle Bin maximum size must be configured individually for each drive in MB.
* Some functionality of the shell namespace extension for the ''Downloaded Program Files'' folder which hosts [[ActiveX control]]s is broken. ActiveX controls no longer show "Update" and "Delete" context menu verbs when right clicked. As a result, they can no longer be updated or deleted using the ''Downloaded Program Files'' folder.
* Folders and sub-folders placed inside the ''Send To'' menu will no longer cascade i.e. expand as submenus. As a result, it is not possible to group items in the SendTo menu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/windowsgeneraldevelopmentissues/thread/952116de-07b6-493f-a1fc-643cf8ede2e7 Why did Vista remove hierarchical SendTo menu items in context menu?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* AutoPlay settings cannot be configured per device; they are set globally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc162493(TechNet.10).aspx TechNet Magazine – Windows Confidential: Looking Smart by Being Stupid]&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is not possible to list fonts by similarity based on [[PANOSE]] information or hide font variations such as ''Bold'', ''Italic'', etc. in the Fonts folder.
* The option to switch between the [[Windows 2000]]/[[Windows XP|XP]] style "Fade" animation for menus and tooltips and the [[Windows 98]]/[[Windows ME|Me]] style "Scroll" animation has been removed. However, it is still possible to switch between the two options by [[Windows Registry|registry editing]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcreview.co.uk/threads/switching-between-fade-and-scroll-effects-in-windows-vista.3032542/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some functions such as shell execute hooks and named exports have been deprecated or removed from [[Windows Shell|shell32.dll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb775101(VS.85).aspx|title=IShellExecuteHook Interface|accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://peter.hahndorf.eu/blog/PermaLink,guid,d7430964-f75c-45e8-aca8-0586efc7c48a.aspx File Manager doesn't run in Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Windows Script Host]] WshShell.SendKeys() method, as well as the SendKeys() function in development environments such as [[Visual Basic 6]], no longer work on Vista when [[User Account Control|UAC]] is enabled.  Version 3.0 of the [[.NET Framework]] has been updated to work around the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171548(VS.80).aspx|title=How to: Simulate Mouse and Keyboard Events in Code|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is no longer possible to copy text fragments and other similar objects from a document, and paste them to a folder as a file (called a shell scrap object or "Document shortcut", but actually an OLE object).&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc194424.aspx Scrapping the scraps]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Active Desktop]] functionality has been removed. As a result, animated [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] files can no longer be set as the desktop background. No other dynamic web content such as [[HTML]] or [[HTML Application|HTA]] files can run on the desktop, although [[Windows DreamScene]] (released only for Windows Vista Ultimate) allows using videos as the background and dynamic web content can run as part of [[Windows Sidebar|Sidebar]] [[Microsoft Gadgets|gadgets]].
* The ''Snap To'' mouse pointer option to move the pointer automatically to the ''default button'' in a dialog is broken on many system and application dialog boxes and windows in Windows Vista and later. The mouse pointer simply does not move or ''snap to'' the default button in several dialogs.

==Search==
* Unlike the search feature in Windows XP, [[Windows Search]] does not display information about the location being searched in the status bar of Windows Explorer.
* It is not possible to perform a case sensitive search using [[Windows Search]].
* Unlike the search feature in Windows XP, [[Windows Search]] no longer searches an item's [[NTFS]] [[Alternate Data Stream]].
* The Search Companion is no longer available.

== Internet Explorer ==
* The ''About Internet Explorer'' dialog no longer displays the latest installed cumulative update in the "Update Versions" field. This is corrected in Internet Explorer 9 and later.
* The ability to customize the toolbar layout is removed. The position of the address bar and the 'command bar' cannot be readjusted.
* Internet Explorer is no longer integrated with [[Windows Explorer]]. This can also be seen in [[Internet Explorer 7]]/8 on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
* Image toolbar has been removed. Most of the commands that were on this floating toolbar – Save Picture, E-mail Picture, Set as Background, etc. – are now in the context menu that appears when an image is right-clicked. This is same for users with Internet Explorer 7 or higher on other supported Windows versions.
* Offline Favorites, a feature that automatically synchronized and stored web pages for later perusal when not online, was removed in favor of using [[RSS]] feeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The maximum size for the "[[Temporary Internet Files]]" folder (downloaded files cache) is limited to 1024 MB in Internet Explorer 7. This also applies for Internet Explorer 7 on other Windows versions.
* Several old and little-used technologies have been removed:&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/aa740486.aspx Release Notes for Internet Explorer 7]&lt;/ref&gt; [[DirectX Media|DirectAnimation]] support, [[Channel Definition Format|CDF]], view-source protocol handlers and 40-bit [[Secure Socket Layer|SSL]] [[Encryption|ciphers]].

==User accounts and winlogon.exe configuration==
* It is no longer possible to safely relocate the profiles directory (C:\Users) to another partition without using unsupported methods. Microsoft recommends against moving the user profile folder. In Windows XP, the WinNT.sif file allowed relocating "Documents and Settings" to another partition than C: before Windows installation completed. Subfolders under the user's profile can however still be redirected. Windows 7 further alleviates this issue by introducing Libraries which allow user's data to be located on another partition.
* [[Windows Installer]] and the Shell in Windows Vista do not support per-user app installs without the need to show the UAC prompt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa367559.aspx ALLUSERS property]&lt;/ref&gt; This has been corrected in [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windows_installer_team/archive/2009/09/02/authoring-a-single-package-for-per-user-or-per-machine-installation-context-in-windows-7.aspx Authoring a single package for Per-User or Per-Machine Installation context in Windows 7]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Winlogon]] no longer shows details of password complexity policy requirements due to the removal of [[Graphical identification and authentication|GINA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/itprovistasecurity/thread/1440ff2b-e9b5-47b2-ab8b-2e4cb845c9b2 Change/Modify/Edit the failed Password Complexity dialog]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Biologon API to programmatically create a new interactive user session using the InitiateInteractiveLogon function has been removed.
* Unlike Windows XP, an administrator can no longer unlock the computer when another standard user has locked it.
* Protected Storage (PStore) has been deprecated and therefore made read-only in Windows Vista. Microsoft recommends using [[DPAPI]] to add new PStore data items or manage existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480152.aspx#appcomp_topic25 SPAP Deprecation (PStore)]&lt;/ref&gt; However existing applications such as [[Microsoft Office XP|Outlook 2002]] which used PStore are unable to save passwords as a result. Any application that tries to create new PStore data items will fail.
* Although classic logon and Ctrl+Alt+Del enforcement can be enabled through [[Group Policy]], the classic logon prompt cannot be made to appear by pressing &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl+Alt+Del&lt;/tt&gt; at the Welcome screen twice. This makes it impossible to logon to a hidden user account while the Welcome screen is enabled (when Classic Logon is not enforced through Group Policy).
* Because of the classic logon being removed, [[Windows Server domain|domain]] names are no longer populated on the logon screen and cannot be selected from a drop down list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/12009443/m/921001700931?f=12009443&amp;a=tpc&amp;m=921001700931&amp;s=50009562 Vista logon screen does not have drop down menu to pick domains]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://serverfault.com/questions/59289/how-to-enable-domain-select-on-vista-logon-screen |title= How to enable domain select on Vista logon screen? |date= 26 August 2009  |work= [[Server Fault]] |publisher= |accessdate= 2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ability to run a Control Panel applet as a different user by using Shift+Right click has been removed.
* It is not possible to override Autologon and Startup items by pressing the &lt;code&gt;SHIFT&lt;/code&gt; key before logon. The ''IgnoreShiftOverride'' registry value is ignored. (This problem may be unique to USB keyboards; see [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/977534 KB977534], [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2526967 KB2526967])
* [[16-bit]] applications launched with administrator-level privileges always run in their own memory space, even if launched via "Start /Shared" on the command line or if the CREATE_SEPARATE_WOW_VDM flag is specified with the CreateProcess() API; 16-bit [[inter-process communication]] therefore only works for non-elevated processes, as these can still be configured to run in the same memory space.
* The [[runas|RunAs]] feature in the shell has been replaced with "Run as administrator" of User Account Control. The RunAs feature does not allow a local administrator-equivalent command shell to be started except for the Administrator account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/library/7b710f79-d28a-4297-b5fc-0c1868d236fc1033.mspx?mfr=true|title=Runas|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Internet Explorer can no longer be launched from a command prompt started with alternate credentials using RunAs.  This is also true for Internet Explorer 7 running under Windows XP (it can, but you must type the complete path to the executable, not just IEXPLORE or IEXPLORE.EXE).
* When [[User Account Control]] is enabled, any process started with Administrator-level privileges does not inherit the [[drive mapping]]s of the interactively logged on user, despite the same account being used.  This can lead to scenarios where non-UAC processes such as Windows Explorer have access to an application on a network drive, but insufficient permissions to execute it; conversely, the UAC-elevated process has sufficient local permissions, but cannot see the network application.
* The [[Graphical identification and authentication|GINA]] library and support for GINA-based authentication has been replaced with Credential Providers so that authentication plug-ins are moved out of the [[Winlogon]] process space to the fullest extent possible in order to provide more reliability and consistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsvistasecurity/archive/2006/08/25/724271.aspx|title=New Authentication Functionality in Windows Vista: GINAs Replaced with New Credential Providers|date=August 25, 2006|accessdate=2008-03-18|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163489.aspx Credential Providers in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, third-party GINA modules must be ported to the Credential Provider model. Credential providers however do not allow customization which GINA allowed. For example, it does not support programmatically using [[Fast User Switching]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remkoweijnen.nl/blog/2008/11/26/executing-a-fast-user-switch-programmatically-part-2/comment-page-1/#comment-1281 Executing a Fast User Switch programmatically – part 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Winlogon]] Notification Packages are no longer supported in Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc721961(WS.10).aspx Winlogon Notification Packages Removed: Impact on Windows Vista Planning and Deployment]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The logon screen does not show the number of running programs or unread email messages when using [[Fast User Switching]].
* The ''All Users'' wallpaper can no longer be changed. All Windows Vista machines now show the same wallpaper at the logon screen.
* Due to security concerns, the ''All Users'' [[screen saver]] can no longer be changed. (Replacing the screen saver was a common method of unauthorized [[privilege escalation]] in earlier versions of Windows.)
* Due to security concerns, system services can no longer natively interact with the user's desktop in Windows Vista. This is a change from all previous NT releases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itsvista.com/2007/04/interactive-services-detection/ Vista's Interactive Services Detection Service | ITsVISTA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cached [[roaming user profile|roaming profiles]] cannot be deleted directly from the file system as this renders the account unable to logon to the workstation again, even if the account is also removed from "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList".  The only supported method of manually deleting a roaming profile is via the System applet of the [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] or via the commandline DelProf utility, which uses the DeleteProfile() API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb762273(VS.85).aspx|title=DeleteProfile Function|accessdate=2008-08-24|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953529|title=The folder redirection process fails on a computer that is running Windows Vista or Windows XP when you change the user name in Active Directory|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "Network Configuration Operators" built-in group no longer delegates permissions to manage system network connections; only system-wide administrator-level permissions can now be used to achieve this.  Operations like the "Repair" action of a network connection can therefore be carried out by an administrator only.
* The ability to change the stored password of a [[Windows Server domain|domain]] in ''Stored User Names and Passwords'' while the computer is connected to a workgroup has been removed.
* The ''Stored User Names and Passwords'' credential manager does not accept the &lt;Domain&gt;\* syntax which allowed users to wildcard all passwords in a domain.

== Win32 console ==
* The [[Windows Display Driver Model]] (WDDM) does not support all DOS video modes and therefore DOS-based and [[Win32 console]] programs cannot run in full screen mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/926657 Some 16-bit DOS-based Programs and the Command Prompt will not run in full-screen mode in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt; If Windows XP Driver Model graphics drivers are installed, console programs can be run full-screen, however, [[Windows Aero]] is not available.
* In previous versions of Windows, it was possible to save different settings for each console window. Windows would ask the user whether to apply settings for the current window or the shortcut that started the window. Windows Vista, however, saves settings for all console windows without asking the user.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vistax64.com/vista-general/80745-re-command-prompt-properties.html Command Prompt Properties]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dragging and dropping a folder or file into a [[Win32 console]] window no longer pastes the path of the folder or file.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petri.co.il/missing_drag_and_drop_vista_command_prompt.htm Missing Drag and Drop in Vista Command Prompt]&lt;/ref&gt; This no longer works as a result of [[User Interface Privilege Isolation]].

==Graphics==
* When using [[Windows Aero]], all [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]], GDI+ and DirectDraw applications run in the new [[compositing window manager]] known as [[Desktop Window Manager]]. The GDI or DirectDraw render paths are redirected through DWM; however GDI or DirectDraw are not [[hardware acceleration|hardware-accelerated]] when they are redirected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/greg_schechter/archive/2006/03/10/549310.aspx GDI is not hardware accelerated in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Windows Display Driver Model]] specification does not support horizontal and vertical desktop spanned modes, that is, stretching the desktop across multiple monitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nvidia.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/nvidia.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2026 Are there Control Panel features that were available under Windows XP that are no longer available on Windows Vista?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.amd.com/us/kbarticles/Pages/26771-stretched-mode-Catalyst-Control-Center.aspx Stretched Desktop or Spanning Mode Not Available in Catalyst Control Center Under Windows Vista] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117203732/http://support.amd.com/us/kbarticles/Pages/26771-stretched-mode-Catalyst-Control-Center.aspx |date=2009-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although ''Dual View''&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283674 Description of DualView in Windows XP]&lt;/ref&gt; is still available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/multimonVista.mspx MultiMonitor Support and Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Windows Vista, the [[Windows Display Driver Model]] (WDDM) does not support two different display adapters. When using two display adapters, both must use the same WDDM driver. Although Windows Vista still supports XPDM drivers, a WDDM driver is required for the [[Windows Aero]] user experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/multimonVista.mspx#EOB MultiMonitor Support and Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480220.aspx Windows Vista Display Driver Model]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Windows Vista restricts the amount of memory [[DOS Protected Mode Interface|DPMI]] programs can have to 32 MB (33,554,432 bytes). The limitation applies to DPMI programs running inside [[Virtual DOS machine|NTVDM]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trnicely.net/misc/vista.html Windows Vista restricts non-Win32 apps to 32 MB of memory]&lt;/ref&gt; The same is not true for previous versions of Windows.
* For certain CRT monitors, Windows Vista and later no longer support refresh rates higher than 85&amp;nbsp;Hz.

==Audio==
* The ability to choose a different hardware or software [[MIDI]] synthesizer other than the default [[Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth]] has been removed from the user interface for audio configuration in Windows Vista. A different output MIDI synth or output device port can be selected only by editing the [[Windows Registry|registry]] or using third party MIDI default output device configuration tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.creative.com/creativelabs/board/message?board.id=Vista&amp;message.id=7749 MIDI and Windows Vista] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913180424/http://forums.creative.com/creativelabs/board/message?board.id=Vista&amp;message.id=7749 |date=2007-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/archive/b/windowsvista/archive/2006/12/06/audio-improvements-in-windows-vista.aspx Audio improvements in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the default MIDI output device is changed, not all programs that use [[Multimedia Extensions|waveOut MME]] use the selected MIDI synth; they continue to use the default MS Software Synth. Also, not all MIDI synths are compatible with Windows Vista and later Windows versions.
* As [[DirectMusic]] was based on [[DirectSound]] which was hardware accelerated, DirectMusic also is software-emulated in Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff536250(v=vs.85).aspx Deciding Whether to Use the MIDI or DMus Port Driver]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, MIDI playback which is greatly sensitive to latency, timing and CPU usage can be choppy.
* Sounds cannot be played for balloon notifications any more. This is corrected in [[Windows 10]]
* Sounds do not play for Classic Start menu although sounds have been assigned to "Menu command" and "Menu popup" events in Sound control panel.
* Some [[Microsoft Speech API|SAPI]] 5.1 and SAPI 5.2 voices and applications do not work in Windows Vista and later. Only SAPI 5.3 compatible voices and applications work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942400/en-us An error message occurs when you try to run a Microsoft speech-based application in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The controls to adjust per speaker/per channel volume have been removed from the volume mixer.
* It is not possible to minimize the volume control window or change its size using Ctrl+S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/279709 How to Change the Size of the Volume Control Mixer Window]&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is no longer possible to double click the ''Volume'' icon in the notification area to show the volume mixer.
* The position of the volume mixer window is not saved.
* In [[Windows XP]], essentially, audio would be "broadcast" to all the audio endpoints at once. However, the new audio engine in Windows Vista changes this behaviour. Basically, audio can be sent only to the specific endpoint that the system has set by default, or which the user has configured via the ''[[Control panel (computer)|Control Panel]]'' setting. Although this new audio behavior provides separate [[Digital Signal Processing]] (DSP) capabilities, it is limiting in cases where audio has to be streamed to multiple devices such as headphones, speakers, HDMI out to AV receiver or analog audio to one device and digital to another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/thread/183405.aspx Output of analog and digital audio in Windows Vista and Media Center]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ability to customize the Windows startup sound has been removed, although the logon and logoff sounds can still be customized.
* [[Windows Media Center]] drops support for the [[Caller ID]] and [[Windows Messenger]] features.&lt;ref name="WinMsngr" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/d0110d17-369c-49ae-9e44-f18b52e400891033.mspx What happened to caller ID in Windows Media Center?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ''Sound'' Control Panel applet, the ability to preview a sound from the ''Browse'' dialog box has been removed.
* The option to enable or disable [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|digital CD audio]] is not available in the CD/DVD drive's properties in [[Device Manager]].
* The ability to change the recording device to mono mixer or stereo mixer has been removed.
* Several features have been eliminated from [[Sound Recorder (Windows)|Windows Sound Recorder]], such as the ability to import sounds, change the speed, add an echo, play in reverse mode, insertingfiles or mixing files.
* [[Sound Recorder (Windows)|Windows Sound Recorder]] no longer saves to wave (*.wav*) format anymore. Instead, it saves as Windows Media Audio (*.wma*) format. This is fixed in [[Windows 10]].

== Windows Media Player features ==
* The List Pane no longer allows deleting or editing items by right clicking items.
* Categories in the player library such as ''Music'', ''Pictures'', ''Videos'', ''Recorded TV'' show limited media information (metadata) columns, relevant only to their content type. In previous versions, all possible metadata columns were shown for all category types.
* Buttons to always show full-screen controls, show or hide the playlist while in full-screen mode and directly close Windows Media Player from full-screen have been removed.
* Auto sorting in the media library (similar to auto sorting in Windows Explorer) cannot be turned off.
* Grouping cannot be turned off. Library content is always grouped by the criteria by which it is sorted.
* The ability to add media to the library for searching local or network files and selectively adding only new files or existing files has been removed. Media can only be added from monitored folders.
* The seek slider cannot be always shown when playing media. The mouse must be hovered over the progress bar above the playback controls to reveal the seek slider.
* The sort order is not preserved in the library like Windows Media Player 10 as long as the player is open.
* The file list of selected files has been removed from the Advanced Tag Editor.
* ''Next'' and ''Previous'' buttons to cycle through visualizations have been removed.
* Most ''Auto Playlists'' included by default in Windows Media Player 10 have been removed.
* Library options to configure what action to take when double clicking files (Add to List, Play All, Play Selected Items) have been removed.
* The total playlist time is no longer shown in the Now Playing list or in the Library without selecting items. It is only shown in the Library for selected items.&lt;ref name="WMP11FAQ"&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/knowledgecenter/mediaadvice/0109.mspx#EAKAC Windows Media Player 11 FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Total number of tracks is also only shown after selecting all tracks. The total size in MB is not shown in any view.&lt;ref name="WMP11FAQ"/&gt;
* The expandable tree view was removed from the navigation pane/left side of the media library.
* The ''Quick Access Panel'', located next to the "Now Playing" tab in Windows Media Player 10 which enabled browsing the library via a pop-up/dropdown menu, has been removed. As an example of this, the library cannot be browsed through a menu and without having to switch to library view.
* It is not possible to change the media player's background to black. Instead, the background is a near-white shade of the color chosen in the color chooser.
* In previous versions of Windows Media Player, the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + I" could be used to capture the frame of video being displayed at the time the shortcut was initiated. This feature was removed for Windows Media Player 11.
* The ''License Management'' tool available in prior versions of Windows Media Player has been removed since version 11. It is not possible to back up and restore licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/faq/drm.mspx#q11_2 Windows Media DRM FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt; This prevents users of music download services from directly using Windows Media Player to back up their licenses and restore them to another computer. The user now must depend on the download service being able to assist with re-acquiring that license. Not all services support this so in some circumstances the user could lose the ability to play media which they've purchased for use with Windows Media Player 11. e.g. Walmart states: "Important Note: In many cases, we cannot replace song and license files if they are lost. We strongly suggest you back up your music by creating an audio CD or CDs using Windows Media Player 11"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://musicdownloads.walmart.com/catalog/servlet/HelpTopicServlet?topicIndex=0#5 |title=Walmart.com – Music Downloads |publisher=Walmart |year=January 2008 |accessdate=January 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/11/readme.aspx#1608319 |title=Backing up and restoring licenses |publisher=Microsoft |year=November 2006 |accessdate=January 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Windows Media Player 10, which is downloadable for Windows XP and part of [[Windows XP Media Center Edition|Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005]] includes the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer]] [[MP3]] [[Audio Compression Manager|ACM]] codec for ripping to MP3 format. Because of licensing restrictions, Windows Media Player 11 includes only an MP3 decoder, not an ACM encoder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/937141 You cannot use the Fraunhofer IIS MPEG Layer-3 codec to create MP3 content]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[HighMAT]] burning capability integrated into Windows Media Player 10 is not available in Windows Media Player 11.
* ''Display Anchor window when in skin mode'' option has been removed.
* ''Enable picture support for devices'' option has been removed.
* The ''Ambience'', ''Particle'', ''Plenoptic'', ''Spikes'', and ''Musical colors'' visualizations have been removed.
* The options to use the legacy renderer, overlay mixer, video mixing renderer (VMR-7) or high quality mode (VMR-9) are not available in the Windows Vista version of Windows Media Player 11. The Windows Vista version can use only the ''Enhanced Video Renderer'' (EVR).
* Support for live scrubbing or live seeking, that is, the ability to show the video frame after seeking with the mouse or after clicking with the mouse while paused is not available in the version of Windows Media Player 11 in Windows Vista and later but is supported in Windows Media Player 11 on Windows XP.
* The configuration tab to associate with media file types has also been removed from Windows Media Player 11 options in Windows Vista.
* On Windows Vista the ability to remove or reinstall Windows Media Player 11 is not present, as it is integrated with the operating system.
* Windows Media Player 6.4 (mplayer2.exe) has been removed like it was removed in [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]] 2005. The [[Media Control Interface|MCI]] version of [[Media Player (Microsoft)|Media Player]] (mplay32.exe) has also been removed.

== DirectX features ==
* Since Windows Vista features a rewritten audio stack and does not inherit the [[Hardware Abstraction Layer]] for audio that was present under prior versions of Windows, there is no hardware acceleration of ''[[DirectSound]]'' and ''[[DirectSound3D]]'' APIs. DirectSound and DirectMusic are emulated entirely in software. As a result, hardware accelerated audio and 3D spatialization in games utilizing ''[[DirectSound3D]]'' is no longer supported.
* [[Direct3D]] Retained Mode (D3DRM) has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490276.aspx Addressing Application Compatibility in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[DirectPlay]] Voice and [[DirectPlay|DirectPlay's]] [[Network Address Translation|NAT]] Helper have been removed.&lt;ref name="DXVista"&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee416788.aspx#WHAT_CHANGES_WERE_MADE_TO_THE_DIRECTX_RUNTIME_FOR_WINDOWS_VISTA__ DirectX Frequently Asked Questions (Windows)]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[DirectPlay]] has been deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb318767(VS.85).aspx DirectPlay deprecated]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[DirectMusic]] kernel mode synthesizer that supplies the DirectMusic components with a high-resolution timer has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943253 Timing jitter and clock drift when editing or playing MIDI in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Support for the DirectX 7 and DirectX 8 interfaces for [[Visual Basic]] 6.0 is not available on Windows Vista.&lt;ref name="DXVista"/&gt;

== Media features ==
* [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]] 2005 digital media components such as Windows Audio Converter, Windows Dancer, Windows CD Label Maker, Party Mode, Plus! screensavers and Windows Media Player skins and visualizations have been removed.
* Video content support is removed from [[Windows Image Acquisition]] for Windows Vista in favor of the newer ''Windows Portable Devices'' API.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/wpdblog/archive/2007/02/13/migrating-from-wia-to-wpd.aspx Migrating from WIA to WPD]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Windows Vista version of [[Windows Movie Maker]] or other analog video capture software which used WIA no longer supports importing, streaming or capturing analog video over USB or FireWire from such an analog video source as a [[Video Cassette Recorder|VCR]], an analog [[camcorder]] or from a [[Webcam|Web camera]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/1a1f1e2f-a62f-4e9a-967b-c074548924aa1033.mspx Windows Movie Maker no longer supports analog capture or webcam capture]&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Explorer also does not therefore display a webcam preview. Microsoft recommends using [[DirectShow]]-based software to capture or stream video from such sources.
* Legacy [[Video for Windows]] and [[Audio Compression Manager|ACM]] codecs (Indeo Video, Microsoft H.261, H.263, ACELP.net, [[G.723.1]]) are not included.
* The Device Manager no longer allows showing and configuring properties for [[Video for Windows|VCM]] and [[Audio Compression Manager|ACM]] codecs.
* The Windows Media source filter has been removed resulting in MMS: WMV files being unable to be streamed using [[GraphEdit]] or other DirectShow applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsdirectshowdevelopment/thread/4420bf19-71ce-4a00-9b3b-f441f8d61c63/ Windows Media Source Filter gone in Vista/Win7 – Alternatives?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsdirectshowdevelopment/thread/14533291-83e0-4a4b-baae-ab4aefaeda13 Issues building a streaming filtergraph for wmv in Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setup and servicing ==
* Windows Vista can no longer be installed on a volume with the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system, although reading and writing FAT data volumes is still supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/926069|title=Windows Vista can only be installed on an NTFS volume|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is not possible to install hotfixes/updates in unattended mode while displaying the progress bar. Updates can only be installed in silent unattended mode. The ''/passive'' switch is not supported.
* Because of setup design changes for faster installation, it is not possible to [[Slipstream (computing)|slipstream]] [[service pack]]s or [[hotfix]]es into the core operating system files as was possible with [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Server 2003]] and [[Windows 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/pages/windows-vista-service-pack-1-beta-whitepaper.aspx Windows Vista Service Pack 1 White Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902075248/http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/pages/windows-vista-service-pack-1-beta-whitepaper.aspx |date=2007-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft released an updated Windows Vista disc media that integrates [[Windows Vista Service Pack 1|Service Pack 1]]. However, the updated media is available only to certain enterprise customers, MSDN subscribers and new customers who buy the operating system after the release of SP1; it is not available to pre-SP1 end-users of Windows Vista. As an alternative, [[Windows Automated Installation Kit]] (WAIK) can be used to alter the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html|title=How to Create a Vista SP1 Slipstream Installation DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Because of setup design changes, it is not possible to perform an in-place repair reinstall of Windows Vista and later over an existing installation of Windows Vista or later. Any existing data is moved to Windows.old, Users.old folders and previously installed programs need to be reinstalled.
* Windows Vista uses ''Package Manager'' (''Pkgmgr.exe'') and ''Windows Update Standalone Installer'' (''Wusa.exe'') to install software updates and hotfixes. However, these do not support the various command-line switches like Windows XP's ''Package Installer'' (''Update.exe'') did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841 Command-line switches for Windows software update packages]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the functionality from ''Update.exe'' is missing. For example, there is no way to skip backing up uninstall information for hotfixes using the ''/nobackup'' or ''/n'' switch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2007/11/29/6608419.aspx#comments Update.exe switches and Package manager]&lt;/ref&gt; As Windows Vista performs no cleanup of operating system files in ''%Windir%\WinSxS'' for superseded updates, this folder's disk usage can increase considerably over time.
* There is no longer a progress bar shown for each individual downloaded update in the Windows Update UI. There is only a total progress bar. Windows Update also no longer shows a detailed progress of how many megabytes or kilobytes of the updates have been downloaded; it only shows a total size and a percentage of progress completion.

== File system, drivers, memory and hardware ==
* [[Windows Task Manager]] no longer shows the peak commit charge. It only shows current commit charge and the maximum limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russinovich|first1=Mark|title=Pushing the Limits of Windows: Virtual Memory|url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/markrussinovich/archive/2008/11/17/3155406.aspx|website=Mark Russinovich’s Blog|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=15 August 2014|date=17 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The driver-signing policy post installation is always set to ''Warn'', eliminating the ''Ignore'' and ''Block'' options that were available in Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa906314.aspx Driver Signatures and PnP Device Installation: Windows Driver Kit]&lt;/ref&gt;
* For [[Plug-and-play]] hardware which is plugged in after Windows Vista is installed, it is not possible to choose from a list of available staged or on-disk device drivers in the ''Found new hardware'' wizard which starts automatically. The ''Found new hardware'' wizard automatically searches for the driver and fails if it does not find a driver in the driver store or Windows Update. Only the ''Update Driver'' wizard which can be invoked from [[Device Manager]] then allows manually choosing a driver from a list.
* [[Windows Management Instrumentation]] Driver Extensions to [[Windows Driver Model|WDM]] are no longer supported.&lt;ref name="Deprecate"&gt;{{cite web

* Advanced settings for [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] mice such as ''sample rate'', ''input buffer length'' and ''fast initialization'' are not available in Mouse properties in [[Device Manager]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
* [[Offline Files]] (Client Side Caching) has been completely rewritten for Vista, dropping backward compatibility of registry configurability XP supported as described in [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811660 KB811660], dropping API support for various support tools such as CscCmd.exe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Features and functions in version 1.1 of the Client-Side Caching Command-Line Options command-line tool|date=2006-10-30|accessdate=2008-08-24|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/884739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CacheMov.exe&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942960 How to move the client-side caching (CSC) folder to a new location in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt; in the process. Furthermore, if the cache is encrypted (per the default setting), then multiple users of a machine can no longer make the same file available offline, as the cache is now encrypted by user-specific [[Encrypting File System|EFS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749610.aspx|title=Encrypting File System|date=2008-05-01|accessdate=2008-08-15|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Offline Files cannot be set to automatically synchronize at logoff. This was removed for performance reasons.
*Administrator-level access and a reboot are now required to point files pinned in the Offline Files cache to a new location following any change in the [[Uniform Naming Convention|UNC]] path to a network share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb309187(VS.85).aspx|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=2009-04-15|date=2009-04-02|title=RenameItem Method of the Win32_OfflineFilesCache Class}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* USB devices no longer turn off their indicator light after being safely removed with the icon from the notification area. The USB port to which a device is attached but safely removed still remains powered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971899 The Safely Remove Hardware feature does not stop power from being provided to a USB device in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boot, shutdown, power management ==
* The ''Low Battery Action'' cannot be set to run an external program any more.
* Although the ''Low Battery Alarm'' and ''Critical Battery Alarm'' sounds were updated in Windows Vista, the operating system's battery meter only displays an onscreen notification when a battery's energy reaches a low or critical level; the use of these sounds is reserved for third-party battery meter applications. Microsoft states that this is by design.&lt;ref&gt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950161/en-us&lt;/ref&gt;
* Detailed battery information, such as the battery name, unique ID number, chemistry type, and manufacturer information has been removed from Power Options.
* There is no longer a built-in graphical user interface to configure boot options. The command-line tool, ''BCDEdit.exe'' has to be used.
* The Startup Hardware Profiles feature in ''System Properties'' has been removed.
* Unlike previous versions of Windows, Windows Vista does not display a [[Progress bar|progress indicator]] during [[Hibernate (OS feature)|hibernation]]. Microsoft states that this is by design.&lt;ref&gt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/958103&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Vista does display a progress indicator after resuming from hibernation, but it is an ''indeterminate progress bar'' instead of a ''determinate progress bar'' used in previous versions of Windows.
* Although it is possible to customize the action Windows takes when the hardware ''Power'' button is pressed, it is no longer possible to set power options ''to ask the user every time'' what action to take upon pressing it. Therefore, selecting a different power action ''in each case'' is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlbeck.dk/PleaseAskMeWhatToDo.aspx "Ask me what to do" no longer a configurable option in each case when user presses power button]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Shutdown menu has been removed from [[Windows Task Manager]].
* The ''Shutdown.exe'' command line tool no longer displays a real-time countdown timer when the system is set to a timed shutdown or restart.
* The &lt;tt&gt;shutdown&lt;/tt&gt; command-line tool limits the delay option (&lt;tt&gt;-t&lt;/tt&gt;) to 600 seconds (10 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/securitytools/archive/2009/09/09/how-to-restart-a-remote-server-using-command-prompt.aspx] Blog post with a copy of the English documentation for the &lt;tt&gt;-t&lt;/tt&gt; option under Vista.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) service which monitors a UPS connected through a [[COM (hardware interface)|COM port]] is no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms789316.aspx Writing UPS Minidrivers: MSDN]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Windows applications and features ==
;[[System Restore]]
* System Restore no longer supports configuring its settings through the registry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bertk.mvps.org/html/q_a.html#6 Vista System Restore Q&amp;A – System Restore MVP Bert Kinney]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The GUI to configure the disk space utilized for System Restore points is not available in Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bertk.mvps.org/html/diskspacev.html Adjusting the amount of disk space System Restore uses to hold restore points: Bert Kinney – System Restore MVP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220133309/http://bertk.mvps.org/html/diskspacev.html |date=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* File types and directories can no longer be included or excluded from monitoring by System Restore by editing ''%windir%\system32\restore\Filelist.xml'' as was possible in Windows XP. This file no longer exists in Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa378870(v=vs.85).aspx System Restore: Monitored File Name Extensions]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Backup
* Unlike [[NTBackup]], it is not possible to include or exclude specific files or folders during a backup using the Windows Vista backup application.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.technet.com/b/filecab/archive/2006/11/06/file-backup-in-windows-vista-faq.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Only categories of file types can be archived. Because of this, it is not possible to backup files located in a specific path or a network location(s). 
* The backup application in Windows Vista does not support the use of [[tape drives]] to back up data.
* In the RTM release of Windows Vista, files encrypted using the [[Encrypting File System]] (EFS) were not archived by the operating system's backup application;&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/spatdsg/archive/2007/03/01/efs-and-vista-and-backup.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; this feature was reinstated in Service Pack 1.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.technet.com/b/filecab/archive/2008/03/10/what-s-new-with-backup-and-restore-on-vista-sp1.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
* Windows Vista Backup does not have all the features and command line parameters supported by [[NTBackup]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490952.aspx Ntbackup Command line Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; It also does not support the NTFS [[archive bit]] and granular restores.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

;Diagnostics and maintenance
* The [[Disk Cleanup]] handler to compress old files has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Under disk cleanup there is an option to compress old files |work=Microsoft Answers |publisher=Microsoft |date=2010-06-21 |url= http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-performance/disk-cleanup-compress-old-files/8ffe74e5-23c8-4787-ad91-0cc329bd2c0a |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=zusie2003 |author2=dax1792 |title=No option to compress old files in disk cleanup |work=Microsoft Answers |publisher=Microsoft |date=2010-12-28 |url= http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-performance/no-option-to-compress-old-files-in-disk-cleanup/8b04239d-e4f7-4383-ab2a-29d775645c5f |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The graphical representation and progress indicator of the defragmentation process or its analysis have been removed from [[Windows Disk Defragmenter]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.technet.com/b/filecab/archive/2006/07/10/disk-defragmenter-faq.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geekzone.co.nz/freitasm/529 Windows Vista Defrag: Dumbed-Down Interface]&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer possible to pause the defragmentation process. Moreover, in the RTM release of Windows Vista, it is not possible to select individual drives to defragment without using the ''defrag.exe'' command line utility; Service Pack 1 removes this limitation.&lt;ref&gt;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709618%28v=ws.10%29.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SP1Changes"&gt;* {{cite web |title = Notable Changes in Windows Vista Service Pack 1|work = Windows Vista Technical Library Roadmap|publisher = [[Microsoft TechNet]]|year = 2010|url = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709618%28v=ws.10%29.aspx|accessdate = 2012-12-27}}&lt;!--the document has a strange date notation in the form of 1268457258 - which is possibly a UNIX date of Sat, 13 Mar 2010 05:14:18 GMT--&gt;

* Disk Defragmenter no longer provides an analysis report with volume information such as the volume's [[file system]], storage capacity, remaining free space and percentage, cluster size, and number of contiguous files. However, this information can still be accessed from the ''defrag.exe'' command line utility.&lt;ref&gt;http://windowsitpro.com/article/utilities/defrag-from-windows-vista-s-command-line-98086&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.watchingthenet.com/get-detailed-statistics-by-running-windows-vista-disk-defragmenter-from-the-command-prompt.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Dr. Watson (debugger)|Dr. Watson]] application [[debugger]] and crash analysis tool has been removed. It is intended to be replaced by the [[Problem Reports and Solutions]] control panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/help/6c8431c2-8cac-4ff5-b210-4dceb3fd88331033.mspx/ What happened to Dr. Watson]&lt;/ref&gt; However, its functionality is different.
* The [[DirectX]] Diagnostic tool ([[DxDiag]]) only shows information; it is no longer possible to test the hardware and the various DirectX components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/al_msft/archive/2006/03/20/555065.aspx XNA Framework Goals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218095220/http://blogs.msdn.com/al_msft/archive/2006/03/20/555065.aspx |date=2008-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Certain command line switches for System Information (MSInfo32) are not supported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/300887 How to use System Information (MSINFO32) command-line tool switches]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Group Policy
* Several Group Policies that were applicable to various Windows XP components no longer apply to equivalent Windows Vista or later OS components due to design change. Therefore, a lot of customizability and functionality made possible by many Group Policies on XP is lost on Windows Vista and later.
* The Resultant Set of Policy snap-in no longer shows the full set of configured Group Policy settings. The command line tool, gpresult.exe has to be used to view all settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/winserverGP/thread/b15ac812-43c7-4091-8dca-3a6fe4a617cd Check if multiple GPO's are changing the same policy setting(s)]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Connectivity
* Because of Session 0 isolation, the console session has been removed from RDP server and corresponding /console switch removed from the RDP client.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947723 Changes to remote administration in Windows Server 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The following [[Microsoft Data Access Components|MDAC]]/Windows Data Access Components have been deprecated: [[16-bit]] [[Open Database Connectivity|ODBC]], [[Microsoft Jet Database Engine|Jet]] and Replication Objects (JRO), [[Remote Data Services]] (RDS), [[AppleTalk]] and [[Banyan Vines]] SQL Network Libraries, [[OLE DB|OLEDB]] Simple Provider (MSDAOSP), [[Open Database Connectivity|ODBC]] Setup, ODBC Cursor Engine and OLE DB Interface Remoting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=2008-07-25 |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms692882(VS.85).aspx |title=Windows DAC/MDAC Deprecated Components}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Windows Fax and Scan]]
* The Faxing components (Fax Console and Fax wizards) have been removed. Windows Fax and Scan is their replacement, however it is only included in Windows Vista Business, Enterprise and Ultimate editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/c54448ec-b3ec-4fab-ad6b-fe24abe5346b1033.mspx What happened to Fax Console?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unlike Windows XP Fax, [[Windows Fax and Scan]] in Windows Vista and later does not support the [[V.34bis]] standard which allows higher fax transfer speeds.&lt;ref name="WFS Limitations"&gt;[http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7hardware/thread/c2847de8-4045-4ebf-ae20-92e7ae40ae19 Fax &amp; Scan – V.34 compatibility and TWAIN] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130103192733/http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7hardware/thread/c2847de8-4045-4ebf-ae20-92e7ae40ae19 |date=2013-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Windows Fax and Scan does not support [[TWAIN]] scanners.&lt;ref name="WFS Limitations"/&gt; It only supports [[Windows Image Acquisition|WIA]] scanners.
* Windows Fax and Scan does not support copy/paste, drag and drop or import/export of previous faxes like Windows XP's Fax Console did.
* Windows Fax and Scan does not allow specifying the fax recipient's name if it is not added as a contact in [[Windows Contacts]].

;E-mail and contacts
* ''Block sender'' is not available in [[Windows Mail]] for newsgroups; it is only available for e-mail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vistax64.com/vista-mail/21190-no-block-sender-option-windows-mail-newsreader.html Vista – No "Block Sender" Option in Windows Mail Newsreader]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ability to send email as plain text (without [[HTML]]) only to a specific contact is not available in [[Windows Contacts]].
* It is not possible to share [[Microsoft Office Outlook]] contacts with [[Windows Contacts]], whereas in Windows XP, configuring the "''UseOutlook''" value in the registry allowed sharing Outlook contacts with the [[Windows Address Book]].

;Imaging
* The wizard for transferring photos from the camera had some of its functionality removed in [[Windows Photo Gallery]] such as the ability to choose which images to transfer from the camera; users had to copy all images even if they had been previously downloaded. However, the previous behavior with options to choose and automatically organize photos into folders is available in [[Windows Live Photo Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/pix/archive/2007/09/05/import.aspx Changes to Photo/Video Import in Live Photo Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226154822/http://blogs.msdn.com/pix/archive/2007/09/05/import.aspx |date=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, users can still manually copy specific images from the camera by exploring the connected camera from ''Windows Explorer''.
* Selective pages of multi-page [[TIFF]] files cannot be printed from [[Windows Photo Gallery]]; all pages are printed.
* [[TIFF]] annotations cannot be edited or created in [[Windows Photo Gallery]] or [[Windows Live Photo Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/john_daskalakis/archive/2009/03/26/9510689.aspx How Annotations in tiff images work, between different versions of Windows and Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024055822/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/john_daskalakis/archive/2009/03/26/9510689.aspx |date=2012-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Support for animated &lt;tt&gt;[[Graphics Interchange Format|.GIF]]&lt;/tt&gt; files has been removed in [[Windows Photo Gallery]] which replaced the [[Windows Picture and Fax Viewer]]. Only the first frame of the GIF animation is shown in Windows Photo Gallery. Animated GIF files display properly in [[Internet Explorer]]. Support for [[Windows Metafile|WMF]] and [[Windows Metafile|EMF]] formats has also been removed from [[Windows Photo Gallery]].

;[[Microsoft Agent]]
* Microsoft Agent character preview is not supported in the Agent Character file's property sheet.
* Microsoft Agent no longer supports multiple languages per edition of Windows. The Agent language will be the same as the language of the Windows edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms695905(v=vs.85).aspx Microsoft Agent Changes in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Due to Microsoft Agent using [[Microsoft Speech API|SAPI 5]] for Agent characters instead of SAPI 4, pitch and speed settings of the characters are broken/ignored unless new SAPI 5 compatible XML tags are used.

;Help and Support
* Help and Support content does not have an index.
* Help and Support no longer supports dual pane navigation.
* Favorites, History and advanced search options from the Windows XP Help and Support Center are not available in Windows Vista Help. It is not possible to share and install help content to and from other Windows computers or to install or switch to help for other operating systems.
* Built-in support for the 32-bit [[Microsoft WinHelp|&lt;tt&gt;.HLP&lt;/tt&gt; (WinHelp)]] help format has been removed&lt;ref name="winhlp32removed"&gt;{{cite web |title=WinHlp32.exe is no longer included in Windows Vista |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=2006-06-27 |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917607/ |accessdate=2006-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discourage software developers from using the obsolete format and encourage use of newer 32-bit help formats such as [[Microsoft Compiled HTML Help|Compiled HTML Help]]. When starting an application which uses the 32-bit &lt;tt&gt;.HLP&lt;/tt&gt; format, Windows will display a warning saying that the format is no longer supported. The viewer for viewing &lt;tt&gt;.HLP&lt;/tt&gt; files is available from the Microsoft Download Center, but some features present in previous versions are disabled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=6ebcfad9-d3f5-4365-8070-334cd175d4bb&amp;displaylang=en Download WinHelp Viewer for Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917607 WinHelp and Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt; Support for the 16-bit &lt;tt&gt;.HLP&lt;/tt&gt; format remains.
* [[Context-sensitive help]] is not available in Windows Vista, since it was dependent on [[Microsoft WinHelp|WinHelp]]. Although the [[Microsoft Compiled HTML Help|HTML Help]] technology also supports context-sensitive help (including "What's this" help), Windows Vista dialogs remove the "What's This" button and context sensitive and the "What's This" help functionality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.ni.com/public.nsf/allkb/3203A98657F7E8708625725F006EEABD Using What's This? Help on Windows Vista with Visual Basic 6.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Other features
* The ScriptPW.Password COM automation object to mask passwords from the command line is removed.
* [[Sound Recorder (Windows)|Sound Recorder]] in Windows Vista can no longer open audio files. Moreover, it cannot save in [[Lossless data compression|lossless]] (uncompressed) [[WAV]] format when run without using any [[Command line argument|switches]]; instead, it saves in [[lossy compression|lossy]] 96 kbit/s [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]] format.

== Networking ==
* The SMB 2 protocol unlike SMBv1 does not support determining if a file on a remote volume is a [[hard link]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html#remotecapabilities Link Shell Extension: Remote Capabilities]&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is no longer a notification area icon for Ethernet connections and quick access to enable/disable/repair them, or view their status and properties.
* Windows Vista no longer automatically creates shortcuts to previously visited network shares in the Network Explorer which replaces ''My Network Places''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/itprovistanetworking/thread/3668d553-3642-466a-822e-8acfa8066481 Where did the Shortcuts go from My Network Places?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistanetworking/thread/adbfa5fc-b568-4070-896b-1e5e3c6bec0d My Network Places in Vista?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is no balloon notification when a new connection is connected or when the wired or wireless adapters have limited or no connectivity.
* [[IPsec]] tunneling when the computer is behind an NAT device is no longer possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/944335/en-us The connection fails on a Windows Vista-based computer when you try to communicate with another computer through an IPsec tunnel-mode connection]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Wireless Provisioning Services'' feature to automatically configure [[wireless hotspot]]s by downloading XML files supplied by Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) is not supported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms806514.aspx About Wireless Provisioning Services: MSDN]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Audio (voice) sessions and sending invitations via ''mailto:'' are not supported in [[Windows Remote Assistance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Windows-Remote-Assistance-frequently-asked-questions Windows Remote Assistance: frequently asked questions]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1-click "Repair" function to perform a series of steps that quickly reset the network connection has been replaced by the ''Network Diagnostics'' feature which attempts to perform troubleshooting and offer suggestions.
* The [[WebDAV#Microsoft Windows|Web Folders]] client is not included by default in any version in favor of the WebDAV mini-redirector. It is not available for 64-bit versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/888123 You cannot connect to a Web folder from a Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP x64 computer]&lt;/ref&gt;
* UPnP [[Internet Gateway Device Protocol|IGD]] devices do not show up in ''Network Connections'' or in the notification area. Status information and statistics of the connection through the internet gateway is not available as could be viewed in Windows XP. NAT port mappings can be set up from the gateway device's ''Properties'' -&gt; Settings in ''Network Explorer''.
* The ''Network Setup Wizard'' and the ''Wireless Network Setup Wizard'' have been removed.
* Windows Vista uses the strong [[host model]] for networking, instead of the weak host model used by all previous Windows versions. A weak host model can accept locally destined unicast [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] from any network and transfer them to other interfaces on that network. In a [[multihoming|multihomed]] network setup, a strong host model can considerably limit connectivity although it improves security against multihome-based network attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2007/09/CableGuy/ Strong and Weak Host Models]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A single icon in the notification area (system tray) represents network connectivity through all network adapters and/or internet gateways, whether wired or wireless and for all different types of connections. It is not possible to set individual connection status icons on the taskbar or hide some or all network icons altogether.
* The ability to connect automatically to available non-preferred wireless networks in range and to [[wireless ad hoc network]]s has been removed due to security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/peertopeer/thread/975cf9c1-7bbf-445c-9122-0bc0ee0b2822/ Utility to provide automatic ad hoc wireless network connections in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wddiary.wikidot.com/other-notes How to connect to adhoc network automatically in Vista?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.karthikeyan.co.in/posts/auto-connect-wireless-adhoc-networks-in-windows-vista/ Auto connect wireless ad hoc networks in Windows Vista] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226182814/http://blog.karthikeyan.co.in/posts/auto-connect-wireless-adhoc-networks-in-windows-vista/ |date=2009-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also not possible to save the network profile of an ad hoc wireless connection if the connection has been created/initiated by another computer.
* Changing the ''KeepRasConnections'' registry key to remain connected after logging off from a RAS client is not supported in Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/158909/ How to keep RAS connections active after logging off in Windows versions prior to Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Direct cable connection]] feature is not supported in Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930086/en-us Direct incoming connections over serial, infrared or parallel ports are not supported in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unlike [[Outlook Express]], [[Windows Mail]] does not have support for [[HTTP]] mail via the [[WebDAV]] protocol (used by older [[Hotmail]] accounts and [[Yahoo! Mail]]); [[Windows Live Mail]] however supports [[WebDAV]].
* Unlike Outlook Express, Windows Mail does not allow users to switch ''Identities'' or manage multiple identities within one running instance of the program. Instead, identities are now tied to the ''user account'' and to create additional users or identities, a new ''user account'' has to be created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/98c039d9-78d1-41c7-8ece-b505780d68701033.mspx E-mail identities in Windows Mail]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) and [[POP3]] servers have been removed from the IIS component in Windows Vista.&lt;ref name="Deprecate" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070110224245/http://weblogs.asp.net/steveschofield/archive/2006/12/19/iis7-post-23-vista-and-smtp-server-where-is-it.aspx IIS7 Vista and SMTP server. Where is it?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* rexec, [[Remote Shell|rsh]], [[Finger protocol|finger]], and some other command-line tools primarily used to communicate with [[UNIX]]-based systems have been removed from the default installation. The Subsystem for Unix-based applications (SUA) (previously known as [[Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX|Windows Services for Unix]]) still provides them as an optional component.
* [[Windows Messenger]] has been removed in favor of a link to [[Windows Live Messenger]]. Windows Messenger support has also been dropped from [[Windows Media Center]].&lt;ref name="WinMsngr"&gt;[http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/ee71263b-9430-49e5-9cee-20ba55f464941033.mspx What happened to Messenger in Windows Media Center?]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Support for built-in [[H.323]] Voice Over IP ([[VOIP]]) capabilities has been removed. [[Microsoft NetMeeting|NetMeeting]], H.323 and IP Multicast Conference [[Telephony Service Provider|TSPs]] and [[Media service provider|MSPs]], and [[HyperACCESS|HyperTerminal]] all are no longer included. [[Windows Meeting Space]] is the replacement for NetMeeting; however, features like microphone support, and ability to set up audio or video conferences, are now removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/netmeeting Migrating from NetMeeting]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Call answering, connecting to an internet directory, video call and H.323/conference call features have been removed from Phone Dialer.

* [[NetDDE]], a technology that allows applications using the [[Dynamic data exchange|DDE]] transport to transparently exchange data over a network, is no longer supported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/nickkramer/archive/2006/04/18/577962.aspx NetDDE is not present in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows Chat]] (WinChat) which used NetDDE has also been removed.

;Legacy networking components
* The [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]] is no longer supported.
* The [[Windows Messenger service]] and the [[Alerter service]] are no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370242(VS.85).aspx Alert functions (Windows): MSDN]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rarely used protocols such as [[Bandwidth Allocation Protocol]] and [[X.25]] support for [[Serial Line Internet Protocol|SLIP]] have been removed. SLIP connections are automatically upgraded to use [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP]].
* The SPAP, EAP-MD5-CHAP, and [[MS-CHAP|MS-CHAP v1]] protocols are no longer supported for PPP-based connections, in favor of MS-CHAP v2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.activewin.com/reviews/previews/vistarc1tech/#Sidebar MS-CHAPv1 support dropped]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[NWLink]] [[IPX/SPX]]/[[NetBIOS]] Compatible Transport Protocol is no longer supported.

* ACPI 2.0 or later is preferred, as Windows Vista's support of technologies like AMD's Cool'n'Quiet power-saving technology is disabled on ACPI 1.0 enabled motherboards.
* Other "legacy" hardware technologies no longer supported include: [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]] buses, [[game port]]s, [[MPU-401]], [[AMD K6|AMD K6/2+]] Mobile Processors, Mobile [[Pentium II]] and Mobile [[Pentium III]] SpeedStep, and COM-port based UPSes; ISAPnP&lt;ref name="isapnp"&gt;See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810030.aspx Microsoft Windows and the Plug and Play Framework Architecture] for a discussion on ISA PnP technology.&lt;/ref&gt; is disabled by default.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7644">In [[environmental law]] and [[Environmental policy|policy]], '''market-based instruments''' ('''MBIs''') are [[policy]] instruments that use [[Market (economics)|market]]s, [[price]], and other [[Economy|economic]] variables to provide [[Economic incentive|incentives]] for polluters to reduce or eliminate negative environmental [[Externality|externalities]]. MBIs seek to address the [[market failure]] of externalities (such as [[pollution]]) by incorporating the external cost of production or consumption activities through taxes or charges on processes or products, or by creating property rights and facilitating the establishment of a proxy market for the use of environmental services. Market-based instruments are also referred to as '''economic instruments''', '''price-based instruments''', '''new environmental policy instruments''' ('''NEPIs''')  or ''''new instruments of environmental policy'''. 

Examples include environmentally related [[tax]]es, charges and [[Subsidy|subsidies]], [[emissions trading]] and other tradeable permit systems, [[deposit-refund system]]s, environmental labeling laws, licenses, and [[property rights (economics)|economic property rights]]. For instance, the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] is an example of a market-based instrument to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

Market-based instruments differ from other policy instruments such as voluntary agreements (actors voluntarily agree to take action) and [[Regulation|regulatory]] instruments (sometimes called "command-and-control"; public authorities mandate the performance to be achieved or the technologies to be used). However, implementing an MBI also commonly requires some form of regulation. Market based instruments can be implemented in a systematic manner, across an economy or region, across economic sectors, or by environmental medium (e.g. water).  Individual MBIs are instances of [[environmental pricing reform]].

According to Kete (2002), "policymaking appears to be in transition towards more market-oriented instruments, but it remains an open-ended experiment whether we shall successfully execute a long-term s''ocial'' transition that involves the private sector and the state in new relationships implied by the pollution prevention and economic instruments rhetoric."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Kete, "Environmental policy instruments for market and mixed-market economies" (January 1994). ''Utilities Policy'', Vol. 4, 1: pp. 5-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
For example, although the use of new environmental policy instruments only grew significantly in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the 1990s, [[David Lloyd George]] may have introduced the first market-based instrument of environmental policy in the UK when a [[Fuel tax]] was levied in 1909 during his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, A., Wurzel, R., Zito, R., and Bruckner, L. (2003). Policy innovation or 'muddling through'? 'New' environmental policy instruments in the United Kingdom. ''Environmental Politics'', 12 (1). pp. 179-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

A market-based transferable permit sets a maximum level of pollution (a 'cap'), but is likely to achieve that level at a lower cost than other means, and, importantly, may reduce below that level due to technological innovation.

When using a transferable-permit system, it is very important to accurately measure the initial problem and also how it changes over time. This is because it can be expensive to make adjustments (either in terms of compensation or through undermining the property rights of the permits). Permits' effectiveness can also be affected by things like market [[liquidity]], the quality of the property right, and existing [[market power]].&lt;ref name=Guerin&gt;Guerin, K. (2003). ''Property Rights and Environmental Policy: A New Zealand Perspective.''Wellington, New Zealand: NZ Treasury&lt;/ref&gt; Another important aspect of transferable permits is whether they are auctioned or allocated via [[grandfathering]].

An argument against permits is that formalising emission rights is effectively giving people a license to pollute, which is believed to be socially unacceptable. However, although valuing adverse environmental impacts may be controversial, the acceptable cost of preventing these impacts is implicit in all regulatory decisions.&lt;ref name=Guerin/&gt;

==Taxes==

A market-based tax approach determines a maximum cost for control measures. This gives polluters an incentive to reduce pollution at a lower cost than the tax rate. There is no cap; the quantity of pollution reduced depends on the chosen tax rate.

A [[tax]] approach is more flexible than permits, as the [[tax rate]] can be adjusted until it creates the most effective incentive. Taxes also have lower [[compliance costs]] than permits. However, taxes are less effective at achieving reductions in target quantities than permits. Using a tax potentially enables a [[double dividend]], by using the revenue generated by the tax to reduce other distortionary taxes through [[revenue recycling]].&lt;ref name=Guerin/&gt; There can also be conflict between objectives with a tax: less pollution means less revenue.

==Market-based vs command and control==

An alternate approach to environmental regulation is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control_regulation#Environmental_regulation| command and control approach]. This is much more prescriptive than market-based instruments. Command and control regulatory instruments include emissions standards, process/equipment specifications, limits on input/output/discharges, requirements to disclose information, and audits. Command and control approaches have been criticised for restricting technology, as there is no incentive for firms to innovate.&lt;ref name=Guerin/&gt;

Market-based instruments do not prescribe that firms use specific technologies, or that all firms reduce their emissions by the same amount, which allows firms greater flexibility in their approaches to pollution management. However, command and control approaches may be beneficial as a starting point, when regulators are faced with a significant problem yet have too little information to support a market-based instrument. Command and control approaches can also be preferred when regulators are faced with a [[thin market]], where the limited potential trading pools mean the gains of a market-based instrument would not exceed the costs (a key requirement for a successful market-based approach).&lt;ref name=Guerin/&gt;

Market-based instruments may also be inappropriate in dealing with emissions with local impacts, as trading would be restricted to within that region. They may also be inappropriate for emissions with global impacts, as international cooperation may be difficult to attain.

For a variety of reasons, environmental advocates initially opposed the use of market-based instruments except under very constrained conditions.  However, after the successful use of freely traded credits in the lead phasedown in the U.S. environmental advocates recognized that trading markets has benefits for the environment as well.&lt;ref&gt;•Alan P. Loeb, "Addressing the Public's Goals for Environmental Regulation When Communicating Acid Rain Allowance Trades," The Electricity Journal, May 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, beginning with the proposal of the acid rain allowance market, environmental advocates have supported the use of trading in a variety of contexts.

'''Mount Roraima''' ({{lang-pt|Monte Roraima}} {{IPA-pt|ˈmõtʃi ʁoˈɾajmɐ|}}, ''Tepuy Roraima'' and ''Cerro Roraima'';) is the highest of the [[Pakaraima]] chain of [[tepui]] [[plateau]]s in [[South America]].{{R|"Swan1"|page1=156}} First described by the English explorer [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] during [[Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition|his 1595 expedition]], its {{convert|12|mi2|km2|adj=mid|abbr=off|order=flip}} summit area{{R|"Swan1"|page1=156}} is bounded on all sides by cliffs rising {{convert|400|m|ft}}. The mountain also serves as the [[tripoint]] of [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]] and [[Brazil]].{{R|"Swan1"|page1=156}}

Mount Roraima lies on the [[Guiana Shield]] in the southeastern corner of Venezuela's {{convert|30000|km2|sqmi|abbr=off|adj=on}} [[Canaima National Park]] forming the highest peak of Guyana's Highland Range. 

The highest point in Guyana&lt;ref name="Peakbagger2" /&gt; and the highest point of the Brazilian state of [[Roraima]]&lt;ref name="Peakbagger3" /&gt; lie on the plateau, but Venezuela and Brazil have higher mountains elsewhere. The [[tripoint|triple border point]] is at {{coord|5|12|08|N|60|44|07|W}},&lt;ref name="Peakbagger3" /&gt; but the mountain's highest point is Laberintos del Norte.
==Flora and fauna==
[[File:Tepuy vegetation - Roraima Venezuela.JPG|thumb|left|Vegetation on Mount Roraima]]
Many of the species found on Roraima are unique to the tepui plateaus with two local endemic plants found on Roraima summit. Plants such as [[pitcher plant]]s (''[[Heliamphora]]''), ''[[Campanula]]'' (a bellflower), and the rare ''[[Rapatea]]'' heather are commonly found on the escarpment and summit.{{R|"Swan1"|page1=156–157}} It rains almost every day of the year. Almost the entire surface of the summit is bare [[sandstone]], with only a few bushes (''[[Bonnetia|Bonnetia roraimœ]]'') and [[algae]] present.{{R|"ImThurn1"|page1=517|"Clementi1"|page2=464|"Tate1"|page3=63}} Low scanty and bristling vegetation is also found in the small, sandy marshes that intersperse the rocky summit.{{R|"ImThurn1"|page1=517}} Most of the [[nutrient]]s that are present in the soil are washed away by torrents that cascade over the edge, forming some of the highest waterfalls in the world.

[[File:Utricularia campbelliana.JPG|thumb|''[[Utricularia campbelliana]]'' from Mount Roraima]]
There are multiple examples of unique fauna atop Mount Roraima. ''[[Oreophrynella quelchii]]'', commonly called the Roraima Bush Toad, is a [[Diurnality|diurnal]] toad usually found on open rock surfaces and shrubland. It is a species of toad in the family [[Bufonidae]] and breeds by [[direct development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoogmoed|first=Marinus|title=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org|work=Oreophrynella quelchii.|publisher=IUCN 2012|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species is currently listed as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] and there is a need for increased education among tourists to make them aware of the importance of not handling these animals in the wild. Close population monitoring is also required, particularly since this species is known only from a single location. The species is protected in [[Monumento Natural Los Tepuyes]] in Venezuela, and [[Parque Nacional Monte Roraima]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geographical|title=A Lost World Above the Clouds|url=http://www.geographical.co.uk|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Since long before the arrival of European explorers, the mountain has held a special significance for the indigenous people of the region, and it is central to many of their myths and legends. The [[Pemon]] and Kapon natives of the [[La Gran Sabana|Gran Sabana]] see Mount Roraima as the stump of a mighty tree that once held all the fruits and tuberous vegetables in the world. Felled by Makunaima, their mythical trickster, the tree crashed to the ground, unleashing a terrible flood.{{R|"Stela1"}} ''Roroi'' in the Pemon language means blue-green and ''ma'' means great.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}} It is also said to have inspired Paradise Falls from the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://myturntotravel.com/mount-roraima-hike/|title=Mount Roraima Hike: Up On Top Venezuela’s Lost World {{!}} My Turn To Travel|date=2018-01-03|work=My Turn To Travel|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science4grownups.com/archives/2009/05/29/general/the-real-world-behind-ups-paradise-falls-530|title=The real world behind “Up’s” Paradise Falls|website=science4grownups.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the steep sides of the plateau make it difficult to access, it was the first recorded major [[tepui]] to be climbed: Sir [[Everard im Thurn]] walked up a forested ramp in December 1884 to scale the plateau. This is the same route hikers take today. A report by the noted South American researcher [[Robert Schomburgk]] inspired the Scottish author [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to write his novel [[The_Lost_World_(Conan_Doyle_novel)|The Lost World]] about the discovery of a living prehistoric world full of dinosaurs and other primordial creatures.

The only non-technical route to the top is the Paraitepui route from Venezuela; any other approach will involve climbing gear. Mount Roraima has been climbed on a few occasions from the Guyana and Brazil sides, but as the mountain is entirely bordered on both these sides by enormous sheer cliffs that include high overhanging (negative-inclination) stretches, these are extremely difficult and technical [[rock climbing]] routes.  Such climbs would also require difficult authorizations for entering restricted-access national parks in the respective countries.

In Brazil the [[Monte Roraima National Park]] lies within the [[Raposa Serra do Sol]] Indigenous Territory, and is not open to the public without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|Unidade de Conservação ... MMA}}|language=Portuguese |title=Unidade de Conservação: Parque Nacional do Monte Roraima|publisher=MMA: Ministério do Meio Ambiente |url=http://sistemas.mma.gov.br/cnuc/index.php?ido=relatorioparametrizado.exibeRelatorio&amp;relatorioPadrao=true&amp;idUc=174|accessdate=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 Austrian [[documentary]] ''Jäger des Augenblicks - Ein Abenteuer am Mount Roraima (Moment Hunters - An Adventure on Mount Roraima)'' shows rock climbers Kurt Albert, Holger Heuber, and [[Stefan Glowacz]] climbing to the top of Mount Roraima from the Guyana side. Similarly, in 2010 Brazilian climbers Eliseu Frechou, Fernando Leal and Márcio Bruno opened a new route on the Guyanese side, climbing to the top in 12 days of a very difficult vertical wall climb.&lt;ref name="frechou1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Frechou |first=Eliseu |url=http://www.extremos.com.br/noticias/100124-Eliseu-Frechou-e-equipe-escalam-o-monte-roraima.asp |title=Eliseu Frechou e equipe chegam ao cume do Monte Roraima |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Eliseu Frechou and his team reach the top of Mount Roraima |work=Extremos - Portal de Aventura |date=2010-01-24 |accessdate=2016-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They called the new route ''Guerra de Luz e Trevas'' (Portuguese for "War of Light and Darkness") and classed it as 6° VIIa A3 J4. A 28-minute Vimeo video called [https://vimeo.com/15300288 ''Dias de Tempestade (Days of Storm)''] is available documenting their climb (English subtitles, audio in Portuguese).

[[File:Pentaprism.svg|thumb|A pentaprism.]]
The '''optical square''' uses a [[pentaprism]] to reflect and refract a beam or sighting 90 degrees, it is used in pairs in surveying and in a singular block in metrology.

==Metrology==
Used with an [[autocollimator]] or [[angle dekkor]] and mirror it can be used for machine tool axis squareness checking.
For measuring the squareness of surfaces. It has two mirrors with 45 degree to each other. One is half silvered called horizon glass and other is full silvered called index glass.It measures angel by reflection. Two [[prism]]s can be used as an optical square.

==Optical square in surveying==
[[Image:Doppelpenta.jpg|thumb|upright|Double pentaprism as used in surveying.]]
In [[surveying]] it is used both as a hand held tool for sighting between two poles (often with a [[plumb bob]] hung from the handle) and also mounted on a [[Jacob's staff]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the State of Palestine:

[[State of Palestine|Palestine]] is politically under the jurisdiction of the [[Palestinian government]] and the [[Hamas Government in Gaza]]. Since the [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]] in 1988 and the consequent admission into UN as an observer state in 2012, Palestine is today recognized by three-quarters of the world's countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/full-transcript-of-abbas-speech-at-un-general-assembly-1.386385] "Note that the term [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] has historically referred to the region which today incorporates [[Israel]] as well as the Palestinian territories. The current position was expressed by [[Mahmoud Abbas]] in his September 2011 speech to the United Nations: 'When we adopted this program, we were taking a painful and very difficult step for all of us, especially those, including myself, who were forced to leave their homes and their towns and villages, carrying only some of our belongings and our grief and our memories and the keys of our homes to the camps of exile and the Diaspora in the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|1948 Al-Nakba]], one of the worst operations of uprooting, destruction and removal of a vibrant and cohesive society that had been contributing in a pioneering and leading way in the cultural, educational and economic renaissance of the Arab Middle East. Yet, because we believe in peace and because of our conviction in international legitimacy, and because we had the courage to make difficult decisions for our people, and in the absence of absolute justice, we decided to adopt the path of relative justice&amp;nbsp;– justice that is possible and could correct part of the grave historical injustice committed against our people. Thus, we agreed to establish the State of Palestine on only 22% of the territory of historical Palestine&amp;nbsp;– on all the Palestinian Territory occupied by Israel in 1967.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Although recently promoted to a non-member state status in the UN, the State of Palestine is not recognized by [[Israel]] and some major [[Western world|Western nations]], including much of the [[European Union]] as well as [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], the [[United States]], and [[Mexico]] (For a full list, see [[International recognition of the State of Palestine]]).

'''''Outremer''''' ({{lang-fr|outre-mer}}, meaning "overseas") was a general name used for the [[Crusader states]]; it originated after victories of Europeans in the [[First Crusade]] and was applied to the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], the [[County of Tripoli]], and especially the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. During the [[Renaissance]], the term was later often equated to the area of the [[Levant]] and it remains synonymous for the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name="Johnson1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Paul|title=Civilizations of the Holy Land|accessdate=25 December 2017|year=1979|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|language=English |page=202|quote=Of the enormous literature which the crusades inspired in Europe, only one poem of any importance was actually written in the Holy Land, or Outremer as the Latins called it: the so-called Chanson des Chetifs, produced at Antioch a little before 1149.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] originated before the Crusades, but it was granted the status of a kingdom by [[Pope Celestine III]]. It later became fully westernised by the French [[House of Lusignan]].

In general, the French used this term to refer to any land "overseas". For example, King [[Louis IV of France]] was called "Louis d'Outremer", as he was raised in [[England]]. 

In the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'', "Outremer" is used as the name of a fictional Muslim country. It is identified as one of the many countries participating in the general mobilization of the [[Muslim world]] against Christianity at the climax of the plot.

== Present-day use ==
The modern term ''outre-mer'', spelled with a hyphen and equally meaning "overseas," is used by the French government for the [[overseas departments and territories of France]] (in [[French language|French]]: ''Départements d'outre-mer – Territoires d'outre-mer'' or ''DOM–TOM'', collectively ''Pays et territoires d'outre-mer'' (PTOM)). It is also the name of a French catamaran manufacturer based in [[La Grande-Motte]].

== Literature ==
* In ''[[Monsieur (novel)|Monsieur]], or The Prince of Darkness'' (1974), [[Lawrence Durrell]]'s first novel of ''[[The Avignon Quintet]]'', the first section is entitled "Outremer" and is set in Provence.
* [[David Nicolle]]: ''Knight of Outremer 1187–1344 AD'', Warrior No. 18. Osprey Publishing, Oxford 2003. {{ISBN|1-85532-555-1}}.

In "Lionheart", the protagonists are introduced sailing to Outremer. The novel revolves around Richard the Lionheart's Crusades in the Holy Land.

'''Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser''', sometimes '''Petrus Theodorus''' (c. 1540 in [[Emden]] &amp;ndash; 11 September 1596 in [[Banten]]), was a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] navigator who mapped the [[southern hemisphere|southern sky]].

==Voyages and star observation==
Little is known of Keyser's life outside of his astronomical observations and East Indies voyages.&lt;ref name=knobel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knobel|first=E. B.|title=On Frederick de Houtman's catalogue of southern stars, and the origin of the southern constellations|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=March 1917|volume=77|pages=414–432|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1917MNRAS..77..414K/0000414.000.html|accessdate=12 July 2012|bibcode = 1917MNRAS..77..414K|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.5.414}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several trips, {{citation needed span|text=one to [[Brazil]], and one to [[Novaya Zemlya|Nova Zembla]]|date=November 2012}} Keyser participated as the chief navigator and head of the steersmen for the first Dutch voyage to the [[East Indies]] (the "Eerste Schipvaart"), which left [[Texel]] with four ships on 2 April 1595  under [[Cornelis de Houtman]]. He had been trained by cartographer [[Petrus Plancius]] in mathematics and astronomy. Plancius, a key promoter to the Dutch East Indies expeditions, had instructed Keyser to map the skies in the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]], which were largely uncharted at the time.&lt;ref name=knobel /&gt;&lt;ref name=startales&gt;{{cite book|last=Ridpath|first=Ian|title=Star Tales|date=1988|publisher=Lutterworth|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0718826956|page=9|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fleet finally was able to obtain fresh supplies at [[Madagascar]] on 13 September, 71 of the 248 sailors had died, most of [[scurvy]]. The surviving crew stayed for several months on the island, to recover and make repairs, at which point Keyser probably made most of his celestial observations. He was aided in this by [[Frederick de Houtman]] and Vechter Willemsz. After leaving Madagascar, it took another four months (February to June 1596) for the ships to reach [[Sumatra]] and finally [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] on [[Java]]. Trade negotiations went sour, perhaps caused by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] instigators, perhaps by inexperience, and the crew was forced to find drinking water and other supplies on Sumatra across the [[Sunda Strait]]. Keyser apparently died during this crossing. On 14 August 1597, 81 survivors made it back to Texel, including de Houtman, who probably delivered Keyser's observations to Plancius.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Constellations==
From the observations of the expedition, Plancius created a celestial globe in late 1597, published by [[Jodocus Hondius]], showing twelve new constellations of the southern sky that have become accepted among the [[88 modern constellations|standard constellations]] codified by modern astronomers. The majority were named after various animals that 16th century explorers had encountered (e.g. Bird of Paradise, Chameleon, Toucan, Flying Fish). [[Willem Janszoon Blaeu]] copied these constellations on a 1602 globe and created a new globe in 1603 incorporating further observations made by de Houtman on a second voyage to the East Indies. [[Johann Bayer]] included these new southern constellations in his influential 1603 star atlas ''[[Uranometria]]'', crediting them to "Petrus Theodori" (Pieter Keyser),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kanas |first=Nick |date=2009 |title=Star Maps: History, Artistry, and Cartography |edition=2nd |publisher=Springer |page=119 |isbn=978-1-4614-0916-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not acknowledging their earlier publication. Bayer is therefore often mistakenly credited for introducing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johann Bayer's Southern Star Chart|last=Ridpath|first=Ian|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keyser is commemorated by [[minor planet]] (10655) Pietkeyser.&lt;ref name=JPL&gt;{{cite web|title=10655 Pietkeyser (9535 P-L)|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=10655|work=Solar System Dynamics|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Republic of Pirates''' is the [[nomenclature]] for the [[Headquarters|base]] or [[Fortification|stronghold]] of a loose [[wikt:confederacy|confederacy]] run by [[privateer]]s-turned-[[Piracy|pirate]]s in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] on [[New Providence]] island in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] for about eleven years from 1706 until 1718. Although not a state or republic in a formal sense, it was governed by its own informal '[[Pirate code|Code of Conduct]]'. The activities of the pirates caused havoc with trade and shipping in the [[West Indies]], until governor [[Woodes Rogers]] reached Nassau in 1718 and restored the British control.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
{{See also|Piracy in the Caribbean}}
The era of piracy in the Bahamas began in 1696, when the privateer [[Henry Every]] brought his ship the ''[[Fancy (ship)|Fancy]]'' loaded with loot from plundering Indian trade ships into Nassau harbour. Every bribed the governor [[Nicholas Trott]] with gold and silver, and with the ''Fancy'' itself, still loaded with 50 tons of elephant tusks and 100 barrels of gunpowder. This established Nassau as a base where pirates could operate safely, although various governors regularly made a show of suppressing piracy. Although the [[List of governors of the Bahamas|governors]] were still legally in charge, the pirates became increasingly powerful.

The era of true pirate control occurred when a combined [[French Navy|Franco]]-[[Spanish Navy|Spanish Fleet]] [[Raid on Nassau|attacked Nassau]] in 1703 and again in 1706; the island was effectively abandoned by many of its settlers and left without any English government presence. Nassau was then taken over by English privateers, who became completely [[Lawlessness|lawless]] pirates over time. The pirates attacked French and Spanish ships, while the French and Spanish forces burned Nassau several more times. Pirates established themselves in Nassau, and essentially established their own republic with its own governors. By 1713 the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was over, but many British privateers were slow to get the news, or reluctant to accept it, and so slipped into piracy. This led to large numbers of unemployed privateers making their way to New Providence to join the republic and swell its numbers. The republic was dominated by two famous pirates who were bitter rivals – [[Benjamin Hornigold]] and [[Henry Jennings]]. Hornigold was mentor to pirates such as the famous [[Blackbeard|Edward Teach]], known as "Blackbeard", along with [[Sam Bellamy]] and [[Stede Bonnet]]. Jennings was mentor to [[Charles Vane]], [[Calico Jack|'Calico' Jack Rackham]], [[Anne Bonny]], and [[Mary Read]]. Despite their rivalries, the pirates formed themselves into the '[[Flying Gang]]' and quickly became infamous for their exploits. The [[Governor of Bermuda]] stated that there were over 1000 pirates in Nassau at that time and that they outnumbered the mere hundred of inhabitants in the town. Blackbeard was later voted by the pirates of Nassau to be their [[Magistrate]], to be in command of their republic and enforce [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] as he saw fit.

Pirate [[Thomas Barrow (pirate)|Thomas Barrow]] declared “that he is Governor of Providence and will make it a second [[Madagascar]], and expects 5 or 600 men more from Jamaica sloops to join in the settling of Providence, and to make war on the French and Spaniards, but for the English, they don't intend to meddle with them, unless they are first attack'd by them.”&lt;ref name="CSP-VOL29"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Headlam|first1=Cecil|title=America and West Indies: July 1716 {{!}} British History Online|date=1930|publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office|location=London|pages=139-159|edition=Vol 29|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/colonial/america-west-indies/vol29/pp139-159|accessdate=15 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While originally the pirates had avoided attacking British ships, this restraint disappeared over time, and at their height, the pirates could command a small fleet of ships that could take on the [[frigate]]s of the [[Royal Navy]]. The amount of havoc caused by the pirates led to an outcry for their destruction, and finally [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] appointed [[Woodes Rogers]] as Governor of the Bahamas to bring the piracy to an end.{{sfn|Woodard|2007|p=166}}{{sfn|Woodard|2007|p=167}}{{sfn|Woodard|2007|p=168}}{{sfn|Woodard|2007|p=262-314}} In 1718 Rogers arrived in Nassau with a fleet of seven ships, carrying a pardon for all those who turned themselves in and refrained from further piracy. Among those who accepted this offer was Benjamin Hornigold, and, in a shrewd move, Rogers commissioned Hornigold to hunt down and capture those pirates who refused to surrender and accept the [[Royal prerogative of mercy|royal pardon]]. As a former privateer himself, Hornigold was well placed to understand what needed to be done and he pursued his former comrades with zeal. Although pirates such as Charles Vane and Blackbeard evaded capture, Hornigold did take ten pirates prisoner and on the morning of 12 December 1718, nine of them were executed. This act re-established [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British control]] and ended the pirates' republic in the Bahamas. Those pirates who had fled successfully continued their piratical activities elsewhere in the Caribbean in what has become known as the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].

==Code of conduct==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
{{Main|Pirate code}}
The pirates ran their affairs using what was called the [[pirate code]], which was the basis of their claim that their rule of New Providence constituted a kind of 'republic'. According to the code, the pirates ran their ships [[Democracy|democratically]], sharing plunder equally and [[Direct democracy|selecting and deposing]] their [[Captain (naval)|captain]]s by [[Direct election|popular vote]]. Many of the pirates were privateers out of work since the end of the [[Queen Anne's War]] and ex-sailors who had revolted against the conditions on [[Merchant navy|merchant]] and [[Navy|naval ships]], and [[African people|African]]s with many [[Irishmen]] could be equal members of the crew – several [[mulatto]]s became pirate captains. Some of the pirates were also [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]]s, who had become pirates to help restore the recently deposed [[House of Stuart|Stuart line]] to the throne.

The '''silver age of alpinism''' is the name given in Great Britain to the era in [[mountaineering]] that began after [[Edward Whymper]] and party's ascent of the [[Matterhorn]] in 1865 and ended with [[William Woodman Graham|W. W. Graham]] and party's ascent of the [[Dent du Géant]] in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geographical.co.uk/Features/Alpine_club_Dec_07.html Alpine history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521040305/http://www.geographical.co.uk/Features/Alpine_club_Dec_07.html |date=21 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the [[golden age of alpinism]] (1854–1865) was characterised by the [[first ascent]]s of many of the [[Alps]]'s most dominant mountains, the subsequent silver age may be seen as consisting of the first ascents of the many worthwhile peaks left unclimbed, although these peaks were – and remained – largely unknown to the wider public in Great Britain.

Once these peaks had been climbed, many ambitious alpinists turned their attention to more distant and often loftier ranges, such as the [[Caucasus]], the [[Andes]], the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] and, latterly, the [[Himalayas]].

Prominent alpinists and guides of the period include [[Christian Almer]], [[Melchior Anderegg]], [[Hermann von Barth]], [[Alexander Burgener]], [[W. A. B. Coolidge]], [[Henri Cordier (mountaineer)|Henri Cordier]], [[Clinton Thomas Dent]], [[James Eccles]], [[Douglas Freshfield|D. W. Freshfield]], [[Pierre Gaspard (mountaineer)|Pierre Gaspard]], [[Paul Grohmann]], [[Paul Güssfeldt]], [[John Oakley Maund]], [[Thomas Middlemore]], [[Adolphus Warburton Moore|A. W. Moore]], [[Albert F. Mummery]], [[Julius Payer]] and [[William Penhall]].

==First ascents in the silver age==

*1881 [[Aiguille du Grépon]], [[Dôme de Rochefort]], [[Kleine Zinne]], [[Totenkirchl]]
*1882 [[Dent du Géant]], [[Paternkofel]]

A number of high, major summits were reached at a still later date, including the [[Aiguille Blanche de Peuterey]] (1885). Many technically challenging peaks, especially in the [[Dolomites]], defeated climbers into the 20th century, with [[Campanile Basso]] (1899),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summitpost.org/campanile-basso-di-brenta/151122 Campanile Basso di Brenta] at summitpost&lt;/ref&gt; [[:de:Campanile di Val Montanaia]] (1902), Torre Venezia (1909), Torre Trieste (1910) and [[Aiguille Dibona]] (1913) perhaps being the last big prizes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7064">:'''''Area code 809''' redirects here. 809 once covered Bermuda and many islands in the Caribbean which have since been allocated their own codes; see '''[[Area codes in the Caribbean]]''' for more details.''

'''Telephone numbers in the [[Dominican Republic]]''' use '''area code 809''' with '''829''' and '''849''' as [[overlay plan|overlay]] codes. [[Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic]] use the [[North American Numbering Plan]] (NANP) country code, 1, followed by the area code in the same form as an internal area code in other NANP countries, such as the US and Canada.

When in the Dominican Republic, the 3-digit area code followed by the 7-digit phone number must be dialed. When calling the Dominican Republic from the [[United States]] or [[Canada]], this must be prefixed by the digit "1". From other countries the international prefix used in the originating country must be dialled before the "1".

==Area code 809==
Area code 809 was created on January 1, 1958. Initially, the 809 area-code was used for all of the Caribbean, with the exception of [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Aruba]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and the [[French West Indies]]. On March 1, 1996, area code 809 was split and eventually just assigned to the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.areacodehelp.com/where/area_code_809.shtml |title=Area code 809 (2/Jan) |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the departure of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] from 809 in 1999, no other countries use the legacy 809 area code. Today, area code 809 and its overlay area codes, 829 and 849, are used solely for the Dominican Republic.

==Area codes 829 and 849==
Area code 829 was added to local telephony as an overlay code, initially optional in July 2005 and later mandatory in November 2005. The new telephony rules were almost wholly due to the explosive growth of [[Mobile phone|cellular]] communication in the Dominican Republic, starting in the mid-1990s with telephone prepaid-cards, and growing incredibly through the early 2000s with the launch of two new cell-phone carriers, Orange and Centennial (now Viva), in addition to the preexisting CODETEL (now Claro Dominicana) and TRICOM (now Altice Dominicana). Besides, the reason for this newly placed dual area code system is because it is estimated a standard 7-digit area code could hold around 7.8 million number combinations,{{fact|date=February 2014}} and currently{{When|date=February 2011}} there are around 1.6 million land-based lines and 4.2 million cellular phones.{{fact|date=February 2014}} Thus it was decided to attach another area-code to this country, because of the extensive growth and threat of number depletion.

In early 2009 a decision was made to add a second overlay code, area code 849. The triple [[area code]] system went into effect on February 15, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/technology/2010/2/13/34813/New-area-code-849-begins-February-15-in-Dominican-Republic |title=New area code 849 begins February 15 in Dominican Republic |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==809 scam and One Ring Scam==

[[Telephone fraud]] scams once revolved around the 809 area code; it was being used since calling international numbers from the United States is charged at a higher rate than domestic calls.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/809.html&lt;/ref&gt; The charge is set jointly by the originating and terminating countries; the foreign country portion of the charge could be very high, and there was no regulation by anyone. There may have been a resurgence with wireless telephones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/809.html&lt;/ref&gt; The victim receives a message on their answering machine to call a number with an 809 area code. Since there were many new area codes being introduced in the US, the victim thinks nothing of it and dials the 809 number. The number dialed is however an international number with a share of the revenue going from the foreign telephone company to the operator of the number (the party that got the call to be placed). The victim could be put on hold indefinitely, and billed for each minute they are on hold. This is a form of [[fraud]], though technically legal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lincmad.com/telesleaze.html&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, a similar scam has emerged due to the prevalence of wireless phones which display callback numbers automatically, known as the "one ring scam". The person perpetuating the scam calls the victim via a robodialer or similar means, sometimes at odd hours of the night, then hangs up when the phone is answered with the hope that they will be curious enough to call the number back. When the victim does this, an automatic $19.95 international call fee is charged to their account, as well as $9.00/min thereafter. Similar scams have been linked to Grenada (area code 473), Antigua (area code 268), Jamaica (area code 876) and the British Virgin Islands (area code 284).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wisconsin.bbb.org/article/BBB-Warns-of-One-Ring-Cell-Phone-Scam-45593 BBB Warns of One Ring Cell Phone Scam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219220901/http://wisconsin.bbb.org/article/BBB-Warns-of-One-Ring-Cell-Phone-Scam-45593 |date=February 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tractus Catena''' is a set of pits in the [[Arcadia quadrangle]] of [[Mars]].  Its location is centered at {{Coord|28.17|N|102.77|W|globe:Mars}} .  It is {{convert|897|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and was named after a classical albedo feature name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature {{!}} Tractus Catena|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/6074|website=usgs.gov|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "Catena" refers to a chain of craters.&lt;ref&gt;https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/DescriptorTerms&lt;/ref&gt;

The line of pits that make up Tractus Catena make it related to [[Fossa (geology)|fossa]] which are common on Mars.

Dark slope streaks are visible in one of the pictures below.  Such streaks are common on Mars. They occur on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark at first. They get lighter with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schorghofer | first1 = N | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2007 | title = Three decades of slope streak activity on Mars | url = | journal = Icarus | volume = 191 | issue = | pages = 132–140 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.04.026 | bibcode=2007Icar..191..132S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes they start in a tiny spot, then spread out and go for hundreds of meters. They have been seen to travel around obstacles, like boulders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.space.com/image_of_day_080730.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that they are avalanches of bright dust that expose a darker underlying layer.

The '''Trans Fly savanna and grasslands''' are a lowland [[ecoregion]] on the south coast of the island of [[New Guinea]] in both the [[Indonesia]]n and [[Papua New Guinea]]n sides of the island. With their monsoon and dry season climate these grasslands  are quite different from the tropical [[rainforest]] that covers most of the island and resemble the landscape of northern [[Australia]] which lies to the south.

The name refers to the [[Fly River]].

==Flora==
The area is mostly grassland that resembles nearby northern Australia and contains areas of [[Eucalyptus]], [[Albizzia]], and [[Melaleuca]] woodland. The grasslands are renewed by regular fires at the end of the dry season.

==Fauna==
While the grasslands are not as rich in wildlife as the rainforests of New Guinea, they are home to a number of endemic species. Mammals of the area include the [[New Guinean planigale]] ''(Planigale novaeguineae)'', [[bronze quoll]] ''(Dasyurus spartacus)'', [[spectacled hare-wallaby]] ''(Lagorchestes conspicillatus)'' and [[dusky pademelon]] ''(Thylogale brunii)''. Birds of the area include the [[Fly River grassbird]] (Megalurus albolimbatus) and the [[spangled kookaburra]], a species of the famous relative of the kingfisher which feeds on rodents and reptiles rather than fish. The area has an important number of reptiles and amphibians including the unique [[pig-nosed turtle]] ''(Carettochelys insculpta)''.

==Threats and preservation==
[[File:Wasur Rainbow 1994.jpg|thumb|250px|Trans Fly savanna and grasslands in [[Wasur National Park]], Indonesia]]
This is a remote area with a large but very localised tribal population. Most habitats are intact although wildlife is vulnerable to collection, hunting and damage by logging and woodland clearance, especially as people migrate into the area on the Indonesian side. The grasslands are also modified by grazing of the introduced [[Javan rusa]] deer ''(Cervus timorensis)''. A third of the region is protected, particularly in Indonesia's large [[Wasur National Park]] on the coast and its adjoining [[Tonda Wildlife Management Area]] across the border in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0708|name=Trans Fly savanna and grasslands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Nations geoscheme''' is a system which divides the countries of the world into [[region]]al and [[subregion]]al groups. It was devised by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD) based on the [[UN M.49|M49 coding classification]].&lt;ref name="Lele2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ajey Lele|title=Asian Space Race: Rhetoric or Reality?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chtAqyOp9OEC&amp;pg=PA8|date=20 October 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-81-322-0733-7|pages=8–|quote=Te best option to identify the states from Asia could be use the United Nations (UN) geoscheme for Asia.

== Usage ==
The creators note that "the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories".&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm Standard country or area codes and geographical regions for statistical use]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNSD geoscheme does not set a standard for the entire [[United Nations System]], and it often differs from geographic definitions used by the autonomous [[United Nations specialized agencies]] for their own organizational convenience. For instance, UNSD includes [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Cyprus]] in Western Asia, yet the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] and [[UNESCO]] include them in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=FAKMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=west+asia+iran+2015&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cWGRVanpKqOy7Qb1tqP4Bw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20asia%20iran%202015&amp;f=false United Nations Industrial Organisation] p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/worldwide/unesco-regions/europe-and-north-america/ Europe and North America], Retrieved: 10 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The schema was created for statistical analysis and consists of macro-geographical regions arranged to the extent possible according to [[continent]]s. Within these groupings, smaller, geographical subregions and selected economic and other groupings allow for detailed analysis.

Other alternative groupings include the [[World Bank]] regional classification,&lt;ref name="Elborgh-WoytekNewiak2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katrin Elborgh-Woytek |author2=Monique Newiak |author3=Kalpana Kochhar |author4=Stefania Fabrizio |author5=Kangni Kpodar |author6=Philippe Wingender |author7=Benedict J.

}}

'''William Robert ('Bill') Freudenburg''', (2 November 1951 &amp;ndash; 28 December 2010) was an environmental [[sociologist]] and [[social theorist]], best known for his work in [[rural sociology]] on the topics of [[risk perception]], [[social disruption]], and the causes of [[environmental degradation]]. Born in [[Madison, Nebraska]], raised in [[West Point, Nebraska]], he was educated at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln|University of Nebraska]] and [[Yale University]]. Freudenburg was a professor of sociology at a number of universities; his ultimate position was as Dehlsen Professor of [[Environmental Studies]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.es.ucsb.edu/faculty/freudenburg.php Faculty web page]. Accessed 2009-12-08. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022120046/http://www.es.ucsb.edu/faculty/freudenburg.php |date=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at his home in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], of [[cholangiocarcinoma]] (cancer of the [[bile duct]]).&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

Much of Freudenburg's research dealt with the relationship between society and the environment, often in rural communities. Although not opposed to forms of [[environmentalism]] which emphasize  reducing one’s impact on the environment (such as [[recycling]]), Freudenburg focused less on the role of consumers and more on the role of [[environmental regulation|regulatory structure]] and actions of industry, emphasizing the socially structured sources of [[environmental impact]]s. He was prominent in both [[Rural sociology|rural]] and [[environmental sociology]], and was elected and served as president of the [[Rural Sociological Society]] in 2004-2005, and at the time of his death was president-elect of the [[Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences]] (AESS), an organization which he helped found.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Education and career==
Freudenburg completed his undergraduate work at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln|University of Nebraska]] and then earned three graduate degrees, including his Ph.D., from [[Yale University]]. He began his professional career at [[Washington State University]], then moved to the [[University of Wisconsin]], where he spent most of his professional career. During that time, a compilation by graduate students found Freudenburg to have published more articles on environment-society relationships in leading journals than anyone else.  While he was still on the faculty at Wisconsin, he was nominated for an endowed professorship at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], which he accepted, and he worked at UCSB until his death.

==Theory of double diversion==
Freudenburg published a number influential ideas, but his central focus in recent years was on what he called the [[double diversion]].  Although in his latter years he taught in the program established in part by [[Garrett Hardin]], and he often stressed his high regard for Hardin's work, the predictions that derive from Freudenburg's double diversion work are contrary to those associated with Hardin's "tragedy of the commons."&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, Garrett, "The Tragedy of the Commons."  Science 162 (13 December 1968): 1243-48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than being due mainly to the actions of individual consumers, Freudenburg argued, much or most of all environmental harm is actually due to a small number of organized producers. Contrary to the notion that environmental protection is bad for the economy and jobs, the worst sources of environmental harm are commonly due to a surprisingly small fraction of all economic activity—and to an even smaller fraction of the jobs. In the first peer-reviewed article in which this perspective was spelled out, for example, Freudenburg found that the majority of all toxic emissions in the U.S. economy came from industries that were responsible for only about 5% of the gross national product—and just 1.4% of the nation's jobs.&lt;ref&gt;William R.

===''Catastrophe in the Making''===
"Catastrophe" was written with Robert Gramling, Shirley B. Laska, and [[Kai T. Erikson]]. It was published in August 2009, on the fourth anniversary of [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]]:  ''Catastrophe in the Making: The Engineering of Katrina and the Disasters of Tomorrow''. (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 2009). Unlike most "Katrina" books, which tend to focus on the hurricane's aftermath, this one discusses the ways in which [[public works]] projects—supposedly designed to bring greater prosperity to [[New Orleans]]—actually had little if any economic benefits, while potentially contributing to the storm's devastation.  Particularly noteworthy in this connection was the [[Mississippi River Gulf Outlet Canal]] (MRGO), which did little to serve as an "outlet" for commerce, but did serve as a major inlet for salt water, which killed much of the vegetation that held together the fragile but formerly healthy wetlands to the southeast of New Orleans. Providing the reader with New Orleans history, engineering data, and scholarly analysis, the authors argue that land development in the region led to the creation of several canals intended to promote economic prosperity, which ironically resulted in the intended economic capital was never realized due to the excessive maintenance costs. Instead, significant human capital was lost in 2005 as the canals and their subsequent environmental degradation exacerbated the impact of Katrina and her deadly floodwaters.

===''Blowout in the Gulf''===
Freudenburg's final published book, written with long-time collaborator Robert Gramling, was released in October 2010. ''Blowout in the Gulf: The BP Oil Spill Disaster and the Future of Energy in America'' (Cambridge MIT Press) puts the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]] in historical and policy perspective.

===''Robbing Nature's Bank''===
Before he died, Freudenburg was working on a book tentatively entitled ''Robbing Nature’s Bank'', which explored learning from problems of the past in order to prevent similar “unnatural disasters” in the future. The manuscript focuses less on the individual factors in harming the environment and points out that a large majority of this harm comes from organizational factors.

The '''WindSled''' or '''Inuit WindSled''' is a project that has as central axis a wind vehicle, unique in the world, to travel and transport equipment through polar lands, and which has been designed by the Spanish [[Polar exploration|polar explorer]], [[Ramón Hernando de Larramendi]].

The vehicle is based on [[Inuit]] tradition, which Larramendi has combined with large kites so that it may progress through the interior of the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] plateau, driven by aeolian energy. It is able to transport up to {{convert|2,000|kg|abbr=on}} of weight As of 2017, the vehicle has successfully covered more than {{convert|20,000|km|abbr=on}}, driven only by the wind, reaching the [[South Pole|Geographic South Pole]], the South [[Pole of Inaccessibility (Antarctic research station)|Pole of Inaccessibility]] and the highest altitude in the interior of [[Greenland]]. The Inuit WindSled has been improving for the last 18 years, during which it has served as a scientific platform for projects of different Spanish and international scientific institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastgrip.org/documentation/2017/EGRIP2017FieldPlan_16.03.2017.pdf EGRIP Field Season 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to develop scientific and geographic exploration projects with zero emissions in polar regions.

== Layout ==
The Inuit WindSled is composed of four articulated modules, each of them made up with wooden rails and crossbars between {{convert|3|and|4.5|m|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|3.7|to|4|m|abbr=on}} in width. This is the so-called 'Larramendi platform', the name of its designer. These rails and crossbars are joined by about 2,000 knots with high resistance ropes, which gives flexibility to adapt to irregularities in the terrain. In the lower part, it has [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] platforms to facilitate sliding.

The first of the modules has a piloting tent where the kite controls are located, but it also has a work space. Next, two modules are attached for the load, and that's where all the equipment goes. The last module has another larger tent for crew rest. With this configuration, it can be divided into two vehicles when terrain and conditions require it.

The WindSled works with kites of different sizes, the largest of {{convert|80|m2|abbr=on}}, depending on wind conditions. Under normal conditions, its perfect average speed is about {{convert|40|km/h|abbr=on}}, although it has reached over {{convert|80|km/h|abbr=on}} in some moments.

It is equipped with [[Solar panel|photovoltaic panels]] for the electrical supply of the scientific and communications equipment it carries on board and all the composing parts can be repaired without the need of external assistance.

== History and evolution ==
After traveling more than {{convert|14,000|km|abbr=on}} through the Arctic, during the [[:es:Expedición Circumpolar|Circumpolar  Expedition]], Ramón H. de Larramendi learned the construction and handling of Inuit sleds and observed the force of the winds in polar territories. It was the germination of the WindSled project.

At the beginning of year 2000, he designed the first models of the vehicle and after performing several tests with fiberglass and wood, he found that the latter, following the Inuit tradition, was much more effective than more modern materials. That same year, he made a first crossing in Greenland of {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} with an incipient design that consisted of a single module with a tent on top. Despite the difficulties, it was a success.

Since then the vehicle, which has been called "polar butterfly", "polar catamaran" and finally Inuit WindSled, has accomplished a total of six expeditions in Greenland and two in Antarctica, with a total distance covered of {{convert|20,000|km|abbr=on}}, and all of them finalizing successfully. The first crossings in Greenland, in the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, strengthened the possibilities of the mobile platform on the polar terrain. It would obtain the '2001 Trip of the Year' Award from the Spanish Geographical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barrabes.com/actualidad/noticias/1-1998/larramendi-naranjo-premiados-sociedad-geografica.html|title=Larramendi y Naranjo, premiados por la Sociedad Geográfica Española|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Right after the 2005-2006 Transantarctic Expedition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/polar/news.php?id=1276|title=Spaniards reach South Pole of Inaccessibility|last=Explorersweb|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the expedition decided to use the vehicle for polar scientific exploration, once possibilities of navigating with a heavy load were proven. In addition to serving for geographic exploration, scientific data could be collected on the crossings. With that objective, in 2012, after the Acciona Antarctica Expedition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/polar/news.php?id=20584|title=ExplorersWeb|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a prototype of two modules was presented to the Spanish polar scientific community at the [[Autonomous University of Madrid]]. It was also presented to the scientific community in Great Britain.

During the 2014 and 2016 expeditions in Greenland, the WindSled designer developed new technical possibilities in two Arctic expeditions, increasing its dimensions. In 2014, the vehicle made the circumnavigation of Greenland by ice, a route of {{convert|4,300|km|abbr=on}} with a prototype of three modules in which four people traveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/ciencia/2014/06/06/53919e72ca474184668b457a.html|title=EL MUNDO. Navegar por el Ártico a bordo de un 'ecotrineo' con alas de mariposa. 06/06/2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, with the Greenland Ice Summit expedition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pythom.com/Windsled-completed-mission-across-Greenland-2016-07-05-25485|title=Windsled completed expedition across Greenland|date=2016-07-05|work=Pythom|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became a convoy of four modules, with a total length of {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}}, a maximum of six people on board in a journey to attain the {{convert|2,000|m|abbr=on}}  level in altitude with two tons of weight. They covered {{convert|2,000|km|abbr=on}}. It was confirmed that, even in extreme conditions, the WindSled was a sustainable and efficient means of transport. The last expedition, 2017 Greenland Ice River, took place in the spring of that year, with five crew on board. It took 28 days to cover {{convert|1,200|km|abbr=on}} and different international scientific projects related to climate change were developed in collaboration with the [[East Greenland Ice-Core Project]] (EastGRIP) scientific base at NEGIS, the [[Dark Snow Project]] and other relevant scientific institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v546/n7659/full/nj7659-565a.html|title=NATURE : Sustainability: A greener culture|last=Julia Rosen|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific research ==
In parallel to these external improvements, the interest of polar scientists has increased. Among the most relevant, the American glaciologist [[Jason Box]], [[Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland]] (GEUS), and the Spaniards, Antonio Quesada, Autonomous University of Madrid and Spanish Polar Program manager, Ignacio López Moreno, Pyrenean Institute of Ecology (CSIC) and Juan José Blanco, [[University of Alcalá]].

With this vehicle drilling has been carried out in the interior of Greenland down to {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}}, collected data on the state of snow, air samples and data concerning cosmic rays.

In 2016, the first scientific results of samples taken on the WindSled Acciona Antarctica expedition were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/ciencia/2016/12/10/58482c30268e3e86568b4612.html|title=Pesticidas en el corazón de la Antártida|last=Herrero|first=Amado|date=|work=EL MUNDO|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation, published in November in the scientific journal ''[[Atmospheric Environment]]'', revealed the existence of [[persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs), from pesticides, in the interior of Antarctica. The main researchers were Jordi Dachs and Ana Cabrerizo, Institute of Environmental Diagnosis and Water Studies (IDAEA-CSIC).

In 2017, polar researcher Ross Edwards, with the international Dark Snow Project,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.darksnow.org/ Dark Snow Project]&lt;/ref&gt; participated as part of the expedition crew in Greenland, collecting data for the project.
