'''''A Cavalryman''''' is a 19th century painting by French artist [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville]]. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a French cavalryman on a yellow field. The work is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

== Description ==
''Cavalryman'' depicts a French [[dragoon]] of the [[Second French Empire]]. Dragoons were mounted infantry capable of riding into on an engagement on horses before dismounting to engage enemy forces on foot; this important role, coupled with the cost of horses, resulted in dragoons being known as elite-but-expensive troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.napolun.com/mirror/web2.airmail.net/napoleon/cavalry_Napoleon.html|title=Napoleon's Cavalry (Cuirassiers, Dragoons, Lancers, Chasseurs, Hussars)|last=me|website=www.napolun.com|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dragoons became a subject of various works of military art, including the works of [[Ernest Meissonier]], whos style De Neuville directly emulated in ''A'' ''Cavalryman''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437220?searchField=All&amp;amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;amp;ao=on&amp;amp;od=on&amp;amp;ft=Military&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;rpp=80&amp;amp;pos=59|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437052|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting itself was produced after the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] resulted an upsurge of interest in the military in the [[French Third Republic]]. As noted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, De Neuville "capitalized on the intense patriotism and dreams of military glory that the French defeat aroused" with his work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">'''Action''' as a term in Western [[theatre]] practice refers to a principle from [[actor]] training first developed by Russian actor and theatre director [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] in the first half of the 20th century at the [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. It forms part of his overall structure of systematized acting training, most frequently called the System, which in its turn gave rise to [[Method Acting]].

In his writings on theatre, Stanislavski states "The basis of theatre is doing, dynamism. [...] In Latin, the corresponding word is actio, and the root of this same word has passed into our vocabulary, "''action''", "''actor''", "''act''". So, drama is an action we can see being performed, and, when he comes on, the actor becomes an agent in that action"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanislavski|first=Konstantin (transl. Jean Benedetti)|title=An Actor's Work: A Student's Diary|year=2008|publisher=Routlege|location=Abingdon|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "acting is action - mental and physical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanislavski|first=Konstantin (transl. Jean Benedetti)|title=An Actor's Work: A Student's Diary|year=2008|publisher=Routlege|location=Abingdon|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Benedetti understands action in a Stanislavskian context more simply as "What is done in order to fulfill a Task," a Task in its turn referring to "What a character has to do, the problem he has to solve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benedetti|first=Jean|title=Stanislavski and the Actor: The Final Acting Lessons|year=2008|publisher=Methuen|location=London|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action as a term in theatre practice derived from the Stanislavski System therefore refers to that which a [[character (arts)|character]] undertakes in order to achieve a goal.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2016}}
'''Altermodern''', a [[portmanteau word]] defined by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]], is an attempt at contextualizing art made in today's global context as a reaction against standardisation and commercialism. It is also the title of the [[Tate Britain]]'s fourth Triennial exhibition curated by Bourriaud.

==Concept==
In his keynote speech to the 2005 Art Association of Australia &amp; New Zealand Conference, Nicolas Bourriaud explained:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/aaanz05/abstracts/nicolas_bourriaud ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723130718/http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/aaanz05/abstracts/nicolas_bourriaud |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Artists are looking for a new modernity that would be based on translation: What matters today  is to translate the cultural values of cultural groups and  to connect them to the world network. This “reloading process” of  modernism according to the twenty-first-century issues could be called altermodernism, a movement connected to the creolisation of cultures and the fight for autonomy, but also the possibility of producing singularities in a more and more standardized world.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Altermodern can essentially be read as an artist working in a [[hypermodernity|hypermodern]] world or with supermodern ideas or themes.

==Exhibitions==

===Tate Britain 2009===
The Tate exhibition includes a series of four one-day events (called "Prologues"), aiming to "introduce and provoke debate" around the Triennial’s themes. Each Prologue includes lectures, performances, film and a manifesto text and attempts to define what the curator sees as the four main facets of Altermodern&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/tate-triennial-2009-prologue-1-okwui-enwezor-specious-modernity-speculations]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anna Alekseyevna Chelishcheva''' ({{lang-ru|Анна Алексеевна Челищева}}, April 7, 1848, [[Vladimir (city)|Vladimir]], [[Russian Empire]] – November 15, 1934, [[Moscow]], [[USSR]]), better known by her stage name '''Anna Brenko''' (Анна Бренко′), was a Russian, Soviet [[stage actress]], [[theatre]] [[entrepreneur]], [[playwright]] and [[memoirist]], honored with the [[Meritorious Artist|Meritorious Artist of RSFSR]] title in 1924.

==Life==
Brenko was born in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1848 and she first worked as a teacher. She trained as an actress in St Petersburg and she married Iosif Levenson who was a music critic.&lt;ref name="Senelick2015"/&gt;

Having made herself a name at the [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]] where she organised concerts to gather funds for exiles in Siberia. The banker Melkiel backed her plans and she launched the first ever Russian private theatre in 1880 (officially called A.A. Brenko Drama Theatre, popularly known as the Pushkin Theatre, but only because it was situated close to the [[Pushkin Square]] in Moscow).&lt;ref name="Schuler2013"/&gt; Brenko paid much higher salaries, insisted on new scenery and three week rehearsals for productions that included works by [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Aleksandr Ostrovsky]].&lt;ref name="Senelick2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurence Senelick|title=Historical Dictionary of Russian Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mx5lCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75|date=13 August 2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-4927-1|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brenko shared the management decisions with actors [[Modest Pisarev]] and [[Vasili Andreev-Burlak]] it was her final say.&lt;ref name="Schuler2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Schuler|title=Women in Russian Theatre: The Actress in the Silver Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAwgjV_YGgkC&amp;pg=PA122|date=17 June 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-15597-0|pages=115–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brenko was driven by the artistic event and she was exploited by other actors and directors.&lt;ref name="Schuler2013"/&gt;

The theatre folded for financial reasons in 1882 (to be later purchased by the entrepreneur [[Fyodor Korsh]]), Brenko taught drama (in 1890–1905 in her own theatre college) and in 1915 opened the free-for-all Workers' Theatre where in the course of two years 25 plays had been produced.

Not only did Anna Brenko embrace the [[1917 October Revolution]], but, as a 69-year-old, she enlisted in the [[Red Army]] to perform with some of her troupe's actors, at battle fronts. Anna Brenko authored four plays (1883–1916) and six books of memoirs (1924–1933).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/teatr_i_kino/BRENKO_ANNA_ALEKSEEVNA.html Анна Алексеевна Бренко] at the Krugosvet Online Encyclopedia // Энциклопедия Кругосвет&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://istoriya-teatra.ru/theatre/item/f00/s01/e0001531/index.shtml The Russian Theatre's Hisrotry].

The '''Ardennes Cross''' is a wooden [[processional cross]] from the [[Carolingian period]], said to originate in a monastery in the Luxembourg [[Ardennes]]. Since 1894 it has been in the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] in Nuremberg (inventory number 763&amp;nbsp;kg).

Probably made between 825 and 850 in northern France by an unknown craftsman, it is 73&amp;nbsp;cm high, studded with gold and set with gems and coloured glass. It is one of the few surviving examples of a [[crux gemmata]] from the Carolingian period. These crosses were used in Christian liturgy between the 5th and 12th centuries, placed on the altar but without a figure of Christ. Their symbolic meaning and the impression given from a distance was more important than the cross' value and so (as here) coloured glass was also used alongside gemstones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10831">In [[mathematics]], an '''automorphism''' is an [[isomorphism]] from a [[mathematical object]] to itself. It is, in some sense, a [[symmetry]] of the object, and a way of [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the '''automorphism group'''. It is, loosely speaking, the [[symmetry group]] of the object.

==Definition==
In the context of [[abstract algebra]], a mathematical object is an [[algebraic structure]] such as a [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], or [[vector space]]. An '''automorphism''' is simply a [[bijective]] [[homomorphism]] of an object with itself. (The definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure; see, for example, [[group homomorphism]], [[ring homomorphism]], and [[linear operator]]).

The [[identity morphism]] ([[identity mapping]]) is called the '''trivial automorphism''' in some contexts. Respectively, other (non-identity) automorphisms are called '''nontrivial automorphisms'''.

The exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of "mathematical object" in question and what, precisely, constitutes an "isomorphism" of that object. The most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called [[category theory]]. Category theory deals with abstract objects and [[morphism]]s between those objects.

In category theory, an '''automorphism''' is an [[endomorphism]] (i.e., a [[morphism]] from an object to itself) which is also an [[isomorphism]] (in the categorical sense of the word).

This is a very abstract definition since, in category theory, morphisms aren't necessarily functions and objects aren't necessarily sets. In most concrete settings, however, the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure.

==Automorphism group==
If the automorphisms of an object {{var|X}} form a set (instead of a proper [[class (set theory)|class]]), then they form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[Function composition|composition]] of [[morphism]]s. This group is called the '''automorphism group''' of {{var|X}}.
;[[Closure (binary operation)|Closure]]: Composition of two automorphisms is another automorphism.
;[[Associativity]]: It is part of the definition of a category that composition of morphisms is associative.
;[[Identity element|Identity]]: The identity is the identity morphism from an object to itself, which is an automorphism.
;[[Inverse element|Inverses]]: By definition every isomorphism has an inverse which is also an isomorphism, and since the inverse is also an endomorphism of the same object it is an automorphism.

The automorphism group of an object ''X'' in a category ''C'' is denoted Aut&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), or simply Aut(''X'') if the category is clear from context.

==Examples==
* In [[set theory]], an arbitrary [[permutation]] of the elements of a set ''X'' is an automorphism. The automorphism group of ''X'' is also called the [[symmetric group]] on ''X''.
* In [[elementary arithmetic]], the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''', considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism: negation. Considered as a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], however, it has only the trivial automorphism. Generally speaking, negation is an automorphism of any [[abelian group]], but not of a ring or field.
* A group automorphism is a [[group isomorphism]] from a group to itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group ''G'' there is a natural group homomorphism ''G'' → Aut(''G'') whose [[image (mathematics)|image]] is the group Inn(''G'') of [[inner automorphism]]s and whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G''. Thus, if ''G'' has [[Trivial group|trivial]] center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group.&lt;ref name=Pahl&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvoaoWOfqd8C&amp;pg=PA376 |page=376 |chapter=§7.5.5 Automorphisms |title=Mathematical foundations of computational engineering |edition=Felix Pahl translation |author=PJ Pahl, R Damrath |isbn=3-540-67995-2 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[linear algebra]], an endomorphism of a [[vector space]] ''V'' is a [[linear transformation|linear operator]] ''V'' → ''V''. An automorphism is an invertible linear operator on ''V''. When the vector space is finite-dimensional, the automorphism group of ''V'' is the same as the [[general linear group]], GL(''V'').
* A field automorphism is a [[bijection|bijective]] [[ring homomorphism]] from a [[field (mathematics)|field]] to itself. In the cases of the [[rational number]]s ('''Q''') and the [[real number]]s ('''R''') there are no nontrivial field automorphisms. Some subfields of '''R''' have nontrivial field automorphisms, which however do not extend to all of '''R''' (because they cannot preserve the property of a number having a square root in '''R'''). In the case of the [[complex number]]s, '''C''', there is a unique nontrivial automorphism that sends '''R''' into '''R''': [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]], but there are infinitely ([[uncountable|uncountably]]) many "wild" automorphisms (assuming the [[axiom of choice]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yale | first = Paul B. | journal = Mathematics Magazine | title = Automorphisms of the Complex Numbers | volume = 39 | issue = 3 |date=May 1966 | pages = 135–141 | url = http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/PaulBYale.pdf | doi = 10.2307/2689301 | jstor = 2689301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Lounesto |first=Pertti |year=2001 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |title=Clifford Algebras and Spinors | edition = 2nd |pages= 22–23|isbn=0-521-00551-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Field automorphisms are important to the theory of [[field extension]]s, in particular [[Galois extension]]s. In the case of a Galois extension ''L''/''K'' the [[subgroup]] of all automorphisms of ''L'' fixing ''K'' pointwise is called the [[Galois group]] of the extension.
* The automorphism group of the [[quaternion]]s ('''H''') as a ring are the inner automorphisms, by the [[Skolem–Noether theorem]]: maps of the form {{nowrap|''a'' ↦ ''bab''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.{{refn|{{citation|year=2003|title=Handbook of algebra|volume=3|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|page=453}}}}. This group is [[Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation|isomorphic]] to [[SO(3)]], the group of rotations in 3-dimensional space.
* The automorphism group of the [[octonions]] ('''O''') is the exceptional Lie group [[G2_(mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].
* In [[graph theory]] an [[graph automorphism|automorphism of a graph]] is a permutation of the nodes that preserves edges and non-edges. In particular, if two nodes are joined by an edge, so are their images under the permutation.
* In [[geometry]], an automorphism may be called a [[motion (geometry)|motion]] of the space. Specialized terminology is also used:
** In [[metric geometry]] an automorphism is a self-[[isometry]]. The automorphism group is also called the [[isometry group]].
** In the category of [[Riemann surface]]s, an automorphism is a [[biholomorphy|biholomorphic]] map (also called a [[conformal map]]), from a surface to itself. For example, the automorphisms of the [[Riemann sphere]] are [[Möbius transformation]]s.
** An automorphism of a differentiable [[manifold]] ''M'' is a [[diffeomorphism]] from ''M'' to itself. The automorphism group is sometimes denoted Diff(''M'').
** In [[topology]], morphisms between topological spaces are called [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous maps]], and an automorphism of a topological space is a [[homeomorphism]] of the space to itself, or self-homeomorphism (see [[homeomorphism group]]). In this example it is ''not sufficient'' for a morphism to be bijective to be an isomorphism.

==History==
One of the earliest group automorphisms (automorphism of a group, not simply a group of automorphisms of points) was given by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1856, in his [[icosian calculus]], where he discovered an order two automorphism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;so that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a new fifth root of unity, connected with the former fifth root &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; by relations of perfect reciprocity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Inner and outer automorphisms==
{{main article|Inner automorphism|Outer automorphism group}}
In some categories—notably [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[Lie algebra]]s—it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types, called "inner" and "outer" automorphisms.

In the case of groups, the [[inner automorphism]]s are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself. For each element ''a'' of a group ''G'', conjugation by ''a'' is the operation {{nowrap|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''G'' → ''G''}} given by {{nowrap|1=''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') = ''aga''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} (or ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''ga''; usage varies). One can easily check that conjugation by ''a'' is a group automorphism. The inner automorphisms form a [[normal subgroup]] of Aut(''G''), denoted by Inn(''G''); this is called [[Goursat's lemma]].

The other automorphisms are called [[outer automorphism]]s. The [[quotient group]] {{nowrap|Aut(''G'') / Inn(''G'')}} is usually denoted by Out(''G''); the non-trivial elements are the [[cosets]] that contain the outer automorphisms.

The same definition holds in any [[unital algebra|unital]] [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] or [[algebra over a field|algebra]] where ''a'' is any [[Unit (ring theory)|invertible element]]. For [[Lie algebra]]s the definition is slightly different.

'''Bazar square''' ({{lang-az|Bazar meydanı}}) or '''Khanqah complex''' ({{lang-az|Xanəgah kompleksi}}) is a historic religious-architectural complex with [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] of XII-XIII centuries. It is a part of [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]] and located on Kichik Gala street, in the city of [[Baku]], in [[Azerbaijan]]. It was also registered as a national architectural monument by the decision of the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan|Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] dated August 2, 2001, No. 132.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azərbaycan Respublikası ərazisində dövlət mühafizəsinə götürülmüş daşınmaz tarix və mədəniyyət abidələrinin əhəmiyyət dərəcələrinə görə bölgüsünün təsdiq edilməsi haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikası Nazirlər Kabinetinin qərarı|url=http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/2847|website=e-qanun.az|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex was discovered during archeological excavations carried out in 1964 on the northern side of the [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]].&lt;ref name="icherisheher"&gt;{{cite web|title= BAZAR MEYDANI (Sıratağlı dini-memarlıq kompleksi)|url= http://www.icherisheher.gov.az/static,20/lang,az/#monument32|publisher= icherisheher.gov.az|language= az|accessdate= March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheheraz"&gt;{{cite web|title= SIRATAĞLI DİNİ – MEMARLIQ KOMPLEKSİ|url= http://www.icherisheher.az/az/61-sirataghli-religious-architectural-complex|publisher= icherisheher.az|language= az|accessdate= March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Structure==
The structure of the monument is similar to [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Al-Masjid Al-Ḥarām]] for its coverage with pavement and arcades. 52 graves were discovered in the area as a result of the archaeological excavations. Most of the graves are specially preserved. Graves in the territory of the monument and under the arches are believed to be belonging to those deceased persons. According to Islamic traditions, some people bequeathed to be buried in sacred places. When the sacred place was too far away, the person was buried in nearby places. The found cultural monuments and graves reflects opinions of the archaeologist, which means the place was once a pilgrimage.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheherazz"&gt;{{cite web|title= Bazar Meydanı (Sıratağlı dini-memarlıq kompleksi)|url= http://www.icherisheher.az/az/56-other-monuments|publisher= icherisheher.az|language= az|accessdate= March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the yard, near the graves, a cylindrical well and at a certain distance, on south-eastern side, a large eight-pointed column were discovered. The column stands on a three-tiered pavement, which was built of stone. Its height is 1.31 meters and thickness is 48&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheherazz"/&gt;

==Career==
Franklin first appeared on television at age 9 in ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]''.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; As a small child, she later appeared in a non-credited role in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[The Wrong Man]]''. In the 1960s, she portrayed a teenage feature character in "You're the Judge," a short educational film about baking sponsored by [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] and featuring the use of [[Crisco]]. She debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1970 in the musical [[Applause (musical)|''Applause'']], earning a [[Tony Award]] nomination.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Her recording of [[Applause (Bonnie Franklin song)|"Applause"]], the show's title track, was the most successful Broadway song of the season, vocally upstaging the star of the show, [[Lauren Bacall]]. Although she was on stage for only a fraction of the running time of that show, Franklin attracted a lot of attention. In its July 1970 edition, for example, ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' published a photo spread in which the magazine predicted big careers for three young women: [[Melba Moore]], [[Sandy Duncan]], and Franklin.

Franklin appeared at the [[Paper Mill Playhouse]] in [[Millburn, New Jersey]] in both ''[[George M!]]'' and ''[[A Thousand Clowns]]''. From June 22 through September 2, 1973, she appeared as Carrie Pepperidge in a production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]" at the Jones Beach Theater on Long Island in New York in a cast that included [[John Cullum]] and Barbara Meister.

She guest-starred on several television series, including ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' ("The Gazebo in the Maze Affair" from 1965) and ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]''  ("Hazel Sits It Out" from 1965). She had a semi-regular role in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[Gidget (TV series)|Gidget]]''. She directed several episodes of the 1980s sitcom ''[[Charles in Charge]]'' and the syndicated comedy series ''[[The Munsters Today]]''.

Franklin was best known for her portrayal of divorced mother Ann Romano on the television [[situation comedy]] ''[[One Day at a Time]]'' (1975–1984). In April 2011, Franklin and other cast members from ''One Day at a Time'' accepted the "Innovators Award" from the [[TV Land]] cable channel—one of several awards in the annual event. The citation on the TV Land web site reads: {{Quote|the Innovator Award...is given to a television series that carved out new territory, tackled important issues of its day and helped re-defined its genre. The series ''One Day at a Time'' was a hybrid drama/comedy, addressed such taboo topics as pre-marital sex, suicide, sexual harassment and more, breaking barriers and paving the way for future shows to tackle these issues as well. Developed and written in part by TV visionary [[Norman Lear]], ''One Day At A Time'' aired on CBS for nine seasons from 1975–1984. Starring Bonnie Franklin, [[Valerie Bertinelli]] and [[Mackenzie Phillips]] as Ann Romano, Barbara Cooper and Julie Cooper, the series revolved around a family headed by a single mother (Franklin) that relocates to Indianapolis, where their new apartment building super, Dwayne Schneider ([[Pat Harrington Jr.]]), befriends them. Also taking part in the cast reunion is Glenn Scarpelli, who joined the series in 1980 as the son of Ann's boyfriend, Nick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvland.com/shows/tv-land-awards TV Land website]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1988, Franklin appeared at the [[Bucks County Playhouse]] and at the Pocono Playhouse, both in Pennsylvania, in the title role of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''. Also in 1988, she appeared with [[Tony Musante]] at the Westside Arts Theatre (in Manhattan) in ''[[Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune]]'' by [[Terrence McNally]]. She later performed in ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' at the Pittsburgh Public Theater (July 1998). In 1997, she appeared at [[Ford's Theatre]], [[Washington, D.C.]], in ''All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten'' (September 1999). In 2005, she appeared with [[Bruce Weitz]] at the New Theatre Restaurant in [[Overland Park, Kansas]] in ''2 Across'' (August–September 2011). She played "Ouiser" in a production of ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' at the Rubicon Theater, [[Ventura, California]] (October 4–October 14, 2011).

In the mid and late 2000s, Franklin appeared in nearly a dozen staged readings in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]] with [[Classic and Contemporary American Playwrights]] (CCAP), which she founded in 2001 with her sister Judy.&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt; During the 2006–2007 season, she appeared in the drama ''[[Toys in the Attic (play)|Toys in the Attic]]'', written by [[Lillian Hellman]]. She appeared in [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Broadway Bound]]'' at the Pico Playhouse in January 2008.

In 2005, she was reunited with her ''One Day at a Time'' co-stars Mackenzie Phillips, Valerie Bertinelli and Pat Harrington for the 60-minute [[CBS]] TV special retrospective ''[[One_Day_at_a_Time#Cast_reunions|The One Day at a Time Reunion]]''. In 2011, she was reunited once again with Bertinelli on ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', playing the mother of Bertinelli's character's boyfriend.

On April 28, 2012, she was among several stars who appeared at the 28th annual Southland Theatre Artists Goodwill Event (STAGE) benefit, titled ''Original Cast 3'', at the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills to benefit [[AIDS Project Los Angeles]]. The event raised more than $200,000 for APLA's work with clients living with [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] in Los Angeles County. Franklin and other original-cast members from a variety of musicals performed songs with which they are associated. Franklin sang the title song from ''Applause'', which she had originally introduced on Broadway in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatermania.com/los-angeles-theater/news/05-2012/photo-flash-patrick-cassidy-bonnie-franklin-andrea_56328.html |title=Photo Flash: Patrick Cassidy, Bonnie Franklin, Andrea McArdle, Sally Struthers at Original Cast 3 Benefit |publisher=Theatermania.com |date=May 8, 2012 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin appeared in several episodes of the daytime drama ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''. The episodes were broadcast in August 2012, and only a month later she was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. The actress was cast as a nun, Sister Celeste, who came to the assistance of [[Victor Newman (fictional character)|Victor Newman]] when he had amnesia while working at a shipping port in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Busis |first=Hillary |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/07/16/young-and-the-restless-victor|title='Young and the Restless' casts Bonnie Franklin as a nun |journal=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her work in the theater and on television, Franklin performed in cabaret at various venues, including Le Mouches, Grand Finale, The Eighty-Eights, Triad, and The Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel — all in New York City — and at Odette's in New Hope, Pennsylvania.

She was scheduled to appear in Joan Didion's one-woman play ''[[The Year of Magical Thinking]]'' at the Ensemble Theatre Company of Santa Barbara in April 2013, but withdrew because of illness.

==Marriages==
Franklin was married twice, first to playwright Ronald Sossi from 1967–1970, and then to film producer [[Marvin Minoff]] for 29 years, from 1980 until his death on November 11, 2009.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news |title=Producer Marvin Minoff dies at 78 - Worked on Frost-Nixon TV interview specials |url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/news/producer-marvin-minoff-dies-at-78-1118011298/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 13, 2009 |accessdate=December 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marvin Minoff obituary |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?n=marvin-minoff&amp;pid=135914438 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=November 13, 2009 |accessdate=November 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minoff had been the [[executive producer]] of a [[television movie]], ''Portrait of a Rebel: The Remarkable Mrs. Sanger'', which starred Franklin as [[Margaret Sanger]], before the couple married in 1980.

{{Culture of Brazil}}
'''Brazilian literature''' is the literature written in the [[Portuguese language]] by Brazilians or in [[Brazil]], including works written prior to the country’s [[Independence of Brazil|independence in 1822]]. Throughout its early years, literature from Brazil followed the literary trends of [[Portugal]], whereas gradually shifting to a different and authentic writing style in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, in the search for truly Brazilian themes and use of the Portuguese language.

Portuguese is a [[Romance dialect]] and the sole official language of Brazil. Lyrically, the poet [[Olavo Bilac]], named it " ''(...) desconhecida e obscura./ Tuba de alto clangor, lira singela,/ Que tens o trom e o silvo da procela,/ E o arrolo da saudade e da ternura!'' ",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arnaldo Nogueira Jr |url=http://www.releituras.com/olavobilac_lingua.asp |title=Olavo Bilac - Lнngua portuguesa |website=Releituras.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which roughly translates as "(...) unknown and obscure,/ Tuba of high blare, delicate lyre,/ That holds the frill and the hiss of the tempest/ And the singing of the [[saudade]] and of the tenderness!"

Brazil’s most significant literary award is the [[Camões Prize]], which it shares with the entire Portuguese [[sprachraum]]. As of 2016, Brazil has eleven recipients of the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bn.br/explore/premios-literarios/premio-camoes-literatura |title=Prêmio Camões de Literatura &amp;#124; Biblioteca Nacional |language=pt |website=Bn.br |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil also holds its own literary academy, the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]], a non-profit cultural organization pointed in perpetuating the care of the national language and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academia.org.br/academia/quem-somos |title=Quem somos &amp;#124; Academia Brasileira de Letras |language=pt |website=Academia.org.br |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian literature has been very prolific. Having as birth the [[letter of Pero Vaz de Caminha]], the document that marks the [[discovery of Brazil]], the country’s literature has encompassed several significant writers. Major figures include novelists [[Machado de Assis]], [[Guimarães Rosa]], [[Jorge Amado]], [[Clarice Lispector]] and [[Graciliano Ramos]]; poets such as [[João Cabral de Melo Neto]], [[Mario de Andrade]], [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]], [[Vinicius de Moraes]], [[Ferreira Gullar]] and [[Manuel Bandeira]]; dramatists like [[Nelson Rodrigues]] and [[Augusto Boal]], and literary critics and theorists as [[Antonio Candido]] and [[Otto Maria Carpeaux]], among others.

==Colonial period==
One of the first extant documents that might be considered Brazilian literature is the ''[[Carta de Pero Vaz de Caminha]]'' (Pero Vaz de Caminha's letter). It is written by [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]] to [[Manuel I of Portugal]], which contains a description of what [[Brazil]] looked like in 1500. Journals of voyagers and descriptive treatises on "Portuguese America" dominated the literary production for the next two centuries, including well-known accounts by [[Jean de Léry]] and [[Hans Staden]], whose story of his encounter with the [[Tupi Indians]] on the coast of São Paulo was extraordinarily influential for European conceptions of the New World.

A few more explicitly literary examples survive from this period, such as [[Basílio da Gama]]'s epic poem celebrating the conquest of the [[Guarany Missions|Missions]] by the Portuguese, and the work of [[Gregório de Matos]], a 17th-century [[lawyer]] from [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]] who produced a sizable amount of [[satire|satirical]], religious, and secular [[poetry]]. Matos drew heavily from [[Baroque]] influences such as the [[Spain|Spanish]] poets [[Luis de Góngora]] and [[Francisco de Quevedo]].

[[Neoclassicism]] was widespread in Brazil during the mid-18th century, following the [[Italy|Italian]] style. Literature was often produced by members of temporary or semi-permanent academies and most of the content was in the [[pastoral]] genre. The most important literary centre in colonial Brazil was the prosperous [[Minas Gerais]] region, known for its [[gold mine]]s, where a thriving [[proto-nationalist]] movement had begun. The most important poets were [[Cláudio Manuel da Costa]], [[Tomás António Gonzaga]], [[Alvarenga Peixoto]] and [[Manuel Inácio da Silva Alvarenga]], all them involved in an uprising against the colonial power. Gonzaga and Costa were exiled to Africa as a consequence.

==Romanticism==
Neoclassicism, lasted for an unnaturally long time, stifling innovation and restricting literary creation. It was only in 1836 that [[Romanticism]] began influencing Brazilian poetry on a large scale, principally through the efforts of the expatriate poet [[Gonçalves de Magalhães, Viscount of Araguaia|Gonçalves de Magalhães]]. A number of young poets, such as [[Casimiro de Abreu]], began experimenting with the new style soon afterward. This period produced some of the first standard works of Brazilian literature.

The key features of the literature of the newborn country are exaggerated affect, nationalism, celebration of nature and the initial introduction of colloquial language. Romantic literature soon became very popular. Novelists like [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]], [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida]] and [[José de Alencar]] published their works in [[Serial (literature)|serial]] form in the newspapers and became national celebrities.

Around 1850, a transition began, centered on [[Álvares de Azevedo]]. Azevedo's short story collection ''[[Noite na Taverna]]'' ({{lang-en|A Night at the Tavern}}) and his poetry, collected posthumously in ''[[Lira dos Vinte Anos]]'' ({{lang-en|Twenty-year-old Lyre}}), became influential. Azevedo was largely influenced by the poetry of [[Lord Byron]] and [[Alfred de Musset]]. This second Romantic generation was obsessed with morbidity and death.

At the same time, poets such as [[Castro Alves]], who wrote of the horrors of slavery (''Navio Negreiro''), began writing works with a specific progressive social agenda. The two trends coincided in one of the most important accomplishments of the Romantic era: the establishment of a Brazilian national identity based on [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Indian]] ancestry and the rich nature of the country. These traits first appeared in [[Gonçalves Dias]]' narrative poem ''[[I-Juca-Pirama]]'', but soon became widespread. The consolidation of this subgenre (''[[Indianism (arts)|Indianism]]'') is found in two famous novels by [[José de Alencar]]: ''[[The Guarani]]'', about a family of Portuguese colonists who took Indians as servants but were later slain by an enemy tribe, and ''[[Iracema]]'', about a Portuguese shipwrecked man who lives among the Indians and marries a beautiful Indian woman. ''Iracema'' is especially lyrical, opening with five paragraphs of pure free-style [[prose poetry]] describing the title character.&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Realism==
The decline of Romanticism, along with a series of social transformations, occurred in the middle of the 19th century. A new form of [[prose]] writing emerged, including analysis of the indigenous people and description of the environment, in the ''regionalist'' authors (such as [[Franklin Távora]] and [[João Simões Lopes Neto]]). Under the influence of [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] and of writers like [[Émile Zola]], [[Aluísio Azevedo]] wrote ''O Cortiço'', with characters that represent all social classes and categories of the time. Brazilian Realism was not very original at first, but it took on extraordinary importance because of [[Machado de Assis]] and [[Euclides da Cunha]].

===Machado de Assis===
Perhaps the most important writer of Brazilian Realism is [[Machado de Assis|Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis]] (1839–1908), the natural son of a half-black wallpainter and a Portuguese woman, whose only education, besides literacy classes, was the extensive reading of borrowed books.

Working as typesetter at a publishing house, he was soon acquainted with most of the world's literature and became fluent in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. In his early career he wrote several best-selling novels (including ''[[A Mão e a Luva]]'' and ''[[Ressurreição]]'') which, despite their overzealous Romanticism, already show his vivacious humour and some of his pessimism towards the conventions of society.

After being introduced to [[Literary realism|Realism]], Machado de Assis changed his style and his themes, producing some of the most remarkable prose ever written in Portuguese. The style served as the medium for his corrosive humour and his intense pessimism, which was very far from the plain conceptions of his contemporaries.

Machado's most crucial works include:
* ''[[Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas]]'' (''Brás Cubas' Posthumous Memoirs''), the fictional [[autobiography]] of a recently deceased man, written by himself "from beyond". It is entirely anti-Romantic and ridicules the society of [[Rio de Janeiro]] of the time. This book contains one of the most pitiless sentences about love ever written: "Marcela amou-me durante quinze meses e onze contos de réis; nada menos". (Marcela loved me for fifteen months and eleven thousand [[Brazilian real (old)|réis]]; nothing less.)
* ''[[Dom Casmurro]]'' purports to be the autobiography of a lonely man who has left his wife and his only son after enjoying years of happy conjugal life. The novel is famous in the Portuguese-speaking world for its analysis of a (possible, but never proven or admitted) case of [[adultery]].
* ''[[Quincas Borba]]''
* ''[[O Alienista]]'', the short story about a [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] who founds a hospital for the mentally ill in a small town and later engages in profound investigations on the nature and the cure of mental illness, greatly upsetting the town's lifestyle.

Machado was also a minor poet, writing mostly casual poetry of extraordinary correctness and beauty. His reputation as a novelist has kept his poetry in print, and recent criticism has regarded it better than that of many of his contemporaries.

== Pre-Modernism ==
{{History of modern literature}}
The period between 1895 and 1922 is called Pre-Modernism by Brazilian scholars because, though there is no clear predominance of any style, there are some early manifestations of Modernism. The Pre-Modern era is curious, as the French school of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] did not catch on and most authors of Realism still maintained their earlier styles and their reputations (including [[Machado de Assis]] and poet [[Olavo Bilac]]). Some authors of this time were [[Monteiro Lobato]], [[Lima Barreto]], [[Simões Lopes Neto]] and [[Augusto dos Anjos]].

===Euclides da Cunha===
An acclaimed writer highly influenced by [[determinism]], [[Euclides da Cunha|Cunha]] was always tormented by his family problems (he was killed by his wife's lover) and had to face political opposition because of his opinions. As a freelance journalist working for ''[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]'' he covered the [[Canudos War]]—a popular revolt with some egalitarian and Christian-fundamentalist traits that took place in [[Bahia]] in 1895-97. His stories, together with some essays he wrote about the people and the geography of the Brazilian North-East, were published in a thick volume called ''[[Os Sertões]]'' (''Rebellion in the Backlands'').

In his work Cunha put forward the revolutionary thesis that the Brazilian state was a violent and foreign entity, rejected (but often tolerated) by the vast majority of the illiterate and dispossessed population, some of whom preserved beliefs and behaviours that had not changed in a thousand years or more. He discovered, for instance, that [[Sebastianism]] was then present in the Brazilian North-East and that many medieval Portuguese rhymes, folk-tales and traditions were still kept by the coarse people of the "sertões". This population did not accept [[secularism]], the [[Republic]]an government and, especially, justice or peace.

His trilogy [[Os Sertões]] is composed of three parts titled "The Land", "The Man" and "The fight". Such organization of the book reinforces the idea that the environment where a man was born, the social aspects of his residence and the man's culture may define what he will become. This principle is known as [[determinism]], a way of thought that deeply influenced Brazilian literature during the mid- and late 19th century and the early 20th century.

== Modernism ==
[[Modernism]] began in Brazil with the [[Week of Modern Art]], in 1922. The ''1922 Generation'' was a nickname for the writers [[Mário de Andrade]] (''[[Paulicéia Desvairada]]'', ''[[Macunaíma (novel)|Macunaíma]]''), [[Oswald de Andrade]] (''[[Memórias Sentimentais de João Miramar]]''), [[Manuel Bandeira]], [[Cassiano Ricardo]] and others, all of whom combined nationalist tendencies with an interest in European modernism.  Some new movements such as [[surrealism]] were already important in Europe, and began to take hold in Brazil during this period.

=== Mário de Andrade ===
[[Mário de Andrade]] was born in [[São Paulo]]. He worked as a professor and was one of the organizers of the Week of Modern Art. He researched Brazilian [[folklore]] and [[folk music]] and used it in his books, avoiding the European style. His Brazilian anti-hero is [[Macunaíma (novel)|Macunaíma]], a product of ethnical and cultural mixture.  Andrade's interest in folklore and his use of colloquial language were extremely influential.

=== Oswald de Andrade ===
[[Oswald de Andrade]], another participant in the Week of Modern Art in 1922, worked as a journalist in [[São Paulo]]. Born into a wealthy family, he travelled to [[Europe]] several times. Of the generation of 1922, Oswald de Andrade best represents the rebellious characteristics of the modernist movement. He is the author of the ''Manifesto Antropófago ([[Cannibal Manifesto]])'' (1927), in which he says it is necessary that Brazil, like a [[cannibalism|cannibal]], eat foreign culture and, in [[digestion]], create its own culture.

===30s generation===
After the modernist critique there was a generation of writers which actually "regressed" in terms of "modernist" ideas of experimentation, and which instead focused on social criticism. In literary criticism however they are mostly regarded as a development within modernism and grouped within the term "Geração de 30"(30s generation).

[[Jorge Amado]], one of best-known of modern Brazilian writers, tried with his novels to approximate his works to a [[proletarian literature]], he himself was a member of the communist party which defended [[Socialist realism]] at the time.

[[Rachel de Queiroz]], and [[José Lins do Rego]] were other important writers of this generation.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Post-Modernism ==
What defined Brazilian modernism were two main traits: experiments in language and an enhanced social consciousness, or a mix between the two - as was the case with Oswald de Andrade, who was briefly attracted towards the [[communist]] movement. The reaction to modernism, then, assumed the form of a mix between its most salient trait, the use of more formal literary language (as was the case of the so-called "generation of 1945", whose twin hallmarks were, firstly, the highly physical poetry of [[João Cabral de Melo Neto]], who opposed [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]]'s poetic modernism, and secondly the [[sonnets]] - on both the Italian and English model - of the early [[Vinicius de Moraes]]), followed by varying doses, according to the author considered, of subjectivism, political conservatism and militant Catholicism.

Two writers from that "school" that have published after the 1950s are without a doubt already inside the canon of Brazilian literature: [[Clarice Lispector]], whose existentialist novels and short stories are filled with stream-of-consciousness and epiphanies, and [[João Guimarães Rosa]], whose experimental language has changed the face of Brazilian literature forever. His novel ''[[Grande Sertão: Veredas]]'' has been compared to [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' or [[Alfred Döblin]]'s ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'' and featured in the [[Bokklubben World Library]] list of 100 best novels of all time. [[João Guimarães Rosa]] is considered by many to be the greatest Brazilian writer.

Following the wake of conservative subjectivism inaugurated by the militantly Catholic novelists-cum-polemicists [[Octavio de Faria]], [[Lúcio Cardoso]], [[Cornélio Penna]] and [[Gustavo Corção]], [[Nelson Rodrigues]] made his career as a playwright and sports journalist. His plays and short stories - the latter mostly originally published as newspaper ''[[feuilleton]]s'' - chronicled the social mores of the 1950s and 1960s; adultery and sexual pathologies in general being a major fixation of his. His sports writing describes the evolution of [[Football (soccer)|football]] into the national passion of Brazil. He was heavily critical of the young leftists who opposed the military dictatorship after the [[Brazilian Military Coup|1964 coup]]; for that he was penned as right-wing and conservative. For a time heavily pro-dictatorship, he had to suffer the tragic fate of having one of his sons being tortured and incarcerated for belonging to an underground guerrilla organization.&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Contemporary ==
Contemporary Brazilian literature is, on the whole, very much focused on city life and all its aspects: loneliness, violence, political issues and media control. Writers like [[Rubem Fonseca]], [[Sérgio Sant'Anna]] have written important books with these themes in the 1970s, breaking new ground in Brazilian literature, up until then mostly having dealt with rural life.

New trends since the 1980s have included works by authors such as [[João Gilberto Noll]], [[Milton Hatoum]], [[Bernardo Carvalho]], [[João Almino]], [[Adriana Lisboa]] and [[Cristovão Tezza]].

Poets such as [[Ferreira Gullar]] and [[Manoel de Barros]] are among the most acclaimed within literary circles in Brazil, the former had been nominated for the [[Nobel Prize]].

In recent years, "marginal literature" has risen to prominence with authors and poets such as [[Sérgio Vaz]] and [[Ferréz]] making appearances at important events like [[Festa Literária Internacional de Paraty]], Flipside and [[Bienal do Livro de São Paulo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blyth |first=Joanna |url=http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/brazil/brazils-new-literary-encounters/ |title=Brazil’s New Literary Encounters &amp;#124; Sounds and Colours |website=Soundsandcolours.com |date=2014-09-03 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other poets such as [[:pt:Adélia Prado|Adélia Prado]], [[:pt:Elisa Lucinda|Elisa Lucinda]], [[Luis Alexandre Ribeiro Branco]], are among the contemporary poets.

'''''Chori Chori Chupke Chupke''''' (English: ''Secretly and Stealthily'') is a [[Bollywood films of 2001|2001]] Indian [[Hindi-language]] [[romantic drama film]] directed by [[Abbas Burmawalla|Abbas]]-[[Mustan Burmawalla|Mustan]]. It stars [[Salman Khan]], [[Rani Mukerji]] and [[Preity Zinta]] in leading roles. The music is composed by [[Anu Malik]] and the lyrics are penned by [[Sameer]]. It emerged as a commercial success and was one of the highest-grossing films of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/hit-down.php?txtYearlyData=2000-2009&amp;year=2001 | title=Top Hits 2001 | work=[[Box Office India]] | date=14 November 2016 | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film generated heavy controversy during its release because it was one of the first Bollywood films to handle the [[taboo]] issue of [[surrogate mother|surrogate childbirth]].

This is the only movie of director duo [[Abbas-Mustan]] in which Salman Khan worked. Earlier they approached him for the 1993 movie ''[[Baazigar]]''. However, the role was later offered to [[Shahrukh Khan]]. 
Some of the scenes in the film have been borrowed from ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990), and the storyline is similar to 1980 movie ''[[Avan Aval Adhu]]'' and the 1983 movie ''[[Doosri Dulhan]]'' by [[Lekh Tandon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2001/03/25/stories/14252183.htm | title=Double trouble all the way | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=25 March 2001 | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the CBI ([[Central Bureau of Investigation]]) seized prints of ''Chori Chori Chupke Chupke'', after it was discovered the movie was funded by [[Chhota Shakeel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/2001/01/08/stories/0208000j.htm 0208000j.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Mumbai underworld]], which resulted in the well publicised [[Bharat Shah]] case.

== Plot ==
Raj Malhotra ([[Salman Khan]]) and Priya ([[Rani Mukerji]]) are members of high society. They meet, get married and soon afterwards Priya gets pregnant. Very early in the pregnancy, Priya trips, miscarries, and becomes permanently infertile. On the Dr. Balraj Chopra ([[Prem Chopra]])'s advice, they decide to look for a [[surrogate mother|surrogate]] mother to bear Raj's child. The surrogacy is concealed from their conservative family. Raj meets Madhubala a.k.a. Madhu ([[Preity Zinta]]), a [[prostitute]] who agrees to have Raj's baby, in exchange for money. After some much-needed behavioural grooming and an image make over, Madhu meets Priya — who will be left unaware that Madhu is a prostitute—and the three depart for [[Switzerland]] together to carry out their plan.

Soon Madhu is [[pregnant]] with Raj and Priya's child, and he happily tells his family that Priya is expecting. Meanwhile, Raj's business partner Ajay Sharma ([[Adi Irani]]) has begun sexually harassing Madhu until she is ready to leave Switzerland, upset at the thought that Raj told his friend that she is a prostitute, although he didn't. Eventually, Priya finds out about Madhu's past, but she still believes that Madhu should carry their child, and she begs her to stay. Finally, Raj's friend assaults Madhu while he thinks she's home alone, but Raj saves Madhu. Overwhelmed by Raj's kindness, Madhu falls in love with Raj.

Raj's family suddenly arrives in [[Switzerland]]. While Priya reaches for pregnancy-simulating pillows, the family meet the heavily pregnant Madhu and Raj tells them that she is a friend who is staying with him and Priya while her husband is business-traveling and she has no other family.  Raj's grandfather Kailashnath Malhotra ([[Amrish Puri]]) and father Ranjit Malhotra ([[Dalip Tahil]]) arrange a religious ceremony and tell Raj and Priya that they are going back to [[India]]; this also includes Madhu.

The ceremony is very important so Priya sends Madhu as herself. The emotion at the ceremony is too much for Madhu and she becomes conflicted about giving up her child. Priya finds Madhu's room empty and the money dumped on the bed, and pursues her to the train station, only to slap Madhu when she confesses that she loves Raj. By the time Raj gets there, Madhu has gone into premature labor. The [[Physician|doctor]] announces that only one—Madhu or her child—can be saved, and Priya asks him to save Madhu. However, both mother and baby survive and seem likely to thrive. Madhu gives the baby to Priya, who quickly settles into a hospital bed with "her" baby. The doctor tells Raj's family that Madhu's child was stillborn and Madhu has made a recovery.

When Madhu is ready to leave, she promises Raj that she won't go back to prostitution. When he takes her to the airport he realizes that she loves him and kisses her forehead. Madhu leaves happily.

== Critical reception ==
The film met with mostly mixed-positive reviews, with critics praising the uniqueness of the film which dealt with a previously untouched subject. [[Preity Zinta]]'s performance in a meaty, unconventional role was especially noted by many critics alike. However, the duo of [[Salman Khan]] and [[Rani Mukerji]] faced criticism, with reviews expressing that they were nothing more but beauty fillers in the film. Film critic Sukanya Verma found Mukerji to be "handicapped with a role that doesn't give her much scope besides weeping and sobbing" and stated Khan's performance lacked substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Verma, Sukanya|title=Preity Trite|date=9 March 2001|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2001/mar/09cccc.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Arami has memory, his mother suffers from epilepsy and [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson]]'s. As the only daughter of an absent father, Arami had to take responsibility for herself and her mother from an early age. For some years she has been trying to build her own happiness in Switzerland, where she lives with her partner Patrick. Her mother continues to live in Paraguay with Julia, a caregiver without adequate preparation for the task, who takes care of her throughout the day in exchange for a modest salary.

However, her mother's health is deteriorating more and more. Julia can no longer cope with the situation and wants to quit her job. Since no one except Arami can take care of her mother, she must return to Paraguay. Will he be able to find a solution to his mother's situation, in a country where the care of the elderly is left mainly in the hands of their relatives? Should he give up his own life in Europe and return to his mother?

The '''Constitution House of Tabriz''', also known as '''''Khaneh Mashrouteh''''', is a historical edifice located next to the Great [[Bazaar of Tabriz]], on Motahari Ave in [[Tabriz]], [[Iran]]. During the years which led to [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution]] and afterwards the house was used as a gathering place of the leaders, activists and sympathizers of the movement. Among them, the most famous people were [[Sattar khan]], [[Bagher Khan]], [[Seqat-ol-Eslam Tabrizi]] and [[Haji Mirza Aqa Farshi]] and the founder [[Haji Mehdi Kuzeh kanaani]], himself a revolutionary activist and a well-reputed person of the time; who was named [[Abolmele]], i.e. the father of the nation at the time. The two-story building was constructed in 1868 by [[Haj Vali Me'mar-e Tabrizi]][http://www.irantour.org/Iran/city/TABRIZ.html]. It has numerous rooms and halls. The most beautiful part of the house is a skylight and corridor decorated with colorful glass and mirrors.

==History==
The house was constructed by order of [[Haj Mehdi Koozekonani]] in 1868. It includes a two-floor building with internal and external areas featuring [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] period architecture. Haj Mehdi Koozekonani was a merchant in the [[Bazaar of Tabriz]]. With initiating of Constitution revolution and rising up in Tabriz city, Haj Mehdi joined the revolution and became one of the major financier of the revolution. At the same time he used the house as a place for meeting of the revolution heads, and a place for publication of underground paper of the constitution movement. The house became important in the history once again just after World War II, when it was used a place for Azerbaijan's Democrat Party meeting center (1946–1947). In 1975 the house is registered by Cultural Heritage of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jadidonline.com/story/15012010/frnk/mashrouteh_house&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum contents==
The first floor is an exhibition of sculptures of famous Iranian constitution revolutionaries and some of their personal belongings, including their weapons, underground published newspaper of the revolution, [[night letters]], the printing machine which was used in the house to publish revolution papers, and numerous photos from the revolution. One of the rooms in the building belongs to the woman's role in the revolution.

==Location==
The Constitutional House of [[Tabriz]] is located in Rasteh Koocheh Street in front of [[Jamee Mosque]] of [[Tabriz]].

[[Andy Warhol]]'s '''''Cow Wallpaper''''' was the first in a series of wallpaper designs he created from the 1960s to the 1980s.

According to Warhol, the inspiration for the cow image came from art dealer [[Ivan Karp]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Another time he said, 'Why don't you paint some cows, they're so wonderfully pastoral and such a durable image in the history of the arts.' (Ivan talked like this.) I don't know how 'pastoral' he expected me to make them, but when he saw the huge cow heads — bright pink on a bright yellow background — that I was going to have made into rolls of wallpaper, he was shocked. But after a moment he exploded with: 'They're ''super''-pastoral! They're ridiculous! They're blazingly bright and vulgar!' I mean, he loved those cows and for my next show we papered all the walls in the gallery with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warhol |first1=Andy |last2=Hackett|first2=Pat|title=POPism: The Warhol 60s |date=1980|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=9780151730957|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtI3AQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The show Warhol refers to is his April, 1966 show at the [[Leo_Castelli#Leo_Castelli_Gallery|Leo Castelli Gallery]], which consisted only of ''Cow Wallpaper'' in one room, and a second room with Warhol's silver helium-filled ''Clouds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andy Warhol|url=https://www.castelligallery.com/artists/Warhol/warhol.html|website=Castelli Gallery|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian and critic [[Barbara Rose]] interpreted ''Cow Wallpaper'' as a commentary on the nature of art collecting and the character of the institutions where art is displayed.  In a review of Warhol's 1971 retrospective show at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney]], she observed that cows are a common subject of [[Genre painting|genre paintings]] that people display in their homes, and that the wallpaper made the Whitney look like "a boutique." She continued, "Of course the museum has been a boutique for a long time, and people have been treating paintings like wallpaper even longer. But Andy spells it out with his usual cruel clarity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rose|first1=Barbara|title=In Andy Warhol's Aluminum Foil, We Have All Been Reflected|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ij-_4jJ4oj8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|work=New York Magazine|date=31 May 1971|page=55|issn=0028-7369|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Defensor minor''''' is a work by [[Marsilius of Padua]] written around 1342. The Defensor minor is a restatement and defense of Marsilius's best known work, the ''[[Defensor pacis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nederman, Cary J. [http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521408466 Marsiglio of Padua: 'Defensor minor' and 'De translatione imperii']&lt;/ref&gt; 

The text discusses civil and [[ecclesiastical]] jurisdiction, the [[Confession (religion)|confession]], [[penance]], [[indulgence]]s, the [[Crusades]], [[pilgrimage]]s, [[plenitudo potestatis]], legislative power, the origin of the sovereignty, [[wedding]], and [[divorce]].

==Civil jurisdiction==
With regard to jurisdiction, Marsilius distinguishes between divine and human laws, the first event which is independent of any human will and on the conduct of man in view of the afterlife, the second which determines the will of the people, endowed with coercive power and not modifiable by any clergyman.

This applies also to the Pope that even with his decrees may waive the law, manifestation of the people's sovereignty. While the beneficiaries of the two laws are identical, its object and purpose are different. The one seeks the good of the soul and the other cares for earthly well-being, with the result that the church is denied the power to make laws, even in the persistent silence of human legislation. The same applies to amendments and changes, which should remain solely with the people. The only thing that is relevant to the clergy is the non-legal rules that affect morality and resolve themselves into simple counsels and take effect with counsellors.

==The clergy==
The task and the main function of the clergy is to teach the sacred texts and preparing souls for the afterlife. The Church has repeatedly stated that for the sinner there is no other system of redemption from sin but confession. Marsilius, in an effort to bring man to God, regardless of any broker, says that confession should be done directly to God and that salvation comes only by true repentance. This anticipates what will be one of the tenets of Protestantism. The necessity of this Sacrament, that is only recommended and not required, is not detected from the Holy Scriptures. Only sincere repentance to the outside of any denominational gives you that peace in the soul that is the prelude of eternal salvation.  Absolution from sin belongs only to God and the priest, who may do so, does so only within the Church. ''Sufficit soli Deo confiteri peccata ipsa, videlicet recognoscendo, et de ipsis poenitendo cum proposito talia alterius non committendi.'' 
These words can be regarded as harbingers of what will be the principles of the Lutheran Reformation.

''Sufficit sola contritio et vera poenitentia de commisso absque omni confessione facta vel fienda sacerdoti, ut immediate absolvatur per Deum.'' Marsilio does not exclude absolutely confession: he says only that it is useful but not essential,  which it would be if it were a precept, therefore  he also denies the priestly power to inflict penalties.
Only contrition frees from sin not repentance of any material or spiritual character almost like a compensation for the sin.''Quamvis in hoc saeculo nullam realem aut personalem satisfactionem exhibeat pro peccatis.''

==Plot==

{{Plot|date=July 2012}}
Anora Fleece (Laura Harring) who had dreams of a fairy tale marriage with her husband Cheb (Oded Fehr), discovers that reality is harsh, finding her only solace in daydreams. Cheb becomes sullen, abusive &amp; disrespectful toward her. Her two children, Tabby &amp; Little Pete (Ashley Duggan Smith, Christopher Newhouse) adopt similar attitudes toward her. When soft-spoken Anora meets with her new neighbor Imogene Cochran ([[Jill Marie Jones]]), the bright bubbly woman offers exciting new perspective on life.

However, little Pete's reaction to Imogene is less than favorable; Anora slaps Pete in the face for regarding her new friend as a "nigger." Little Pete threatens to inform their racist father that Anora had allowed a black woman to their home. At supper, little Pete acts as promised and tells Cheb about Imogene. Cheb breaks a beer bottle in a fit of rage and threatens Anora. Anora is hesitant to continue seeing her new friend, but decides to go ahead with it.

As the two women become more than friends, Tabby has been in a mess all her own. Having met and complied to have oral sex behind a bush with teenager Denny (Dalton Alfortish), they form a relationship. Tabby is infatuated with Denny. She mentioned this to her best friend, Princess (Rebecca Newman), who leads her to feel ashamed and insists Denny is trash. Tabby later breaks up her relationship with Denny, who insulted her by calling Tabby "an unfeeling emo scene bitch." Later Tabby discovers him receiving oral sex from Princess, and leaves school. Seething with betrayal &amp; frustration, Tabby is driven further into rebellious, sullen, and disrespectful moods. She often takes this out on Anora. Pete gets an A+ on his exam and we briefly view a fantasy he has of his male teacher. He bumps into Tabby cutting class during his football practice and they leave together.

The audience is shown Cheb at his day job in the factory, and in a meeting with his boss we are in no subtle way led to infer that Cheb must give his boss oral sex to maintain his job. Cheb leaves from work early after becoming sick. When Cheb arrives home, angry, he discovers Anora and Imogene lip-locked in his room. In yet another fit of fury, Cheb produces a gun. Pete and Tabby come home and, alerted by the sound of struggle, watch in shock. In Anora's struggle to disarm him, Cheb shoots Little Pete near the head. Anora lets out a terrible scream snatches away the gun; she shoots Cheb five times and kills him as Imogene and Tabby gawk in horror.

After making sure that Little Pete (protected by his football gear) is okay, they decide to leave town. Tabby grows even more disrespectful against Anora and Imogene, siding more with her deceased father. She secretly cries and draws a scribble of Tabby punching &amp; strangling Princess for a bitter betrayal in spite of the death of her father. The next morning, after Tabby has a brief confrontation with Imogene about alerting the police, the altered family sets out on a trip, with Cheb's body on the trunk. They make a quick stop at a park that Tabby insists on saying goodbye to a strange rubber relic "Gully", and the journey begins.

They make a hotel stop for the night. When Anora leaves to buy food, a police officer pulls her over, believing that she is seling Kathy K make-up. Relieved, she provides him with a catalog. Anora returns with sandwiches, and Tabby throws a tantrum because she doesn't like her sandwich. Anora offers to take hers instead, but Tabby continues her fit and calls Anora useless amongst other things. Imogene confronts Tabby about talking to Anora so rudely. Tabby curses everyone in the room, angrily walks out, stealing away to sleep in Imogene's car for the night.

Anora sees Tabby's scribble about her killing Cheb, allowing her to see her daughter's anger. In Imogene's car, Tabby begins to cry, as she still misses her father, holding Anora, and partially Imogene, responsible for intentionally murdering Cheb.

The next day, the gang continues on the road. Tabby and Imogene still have issues with each other. Imogene accidentally runs over a squirrel, Tabby and Pete insist on having a burial for the squirrel.

As the gang arrives at Kathy K's house (Ruthie Austin), excited to see Imogene, she introduced everyone to her. It turns out that kathy k has killed many of her husbands and has a back yard full of their graves/corpses. After a warm welcome, Tabby and Pete spy two of Kathy K's male workers kissing each other. Tabby says "That's so sick", but Pete grins in fascination. Kathy questions Anora about shooting Cheb, as she was so shy to talk about it. Tabby &amp; Pete looked at Cheb's corpse, disgusted by the look, as they both paid their respects as they were sorry for his death.

Later, Anora, alone with Imogene, begins to kiss her bare shoulder, cheek, corner of her mouth, when they were suddenly interrupted by Tabby &amp; Pete entering the room. Tabby has an emotional breakdown, Pete was surprised &amp; shocked in confusion. Tabby describes that it was so gross and disgusting and that she hates homosexuality. Pete asks Anora if she and Imogene are normal, but Tabby interrupts, describing them as totally fucked up. Pete insulted Tabby by calling her a "slut". Tabby makes the mistake of calling Imogene the word "nigger", met with one of Anora's forceful slaps. Tabby guesses that the reason Cheb had his gun out in the first place was because she and Imogene had been together and Anora confirms it.

Anora and Pete talk about how Cheb had been abusive and had hit both of them on several accounts. While Tabby says that Cheb never hit her, she eventually reveals that once she went with Cheb to a bar and, after a few too many drinks, one of his friends tried to molest her in her father's plain sight. She threw up on his face and was humiliated, yet Cheb only laughed. She kept it as a dark memory from Anora.

The three decide to go along with Imogene &amp; Kathy K to the beach. The adults happily watch Tabby &amp; Pete play with each other in the water. They return to Kathy K's and bond while applying makeup together. Tabby and  Pete announced that they are ready to bury Cheb. They do his funeral makeup and bury Cheb, looking like a fabulous drag queen amongst Kathy K's various backyard graves.

The gang has a peaceful dinner. Anora, Tabby, &amp; Pete, on the pool staring at the sky, wished for a miracle that had come true. Anora and Imogene, alone at last, can finally enjoy each other fully, as the final scene of the movie ends with Tabby's final diary entry to tell Gully to forget about what she said about Anora &amp; Imogene, she tells Cheb to take care, she says, "Without him, we wouldn't have set loose &amp; ended up living ", Tabby says amen, and quietly closes her diary.

'''Fiz Stape''' (also '''Brown''')  is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Coronation Street]]''. Portrayed by [[Jennie McAlpine]], the character first appeared on screen on 20 April 2001. Initially appearing for five episodes, McAlpine's contract was soon extended and Fiz became a regular character. In May 2014, it was announced that McAlpine was expecting her first child and Fiz temporarily departed on 14 November 2014, returning on 19 June 2015. In November 2017, McAlpine took a break from filming to take part in the 17th series of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] reality show ''[[I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'' and her exit aired on 18 December 2017, she returned on 2 March 2018. In April 2018, McAlpine announced that she is expecting her second child and will take maternity leave from the show in December 2018 and will return in 2019.

Fiz initially appeared as a troubled teenager briefly fostered by [[Roy Cropper|Roy]] ([[David Neilson]]) and [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) at the age of 15. She later started working at the Underworld factory. Fiz was involved in a murder storyline in which her husband [[John Stape]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]), committed three [[murder]]s and had Fiz help him bury the bodies. She had to implicate other people in order to cover for John. She gave birth to her daughter [[Hope Stape|Hope]] [[Preterm birth|prematurely]], in the [[Coronation Street Live (2010)|live 50th anniversary episode]] with McAlpine becoming the first actress to act out a birth live on a soap opera.

==Storylines==
Fiz's first appearance was as a troubled sixteen-year-old fostered by [[Roy Cropper|Roy]] ([[David Neilson]]) and [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]). Her boisterous attitude clashes with the pair and Roy gets angry with her when she starts a small fire in the flat while cooking chips. Fiz claims Roy hit her; the claim is quickly dismissed and Fiz is sent to another foster family. Fiz reappears a few months later, having dropped out of school, and gets a job as a machinist at [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) factory. She is initially dismissive of Roy and Hayley, but when Hayley is held on remand for kidnapping Wayne Hayes (Gary Damer), a boy the Croppers were trying to save from his abusive stepfather, she changes her mind, recognising the Croppers are the only parental figures who truly cared for her, and takes it upon herself to look after Roy in Hayley's absence.

Fiz made her interest in [[Tyrone Dobbs]] ([[Alan Halsall]]) clear, kissing him. When his fiancé, [[Maria Connor|Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]), found out, she broke up with him, and Tyrone and Fiz became a couple. When [[Terry Duckworth]] ([[Nigel Pivaro]]), the son of Tyrone's surrogate parents [[Jack Duckworth|Jack]] ([[Bill Tarmey]]) and [[Vera Duckworth|Vera]] ([[Elizabeth Dawn]]), is arrested on a false assault charge after coming out of hiding to take Jack to hospital, Fiz sells the story to the newspapers. The Duckworths are initially angry but it results in a witness coming forward to clear Terry. Fiz convinces Mike to use some designs she has done at the factory but she has accidentally plagiarised other designers and Mike sacks her. She stages a topless protest on the roof of the factory which gets her her job back but sees Tyrone break up with her.

Fiz is nearly arrested on a trip to [[Blackpool]] with Tyrone, [[Kirk Sutherland]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]) and [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]), since unknown to the others Kirk has broken into the caravan they are using. When Maria leaves town, Fiz moves into her old room in the flat above the salon, sharing with [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]), who soon becomes a close friend. She sleeps with Kirk but believes he would not be interested in a relationship; Toyah manages to convince the pair to become a couple. Maria returns and is unhappy to find herself not only sharing with Fiz but with Kirk in regular attendance. Fiz is caught in the middle when Maria becomes pregnant by Toyah's boyfriend John Arnley (Paul Warriner) and supports her when she has an abortion. Toyah leaves town not long afterwards, after saying a fond farewell to Fiz. Fiz subsequently finds herself called on to play agony aunt to a succession of unlucky in love flatmates: Maria, [[Candice Stowe]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]) and [[Claire Peacock|Claire Casey]] ([[Julia Haworth]]).

Fiz becomes friends with Kirk's housemate [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]) and is one of the few people to believe he is innocent of assaulting corrupt policeman Mick Hopwood (Ian Gain). Les introduces Fiz and Kirk to his new girlfriend, who turns out to be Fiz's mother [[Cilla Battersby-Brown|Cilla]] ([[Wendi Peters]]). Fiz learns Cilla has left her younger brother [[Chesney Brown|Chesney]] ([[Sam Aston]]) home alone and Les brings him to live on the street. When Fiz and Kirk break up, Tyrone declares his interest again. Fiz and Tyrone sleep together but are interrupted by Tyrone serenading her with "[[The Real Slim Shady]]". Both Kirk and Tyrone propose: Tyrone hires a horse to do so on horseback, while Kirk steals an expensive ring from a jeweller's. When Fiz finds out, she enlists Tyrone to return the ring secretly and Kirk is let off with a caution. Despite not getting engaged, Fiz reunites with Kirk.

Kirk's parents emigrate and sign their kennel business over to him. He and Fiz move into the adjacent house but Fiz is not happy looking after dogs and soon moves out. Kirk instead employs [[Molly Dobbs|Molly Compton]] ([[Vicky Binns]]), a girl Fiz bullied at school to cope with being bullied herself. Molly considers taking Kirk off Fiz as payback but ends up dating Tyrone instead. When first Cilla and then Les leave the area, Fiz moves into No. 5 with Kirk and Chesney. Eventually Fiz is reacquainted with her first boyfriend, [[John Stape]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]), who is now working at Weatherfield High School. Fiz leaves Kirk, declining his proposal of marriage, and starts dating John, moving back into the salon flat withhim.

When John begins an affair with student, [[Rosie Webster]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]), Fiz thinks he is having an affair with Rosie's mother, [[Sally Webster|Sally]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]), whom he has been teaching. However, the truth is revealed on Christmas Day 2007, when John inadvertently mixes up Fiz and Rosie's presents. When Fiz returns, she is shocked to learn what has happened but bravely decides to move on with her life and applies to be Chesney's guardian. Chesney and his beloved [[Great Dane]], Schmeichel are allowed to return home after Fiz moves into No. 5. Initially, she clashes with Kirk's girlfriend, [[Julie Carp]] ([[Katy Cavanagh]]). While she is happy that Kirk has moved on, she is unhappy with Julie's attempts to be Chesney's carer, feeling that it is her job. After a few months, they become friends.

Fiz receives numerous unknown phone calls. She discovers that it is ex-boyfriend, John, seeking a reconciliation, but declines his requests. He takes a job with ''StreetCars'' so he can be close to her, and buys Chesney a bike for his birthday. Fiz and John become friends again and she soon agrees to give him another chance. However, Fiz ends things when she realises that he wants them to move into his grandmother's house in the countryside. Fiz becomes worried when he constantly claims that he has to go to his grandmother's house to 'feed the cat' and eventually discovers that he is holding Rosie hostage there, supposedly for ruining his relationship with Fiz. Fiz releases Rosie, and John is arrested for kidnap and false imprisonment. John continues to send Fiz cards and letters while he is on remand, and is eventually sentenced to 2 years in prison. Soon after John's kidnapping of Rosie is revealed, Fiz receives some bad news about Chesney. He and Kirk are visiting Cilla in South Africa (their adventures are shown in ''Coronation Street: Out of Africa'') and Cilla tells Fiz that Chesney has been in an accident. When Fiz arrives, she is very upset to see Chesney in a wheelchair. She is relieved, yet angry, when they tell her that it is a scam to win a Sunshine Families competition with a £500,000 prize. Fiz later returns to Weatherfield.

Fiz decides that she still loves John and wants to marry him. She proposes to him by writing a message so that she is allowed into the prison, after talking about him being on [[suicide]] watch. Fiz is allowed to see John briefly and as he is led away, Fiz asks him if he will marry her. John instantly agrees. John later sends Fiz his grandmother's engagement ring and a visiting order. She sees him and he places the engagement ring on her finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a163590/john-gives-fiz-an-engagement-ring.html|title=Coronation Street - Spoiler - John gives Fiz an engagement ring|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Kris Green|date=13 July 2009|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiz and John marry on 28 September 2009. The wedding is held in the prison chapel but Fiz cannot go through with the ceremony without Chesney's support, revealing that all of their friends and neighbours are against the marriage. John does his best to persuade Fiz to go ahead regardless but she refuses, walking out and collapsing in tears outside the prison. Just as it seems that Fiz's big day is doomed, Chesney arrives with Roy and Hayley. He apologises to Fiz and he is there when Fiz and John marry.

Fiz is shocked to hear of the letters that John has written to the Street residents, informing them that he will soon be released and asks for their backing to live there with Fiz. The street is split down the middle: for instance, the Croppers agree, but [[Eddie Windass]] ([[Steve Huison]]) (despite never having met John and baked his and Fiz's wedding cake) is against it. When Sally learns of the letters, she is left fuming and angrily organises a protest meeting in The Rovers for that evening. At the meeting, Sally gives a speech against John, wanting residents to write back and refuse his request, which [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) completely backs. However, Roy fights John's corner, with [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]) pointing out that John is entitled to live wherever he wants and [[Graeme Proctor]] ([[Craig Gazey]]) outright supports him, to the disgust of [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]). As [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]) expresses his neutralness, Fiz gives an impassioned speech about how John is sorry and wants to set things right, pointing out how Sally and Rosie have been compensated for John's actions. Fiz's speech is applauded by the majority of residents, much to the disgust of Sally and Dev. The residents all write back, with the overwhelming majority agreeing to let him return to Weatherfield. In mid-November, John is released.

Sally, furious that John has moved back to the street, paints the windows of No. 5 black during the night. Fiz, furious, wants to phone the police - particularly after Sally admits what she has done in front of witnesses - but John refuses. He and Fiz spend the day scraping the paint off and accept Graeme's help in repainting the upstairs of the house to match. Rosie does not seem to care that he is living across the street until, swindled out of her compensation by [[Luke Strong (Coronation Street)|Luke Strong]] ([[Craig Kelly (actor)|Craig Kelly]]), the acting owner of Underworld whom she had been having a fling with, she tells John that she has decided to return to college and study to be a doctor. She asks him for £50,000 to fund this and is stunned when he refuses so she tries blackmailing him, claiming that he had grabbed her and locked her in ''Roy's Rolls'', where he is now working. Sally and Kevin call the police and John is arrested but released pending further inquiries. That night in the pub, he challenges Rosie about her version of events and, when unable to answer his questions, she reveals that she has lied. Furious, Kevin orders her to apologise the next day and withdraw her statement to the police. Sally also apologises to John and Fiz and asks them not to press charges. John agrees but Fiz is openly angry. The Stapes and the Websters both agree to stay out of each other's way.

John meets one of his ex-teacher colleagues, [[Colin Fishwick]] ([[David Crellin]]), in the café, who invites him and Fiz to his leaving party before he emigrates to [[Canada]]. Whilst at the party, Colin makes it clear to John that he wants to stop teaching.  John thinks up a plan to start teaching again himself, by stealing Colin's identity as he has a clean CRB. Fiz is initially incredulous when John tells her about his plans but, because she loves John, she soon weakens and agrees to go along with his plan. They both agree to keep the truth from Chesney, who has not been particularly fond of John since his affair with Rosie. Eventually, Fiz sees what risk John is taking and they begin to row. Fiz later leaves to go on holiday, alone. Fiz returns from her holiday and announces that she is 12 weeks pregnant with their first child. The couple make up and John promises to never lie to her again. Fiz goes into labour only six months into her pregnancy following injury in the explosion of [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]) and [[Leanne Battersby]]'s ([[Jane Danson]]) bar, The Joinery, so she is sent to hospital and gives birth to a baby girl, whom she names Hope. Straight after her birth, Hope is transferred into an incubator as she is three months premature. Due to her prematurity, her immune system is failing and is diagnosed with an infection. Fiz is told that Hope will need a transfusion in order to fight the infection. John has a breakdown following his involvement in three deaths, unbeknownst to Fiz. Fiz is left at home alone with baby Hope, who has now been allowed to leave the hospital. [[Joy Fishwick]] ([[Doreen Mantle]]), Colin's mother, asked her solicitor to track down her son before her death, and "Colin" is tracked at Number 5. Horrified, Fiz forces herself to pretend to be Mrs Fishwick. The solicitor informs Fiz of Joy's death and that she has left her fortune to Colin. John returns home in March 2011 and things seem to look up, but John realises all of the new things that Fiz has bought, which she dishonestly explains are from money she received when the factory girls had a whip-round for her. In April 2011, John decides to stop taking his medication, despite [[Matt Carter (Coronation Street)|Dr. Matt Carter]]'s ([[Oliver Mellor]]) objection. Joy's solicitor turns up at No. 5, with Fiz having to pose as Mrs Fishwick again. The solicitor reveals that Joy's house had been sold and the money is to be transferred into Fiz's (i.e. Mrs Fishwick's) bank account. John is furious with Fiz for what she has done, thinking it is all over for him. John suffers another breakdown, locking himself in the bookies, after which he runs away. [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) and Dr. Carter suggest that they call the police, but Fiz, knowing the potential imprisonment of both she and John, decides to wait and see if he returns.

The police arrive at Fiz's home to notify herself and Chesney that John had been caught on CCTV boarding a ferry at [[Holyhead]]. Eventually, Fiz confesses her role in the crime and so the police arrest Fiz for Colin's murder. At the police station, Fiz is interviewed for the murder. She is taken into custody but is released and then attends [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]]. The incident is deemed too serious, so she is sent to [[Crown Court]]. Fiz is charged with three murders after John flees the country to [[Ireland]]. Fiz is remanded in custody and faces trial at Crown court. Fiz is denied bail and is sent straight to prison to await trial. Fiz struggles with life in prison, and struggles to cope without Hope, who has been left in the care of Roy and Hayley. She is offered a place in the Mother and Baby unit, but refuses as she feels it is no place to bring her baby up. She becomes even more distressed when she is forced to do some cleaning in the mother and baby unit, as seeing other mums with their babies upsets her and reminds her of her daughter. Fiz soon changes her mind and requests a place in the unit, but is forced to wait. Horrified when she finds her cellmate, [[Ginny Portis]] (Ashley McGuire), unconscious from a [[drug overdose]], Fiz is shocked to discover that her friend [[List of Coronation Street characters (2011)#Ruth Walsh|Ruth Walsh]] ([[Rebecca Callard]]) has supplied the drugs. When Fiz plans to reveal Ruth's drug supply to the governor, Ruth threatens to make her life a misery. Fiz eventually gets a place in the mother and baby unit, but is beaten up by Ruth and other girls when Ruth is removed from the unit for dealing drugs. Ruth and her friends continue to torment Fiz. After Ruth trashes her room, Fiz stands up to her and tells her to keep away from she and Hope. Upon learning the date of Fiz's trial, it is revealed to the audience that John has returned. Spotting Rosie from his car, who is trying to sell her boyfriend Jason's flat, he poses as a potential buyer named Mr Chips. He turns up at the flat and ties Rosie up, insisting that it is all her fault that he and Fiz are so miserable and trying to force her to turn up at the court and tell them that it is John who is responsible for the deaths, allowing him to release Fiz but not go to prison himself. His plan fails, however, and he has to drive away at a high speed, and crashes his car.

Fiz's trial begins and she provides her evidence, before the jury leave to consider their verdicts. Fiz is found not guilty of the murders of Joy and [[Charlotte Hoyle]] ([[Becky Hindley]]), but the jury find her guilty of Colin's murder. Fiz later learns that John has returned, but is in a critical condition in hospital after his car accident. Fiz goes to the hospital and tells John that she forgives him for everything he has done. John gives the police his statement and he then dies from his injuries. Fiz then breaks down in tears and whispers to him that he will always be "her John". Unfortunately, John was too late. Fiz is sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 15 years. Fiz and Chesney are devastated. Fiz asks Chesney to organise John's funeral. He initially refuses, but after his girlfriend, [[Katy Armstrong]] ([[Georgia May Foote]]), convinces him to, he agrees. Chesney later receives a phonecall from Fiz saying that she has been granted bail before her review. Fiz later begins a feud with [[Kirsty Soames]] ([[Natalie Gumede]]) after she nearly slices Fiz's fingers off at work using a sowing machine. When Kirsty later attacks Fiz in her own home, Fiz realises that Kirsty is beating up her fiancé Tyrone. Fiz helps Tyrone through his dilemma with Kirsty, but ends up developing feelings for him and they begin an affair. When Kirsty beats up Tyrone again, Fiz advises Tyrone to marry Kirsty so he can gain custody of his daughter [[Ruby Dobbs|Ruby]]. Kirsty accepts Tyrone's proposal, but discovers Fiz and Tyrone's affair the day before the wedding. She humiliates the pair at the church, as many of the residents watch as Kirsty reveals Fiz is Tyrone's mystery lover. During an argument at the top of the stairs, Kirsty attempts to hit Tyrone again, but ends up falling down the stairs. Fiz, [[Tommy Duckworth]] ([[Chris Fountain]]), [[Eileen Grimshaw]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]), [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]]) and [[Paul Kershaw]] ([[Tony Hirst]]) race round to the house to see what has happened, and Kirsty tells the police that Tyrone has been abusing her for months. Tyrone is arrested, which devastates Fiz. Tyrone's court hearing arrives, and Kirsty's mother [[Alison Soames|Alison]] (Dawn Hope) tries to persuade Kirsty to tell the truth, but she refuses. After Kirsty assaults Julie, Kirsty confesses to the jury that she has been beating Tyrone. Tyrone is freed and Kirsty is sent to prison.

Fiz is later distraught to hear that Hayley has been diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]]. There is further devastation when Fiz is told that Hayley's tumour is terminal, and only has six to twelve months to live. Fiz promises Hayley that she will take care of Roy after she has died. Fiz and Tyrone are present at Roy's birthday party in The Rovers on 20 September 2013, and Fiz asks Hayley and Roy whether they would like to spend more time with Hope and Ruby, which they both accept gladly. Fiz is puzzled when Hayley walks out on Roy and moves in with her and Tyrone. Unknown to Fiz, Hayley has recently told Roy that when her cancer spreads, she intends on ending her own life. While Fiz and Tyrone are at work, Hayley collapses at home and when Fiz returns, she calls for an ambulance. She accompanies Roy to the hospital and is told that Hayley has an infection. Following the incident, Hayley moves back in with Roy.

In January 2014, Fiz is devastated when she learns from [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) that Hayley has died. Fiz is unaware, however, that Hayley committed suicide after drinking a lethal cocktail. She and Tyrone rush over to the café flat, where Fiz finds Hayley's corpse on the bed with Roy's arm around her. Chesney later arrives, and he, Fiz, Tyrone, Anna and [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) all try to help Roy through his grief. A few days later, Roy is struggling to come to terms with Hayley's death, but Fiz learns that Hayley killed herself, and angrily confronts Roy and shouts at him. Anna tries to get through to Fiz that it is what Hayley wanted and that it was not assisted suicide, but Fiz only listens to Carla. On the day of Hayley's funeral, Fiz, Carla and Anna try and persuade Roy to attend, as he is refusing. He eventually attends, but in the middle of Fiz's eulogy, Roy stands up and interrupts her speech. He tells the upset residents that Hayley was the love of his life and that he will miss her dearly, which relieves Fiz, Carla and Anna, as they all thought he was going to tell them about Hayley's suicide. Following the funeral, Roy leaves Fiz and Anna a note explaining that he has gone to visit his mother [[Sylvia Goodwin]] ([[Stephanie Cole]]) for a while. The pair start to  panic, however, when a pipe bursts at the café and realize that Roy has been away for 10 days. They call Sylvia, but her sister Jean answers the phone, and explains that she hasn't heard from Roy is six months and that Sylvia is in Tenerife. Fiz calls the police, and they explain Roy's situation, without revealing Hayley's suicide. When the police leave, Fiz and Anna have many arguments about his whereabouts, as Tyrone tries to calm the bickering women down. When they get home, Fiz reveals to a stunned Tyrone that she believes that Roy is dead. In mid-February, Roy returns with no explanation of his whereabouts. He later explains that he has been stopping in a hotel by a steam museum. Fiz is later concerned when Roy doesn't come out of his flat, and that he keeps making continuous trips to the toy shop. It is revealed that he is building a model railway track, which puzzles Fiz, but fascinates Tyrone and Chesney.

In October 2014, Cilla returns to the street and reveals that she is seriously ill, suffering from [[osteoporosis]]. Although Fiz is sympathetic towards her mother, Chesney cannot forgive her for the way she treated him as a child, especially when his son, [[Joseph Brown (Coronation Street)|Joseph]] (Lucca-Owen Warwick), suffers a minor injury, whilst in her care. When Cilla reveals that she has been advised to attend a clinic in [[Wolverhampton]], so that they can help her recover, Fiz decides to go and look after her mother, leaving Hope and Ruby in Tyrone's care. On Christmas Day, Tyrone, Hope and Ruby go to stay with Fiz and Cilla for a few days and on his return, Tyrone reveals that Hope and Ruby will be staying with Fiz, for a while.

In October 2015, it is revealed Hope is suffering from a type of  [[childhood cancer]] called [[neuroblastoma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Coronation Street|title=The Doctor Has Bad News For Fiz And Tyrone - Coronation Street|date=2015-09-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhkN-nllV-4|accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; plunging Fiz and Tyrone into panic. Hope was eventually cured, but Fiz and Tyrone's insistence to provide a perfect Christmas to her in case it turned out to be her last. This later gave them financial issues.

==Creation==

Fiz initially appeared as a troubled teenager briefly fostered by [[Roy Cropper|Roy]] ([[David Neilson]]) and [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) at the age of 15. She leaves and then returns to Coronation Street, and starts work at the ''Underworld'' factory. Her name is presumably due to her distinctive afro-like hair, however she was born as Fiona. Her mother, [[Cilla Battersby-Brown|Cilla]] ([[Wendi Peters]]) and her brother, [[Chesney Brown|Chesney]] ([[Sam Aston]]) are introduced when they come to live on the street with [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]). Fiz has a bad history with her mother, who has often left her in care and never put her children first.

[[File:Fiz Brown (2001).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Fiz Brown as she appeared in 2001.]]The character first appears onscreen during the episode airing on 22 April 2001.&lt;ref name="itv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/castandcharacters/atoe/FizBrown1.html|title=Coronation Street - Cast &amp; Characters - Fiz Brown|publisher=ITV.com|author=Webmaster|year=2007|accessdate=2009-06-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607051344/http://www.itv.com/soaps/coronationstreet/castandcharacters/atoe/fizbrown1.html|archivedate=7 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The character of Fiz is a good hearted young woman who has made many puzzling decisions and is often unlucky in love.  Actress [[Jennie McAlpine]] stated that she would prefer the character to stay unlucky in love because she enjoys portraying the rowing and screaming that comes with it rather than seeing her character living happily ever after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a133801/jennie-mcalpine-fiz-brown-corrie.html|title=Jennie McAlpine (Fiz Brown, Corrie)|publisher=Digital Spy|author=Kris Green &amp; Simon Reynolds|date=28 October 2008|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiz's personality has taken some rapid transformations over the years. Starting out as a dopey teenage tearaway, she is now responsible for her younger brother, constantly trying to do the right thing by him and sometimes failing. When interviewed about this on the soap opera's official website, McAlpine stated: "I like Fiz, I think she is a good person. I know she does get it wrong sometimes, but she is just trying, she's just trying to get it all right, she doesn't always but she does try."&lt;ref name="itv"/&gt; During the same interview she then said: "Oh, Fiz has changed over the years. Luckily she's changed because I don't think I'd be here if she hadn't because she started off being a pretty, pretty bad girl actually, causing loads of trouble for Roy and Hayley."&lt;ref name="itv"/&gt;

==Development==

In November 2012, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' [[newspaper]] reported that romance will blossom for the old flames as Fiz continues to support [[Tyrone Dobbs]] ([[Alan Halsall]]) through his domestic violence ordeal with girlfriend [[Kirsty Soames]] ([[Natalie Gumede]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a435642/coronation-street-new-romance-twist-for-tyrone.html |title='Coronation Street': New romance twist for Tyrone? |publisher=Digitalspy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that Kirsty would deliberately cause injury to Fiz's hand, according to the ''[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]'', Fiz would attempt to fix her machine at the factory when it breaks only to get her hand trapped when Kirsty switches the power back on. Fiz apparently needs emergency medical attention due to the bloody injury and soon starts spreading the word that Kirsty harmed her on purpose. She is quoted as telling Tyrone: "Kirsty said she didn't do it and you might believe her, but in your head I don't think you do. What's she going to do next? She injured you and now she's injured me. Who's going to be next, Ruby?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a430217/coronation-street-kirsty-to-face-police-questioning.html#~p7EtHPYK7Xq2xI |title='Coronation Street': Kirsty to face police questioning? |publisher=Digitalspy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; McAlpine spoke about the storyline and told ''What's On TV'': "Kirsty continues to look after Fiz and stays with her while she is treated at the hospital and even returns home with her. She is quite sinister and when she finally leaves, Fiz is quite shaken by Kirsty's behaviour. Fiz has now seen how scary Kirsty can be with her own eyes. Fiz is not soft, she has spent time in prison before, but she has now seen what Tyrone has to cope with when Kirsty gets angry." She added: "Fiz really cares about Tyrone. Fiz is also very stubborn and has a sense of justice. She will probably want to see this through to the end - she wants the truth to come out. She wants Tyrone to be happy and feels this can never be the case while he is still involved with Kirsty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a436676/coronation-street-jennie-mcalpine-sinister-kirsty-will-scare-fiz.html#~p7EtzuMaW4iHXt |title='Coronation Street' Jennie McAlpine: 'Sinister Kirsty will scare Fiz' |publisher=Digitalspy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McAlpine said that her emotional scenes with Hawley (John Stape) were very draining and very hard work. She told ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'': "It's been very draining. Not emotionally, because I never take my work home with me, but genuinely physically exhausting. It's tiring having to cry continuously and I take a long time to recover from that. My face goes all red and my eyes sting for ages afterwards. I'm not a good crier!". She added: "I've always been a huge Corrie fan. Being a Northern girl it was always on in my living room. And even today, I love sitting down and catching up with what's going on. This is my dream job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=McAlpine: 'Corrie storyline is draining'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a180034/mcalpine-corrie-storyline-is-draining.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McAlpine admitted that her wedding plans caused her to receive a mixed reaction from viewers. On ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', McAlpine revealed: "It has divided the nation - some people think she's absolutely mad. But it's funny, before I proposed and did that big thing with the banner, everyone was saying, 'Oh, I think you should marry him', and now I've taken the decision into my own hands I don't think they like it now. I think people aren't happy about it now. They liked the idea but now they are worried." McAlpine added: "He didn't mean to do it for five weeks - he didn't mean to lock her up for that long, I know that. I do believe him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=McAlpine: 'Corrie plot is dividing fans'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a179493/mcalpine-corrie-plot-is-dividing-fans.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Hamburg Dramaturgy''''' ({{lang-de|Hamburgische Dramaturgie}}) is a highly influential work on [[drama]] by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], written between 1767 and 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arons|first=Wendy|last2=Baldyga|first2=Natalya|last3=Chemers|first3=Michael M.|last4=Figal|first4=Sara|date=2014-06-30|title=The "Open-Sourced" Hamburg Dramaturgy: A Twenty-first-Century Invitation to Interact with an Eighteenth-Century Work in Progress|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/548667|journal=Theatre Topics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=145–148|doi=10.1353/tt.2014.0026|issn=1086-3346}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not originally conceived as a unified and systematical book, but rather as series of essays on the theater, which Lessing wrote as commentary on the short-lived [[Hamburg National Theatre|Hamburg National Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/833404656|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing : his life, works, and thought|last=Barr)|first=Nisbet, H. B. (Hugh|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199679478|edition= 1st|location=Oxford|oclc=833404656}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection of 101 short essays represents one of the first sustained critical engagements with the potential of theater as a vehicle for the advancement of humanistic discourse. In many ways, the ''Hamburg Dramaturgy'' defined the new field of [[dramaturgy]], and also introduced the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-due.de/einladung/Vorlesungen/dramatik/lessingdra.htm|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing: Hamburgische Dramaturgie (1767)|publisher=[[University of Duisburg]]|language=German|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time Lessing wrote the ''Hamburg Dramaturgy,'' there was a new movement of German theatre, based on self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luckhurst|first1=Mary|title=Dramaturgy: A Revolution in Theatre|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors were beginning to perform the inner and outer lives of their characters at the same time. One of Lessing's most famous and renowned quotes from the compilation considers the responsibilities of the actor and the playwright: “The great discernment of the drama critic lies in his ability to distinguish, whenever he feels pleasure or displeasure, to what extent that feeling should be credited to the writer or to the actor”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcpress.media-commons.org/hamburg/notice/|title=Lessing’s Preface to the "Hamburg Dramaturgy" {{!}} Hamburg Dramaturgy {{!}} MediaCommons Press|website=mcpress.media-commons.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a journal with Lessing as a dramatic critic to reflect on the Hamburg National Theater's efforts was conceived by the theatre's founder [[Johann Friedrich Löwen]], and [[Abel Seyler]], "the power behind the throne," who at first reluctantly agreed, but was eventually won over by the journal's success.&lt;ref&gt;George Freedley, John A. Reeves, ''A history of the theatre'', Crown Publishers, 1968, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/833404656|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing : his life, works, and thought|last=Nisbet|first=H. B. (Hugh Barr)|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199679478|edition= 1st|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=833404656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the plays of the new German Bourgeoisie theatre became more detailed and complicated, the audience often felt confused or left out; Lessing’s development of the ''Hamburg Dramaturgy'' was in part a reaction to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stegemann|first1=Bernd|title=On German dramaturgy|publisher=Routledge|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics covered by Lessing in the series of essays include Aristotle's theory of tragedy, acting theory, the role of theater in society, the means by which theater achieves its emotional effects, criticism of the actor and the play, issues of translation, and a nascent theory of the psychology of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baldyga|first=Natalya|date=May 2017|title=Corporeal Eloquence and Sensate Cognition: G.

== Analysis of actors ==

The analysis of the actor, according to Lessing, is grey area for a dramaturge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcpress.media-commons.org/hamburg/essay-101-102-103-104/|title=Essay 101, 102, 103, &amp; 104 {{!}} Hamburg Dramaturgy {{!}} MediaCommons Press|last=|first=|date=|website=mcpress.media-commons.org|at=§17|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to know that with an actor's performance, the circumstances are a large factor to the performance, whereas, for example, the text itself is easier to judge because it simply involves literary analysis. When analyzing an actor's performance, current events, environment, and mentality of the actor must all be taken into account. When Lessing published his essays, numerous actors from Hamburg plays were upset with Lessing's carelessness and disregard of their talents in his essay.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Stegemann, “On German dramaturgy.” In The Routledge Companion to Dramturgy, ed. Magda Romanska (New York: Routledge, 2015), 45.

== Translations ==

In 1890, Helen Zimmern published an English translation of the text, which was re-published by Dover in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hamburg Dramaturgy|last=Lessing|first=G. E.|publisher=Dover|year=1962|isbn=|location=London|pages=|translator-last=Zimmern|translator-first=Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmern's translation omits nearly 30% of the original text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arons|first=Wendy|last2=Baldyga|first2=Natalya|last3=Chemers|first3=Michael M.|last4=Figal|first4=Sara|date=2014-06-30|title=The "Open-Sourced" Hamburg Dramaturgy: A Twenty-first-Century Invitation to Interact with an Eighteenth-Century Work in Progress|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/548667|journal=Theatre Topics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=145–148|doi=10.1353/tt.2014.0026|issn=1086-3346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translators [[Wendy Arons]] and Sara Figal, with editor Natalya Baldyga, are producing a new, complete, and fully annotated translation of the text; the essays are being [http://mcpress.media-commons.org/hamburg/ published online at MediaCommons Press] and will be published in print form by [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Routledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arons|first=Wendy|last2=Baldyga|first2=Natalya|last3=Chemers|first3=Michael M.|last4=Figal|first4=Sara|date=2014-06-30|title=The "Open-Sourced" Hamburg Dramaturgy: A Twenty-first-Century Invitation to Interact with an Eighteenth-Century Work in Progress|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/548667|journal=Theatre Topics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=145–148|doi=10.1353/tt.2014.0026|issn=1086-3346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcpress.media-commons.org/hamburg/|title=Hamburg Dramaturgy {{!}} MediaCommons Press|website=mcpress.media-commons.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessing's collection of essays are still being used as references today for the topic of dramaturgy, especially as a reference for art of theatre as an outlet for self-reflection, and how circumstances of the era during which a play was written affects how the audience perceives the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luckhurst|first1=Mary|title=Dramaturgy: A Revolution in Theatre|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hanging bowl DSCF6984.jpg|thumb|300px|Another hanging bowl from [[Sutton Hoo]]]]
[[File:FelmershamBrozeBowl.JPG|thumb|Bowl found in [[Bedfordshire]].]]

'''Hanging bowls''' are a distinctive type of artifact of the period between the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] in c. 410 AD and the emergence of the [[Christian]] [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms during the 7th century.  The surviving examples have mostly been found in Anglo-Saxon graves, but there is general agreement that they reflect [[Celtic art|Celtic traditions of decoration]].

The bowls are usually of thin beaten [[bronze]], between 15–30&amp;nbsp;cm (6-12&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter, and dished or [[cauldron]]-shaped in profile. Typically they have three decorative plates ('escutcheons') applied externally just below the rim to support hooks with rings, by which they were suspended. The ornament of these plates is often very sophisticated, and in many cases includes beautiful coloured [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] work, commonly in [[champlevé]] and using spiral motifs. Although their designs and manufacture are thought to proceed from [[Celtic art|Celtic]] technique, they are principally found in eastern Britain, and especially in the areas which received Anglo-Saxon acculturation. Their production is also evidenced in [[Pict]]ish and [[Ireland|Irish]] contexts, but they seem almost completely absent from [[Wales]], [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]].

[[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]]'s ''corpus'' gives the following breakdown of the locations in modern terms of the 174 finds he includes (many are just one or more elements of a bowl):&lt;ref&gt;Table 2, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;
:England 117, Scotland 7, Ireland 17
:Norway 26, Sweden 2, Denmark 1,
:Germany 2, Belgium 1, Netherlands 1

== Function ==
The bowls are enigmatic because their intended function is not certainly known. Many have finely-worked escutcheons set centrally within, which makes it unlikely that they could have contained opaque or sticky material such as lamp-fat. The theory that they were used as maritime [[compass]]es, with a magnetic pin floated on water within the bowl, is discounted because many have an iron band around the rim which would render this unworkable. Another opinion is that they were used for the Roman custom of mixing [[wine]] and water for service at table. Some bowls are too small to make this explanation workable if general potation were intended. However, in ritual Christian or other meals it would be possible for a group to dip bread into such a wine-bowl in imitation of the Last Supper.
[[File:12 - 000,w,150v.jpg|thumb|left|Evangelist portrait of Saint John from the 8th century Anglo-Saxon [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]]; the roundels above the columns appear to copy hanging bowl escutcheons.]]

Part of the puzzle lies in whether the bowls were normally suspended by threads from a central [[Fulcrum (mechanics)|fulcrum]] (like a lamp), or from hooks on a tripod with tall wooden legs. There is some support for the latter view, because the nearest formal parallel for such bowls from Antique contexts is in depictions of the ''[[Oracular Cortina]]'', a three-hooked bowl suspended within a tripod, over which the priestess sat when pronouncing oracles. Certainly if water were contained in the bowls it is more likely to have been for ritual or liturgical purposes than for general consumption owing to the limited capacity. This would therefore be 'special' water, perhaps consecrated for baptism or aspersion, or (in other religious circumstances) derived from a sacred source or spring. 'Tripods' are also mentioned as prizes for warriors in early literature, including the early Welsh.

== Motifs ==
Some bowls have clearly Christian motifs on their escutcheons. The spiral ornament developed through the 6th to 7th century invention of the 'trumpet-spiral' pattern, which was afterwards adopted from these enamels and incorporated into the repertoire of the famous painted Gospel-books such as the [[Book of Durrow]] or the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]. This painted decoration was certainly intended for meditative contemplation and as a devotional work. From the very mixed cultures and beliefs of the inhabitants of Britain during the Dark Ages, the art, and perhaps some part of the function of these bowls became absorbed into the Celto-Saxon ornamental language of Christian Britain. Among the finest examples is the large bowl from the [[Sutton Hoo]] ship-burial (near [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]]), which has an enameled fish sculpture set to swivel on a pin within the bowl.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/h/hanging_bowl_from_the_ship-bur.aspx British Museum] Hanging bowl from the ship-burial at Sutton Hoo.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on church plate==
The distinctive shape of the two most famous early Irish [[chalice (cup)|chalice]]s, the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and the [[Derrynaflan Chalice]] has been described as an adaptation of the hanging bowl form for a different use,&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Patrick. in Youngs, 131&lt;/ref&gt; although others see them as using shapes derived from Byzantine metalwork.

The hanging bowls have been discussed in detail by many scholars, among them [[John Romilly Allen]], [[Françoise Henry]], [[T. D. Kendrick|Sir Thomas Kendrick]], [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]], [[Hayo Vierck]], [[Jane Brenan]], and most recently in the authoritative study begun by Bruce-Mitford and completed by Sheila Raven (citation below).

'''Hybrid arts''' is a contemporary art movement in which artists work with frontier areas of science and emerging technologies.  Artists work with fields such as biology, robotics, physical sciences, experimental interface technologies (such as speech, gesture, face recognition), artificial intelligence, and information visualization.  They address the research in many ways such as undertaking new research agendas, visualizing results in new ways, or critiquing the social implications of the research.  The worldwide community has developed new kinds of art festivals, information sources, organizations, and university programs to explore these new arts.
'''Hybrid arts''' is also the name of a non profit Arts education company in the United Kingdom. Set up in 2003 after a four-year development period to create a new species of training and arts engagement provider in the cultural industries...see Hybrid:arts

==Overview/ history of the term==
Many artists are responding to the central role scientific and technological research plays in contemporary culture. They are going beyond merely using technological tools and gadgets (e.g. computers) in their work to engage deeply with the processes of research. They are creating revolutionary art at the frontiers of [[Scientific method|scientific research]]. They see art as an independent zone of research that pursues areas of science and research ignored by mainstream [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]]. They are developing technologies that would be rejected by the marketplace but are nonetheless culturally critical. They are pursuing inquiries that are seen as too controversial, too wacky, too improbable, too speculative for regular science and technology. Their theoretical orientation ranges from celebration of human curiosity to critique of science's arrogance. They enter into the processes in research at all stages: setting research agendas, development of research processes, visualization, interpretations of findings, and education of the public.

There has been some confusion over the last years of what to call this kind of art that crosses so many disciplines. It is descended from computer and [[internet art]] but reaches out to cover many new disciplines. [[Ars Electronica]], which is considered one of leading world organizations concerned with experimental arts, decided three years ago to create a new category to encompass these kinds of arts. Every year they host an international competition for artists working in these experimental fields. They decided to use the name 'Hybrid Arts'. The worldwide community of artists, theorists, and journalists interested in this art are increasingly using this term. Here is a quote from their web site that offers their definition and a preliminary list of kinds of art covered.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The “Hybrid Art” category is dedicated specifically to today’s hybrid and transdisciplinary projects and approaches to [[New media art|media art]]. Primary emphasis is on the process of fusing different media and genres into new forms of artistic expression as well as the act of transcending the boundaries between art and research, art and social/political [[activism]], art and [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Jurors will be looking very closely at how dynamically the submitted work defies classification in a single one of the Prix categories of long standing.

This category is open to all types of current works in any form:

 * Autonomic Installations and Artworks&lt;br /&gt;
 * Autonomous Sculptures&lt;br /&gt;
 * Performance and Stageprojects&lt;br /&gt;
 * Media architectures&lt;br /&gt;
 * Media based Interventions in public spaces&lt;br /&gt;
 * Mechatronics / Kinetics / Robotics&lt;br /&gt;
 * Location-based and geospatial storytelling&lt;br /&gt;
 * [[Multi-user]] environments&lt;br /&gt;
 * Annotation software tools&lt;br /&gt;
 * Artificial Life&lt;br /&gt;
 * Transgenic Art&lt;br /&gt;
 * [[Software art|Software Art]], Generative Art&lt;br /&gt;
 --- Ars Electronica Website [http://www.aec.at/prix_categories_en.php?cat=Hybrid%20Art Ars Electronica Website]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many new support systems have evolved to nurture, show, and interpret this kind of art. New educational programs have been developed. Books have been written.

==Sample of the research fields addressed in hybrid arts==
-Genetics, Bioengineering, [[stem cell]]s, proteomics &lt;br /&gt;
-Art and Biology of Living Systems: microorganisms, plants, animals, ecology&lt;br /&gt;
-Human Biology: the body, bionics, [[Body modification|body manipulation]], brain &amp; body processes, body imaging, and medicine&lt;br /&gt;
-Physical Sciences: [[particle physics]], [[atomic energy]], geology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, [[space science]], nanotechnology, [[materials science]] &lt;br /&gt;
-Kinetics, Electronics, Robotics: [[physical computing]], [[ubiquitous computing]], mixed reality&lt;br /&gt;
-Alternative Interfaces: motion, gesture, touch, [[facial expression]], speech, [[wearable computing]], [[3D audio effect|3-d sound]], and VR
-Code: algorithms, software art, genetic art, [[Artificial life|A-life]], artificial intelligence&lt;br /&gt;
-Information Systems: databases, surveillance, RFID/barcodes, synthetic cinema, information visualization&lt;br /&gt;
Telecommunications: telephone, radio, telepresence, web art, mobiles, locative media

==Festivals, shows, conferences related to hybrid arts==
Since much of the art does not fit into historical categories such as painting or sculpture, many museums and art festivals did not show the work.  Curators who were interested created new kinds of festivals, competitions, museums and shows to present the work.  Examples include Ars Electronica (note especially Interactive and Hybrid priz competitions. ISEA (International symposium of Electronic Arts), V2 - DEAF (Dutch Electronic Arts Festival), VIDA - Art &amp; Artificial Life International Competition.  Ars Electronica offers a festival each year that addresses transdisciplinary themes.Both artists and scientists are invited to speak at the conferences. Recent exhibitions focused on themes such as New Sex, Simplicity and Privacy.

==Organizations, information sources, art/science collaboration support, educational programs==
The hybrid arts community also established organizations and information sources to promote, disseminate, and interpret these new art activities. There are hundreds of such organizations of which a few examples are offered here. The external links show where to get more information.  The Journal Leonardo published by MIT Press has a 40-year history of ‘promoting and documenting work at the intersection of the arts, sciences, and technology, and… encouraging and stimulating collaboration between artists, scientists, and technologists.’ The organization also has web sites, abstract services, and collaborates with other organizations in presenting conferences.  The website  We Make Money Not Art covers media/research conferences, interviews artists/researchers, and discusses developments in various fields from activism and biology to surveillance and wearables.

Other organizations offer public events and facilitate the process of artists collaborating with researchers.  For example, [[Arts Catalyst|The Arts Catalyst]] in the UK seeks to ‘extend the practice of artists engaging with scientific processes, facilities and technologies in order to reveal and illuminate the social, political and cultural contexts that brought them into being’ through public symposia, exhibitions, and commissions.  SymbioticA in Australia is an ‘artistic laboratory dedicated to the research, learning and critique of life sciences.’ It ‘provides an opportunity for researchers to pursue curiosity-based explorations free of the demands and constraints associated with the current culture of scientific research.’ The arts lab is sponsored by the medicine department of a university.  Other examples include the Art and Genomics Centre(NL), the [[LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial]] (ES) and Artists in Labs (CH) program.

New forms of educational programs are being established at universities around the world.  Students are expected to master topics in art, media, and research disciplines. For example, the  U of Washington’s DXArts program offers a ‘creative research convergence zone for intrepid artists and scholars’ who seek to reach out beyond the arts.  The Conceptual/Information Arts (CIA) is the "experimental program within the Art Department at San Francisco State University dedicated to preparing artists and media experimentors to work at the cutting edge of science and technology".  Courses cover topics such as art &amp; biology, robotics, locative media, and physical computing.

'''Joseph Francis Ambrose''' (May 24, 1896 – May 1, 1988) was a U.S. [[World War I]] veteran who served in Company I, [[140th Infantry Regiment (United States)|140th Infantry]], [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th Division]], of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] from 1917 to 1919, becoming nationally known for his 1982 photo at the dedication day parade for the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Veterans Day photo |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:World_War_I_veteran_Joseph_Ambrose,_86,_at_the_dedication_day_parade_for_the_Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial_in_1982.jpg |website=Wikipedia |publisher=Wikimedia|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this widely viewed and circulated [[Defense Audiovisual Agency|United States Defense Audiovisual Agency]] photo, he was photographed wearing his '[[Doughboy]]' uniform, helmet, and field equipment. In the photo, Ambrose clutches the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] that had covered the casket of his son, Clement A. Ambrose, who was killed in [[Korean War|Korea]] on [[Valentine's Day]], 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hermann |first=Andrew |title=A V-Day for Viet veterans |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3770761.html |accessdate=November 12, 2015 |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=June 13, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Joseph Francis Ambrose was born May 24, 1896 in [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name="WWIDraft"&gt;{{cite web |title=World War I Draft Registration Card |url=https://www.familysearch.org/ |url-access=subscription |accessdate=November 12, 2015 |via=[[FamilySearch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father and mother were [[Austrians|Austrian]], and lived in a community of many [[Germans|German]] and Austrian immigrants.&lt;ref name="1920USFC"&gt;{{cite web |title=1920 United States Federal Census |url=http://ancestry.com |url-access=subscription |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=November 12, 2015 |via=[[Ancestry.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked at a steel mill until the age of 63. Ambrose had one sister, Anna, who lived from 1900 to 1955.

==World War I==
Ambrose was [[Conscription|drafted]] in 1917, and served in the [[United States Army]] until 1919. Prior to World War I, he was a laborer at the "Phoenix Horse Shoe Company."&lt;ref name="WWIDraft" /&gt;

==Later life and death==
After the War, in 1920, Ambrose lived with his father and sister, and was working as a "Heater" at a "Gas Company."&lt;ref name="1920USFC" /&gt; Sometime in the mid 1920s, he married a woman named Marie. Her native language was [[Croatian language|Croatian]], but she also spoke English. She was born in 1904, and immigrated to the U.S. in 1907 from [[Austria-Hungary]]. They had four sons: Joseph Jr. (1926), Norbert (1927), Clement (1928), and Rolland (1933).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1940 United States Federal Census |url=http://ancestry.com |url-access=subscription |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=November 12, 2015 |via=[[Ancestry.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Ambrose worked in the tile business and in 1942, on his World War II draft registration card, he listed "E. I. Du Pont Construction" as his employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II Draft Registration Card |url=https://www.familysearch.org/ |url-access=subscription |accessdate=November 12, 2015 |via=[[FamilySearch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambrose's third son Clement A. Ambrose (1928–1951) was serving as a Sergeant in the [[7th Infantry Regiment (United States)|7th Infantry Regiment]], [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]], when he was [[killed in action]] on February 14, 1951, in the Korean War, at the age of 22. Sergeant Ambrose is buried in the Saint Johns Cemetery, in Joliet, IL. Sergeant Ambrose was awarded the Purple Heart, the Combat Infantryman's Badge, the Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Presidential Unit Citation, and the Republic of Korea War Service Medal. Some sources indicate that Clement Ambrose also reportedly served in the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marines]] during World War II, in the Philippines. His gravestone reads: "Our son S/Sgt. Clement A. Ambrose gave his life on the battlefield of [Korea."&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave |82212746 |Sgt Clement A. Ambrose }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambrose's wife, Marie, died in 1980, at the age of 76. He died on May 1, 1988, less than a month before his 92nd birthday. The [[Joliet Public Library]] lists his obituary in the 1988 Obituary Index: "Ambrose, Joseph F.  Sr. "Doughboy Joe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joliet Public Library 1988 Obituary Index|url=http://jolietlibrary.org/content/1988-obituary-index|website=Joliet Public Library, Illinois|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Ambrose was posthumously honored in a speech given by Senator [[Dick Durbin]], for [[Veterans Day]], in 2012. Durbin said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Joseph Ambrose wore his old Army 'doughboy' uniform and carried his son’s flag often to Veterans Day parades and VFW conventions. He confessed that some years he had to go on a [[Dieting|crash diet]] to squeeze back into it. But he did it to honor the veterans of the Korean and the Vietnam wars, wars he believed America was trying then to forget. He wanted to remind us of an important truth: that no matter the outcome of a war, those who answer the call of duty and risk everything to defend America deserve the respect of a grateful nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congress Should Honor Veterans By Passing Bipartisan Legislation To Create Jobs For Veterans And Improve Mental Health Service|url=http://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-congress-should-honor-veterans-by-passing-bipartisan-legislation-to-create-jobs-for-veterans-and-improve-mental-health-services|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The young lady tries to cover up her out-of-marriage relationship and let the soldier to stay for rest. When Mykhailo arrives soon thereafter she hides the clerk. Moskal knew that something is going on between Tetyana and Fintyk yet he finds a common ground with his hostess. They agreed to get rid of the clerk yet not to spoil her marriage. Then there are few scenes that reflect the peculiar inter-ethnic relationship between [[Ukrainians]] and [[Russians]] in face of the soldier. By the end of the movie the soldier finally pulls the clerk out of a hiding place while Mykhailo is blacking out whether out of a liquor or being shocked realizing the situation. In the last scene everybody explains to Mykhailo what have really happened and why. The husband gets really mad and has an intent to kill everybody, but moskal steps in just in time to defuse the situation.

A '''narrative thread''', or '''plot thread''' (or, more ambiguously, a '''storyline'''), refers to particular elements and techniques of writing to center the story in the action or experience of characters rather than to relate a matter in a dry "all-knowing" sort of narration. Thus the narrative threads experienced by different but specific characters or sets of characters are those seen in the eyes of those characters that together form a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] element or [[subplot]] in the [[Fiction|work of fiction]]. In this sense, each narrative thread is the [[narrative]] portion of a work that pertains to the world view of the participating characters cognizant of their piece of the whole, and they may be the villains, the protagonists, a supporting character, or a relatively disinterested official utilized by the author, each thread of which is woven together by the writer to create a work.

By utilizing different threads, the writer enables the reader to get pieces of the overall plot while positioning them to identify with the characters  or experience the situation as if the reader were part of or eavesdropping upon the action the writer is divulging. This aids in the [[suspension of disbelief]] and engages the reader into the story as it develops.

A classic structure of narrative thread often used in both fiction and non-fiction writing is the [[monomyth]], or [[hero's journey]], with a beginning, a middle, and an end. First, typically the harmony of daily life is broken by a particularly dramatic event that leads into the main story. Then, second, the plot builds to a point of no return, from where the protagonist – who need not be a person but may be an organization or a community – has no choice but to deal with matters, and thus is tested. At this point, characteristically, there is conflict and the conflict intensifies. Third, and finally, harmony is reestablished by the conflict being solved, or at least explained in the case of non-fiction.

The roots of the '''Orton Ceramic Foundation''' date back to the establishment of the "Standard Pyrometric Cone Company" in 1896 by [[Edward J. Orton, Jr.]]. In 1894, he was appointed the first Chairman of the Ceramic Engineering Department at [[Ohio State University]], the first ceramic engineering school in the United States.

Orton died in 1932. In accordance with his will a charitable trust was created to continue the "Standard Pyrometric Cone Company," now known as the "Edward Orton Jr. Ceramic Foundation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Orton - Orton Ceramic Foundation|url=http://www.ortonceramic.com/about-orton}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "Orton Ceramic Foundation" or simply "Orton."  Based in [[Westerville, Ohio]], USA, it has three areas of products and services:

* Produce for monitoring thermal processing.
* Design and build analytical for measuring [[thermal]] properties.
* Provide to measure thermal properties.

A '''Public Lending Right (PLR)''' programme, is a programme intended to either compensate authors for the potential loss of sales from their works being available in [[public library|public libraries]], or as a governmental support of the arts, through support of works available in public libraries, such as books, music and artwork.

Twenty-eight countries have a PLR programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.plrinternational.com/faqs/faqs.htm#recognise |title="Public Lending Right (PLR) International Network website." |access-date=2009-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228224731/http://www.plrinternational.com/faqs/faqs.htm#recognise#recognise |archive-date=2014-02-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others are considering adopting one.  [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], all the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Israel]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] currently have PLR programmes.  There is ongoing debate in [[France]] about implementing one.  There is also a move towards having a Europe-wide PLR programme administered by the [[European Union]].

The first PLR programme was initiated in [[Denmark]] in 1941. However, it was not properly implemented until 1946 due to [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate = 2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea spread slowly from country to country and many nations' PLR programs are quite recent developments.

==National variations==
PLR programmes vary from country to country.  Some, like Germany and the Netherlands, have linked PLR to [[copyright]] legislation and have made libraries liable to pay authors for every [[book]] in their collection.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  Other countries do not connect PLR to copyright. For a nation like Canada or Australia the majority of funds would be going to authors outside the country, much of it to the United States, which is unpalatable to those nations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In Denmark, the current programme is considered a type of governmental support of the arts, not reimbursement of potential lost sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotekogmedier.dk/medieomraadet/biblioteksafgift-mv/biblioteksafgift-for-boeger/ Styrelsen for Bibliotek og Medier] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912014140/http://www.bibliotekogmedier.dk/medieomraadet/biblioteksafgift-mv/biblioteksafgift-for-boeger/ |date=2009-09-12 }} (Danish) 2009-08-19&lt;/ref&gt; Types of works supported are books, music, and visual artworks, created and published in Denmark, and available in public and school libraries.

===Payments===
How amounts of payment are determined also varies from country to country.  Some pay based on how many times a book has been taken out of a library, others use a simpler system of payment based simply on whether a library owns a book or not.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The amount of payments is also variable.  The amount any one author can receive is never very considerable.  In Canada for instance the payment is [[Canadian dollar|C$]]38.30 per book per library, with a maximum of C$2,681 (in 2008) for any one author in a year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} In the United Kingdom authors are paid on a per-loan basis calculated from a representative sample of libraries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The current rate is 7.82 [[Pound sterling|pence]] per individual loan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/britishlibrary/~/media/bl/global/services/plr/pdfs/newsletters/2017newsletter.pdf PLR News 2017 (British Library)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eligibility criteria===
Different countries also have differing eligibility criteria.  In most nations only published works are accepted, government publications are rarely counted, nor are [[bibliography|bibliographies]] or [[dictionary|dictionaries]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  Some PLR services are mandated solely to fund literary works of [[fiction]], and some such as [[Norway]], have a sliding scale paying far less to [[non-fiction]] works.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  Many nations also exclude scholarly and academic texts.

==EU directive==
Within the [[European Union]], the public lending right is regulated since November 1992 by [[directive 92/100/EEC]] on rental right and lending right. A report in 2002 from the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu.int/cgi-bin/eur-lex/udl.pl?REQUEST=Seek-Deliver&amp;COLLECTION=com&amp;SERVICE=eurlex&amp;LANGUAGE=en&amp;DOCID=502PC0502&amp;FORMAT=pdf Report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on the public lending right in the European Union]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF), 2002-09-16
&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that many member countries had failed to implement this directive correctly.

The PLR directive  has met with resistance from the side of the [[International Federation of Library Associations]] (IFLA). The IFLA has stated that  the principles of 'lending right' can jeopardize free access to the services of publicly accessible libraries, which is the citizen's human right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifla.org/III/clm/p1/PublicLendingRigh.htm The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Position on PLR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010081153/http://www.ifla.org/III/clm/p1/PublicLendingRigh.htm |date=2006-10-10 }} (April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The PLR directive and its implementation in public libraries is rejected by a number of European authors, including Nobel Laureates [[Dario Fo]] and [[José Saramago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nopago.org/ |title=Campagna europea contro l'introduzione del prestito a pagamento in biblioteca (in Italian) |publisher=Nopago.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, more than 3000 authors signed a petition opposing PLR cuts in 2010.

'''Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor''' (December 1, 1940&amp;nbsp;– December 10, 2005) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, and social critic. Pryor was known for uncompromising examinations of racism and topical contemporary issues, which employed vulgarities and profanity, as well as [[racial epithets]]. He reached a broad audience with his trenchant observations and storytelling style, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential stand-up comedians of all time.

Pryor's body of work includes the concert movies and recordings: ''[[Live &amp; Smokin'|Richard Pryor: Live &amp; Smokin']]'' (1971), ''[[That Nigger's Crazy]]'' (1974), ''[[...Is It Something I Said?]]'' (1975), ''[[Bicentennial Nigger]]'' (1976), ''[[Richard Pryor: Live in Concert]]'' (1979), ''[[Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip]]'' (1982), and ''[[Richard Pryor: Here and Now]]'' (1983). As an actor, he starred mainly in comedies such as ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), but occasionally in dramas, such as [[Paul Schrader]]'s ''[[Blue Collar (film)|Blue Collar]]'' (1978), or action films, such as ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983). He collaborated on many projects with actor [[Gene Wilder]]. Another frequent collaborator was actor/comedian/writer [[Paul Mooney (comedian)|Paul Mooney]].

Pryor won an [[Emmy Award]] (1973) and five [[Grammy Award]]s (1974, 1975, 1976, 1981, and 1982). In 1974, he also won two American Academy of Humor awards and the [[Writers Guild of America Award]]. The first-ever [[Kennedy Center]] [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] was presented to him in 1998. He was listed at number one on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of all-time greatest stand-up comedians.&lt;ref name=cc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.voxmagazine.com/stories/2004/09/30/why-chappelle-is-the-man/ |title=Why Chappelle is the man |work=[[Columbia Missourian|Vox Magazine]] |date=September 30, 2004 |access-date=September 1, 2016 |quote=Pryor was voted No. 1 in Comedy Central's ''100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time'' in April. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914220958/http://archive.voxmagazine.com/stories/2004/09/30/why-chappelle-is-the-man/ |archivedate=September 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him first on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.&lt;ref name = "RS"&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time].

==Early life==
Born on December 1, 1940 in [[Peoria, Illinois]], Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor grew up in the brothel run by his grandmother, Marie Carter, where his alcoholic mother, Gertrude L. (née Thomas), was a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/richard_the_great_FmHiNQqrDQ08jcRI576TUI |title=Richard the Great |work=[[New York Post]] |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, LeRoy "Buck Carter" Pryor (June 7, 1915&amp;nbsp;– September 27, 1968), was a former boxer and [[Hustling|hustler]].&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richardpryor.com/biography.php|website=RichardPryor.com|title= Richard Pryor's official biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Gertrude abandoned him when he was ten, Pryor was raised primarily by Marie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richardpryor.com/0/4113/0/1240D1271/ |title=Richard Pryor website |publisher=Richardpryor.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523025200/http://www.richardpryor.com/0/4113/0/1240D1271 |archivedate=May 23, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a tall, violent woman who would beat him for any of his eccentricities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/342/000022276/ |title=Richard Pryor |publisher=Nndb.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pryor was one of four children raised in his grandmother's brothel. He was sexually abused at age seven,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jones, Steve|url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-12-10-richard-pryor-obit_x.htm |title=Comedian Richard Pryor dies at 65|work=[[USA Today]]|date= December 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expelled from school at the age of fourteen.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/09/13/a-pryor-love|title=A Pryor Love|author=[[Hilton Als|Als, Hilton]]|date=September 13, 1999|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Peoria, he became a [[Freemason]] at a local lodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/pryor_r/pryor_r.html |title=Richard Pryor|website= GLBCY|accessdate= October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pryor served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] from 1958 to 1960, but spent virtually the entire stint in an army prison. According to a 1999 profile about Pryor in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Pryor was incarcerated for an incident that occurred while he was stationed in [[West Germany]]. Angered that a white soldier was overly amused at the racially charged scenes of [[Douglas Sirk]]'s film ''[[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|Imitation of Life]]'', Pryor and several other black soldiers beat and stabbed him, although not fatally.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt;

==Relationships and children==
Pryor was married seven times to five women:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
#Patricia Price, whom he married in 1960 and divorced the following year
#Shelley Bonus, whom he married in 1967 and divorced in 1969
#Deborah McGuire, whom he married on September 22, 1977; they divorced the following year.
#Jennifer Lee, whom he married in August 1981. They divorced in October 1982, but later remarried on June 29, 2001, and remained married until Pryor's death.
#Flynn Belaine, whom he married in October 1986. They were divorced in July 1987, but later remarried on April 1, 1990. They divorced again in July 1991.

Pryor also had relationships with actresses [[Pam Grier]] and [[Margot Kidder]].&lt;ref name=Rabin&gt;{{cite news|author=Rabin, Nathan Rabin| url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/random-roles-margot-kidder,24554/ |title=Random Roles: Margot Kidder (interview)|work=[[The A.V.

Pryor had seven children with six different women:

===1960s===
[[File:Richard Pryor 1969.JPG|thumb|Publicity photo of Pryor for one of his [[Mister Kelly's]] appearances, 1968–1969]]
In 1963, Pryor moved to New York City and began performing regularly in clubs alongside performers such as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Woody Allen]]. On one of his first nights, he opened for singer and pianist [[Nina Simone]] at New York's [[Village Gate]]. Simone recalls Pryor's bout of [[performance anxiety]]:

{{quote|He shook like he had malaria, he was so nervous. I couldn't bear to watch him shiver, so I put my arms around him there in the dark and rocked him like a baby until he calmed down. The next night was the same, and the next, and I rocked him each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[Nina Simone|Simone, Nina]] &amp; Cleary, Stephen |date=1991|title=[[I Put a Spell on You (book)|I Put a Spell on You: The Autobiography of Nina Simone]]|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York City|pages=70–71|isbn=978-0-679-41068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Inspired by Bill Cosby, Pryor began as a [[middlebrow]] comic, with material far less controversial than what was to come. Soon, he began appearing regularly on television [[variety shows]], such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. His popularity led to success as a comic in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The first five tracks on the 2005 compilation CD ''[[Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974)]]'', recorded in 1966 and 1967, capture Pryor in this period.

In September 1967, Pryor had what he described in his autobiography ''[[Pryor Convictions]]'' (1995) as an "[[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]". He walked onto the stage at the [[Aladdin, Las Vegas|Aladdin Hotel]] in Las Vegas (with [[Dean Martin]] in the audience), looked at the sold-out crowd, exclaimed over the microphone, "What the fuck am I doing here!?", and walked off the stage. Afterward, Pryor began working profanity into his act, including the word "[[nigger]]". His first comedy recording, the eponymous 1968 debut release on the [[Reprise Records|Dove/Reprise]] label, captures this particular period, tracking the evolution of Pryor's routine. Around this time, his parents died—his mother in 1967 and his father in 1968.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.bestcomedyonline.net/comedian-biographies/richard-pryor-personal-life "Richard Pryor-Personal Life"] Retrieved August 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Pryor moved to [[Berkeley, California]], where he immersed himself in the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and rubbed elbows with the likes of [[Huey P. Newton]] and [[Ishmael Reed]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===1970s===
In the 1970s, Pryor wrote for such television shows as ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]'', and a 1973 [[Lily Tomlin]] special, for which he shared an [[Emmy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/richard-pryor |title=Richard Pryor Emmy Winner |work=Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Pryor tried to break into mainstream television. He also appeared in several popular films, including ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'' (1972), ''[[The Mack]]'' (1973), ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]'' (1974), ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'' (1976), ''[[Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings]]'' (1976), ''[[Which Way Is Up?]]'' (1977), ''[[Greased Lightning]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Collar (film)|Blue Collar]]'' (1978), ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979).

Pryor signed with the comedy-oriented independent record label [[Laff Records]] in 1970, and in 1971 recorded his second album, ''Craps (After Hours)''. Two years later, the relatively unknown comedian appeared in the documentary ''[[Wattstax]]'' (1972), wherein he riffed on the tragic-comic absurdities of [[race relations]] in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] and the nation. Not long afterward, Pryor sought a deal with a larger label, and he signed with [[Stax Records]] in 1973.

When his third, breakthrough album, ''[[That Nigger's Crazy]]'' (1974), was released, Laff, which claimed ownership of Pryor's recording rights, almost succeeded in getting an injunction to prevent the album from being sold. Negotiations led to Pryor's release from his Laff contract. In return for this concession, Laff was enabled to release previously unissued material, recorded between 1968 and 1973, at will. ''That Nigger's Crazy'' was a commercial and critical success; it was eventually certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UCQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=that+nigger's+crazy+RIAA+Gold&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PgkZ-6WDZs&amp;sig=wxKBEmpo3wnh2-UKdlKRTaWH4a0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB7ITTuYHKAhXE1B4KHYXCDFsQ6AEIJzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=that%20nigger's%20crazy%20RIAA%20Gold&amp;f=false Paul Green, "Richie Sets Multiplantium Record: Boston Has RIAA Top Debut Album," ''Billboard'', November 15, 1986.]&lt;/ref&gt; and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1975|1975 Grammy Awards]].

During the legal battle, Stax briefly closed its doors. At this time, Pryor returned to [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]/[[Warner Bros. Records]], which re-released ''That Nigger's Crazy'', immediately after ''[[...Is It Something I Said?]]'', his first album with his new label. Like ''That Nigger's Crazy'', the album was a hit with both critics and fans; it was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA and won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording at the 1976 Grammy Awards.

Pryor's release ''[[Bicentennial Nigger]]'' (1976) continued his streak of success. It became his third consecutive gold album, and he collected his third consecutive Grammy for Best Comedy Recording for the album in 1977. With every successful album Pryor recorded for Warner (or later, his concert films and his 1980 [[Freebase (chemistry)|freebasing]] accident), Laff quickly published an album of older material to capitalize on Pryor's growing fame—a practice they continued until 1983. The covers of Laff albums tied in thematically with Pryor movies, such as ''Are You Serious?'' for ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), ''The Wizard of Comedy'' for his appearance in ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' (1978), and ''Insane'' for ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/richard-pryor |title=Richard Pryor Fast Facts |last= |first= |date= |website=Yourdictionary |access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alan Alda Lily Tomlin Richard Pryor 1973.jpg|thumb|180px|Pryor also performed in the [[Lily Tomlin]] specials. He is seen here with Tomlin and [[Alan Alda]] in Tomlin's 1973 special.]]

Pryor co-wrote ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), directed by [[Mel Brooks]] and starring [[Gene Wilder]]. Pryor was to play the lead role of Bart, but the film's production studio would not insure him, and Mel Brooks chose [[Cleavon Little]], instead. Before his horribly damaging 1980 freebasing incident, Pryor was about to start filming Mel Brooks' ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'' (1981), but was replaced at the last minute by [[Gregory Hines]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Pryor was also originally considered for the role of Billy Ray Valentine on ''[[Trading Places]]'' (1983), before [[Eddie Murphy]] won the part.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 1975, Pryor was a guest host on the [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and the first black person to host the show. Pryor took longtime girlfriend, actress-talk show host Kathrine McKee (sister of [[Lonette McKee]]), with him to New York, and she made a brief guest appearance with Pryor on ''SNL''. He participated in the "word association" skit with [[Chevy Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ginterview.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Richard Pryor: 12/13/75: Racist Word Association Interview |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later do his own variety show,''[[The Richard Pryor Show]]'', which premiered on [[NBC]] in 1977. The show was cancelled after only four episodes probably because television audiences did not respond well to his show's controversial subject matter, and Pryor was unwilling to alter his material for network censors. During the short-lived series, [[Black president in popular culture (United States)|he portrayed the first black]] President of the United States, spoofed the ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' [[Mos Eisley]] cantina, took on gun violence, and in another skit, used costumes and visual distortion to appear nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Silverman, David S. |date=2007|title=You Can't Air That: Four Cases of Controversy and Censorship in American Television Programming|location= Syracuse, NY|publisher=Syracuse University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, at the height of his success, Pryor visited Africa. Upon returning to the United States, Pryor swore he would never use the word "[[nigger]]" in his stand-up comedy routine again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/15/opinion/the-nwordand-richard-pryor.html|title=The N-word and Richard Pryor|date=2005-12-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|JZCS5I80X-8|The word 'Nigger'&amp;nbsp;– Richard Pryor &amp; George Carlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
[[File:Richard Pryor (1986) (cropped)-2.jpg|thumb|right|Pryor in February 1986]]
Late in the evening of June 9, 1980, during the making of the film ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'', and after days of [[Free base|freebasing]] [[cocaine]], Pryor poured 151-proof [[rum]] all over himself and lit himself on fire. While ablaze, he ran down Parthenia Street from his [[Los Angeles]] home, until being subdued by police. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for second- and third-degree burns covering more than half of his body. Pryor spent six weeks in recovery at the Grossman Burn Center at [[Sherman Oaks Hospital]]. His daughter, [[Rain Pryor|Rain]], stated that the incident happened as a result of a bout of drug-induced [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Rain Pryor|date= November 6, 2006|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]| page =76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pryor incorporated a description of the incident into his comedy show ''[[Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip]]'' (1982). He joked that the event was caused by dunking a cookie into a glass of low-fat and [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] milk, causing an explosion. At the end of the bit, he poked fun at people who told jokes about it by waving a lit match and saying, "What's that? Richard Pryor running down the street."

After his "final performance", Pryor did not stay away from stand-up comedy long. Within a year, he filmed and released a new concert film and accompanying album, ''[[Richard Pryor: Here and Now]]'' (1983), which he directed himself. He also wrote and directed a fictionalized account of his life, ''[[Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling]]'' (1986), which revolved around the 1980 freebasing incident.

In 1983, Pryor signed a five-year contract with [[Columbia Pictures]] for $40&amp;nbsp;million and he started his own production company, Indigo Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Richard Pryor Ouster of Blacks Criticized |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/17/movies/richard-pryor-ouster-of-blacks-criticized.html |quote=Mr. Pryor announced in May that he had signed a five-year, $40&amp;nbsp;million production deal with Columbia Pictures and promised to open up opportunities for minorities at his Indigo Productions. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date= December 17, 1983 |accessdate=2015-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCobit"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Staff writer]] |date=December 10, 2005| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4517714.stm |title=Comedian Richard Pryor Dead at 65&amp;nbsp;– Groundbreaking Black U.S. Comedian Richard Pryor Has Died after Almost 20 Years with Multiple Sclerosis |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate= January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Softer, more formulaic films followed, including ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983), which earned Pryor $4&amp;nbsp;million; ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'' (1985), ''[[Moving (1988 film)|Moving]]'' (1988), and ''[[See No Evil, Hear No Evil]]'' (1989). The only film project from this period that recalled his rough roots was Pryor's semiautobiographic debut as a writer-director, ''[[Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling]]'' (1986), which was not a major success.

Despite a reputation for constantly using profanity on and off camera, Pryor briefly hosted a children's show on [[CBS]] called ''[[Pryor's Place]]'' (1984). Like ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''Pryor's Place'' featured a cast of puppets, hanging out and having fun in a surprisingly friendly inner-city environment along with several children and characters portrayed by Pryor himself. However, ''Pryor's Place'' frequently dealt with more sobering issues than ''Sesame Street''. It was cancelled shortly after its debut, despite the efforts of famed puppeteers [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] and a theme song by [[Ray Parker, Jr.]] of "[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]" (1984) fame.

Pryor co-hosted the [[Academy Awards]] twice and was nominated for an Emmy for a guest role on the television series ''[[Chicago Hope]]''. Network censors had warned Pryor about his profanity for the Academy Awards, and after a slip early in the program, a five-second delay was instituted when returning from a commercial break. Pryor is also one of only three ''Saturday Night Live'' hosts to be subjected to a rare five-second delay for his 1975 appearance (along with [[Sam Kinison]] in 1986 and [[Andrew Dice Clay]] in 1990).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Pryor developed a reputation for being demanding and disrespectful on film sets, and for making selfish and difficult requests. In his autobiography ''Kiss Me Like a Stranger'', co-star Gene Wilder says that Pryor was frequently late to the set during filming of ''Stir Crazy'', and that he demanded, among other things, a helicopter to fly him to and from set because he was the star. Pryor was also accused of using allegations of on-set racism to force the hand of film producers into giving him more money:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One day during our lunch hour in the last week of filming, the [[craft service]] man handed out slices of watermelon to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during ''Stir Crazy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilder |first=Gene |date=2005 |title=Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJgIe5j1bTsC&amp;pg=PA185#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |pages=185–186 |isbn=978-0-312-33706-3 |oclc=475142187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He appeared in ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' (1989), a comedy-drama crime film starring three generations of black comedians (Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and [[Redd Foxx]]).

===1990s and 2000s===
In his later years starting in the early to mid-1990s, Pryor used a power-operated [[mobility scooter]] due to multiple sclerosis (MS, which he said stood for "More Shit").{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} He appears on the scooter in his last film appearance, a small role in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997) playing an auto-repair garage manager named Arnie.

[[Rhino Records]] remastered all of Pryor's Reprise and WB albums for inclusion in the box set ''[[...And It's Deep Too! The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings (1968–1992)|...And It's Deep Too! The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings]]'' (2000).

In early 2000, Pryor appeared in the cold open of ''[[The Norm Show]]'' in the episode entitled "Norm vs. The Boxer". He played an elderly man in a wheelchair who lost the rights to in-home nursing when he kept attacking the nurses before attacking Norm himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Norm Show&amp;nbsp;– Norm vs. the Boxer |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0662160/ |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Pryor and his wife/manager, Jennifer Lee Pryor, won legal rights to all the Laff material, which amounted to almost 40 hours of reel-to-reel analog tape. After going through the tapes and getting Richard's blessing, Jennifer Lee Pryor gave Rhino Records access to the tapes in 2004. These tapes, including the entire ''Craps'' album, form the basis of the February 1, 2005, double-CD release ''[[Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=CD Universe|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/6817862/a/evolution%2Frevolution%3A+the+early+years+%281966-1974%29.htm|title=Richard Pryor – Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974) CD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
In November 1977, after many years of heavy smoking and drinking, Pryor suffered a mild heart attack. He recovered and resumed performing by January the following year. He was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richardpryor.com/biography.php |title=The Official Biography of Richard Pryor |publisher=Indigo, Inc. |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Pryor suffered a second heart attack while in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-23/news/mn-756_1_heart-attack|title=Richard Pryor Suffers a Minor Heart Attack in Australia|last=Writer|first=From a Times Staff|date=1990-03-23|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underwent triple [[heart bypass]] surgery in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-06-01/news/9106010694_1_richard-pryor-mcelwaine-cracking-jokes|title=Richard Pryor Cracking Jokes After Triple Bypass|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2004, his sister said he had lost his voice as a result of his multiple sclerosis. However, on January 9, 2005, Pryor's wife, Jennifer Lee, rebutted this statement in a post on Pryor's official website, citing Richard as saying: "I'm sick of hearing this shit about me not talking... not true... I have good days, bad days... but I still am a talkin' motherfucker!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richardpryor.com |title=Richard Pryor |publisher=Richard Pryor |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Richard Pryor Hollywood star 2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Richard Pryor's star at the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], covered with items left by fans]]
On December 10, 2005, nine days after his 65th birthday, Pryor suffered a heart attack in Los Angeles. He was taken to a local hospital after his wife's attempts to resuscitate him failed. He was pronounced dead at 7:58&amp;nbsp;am [[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]. His widow Jennifer was quoted as saying, "At the end, there was a smile on his face."&lt;ref name="BBCobit" /&gt; He was [[cremation|cremated]], and his ashes were given to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LWtqCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT486&amp;lpg=PT486&amp;dq=richard+pryor+cremated#v=onepage&amp;q=richard%20pryor%20cremated&amp;f=false|title=Where Are They Buried?: How Did They Die?

== Legacy ==
[[Jerry Seinfeld]] called Pryor "the [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] of our profession"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Morton, Bruce |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/21/morton.thosewelost/index.html |title=Those We Lost|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=January 11, 2010|date=December 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bob Newhart]] heralded Pryor as "the seminal comedian of the last 50 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/newhart_b.html |work=PBS American Masters |title= Bob Newhart}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Chappelle]] said of Pryor, "You know those, like, evolution charts of man?

As [[Bill Cosby]] reportedly once said, "Richard Pryor drew the line between comedy and tragedy as thin as one could possibly paint it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Benson |first=Tambay |title=Richard Pryor Retrospective at BAMcinématek, Brooklyn (10 Days, 20 Films, All in 35&amp;nbsp;mm) |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/richard-pryor-retrospective-at-bamcinematek-brooklyn-10-days-20-films-all-in-35mm |work=Indiewire |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and honors===
In 1998, Pryor won the first [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] from the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]. According to former Kennedy Center President Lawrence J. Wilker, Pryor was selected as the first recipient of the Prize because 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
as a stand-up comic, writer, and actor, he struck a chord, and a nerve, with America, forcing it to look at large social questions of race and the more tragicomic aspects of the human condition. Though uncompromising in his wit, Pryor, like [[Mark Twain|Twain]], projects a generosity of spirit that unites us. They were both trenchant social critics who spoke the truth, however outrageous.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004, Pryor was voted number one on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time.&lt;ref name=cc/&gt; In a 2005 British poll to find "The Comedian's Comedian", Pryor was voted the 10th-greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.

Pryor was posthumously awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Pryor to Get Posthumous Grammy Award |date=January 11, 2006 |work=Voice of America |url=http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-01/Richard-Pryor-to-Get-Posthumous-Grammy-Award.cfm |accessdate=January 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913185314/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-01/Richard-Pryor-to-Get-Posthumous-Grammy-Award.cfm |archivedate=September 13, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animal rights organization [[PETA]] gives out an award in Pryor's name to people who have done outstanding work to alleviate animal suffering. Pryor was active in animal rights and was deeply concerned about the plight of elephants in circuses and zoos.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Artist Preston Jackson created a life-sized bronze statue in dedication to the beloved comedian and named it "Richard Pryor: More than Just a Comedian". It was placed at the corner of State and Washington Streets in downtown Peoria, on May 1, 2015, close to the neighborhood in which he grew up with his mother. The unveiling was held Sunday, May 3, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |date=May 1, 2015 |title=Long effort to honor Peoria-born comedian Richard Pryor culminates in Sunday unveiling |author=Leslie Renken|work= Peoria Journal Star |url=http://m.pjstar.com/article/20150429/NEWS/150428947 |accessdate=May 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrospectives===
In 2002, a television documentary entitled ''The Funny Life of Richard Pryor'' depicted Pryor's life and career.&lt;ref name="explore.bfi.org.uk"&gt;http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b87cb041e&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast in the UK as part of the [[Channel 4]] series ''Kings of Black Comedy'',&lt;ref name="oftv.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.oftv.co.uk/programmes/kings-black-comedy "Kings of Black Comedy"], Oxford Film &amp; Television.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23491363.html&lt;/ref&gt; it was produced, directed and narrated by [[David Upshal]]&lt;ref name="explore.bfi.org.uk" /&gt; and featured rare clips from Pryor's 1960s stand-up appearances and movies such as ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), ''[[Blue Collar (film)|Blue Collar]]'' (1978), ''[[Richard Pryor: Live in Concert]]'' (1978), and ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' (1980).

A television documentary, ''[[Richard Pryor: I Ain't Dead Yet|Richard Pryor: I Ain't Dead Yet, #*%$#@]]!!'' (2003) consisted of archival footage of Pryor's performances and testimonials from fellow comedians, including [[Dave Chappelle]], [[Denis Leary]], [[Chris Rock]], and [[Wanda Sykes]], on Pryor's influence on comedy.

Roseanne Conner is not featured in ''[[The Conners]]'', and is depicted as deceased in the series.

==Creation and conception==
In 1987, coming up with ideas for new shows, [[Marcy Carsey]] and [[Tom Werner]] of [[Carsey-Werner Productions]] decided to look into the concept of the working mother as a central voice. Up until that point, there had been shows with working mothers, but only as an adjunct to the father in the family. Werner had suggested that they take a chance on Barr whom they had seen on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. This was because he saw the unique "in your face" voice that they were looking for, and he contacted her agent and offered her the role. Barr's act at the time was the persona of the "domestic goddess", but as Carsey and Werner explains, she had the distinctive voice and attitude for the character and she was able to transform her into the working class heroine they envisioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/marcy-carsey#|title=Marcy Carsey|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barr immediately took the role.&lt;ref name="EW2008pg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368,00.html|title=A 'Roseanne' Family Reunion – The behind-the-scenes truth about Roseanne Barr's groundbreaking sitcom|last=Stransky|first=Tanner|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|page=1|date=October 24, 2008|accessdate=February 17, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmZxURct?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368,00.html|archivedate=April 8, 2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Barr has stated she had crafted the "fierce working-class domestic goddess" persona in the eight years preceding the sitcom and wanted to do a realistic show about a strong mother who was not a victim of patriarchal consumerism.&lt;ref name=nymag&gt;Barr, R. (May 15, 2011) [http://nymag.com/print/?/arts/tv/upfronts/2011/roseanne-barr-2011-5/ "And I Should Know"] ''New York Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr became outraged when she watched the first episode of ''Roseanne'' and noticed that  Matt Williams was listed as creator in the credits.&lt;ref name="EW2008pg1"/&gt; She told Tanner Stransky of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "We built the show around my actual life and my kids. The 'domestic goddess', the whole thing".&lt;ref name="EW2008pg1"/&gt; In the same interview, Werner said, "I don't think Roseanne, to this day, understands that this is something legislated by the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]], and it's part of what every show has to deal with. They're the final arbiters."&lt;ref name="EW2008pg1"/&gt; During the first season, Barr sought more creative control over her character, opposing Williams' authority. Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set. She threatened to quit the show if Williams did not leave. ABC let Williams go after the thirteenth episode.&lt;ref name="EW2008pg1"/&gt;

==Biography==
Roseanne Conner is a lifelong resident of Lanford, a fictional medium-sized city in [[Illinois]]. She and her younger sister Jackie are the daughters of Beverly and Al Harris. Roseanne married her high school sweetheart Dan Conner and, when the series begins, they have three children: Becky, Darlene and David Jacob ("D.J."); a fourth child, Jerry Garcia, is born late in the series. She and her family deal with the many hardships of poverty, obesity, and domestic troubles with humor.

===Season 1===
Roseanne  is a line worker at Wellman Plastics, along with her sister Jackie and friend Crystal. 
Roseanne's parents, Beverly and Al, consider moving to Lanford, but eventually decide against it. She also deals with Tomboy Darlene struggling with her femininity as she enters puberty and gets her first period, and Becky's dating problems with her first boyfriend Chip. Season one also finds the Conners experiencing, and surviving, a tornado. In the "Death and Stuff" episode a door-to-door salesman dies in the Conners' kitchen, and in the season finale, Roseanne stands up to a new foreman, when she leads Jackie, Crystal, and other coworkers as they quit Wellman Plastics.&lt;ref name="mbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/R/htmlR/roseanne/roseanne.htm|title=Rosanne|publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Roseanne - The Complete First Season|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/17422/roseanne-the-complete-first-season/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2===
Now that they've quit Wellman Plastics, Roseanne and Jackie must find new jobs. Jackie decides to become a police officer. Roseanne cycles through a variety of menial jobs including telemarketer, secretary for Dan's boss, bartender, cashier at a fast-food restaurant, and, finally, sweeping floors at a beauty parlor. At home, Dan's poker buddy Arnie plants a passionate kiss on Roseanne. The Conners celebrate an outrageous Halloween that becomes an annual feature of the series. Roseanne wants 10 minutes to herself in the bathroom; this turns into a bizarre dream sequence which has the entire cast singing parodies of songs from musical comedies. Later, Becky repeatedly rebels against Roseanne and Dan's parental authority. The reappearance of old biker buddy Ziggy reminds Roseanne and Dan of their own rebellious past. Darlene first proves her talent for writing when she wins recognition for her poetry. Roseanne's own writing talents are given a boost when her family fixes up a basement room to serve as a writer's den. This is the first season where we hear Roseanne thinking out loud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Roseanne - The Complete Second Season|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/19096/roseanne-the-complete-second-season/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 3===
The season opens with the Roseanne confronting the issue of pregnancy: She takes a pregnancy test that turns up negative. Roseanne takes on a job as waitress in the restaurant at Rodbell's Department Store, where she meets Leon and Bonnie. Later she locks horns with snooty new neighbor Kathy. In the season finale, Ziggy reappears, proposing to open a motorcycle repair shop with Dan and Roseanne. While they are in the process of getting the business off the ground, Ziggy decides to leave because he doesn't want to feel responsible if the business fails. However, he leaves enough money for Dan to open it by himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Roseanne - The Complete Third Season|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/20924/roseanne-the-complete-third-season/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darlene asks her parents if David can move in, because his mother is moving away and they want to stay together. Roseanne and Dan initially refuse, but when Roseanne sees David's mother being verbally and emotionally abusive, she decides to let him stay because it reminded her of her own troubled childhood with her equally abusive father. Roseanne learns Darlene got an acceptance letter from the art school while David got rejected. At the end of the season, Roseanne fears Darlene will run away to school, although Darlene has already decided not to go. Realizing she was wrong, Roseanne persuades Darlene to not give up on her goals just to stay with David.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Roseanne - The Complete Fifth Season|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/23884/roseanne-the-complete-fifth-season/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 7===
Season seven begins with Roseanne's unexpected pregnancy. 
She battles much drama this season as she tries to get Darlene and David back together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Roseanne - The Complete Seventh Season|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27621/roseanne-the-complete-seventh-season/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 8===
Season eight addresses Roseanne's baby shower and the subsequent arrival of her son, Jerry Garcia Conner. (In a [[Continuity (fiction)#Continuity errors|continuity]] error, the baby had been revealed to be a girl in season seven. Roseanne Barr explained: although originally the show baby was going to be a girl, she subsequently got pregnant in real life and, when they discovered it was going to be a boy, they changed the show baby to a boy.) The season starts when Dan decides to leave the security of his city job to help build the new prison being constructed outside of Lanford. With the pension, final check, and retirement money he receives for leaving his job he decides to give his family the vacation they never had and takes everyone to [[Walt Disney World]].  The season climaxes with a very rushed wedding for Darlene. Immediately after the ceremony, realizing how much has been changing, Dan suffers a heart attack. In the next episode it is revealed that he survives, as DJ saved his life. The season concludes with Dan and Roseanne having a bitter fight after Dan refuses to stick to his diet and exercise plan, rehashing many of the buried personality clashes of the entire series.  They end up wrecking their living room in the process. The credits fade as Roseanne walks out on Dan. Other subjects are DJ's Thanksgiving pageant, Darlene's wedding, and Dan's [[heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Roseanne: Season Eight|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/29559/roseanne-season-eight/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 9===
Roseanne wins the state [[lottery]] jackpot of $108 million; This allows her and her family to live the high life. In the season's final episode, Roseanne reveals that season nine is actually a story written by Roseanne Conner about her life. To cope, Roseanne twisted major elements of her life for the story, which the audience does not discover until the final moments of the series. In reality, Dan's heart attack near the end of Season 8 was fatal and the Conner family did not win the lottery. Also, Jackie is a lesbian and Beverly is straight. Scott is a probate lawyer that Roseanne befriended, and set up with Leon—who she claims isn't very hip like she wrote him to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Roseanne: The Complete Ninth Season|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/31275/roseanne-the-complete-ninth-season/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Season 10 ===
The television program was revived in 2018 on ABC, where it had originally aired, with all main cast including Roseanne Barr returning.

The events that Roseanne claimed were true in the final episode of season nine were [[retcon]]med as being fictional elements of Roseanne's story: in the revival, Dan is still alive, the girls did not end up with the opposite romantic partners, the family did not win the lottery, and neither Jackie nor Beverly is a lesbian.

Roseanne and Dan have lost weight, and Roseanne has been having knee pain for some time. Roseanne has stopped running her diner "The Lunch Box" and it does not appear to be in business at all. She is retired from any paid job and, despite her bad knee which causes her great physical pain, works as an [[Uber]] driver.

Roseanne's knee is such a focal point this season that there are entire episodes devoted to it: "Roseanne Gets the Chair", "[[Netflix]] &amp; Pill", and "Knee Deep". There is also a storyline involving Roseanne taking [[opiate]] medication to ease the pain, and becoming dependent on the drug.

Roseane has three grandchildren; Darlene's children with David, daughter Harris and son Mark, and D.J.'s daughter Mary. D.J. is married to a military veteran named Geena who is still serving; D.J. has also served in the military but he has been presumably honorably discharged. Becky has no children and her husband Mark passed away. Roseanne's younger son Jerry is explained away as living on a fishing boat.

Amid other important plot points, near the end of the season Roseanne's knee becomes especially degenerated and she requires surgery. She and Dan are able to afford this after some lucky happenings.

The program was renewed for an eleventh season but the show was cancelled on May 29, 2018 after Barr made a remark that was highly viewed as [[racism|racist]] on [[Twitter]].

The following month, the other cast members and ABC came to a deal to create an entirely new program entitled ''[[The Conners]]''. In the series premiere in October 2018, it was revealed Roseanne Conner died from an opiate overdose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Christina|last=Dugan|url=https://people.com/tv/roseanne-barr-character-dies-drug-overdose-the-conners-premiere/|title=Roseanne Barr's Character Dies of a Drug Overdose in The Conners Premiere|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=October 16, 2018|accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film chronicles the story of a pregnant woman who suspects that an evil [[cult]] wants to take her baby for use in their rituals.

''Rosemary's Baby'' deals with themes related to [[paranoia]], [[women's liberation]], [[Christianity]] ([[Catholicism]]), and the [[occult]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ward |first=Sarah |title=All of them witches: Individuality, conformity and the occult on screen |journal=Screen Education |issue=83 |year=2016 |pages=34–41 |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=utoronto_main&amp;v=2.1&amp;id=GALE%7CA467335921&amp;it=r&amp;asid=23711336d4c3b97545d608fe155564c9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film earned almost universal acclaim from film critics and won numerous nominations and awards. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]], being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."&lt;ref name= "loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2014/14-210.html|title=New Films Added to National Registry | type = news release | publisher = Library of Congress |accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1965, Guy and Rosemary Woodhouse move into the Bramford apartment building in New York City. Their friend Hutch tries to dissuade them from taking the apartment, informing them of the Bramford's association with cannibalism and murder.

Rosemary meets a young woman, Terry Gionoffrio, a recovering drug addict whom Minnie and Roman Castevet, the Woodhouses' elderly new neighbours, took in from the street. As Rosemary admires a pendant necklace the Castevets gave to Terry, she notices its strange smell. Returning home one night, Guy and Rosemary find that Terry apparently threw herself to her death from the window of the Castevets' seventh-floor apartment.

Rosemary and Guy are quickly befriended by the Castevets. Minnie gives Terry's pendant to Rosemary, telling her it is a [[good luck charm]] and the odd smell is "tannis root". Guy lands a role in a play when the actor who was originally cast inexplicably goes blind. Guy suggests to Rosemary that they have a baby.

On the night they plan to conceive, Minnie brings them individual cups of chocolate mousse. Rosemary passes out and experiences a dreamlike vision in which she is [[incubus|raped by a demonic presence]] in front of Guy, the Castevets, and other Bramford tenants, all of them naked. When she wakes, she finds scratches on her body. Guy tells her that he had sex with her while she was unconscious because he did not want to pass up the opportunity for her to conceive. Rosemary learns that she is pregnant and is due on June 28, 1966. She plans to receive obstetric care from Dr. Hill, who is recommended to her by her friend Elise. However, the Castevets insist she see their good friend, Dr. Abraham Sapirstein, who says that Minnie will make Rosemary a daily health drink.

For the first three months of her pregnancy, Rosemary suffers severe abdominal pains, loses weight, becomes unusually pale, and craves raw meat and chicken liver. When Hutch sees Rosemary's gaunt appearance and hears that she is being fed tannis root, he is disturbed enough to do some research. Before he can tell Rosemary his findings, he falls into a coma. Rosemary tells Guy that she plans to see Dr. Hill, which angers Guy. However, the abdominal pains suddenly disappear.

Three months later, Hutch dies. Before dying he manages to briefly regain consciousness, directing his friend Grace Cardiff to give Rosemary a book about [[witchcraft]] along with the cryptic message: "The name is an [[anagram]]". Rosemary deduces that Roman Castevet is really Steven Marcato, the son of a former resident of the Bramford who was accused of being a [[Satanist]]. She suspects her elderly neighbors and Dr. Sapirstein are part of a Satanic [[coven]] with sinister designs for her baby, and that Guy is cooperating with them in exchange for help in advancing his acting career.

Rosemary becomes increasingly disturbed and shares her fears and suspicions with Dr. Hill, who, assuming she is delusional, calls Dr. Sapirstein and Guy. They tell her that if she cooperates, neither she nor the baby will be harmed. Rosemary goes into labor and is sedated by Dr. Sapirstein. When she wakes, she is told the baby has died, which she refuses to believe.

In the hall closet, Rosemary discovers a secret door leading into the Castevets' apartment and hears a baby's cries. She finds a congregation made up of the building's tenants, as well as Dr. Sapirstein, gathered around her newborn son. It is remarked upon that the baby has "his father's eyes," to which Rosemary protests that the baby's eyes are nothing like Guy's.

It is then explained to Rosemary that Guy is not the child's true father. Her newborn child, named Adrian, is actually the [[Antichrist|son of the Devil]]. Roman urges her to become a mother to her son, as the other women are too old. Guy attempts to calm a horrified Rosemary by explaining to her that they will be generously rewarded, and that they can conceive a second child that will truly be theirs. Rosemary spits in his face. Minnie tells Rosemary that she should be honored to be the woman chosen to bear a child for Satan. Initially reluctant, Rosemary goes to the cradle and gently rocks him, with a small smile on her face.

==Production==
===Script===
In ''Rosemary's Baby: A Retrospective'', a featurette on the DVD release of the film, screenwriter/director Roman Polanski, [[Paramount Pictures]] executive [[Robert Evans]], and [[production designer]] [[Richard Sylbert]] reminisce at length about the production. Evans recalled [[William Castle]] brought him the [[galley proof]]s of the book and asked him to purchase the film rights even before [[Random House]] released the publication. The studio head recognized the commercial potential of the project and agreed with the stipulation that Castle, who had a reputation for [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] [[horror film]]s, could produce but not direct the film adaptation. He makes a cameo appearance as the man at the phone booth waiting for Mia Farrow to finish her call.

Evans admired Polanski's European films and hoped he could convince him to make his American debut with ''Rosemary's Baby''. He knew the director was a ski buff who was anxious to make a film with the sport as its basis, so he sent him the script for ''[[Downhill Racer]]'' along with the galleys for ''Rosemary''. Polanski read the latter book non-stop through the night and called Evans the following morning to tell him he thought ''Rosemary'' was the more interesting project, and would like the opportunity to write as well as direct it.

The script was modeled very closely on the original novel and incorporated large sections of the novel's dialogue and details, so much so that nearly every line of dialogue was taken from the novel's text. Author Ira Levin claimed that during a scene in which Guy mentions wanting to buy a particular shirt advertised in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Polanski was unable to find the specific issue with the shirt advertised and phoned Levin for help. Levin, who had assumed while writing that any given issue of ''The New Yorker'' would contain an ad for men's shirts, admitted that he had made it up.&lt;ref&gt;King, Stephen (1985). ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]'', p. 296. [[Berkley Books]], New York. {{ISBN|0-425-08842-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
Polanski envisioned Rosemary as a robust, full-figured, girl-next-door type, and he wanted [[Tuesday Weld]] or his own then-fiancée [[Sharon Tate]] for the role. Since the book had not reached bestseller status yet, Evans was unsure the title alone would guarantee an audience for the film, and he felt a bigger name was needed for the lead. [[Mia Farrow]] – with only a supporting role in ''[[Guns at Batasi]]'' (1964) and the then-unreleased ''[[A Dandy in Aspic]]'' (1968) as her only feature film credits – had an unproven box office track record, but her role as [[Allison MacKenzie]] in the popular television series ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'' and her unexpected marriage to [[Frank Sinatra]] had made her a household name.

[[Patty Duke]] auditioned for the role of Rosemary Woodhouse but lost out to Mia Farrow.

Despite her waif-like appearance (which would ultimately prove beneficial, as Rosemary became more frail as her pregnancy progressed), Polanski agreed to cast her. Her acceptance incensed Sinatra, who had demanded she forgo her career when they wed, and he served her divorce papers via a corporate lawyer in front of the cast and crew midway through filming. In an effort to salvage her relationship, Farrow asked Evans to release her from her contract, but he persuaded her to remain with the project after showing her an hour-long [[rough cut]] and assuring her she would receive an [[Academy Award]] nomination for her performance. Farrow was not nominated for the award, but stayed with the film, which pleased Evans, Polanski and the entire cast.

[[Robert Redford]] was the first choice for the role of Guy Woodhouse, but he turned down the offer. [[Jack Nicholson]] was considered briefly before Polanski suggested [[John Cassavetes]].

Sylbert was a good friend of [[Garson Kanin]], who was married to Ruth Gordon, and he suggested her for the role of Minnie Castevet. He also suggested that [[the Dakota]], an [[Upper West Side]] apartment building known for its show business tenants, be used for the Bramford. Its hallways were not as worn and dark as Polanski wanted, but when the building's owners would not allow interior filming, it became a moot point and was used for exterior shots only.

Polanski wanted to cast Hollywood old-timers as the coven members but did not know any by name. He drew sketches of how he envisioned each character, and they were used to fill the roles. In every instance, the actor cast strongly resembled Polanski's drawing. They included [[Ralph Bellamy]], [[Patsy Kelly]], [[Elisha Cook, Jr.]], [[Phil Leeds]] and [[Hope Summers]].

When Rosemary calls Donald Baumgart, the actor who goes blind and is replaced by Guy, the voice heard is that of actor [[Tony Curtis]]. Farrow, who had not been told who would be reading Baumgart's lines, recognized the voice but could not place it. The slight confusion she displays throughout the call was exactly what Polanski hoped to capture by not revealing Curtis' identity in advance.

===Filming===
When Farrow was reluctant to film a scene that depicted a dazed and preoccupied Rosemary wandering into the middle of a Manhattan street into oncoming traffic, Polanski pointed to her pregnancy padding and reassured her, "no one's going to hit a pregnant woman". The scene was successfully shot with Farrow walking into real traffic and Polanski following, operating the hand-held camera since he was the only one willing to do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=89031&amp;rss=mrqe | contribution = Rosemary's Baby | publisher = TCM | title = Archives | type = movie presentation}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One scene that was shot but was later deleted involved Farrow's character attending an [[Off-Broadway]] production of ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' and encountering [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Van Johnson]], who were playing themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/2012/01/joan_crawford_w_1.php | contribution = Joan Crawford Was Cut From Rosemary's Baby! | title = Daily musto | publisher = Village Voice | date = January 9, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The [[lullaby]] played over the intro is the song "[[Sleep Safe and Warm]]" and was composed by [[Krzysztof Komeda]] and sung by [[Mia Farrow]].&lt;ref name="Culture.pl"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rosemary’s Baby: The Devil Was Not Only in the Details |url=https://culture.pl/en/article/rosemarys-baby-the-devil-was-not-only-in-the-details |website=Culture.pl |accessdate=27 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
From contemporary reviews, [[Renata Adler]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "The movie—although it is pleasant—doesn't seem to work on any of its dark or powerful terms. I think this is because it is almost too extremely plausible. The quality of the young people's lives seems the quality of lives that one knows, even to the point of finding old people next door to avoid and lean on.

Ruth Gordon won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance in this film. Farrow's performance garnered numerous awards, including the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress]], and established her as a leading actress.

Today, the film is widely regarded as a classic; the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the movie a 99% rating (68 out of 69 reviews), with the site's consensus describing it as "A frightening tale of satanism and pregnancy that is even more disturbing than it sounds thanks to convincing and committed performances by Mia Farrow and Ruth Gordon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rosemarys_baby/|title= Rosemary's Baby (1968)|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ''Rosemary's Baby'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Following the film's premiere, a string of other films focusing on Satan worshippers and black magic appeared, including ''[[The Brotherhood of Satan]]'', ''[[Mark of the Devil]]'', ''[[Black Noon]]'', and ''[[The Blood on Satan's Claw]]''.

The scene in which Rosemary is raped by Satan was ranked #23 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[The 100 Scariest Movie Moments]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071030070540/http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml ''100 Scariest Movie Moments''] (via [[Internet Archive]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty years after he wrote ''Rosemary's Baby'', Ira Levin wrote ''[[Son of Rosemary]]'', a sequel which he dedicated to the film's star, Mia Farrow. Reaction to the book was mixed, but it made the best seller lists nationwide.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The American hardcore band [[Rosemary's Babies]] (formed in 1980) was named after the movie. R&amp;B artist [[SZA (singer)|SZA]] included audio clips from the film on her 2013 EP ''[[S (EP)|S]]'' in the songs "Terror.Dome" and "Kismet".

The TV series ''[[Roseanne (television show)|Rosanne]]'' parodied the film in the season 9 episode "[[Satan, Darling]]," in which Roseanne has a nightmare of her daughter Darlene giving birth to Satan.&lt;ref&gt;''Rosanne'' season 8, episode 7 (episode 205 overall) (October 29, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rosemary's Baby'' DVD, released in 2000, contains a 23-minute [[documentary film]], ''[[Mia and Roman]]'', directed by [[Shahrokh Hatami]], which was shot during the making of the film. The title refers to [[Mia Farrow]] and [[Roman Polanski]]. The film features footage of Roman Polanski directing the film's cast on set. Hatami was an Iranian photographer who befriended Polanski and his wife [[Sharon Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfae.com/index.php?ID=101&amp;action=gallery&amp;status=show_artist Shahrokh Hatami]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mia and Roman'' was screened originally as a promo film at Hollywood's Lytton Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Checking Rumors on a 'Wild Bunch' | periodical=Los Angeles Times | date=July 9, 1968 | page=E11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later included as a [[featurette]] on the ''Rosemary's Baby'' DVD. It is described as a "trippy on-set featurette"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,278220,00.html | periodical=Entertainment Weekly | title=DVD Review: Rosemary's Baby: Collector's Edition | author=Mark Harris | date=October 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "an odd little bit of cheese."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | periodical=Orlando Sentinel | date=October 20, 2000 | page=42 | title=POLANSKI BALANCES TERROR, HUMOR THE DIRECTOR ADDS DECEIT UPON DECEIT IN ROSEMARY'S BABY UNTIL WE FINALLY FIND THE TRUTH}}: "Also of interest is the short featurette Mia and Roman, an odd little bit of cheese shot during the production of Rosemary's Baby in which we learn that ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The DVD also contains ''Rosemary's Baby: A Retrospective'', a featurette in which screenwriter/director [[Roman Polanski]], [[Paramount Pictures]] executive [[Robert Evans]], and [[production designer]] [[Richard Sylbert]] reminisce at length about the production.

==Sequel and remake==
In the 1976 [[television movie|television film]] ''[[Look What's Happened to Rosemary's Baby]]'', [[Patty Duke]] starred as Rosemary Woodhouse and Ruth Gordon reprised her role of Minnie Castevet. The film introduced an adult Andrew/Adrian attempting to earn his place as the Antichrist. It was disliked as a sequel by critics and viewers, and its reputation deteriorated over the years.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

A remake of ''Rosemary's Baby'' was briefly considered in 2008. The intended producers were [[Michael Bay]], [[Andrew Form]], and [[Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Rosemary-s-Baby-Remake-Confirmed-8144.html |title=Rosemary's Baby Remake Confirmed |publisher= Cinema blend |accessdate= May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remake fell through later that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0634218/ | title = Rosemary's Baby Remake Scrapped | publisher = IMDb | date = 22 December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, [[NBC]] made a four-hour ''[[Rosemary's Baby (miniseries)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' [[miniseries]] with [[Zoe Saldana]] as Rosemary. The miniseries was filmed in [[Paris]] under the direction of [[Agnieszka Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/01/zoe-saldana-to-topline-nbc-miniseries-rosemarys-baby |title= Zoe Saldana To Topline NBC Miniseries ‘Rosemary’s Baby’|publisher= Deadline|last= Andreeva |first= Nellie |date= 8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rotating bookmarks''' were a special kind of [[bookmark]] used in medieval Europe. They were attached to a string, along which a marker could be slid up and down to mark a precise level on the page. Attached to the marker was a rotating disk that could indicate the column (usually numbered one to four, indicating the two columns on the left-hand page, and the two columns on the right-hand page).

About 30 such rotating bookmarks have been recorded in libraries in [[continental Europe]], and another half a dozen in England.

The '''Salle Ventadour''', a former Parisian theatre in the rue Neuve-Ventadour, now the rue Méhul ([[2nd arrondissement of Paris]]), was built between 1826 and 1829 for the [[Opéra-Comique]], to designs by [[Jacques-Marie Huvé]], a prominent architect. The original theatre had a capacity of 1,106, but was subsequently taken over by the [[Théâtre-Italien (1801–1878)|Théâtre-Italien]] and expanded to a capacity of 1,295 in 1841, thereafter becoming perhaps most noteworthy as the theatre in which the majority of the operas of the Italian composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]] were first performed in France. When the Théâtre-Italien company went out of business in 1878, the theatre was converted to offices.

==Opéra-Comique==
The Opéra-Comique first performed at the Salle Ventadour on 20 April 1829. The opening night audience was a distinguished one and found the new theatre luxurious and comfortable.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt; The program included the one-act opera ''Les deux mousquetaires'' by [[Henri Montan Berton]], the overture to [[Étienne Méhul]]'s opera ''[[Le jeune Henri]]'', and the three-act opera ''La fiancée'' with music by [[Daniel Auber]] and a libretto by [[Eugène Scribe]]. The Opéra-Comique presented 32 premieres during its time at the Salle Ventadour, including one of [[François-Adrien Boieldieu]]'s last operas ''Les deux nuits'' on 20 May 1829, Auber's ''[[Fra Diavolo (opera)|Fra Diavolo]]'' (as ''L'hôtellerie de Terracine'') on 28 January 1830, and [[Ferdinand Hérold]]'s ''[[Zampa]]'' on 3 May 1831.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wild and Charlton (2005), pp.  77&amp;ndash;78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Simeone&gt;Simeone (2000), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; After 22 March 1832 the Opéra-Comique left the Salle Ventadour and moved to the [[Salle de la Bourse]], where it opened on 24 September 1832.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charlton&gt;Charlton, David. "Paris. 4. 1789&amp;ndash;1870." in Sadie (1992) '''3''': 867, 869, 871.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Théâtre Nautique==
The Salle Ventadour was reopened on 10 June 1834&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt; as the Théâtre Nautique&amp;nbsp;— "nautique" since some of the main attractions were works performed in a basin of water on the stage. The programs included the [[ballet]]-[[pantomime]] ''Les ondines'', which was based on [[Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué|Fouqué]]'s novella ''[[Undine (novella)|Undine]]'', about a water sprite who marries a knight in order to save her soul, and used music from [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s [[Undine (Hoffmann)|opera of the same name]]; a full-length ballet ''William Tell'' with music by the German composer Jacques Strunz; a one-act ballet ''Le nouveau Robinson'' which also utilized the water; and a [[chinoiserie]]&lt;!--entr'acte?--&gt; entitled ''Chao-Kang''. These were interspersed with choruses by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] and others, sung by the members of a German company that was being formed in Paris at that time. The [[entr'acte]] was the overture to Weber's opera ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]''. The reviews were not good, and the size of the audience decreased over time.

[[Harriet Smithson]], the Irish actress who had married the French composer [[Hector Berlioz]] on 3 October 1833,&lt;ref&gt;Cairns (1999), p.  11.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared with the Théâtre Nautique, opening on 22 November 1834 in a one-act pantomime put together by the resident choreographer Louis Henry. He called the concoction ''La derniére heure d'un condamné'', and it used music by [[Cesare Pugni]]. The scenario took advantage of her talent for mad scenes: she had previously performed Ophelia in an English-language production of Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the [[Théâtre de l'Odéon]] to great acclaim in 1827. The new piece was a pantomime, since Smithson's French was far from perfect (and remained so for the rest of her life).&lt;ref&gt;Cairns (1969), pp.  619&amp;ndash;620; Barzun (1969) '''1''': 264; '''2''': 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this new performance was not as favorably received. Jules Janin, writing in the ''[[Journal des débats]]'' described it as consisting of "the two or three dozen contortions that are known as the art of mime" and complained that "they have cut Miss Smithson's tongue out".&lt;ref name=Cairns36&gt;Cairns (1999), pp.  36&amp;ndash;40.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlioz anonymously wrote a positive review that appeared in the ''Gazette musicale'' but spent half of its time describing her previous appearance as Ophelia and the important influence it had had on the French style of acting. Not all the reviews were entirely negative: the English-language ''[[Giovanni Antonio Galignani|Galignani's Messenger]]'' praised Smithson, saying that the "single feature worth naming of this piece is the performance of Madame Berlioz, as the wife of the ''condamné'', in which the agony and despair of such a situation is depicted with the fidelity and painful truth only within the reach of a perfect artiste."&lt;ref name=Cairns36/&gt; But apparently her performances were not enough to rescue the enterprise, and the Théâtre Nautique closed in 1835.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;

==A short visit by the Théâtre-Italien==
The Salle Ventadour was used for a brief time by the [[Théâtre-Italien (1801–1878)|Théâtre-Italien]] (30 January 1838 to 31 March 1838) after the destruction of the company's previous home, the Salle Favart, by fire on 15 January 1838. Only one opera new to Paris was presented, Gaetano Donizetti's ''[[Parisina (opera)|Parisina]]''. The company moved to the Odéon for three years before returning to the Salle Ventadour in 1841.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charlton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Levin&gt;Levin, Alicia C. "A documentary overview of musical theaters in Paris, 1830&amp;ndash;1900" in Fauser (2009), pp.  379&amp;ndash;402.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Théâtre de la Renaissance==
While the Théâtre-Italien company was at the Odéon, the Salle Ventadour was rented by Anténor Joly, who with the encouragement of the two great French romantic dramatists [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]], remodeled the theatre and renamed it the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]]. Their aim was to bring together in one theatre the elitist and popular audiences of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Londré 1991, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; The new company opened on 8 November 1838 with the premiere of Hugo's drama ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' with [[Frédérick Lemaître]] in the title role. It ran for 48 performances. Two new plays by Dumas were also presented, ''Bathilde'' (14 January 1839) and ''L'alchimiste'' (10 April 1839), although these were less successful.&lt;ref&gt;Hochman 1984, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The repertoire of the company was not limited to plays: Joly also mounted three new operas by [[Friedrich von Flotow]], including ''Lady Melvil'' on 15 November 1838 (with some music also written by [[Albert Grisar]]&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Malcolm; Lindgren, Lowell. "Grisar, Albert" in Sadie (1992) '''2''': 546&amp;ndash;547.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sophie Anne Thillon]] as Lady Melvil&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. "Thillon [née Hunt], Sophie Anne" in Sadie (1992) '''4''': 725.&lt;/ref&gt;), ''L'eau merveilleuse'' on 30 January 1839, and ''Le naufrage de la Méduse'' on 31 May 1839;&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Peter. "Flotow, Friedrich (Adolph Ferdinand)" in Sadie (1992) '''2''': 242&amp;ndash;246.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 6 August 1839 the premiere of Donizetti's ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor#Lucie de Lammermoor|Lucie de Lammermoor]]'', a French version of his ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'', with Thillon as Lucia and Achille Ricciardi as Edgardo.&lt;ref&gt;Ashbrook, William. "''Lucia di Laamermoor''" in Sadie (1992) '''3''': 69&amp;ndash;72.&lt;/ref&gt; Joly's venture was short-lived however, closing on 16 May 1841.

==The Théâtre-Italien settles in==
[[File:Salle Ventadour interior 1843 NGOp871.jpg|thumb|270px|A performance by the Théâtre-Italien at the Salle Ventadour (ca. 1843).]]
After the Théâtre de la Renaissance closed in 1841 the theater was expanded to a capacity of 1,294&lt;ref name=Charlton/&gt; and was again used by the Théâtre-Italien company from 2 October 1841 to 28 June 1878.&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt; During this time the company presented the premiere of Donizetti's ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' (3 January 1843) and the Paris premieres of 15 of Verdi's operas, including ''[[Nabucco]]'' (1845),&lt;ref name=Charlton/&gt; ''[[Ernani]]'' (1846, as ''Il Proscritto''),&lt;ref&gt;Budden, Julian (1973). ''The operas of Verdi: from Oberto to Rigoletto'', p.  146. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-520030-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Il trovatore]]'' (23 December 1854), ''[[La traviata]]'' (6 December 1856), ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (19 January 1857), ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'' (13 January 1861),&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt; and ''[[Aida]]'' (22 April 1876) with Verdi conducting.&lt;ref&gt;Busch, Hans, ed. and translator (1978). ''Verdi's Aida: the history of an opera in letters and documents'', p.  395n. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8166-0798-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the important singers appearing in Verdi's operas were [[Giorgio Ronconi]], [[Adelaide Borghi-Mamo]], and [[Gaetano Fraschini]].&lt;ref name=Charlton/&gt; Verdi is reported to have referred to the Salle Ventadour as his favorite opera house in Paris.&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charlton/&gt;

Besides opera, the Salle Ventadour was also sometimes used for concerts. [[Stabat Mater (Rossini)|Giaocchino Rossini's ''Stabat Mater'']] received its premiere there on 7 January 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Rossini, Gioacchino; Tomlleri, Luciano, editor (1957). ''Stabat Mater per due soprani, tenore, basso, coro ed orchestra''. Mainz: Eulenberg. {{OCLC|632707761}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Wagner]] conducted three concerts devoted to his own music, including extracts from ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'', ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'', ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', and ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', on 25 January, 1 and 8 February 1860.&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Richard (1860). ''Concert de Richard Wagner'' [25 janvier, 1er et 8 février 1860, salle Ventadour].

Paris: Aubusson et Kugelmann. {{OCLC|458820627}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Verdi conducted the Paris premiere of his ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'' on 30 May 1876.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;

The Théâtre-Italien shared the theater briefly, from 26 June to 4 July 1853, with the Opéra-Comique,&lt;ref&gt;Wild and Charlton (2005), p.  85.&lt;/ref&gt; and from 16 March 1868 to 5 May 1868 the theater was shared with a new company directed by [[Léon Carvalho]], which was an extension of his [[Théâtre Lyrique]] on the Place du Châtelet. The name [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]] was revived for the use of Carvalho's venture, in order to distinguish it from the Théâtre-Italien. Carvalho had overextended himself, however, and soon went bankrupt.&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 1981, pp. 235–238.&lt;/ref&gt; The Théâtre-Italien also shared the theater with the [[Paris Opéra]] from 19 January to December 1874 (in the period after the Opéra's [[Salle Le Peletier]] burned down on 28 October 1873 and before the opening of the Opéra's new [[Palais Garnier]] on 5 January 1875).&lt;ref&gt;Langham Smith, Richard. "Paris. 5. 1870&amp;ndash;1902." in Sadie (1992) '''3''': 874.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies sharing the theatre usually performed on alternate nights.&lt;ref&gt;Apthorp, William F. (1892). "Paris theatres and concerts. II. The Opéra, the Opéra-Comique, and the Conservatoire." ''Scribner's Magazine'' '''11''': 350&amp;ndash;365.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the instigation of the French tenor [[Victor Capoul]] the first professional public performance of the opera ''Les amants de Vérone'' with text and music by the {{Ill|Paul, Marquis d'Ivry|lt=marquis d'Ivry|fr|Paul de Richard d'Ivry}} was mounted at the Salle Ventadour on 12 October 1878. The libretto follows Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' more closely than that of the [[Roméo et Juliette|opera by Gounod]], but the marquis d'Ivry's opera suffered in comparison. Capoul sang Romeo, and the Belgian soprano [[Marie Heilbronn]] sang Juliet. The same singers later appeared in a production at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] which was performed three times beginning on 24 May 1879. The text was considered "coarse", and the music received a lukewarm response.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Elizabeth. "Ivry, Paul Xavier Désiré, Marquis d' [Yrvid, Richard]" in Sadie (1992) '''2''': 862&amp;ndash;863.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Théâtre-Italien company went out of business in 1878, the Salle Ventadour was sold on 20 January 1879 and transformed into offices. The building has been primarily occupied by the [[Banque de France]] since 1893.&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt; [[Gustave Chouquet]], writing in the 1900 edition of George Grove's ''Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', described the renovated building as follows: "its pediment, still decorated with statues of the Muses, now bears the words 'Banque d'escompte de Paris,' a truly exasperating sight".&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;

A '''shimmy''' is a dance move in which the body is held still, except for the shoulders, which are quickly alternated back and forth.  When the right shoulder goes back, the left one comes forward. It may help to hold the arms out slightly bent at the elbow, and when the shoulders are moved, keep the hands in the same position.

== History ==
In 1917, a dance-song titled "Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble" by [[Spencer Williams]] was published, as was "The Jazz Dance", which included the "Shimmy-She", among others.

[[Gilda Gray]] attributed the origin of the 'Shimmy' to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in a 1919 interview with [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] saying "You may not believe it but the original shimmy dance has never been properly introduced in New York. I know, for I have studied the dancing characteristics of the Indians for a long time and they are really responsible for the shimmy which they labeled the 'Shima Shiwa'. There have been continual efforts on the part of this dancer and that one, with each declaring that his or her version is the 'original.' There is no doubt but that the shimmy dance as it was constructed by the American Indian... would have a greater popularity if done right."

"[[I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate]]" was an up-tempo jazz dance song, written by [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]] and [[Armand J. Piron|Armand Piron]], and published in 1919 which has been enduringly popular ever since and performed and recorded by many artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjTJWediME4|title=Original Memphis Five - I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate|last=|first=|date=11 September 1922|website=|publisher=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flapper]]s often performed the dance in the 1920s. The origin of the name is often attributed to [[Gilda Gray]], a Polish emigrant to America. An anecdote says that when she was asked about her dancing style, she answered, in heavy accent, "I'm shaking my ''[[chemise]]''". However, in an interview Gilda denied having said this, and earlier usages of the word are recorded. In the late 1910s, others were also attributed as being the "inventor" of the shimmy, including [[Bee Palmer]]. [[Mae West]], in her autobiography ''Goodness Had Nothing to Do with It'', claimed to have retitled the "Shimmy-Shawobble" as the Shimmy herself, after seeing the moves in some black nightclubs.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

The dance was often considered to be obscene and was frequently banned from dance halls during the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcemYjTdvZ8&amp;index=8&amp;list=RDPjTJWediME4|title = The Roaring Twenties - Dancing The Shimmy|date = 1920s|accessdate = |website = |publisher = YouTube|last = |first = |quote = Press reports on banning at  0:55 and 1:16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The move is also known in [[Romani people|Gypsy]] dances. In Russian this move is called "[[Tsyganochka]]", or "gypsy girl", and is done by gypsy female dancers to produce a chime of costume decorations made of the sewn-on coins.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

The dance move with this name is used in various modern dances.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

In the early 1960s, several dance songs featuring the Shimmy became hits, including [[Bobby Freeman]]'s "[[Shimmy, Shimmy]]", [[The Olympics (band)|the Olympics]]' "[[Shimmy Like Kate]]", and [[Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials]]' "[[Down Down Baby|Shimmy Shimmy Ko-ko Bop]]".

[[Steph Curry]] of the [[Golden State Warriors]] is known to perform the shimmy as a celebration.

== Belly dance ==
{{Split section|Shimmy (belly dance)|date=March 2018}}

The shimmy is also a class of [[belly dance]] moves. Depending on the desired effect, style, teacher, and country of origin of the particular dance, a shimmy might be executed differently, but altogether, the shimmy will manifest as a fast shaking or shuddering movement that can be rhythmic or arrhythmic.  The movement may be localized, such as in the hips, shoulder, chest, etc., or the move might be loose and general, reverberating through the entire body. Shimmies in belly dance can also have orientation, such as an up/down movement or a twisting movement of the hips.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

__NOTOC__
'''''Source: Music of the Avant-Garde''''' – also known and hereafter referred to as ''Source Magazine'' – was an independent, not-for-profit musical and artistic magazine published between 1967 and 1973 by teachers and students of the [[University of California, Davis]], California. It emerged from the flourishing Californian musical experimentalism of the late 1950s-early 1960s, at UC-Davis and [[Mills College]].&lt;ref name="Bernstein_265"&gt;Bernstein (2008), Thomas M. Welsh, ''Chronology'', p.265&lt;/ref&gt; The 11 issues document new music practices of the period like [[Aleatoric music|indeterminacy]], [[performance]], [[graphic notation (music)|graphic scores]], [[electronic music]] and [[intermedia]] arts.

==Origin==
''Source Magazine'''s board of editors first met in the '''New Music Ensemble''', formed in 1963, an improvised music group led by UC-Davis music teacher [[Larry Austin]]&lt;ref name="Austin_1"&gt;Austin (2011), ''Introduction'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; and comprising two of his students: Stanley Lunetta on drums and [[Dary John Mizelle]] on trombone, in addition to [[Wayne Johnson]], bass clarinet ; Art Woodbury, saxophone ; and [[Richard Swift (composer)|Richard Swift]], keyboards, sometimes augmented by occasional visitors like flutist [[Jon Gibson (minimalist musician)|Jon Gibson]] or soprano Billie Alexander.

In the Spring of 1966, the group officially launched the '''Composer/Performer Edition''' imprint with the idea of publishing a catalog of graphic scores and avantgarde music related material by composers they felt close to, like [[Frederic Rzewski]], [[Cornelius Cardew]], Allan Bryant, or Jon Phetteplace of [[Musica Elettronica Viva]].&lt;ref name="Austin_2"&gt;Austin (2011), ''Introduction'', p.2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, they sent a mailing of 5,000 invitations nationwide, calling for pieces in the form of original scores. Composer/Performer Edition published some of these music scores separately, but the team felt the need to collect the material they received in the form of a magazine titled ''Source''. Austin, Lunetta, Mizelle, Johnson, Woodburry and administrative manager Paul Roberts formed the magazine's board,&lt;ref name="Austin_x"&gt;Austin (2011), Douglas Kahn, ''Preface'', p.x&lt;/ref&gt; with Austin becoming chief editor.

A twelfth issue was planned but never made it to printing due to lack of internal funding.&lt;ref name="Sacramento Press"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burg|first1=William|title=Sacramento’s Source of the Avant-Garde|url=http://sacramentopress.com/2013/10/01/sacramentos-source-of-the-avant-garde/|website=http://sacramentopress.com/|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circulation ==
Each issue had a print run of 2,000 copies, although the first issue originally ran 1,000 copies before selling out and warranting an additional 1,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Sacramento Press"/&gt; According to chief editor Larry Austin, the spiral-bound, 10 ¾ x 13 ½ inches landscape format was inspired by some of John Cage's graphic scores&lt;ref name="Austin_3"&gt;Austin (2011), ''Introduction'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the benefit of being able to stand the magazine up on a piano or music stand when performing pieces.&lt;ref name="Ginsberg Thesis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginsberg|first1=Maya|title=DOCUMENTING THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENTAL TRADITION:  A HISTORICAL EXAMINATION OF SOURCE AND SOUNDINGS|date=2011|publisher=San Diego State University|page=22|url=http://sdsu-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.10/1344/Ginsberg_Maya(2).pdf?sequence=3|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subscribers were composers, teachers, performers or libraries located in North America and Europe. The magazine was never subsided or funded by any institution.&lt;ref name="Austin_xii"&gt;Austin (2011), Douglas Kahn, ''Preface'', p.xii&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music content ==
Despite or thanks to its short existence, the scope of ''Source'' magazine appears both focused and wide ranging. Emerging from a rejection of formal concert performance and traditional music notation, ''Source'' also included [[performance art]] and [[sound poetry]] in its coverage of avantgarde graphic scores, therefore expanding the very definition of music. It welcomed veterans like [[Harry Partch]], [[Lukas Foss]], [[John Cage]] or [[Morton Feldman]], as well as young Turks of the avant-garde like [[Hugh Davies (composer)|Hugh Davies]] (b1943), [[Daniel Lentz]] (b1942) or [[Jerry Hunt]] (b1943).

Over the years, ''Source'' covered West Coast experimentalism of the 1960s ([[Gordon Mumma]], [[Robert Ashley]]) ; American Minimalism ([[Steve Reich]], [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]], [[Earle Brown]]) ; the birth of [[Sound Art]] as we know it ([[Alvin Lucier]], [[Max Neuhaus]], [[Annea Lockwood]]) ; improvised and indeterminate music (the ONCE Group, Musica Elettronica Viva, Toshi Ichiyanagi) ; [[Fluxus]] and performance art with [[Dick Higgins]] or [[Allan Kaprow]] ; European sound poetry with the [[Fylkingen]] affiliated artists or [[Bernard Heidsieck]] ; the British [[Systems music]] of [[Cornelius Cardew]], [[Howard Skempton]], [[Michael Parsons (composer)|Michael Parsons]] and [[Gavin Bryars]].

''Source'' also welcomed the use of advanced technology (electronic, video, communications) to expand music's scope.&lt;ref name="Romagny_33-48"&gt;Romagny (2011), p.33-48&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine published information on [[Don Buchla]]'s newly built synthesizer,&lt;ref name="Bernstein_163"&gt;Bernstein (2011), p.163&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nam June Paik]]'s first video experiments or Lowell Cross's video/laser light shows featured in issue #9, 1971.&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;Cross, web site, (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The trend was perfectly in synch with the Art &amp; Technology show&lt;ref name="Tuchman"&gt;Tuchman (1971), ''Report''&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], 1971, where contemporary artists were offered to partner with engineers and technicians of their choice.&lt;ref name="Antin_61"&gt;Antin (2011), p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specificities ==
* '''Themed issues''': Some issues of ''Source'' have overtly or underlying specific themes, like issue #3, January 1968, stressing the importance of groups in new music and including scores, interviews or essays by [[ONCE Group]], [[Musica Elettronica Viva]], [[Sonic Arts Union]] and New Music Ensemble ; issue #8, July 1970, is on concrete and sound poetry, with a report on the Swedish scene from the [[Fylkingen]] festival and venue, and other independent sound poets like [[Bob Cobbing]] and [[Henri Chopin]] ; issue #6, July 1969, is on Politics ; issue #9 (1971) features circuit diagrams ; issue #11 (1972) introduces Fluxus and intermedia.
* '''Guest editors''': a number of issues had guest editors who were invited to choose among the scores received by the magazine for possible inclusion, make their own suggestions of graphic scores to publish and bring their expertise on a specific field. [[Alvin Lucier]] included electronic experiments, in addition to the British Systems music forming the core of issue 10. [[Ken Friedman]] was asked to focus on Fluxus, performance and intermedia art in issue #11. John Cage took advantage of the skills of Source's resourceful printer, Doug Galbreath,&lt;ref name="Austin_2"/&gt; to create a version of ''Not Wanting To Say Anything About Marcel''&lt;ref&gt;See John Cage's Wikipedia [[John Cage#Visual art, writings, and other activities|article]]&lt;/ref&gt; printed on transparencies inserted in issue #7-8.
* '''Accompanying LP recordings''': several issues came with a pair of 10-inch records, a format chosen to fit with the magazine's format of nearly 11" x 14". These recordings collected sound works by artists included in the magazine with issues 4, 7/8 and 9. The two 10-inch LPs coming with issue #4 were subsidized by Columbia records, thanks to [[David Behrman]], an A&amp;R representative for Columbia in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Austin_xi-xii"&gt;Austin (2011), Douglas Kahn, ''Preface'', p.xi-xii&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spring Ice''''' is a 1915–16 [[oil painting]] by Canadian painter [[Tom Thomson]]. The work was inspired by a sketch completed on [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]] in [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]]. The completed canvas is large, measuring 72.0 × 102.3 cm (28⅜ × 40¼ in). Painted over the winter of 1915–16, it was completed in Thomson's shack behind the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] in [[Toronto]]. The painting was produced as he was in the peak of his short art career and is considered one of his most notable works. While exhibited in a show put on by the [[Ontario Society of Artists]], the work received mixed to positive reviews. In 1916 it was purchased by the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] and has remained in the collection ever since.

{{Further|Tom Thomson#Early recognition (1914–15)|Artistic development of Tom Thomson#Colour and experimentation (1914–15)}}

In the spring of 1915 Thomson returned to [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]] earlier than he had in any previous year.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}} In a letter to [[James MacCallum]], he reported that he had already painted twenty-eight sketches by 22 April.{{sfnb|Thomson|1915}}{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}} He became fascinated with the "opening of the waters" as the ice on the lakes began to melt. This ice is apparent in the sketch ''River'', which was likely painted early in the season and preceding ''Spring Ice''. The close of the day is indicated by the turquoise, yellow and lavender sky.{{sfnb|Murray|2004|p=112}}

The year overall was particularly productive for Thomson, himself reporting that he had painted 128 sketches by September. He began to more consistently use hard wood-pulp board for sketching, something he picked up from [[J. E. H. MacDonald]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}} From April through July, he spent much of his time fishing, assisting groups on several different lakes. He spent much of his summer travelling across the province, hunting and sketching.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=131}} From the end of September to mid-October, Thomson spent his time at Mowat,{{sfnb|Little|1955|p=205}} a village on the north end of Canoe Lake.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=102}} By November he was at Round Lake with Tom Wattie and Dr. Robert McComb.{{sfnb|Ghent|1949}}{{sfnb|Addison|Harwood|1969|p=46}} In late November Thomson returned to Toronto and moved into a shack behind the Studio Building that Harris and MacCallum fixed up for him,{{sfnb|Addison|Harwood|1969|p=84}}{{sfnb|Little|1970|p=179}} renting it for $1 a month ({{Inflation|CA|1|1915|fmt=eq|r=0|cursign=CAD$}}).{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=13}}{{efn|group=note|In his 1959 piece, "My Memories of Tom Thomson," [[Thoreau MacDonald]] (son of [[J.

''Spring Ice'' is among the dozen or so paintings expanded from a small sketch into a larger canvas work.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=181}} The smaller sketches were done [[en plein air]]—in this case likely painted a little north of Hayhurst's Point on [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]]{{sfnb|Saunders|1947|p=170}}{{sfnb|Little|1970|p=34}}—through the spring, summer and fall.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=59–60}} The larger canvases were instead completed over the winter in Thomson's studio—an old utility shack with a wood-burning stove on the grounds of the Studio Building, an artist's enclave in [[Rosedale, Toronto]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=127}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=181–85}}{{sfnb|Brown|1998|pp=151, 158}}

===Sketch (spring 1915)===

Curator Charles Hill has written that the ''Sketch for Spring Ice'' was almost certainly done with [[A. Y. Jackson]]'s 1914 canvas ''A Frozen Lake'' in mind.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}}{{efn|group=note|Under the National Gallery of Canada, Jackson's painting is instead known as ''Frozen Lake, Early Spring, Algonquin Park''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A. Y. Jackson: Frozen Lake, Early Spring, Algonquin Park |url=https://www.gallery.ca/collection/artwork/frozen-lake-early-spring-algonquin-park |website=www.gallery.ca |publisher=National Gallery of Canada |accessdate=11 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curator Charles Hill has noted that this is a common mistake arising due to the two paintings ''A Frozen Lake'' and ''Early Spring, Algonquin Park'' being exhibited next to one another in 1914. ''Frozen Lake, Early Spring, Algonquin Park'' is a combination of the two titles.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|loc=p. 130n107}}}} Thomson likely saw the painting in November 1914 before Jackson took it away in December to be exhibited.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|loc=p. 130n107}} The composition recalls Thomson's earlier work from his design career, using a group of trees in the foreground to establish a lake and low-lying hills in the background.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=71}} By 1914 Thomson was displaying an increasing interest in the motifs of both ice breaking up on a river as well as rock in the lower foreground. In these earlier examples, the foreground tends to cut a diagonal across the painting while the trees subtly obscure the far shore. A. Y. Jackson experimented with this idea in his own 1914 painting, ''Lake Shore, Canoe Lake''.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=125}} In the ''Sketch for Spring Ice'', a gentler rise to the left instead establishes the foreground with only a few brushstrokes used to paint the brown ground. Charles Hill has further written that, "the relationship of foreground, middle and distance is more fluid than in ''[[Northern River (painting)|Northern River]]'', opening the view of the water and far shore."{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}}

===Canvas (winter 1915–16)===

The final canvas for ''Spring Ice'' shares similarities to ''In the Northland'', another work produced over the same winter. A key difference is that ''Spring Ice'' emphasizes the horizontal, seen with both the foreground, lake and hills existing in bands stacked on top of one another, and further emphasized by the open space and the trees being placed on the far left and right of the foreground.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=135}}

While the sketch utilizes "muddy, warm tones," the canvas instead uses brighter, more highly keyed colours. The brighter greens, pinks, yellows, blues and whites are not too striking, with a pale blue lightly put on top of the final work to lower the overall contrast. The different regions of colour are readily apparent within the foreground. In the background, [[Terra cotta (color)|terra cotta]] is painted over with blue.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=135}}

==Provenance and exhibition==
In March and April 1916 Thomson exhibited ''Spring Ice'' and three canvases with the [[Ontario Society of Artists]] (OSA). The other paintings were ''In the Northland'' (at that time, titled ''The Birches''), ''Moonlight'' and ''October'' (then titled ''The Hardwoods''), all of which were painted over the winter of 1915–16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Murray |first1=Joan |title=Exhibition: 1916 OSA |url=http://tomthomsoncatalogue.org/exhibitions/entry.php?id=149 |website=tomthomsoncatalogue.org |accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=136}} Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the [[National Gallery of Canada]] wanted to purchase ''In the Northland'', but Montreal trustee Dr. Francis Shepherd convinced them to instead purchase ''Spring Ice.''{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=136}} They bought it for $300 ({{Inflation|CA|300|1916|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=CAD$}}).{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=13}}{{sfnb|Murray|2002b|p=316}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=47}}

Reception to Thomson's paintings at this time were mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]'' wrote, "Mr. Tom Thomson's 'The Birches' and 'The Hardwoods' show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper."{{sfnb|Fairbairn|1916}} A more favourable take came from artist [[Edmund Wyly Grier|Wyly Grier]] in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'': {{quote|Tom Thomson again reveals his capacity to be modern and remain individual. His early pictures—in which the quality of naivete had all the genuineness of the effort of the tyro and was not the counterfeit of it which is so much in evidence in the intensely rejuvenated works of the highly sophisticated—showed the faculty for affectionate and truthful record by a receptive eye and faithful hand; but his work today has reached higher levels of technical accomplishment. His ''Moonlight'', ''Spring Ice'' and ''The Birches'' are among his best.{{sfnb|Grier|1916}}}} In ''The Canadian Courier'', painter [[Estelle Muriel Kerr|Estelle Kerr]] similarly spoke positively, describing Thomson as "one of the most promising of Canadian painters who follows the impressionist movement and his work reveals himself to be a fine colourist, a clever technician, and a truthful interpreter of the north land in its various aspects.{{sfnb|Kerr|1916|p=13}}

'''''The Ant Bully''''' ({{ISBN|0590395912}}) is a 1999 [[children's book]] drawn and written by [[John Nickle]]. It is about a young boy named Lucas Nickle (also known as Peanut the Destroyer), who is the [[title character]] in the book and who likes to torment [[ant]]s. It was later adapted into a [[The Ant Bully (film)|computer-animated film of the same name]] by [[John A. Davis]], produced by [[Legendary Pictures]] and [[DNA Productions]] for [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].

==Story==
Lucas is a boy who is perceived as "strange" by his peers due to his funny glasses and propeller beanie (hat). Sid, the neighborhood bully, continuously bullies Lucas by spraying him with a water hose and stealing his hat. In an attempt to cope with Sid's actions, Lucas projects his anger onto a local colony of ants by spraying them with water, just as Sid has done to him.

The ants have enough and tackle and shove Lucas into the queen's chamber, and the queen confronts him about all of the trouble he has caused the colony. When Lucas is too shocked to even respond to her, the queen takes it as an insult, and orders an ant wizard to shrink the boy down to the size of an ant and take him to trial, where the judge declares him guilty. His punishment is to work hard like an ant, working in the field, gathering food, defending the colony from wasps and spiders, and taking care of the queen, the worst part of his punishment.

After a while, the queen tells Lucas that he has one last test to be set free: he must go home and bring her a Red Sweet Rock (jelly bean). Lucas brings two ants with him on the journey, and they ask him what it's like being a giant. Lucas tells them that he isn't a giant and gets picked on by Sid, who does all the same things Lucas does to the ants. When they reach his house, they find a box of swell jells, but Lucas's father sees the ants and tries to smash them with a fly swatter. Lucas shouts at his dad to stop, helping the ants to escape. Meanwhile, the queen is upset, fearing that Lucas was killed, but to her surprise he returns, and as promised she gives him the potion to return him to his right size. Lucas falls asleep and wakes up to see Sid, only to his surprise the ants got to him first and shrunk him as revenge.

The '''''Great Executioner''''' is a [[mezzotint]] by the soldier and amateur artist [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] (1619-1682), finished in 1658.

The subject of the picture is the execution of [[John the Baptist]], after [[Jusepe de Ribera]]'s painting. Rupert had become interested in mezzotint design during his time in Europe during the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]] following the [[English Civil war|English civil war]], and there is an extensive debate over Rupert's role in the invention of the technique itself.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, p.251.&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert's mezzotint works were popularised by the print collector [[John Evelyn]] after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], and became much admired across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, p.252.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Great Executioner'' is generally considered to be one of Rupert's finest works; produced in 1658, it is still regarded by critics as containing 'brilliance and energy',&lt;ref&gt;Hind, p.263.&lt;/ref&gt; 'superb', 'one of the greatest mezzotints',&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'among the finest [mezzotints] ever produced'.&lt;ref&gt;Hulton, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert's name can be seen signed along the executioner's blade.

'''Theatre and disability''' is a subject focusing on the [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] of disability within a theatrical experience. Disability may be included as the subject of a theatrical work, or represented in a character. There have been great debates concerning the portrayal of the sensitive subject matter, and whether or not enough research and compassion has been taken into consideration.

Disability in the theatre has been a prevalent and sensitive topic for centuries. More often than not, a theatrical production will choose to either exclude the use of disabled actors in a role of a character without any limitations. There are also cases where characters are written without any disabilities. Millions of patrons attend the theater each year, allowing them to gain insight and become educated on various social and political topics. Without the inclusion of disability in the arts, millions of people feel distanced or neglected from the remainder of society. There have been different forms of [[expressive therapy]], more specifically [[drama therapy]], as a form of therapy where people use dramatic tools to comfort and improve physical and mental health. Although found beneficial, it does not take the place of artistic achievement that people with disabilities strive for.

==Inclusion of disabled characters in theatrical works==

===Tennessee Williams===

In ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', Tennessee Williams explains to the readers that the character Laura has grown up with a disability.  
"A childhood illness has left her crippled, one leg slightly shorter than the other, and held in a brace. This defect need not be more than suggested on the stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Tennessee|title=The Glass Menagerie|year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; This character description is vague enough to allow the director of this production to make their own decision as to how they want to portray Laura. There is enough ambiguity for the director to take the responsibility of showcasing disability as they see fit.

[[Blanche DuBois]], a character in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', is unable to find inner happiness and fails to see the true beauty that she embodies. Because of this, she relies on the male figure for temporary fulfillment. This could be due to the extreme loss she has experienced in her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Tennessee|title=A Streetcar Named Desire|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Belluso===

The late John Belluso is an American playwright known for his work focusing on what its like living in society with a disability. Similar to many of his characters, Belluso was diagnosed with a rare bone disorder, causing him to live in a wheelchair for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schou|first=Solvej|title=Disabled Playwright John Belluso Dies|year=2006|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/disabled-playwright-john-belluso-dies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gretty Good Time'' is a play that centers around a woman suffering from post-polio paralysis. The audience rides the journey with Gretty as she is transported to a state institution where she will soon be unable to function on her own, therefore making her contemplate assisted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|title=A Caregiver Not in a Giving Mood|year=2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/theater/reviews/13rules.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 play ''[[The Rules of Charity]]'' is a story about Monty, a man living with [[cerebral palsy]] who uses a wheelchair. His daughter Loretta acts as his caretaker, and much of the play focuses on her relationship with her father and what it is like trying to balance her life as well as her fathers.

===Mike Lew===

Asian-American playwright Mike Lew recreates the famous tale of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III]]'', the most famous disabled and deformed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Katherine|title=Enabling Richard: The Rhetoric of Disability in Richard III|year=2016|url=http://www.mikelew.com/news/teenage-dick-vaguely-from-richard-iii-at-the-public}}&lt;/ref&gt; character written in history, in his play ''Teenage Dick''. The play centers around sixteen year old Richard, whose goal is to become senior class president. Richard suffers from cerebral palsy, and the audience learns the tribulations of trying to overcome heavy obstacles in a cut throat environment. ''Teenage Dick'' was performed at the [[Public Theatre]] in [[New York City]] in early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Teenage Dick (vaguely from Richard III)" at the Public|year=2009|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/997/1181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations supporting disabled artists==

===Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts===

The Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts supports and promotes the inclusion of disabled people in all realms of performing and fine arts. Through various programming, Inclusion in the Arts aims to increase diversity throughout the United States.

"Our principal aim is to achieve full inclusion in American arts and entertainment, such that what we see on our screens and stages truly reflects the society in which we live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts is supported by several national associations including The Shubert Foundation, [[Actors' Equity Association]], and the [[Screen Actors Guild]].

===Broadway Accessibility Initiative===

In 2012, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musicals ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Newsies (musical)|Newsies]]'' partnered with the Broadway Accessibility/Audience Expansion Initiative and Inclusion of the Arts to allow people with disabilities to receive the same theatrical experience as those without. The services now being provided are I-Caption for those who are deaf and hard of hearing, and D-Scriptive for blind audience members. ''The Lion King'' became the first autistic friendly performance in 2011.

===Deaf West Theatre===

[[Deaf West Theatre]] put on a production of ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Spring Awakening]]'' that premiered in Los Angeles, California and later transferred to Broadway in 2015.

{{quote
|"To me, the play speaks to those who are denied a voice, to those who don't fit into the norm, to those who are questioning and experiencing the pains of growing up."|Director Michael Arden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Signs of the Times: 'Spring Awakening' at Deaf West|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nearly half of the actors were deaf in this production. This new adaptation shed light on the power of disabled actors in the theater.

===Disability Art and Culture Project===

The aims of Disability Art and Culture Project is to support and advance artistic interest of those with apparent and non-apparent disabilities. In support of their mission statement, the DACP advocates for the artistic and creative interests of those who are disabled.

===National Theater of the Deaf===

Starting in 1967, the National Theater of the Deaf began producing shows with both [[Spoken Word]] and [[American Sign Language]]. This allowed the shows to bring in a larger audience, giving them the capability to challenge the way the audience members use their senses. This new type of theatre broke barriers as it incorporated a new form of language into the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King, Fahy|first=Kimball, Tom|title=Peering Behind the Curtain: Disability, Illness, and the Extraordinary Body in Contemporary Theatre|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==An audience's perspective==

There have been several debates as to who should portray characters with disabilities. Should actors with similar disabilities play the character, or should unlimited actors portray the character after having done substantial research? Is it morally and ethically correct for a non-disabled actor to personify a physical impaired character? Directors have two options to consider when deciding which actor should play a disabled character. To expose the world what they are already experiencing, or to a show a world with deeper dynamics and diversity.

Within the Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts, disabled actors are often asked to submit their headshot and resume, and it is ultimately up to the creative time on how the wish to portray disabled characters. Without an advocate for people with disabilities, oftentimes they go unnoticed when casting a production. According to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ([[GLAAD]]) in 2013, out of the 796 regular characters on broadcast primetime, only one percent was depicted as people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Where We Are on TV Report 2013|year=2013|url=http://www.glaad.org/whereweareontv13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple artists have used the '''Vitralism''' art movement in the last 10 years, see [https://www.flickr.com/groups/vitralism/pool/ Flickr group].

Vitralism is 21st-century [[art movement]] that uses broken color (similar to [[Impressionism]]) and line extension to achieve a "[[stained glass]]" look and effect. Light and dark colors are painted in many layers with round sponges (the kind used for a [[stencil]]) giving the broken color a transparent quality that simulates the light through a stained glass window. 
[http://www.meleflorez.com/attachments/contentmanagers/51/Woodpecker_full.jpg see example painting]. The background is done entirely with sponges. The subject may or may not be painted with sponges; brushes are used to paint the subject to create texture contrast.

Line extensions contribute to integrate the painted subject with its background. Acrylic paints are the preferred medium for its fast-drying quality, which prevents the mixing of colors on the canvas and keeps the colors almost pure and separated.

[https://www.flickr.com/groups/vitralism/pool/ Here are several photos of paintings created using this method]

The name Vitralism comes from the Spanish word [[:es:Vitral|"Vitral"]] which means stained-glass.  The word vitral comes from the [[Latin]] root [[:la:Vitrum|Vitrum]], which means [[glass]].

==Characteristics==
Some of the characteristics of Vitralism painting include: 
* Round-like strokes on the background and possibly on the subject
* Brush-applied strokes on the subject
* Dark extension lines
* Single subject
* Unity of color – each "piece" of the painting contains part of the color of its adjacent neighbor piece, particularly on the background
* Subjects from nature

==Beginnings==
While experimenting with acrylic colors for the first time, artist Mele Flórez Avellán started testing the paints on a masonite board. With a base of semi-gloss house paint, she started to apply color to her subject. To her discontent, the brush-applied strokes didn’t stick on the support the way she expected. It was not an opaque covering but semi-transparent. Since Mele already took the time to design her painting, she decided to look around her work area to see what could be used to make this a successful painting. Being a crafty person throughout her whole life, her work area was filled with all sorts of gadgets. She took a stencil sponge, dipped it in paint and lightly touched the support with the sponge. She liked what she saw. The addition of white, silver and gold paints gave the painting more light. The line extensions were then darkened to create a strong contrast.

==Techniques==
* Color is applied on the support with tapping movements, lightly touching the support, without dragging the sponges.
* Extension lines are painted with the edge of the round sponges in the same fashion.
* Light mixing of colors occur on the support to make the transition between colors.
* Varnish (gloss or semi-gloss) is applied to the painting when it is fully dry.

==Subjects==
Vitralism uses mainly subjects from nature, like birds, leaves and butterflies.

A '''Wildenstein Index Number''' refers to an item in a numerical system published in catalogues by [[Daniel Wildenstein]], a scholar of [[Impressionism]], who published [[Catalogue raisonné|catalogues raisonnés]] of artists such as [[Claude Monet]], [[Édouard Manet]] and [[Paul Gauguin]] through his family business, Wildenstein &amp; Company. In these catalogues, each painting by an [[artist]] was assigned a unique number. These index numbers are now used throughout the art world, in art texts, and on art websites to uniquely identify specific [[work of art|works of art]] by specific artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofmonet.com/Home_Page.htm|accessdate=October 9, 2007|publisher=artofmonet.com|title=Series and Themes (Home Page)  - Grain Stacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TUM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Lemonedes, Heather, Lynn Federle Orr and David Steel, ''Monet in Normandy,'' Rizzoli International Publications, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-8478-2842-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example is the ''{{Lang|fr|Monet: Catalogue Raisonné}}'' ({{ISBN|978-3-8228-8559-8}}), which is a four volume set published in 1996 with 2,580 illustrations in 1,540 pages. In this set, volume I is a [[biography]] and volumes II-IV contain a chronological listing of Monet's work; that is to say, volume II contains Wildenstein Index #1 produced in 1858 through #968 produced in 1885. The catalogue is produced with text in [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], and [[German language|German]]. The original version of this set was a five-volume black-and-white edition that has become [[collectible]] at costs of approximately U.S.$10,000 because it was originally only available to large [[museum]]s or major [[universities]]' art departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/3822885592|accessdate=October 9, 2007|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|title=Monet: Catalogue Raisonné [BOX SET] (Hardcover)|author=Wildenstein, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original black-and-white version was published in 1974 in four volumes and had a 1991 supplementary volume of additional paintings as well as drawings and pastels.  The 1996 revised edition in multiple languages does not include pastels, drawings, letters or footnotes from the original edition. Thus, the original is the most valuable resource for scholars.&lt;ref name=TUM&gt;Ganz, James A. and Richard Kendall, ''The Unknown Monet: Pastels and Drawings,'' 2007, Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, {{ISBN|978-0-300-11862-9}}, p. XI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;However, this gives the foundation an effective monopoly over deciding whether a work of art is a genuine Monet, or not. This has been called into question, as the Wildensteins are free to disregard the opinions of art experts and art historians worldwide if they so choose (as discussed in the BBC programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' broadcast by the [[BBC]] on June 19, 2011 referring to the painting ''{{Lang|fr|[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]}}'').  See: {{Cite episode| title = Monet| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125bz7| accessdate = August 4, 2011| series = Fake or Fortune? | network = [[BBC]] | airdate = June 19, 2011| number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most of the catalogues are published with Daniel as the author, other members of the five-generation family business were also responsible for promulgating this numbering system.  Daniel's father Georges Wildenstein published catalogues raisonnés for [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0571093140|accessdate=October 9, 2007|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|title=Chardin: catalogue raisonne|author=Wildenstein, Georges}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J2VI3W|accessdate=October 9, 2007|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|title=The Paintings of Fragonard: Complete Edition with a Catalogue Raisonné and 350 Illustrations|author=Wildenstein, Georges}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His son, Alec, has published a catalogue for [[Odilon Redon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/2850472468|title=Odilon Redon: Catalogue Raisonne|author=Wildenstein, Alec|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|accessdate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
