The '''Association for the Defence of the Memory of Marshal Pétain''' (''Association pour défendre la mémoire du maréchal Pétain'' or ''ADMP'') is a French association set up on 6 November 1951 under the patronage of general [[Maxime Weygand]], its honorary president until his death in 1965.

==History==
It was the successor to a "comité d'honneur", set up in 1948 by Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] to campaign for his release from prison and quickly banned. This group was presided over by the historian [[Louis Madelin]].&lt;ref name="yup"&gt;Richard Vinen, ''Bourgeois Politics in France, 1945-1951'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The new group was established in 1951 following Petain's death and was effectively led by prominent Vichyist lawyer [[Jacques Isorni]] who was the driving force behind the group,&lt;ref&gt;James Shields, ''The Extreme Right in France: From Pétain to Le Pen'', Roultedge, 2007, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; with Weygand's presidency of the group largely symbolic.&lt;ref name="yup"/&gt; The group published a monthly journal, ''Le Marechal''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Mammone, ''Transnational Neofascism in France and Italy'', Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---Le premier président de l'ADMP fut le [[Pierre Héring|général Héring]], jusqu'en 1960. Lui succèdent Jean Lemaire, l'un des avocat de Pétain, jusqu'en 1968, le général Lacaille, chef d'état-major du général Huntziger, de 1968 à 1973, l'amiral Auphan, de 1973 à 1976, puis trois anciens ministres de Vichy, Jean Borotra, Georges Lamirand, François Lehideux, chacun pendant 4 ans.

L'ADMP est une association de notables, qui a regroupé la plupart des anciens collaborateurs de Pétain pendant l'Occupation. De 1951 à 1971, on relève parmi le comité directeur 36 officiers supérieurs, 22 anciens ministres, 12 académiciens, des préfets.

Le comité d'honneur comprenait notamment les académiciens [[Henry Bordeaux]], [[Louis Madelin]], [[Claude Farrère]], [[Jérôme Tharaud]], les généraux [[Charles Brécard]], Dufieux, d'Harcourt, Lafont, [[Joseph de La Porte du Theil]], Laure, Pujo, [[Bernard Serrigny]], de même que des personnalités telles que [[Gaston Bergery]], [[Jean Borotra]], [[Jérôme Carcopino]], [[Pierre-Étienne Flandin]], [[Daniel Halevy]], [[Henri Massis]], [[Pierre Mauriac]], [[François Piétri]], [[Henry Lémery]], [[Louis Rougier]], [[Pierre Taittinger]], [[Jacques Isorni]], [[Gilbert Renault]] (le colonel Rémy), membre dès 1951.

L'ADMP poursuit trois objectifs. La révision du procès de Pétain tout d'abord, sous la direction de l'avocat Jacques Isorni. La translation des cendres de Pétain à l'ossuaire de Douaumont ensuite. Et enfin la réhabilitation du maréchal, ainsi que des valeurs de la Révolution nationale, sous le couvert de la "réconciliation nationale". les dirigeants et les membres de l'assocation peuvent être divisés en deux groupes : les antigaullistes, menés par Jacques Isorni, qui ne pardonnent pas l'épuration et la politique algérienne du général de Gaulle, et les pétaino-gaullistes, comme par exemple le colonel Rémy.

L'organe principal de l'association est ''[[Le Maréchal (revue)|Le Maréchal]]''. À cette publication s'ajoute, en 1972, ''[[La Voix du Maréchal]]''. Le 14 novembre 1951, le député socialiste [[Daniel Mayer]] dépose une proposition de résolution « tendant à inviter le Gouvernement à faire rechercher si l'association pour défendre la mémoire du Maréchal Pétain ne poursuit pas un objet illicite contraire aux lois et à la justice ce qui justifierait sa dissolution »,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.assembleenationale.fr/histoire/biographies/IVRepublique/mayer-daniel-29041909.asp Biographie de Daniel Mayer] sur le site de l'Assemblée nationale &lt;/ref&gt; qui ne sera finalement pas retenue.

Chaque année, des anniversaires rythment l'activité de l'association et induisent des pélerinages : le 24 avril, anniversaire de la naissance de Pétain, le 1er mai l'anniversaire de la Charte du travail, le 23 juillet, date de la mort de Pétain à 95 ans, pélerinage à l'île d'Yeu, le 11 novembre.

Située à [[Paris]], l'ADMP existe toujours aujourd'hui et continue à militer pour la révision du procès de 1945. Depuis 2000, elle est présidée par [[Jacques Le Groignec]]. Après avoir été condamné en 1993 par la [[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]] pour « apologie de crime de guerre » pour une publicité de l'ADMP parue dans ''[[Le Monde]]'',&lt;ref&gt; Jean-Pierre Le Crom, [http://www.reds.msh-paris.fr/publications/revue/html/ds038/ds038-04.htm#_ednref35 Juger l'histoire], ''Droit et Société'', n°38, 1998 &lt;/ref&gt; l'association obtiendra gain de cause devant la [[Cour européenne des droits de l'homme|CEDH]] en septembre 1998, celle-ci estimant qu'il y avait eu violation l'[[Convention européenne des droits de l'homme#Article n° 10 : droit à la liberté d'expression|article 10]] de la [[Convention européenne des droits de l'homme]], relatif à la liberté d'expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.85.135.104/search?q=cache:QYOlIMpiXZ0J:www.upf.edu/dret/orbis/france.doc CEDH, Lehideux et Isorni c.

He spent months recovering from the accident.  Following his recovery, Ali attended four separate universities before earning his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Due to [[Islamic]] prohibitions against consuming pork, Ben Ali never consumed some of his restaurant's popular offerings.&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;

[[Man vs. Food]] - S02E12 - Washington, DC was made in tribute to him.

'''Caiseal Mór''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|ʃ|əl}}) ( Cash-el More ) is an Australian sci-fi and fantasy novelist, artist and musician. His name is an Irish Gaelic idiom for "great stone fort”. Ancient Celtic Folklore has been a major inspiration for his thirteen published Fantasy novels. Mór also composes and records music, having produced seventeen albums since 1995. He is well known for his self-designed book and album covers and his intricate artworks in both traditional and digital mediums. Since 2013 he has been developing a distinctive graphic art style and creating digital sculptures in 3D.

==Life and career==
As a child, Mór was diagnosed on the autism spectrum as a savant. This was discussed in his autobiography A Blessing and a Curse; Autism and Me (2007). In his autobiography he writes about the profound difficulties he had as a child with conformity and the judgement of others. 

In his early twenties Mór left Australia to travel through India, Europe and North Africa. On this journey he met musicians and yogis from the Hindu and Sufi traditions. At this time he developed an obsession for non-Western music and instruments. In Turkey he was introduced to the Yayli Tanbur - an instrument that continues to feature in his musical compositions.

After returning to Australia in 1986 Mór was encouraged by friends to audition for the Performing Arts degree programme at the University of Western Sydney ( Theatre Nepean ) in 1987. He graduated in 1990 and moved straight into teaching drama and art in the Catholic education system. In late 1993 he resigned his teaching position and within months had signed a contract for his first novel: “The Circle and The Cross”.
A few distinct themes recur throughout Mór's novels. He focuses on an examination of religion versus spirituality, gods, deities and spirits, magic and technology. He also questions the basis of authority and the focus of western culture on conformity. Most of his stories are set in early medieval Ireland and Scotland. They feature a personal interpretation of the Celtic Otherworld. The concept of the Celtic Otherworld is expanded upon in his soon to be published Science Fiction works in which the setting is a series of alternative dimensions.

Mór is currently working on a series of graphic novels with all original artwork and design created by him under the title “[http://www.veilofthegods.com Veil of the Gods]”. In the last few years he has released a few artworks hinting that this major digital work will incorporate a musical score, animation and may be developed into a motion picture or television series.

Mór began creating musical art objects at university and later moved on to building shamanic style and tribal drums. After a journey to Mongolia in 2015 Mór began building shamanic style drums based on traditional Mongolian designs.
Since 1999 Mór has toured Australia and the world offering unique musical experiences based on his exposure to Eastern traditions. Since 2012 he has collaborated with the singer and multi-instrumentalist, Laya Rocha, on a series of all night concerts known as the Dreaming Deep. These events are based on Hindu and Sufi trance practices. All the music is improvised. The audience is encouraged to drift into sleep as the concert progresses toward dawn.

'''The Carver''' is a fictional character on the television show ''[[Nip/Tuck]].'' Introduced during the second season, he became the primary [[antagonist]] of the third season.

== Background ==
The Carver is introduced in the episode "Naomi Gaines" as a masked [[serial rape|serial rapist]] who [[Glasgow smile|disfigures]], [[rape]]s, and/or kills his victims, though he has killed only one victim: Rhea Reynolds, a woman who faked being attacked by the Carver so she could get free plastic surgery. He becomes upset after [[Sean McNamara (Nip/Tuck)|Dr. Sean McNamara]] performs corrective [[plastic surgery]] on one of his victims.  He attacks McNamara in his bathroom and cuts one side of his face. He then threatens to kill McNamara if he "fixes" any more of the Carver's "masterpieces."  McNamara continues to do so, and in the second-season cliffhanger, the Carver exacts revenge by attacking and raping Dr. Christian Troy, McNamara's associate. Before raping his victims, and/or carving their cheeks down to the lip to resemble a smile (a "[[Glasgow smile]]"), the Carver tells his victims, "Beauty is a curse on the world," sometimes adding, "It keeps us from seeing who the real monsters are."

==Motives ==
The Carver apparently believes that [[Physical attractiveness|physical beauty]] is [[evil]] and feels compelled to destroy it.  He has referred to beauty as a type of prison or cage that people are trapped in and believes it necessary to free such a craftsman's pride in his or her work. He also considers his resulting disfigurements "art" – a new kind of beauty to grace the world.

'''Dr. Quentin Costa''', portrayed by [[Bruno Campos]], is ultimately revealed as Carver.

Quentin Costa is introduced in the episode "Sean McNamara" as a [[plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] from Atlanta, Georgia. He is brought in to assist [[Christian Troy]] in fixing [[Sean McNamara (Nip/Tuck)|Sean McNamara]]'s face (a slash to the right side of his face) after an attack by The Carver, a masked serial rapist preying on individuals who would ultimately become Sean and Christian's patients.

In the third season, Sean offers Quentin a limited partnership after Christian neglects to return to work after being attacked by the Carver. Initially, Christian refuses to accept having Quentin as an associate, but later changes his mind and supports the decision. A couple of episodes later, he and Sean go to a frat party together. They end up receiving fellatio from two college girls, during which Costa winks at Sean. This bothers Sean and he leaves the room. In the same episode Christian asks Costa to help take [[Kit McGraw]] off his hands because he is tired of the three-way relationship with her and [[Kimber Henry]]. While in bed with Kit on one side and Christian and Kimber on the other he reaches over and touches Christian's buttocks. Costa later explains that he is bisexual, and assumed Christian was as well. After Sean briefly leaves the practice, Costa remains to assist Christian with surgeries. Later Christian believes that Costa is on drugs and calls Sean to assist with the [[facial transplant]] surgery they are working on. Sean later returns to the practice.

Following Sean's return to the practice, both Costa and Sean admit their hatred for each other after the former enters a relationship with Sean's ex-wife [[Julia McNamara|Julia]]. After catching Costa having sex with a married male patient (a corporal), Sean blackmails him in an attempt to force him to quit the practice. Costa allows McNamara/Troy to buy out the rest of his contract at half price, only to then reveal he is staying in Miami to become the resident plastic surgeon at ''De La Mer'', under the employment of Julia McNamara. He is later fired after an argument with Julia.

When Julia discovers she is pregnant, Sean and Christian suspect that Costa is the father. This was later proven false, as Costa (never knowing Julia was pregnant) admits to Christian that they never had sex. The child is now assumed to be Sean's.

At the end of episode 3.14 ("Cherry Peck"), it is revealed that Costa does not have a penis. Early in the next episode he attributes this to a genetic disorder known as [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]] that he suffers as a product of [[incest]].

== Unmasking ==

[[Image:Quentin&amp;kit.jpg|thumb|The Carver unmasked; Quentin Costa and his co-conspirator/sister Kit McGraw]]

The third season's finale (Episode 3.15, "Quentin Costa") revealed the Carver to be [[Quentin Costa]], with assistance from his sister, [[Kit McGraw]].

=== Exegesis: Summary of Episode 3.15 ===

Detective Kit McGraw brings Dr. Quentin Costa in for questioning, suspecting him to be the Carver; she subsequently finds that, due to a medical condition, Costa was born with no [[human penis|penis]].  Since all of the Carver's victims were raped, Costa is released.

The Carver attacks a group of nine [[sorority]] girls. During questioning, one victim recounts walking in on the Carver raping her sorority sister, and was able to see that the Carver did not have a real penis, but rather was wearing a strap-on [[dildo]].

Kit and the police storm Costa's apartment only to find Costa tied to his bed, bearing the trademark cheek slashes of The Carver, and the message "I can't stop" written in blood on the wall behind him.

Once again exonerated from the suspect pool, Costa asks Christian and Sean to repair his face. After initially refusing, Christian and Sean agree to perform the surgery. During this conversation, Costa explains away some potential [[plot hole]]s from earlier in the season.  Specifically:

* When Sean witnessed Costa receiving [[oral sex]] at a college party, Costa explains how he paid the girl $100 to pretend to perform fellatio on him.
* When Costa was beginning to have 4-way sex with Christian, Kit and Kimber, he intentionally grabbed Christian's buttocks so he could end the session early and thus retain his secret.

During Costa's operation, Kit arrives with a [[S.W.A.T.]] team and arrests [[Liz Cruz (Nip/Tuck)|Liz Cruz]], McNamara/Troy's [[anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]], as the next prime suspect. During the interrogation, Kit explains the [[evidence]] against Liz:
* A [[search warrant]] of Liz's house led to the discovery of a strap-on dildo.
* A receipt for an order of the same drugs the Carver uses on his victims was found at McNamara/Troy with Liz's signature on it.
* Liz has been visiting numerous area [[spermatozoon|sperm]] banks and therefore could have obtained Christian's sperm and planted evidence that led to Christian's arrest as a suspect earlier in the season (it is known by the viewers that Liz received a sample directly from Christian in Season 2, but not mentioned by Kit). Liz attests her innocence during questioning.

Sean checks up on Quentin in recovery. Gina, carved but not dead, is the body in Quentin's bed — seen only by the audience. The Carver suddenly appears behind Sean, injects him with the paralyzing agent and unmasks — revealing himself to be none other than Quentin Costa.

Sean awakens to find both Christian and himself tied to separate operating tables. Costa cuts off Sean's pinky finger and attempts to force Christian to cut off his own hand. Just before Christian is about to do it, Kit arrives and shoots Costa in the back.  Kit tells paramedics to make sure the [[autopsy]] on Costa's body is not started without her.

At police headquarters, Kit explains to Christian and Sean that Gina (who was at the office to drop off a [[Christmas]] gift for Christian) called [[9-1-1]], which is why Kit showed up.  Kit then explains Quentin's life story.

Costa was born with [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]], a debilitating disease that left him with no penis. He also had a sister, Violet, who suffered severe facial disfigurement. Apparently both medical anomalies were a result of [[incest]]. After their parents abandoned them, the two lived in a [[convent]] in [[Maine]].  Quentin worked his whole life to become a [[plastic surgeon]] so he could fix his sister's face, but she died at the age of 29 during her final operation.

Kit leaves [[Miami]] after closing the case. While talking to Gina, Sean and Christian discover that Gina never called 911, as she was completely paralyzed after being attacked by the Carver.

In the [[morgue]], we see a body laid out covered by a sheet. A hand removes the sheet to reveal Quentin Costa, who opens his eyes and sits up, revealing a bullet-proof vest beneath his black suit. "What took so long?" asks Costa.

Christian and Sean take a [[Red-eye flight]] to Maine to visit the convent where Costa was raised. When they mention Violet's death, the Mother Superior is confused, explaining that Quentin's sister's name isn't Violet, it is Katherine; but Quentin always called her Kit. The Mother Superior then shows Sean and Christian a Christmas card that the pair sent her three years before, which includes a photo of Quentin and Kit.

The Carver storyline ends with Quentin and Kit relaxing at a luxury hotel in [[Málaga]]. Although Kit wants to take a brief vacation, Quentin is spurred on by the sight of a woman with [[breast implant]]s. The scene ends with a shot of the woman lying in a deck chair with Quentin and Kit's shadows hovering over her.

=== Correct guesses and a premature reveal===

Prior to the finale, a few fans were able to correctly guess the identity of the Carver through the use of sound-editing programs.  As a promotion for the show, FX set up a profile for the Carver on [[myspace.com]], which included videos of the Carver espousing his philosophy.  Within days, various tech-savvy audiophiles took the audio from these videos, filtered out the distortion from the Carver's voice synthesizer, and were able to reveal that at the very least, Campos was voicing The Carver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecarver.ytmnsfw.com/ YTMND - The Carver is revealed!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carver's identity was also leaked prematurely by none other than [[FX Networks]]. One day before the finale episode aired, the press section of the FX Networks website published three pictures which revealed the identity of the Carver. While the pictures were removed from the site later that evening, they had already been re-published on various fan-based message boards.

==Behind the scenes==

*The Carver's outfit is made by [[Prada]]. His top is a black zip-up sweater from the Winter 2004 collection.
* Three knives were used for filming: A sharp, shiny one used for scenes in which the Carver is just brandishing the knife; a dull one for when the Carver "slashes"; and a dull one with a built in blood tube to create a bleeding effect when the knife is pressed against skin (this prop was used in the Season 2 episode in which Sean is carved).
* There was only one Carver mask, custom molded from [[porcelain]] and [[resin]]. Because it was so fragile, a props manager was in charge of making sure it was handled properly every time it was on the set.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-12-19-niptuck_x.htm USATODAY.com - Unmasking 'Nip/Tuck' devil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bruno Campos wore brown [[contact lens]]es when playing the Carver to keep his blue eyes from being seen in the mask.
* [[Joely Richardson]] lost a $100 bet to Campos over the Carver's identity. Apparently, she couldn't believe it would be him.  He claims to have framed the cheque.

==Real-life similarities==
*The Carver's [[modus operandi]] is somewhat similar to the [[urban legend]] of the Smiley Gang, a group of six men who offered their victims the choice of being raped or having an "[[Glasgow smile|eternal smile]]" cut into their faces. This [[hoax]], predominantly spread by [[email]], spread fear among teens and their parents in both the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] in late 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblog.roelonline.net/archives/001016.php Roel's Weblog - Gerucht over 'smiley-bende' houdt politie bezig&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206140117/http://weblog.roelonline.net/archives/001016.php |date=2006-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference is that the Carver offered his victims no choice; he both cut and raped them.

==Early life==
Jackson was born at Deaconess Hospital in [[Spokane, Washington]], on July 12, 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheyennejackson.com|title=The Official Cheyenne Jackson website|publisher=Cheyenne Jackson|accessdate=2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to David and Sherri Jackson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://playbill.com/multimedia/gallery/cheyenne-jackson-and-nina-arianda-celebrate-new-years-eve-at-kennedy-center-6760/5 |title=Cheyenne Jackson and Nina Arianda Celebrate New Year's Eve at Kennedy Center website |publisher=Playbill.com |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027212547/https://playbill.com/multimedia/gallery/cheyenne-jackson-and-nina-arianda-celebrate-new-years-eve-at-kennedy-center-6760/5 |archivedate=2014-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named by his father after the 1950s Western series ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]''.&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt; The third of four children, he was raised in [[Oldtown, Idaho]], a "teeny mill town" in a rural area in northern Idaho near the Washington border.&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt; His father was  [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.queerty.com/cheyenne-jackson-shows-off-giant-dead-tree-tattoo-addresses-sex-tape-in-new-interviews-20140425&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Vietnam veteran]].

His mother taught Jackson, his sister, and two brothers to sing and regularly played music by [[Joan Baez]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Elvis Presley]] at home. He moved to Spokane as a teenager.

In Seattle, Jackson worked as an ad executive at a magazine and did some theater work on the side, earning his [[Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] card.&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt; "As soon as I found out what theater was, what [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] was, I thought, 'Oh, that's what I'll do with my life.' Just a matter of getting all the pieces in place," he said.&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt; Inspired to rethink his career after the [[September 11 attacks]], he moved to [[New York City]] to pursue his dream of being an actor: "[Acting] was something I always wanted to do but I was too scared and didn't have the confidence. 9/11 changed everything for all of us. It gave me the urgency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/interview-cheyenne-jackson/Content?oid=2525852 |title=Interview: Cheyenne Jackson  |publisher=BestofNewOrleans.com |author=Will Coviello  |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=March 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, half of the Russian national team in wrestling were his disciples. The national team of Chechen-[[Ingushetia]], whose coach was D. Bagaev, achieved outstanding results in the Games of the Peoples of the USSR in 1979. Athletes have won then 4 gold, 1 silver and 3 bronze medals.

'''Eileen Jeanette Vancho Lyttle Garrett''' (17 March 1893 – 15 September 1970) was an Irish [[Mediumship|medium]] and [[Parapsychology|parapsychologist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Buckland]]. (2005). ''The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication''. Visible Ink Press. p. 157. {{ISBN|978-1578592135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett's alleged psychic abilities were tested in the 1930s by [[Joseph Banks Rhine|Joseph Rhine]] and others. Rhine claimed that she had genuine psychic abilities, but subsequent studies were unable to replicate his results, and Garrett's abilities were later shown to be consistent with chance guessing.&lt;ref name="Russell 1938"&gt;A. S. Russell, John Andrews Benn. (1938). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CgI-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=cards+soal+garrett&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u20SU7n4L4uUhQe5-YCgCw&amp;ved=0CEkQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=cards%20soal%20garrett&amp;f=false ''Discovery the Popular Journal of Knowledge'']. Cambridge University Press. pp. 305–306&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett elicited controversy after the [[R101]] crash, when she held a series of [[séance]]s at the [[National Laboratory of Psychical Research]] claiming to be in contact with victims of the disaster. [[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]], and others, investigated her claims, and found them to be valueless, easily explainable, or the result of fraud.&lt;ref name="Booth1986"&gt;[[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]]. (1986). ''Psychic Paradoxes''. Prometheus Books. pp. 164–165. {{ISBN|978-0879753580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris2003"&gt;Melvin Harris. (2003).

Prometheus Books. pp. 171–182. {{ISBN|978-1591021087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrett was married three times, and had four children. Garrett died after a long illness on 15 September 1970, in [[Nice]], France.&lt;ref name="Guiley1994"/&gt;

== Biography ==

Garrett was born in Beauparc, [[County Meath]] in Ireland on 17 March 1893.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence]]. (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology''. Kessinger Publishing. p. 366. {{ISBN|978-1161361827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents committed suicide and Garrett went to live with her aunt.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Klimo. (1987). ''Channeling: Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources''. Jeremy P. Tarcher. p. 154. {{ISBN|978-1556432484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett admitted she had a very unpleasant childhood and because of the anger of her aunt would "separate into a world of her own" where she could dissociate from her surroundings. She claimed to have developed [[psychic]] ability in her youth. She later married and claimed to hear voices and show symptoms of a [[dissociative identity disorder]]. Both Garrett and her husband believed she was on the "brink of madness", however, Garrett came to accept her condition and took up [[Mental mediumship|trance mediumship]].&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Hazelgrove. (2000). ''Spiritualism and British Society Between the Wars''. Manchester University Press. pp. 127–128. {{ISBN|978-0719055591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[psychologist]] [[Jan Ehrenwald]] wrote that Garrett's claims of psychic ability could easily be explained by "[[megalomania]]... ideas of grandeur" as she experienced mental [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], [[hallucination]]s and had an eccentric disposition from her childhood.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]]. (1986). ''Psychic Paradoxes''. Prometheus Books. p. 193. {{ISBN|978-0879753580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrett married three times. Her first marriage was to Clive Barry and they had three sons all of whom died young and a daughter, Eileen Coly who took interest in parapsychology.&lt;ref name="Guiley1994"&gt;[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Rosemary Guiley]]. (1994). ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits''. Guinness World Records Limited. pp. 132–133. {{ISBN|978-0851127484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett worked at a hostel for wounded soldiers during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Guiley1994"/&gt; In 1931 she was invited to the United States by the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] and performed experiments for various psychical researchers in both America and Europe until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Helene Pleasants. (1964). ''Biographical Dictionary of Parapsychology with Directory and Glossary 1946–1996''. New York: Garrett Publications. p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett was not a proponent of the [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] hypothesis and attributed her [[mediumship]] not to spirits but to the activity of a "magnetic field".&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Lewis. (1987). ''Confronting the Cults''. P &amp; R Publishing Company. p. 168. {{ISBN|978-0875523231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett wrote "In all my years' professional mediumship I have had no "sign", "test" or slightest evidence to make me believe I have contacted another world." She considered that her trance controls were personalities from her [[subconscious]] and admitted to the parapsychologist [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]] "I do not believe in individual survival after death".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]] . (1983). ''No Common Task: The Autobiography of a Ghost-Hunter''. George G. Harrap &amp; Co Ltd. p. 56. {{ISBN|978-0245539596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main trance controls of Garrett were known as "Abdul Latif" and "Uvani".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Cohen (children's writer)|Daniel Cohen]]. (1971). ''Masters of the Occult''. Dodd, Mead and Company. p. 211. {{ISBN|978-0396064077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 Garrett voluntarily submitted herself to an analysis by the psychologist [[William Brown (psychologist)|William Brown]] and by word-association tests by the psychical researcher [[Whately Carington]]. The tests had proven that her controls were secondary personalities from her subconscious, organised around repressed material.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hornell Hart]]. (1959). ''The Enigma of Survival''. Rider. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; The psychical researcher [[Hereward Carrington]] with his colleagues also examined the trance controls in many séance sittings. They utilised instruments to measure everything from [[Skin conductance|galvanic skin response]] to blood pressure and concluded from the results that the controls were nothing more than secondary personalities of Garrett and there was no [[spirit]]s or [[telepathy]] involved.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Aykroyd, Angela Narth and Dan Aykroyd. (2009). ''A History of Ghosts: The True Story of Séances, Mediums, Ghosts, and Ghostbusters''. Rodale Books. pp. 74–75. {{ISBN|978-1605298757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrett regarded her trance controls as "principles of the subconscious" formed by her own inner needs.&lt;ref name="Guiley1994"/&gt; She founded the [[Parapsychology Foundation]] in New York City in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Samuel. (2011). ''Supernatural America: A Cultural History''. Praeger Publishers. p. 64. {{ISBN|978-0313398995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrett founded the [[Creative Age Press]] publishing house, which she later sold to [[Farrar, Straus and Young]]. She also edited ''[[Tomorrow_(magazine)#Tomorrow,_mystical_magazine_(New_York,_1941–1960s)|Tomorrow]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Books, Writers | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7595633/creative_age_press_sold/ |newspaper=Independent Press-Telegram|date=July 1, 1951|page=9|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 25, 2016 | last=Keith | first=Joseph Joel}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrett died after a long illness on 15 September 1970, in [[Nice]], France.&lt;ref name="Guiley1994"/&gt;

== Clairvoyance tests ==

Garrett took part in "[[clairvoyance]]" tests. One of the tests was organized by [[Joseph Banks Rhine|Joseph Rhine]] at Duke University in 1933 which involved [[Zener cards]]. Certain symbols that were placed on the cards and sealed in an envelope, and participants were asked to guess their contents. She performed poorly and later criticized the tests by claiming the cards lacked a [[Energy (esotericism)|psychic energy]] called "energy stimulus" and that she could not perform clairvoyance to order.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Hazelgrove. (2000). ''Spiritualism and British Society Between the Wars''. Manchester University Press. p. 204. {{ISBN|978-0719055591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parapsychologist [[Samuel Soal]] and his colleagues tested Garrett in May 1937. Most of the experiments were carried out in the Psychological Laboratory at the [[University College London]]. A total of over 12,000 guesses were recorded but Garrett failed to produce above chance level.&lt;ref name="Russell 1938"/&gt; In his report Soal wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the case of Mrs. Eileen Garrett we fail to find the slightest confirmation of Dr. J. B. Rhine's remarkable claims relating to her alleged powers of extra-sensory perception. Not only did she fail when I took charge of the experiments, but she failed equally when four other carefully trained experimenters took my place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Soal]]. ''A Repetition of Dr. Rhine's work with Mrs. Eileen Garrett''. Proc. S.P.R. Vol. XLII. pp. 84–85. Also quoted in [[Antony Flew]]. (1955). ''A New Approach To Psychical Research''. Watts &amp; Co. pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
   
The experiments of Rhine and the Zener cards used in the 1930s were discovered to contain procedural errors and flaws, the results have not replicated when the experiments have been conducted in other laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Wynn, Arthur W. Wiggins. (2001). ''Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins''. Joseph Henry Press. p. 156. {{ISBN|978-0-309-07309-7}} "In 1940, Rhine coauthored a book, ''Extrasensory Perception After Sixty Years'' in which he suggested that something more than mere guess work was involved in his experiments. He was right! It is now known that the experiments conducted in his laboratory contained serious methodological flaws. Tests often took place with minimal or no screening between the subject and the person administering the test. Subjects could see the backs of cards that were later discovered to be so cheaply printed that a faint outline of the symbol could be seen. Furthermore, in face-to-face tests, subjects could see card faces reflected in the tester’s eyeglasses or cornea. They were even able to (consciously or unconsciously) pick up clues from the tester’s facial expression and voice inflection. In addition, an observant subject could identify the cards by certain irregularities like warped edges, spots on the backs, or design imperfections."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 122. {{ISBN|978-1573929790}} "The procedural errors in the Rhine experiments have been extremely damaging to his claims to have demonstrated the existence of ESP. Equally damaging has been the fact that the results have not replicated when the experiments have been conducted in other laboratories."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Alcock]]. (2011). [http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/back_from_the_future ''Back from the Future: Parapsychology and the Bem Affair'']. ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''. "Despite Rhine's confidence that he had established the reality of extrasensory perception, he had not done so. Methodological problems with his experiments eventually came to light, and as a result parapsychologists no longer run card-guessing studies and rarely even refer to Rhine's work."&lt;/ref&gt; Science writer [[Terence Hines]] has written "the methods used to prevent subjects from gaining hints and clues as to the design on the cards were far from adequate."&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 119–120. {{ISBN|978-1573929790}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Zusne]] and [[Warren Jones (psychologist)|Warren Jones]] wrote "the keeping of records in Rhine's experiments was inadequate. Sometimes, the subject would help with the checking of his or her calls against the order of cards. In some long-distance telepathy experiments, the order of the cards passed through the hands of the percipient before it got from Rhine to the agent."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Zusne, Warren Jones. (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Psychology Press. p. 158. {{ISBN|978-0805805086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

On 7 October 1930 it was claimed by spiritualists that Garrett made contact with the spirit of [[Herbert Carmichael Irwin]] at a [[séance]] held with [[Harry Price]] at the [[National Laboratory of Psychical Research]] two days after the [[R101]] disaster, while attempting to contact the then recently deceased [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], and discussed possible causes of the accident.&lt;ref name="Harris2003"/&gt; The event "attracted worldwide attention", thanks to the presence of a reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro-tongil.org/swedish/english/er101.htm |title=R101 |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major Oliver Villiers, a friend of Brancker, Scott, Irwin, Colmore and others aboard the airship, participated in further séances with Garrett, at which he claimed to have contacted both Irwin and other victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leasor |first=James |year=2001 |origyear=1957 |title=The Millionth Chance: The Story of the R.101 |place=London |publisher=Stratus Books |page=181 |isbn=978-0-7551-0048-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price did not come to any definite conclusion about Garrett and the séances:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not my intention to discuss if the medium were really controlled by the discarnate entity of Irwin, or whether the utterances emanated from her subconscious mind or those of the sitters.  "Spirit" or "trance personality" would be equally interesting explanations – and equally remarkable.  There is no real evidence for either hypothesis. But it is not my intention to discuss hypotheses, but rather to put on record the detailed account of a remarkably interesting and thought-provoking experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price]]. (1933). ''Leaves from a Psychist's Case-book''. Gollancz. p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1978, paranormal writer [[John G. Fuller]] wrote a book claiming that Irwin had spoken through Garrett.&lt;ref&gt;[[John G. Fuller]]. (1978). ''Airman Who Would Not Die''. Putnam Publishing Group. {{ISBN|978-0399122644}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim has been questioned. Magician [[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]] analyzed the mediumship of Garrett and the [[paranormal]] claims of R101 and considered her to be a fraud. According to Booth, Garrett's notes and writings show she followed the building of the R101 and she may have been given aircraft blueprints from a technician from the aerodrome.&lt;ref name="Booth1986"/&gt; 

However, [[Melvin Harris]] a researcher who studied the original scripts from the case, wrote that no secret accomplice was needed as the information described in Garrett's séances were "either commonplace, easily absorbed bits and pieces, or plain gobbledegook. The so-called secret information just doesn't exist."&lt;ref name="Harris2003"/&gt; Harris discovered that the original scripts of the séances did not contain any secret information and spiritualist writers such as Fuller had fabricated and misinterpreted content from these scripts. When experts and veteran pilots were shown the scripts they declared the information to be incorrect and technically empty.&lt;ref name="Harris2003"/&gt;  

Archie Jarman who had interviewed witnesses wrote an 80,000-word report on the case concluded the séance information was valueless and that we should "best forget the psychic side of R-101; it's a dead duck— absolutely!"&lt;ref name="Harris2003"/&gt;

'''Elizabeth Finch''', ''née'' Heneage, '''1st Countess of Winchilsea''' (9 July 1556 &amp;ndash; 23 March 1634) was an [[England|English]] [[Peerage|peeress]].

Elizabeth was the daughter and heiress of [[Thomas Heneage|Sir Thomas Heneage]], who was [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] and [[Vice-Chamberlain of the Household]] in the latter years of the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. At 16 years old, she was married to [[Sir Moyle Finch, 1st Baronet|Moyle Finch]] on 14 November 1572 and they had six children:

*[[Sir Theophilius Finch, 2nd Baronet|Theophilius]] (1573–1619), later 2nd Baronet.
*Heneage (born 1576, died young).
*[[Thomas Finch, 2nd Earl of Winchilsea|Hon. Thomas]] (1578–1639), later 2nd [[Earl of Winchilsea]].
*[[Heneage Finch (speaker)|Hon. Sir Heneage]] (1580-1631), later [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]].
*Hon. Francis, a barrister.
*Lady Catherine.

Her husband became a politician soon after their marriage and was [[knighthood|knighted]] in 1584 and given a [[baronet]]cy in 1611. When Sir Moyle died in 1614, Elizabeth and her sons made considerable efforts to have the family's status elevated and almost nine years later, [[James I of England|James I]] created her '''Viscountess Maidstone''', with a remainder to her heirs male. In 1628, she was further elevated by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] as '''Countess of Winchilsea'''. On her death in 1634, her titles passed to her eldest surviving son, Sir Thomas (who had already inherited his elder brother's baronetcy in 1619).

Elizabeth and Sir Moyle are depicted in repose in a monument commemorating members of the Finch family, sculpted by Nicolas Stone c. 1630. The piece was created after Sir Moyle's death during Elizabeth's lifetime, and is now displayed at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. It was originally in the church of [[St Mary's Church, Eastwell|St&amp;nbsp;Mary, Eastwell]], Kent, which became a ruin in the 1950s and is now owned by the [[Friends of Friendless Churches]].

'''Fausto de Elhuyar''' (11 October 1755 – 6 February 1833) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[chemist]], and the joint discoverer of [[tungsten]] with his brother [[Juan José Elhuyar]] in 1783. He was in charge, under a [[King of Spain]] [[Letters patent|commission]], of organizing the [[School of Mines]] in [[México City]] and so was responsible of building an architectural jewel known as the "[[Palacio de Minería]]".  Elhuyar left [[Mexico]] after the [[Mexican War of Independence]], when most of the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] residents in Mexico were expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall W. Brown, "Fausto de Elhuyar y Zúbice" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 2, p. 486. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Logroño]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja, Spain]] son of Basque-French parents from  [[Hasparren]], [[France]].
 
Between 1773 and 1777, Elhúyar studied medicine, surgery and chemistry, as well as mathematics, physics and natural history with his brother [[Juan José Elhuyar]] in Paris. After graduating, he returned to Spain, where he exercised himself in the study of mineralogy, specially that of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] and [[Navarre]], where he resided. In 1781, he was appointed a member of the ''[[Real Sociedad Bascongada de Amigos del País]]'' (''Royal Basque Society of Friends to the Country''), an enlightened institution thanks to which he started teaching as professor of mineralogy and metallurgy in [[Bergara]], the seat of both the ''Vascongada Society'' and the University of Vergara (nowadays merged with the [[University of the Basque Country]]). During those years, he published numerous articles and dossiers about minerals, ways to extract and purify them, etc., which made him famous throughout Europe as one of the top experts on the subject. In 1780, he started working in the ''Laboratorium Chemicum'' of Vergara along with François Chavaneau, with whom he was the first to purify [[platinum]]. After several months, he was the first person to discover and isolate [[tungsten]], of which he's credited, along with his brother Juan José, as its discoverer.  He also collaborated with [[Joseph-Louis Proust]], the famous French chemist at the service of king [[Charles IV of Spain]], who directed the ''National Laboratory'' in [[Segovia]].

In 1783, he visited several European universities, such as the School of Mines of Freiberg, at which he lectured on metallurgy and mine machinery; the [[University of Uppsala]], where he collaborated with [[Torbern Olof Bergman]]; and [[Köping]], where he visited [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], the one who announced Elhúyar's discovery of tungsten, and for some reason is credited for having made the discovery himself.

After his return to Spain, in 1785 he renounced his professorship and, in July 1786, was appointed General Director of Mines in Mexico. Before departing to his new office, he toured Europe again from 1786 to 1788 in order to study ''Born's method'' on refining silver. During this trip, he married Joan Raab in [[Vienna]], in 1787. For the next thirty three years, he resided in Mexico City, where the crown founded the capital's [[School of Mines]] (January 1, 1792), with Elhuyar as its first director. During his tenure, he commissioned and directed the construction of that institution's seat, the ''Palacio de Minería'', which was finished in 1813 and is considered one of the jewels of the Spanish American [[neoclassicism]]. He also visited and improved several of the existing Royal Mines of Mexico, dramatically increasing their productivity due to the introduction of new methods of exploitation. He aided [[Alexander von Humboldt]] during his time in New Spain, along with other mining experts then in Mexico, allowing Humboldt's section on mining in his ''Political essay on the Kingdom of New Spain'' to be replete with statistics and insights.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State, 1492-1867''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mexican Independence, he returned to Spain, where, due to his wide experience in modern minery methods, he was appointed Minister of Minery in 1822, and supervised the modern mining of the mines in [[Almadén]], [[Guadalcanal, Seville|Guadalcanal]], and [[Río Tinto]]. After falling from his ministry, he was appointed yet again General Director of Mines, and resumed his research activities in chemistry from this quieter office till his death in Madrid on January 6, 1833.

Graves has published widely in academic and mainstream publications. He has lectured at the [[Rotman School of Management]], the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Kennedy School at Harvard]], the [[University of Ottawa]], and the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nqi.ca/summit/bio.aspx|title=NQI Performance Excellence Summit  |publisher=[http://www.nqi.ca/ National Quality Institute]|accessdate=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3388">'''George Stevens Moore''' (April 1, 1905 &amp;ndash; April 21, 2000) was a chairman of [[Citigroup]] from 1967 to 1970.

==Biography==
Moore was born in [[Hannibal, Missouri]] and graduated from [[Yale University]] where he made money writing for the Yale Daily News and booking [[Broadway theatre|Broadway shows]] and tours to Europe for his classmates.

In 1927 he joined Farmers' Loan and Trust Company in New York City.  The bank would merge with First National City Bank.  He was President of Citibank (the predecessor to Citigroup) from 1959-1967 and later Chairman from 1967-1970.  He was succeeded by Walter B. Wriston who was President from 1967-1970. 

In 1963 Moore led an early effort by multinational corporations to create the world's first private investment company to promote the economic development of Latin America. This effort led to the formation of the [[Adela Investment Company]] in September 1964 and Moore served as a director.

Moore was President of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] Association in 1967 and dealt with financial problems as the company entered [[Lincoln Center]].  Cost-saving measures included raising ticket prices, delaying the season and eliminating free summer concerts in [[Central Park]].

Moore was the sole representative for financial interests of the [[Onassis family]] in the United States.

In 1987 he wrote "The Banker's Life" {{ISBN|0-393-33151-2}} detailing his experiences at the bank.

Mr. Moore was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1976.  He was awarded Meritous Service to [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626090116/http://www.seas.yale.edu/alumni-hall-detail.php?id=55 Yale Science &amp; Engineering Association - Hall of Achievement].

He died on April 21, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Leslie Kaufman |coauthors= |title=George Moore, 95, Ex-Banker Who Led Metropolitan Opera |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/22/business/george-moore-95-ex-banker-who-led-metropolitan-opera.html |quote=George S. Moore, a banker who led the overseas expansion of what became Citibank and steered the Metropolitan Opera through turbulent financial times, died yesterday at his home in Sotograde, Spain. He was 95. ... In addition to his son by his first marriage, Mr. Moore is survived by his second wife, Charon C. Moore; their three children, daughters Christina Sendagorta and Maria Pia and a son, Steven C. Moore, all of Madrid; five grandchildren; and a great-grandson. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=April 22, 2000 |accessdate=2012-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal Life==
He married his first wife, the Spanish-born Beatriz Bermejillo y Braniff, the Marquesada de Mohernando, in Mexico in 1938. From this marriage was born George Bermejillo Moore (1939-2015) who married Katharine Fairfax Lipson, descendant of the [[Schuyler family|Schuyler]], [[Van Rensselaer family|Van Renssalear]], and [[Bayard family|Bayard]] New York families.

'''Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos''' ({{circa|1580}}{{snd}}10 August 1621) was an English nobleman and courtier.

==Early life==

He was the only son of [[William Brydges, 4th Baron Chandos]], who died on 18 November 1602, and Mary Hopton, who was daughter of [[Sir Owen Hopton]]. He was M.P. for [[Cricklade (UK Parliament constituency)|Cricklade]], in 1597.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Brydges, Grey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brydges and his family were friendly with [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]]. His father visited Essex at [[Essex House (London)|Essex House]] on the Sunday morning (8 February 1601) of Essex's insurrection, but he was not deemed by the government to be implicated in the conspiracy. The son, Grey Brydges, was, however, suspected of immediate complicity, and was sent to the [[Fleet Prison]] with [[Henry Cuffe]] and others; but he was soon released.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Courtier and grandee==

Grey Brydges succeeded his father as '''[[Baron Chandos]]''' in 1602, attended King [[James I of England]]'s initial parliament on 19 March 1604, and was made [[Knight of the Bath]], when [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles Stewart]] was created Duke of York in January 1605. He visited [[Oxford]] with King James I, and was granted the degree of M.A. on 30 August 1605. On 2 July 1609, he was appointed keeper of [[Ditton Park]], Buckinghamshire, for life.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He attended the funeral of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], in 1612. Grey also took an active part in the court [[masque]]s and tournaments. It was reported at court on 9 September 1613 that a duel was to be fought by him and the King's favourite, [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Lord James Hay]]. He became [[Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire]] and was called the "King of the [[Cotswolds]]", owing to his generosity and his magnificent style of living at his residence, [[Sudeley Castle]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Chandos, Barons and Dukes of |display=Chandos, Barons and Dukes of s.v. John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos|volume=5|page=838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traveller==
In 1608 he went travelling with [[Degory Wheare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Wheare, Degory}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1610 he was appointed one of the officers under [[Sir Edward Cecil]] in command of an expedition to the [[Low Countries]], in the [[War of the Jülich succession]]. The [[Emperor Rudolph II]]'s forces were besieging [[Juliers]], and the English had combined with Holland and France to protect the town. [[Lord Herbert of Cherbury]] was Chandos's companion through this campaign. Chandos lodged at Juliers with [[Sir Horace Vere]], but does not seem to have taken much part in the fighting.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Afterwards he attended [[Antoine de Pluvinel]]'s academy in Paris, and then went to [[Blois]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoye, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

On 23 July 1612, Grey Brydges visited [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]] in the [[Low Countries]], for his health;&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; he had been there before during the Jülich campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Stoye, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 1616, there was some talk of making him [[President of Wales]], and on 8 November 1617, he was appointed to receive ambassadors from [[Muscovy]], then in England. His health was still failing, and after trying in 1618, the waters of [[Newenham Mills]] in Warwickshire, he returned to Spa, where he died suddenly on 10 August 1621, while taking in the waters there. His body was brought to Sudeley Castle, and buried there. An elegy for him was written by [[Sir John Beaumont]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==''Horae Subsecivae''==

Chandos has been regarded by [[Horace Walpole]] and others as the author of some essays, ''Horae Subsecivae''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; These were published by [[Edward Blount]], and from topical references would appear to have been written about 1615. The attribution is moot: [[Michael Lort]] and [[Samuel Egerton Brydges]] supported Walpole's view. [[Anthony à Wood]] and [[White Kennett]] had earlier stated that Gilbert Cavendish, eldest son of [[William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire]], was the author of the work. Copies are extant with the name of Lord Chandos inscribed on the title-page in seventeenth-century handwriting.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

[[Edmond Malone]] and [[Thomas Park (antiquary)|Thomas Park]], the editor of Walpole, attributed the book on the grounds of Gilbert's age to [[William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire|William]], a brother.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; A modern view agrees to the extent that 10 of the essays can be shown to have been written by William (for his father) in 1615, at a time when [[Thomas Hobbes]] was his tutor. (There is another view, which is that this collection is Hobbes's own work.) The published essays come as 12 shorter pieces (the 10 by William being among those); and four longer ones, now attributed one to William (on flattery, based on a piece from 1611) and three to Hobbes.&lt;ref&gt;A. P. Martinich, ''Hobbes: A Biography'' (1999), p. 37 and pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

On 28 February 1607, he married [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven|Lady Anne Stanley]], daughter of [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]] and [[Alice Spencer, Countess of Derby|Lady Alice Spencer]]. His wife Anne, a great-great-granddaughter of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]'s sister, Princess [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]], had been [[heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]] to the throne of England; she was, however, passed over for King [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]].

The couple had the following five children:

* Robert Brydges (b. 1611), died young.
* Anne Brydges (b. 1612): she did marry, reputedly to a Mr Torteson but little is known about her later life and whether there were any issue. Issue has never been ruled out, there is little firm evidence about her life after childhood.
* Elizabeth Brydges (1619–1678), married her stepbrother, [[James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven]].
* [[George Brydges, 6th Baron Chandos]] (1620–1654), married firstly, Lady Susan Montagu, daughter of [[Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester]]; married secondly, Lady Jane Savage, daughter of [[John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers]]. From both his wives, he had altogether six daughters, but no sons.
* [[Baron Chandos#Barons Chandos, second creation (1554)|William Brydges, 7th Baron Chandos]] (1621–1676), married Susan Kerr.  No issue.

'''Henry Bate''' or '''Hendrik Baten''' ('''of Mechelen''' or '''of Malines''') a.k.a. '''Henricus Batenus''' ('''Mechliniensis''')&lt;ref group="N"&gt;In all five languages that this English language Wikipedia inspected, the first name and family name may occur with or without mentioning his place of origin, and remarkably, apart from Dutch and rarely in Latin, the first name and origin can be found without his family name. In his native Dutch language and in German, the latter appears as either ''Baten'' or ''Bate''; in French and English the latter spelling clearly prevails. Hence in these languages he is referred to as ''Hendrik Bate[n] [van Mechelen]'', ''Heinrich [Bate[n]] von Mecheln'', ''Henri [Bate] de Malines'', and ''Henry [Bate] of Mechelen'' respectively although in particular in English, the French translation of his birthplace is equally common: ''of Malines'' (and in German one very rarely finds ''de Malines'' and once ''von Malines''). Texts in any language may show his Latinized name ''Henricus Batenus [Mechliniensis]''.&lt;/ref&gt; (24 March 1246 in [[Mechelen]] – after 1310 in [[Tongerloo]]) was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] philosopher, theologian, astronomer, astrologer, poet, and musician.

He was [[Master of Arts]] of the [[University of Paris]] before 1274. He was a pupil of [[Thomas Aquinas]], he became a canon and cantor of the [[Cathedral of Saint-Lambert]], [[Liège]] before 1289.

As astronomer, he made [[astrolabe]]s, and wrote ''Magistralis compositio astrolabii'', dedicated to his friend [[William of Moerbeke]]. He drew up astronomical tables: the ''Tabule Mechlinenses'', from around 1285-1295, and a 1290 work, ''De erroribus tabularum Alphonsi'', which pointed out errors in the [[Alfonsine tables]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = [[Karl Christian Bruhns]] | title = Baten, Heinrich | encyclopedia = [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]] | volume = 2 | year = 1875 | page = 132 | url = http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Baten,_Heinrich|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Rome in 1292, he wrote commentaries on the astrological works of [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] and [[Albumasar]].

He became tutor to [[Guy of Avesnes|Guy de Hainaut]], brother of Count [[Jean d'Avesnes]], for whom he wrote, between 1285 and 1305, a ''Speculum divinorum et quorundam naturalium'' (On the Unity of Natural).

Around 1309, he retired with the [[Premonstratensians]] of Tongerloo, where he ended his days.

==Biography==

===Voyage to France===
In the early 1790s, concerned at the likelihood of war between Britain and France, Matthews travelled to France with the radical [[David Williams (philosopher)|David Williams]] who was acquainted with such [[Girondist]]s as [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]] and [[Charles-François Lebrun, duc de Plaisance|Le Brun]]. Williams made efforts at mediation which failed, whereupon Matthews took the lead. He gained the trust of the French government for a short time.

On 2 June 1793 the Girondists were displaced by the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] and Matthews fell under suspicion for his Girondist associations and also because he was suspected of being a [[double agent]]. He was arrested and imprisoned for three years during the height of [[Reign of Terror|The Terror]] and was reportedly terrified of the guillotine, like all others. This lasted until 1796 when the French authorities concluded that he was a [[lunatic]] and released him.&lt;ref name="parmod"&gt;{{cite book | last = Trotter | first = David | authorlink = | author2 = | title = Paranoid Modernism: Literary Experiment, Psychosis, and the Professionalization of English Society | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2001 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-19-818755-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committal===
Returning to London, Matthews wrote two letters to [[Lord Liverpool]], in which he accused the [[Home Secretary]] of treason and complained about conspiracies directed against his life. After interrupting a debate in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] by shouting "Treason" at Lord Liverpool from the Public Gallery, he was arrested and held at [[Tothill Fields Bridewell]], a secure [[workhouse|house of correction]] in Tothill Fields, [[Westminster]] before being admitted to the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bethlem]] (Bedlam) psychiatric hospital on 28 January 1797.&lt;ref name="parmod"/&gt; Upon examination he declared that he had taken part in secret affairs of state (referring to his efforts in France), but had been betrayed and abandoned by [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]'s administration.&lt;ref name="nth"&gt;{{cite web | last = Jay | first = Mike | authorlink = | author2 = | title = The Air Loom Gang: James Tilly Matthews and his visionary madness | work = | publisher = Nthposition Magazine | year = 2003 | url = http://www.nthposition.com/theairloomgangjames.php | format = | doi = | accessdate = 31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1809 his family and friends petitioned for his release, on the grounds that he was no longer insane, but their petition was rejected by the Bethlem authorities. They therefore took out a suit of [[habeas corpus]] and two doctors, [[George Birkbeck]] and [[Henry Clutterbuck]] examined Matthews, declaring him sane. [[John Haslam (physician)|John Haslam]], the resident [[apothecary]] at Bethlem, begged to differ and maintained that Matthews' [[delusion]]s, particularly on political matters, rendered him a danger both to public figures and the general public.&lt;ref name="parmod"/&gt;

===''Illustrations of Madness''===
[[File:Illustrations of madness... Wellcome L0047393.jpg|thumb|right|Title page]]
In 1810 John Haslam produced the book ''Illustrations of Madness'' (original title: ''Illustrations of Madness: Exhibiting a Singular Case of Insanity, And a No Less Remarkable Difference in Medical Opinions: Developing the Nature of An Assailment, And the Manner of Working Events; with a Description of Tortures Experienced by Bomb-Bursting, Lobster-Cracking and Lengthening the Brain. Embellished with a Curious Plate'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Haslam | first = John | authorlink = John Haslam (physician) | author2 = | title = Illustrations of Madness | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1988 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-415-00637-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haslam intended to settle the dispute over Matthews' sanity; his book contains verbatim accounts of Matthew's beliefs and hallucinatory experiences and is considered the original description of the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Howard | first = Robert | authorlink = | author2 = | title = Psychiatry in pictures | work = | publisher = [[British Journal of Psychiatry]] | year = 2001 | url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/179/3/0 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book documented the first full study of a single psychiatric patient in medical history and has become a classic in the medical literature.

===The "Air Loom"===
[[Image:Airloom.gif|thumb|right|200px|Matthews's illustration of the Air Loom.]]Matthews believed that a gang of criminals and spies skilled in [[pneumatic chemistry]] had taken up residence at [[London Wall]] in [[Moorfields]] (close to Bethlem) and were tormenting him by means of rays emitted by a machine called the "Air Loom" or gaseous charge generator. The torments induced by the rays included "Lobster-cracking", during which the circulation of the blood was prevented by a [[magnetic field]]; "Stomach-skinning" and "Apoplexy-working with the nutmeg grater" which involved the introduction of fluids into the skull. His persecutors bore such names as "the Middleman" (who operated the Air Loom), "the Glove Woman" and "Sir Archy" (who acted as "repeaters" or "active worriers" to enhance Matthews' torment or record the machine's activities) and their leader, a man called "Bill, or the King".

Matthews' delusions had a definite political slant: he claimed that the purpose of this gang was espionage, and that there were many other such gangs armed with Air Looms all over London, using "pneumatic practitioners" to "premagnetize" potential victims with "volatile magnetic fluid". According to Matthews, their chief targets (apart from himself) were leading government figures. By means of their "rays" they could influence ministers' thoughts and [[Telepathy|read their minds]]. Matthews declared that William Pitt was "not half" susceptible to these attacks&lt;ref name="parmod"/&gt; and held that these gangs were responsible for the British military disasters at [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata#Second invasion - 1807|Buenos Aires]] in 1807 and [[Walcheren Campaign|Walcheren]] in 1809 and also for the [[Nore Mutiny]] of 1797.

In 1814 Matthews was moved to "Fox's London House", a private asylum in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], where he became a popular and trusted patient. His delusions appeared to have stopped. The asylum's owner, Dr. Fox, regarded him as sane. Matthews assisted with bookkeeping and gardening until his death on 10 January 1815.&lt;ref name="nth"/&gt;

==Significance of the Air Loom Gang affair==
Although it is impossible to make an unequivocal diagnosis of a person long since deceased, Matthews' description of his torment by the "Air Loom Gang" reads as a classic example of [[Paranoia|paranoid]] [[persecutory delusion]]s experienced as part of a [[psychotic]] episode. From this, it can be concluded that his disorder was most likely [[schizophrenia]], although retrospective diagnoses should be treated with caution.

It should also be noted that while Haslam kept notes on Matthews, Matthews kept notes on Haslam and his treatment in Bethlem. This formed part of the evidence looked at by the House of Commons 'Committee On the Better Regulation of Madhouses in England' in 1815, the findings of which led to Haslam's dismissal and reform of the treatment of patients in the Bethlem Hospital.

Matthews was also important in the history of psychiatry for more practical reasons. During his involuntary confinement he took part in a public competition to design plans for the rebuilding of Bethlem hospital. Bethlem's governors thought so well of the 46 pages of designs submitted by Matthews that they paid him £50 ({{Inflation|UK|50|1810|r=-1|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}} {{verify source|date=December 2013}} and the drawings finally used to build the new hospital show some features proposed by Matthews.&lt;ref name="parmod"/&gt;

==Fictional representations==
*''Haslam's Key'', a play written by journalist [[Danny O'Brien (journalist)|Danny O'Brien]] and performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] in 1993, imagined Matthews as a forerunner of modern science fiction authors. The titular "key" was a wooden spoon-like device invented by [[John Haslam (physician)|John Haslam]], the documenter of Matthew's delusions, which was used to force-feed Bedlam patients.
*Richard Hayden's novel ''The Influencing Engine'' (1996) is a fantasy loosely based on aspects of Matthews' life.
*In 2002, the British artist [[Rod Dickinson]] built a re-creation of the air loom from Matthews' original plans.
*[[Greg Hollingshead]]'s novel ''Bedlam'' (2004) concerns the changing relationship between John Haslam and Matthews and is narrated in first-person from the perspective of Haslam, Matthews, and Matthews' wife.
*The ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' episode "Lab Rats" (2007), [[Gil Grissom|Grissom]] uses Matthews' condition as an analogy in describing [[The Miniature Killer]], a [[serial killer]] obsessed with bleach.
*[[Robert Rankin]]'s 2007 novel, ''[[The Da-da-de-da-da Code]]'', features a group of villains known as the Air Loom Gang, as well as a doctor named Doctor Archy, a pub called "The Middle Man" and a beer called "King Billy".
* The first album from [[Aberystwyth]] band [[The Lowland Hundred (band)|The Lowland Hundred]] features a song called "The Air Loom", which references the affair.
* The game ''[[Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs]]'' from 2013 makes several references to both James Tilly Matthews, the Air Loom and Bedlam.
* Avant-garde black metal band Denizens released a 2013 EP titled ''On The Origins of the Influencing Machine'' directly referencing Matthews.

'''Jane Hamilton Hall''' (23 June 1915–November 1981) was an American physicist. During [[World War II]] she worked on the [[Manhattan Project]]. After the war she remained at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], where she oversaw the construction and start up of the [[Clementine (nuclear reactor)|Clementine nuclear reactor]]. She became assistant director of the laboratory in 1958. She was secretary of the General Advisory Committee of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1956 until 1959, and was a member of the committee from 1966 to 1972.

After working for a year as instructors at the [[University of Denver]], they joined the [[Manhattan Project]], the effort during [[World War II]] to develop [[atomic bomb]]s, at its [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name="The Atom"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Atom |volume=7 |issue=7 |date=July–August 1970 |title=Jane Hall to Receive AEC Citation |url=http://library.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/getfile?00847072.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepotism rules prevented them both working in the same groups together, so while David worked on [[nuclear reactor]] design, Hall was assigned to [[Herbert Parker (scientist)|Herbert Parker]]'s Health Physics group, where she soon became head of its Special Studies section. Parker had her investigate the safety aspects of reactors, and she researched the hazards of inhaling [[plutonium]].{{sfn|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|pp=43–45}}

Hall was seconded to [[DuPont]], where she became a senior supervisor at the [[Hanford Engineer Works]].&lt;ref name="The Atom" /&gt; Hall and David moved there in mid-1944, and supervised the construction of the [[B Reactor]] there, followed by the D and F Reactors.&lt;ref name="David Hall"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/david-halls-interview |title=David Hall's Interview |publisher=Manhattan Project Voices

But in November 1945, Hall and David accepted positions at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="David Hall" /&gt; This was at a low point for the remote laboratory; with the war over most of the scientists working there wanted to return to their universities and laboratories, and were leaving in large numbers.&lt;ref name="Scientists Not Political Sages" /&gt; But the laboratory was working on cutting-edge science.&lt;ref name="David Hall" /&gt; They were given the task of supervising the construction and commissioning of the [[Clementine (nuclear reactor)|Clementine nuclear reactor]].&lt;ref name="Clementine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bunker|first= Merle E. |title=Early Reactors From Fermi's Water Boiler to Novel Power Prototypes |journal=[[Los Alamos Science]] |date=Winter–Spring 1983 |pp=124–131 |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |url=http://library.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/getfile?00416628.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clementine was the world's first [[fast reactor]], the first to be fueled by plutonium, and the first to use a liquid metal coolant,&lt;ref name="The Atom" /&gt; in this case, [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name="Clementine" /&gt; It went [[Criticality (status)|critical]] in 1946, and was used for scientific experiments until 1953, when it was dismantled.&lt;ref name="The Atom" /&gt;

Hall's research interests included nuclear reactor development, [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[neutron]] physics, and [[cosmic rays]].{{sfn|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|pp=194–195}} In 1951 she informed [[Robert Oppenheimer]] of the results of the [[Operation Greenhouse]] George nuclear test, in which the yield of an atomic bomb was "boosted" by the addition of a small capsule containing less than {{convert|1|oz}} of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]], which nonetheless increased the yield by {{convert|25|ktTNT}}.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|p=474}}

Hall became assistant director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1958. That year she was an American delegate at the [[Atoms for Peace]] Conference in [[Geneva]]. She was secretary of the General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) from 1956 until 1959, and was a member of the GAC from 1966 to 1972. When President [[Lyndon Johnson]] appointed her in 1966, she became the first woman to serve on the GAC. She was also a member of the AEC Advisory committee on Nuclear Materials and Safeguards from 1967 to 1972. She retired from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1970.&lt;ref name="The Atom" /&gt;{{sfn|Sylves|1987|p=65}} In October of that year, the chairman of the AEC, [[Glenn Seaborg]], presented her with the Atomic Energy Commission Citation and gold medal.&lt;ref name="The Atom" /&gt; She died in November 1981.&lt;ref name="David Hall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url |title=United States Social Security Death Index," database |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JYN3-PZC  |publisher=Family Search |date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=25 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Edward Werner'''&lt;ref name="RT1978"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="WernerBACM"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (September 20, 1909, [[Rayne, Louisiana]] – June 10, 1978, [[Ft. Worth, Texas]])&lt;ref name="RT1978"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="WernerBACM"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Cajun music]]ian most remembered for his tune "Wondering" made famous by [[Webb Pierce]]. He played for many years with the group [[Hackberry Ramblers]] as they were known as Riverside Ramblers as well as in several Cajun groups of his own.  Although his career spanned only two years, 1937 and 1938, his French and English tunes influenced many Cajun musicians in Louisiana for years. 

==Early life==
Joe was exposed to music in his early life having many musicians in his family.  His parents, Max and Martha Werner with both German immigrants, with Max being a veteran of the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name="WernerBACM"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  He recalled back when he was a barefooted kid, he told his father before Christmas that he wanted Santa Claus to bring him a harmonica.  He got his harmonica and he started "fooling" with music.  Year after year, the Christmas request was the same, and year after year, Santa Claus came through with another harmonica.&lt;ref name="CDS1952"&gt;{{cite news |date=1952 |title=Werner's Wondering Finds New Popularity |newspaper=Crowley Daily Signal |location=Acadia Parish Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout his school years, he performed on stage as both a vaudeville [[black face]] actor in minstrel shows and as a whistling, guitar playing, singing musician.&lt;ref name="CDS1935"&gt;{{cite news |date=October 18, 1935|title=St. Joseph Fair Will Open On Saturday |newspaper=Rayne Tribune |location=Acadia Parish Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="RT1927"&gt;{{cite news |date=May 7, 1927|title=Large Crowd Attends Community Singing |newspaper=Rayne Tribune |location=Acadia Parish Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; At some point in the early 30s, he moved to [[Crowley, Louisiana]] where he participated in talent competitions in the city, even travelling to Chicago with fellow actor and entertainer, S.L. Ross.

==String band era==
In 1935, the Hackberry Ramblers began recording music for [[RCA Victor]] records on their budget [[Bluebird Records]] label.  Joe got married in 1936 and late that year, he began playing with the band. In 1937, the group was invited to record in [[New Orleans]] for a session where several English tunes were sung under the band name "Riverside Ramblers".  Joe sang and played a tune he claimed he learned from a travelling hobo called "Wondering".  According to Joe:
{{Quote|text=It was back in my courtin' days.  One day I sat down and started picking away at the guitar and playing the harmonica and the tune fell together.  I worked out the words the same way.  It was in Paco's Cafe over in Rayne.  I had the song and words before I left Paco's that night.&lt;ref name="CDS1952"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; |author=Joe Werner }}
The song was an instant success and became a hit record for Bluebird that year.  However, the listening public, including possibly RCA executives themselves, didn't realize that his acclaimed original tune was actual a cover of a [[Jack Golding]] song he made in 1928 called "Wondering".   Joe's success caught the attention of [[Decca Records|Decca]] A&amp;R representatives.  Without the Ramblers' consent, Joe signed over the rights of the song to Decca, recording a follow-up song called "Answer to Wondering" in 1937. Over the next year, he left the Hackberry Ramblers and started his own group using a variety of musicians including [[Papa Cairo]], Wayne Perry, [[Happy Fats]], and [[Doc Guidry]].  He had 3 more recording sessions with Bluebird and Decca, changing musicians and band names throughout.  However, by the end of 1938, most major labels were no longer interested in recording Cajun music, ending Joe's recording career.  Alongside the 12 sides recorded with the Ramblers, Joe accomplished 56 more recordings during this time, including "Crap Shooter's Hop" and "Rang Tang Bully". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Tony |last2=Pinson |first2=Bob |date=September 26, 2008 |title=Country Music Records: A Discography, 1921-1942 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=1st |isbn=978-0195366211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After World War II==
With his recording years behind him, Joe started a family and got a job working for the local newspaper.  Joe settled into playing music on Crowley's radio station [[KSIG (AM)|KSIG]], where he would often feature his three children accompanying him.  This came to a halt in 1951 when his oldest son, Richard, was killed in a tragic auto accident.&lt;ref name="CDS1951"&gt;{{cite news |date=April 28, 1951|title=Richard Werner Killed In Bike-Truck Mishap |newspaper=Crowley Daily Signal |location=Acadia Parish Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The following year, [[Webb Pierce]] heard Werner's recording and turned it into one of his hit songs, spending four weeks at the top in 1952.  Joe continued to write columns for the newspaper and made occasional appearances in town until he moved to Fort Worth, Texas with his wife Anne.   He died in 1978.

Witherspoon was a staunch Protestant, nationalist, and supporter of [[republicanism]]. Consequently, he was opposed to the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Legitimist]] [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite rising of 1745–46]].  Following the Jacobite victory at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1746)]], he was briefly imprisoned at [[Doune Castle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = The History of the Presbyterian Church |title = John Witherspoon |url = http://presbyterianhistory.com/b_witherspoon.htm |accessdate = 2007-12-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080220154431/http://presbyterianhistory.com/b_witherspoon.htm |archivedate = February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had a long-term effect on his health.

He became a [[Church of Scotland]] ([[Presbyterian]]) minister at [[Beith]], [[Ayrshire]] (1745–1758), where he married Elizabeth Montgomery of Craighouse. They had ten children, with five surviving to adulthood.

From 1758 to 1768, he was minister of the [[Laigh kirk, Paisley]] (Low Kirk). Witherspoon became prominent within the Church as an Evangelical opponent of the [[Moderate Party (Scotland)|Moderate Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Herman |first=Arthur |title=The Scottish Enlightenment |publisher=Fourth Estate |year =2003 |ISBN = 1-84115-276-5 |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his two pastorates he wrote three well-known works on [[theology]], notably the satire "Ecclesiastical Characteristics" (1753), which opposed the philosophical influence of [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Macintyre |first = Alasdair |title=Whose Justice?

== Princeton ==
[[File:Maclean house.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[President's House (Princeton)|President's House]] in Princeton, New Jersey. Completed in 1756, John Witherspoon lived here from 1768 to 1779; it is a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]].]]
At the urging of [[Benjamin Rush]] and [[Richard Stockton (1730–1781)|Richard Stockton]], whom he met in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]],&lt;ref&gt;Rampant Scotland [http://www.rampantscotland.com/famous/blfamwitherspoon.htm "Rampant Scotland, John Witherspoon"]&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon finally accepted their renewed invitation (having turned one down in 1766) to become president and head professor of the small Presbyterian [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey]] in Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;Rush and Stockton's recruiting letters can be found in  Butterfield, L. H., "John Witherspoon Comes to America", Princeton University Library, Princeton, New Jersey. 1953&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, Witherspoon and his family emigrated to [[New Jersey]] in 1768.

At the age of 45, he became the sixth president of the college, later known as [[Princeton University]]. Upon his arrival, Witherspoon found the school in debt, with weak instruction, and a library collection which clearly failed to meet student needs. He immediately began fund-raising—locally and back home in Scotland—added three hundred of his own books to the library, and began purchasing scientific equipment including the [[Rittenhouse orrery]], many maps, and a terrestrial [[globe]].

Witherspoon also instituted a number of reforms, including modeling the [[syllabus]] and university structure after that used at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and other [[Scottish universities]]. He also firmed up entrance requirements, which helped the school compete with [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]] for scholars.

Witherspoon  personally taught courses in eloquence or belles lettres, chronology (history), and divinity.  However, none was more important than [[moral philosophy]] (a required course). An advocate of [[natural law]] within a [[Christian]] and republican [[cosmology]], Witherspoon considered moral philosophy vital for ministers, lawyers, and those holding positions in government ([[magistrate]]s). Firm but good-humored in his leadership, Witherspoon was very popular among both faculty and students.

Witherspoon had been a prominent evangelical Presbyterian minister in Scotland before accepting the Princeton position. As the college's primary occupation at the time was training ministers, Witherspoon became a major leader of the early [[Presbyterian Church]] in America. He also helped organize [[Nassau Presbyterian Church]] in Princeton, New Jersey.

Nonetheless, Witherspoon transformed a college designed predominantly to train clergymen into a school that would equip the leaders of a new Protestant country. Students who later played prominent roles in the new nation's development included [[James Madison]], [[Aaron Burr]], [[Philip Freneau]], [[William Bradford (Attorney General)|William Bradford]], and [[Hugh Henry Brackenridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffry H. Morrison, ''John Witherspoon and the Founding of the American Republic'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; From among his students came 37 judges (three of whom became justices of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]); 10 Cabinet officers; 12 members of the Continental Congress, 28 U.S. senators, and 49 United States congressmen.

In 1774, Witherspoon wrote of an encounter with an unexplained atmospheric phenomenon. Witherspoon and a few aides were walking along [[Lake Carnegie (New Jersey)|Lake Carnegie]], when an "orb of fire" descended and made its way over to the group. Witherspoon wrote in his journal that it was a visit from an angel, who informed him that he, too, was a divine emissary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pyne |first=F. W. |title=Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence |location=Rockport, Maine |publisher=Picton press |volume=4 Pt. 4 |page=204 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revolutionary War ==
[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|left|300px|In [[John Trumbull]]'s famous painting, Witherspoon is the second seated figure from the (viewer's) right among those shown in the background facing the large table.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrevolution.org/deckey.html americanrevolution.org] Key to Trumbull's picture&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Long wary of the power of the [[British Crown]], Witherspoon saw the growing centralization of government, progressive ideology of colonial authorities, and establishment of [[Episcopacy]] authority as a threat to the Liberties of the colonies.  Of particular interest to Witherspoon was the crown's growing interference in the local and colonial affairs which previously had been the prerogatives and rights of the American authorities. When the crown began to give additional authority to its appointed Episcopacy over Church affairs, British authorities hit a nerve in the Presbyterian Scot, who saw such events in the same lens as his Scottish [[Covenanter]]s.  Soon, Witherspoon came to support the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], joining the [[Committee of Correspondence]] and Safety in early 1774. His 1776 sermon "The Dominion of Providence over the Passions of Men" was published in many editions and he was elected to the [[Continental Congress]] as part of the [[New Jersey]] delegation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Herman| first=Arthur|title=The Scottish Enlightenment | publisher=Fourth Estate| year =2003|isbn=1-84115-276-5|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointed Congressional Chaplain by the President of the Continental Congress [[John Hancock]], and in July 1776, voted to adopt the [[Lee Resolution|Virginia Resolution for Independence]]. In answer to an objection that the country was not yet ready for [[independence]], according to tradition he replied that it "was not only ripe for the measure, but in danger of rotting for the want of it." He lost a son during the [[Battle of Dutchtown]] in 1777.

Witherspoon served in Congress from June 1777 until November 1784 and became one of its most influential members and a workhorse of indigenous energy. He served on over 10,000 committees, most notably the sitting committees, the board of peace and the committee on public correspondence or common affairs. He spoke often in concurrence; helped draft the [[Articles of Confederation]]; helped organize the executive departments; played a major role in shaping public policy; and drew up the instructions for the peace commissioners. He fought against the flood of paper money, and opposed the issuance of bonds without provision for their amortization. "No business can be done, some say, because money is scarce", he wrote.  He also served twice in the [[New Jersey Legislature]], and strongly supported the adoption of the [[United States Constitution]] during the New Jersey ratification debates.

In November 1777, American forces neared, Witherspoon closed and evacuated the College of New Jersey.  The main building, [[Nassau Hall]], was badly damaged and his papers and personal notes were lost. Witherspoon was responsible for its reconstruction after the war, which caused him great personal and financial difficulty. In 1780 he was elected to a one-year term in the [[New Jersey Legislative Council]] representing [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset County]]. At the age of 68, he married a 24-year-old widow, with whom he had two more children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= [https://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/witherspoon_john.html] |accessdate= 2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and burial ==
Witherspoon suffered eye injuries and was blind by 1792. He died in 1794 on his farm [[Tusculum (Princeton, New Jersey)|Tusculum]], just outside Princeton, and is buried along Presidents Row in [[Princeton Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|1156|John Knox Witherspoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An inventory of Witherspoon's possessions taken at his death included "two slaves ... valued at a hundred dollars each", indicating that he owned slaves during his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libguides.princeton.edu/c.php?g=84056&amp;p=544524|title=LibGuides: African American Studies: Slavery at Princeton|last=Knowlton|first=Steven|website=libguides.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Witherspoon and his wife, Elizabeth Montgomery, had a total of 10 children, only five of which survived to accompany their parents to America. James, the eldest, a young man of great promise, graduated from Princeton in 1770, and joined the American army as an aide to General [[Francis Nash]], with the rank of major. The next youngest son, John, graduated from Princeton in 1774, practiced medicine in South Carolina, and was lost at sea in 1795. David, the youngest son, graduated the same year as his brother, married General Francis Nash's widow, and practiced law in New Bern, North Carolina. Anna, the eldest daughter, married Reverend Samuel Smith on June 28, 1775. Reverend Samuel Smith succeeded Dr. Witherspoon as president of Princeton in 1775. Frances, the youngest daughter, married Dr. [[David Ramsay (historian)|David Ramsay]], a delegate from South Carolina to the continental Congress, on March 18, 1763. Witherspoon is an ancestor of actress [[Reese Witherspoon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacLean|first1=Maggie|title=Elizabeth Montgomery Witherspoon|url=http://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2009/06/elizabeth-montgomery-witherspoon.html|website=History of American Women|publisher=History of American Women|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
[[File:Witherspoon-paisley.jpg|thumb|250px|right|John Witherspoon Statue, Paisley, Scotland by [[Alexander Stoddart]]]]
According to Herbert Hovenkamp, Witherspoon's most lasting contribution was the initiation of the [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Scottish Common-Sense Realism]], which he had learned by reading [[Thomas Reid]] and two of his expounders [[Dugald Stewart]] and [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]].&lt;ref name=hovenkamp&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ObgnAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Science+and+Religion+in+America&amp;dq=Science+and+Religion+in+America&amp;pgis=1 Science and Religion in America, 1800–1860], Herbert Hovenkamp, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1978 {{ISBN|0-8122-7748-1}} pp. 5, 9&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- also quoted on page 5 Of HovenKamp --&gt;

Witherspoon revised the moral philosophy curriculum, strengthened the college's commitment to natural philosophy, and positioned Princeton in the larger transatlantic world of the republic of letters. Although he was a proponent of Christian values, Witherspoon's common sense approach to the [[public morality]] of civil magistrates was more influenced by the Enlightenment ethics of Scottish philosophers [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] and [[Thomas Reid]] than the Christian idealism of [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]. In regard to civil magistrates, Witherspoon thus believed moral judgment should be pursued as a science. He held to old concepts from the [[Roman Republic]] of virtuous leadership by civil magistrates, but he also regularly recommended that his students read such modern philosophers as [[Machiavelli]], [[Montesquieu]], and [[David Hume]], even though he disapproved of Hume's "infidel" stance on religion.

Virtue, he argued, could be deduced through the development of the moral sense, an ethical compass instilled by God in all human beings and developed through religious education (Reid) or civil sociability (Hutcheson).  Witherspoon saw morality as having two distinct components: [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[wikt:temporal#Adjective|temporal]]. Civil government owed more to the latter than the former in Witherspoon's Presbyterian doctrine. Thus, public morality owed more to the natural moral laws of the Enlightenment than to revealed Christianity.

In his lectures on moral philosophy at Princeton, required of all juniors and seniors, Witherspoon argued for the revolutionary right of resistance and recommended checks and balances within government. He made a profound impression on his student James Madison, whose suggestions for the [[United States Constitution]] followed both Witherspoon's and Hume's ideas. The historian [[Douglass Adair]] writes, "The syllabus of Witherspoon's lectures . . . explains the conversion of the young Virginian to the philosophy of [[the Enlightenment]]."&lt;ref&gt;Adair, "James Madison", Fame and the Founding Fathers, ed. Trevor Colbourn (ndianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1974) 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Witherspoon accepted the impossibility of maintaining public morality or virtue in the citizenry without an effective religion. In this sense, the temporal principles of morality required a religious component which derived its authority from the spiritual. Therefore, public religion was a vital necessity in maintaining the public morals. However, in this framework, non-Christian societies could have virtue, which, by his definition, could be found in natural law.  Witherspoon, in accordance with the Scottish moral sense philosophy, taught that all human beings, Christian or otherwise, could be virtuous, but he was nonetheless committed to Christianity as the only route to personal salvation.

=== Early life and education ===
José Telésforo Paúl y Vargas was born on 5 January 1831 in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bvarj.html|title=Archbishop José Telésphor Paúl y Vargas [Catholic-Hierarchy]|last=Cheney|first=David M.|website=www.catholic-hierarchy.org|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/bogo0.htm#12639|title=Archdiocese of Bogotá, Colombia|newspaper=GCatholic|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Jose-Telesforo-de-Paul-y-Vargas-Arzobispo/4692692124440089340|title=Jose Telesforo de Paul y Vargas, Arzobispo|website=geni_family_tree|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Rafael Paúl y Motta, a Venezuelan lawyer, and Florentina Vargas Gaitán, he had two siblings, Felpie Fermín and Rafaela.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enciclopedicohistcultiglesiaal.org/diccionario/index.php/PA%C3%9AL,_Jos%C3%A9_Tel%C3%A9sforo|title=PAÚL, José Telésforo - Diccionario de Historia Cultural de América Latina|website=www.enciclopedicohistcultiglesiaal.org|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying at the [[Del Rosario University|Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Señora del Rosario]], Paúl entered the [[Society of Jesus]] at age 13 at their house in [[Popayán]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1850, already a teacher at the [[Colegio Mayor de San Bartolomé]] in Bogotá, he went into exile with other Jesuits due to the Society's persecution by General [[Hilario Lopez (general)|Hilario Lopez]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After leaving Bogotá, he traveled to Europe, where he continued his studies in [[Belgium]], [[France]], and [[Azpeitia|Loyola]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Through his education, he became a notable [[Christian humanism|Christian humanist]] and [[Polyglotism|polyglot]], speaking and writing in four or five languages fluently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://babel.banrepcultural.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p17054coll10/id/44|title=Oración fúnebre del señor José Telésforo Paul, Arzobispo de Bogotá :: Obras generales|website=babel.banrepcultural.org|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Priesthood ===
Paúl was ordained a priest on 5 December 1855,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and was assigned to the [[Seminario de Guatemala]] in [[Guatemala City]], where he taught [[rhetoric]] and the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When the anti-Jesuit persecution ended in Colombia in 1858, his superiors sent him back to Bogotá, where he rose to prominence as a teacher, [[orator]], and counselor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1861, he was exiled from Colombia for the second time, this time by President [[Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He returned to Guatemala, where he was a professor of theology at the seminary and was also mastor of novices for the Guatemalan Jesuits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1869, he was sent with the Rev. Roberto Pozo to found a new Jesuit residence in [[San Salvador]], but were expelled in 1872 by Salvadoran President [[Santiago González (politician)|Santiago González]], along with other religious orders.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Paúl and the other Jesuits moved to [[Ecuador]], before being invited to [[Panama State]] (at that time an autonomous province of Colombia) by President [[Buenaventura Correoso]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He taught there at the diocesan seminary and later was superior of the Jesuits in Panama, with his seat at the Church of St. Francis in [[Panama City]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Bishop of Panama ===
On 17 September 1875, Paúl was appointed Bishop of Panamá by [[Pope Pius IX]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He succeeded [[Ignacio Antonio Parra]], who consecrated him bishop on 25 March 1876, making Paúl the first bishop consecrated in [[Panama]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As bishop of Panamá, Paúl reorganized and established parishes, made frequent pastoral visits to different communities, and made efforts to improve the discipline and education of the clergy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He also took special interest in the construction of the [[Panama Canal]], construction of which began in 1881 by [[France]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Paúl became friends with [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], the French diplomat in charge of the project, and blessed the work at the start of construction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uo8tE1_KMTQC&amp;pg=PT1062&amp;lpg=PT1062&amp;dq=Jos%C3%A9+Tel%C3%A9sforo+Paul&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tfZq55ia2C&amp;sig=C5HSXGCc8VEIk3xE_wfKFJZ_Agg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_p4jx96PRAhUK7SYKHb-xArwQ6AEIXTAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Jos%C3%A9%20Tel%C3%A9sforo%20Paul&amp;f=false|title=David McCullough Great Moments in History E-book Box Set: 1776, The Johnstown Flood, Path Between the Seas, The Great Bridge, The Course of Human Events|last=McCullough|first=David|date=2011-05-24|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781451658231|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually became a trusted advisor and counselor of Lesseps, who described Paúl as "the most illustrious prelate I have ever met."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In addition, he paid special attention to providing religious care to residents of the [[Panama Canal Zone]], dividing it into three different districts and ensuring the regular visit of Panamanian priests.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Paúl made pastoral visits through the diocese several times, and worked to establish schools and hospitals, and invited the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul]] to staff many of them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He wrote [[pastoral letter]]s, which encouraged [[evangelism]] and Catholic education, condemned the conflict of [[liberalism]] with Catholicism, and addressed the relationship between church and state.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1877, Paúl personally had traveled to the [[Congress of Colombia]] to demand respectful treatment of the church by the government.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Archbishop of Bogotá ===
Following the death of Archbishop [[Vicente Arbeláez Gómez]], Paúl was appointed archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bogotá|Santafé en Nueva Granada]] (now Bogotá) on 6 August 1884 by [[Pope Leo XIII]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There, he participated in the drafting of the new [[Colombian Constitution of 1886]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He died on 8 April 1889 in Bogotá, aged 58.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Khalid Mahmood''' (born 13 July 1961) is a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[politician]] who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Birmingham Perry Barr (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Perry Barr]] since [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]].

==Political career==
Mahmood is a graduate of [[UCE Birmingham]] and a former engineer with a trade union background. He was a [[Birmingham City Council]]lor from 1990 to 1992. In 2001, Mahmood was selected for the [[Birmingham Perry Barr (UK Parliament constituency)|Perry Barr seat]] by local Labour party members.

Although Mahmood held the seat for Labour in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 election]], his share of the vote fell by 16.5%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/results_constituencies/constituencies/059.stm |title=Birmingham Perry Barr 2001 Election Results |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of which went to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] candidate Jon Hunt, who ran on an anti-sleaze ticket. Mahmood subsequently increased his share of the vote slightly at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 election]], though his majority fell by 805 votes. He was again elected in 2010.&lt;ref name="birmingham"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/general-election-2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508033256/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/general-election-2010 |archive-date= 8 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |title=General Election 2010 – Birmingham City Council |accessdate=8 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to Home Office Minister [[Tony McNulty]] from 10 November 2005 until 6 September 2006, when he resigned after signing a letter calling for Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] to step down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5319328.stm |title=Blair hit by wave of resignations |date=6 September 2006 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistani-born Mahmood stated that he was "flabbergasted and shocked" after it was discovered that [[Osama bin Laden]] was living in a city with thousands of Pakistani troops, reviving questions about alleged links between [[al-Qaeda]] and elements in Pakistan's security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodcock |first=Andrew |date=2 May 2011 |title=MP 'shocked' at bin Laden Pakistan discovery |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/mp-shocked-at-bin-laden-pakistan-discovery-2277941.htm |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahmood opposed the decision by Birmingham College in 2013 to ban students wearing veils. "I am seriously concerned that the college has taken this approach," Mahmood told ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. "I see no reason why young women should not be able to practice their faith and wear what is appropriate for their religion, [...] It is about freedom to protect your rights. The college should demonstrate and encourage respect of belief, colour and background. [The decision] is not an example to set to students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sherriff|first=Lucy|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/09/10/birmingham-metropolitan-college-bans-muslim-students-wearing-veils_n_3898013.html|title=Muslim Students Banned From Wearing Veils, Niqabs, For 'Safety' At Birmingham Metropolitan College|work=The Huffington Post|date=10 September 2013|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In House of Commons divisions, he has voted for the introduction of national ID cards, student top-up fees, anti-terrorism laws and he voted against investigating the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/khalid_mahmood/birmingham%2C_perry_barr |title=Khalid Mahmood |publisher=theyworkforyou.com |accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also on the Advisory Council (as a Labour Political Council member) of the [[Henry Jackson Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://henryjacksonsociety.org/people/council-members/ |title=Khalid Mahmood on Advisory Council of Henry Jackson Society |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923022301/http://henryjacksonsociety.org/people/council-members/ |archivedate=23 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|EU referendum]], Mahmood initially supported the Leave campaign but left in February when it started to attack migrants. In June, he subsequently announced his support for the Remain campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/birmingham-mp-khalid-mahmood-backs-11451505|title=Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood backs EU 'remain' campaign |date=9 June 2016|accessdate=10 June 2016|newspaper=Birmingham Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK MP expenses row===
In May 2009, it was revealed, as part of [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|a series of leaked UK MPs expense details]], that Mahmood claimed for £1,350 to stay in a five-star west London hotel with his girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8064731.stm |title=Man behind expenses leak revealed |date=23 May 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmood also claimed more than £35,000 in expenses for food over the course of his eight years as an MP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2009/05/24/expenses-lovenest-of-birmingham-mp-khalid-mahmood-66331-23698297/ |title=Expenses lovenest of Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood |date=24 May 2009 |first=Jeanette |last=Oldham |newspaper=Sunday Mercury |accessdate=3 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==

[[File:Gallen Kallela Lemminkainens Mother.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''[[Lemminkäinen's Mother]]'', an 1897 painting by [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]]: She is shown having just gathered his broken body from the dark river.]]

'''Lemminkäinen''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈlemːiŋˌkæinen}}) or '''Lemminki''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈlemːiŋki}}) is a prominent figure in [[Finnish mythology]].  He is one of the [[Hero]]es of the [[Kalevala]], where his character is a composite of several separate heroes of oral poetry. He is usually depicted as young and good-looking, with wavy red hair.

The original, mythological Lemminkäinen is a shamanistic figure. In the Kalevala, he has been blended together with epic war-heroes Kaukomieli/Kaukamoinen and [[Ahti]] Saarelainen. 

In one myth, he drowns in the river of [[Tuonela]] (the underworld) in trying to capture or kill the black swan that lives there as part of an attempt, as [[Ilmarinen]] once made, to win a daughter of [[Louhi]] as his wife. In a tale somewhat reminiscent of [[Isis]]' search for [[Osiris]], Lemminkäinen's mother searches heaven and earth to find her son. Finally, she learns of his fate and asks [[Ilmarinen]] to fashion her a rake of copper with which to dredge her son's body from the river of Tuonela. Thus equipped, she descends into the underworld in search of her son. On the banks of the river of the underworld, she rakes up first Lemminkäinen's tunic and shoes, and then, his maimed and broken body. Unrelenting, she continues her work until every piece of Lemminkäinen's body is recovered. Sewing the parts together and offering prayers to the gods, the mother tries to restore Lemminkäinen to life, but while she succeeds in remaking his body, his life is still absent. Then, she entreats a bee to ascend to the halls of the over-god [[Ukko]] and fetch from there a drop of honey as ointment that would bring Lemminkäinen back to life. Only with such a potent remedy is the hero finally restored.

Lemminkäinen and the Scandinavian [[Balder]] have many things in common in their respective myths (for example, both are killed by a blind man at the feast of gods or heroes) which has led some researchers to believe they share a common origin.

==Lemminkäinen in arts==
Lemminkäinen is the subject of the four-part "[[Lemminkäinen Suite]]" by [[Jean Sibelius]], and of an overture by [[Väinö Haapalainen]], both Finnish composers.

The 2007 album (''[[Silent Waters (Amorphis album)|Silent Waters]]'') of Finnish [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Amorphis]] is about the story of Lemminkäinen.

The 2008 song (''[[River of Tuoni (Amberian Dawn song)|River of Tuoni]]'') by Finnish [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Amberian Dawn]] is about Lemminkäinen's mother's search for  him in the river of Tuoni. 

He is the protagonist of the 1959 film, ''[[The Day the Earth Froze]]''.

The ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' character [[Mordenkainen]] is partially named after him.

'''Frau Maria Silbert''' (1866-1936) was an Austrian spiritualist [[mediumship|medium]]. 

==Biography==

Silbert was born in [[Waltendorf]], [[Graz]] and claimed powers of [[apport (paranormal)|apportation]] and [[psychokinesis]] as well as the ability to produce "spirit raps". Her famous trick was to engrave [[cigarette case]]s under the table during her [[séance]]s.&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2001"&gt; [[Massimo Polidoro]]. (2001). ''Final Seance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle''. Prometheus Books. p. 103. {{ISBN|978-1573928960}}&lt;/ref&gt; She allowed some lighting in her séances but did not allow investigators to look under the table where most of her phenomena was said to occur.&lt;ref name="Roberts 1932"&gt;[[C. E. Bechhofer Roberts]]. (1932). ''The Truth about Spiritualism''. Kessinger Publishing. pp. 130-132. {{ISBN|978-1417981281}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1925, the British psychical researcher [[Harry Price]] investigated Silbet and caught her using her feet and toes to move objects in the séance room.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence]]. (1991). ''Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology''. Gale Research Company. p. 1522. {{ISBN|978-0810301962}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Walter Franklin Prince]] in 1927 discovered how Silbert performed the cigarette trick. She had developed the ability to maneuver a stiletto using only her feet and was thus able to write names on the cigarette cases when they were held under the table.&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2001"/&gt; Another researcher [[Theodore Besterman]] investigated Silbert in 1928 and observed that the "spirit raps" only occurred when Silbert had her legs under the table or in front of the chair which suggested that she tapped the furniture herself with her feet to make the sounds.&lt;ref name="Roberts 1932"/&gt;

Adalbert Evian supported Silbert and wrote the book ''The Mediumship of Maria Silbert'' (1936). The psychical researcher [[Eric Dingwall]] in a review wrote "As a work of scientific interest it is worthless, but as illustrating the minds of those over whom Frau Silbert cast her influence it is by no means without value."&lt;ref&gt;[[Trevor H. Hall]]. (1984). ''The Enigma of Daniel Home: Medium Or Fraud?''. Prometheus Books. p. 44. {{ISBN|978-0879752361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Everson joined [[alliantgroup]], LP, a national tax advisory consultant, to advise the firm and its clients on matters related to the IRS and on strategic, operational, and client service initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliantgroup.com/_ag/index.cfm/newsroom/press-releases/irs-commissioner-joins-alliantgroup/ |title=IRS Commissioner Joins alliantgroup |publisher=Alliantgroup.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Everson was a candidate for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican presidential nomination in 2016]], until he withdrew his candidacy on November 5, 2015.

==Education==

Prior to joining the Bush administration in August 2001, he was group vice president of finance at [[SC International Services]], Inc., at the time a $2 billion privately owned, [[Dallas]]-based, [[food service]]s company with leading market positions in both [[airline catering]] and home meals.

While with Pechiney, he held various financial and operating positions in the United States, France and [[Turkey]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

From August 1, 2002 until his IRS confirmation, Everson served as deputy director for management for the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB). He chaired the President's Management Council, which is composed of [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] department and major agency chief operating officers. The council is charged with improving overall [[executive branch]] management, including implementation of the President's Management Agenda. Before becoming deputy director for management, he served as controller of the [[Office of Federal Financial Management]], also a part of OMB.

Everson was appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] to a five-year term as [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]], the head of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), and was confirmed by the [[U.S. Senate]] on May 1, 2003 as its 46th commissioner. Areas of focus during his tenure with the IRS included combating abusive tax shelters and the development of more productive enforcement relationships with counterpart tax authorities in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/KPMG-to-Pay-$456-Million-for-Criminal-Violations|title=KPMG to Pay $456 Million for Criminal Violations|date=|publisher=Irs.gov|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everson left the IRS effective May 4, 2007, before the end of his term to join the American Red Cross as its new CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/red-cross-appoints-new-ceo/|title=Red Cross appoints new CEO - The NonProfit Times|work=The NonProfit Times|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Everson was a cabinet member for Indiana Governor [[Mitch Daniels]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/candidates/2015/08/04/mark-everson-iowa-caucus-candidate-profile/31108759/|title=Mark Everson|work=Des Moines Register|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; from January 2009 to May 2012, where he served initially as Department of Administration Commissioner. From 2010–2012, Everson served as the Commissioner of the Department of Workforce Development, where he oversaw the state's unemployment system and federal training programs. In this role, Everson began a program that was endorsed by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce and the Indiana Manufacturers Association that helped qualifying ex-offenders realize employment opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/state-launches-program-to-help-employ-exoffenders/PARAMS/article/29096 |title=State launches program to help employ ex-offenders |publisher=Ibj.com |date=2011-08-24 |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Red Cross===
On April 18, 2007, the Board of Governors of the [[American Red Cross]] unanimously approved Everson as President and Chief Executive Officer of the American Red Cross, effective May 29, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donmoyer |first=Ryan J. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aLlJ6K1412mQ&amp;refer=us |title=IRS Commissioner Mark Everson to Head American Red Cross |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2007-04-18 |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 27, 2007, the Board of Governors, after learning that Everson engaged in a personal relationship with a subordinate employee, asked for and received Everson's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/27/us/27cnd-cross.html |title=Red Cross Dismisses President, Citing Relationship|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 27, 2007|accessdate=2015-04-11|first=Stephanie|last=Strom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that the "personal relationship" was with a married woman, Paige Roberts, CEO of the Southeast Mississippi Red Cross chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fenner |first=Austin |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12032007/news/nationalnews/red_cross_mama_850510.htm?page=0 |title=RED CROSS MAMA &amp;#124; New York Post |publisher=Nypost.com |date=2007-12-03 |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 presidential campaign==
[[File:Mark Everson 2016.jpg|thumb|Mark Everson's campaign logo]]
On March 5, 2015, Everson announced his intention to seek the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican Party's]] nomination for President of the United States in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/5/mark-everson-launches-gop-white-house-bid-pro-amne/ |title=Mark Everson, former Reagan &amp; Bush aide, launches GOP White House bid on pro-amnesty platform |publisher=Washingtontimes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched his bid with a video and 16-page [[open letter]], in which he laid out six primary issues:

{{quote|
# Fundamental tax reform.
# Confronting the lawlessness of the Big Banks.
# Re-establishing the draft in order to have a shared sense of national service.
# Real, balanced reforms to America's entitlement programs.
# Reinforcing the American tradition of assimilation through comprehensive immigration reform.
# Serving only a single term to keep re-election politics out of Presidential decision-making.}}

On September 11, 2015, the ''Des Moines Register'' published an op-ed entitled "Iowans should learn Everson's  name, ideas", praising him as a candidate "insider enough to understand the  messy business of political compromise, and outsider enough, in his words, not  to 'owe any backers.'" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/10/editorial-iowans-should-learn-eversons-name-ideas/72001412|title=Editorial: Iowans should learn Everson's name, ideas|website=The Des Moines Register|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Everson was the first declared candidate to open an office in Iowa, and logged more visits to the state than seven other major candidates, he was not listed in the Iowa Poll sponsored by Register and Bloomberg Politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/10/editorial-iowans-should-learn-eversons-name-ideas/72001412|title=Editorial: Iowans should learn Everson's name, ideas|website=The Des Moines Register|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Everson was one of the 18 candidates listed on the Republican National Committee's straw poll (and even outperformed some of the GOP's front-runners in non-scientific straw polls), but was not invited to the televised debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/10/editorial-iowans-should-learn-eversons-name-ideas/72001412|title=Editorial: Iowans should learn Everson's name, ideas|website=The Des Moines Register|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing in Cleveland: GOP candidate Mark Everson|last1=Harper|first1=John|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/08/missing_in_cleveland_gop_candi.html|website=Cleveland.com|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being informed that he would not be allowed to participate in a scheduled Fox News debate in Cleveland on August 6, 2015, Everson filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election Commission, arguing that Fox News had violated election laws by failing to adhere to consistent criteria in  determining the candidates that would make the debate stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing in Cleveland: GOP candidate Mark Everson|last1=Harper|first1=John|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/08/missing_in_cleveland_gop_candi.html|website=Cleveland.com|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox News originally  stated that candidates must be polling at 1 percent in an average of five  national polls to participate, but did away with the standard a week before the  scheduled debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing in Cleveland: GOP candidate Mark Everson|last1=Harper|first1=John|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/08/missing_in_cleveland_gop_candi.html|website=Cleveland.com|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 7, 2015, the ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'' ran an op-ed arguing that Everson should have been included in the 5 p.m. debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheers &amp; Jeers, with a Jeer to those who let maggot-ridden, starved Akron dog die: editorial|url=http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/08/cheers_jeers_including_a_cheer_1.html|website=Cleveland.com|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on the campaign trail, Everson was one of the earliest critics of eventual Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. After Trump's presidential announcement, Everson called for Trump to drop out of the race due to his false and incendiary comments regarding Mexican immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Derby|first1=Kevin|title=Donald Trump Compared to Dylann Roof by GOP Dark Horse Mark Everson|url=http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/blog/donald-trump-compared-dylann-roof-gop-dark-horse-mark-everson|website=Sunshine State News|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Everson|first1=Mark W.|title=Why I cannot support Trump|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/06/28/why-cannot-support-trump/86453032/|website=The Des Moines Register|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everson put almost $400,000 of his own money into the campaign and raised around $100,000. On November 5, 2015, Everson withdrew from the race citing lack of funds, no debate inclusion, and scarce media attention as factors for ending his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/05/the-republican-fields-16th-candidate-is-ending-his-longest-shot-campaign/|title=The Republican field's 16th candidate is ending his longest-shot campaign|work=Washington Post|author=Phillip Bump|date=2015-11-05|accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, before the Republican convention, Everson stated that he could neither "get on board" with Trump nor "look the other way." He condemned the candidate's policy proposals as "reckless, be they stripping trillions in revenues from the Treasury…or countenancing nuclear proliferation to name two of the worst." Everson wrote that "the deplorable demeanor he has deliberately cultivated over decades" disqualifies Trump from public service and that "his campaign is more than divisive; particularly for our young it is destructive and even frightening." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Everson|first1=Mark W.|title=Why I cannot support Trump|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/06/28/why-cannot-support-trump/86453032/|website=The Des Moines Register|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muhammad Qutb''', ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|t|ə|b}}; {{lang-ar|محمد قطب}};&amp;lrm; 1919 – April 4, 2014) was an  [[Islamist]] author, scholar and teacher best known as the younger brother of the [[Egypt]]ian Islamist thinker [[Sayyid Qutb]]. After his brother was executed by the [[Egypt]]ian government, Muhammad moved to Saudi Arabia where he promoted his older brother's ideas.&lt;ref name="Kepel, Gilles 2004, p.174-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kepel, 2004, 51"/&gt;

==Background==
Muhammad Qutb was the second oldest of five children born in the Upper Egyptian village of [[Musha, Egypt|Musha]] near [[Asyut]], several years younger than his elder brother Sayyid. Little is known in English sources about his upbringing and education but it is known that he lived with his famous brother, their two sisters and mother in [[Helwan]] near [[Cairo]] for several years starting in 1926. He was arrested a few days before Sayyid (on July 29, 1965) for his alleged co-leadership along with his brother in a plot&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''[Muslim] Extremism in Egypt, the Prophet and Pharaoh,'' University of California, 1985, p.39, 32&lt;/ref&gt; to kill leading political and cultural figures in Egypt and overthrow the government. His brother died on the gallows in 1966, but Muhammad's life was spared&lt;ref name="Kepel, Gilles 2004, p.174-5"&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''The War for Muslim Minds : Islam and the West'' Belknap Press, 2004, p.174-5&lt;/ref&gt; and he, along with other members of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]  took refuge in [[Saudi Arabia]].

There he edited and published Sayyid's books&lt;ref name="Kepel, 2004, 51"&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''Jihad : the Trail of Political Islam'' (2002), p.51&lt;/ref&gt; and taught as a professor of Islamic Studies at (according to different sources) either [[Mecca]]'s [[Umm al-Qura University|Umm al-Qura]] University,&lt;ref name="Kepel, Gilles 2004, p.174-5"/&gt; and/or [[King Abdulaziz University]] in [[Jeddah]], and that either [[Osama bin Laden]] or [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] ([[al Qaeda]]'s #2 and leading theorist), was a student. Osama bin Laden recommended "Sheikh Muhammad Qutb's" book, "''Concepts that Should be Corrected'' in a 2004 videotape.&lt;ref&gt;January 4, 2004, videotape delivered to al-Jazeera, quoted in ''[[Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama bin Laden]]'', Verso, 2005, p.229&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Lawrence Wright]], who interviewed Muhammad Qutb and a close friend in college of bin Laden's,  Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, bin Laden "usually attended" Muhammad Qutb's weekly public lectures at King Abdul-Aziz University.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,'' by Lawrence Wright, NY, Knopf, 2006, p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to making available his brother's work, M. Qutb worked to advance his ideas by "smoothing away" differences between his brother's radical supporters and more conservative [[Muslim]]s, particularly other members of the [[Muslim Brotherhood|Brethren]]. Muhammad took a less literal interpretation of his brother's famous statement that the Muslim world and Muslim governments were ''[[jahiliyya]]'' (returned to pagan ignorance, and thus no longer Muslim). He denied that the country that had given him refuge (Saudi Arabia) was ''jahiliyya'',&lt;ref name="Kepel, Gilles 2004, p.174-5"/&gt; and in 1975 came out publicly against [[Takfir]], or judging Muslims as unbelievers.&lt;ref&gt;Sivan, Emmanuel, ''Radical Islam : Medieval Theology and Modern Politics,'' 
Yale University, 1985, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''Le Prophete et Pharaon,''  Editions Le Decouverte, 1984, p.61-64&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked to reconcile the doctrine of the Muslims Brothers with "the [[salafism]] that prevailed in his host country".&lt;ref name="Kepel, Gilles 2004, p.174-5"/&gt;

In 1986, [[Safar Al-Hawali]] defended his dissertation under Muhammad Qutb's supervision. "His defense was so impressive" that M. Qutb "declared in public that the student had surpassed his teacher".&lt;ref name="Kepel, Gilles 2004, p.174-5"/&gt;  Al-Hawali went on to become one of the "two main figures of the sahwa" (Islamist awakening), which "mingled radical Wahhabism with Sayyid Qutb's ideas".&lt;ref name="Kepel, Gilles 2004, p.174-5"/&gt;

Muhammad was an author in his own right and his writings are widespread in the [[Arab]] world and nearly as prolific as his brother's. ''Jahiliyya in the Twentieth Century'' is perhaps his best-known work,&lt;ref name="Kepel, Gilles 2004, p.174-5"/&gt; and gained notoriety as an alleged terrorist handbook (along with his brother's  ''[[Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq|Milestones]]'') when the government claimed to find the two in police searches of plotters' homes and environs.&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''[Muslim] Extremism in Egypt, the Prophet and Pharaoh'', University of California, English translation published in 1986, (Original French edition published in 1984, ''Le Prophète et Pharaon'', Editions Le Decouverte.)  p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Another very popular work, ''Islam: the Misunderstood Religion,'' expands on his brother's ideas, describing the ways in which fundamentalist Islam is superior to the "perverted ... inhuman ... crazy ... savage and backward" [[Western world]].&lt;ref name=GTWIftE&gt;Abou El Fadl, Khaled, ''The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists'', Harper San Francisco, 2005, p.298&lt;/ref&gt;  {{#tag:ref|Among other things the book maintains that the teachings of Christian clerics in Europe led to "the torturing of scientists and burning them alive because they [the scientists] said, for instance, that the earth was round";&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, ''Islam,'' 5th ed, p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt; that the science of psychology tells us that a beating of "mild severity" of a wife by her husband is "in certain psychological perversions ... the only effective remedy ... to correct" the wife's "conduct";&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, ''Islam,'' 5th ed, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;  that "American statistics ... show that 38% of secondary school girls are pregnant";&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, ''Islam,'' 5th ed, p.146&lt;/ref&gt; and that prostitution was outlawed in Western countries  because "prostitutes had lost all their usefulness, their place having been taken by the common sybaritic society girls".&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, ''Islam,'' 5th ed, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/muhammad_qutb_islam.html#intro "Muhammad Qutb's Islam : the Misunderstood Religion"] Elmer Swenson, 27 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}  

Muhammad Qutb died at a hospital in [[Mecca]] on 4 April 2014 at the age of 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.madhyamam.com/en/node/22234|title=Muhammad Qutb, brother of Sayyid Qutb, passes away|date=April 4, 2014| newspaper= [[Madhyamam]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chief Pericoma Mezuo Okoye''' was a Nigerian [[singer]], [[songwriter]] and [[tradition]]ist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weeklypostng.org/2017/02/breaking-pericoma-is-dead-photos.html?m=1|title=BREAKING!!! Legendary Musician, Pericomo Okoye aka 'Arusi Makaja 1 Of Igboland' Is Dead (Photos)|website=www.weeklypostng.org|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first name 'Pericoma' could alternatively be spelled as 'Pericomo' 'Perry-Coma' and 'Perry-Koma'. He was predominantly known throughout the [[Igboland]] for his style of music and strong belief and practice of the traditional religion of the [[Igbo people]], named [[Obeah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heffernan|first=Andrew|title=Obeah, Christianity, and Jamaica|url=https://www.academia.edu/10845660/Obeah_Christianity_and_Jamaica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.memidex.com/obeah+religious-cult|title=obeah (religious cult) - Memidex dictionary/thesaurus|website=www.memidex.com|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life ==
Okoye was born in Nigeria, specifically in [[Imo State]], an eastern state occupied by the Igbo people of Nigeria. He was born in a community named [[Arondizuogu]], a community that occupies three local government areas: [[Ideato North]], [[Okigwe]], and [[Onuimo]].

==Prime minister ==
Okoye was prime minister of the Arondizogu community in Imo state until his death in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://elombah.com/index.php/reports/14386-breaking-news-pericoma-okoye-is-dead|title=Popular Igbo Musician Pericoma Okoye Is Dead [Update]|last=Elombah|first=Tim|newspaper=E-max|access-date=2017-02-17|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music style==
His music style could be best described as "oral rendition of the culture, proverbs, as well as the tradition of the Igbo people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://authorityngr.com/2017/02/-Igbo-traditional-high-life-music-exponent-Pericoma-Okoye-passes-on/|title=Igbo traditional high life music exponent, Pericoma Okoye, passes on|website=authorityngr.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career ==
He featured in a movie titled ''Lion Of Africa'' alongside Nollywood star, [[Pete Edochie]]. The movie, which was in two parts, was a biography of his early life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Aku-King NollyTV|title=LION OF AFRICA 1 = African Best Movie|date=2015-12-02|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=49kftLI1Q7c|accessdate=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Okoye was a firm believer and practitioner of the traditional religion of the Igbo people, Obeah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/m/l1d_8jw6suli/obeah/|title=Obeah|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ancestralvoices.tumblr.com/post/125752669232/kemetic-dreams-obeah-sometimes-spelled-obi|title=kemetic-dreams:     Obeah (sometimes spelled Obi,... {{!}} Ancestral Voices: Esoteric African knowledge|website=Ancestral Voices: Esoteric African knowledge|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional religion==
Pericoma Okoye whilst alive was as much a famous sorcerer or 'medicine man' as he was a musician as described by Nigerian News, NAIJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.naij.com/1088720-ichie-mezuo-pericomo-okoye-arusi-makaja-1-aka-pericoma-allegedly-dies.html|title=Igboland griefs as top traditionalist dies (photos)|last=Odunayo|first=Adams|newspaper=Naij.com – Nigeria news.|access-date=2017-02-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; His title 'Arusi Makaja' may also portray this, as 'Arusi' when translated to English language means 'deity' or 'oracle'. During the Ikeji festival&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Onyekaba Ugo|title=Pericoma Okoye (IKEJI FESTIVAL '77) 1|date=2013-09-16|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8ZDKGL13E|accessdate=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; he performed several feats which defied several rules of physics. A good percentage of the people from [[Arondizuogu]], his community, believed he was a little god. Several displays of "supernatural powers" or "sorcery" as it was often tagged, and back-to-back victories in contests, earned him the alias "Lion of Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://9jaflaver.com/igbo-musician-magician-lion-of-africa-actor-pericoma-is-dead/|title=Igbo Musician, Magician &amp; "Lion Of Africa" Actor, Pericoma Is Dead {{!}} 9jaflaver|website=9jaflaver.com|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance ==
Okoye was a prominent individual in Nigeria as a traditional prime minister in Imo state. He was instrumental and took notable roles in the development of the Ikeji festival&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://logbaby.com/encyclopedia/ikeji-festival-of-ar_12624.html|title=IKEJI FESTIVAL OF ARONDIZUOGU Logbaby|website=logbaby.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nico.gov.ng/index.php/cultural-events/37-cultural-events/475-ikeji-festival-in-arondizogu|title=Ikeji Festival In Arondizogu|last=Webmaster|website=www.nico.gov.ng|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; held in his community.

'''[[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]]''' was the [[president of Argentina]] between 2007 and 2015. 

==Personal image==
[[File:Visita a la planta Toyota en Zárate.jpg|thumb|Cristina Kirchner, dressed in black]]
After her victory in the [[Argentine general election, 2011|2011 presidential elections]], she claimed that the elections were a triumph of love, implying that her voters loved her.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelevich, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1397684-resultados-de-las-elecciones-primarias-2011|title= Cristina Kirchner, con el 50 por ciento de los votos, quedó a las puertas de la reelección|trans-title=Cristina Kirchner, with 50% of the vote, is in the doorstep of re-election|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 15, 2011|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her speeches include a large number of self-references.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelevich, pp. 375&amp;ndash;376&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchner is famously passionate about clothes.&lt;ref name="estilo"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/12/11/elpais/p-01001.htm|title=El estilo Cristina presidenta: vestido más sobrio y maquillaje más discreto|publisher=Clarin.com|date=11 December 2007|accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article2702799.ece|title=Argentina's new Evita Peron tangoes her way to power|work=The Times|location=UK|date=21 October 2007|accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wears a mixture of textures, colors, and prints, and always wears makeup and high heels.&lt;ref name="estilo" /&gt; She dressed in black for the 3 years following the [[death and state funeral of Néstor Kirchner|death of her husband]], [[Néstor Kirchner]].  The acceptance of this [[widow]] image was higher among Argentine women.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelevich, pp. 220&amp;ndash;221&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kirchner's detractors her condition of widowhood was accompanied by a campaign of idealization of her late husband, who was allegedly treated as a religious figure.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelevich, pp. 132&amp;ndash;134&lt;/ref&gt; Kirchner ceased wearing black clothes on November 20, 2013, after three years and a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tn.com.ar/politica/definitivo-el-paso-a-paso-de-como-cristina-abandono-el-luto_423689|title= Definitivo: el paso a paso de cómo Cristina abandonó el luto|trans-title=Definitive: the step by step of how Cristina left her mourning|language= Spanish|author= |date= November 26, 2013|publisher= Todo Noticias|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of social media===
Kirchner is one of the few Argentines with a [[Twitter]] account with over a million followers, along with [[Gustavo Cerati]], [[Emanuel Ginóbili]], [[Sergio Agüero]], [[Luisana Lopilato]], [[Zaira Nara]], [[Jorge Rial]], and [[Paula Chaves]].&lt;ref name="M357"&gt;Mendelevich, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Her messages are written in an informal tone, and may criticise or mock fellow politicians or her opponents, or may be about her private life.&lt;ref name="M357" /&gt; Her messages are usually written in [[Grammatical person|second person singular]], which in Spanish is mainly used when talking to a close friend. The account is however rarely used to chat with anyone and it follows only 50 others, mainly members of her cabinet, world leaders, and government institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelevich, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political image==
Cristina Kirchner is a highly divisive political figure in Argentina.&lt;ref name="divided"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/argentine-president-set-to-leave-office-and-a-divided-nation/article22886073/|title= Argentine President set to leave office and a divided nation|author= Stephanie Nolen|date= February 9, 2015|publisher= The Globe and Mail|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kirchnerite administration used its aligned media and the communication outlets of the state for advocacy of the figures of both Cristina Kirchner and the previous president, her husband Néstor Kirchner.&lt;ref name="Mendelevich311"/&gt; This advocacy, which describes the Kirchners as leaders of a revolution, is usually called the "Relato K" ({{lang-es|K narrative}}).&lt;ref name="Mendelevich311"&gt;Mendelevich, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romero, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Political life is described as a [[conflict between good and evil]], in a manner similar to [[religious faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/opinion/Kirchnerismo-progresismo-conservador_0_757124369.html|title= Kirchnerismo, un progresismo conservador|trans-title=Kirchnerism, a conservative progresism|language= Spanish|author= Lucio Lapeña|date= August 17, 2012|work= Clarín|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, the "good" side consists of the government and the Argentine people as a whole,&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1491274-el-progresismo-reaccionario|title= El progresismo reaccionario|trans-title=The conservative progresism|language= Spanish|author= Alejandro Katz|date= July 18, 2012|work= La Nación|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the "evil" side consists of the non-aligned media{{Clarify|date=June 2016}} (mainly the [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|''Clarín'' newspaper]]), the rural industries, the [[financial services]], the [[vulture funds]],&lt;ref name="M210"&gt;Mendelevich, pp. 210&amp;ndash;211&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[imperialism]] and local Argentines aligned with it.&lt;ref name="katz" /&gt; Again according to her detractors all the problems in the Kirchner administration are blamed on those sectors; Kirchnerism never engages in self-criticism.&lt;ref name="M210" /&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2016}} Specific people or organizations may be placed on either the "good" or "evil" side according to the political needs of the time, and the pro-Kirchner network may shift the support or criticism accordingly.&lt;ref name="katz" /&gt; Her speeches also resort to [[appeal to emotion]].&lt;ref name="divided" /&gt;

Cristina Kirchner also uses comparisons with historical events to support her policies. It has been stated by the historian [[Luis Alberto Romero]] that those comparisons are usually inaccurate and misleading, but most professional historians prefer to ignore them, and focus on her actual policies instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1823976-una-curiosa-interpretacion-del-pasado|title= Una curiosa interpretación del pasado|trans-title=A strange view of the past|language= Spanish|author= [[Luis Alberto Romero]]|date= September 1, 2015|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The media that promotes the "''Relato K''" is divided into three main groups. First is state-owned media, which is used solely by the governing party. Second is new, private media with very low audiences, which stays in business only due to the financial support of the government.&lt;ref name="M296" /&gt; Third is other private media that predated the Kirchnerite administrations and that eventually got aligned with it, also receiving financial support for doing so.&lt;ref name="M296"&gt;Mendelevich, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; Soccer broadcasting was nationalized in the program ''[[Fútbol para todos]]'', and then filled with pro-government advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303382004579131063662086126|title= Kirchner Moves Against Argentina's Free Press|author= Mary Anastasia O'Grady|date= October 13, 2013|publisher= The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of people hired to support the Kirchners at [[internet forum]]s and other [[virtual communities]].&lt;ref&gt;Mendelevich, pp. 52&amp;ndash;54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Kirchner was ranked by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as thirteenth on its list of the [[Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|100 most powerful women in the world]], being the second female head of government in the list below [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1044015|title=Cristina figura entre las más poderosas|publisher=Lanacion.com.ar|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 she rose to eleventh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1164485|title=Cristina, entre las 100 mujeres más poderosas|publisher=Lanacion.com.ar|date=18 August 2009|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2010 fell to sixty-eighth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1312516|title=La Presidenta quedó en el puesto 68 del listado de mujeres más poderosas del mundo|publisher=Lanacion.com.ar|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, she is listed as the nineteenth most influential woman in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/power-women/list/#tab:overall|title=The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|last=Howard|first=Caroline|work=[[Forbes]]|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she was ranked by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as fourth on its list of Top 10 Female Leaders of the World.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,2005455,00.html|title=Top 10 Female Leaders|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approval ratings and popular support===
Cristina Fernández was first elected [[President of Argentina]] following [[Argentine general election, 2007|2007 elections]], in which she scored 45.3% of the vote (8,651,066), nearly twice as much as her main opponent, [[Elisa Carrió]], of the center-right [[Civic Coalition ARI|ARI]] party, who garnered 23.0%. Throughout her first term, Cristina Fernández' [[approval ratings]] have varied significantly; when she took office, her popularity reportedly stood at 57.8%. By 2009, however, her approval had plummeted to a mere 23%,&lt;ref&gt;http://elpais.com/diario/2008/04/09/internacional/1207692007_850215.html&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector]]. Despite declining approval ratings in the middle of her first term, Cristina Férnandez went on to secure an outright victory in the [[Argentine general election, 2011]], securing 54.1% of the vote, and a record 11.9 million votes, soundly defeating the [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist]] [[Hermes Binner]], who obtained 16.8% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electionresources.org/ar/president.php?election=2011&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012, her approval ratings once again suffered a dip, this time to around 40%, while anti-government protests attracted 250,000–500,000 demonstrators in [[Buenos Aires]] in November that year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/09/argentiana-protests-rally-fernandez-kirchner&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Argentine legislative election, 2013|2013 mid-term elections]], the president's [[Justicialist Party]] suffered setbacks, dropping from 54% to 33% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-24690531&lt;/ref&gt; However, partly due to the [[staggered elections|staggered]] [[Elections in Argentina|electoral system in Argentina]], the government retained its majority in both [[Argentine National Congress|houses of congress]]. As she was barred from running for a third term in 2015 due to [[term limits]], Cristina Férnandez' handpicked successor, [[Daniel Scioli]], contested the [[Argentine general election, 2015]] on the Justicialist ticket.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/25/argentina-presidential-elections-2015-voters-polls&lt;/ref&gt; However, after 12 years of Kirchnerite rule, Scioli was narrowly defeated by the center-right [[Cambiemos]] candidate, [[Mauricio Macri]].&lt;ref&gt;https://next.ft.com/content/80f67520-9170-11e5-bd82-c1fb87bef7af&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of her eight-year reign, Cristina Férnandez enjoyed approval ratings above 50%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-34623236&lt;/ref&gt; According to some polls, however, her disapproval was only marginally lower than that, reinforcing Kirchner's image as a divisive leader.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perfil.com/politica/Una-encuesta-revela-quienes-son-los-politicos-con-mejor-imagen--20160119-0042.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2016, no longer being president, she became the politician with the highest disapproval ratings, alongside other members of her former cabinet. This was caused by the advances in the investigations of a big number of cases of political corruption that took place during her presidency, and her lack of activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1916249-elecciones-2017-imagen-politicos-bajo-la-lupa-de-los-encuestadores|title= Elecciones 2017: la imagen de Cristina, Macri y Carrió, bajo la lupa de los encuestadores|trans-title=Elections 2017: the image of Cristina, Macri and Carrió, under the lens of surveys|language= Spanish|author= Matías Moreno|date= July 7, 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:Cristina Fernandez, Gran Cuñado.jpg|thumb|Comedian [[Martín Bossi]] parodies the then Argentine president [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], next to TV host [[Marcelo Tinelli]].]]
[[Martín Bossi]] parodied Cristina Kirchner in 2009 at ''[[Gran Cuñado]]'' ({{lang-es|Big Brother-in-law}}), which featured parodies of Argentine politicians. The show itself was a parody of the ''[[Gran Hermano Argentina|Big Brother]]'' reality show &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.perfil.com/espectaculos/Martin-Bossi-el-hombre-que-hara-de-la-Presidenta-en-Gran-Cunado-es-el-nuevo-enemigo-de-los-Kirchner-20090322-0007.html|title= Martín Bossi, el hombre que hará de la Presidenta en "Gran Cuñado", es el nuevo enemigo de los Kirchner|trans-title=Martín Bossi, the man who will play the president at "Gran Cuñado"|language= Spanish|author= |date= March 22, 2009|publisher= Perfil|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bossi's masks were prepared by Andrés Parrilla and the scripts written by [[Nik]] and Pablo Semmartín. Bossio commented that he watched videos of Kirchner to prepare and that the main trait of the parody character, was that the character's face and words would suggest completely different things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2009/05/23/um/m-01924277.htm|title= Martín Bossi y Freddy Villarreal, el doble comando del humor político|trans-title=Martín Bossi and Freddy Villareal, the double command of political humor|language= Spanish|author= Fernanda Longo|date= May 22, 2009|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minister [[Anibal Fernandez]] criticized this parody, arguing that, "In some ways I think there were excesses, it should be regulated because it is the President, and other things, were very successful: we must be fair to those things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1127534-gran-cunado-sigue-desvelando-a-los-politicos|title= "Gran Cuñado" sigue desvelando a los políticos|trans-title=Gran Cuñado stills concerns the politicians|language= Spanish|author= |date= May 13, 2009|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, he recanted on the use of the word "regulate", but insisted that the presidential parody should be removed from the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1128516-anibal-fernandez-sugirio-sacar-a-la-presidenta-del-programa-de-tinelli|title= Aníbal Fernández sugirió sacar a la Presidenta del programa de Tinelli|trans-title=Aníbal Fernández suggested to remove the president from Tinelli's program|language= Spanish|author= |date= May 15, 2009|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program of investigative journalism ''[[Periodismo para todos]]'' opens with a [[stand-up comedy]] routine in which [[Jorge Lanata]] comments on the political events of the week. Actress [[Fátima Florez]] parodies Cristina Kirchner in these portions of the program. Florez began preparing her character in 2007, focusing on Kirchner's speaking style and hand movements. Florez uses a mask that takes three hours to apply. The parody, and Florez, became famous in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.parati.com.ar/lo-nuevo/personajes/fatima-florez/13097.html|title= Fátima Florez|trans-title=|language= Spanish|author= Agustina Andraia|date= June 2012|publisher= Para Tí|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later performed in theaters using the same character, focusing more on general humor than political satire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1496005-fatima-florez-si-mi-imitacion-no-le-hubiese-gustado-a-cristina-ya-me-lo-hubieran-hecho-saber|title= Fátima Florez: "Si a Cristina no le gustase la imitación, me lo habrían hecho saber"|trans-title=Fátima Florez: "If Cristina did not like my imitation, they would have already told me"|language= Spanish|author= Daniela Pérez González|date= August 7, 2012|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ray Goossens''' (14 August 1924 – 10 December 1998) was a [[Belgian people|Belgian]] artist, animator, writer, and director best known for creating the cartoon character [[Musti (character)|Musti]].

==Biography==
Ray Goossens was born in [[Merksem]], Belgium in 1924. Interested in animation from before [[World War II]], he founded the [[AFIM (animation studio)|AFIM]] animation studios with Henri Winkeler and Edmond Roex&lt;ref name="AFIM"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/goossens_ray.htm | accessdate = 2015-10-11 | title = Ray Goossens | publisher = Lambiek Comiclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1940.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} They had 15 employees, including later famous comics artists like [[Bob de Moor]] and [[Jef Nys]]. They created a number of short animated movies, of which ''[[Smidje Smee]]'' was the most successful.

After the war, Goossens started working as a comics creator with ''[[Kleine Zondagsvriend]]'', a weekly youth magazine. He created a number of series, some based on existing stories like ''[[Tijl Uilenspiegel]]'' and ''[[Reynard cycle|Reinaert de Vos]]'', some new like ''Tsjoem'' (a parrot) and ''Snops en de bende''. He also worked as an illustrator for different newspapers and magazines, including ''[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]''.

He worked as an animator mainly for client's publicity purposes, and in 1957 became [[artistic director]] of [[Belvision]], the new animation studios of [[Le Lombard]], one of the major Belgian comics publishers. At first, they created series based on existing comics series like ''[[Oumpah-pah]]'', ''[[Hergé's Adventures of Tintin]]'' or ''[[Raymond Macherot#Chlorophylle|Chlorophylle]]''. They also made the full-length movie ''[[Pinocchio in Outer Space]]''.

From 1956 to 1969 he worked as an independent animator and director. In 1967 he directed ''[[Asterix the Gaul (film)|Asterix the Gaul]]'', the first feature film based on this comic, and in 1968 he joined [[Dupuis]], where he created with the animation studios a number of children's series like ''[[Tip en Tap]]'', ''[[De Pili's]]'' and ''[[Musti (TV series)|Musti]]'', which was based on a character he had already created in 1945. He also directed a series based on the adventures of ''[[Boule et Bill]]''.

From 1976 onwards, Ray Goossens taught animation at the [[R.I.T.C.S]] in Brussels. His final success as a director followed in 1980, with ''[[Plons de gekke kikker]]''.

Ray Goossens died in 1998 in [[Deurne, Belgium|Deurne]].

'''Robert K. Heuberger''' (12 January 1922&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.winterthur-glossar.ch/app/default/pub/fw.action/wine.article?ce_id=345&amp;ce_name=person |title=Robert K.

== Life and career ==
Heuberger grew up in poor circumstances. He completed his training at the [[Credit Suisse|Swiss Volksbank]] in [[Aarburg]] in the 1930s. As a bank and insurance buyer, he later worked for the Volksbank as an accountant, credit manager and securities specialist, then as an agency manager for the [[Bâloise]] insurance company.

Together with his wife Ruth, born Mötteli (* 1924, † 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todesanzeigenportal.ch/todesanzeige/Ruth/Lina/Heuberger/M%C3%B6tteli/ |title=Trauerfall Heuberger Ruth Lina |date=9 October 2016 |publisher=Todesanzeigenportal Schweiz |access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heuberger founded Siska Heuberger Holding AG in 1954, with which he implemented a series of major building projects, especially in eastern Switzerland, with the construction of about 1000 apartments in [[Winterthur]]. According to the economic magazine's [[BILANZ]], he had assets of approximately CHF300 to 500 million in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aus-dem-leben-eines-tycoons-1.18223917 |title=Aus dem Leben eines Tycoons |author=Marc Tribelhorn |date=18 January 2014 |publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the father of the media entrepreneur, Günther Heuberger, and father of Rainer Heuberger, old [[Cantonal Council of Zürich]] ([[Swiss People's Party|SVP]]) and owner of Siska Verwaltungs AG&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jungunternehmer-preis.ch/2013/dokumente/Berichterstattung_NZZaS_130623.pdf |title=Überschätze dich selbst! |author=Marco Metzler |date=23 June 2013 |publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engagement ==
Heuberger's public commitment includes funding for the establishment of the [[Club of Rome]] in Winterthur, setting up the non-profit «Robert and Ruth Heuberger Foundation», as well as founding an innovation prize for young entrepreneurs. In 2007, the City of Winterthur awarded him the prize of the "Winterthur Lion". In 2013, Heuberger drew attention to the initiative to abolish conscription by means of double-page advertisements. The referendum was clearly rejected.

== Honors ==
The asteroid [[82232&amp;nbsp;Heuberger]], discovered by [[Markus Griesser (astronomer)|Markus Griesser]] at the Swiss [[Eschenberg Observatory]] in 2001, has been named in honor of Robert and Ruth Heuberger's commitment to social and cultural institutions.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;  The official naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 13 July 2004 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 52327}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

'''Steven Fielding''' (born 17 October 1960) is a former Australian [[Australian Senate|senator]] for the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and the former federal [[parliamentary leader]] of the [[Family First Party]]. He was elected to the upper house at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]] on two per cent of the [[first-preference votes]].&lt;ref name="Gordon2008-09-28" /&gt; He failed to gain re-election at the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]]. His term ended on 30 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/family-firsts-steve-fielding-loses-senate-seat-20100916-15ebv.html Family First's Steve Fielding loses Senate seat: The Age 16 September 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-election/ballarat-blacksmith-forges-ahead-with-nod-to-dlp-heroes-20100822-13axy.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Ballarat blacksmith forges ahead with nod to DLP heroes | first=Barney | last=Zwartz | date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2010/guide/senate-results.htm 2010 Senate Results – Summary: ABC elections]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Fielding was born on 17 October 1960, in [[Melbourne]], where he was raised in the suburb of [[Reservoir, Victoria|Reservoir]]. His parents, Shirley and George Fielding, had a large family consisting of 16 children, and Fielding spent much of his childhood sharing a bedroom with five brothers in the family's three-bedroom home.&lt;ref name="Cadzow2005-10-08"&gt;{{cite news | last = Cadzow | first = Jane | date = 8 October 2005 | title = Meet the Fieldings | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | location = Sydney, Australia | page = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His early education was at the local Keon Park Primary School, He later attended the nearby [[Merrilands High School]].&lt;ref name="Fielding"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2009 | title = About Steve | work = Senator Steve Fielding | url = http://www.stevefielding.com.au/about/ | accessdate = 29 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academically, Fielding suffered setbacks through an undiagnosed case of [[dyslexia]], and this led to problems studying subjects such as English.&lt;ref name="Riley2009-09-27"&gt;{{cite news | last = Riley | first = Robyn | date = 27 September 2009 | title = Time to get 'fiskal' – Funding calls on dyslexia | work = [[Herald Sun]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | page = 102 }} His dyslexia was only diagnosed after he revealed his learning difficulties in 2009, and he was diagnosed as suffering from both [[Apraxia#Apraxia of speech|developmental apraxia of speech]] and [[Augmentative and alternative communication#Developmental dyspraxia|developmental surface dyspraxia]], along with the dyslexia.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he excelled in mathematics, and his high marks in this subject allowed him to graduate with sufficiently high scores to gain entry into the [[Bachelor of Engineering]] degree at [[RMIT University|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] (RMIT), where he studied [[electronic engineering]].&lt;ref name="Cadzow2005-10-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fielding2009-09-13"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fielding | first = Steve | date = 13 September 2009 | title = A learning disability doesn't have to limit who you are | work = [[The Age|The Sunday Age]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | page = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduating in 1983, Fielding accepted a position at [[Hewlett-Packard]], and later he moved into management at technology firms [[NEC]] and [[Siemens]].&lt;ref name="Fielding" /&gt;

Fielding returned to university to undertake a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) at [[Monash University]], completing it in 1992. He later moved to [[Wellington]], New Zealand, where he worked for [[Telecom New Zealand]] in "change management" during a difficult time for the industry, as it was undergoing [[deregulation]].&lt;ref name="Fielding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bachelard2004-11-06"&gt;{{cite news | last = Bachelard | first = Michael | date = 6 November 2004 | title = Not a hellfire and brimstone man | work = [[The Australian|The Weekend Australian]] | location = Sydney, Australia | page = 21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Australia three years later, in 1995, and worked for [[United Energy]], the Australian [[Yellow Pages]] and as a [[marketing manager]] at [[Vision Super]].&lt;ref name="Cadzow2005-10-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fielding" /&gt;

Fielding entered politics in 2003 when he successfully stood as an independent candidate for the [[Knox City Council]].&lt;ref name="Cadzow2005-10-08" /&gt; He has described the decision to stand as "very last-minute", but others, such as the mayor of the council, Jenny Moore, and then Victorian [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Peter Lockwood]], said Fielding was very open about his intent to move into federal politics.&lt;ref name="Cadzow2005-10-08" /&gt; Either way, both Lockwood and Labor MP [[Bob Stensholt]] have described how Fielding later made inquiries about the possibility of running for one of the major parties before joining Family First.&lt;ref name="Cadzow2005-10-08" /&gt;

==2004 election==

Fielding was elected to represent Victoria in the Senate at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]]. He was the first representative of Family First to be elected to the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Green2005-08-10"&gt;{{cite news | last = Green | first = Jonathan | date = 10 August 2005 | title = Tears and cheers at Family First man's debut | work = [[The Age]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding's election was not expected – Family First had only been founded two years before the election, and it was not expected to succeed in its first federal election in Victoria.&lt;ref name="Cadzow2005-10-08" /&gt; Like many senators, Fielding gained a quota under the Senate's [[proportional representation]] system by receiving preferences from other parties (see [[Australian electoral system]]). The [[Australian Democrats]] and the [[Australian Labor Party]] agreed to swap preferences with Family First. But Fielding benefited from the larger-than-expected surplus of [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] preferences, and stayed in the count long enough to receive Democrat and Labor preferences, defeating the [[Australian Greens]]' candidate [[David Risstrom]] for the last Senate place in Victoria.&lt;ref name="GreenElection2004"&gt;{{cite news | last = Green | first = Anthony | title = Final Victoria Senate Results | work = Australia Votes: Federal Election | date=9 October 2004 | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | url = http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/results/sendVIC.htm | accessdate = 26 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Fielding was elected although his party as a whole received just 56,376 votes (1.9%) for the Senate in Victoria.&lt;ref name="Gordon2008-09-28"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/fielding-first-one-man-one-vote-and-a-whole-lot-of-power-20080927-4pdz.html?deviceType=text|title=Fielding first: one man, one vote ... and a whole lot of power|last=Gordon|first=Josh|date=28 September 2008|work=[[The Age|The Sunday Age]]|location=Melbourne, Australia|page=14|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When first elected, the [[Howard Government]] held a slim majority in the Senate, sufficient that Fielding would only hold the balance of power if one of the government senators chose to [[Crossing the floor|cross the floor]].&lt;ref name="Cadzow2005-10-08" /&gt; This changed after the 2007 federal election (the changes of which took effect in 2008), when the balance of power in the Senate shifted to a combination of Fielding, the five Australian Greens senators and independent [[Nick Xenophon]].&lt;ref name="Gordon2008-09-28" /&gt;

==Federal politics==
While Family First is generally regarded as a [[Conservatism|conservative]] party, Fielding stated he would not be an automatic supporter of the then [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] opposition in the Senate. On some issues which he saw as affecting the wellbeing of families, such as the [[WorkChoices]] industrial relations policies, he indicated disagreement with government policies. In February 2009, he told a Senate hearing that he believed divorce added to the impact of [[global warming]] because it resulted in people switching to a "resource-inefficient lifestyle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Divorce adds to the impact of global warming – Steve Fielding | date=25 February 2009 | work =The Daily Telegraph |location=Australia | url =http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/money/story/0,26860,25102743-5015795,00.html | accessdate = 25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balance of power===
With some [[backbenchers]] being willing to [[cross the floor]], Fielding's vote was important on some of the Howard government's more controversial legislation. His vote ensured the passage of [[Voluntary student unionism]],&lt;ref name="theage.com.au"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Graffiti-attack-on-Family-First-office/2005/12/10/1134086840993.html Graffiti Attack on Steve Fielding's Office After VSU Vote], ''The Age'', 10 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the overturning of [[civil unions]] legislation in the [[Australian Capital Territory]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1664191.htm Bid to save ACT civil unions fails], ''PM'', 15 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and changes to media ownership laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1763643.htm Media laws pass the Senate], ''PM'', 12 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, his intention to vote "no" ensured the defeat of the Howard government's proposed tightening of asylum seeker laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2006/s1714861.htm Backbench rebellion forces border protection backdown], ''Lateline'', 14 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change===
In mid-2009, Fielding flew to the US on a self-funded trip to discover more about climate change. He came back unconvinced that man-made carbon dioxide emissions were the main driver of climate change. He subsequently voted against the Rudd Government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Fielding also attended the Copenhagen Climate Conference in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kippist |first=Lucy |url=http://www.thepunch.com.au/articles/the-real-reason-ill-fight-in-the-senate-on-climate-change/ |title=The real reason I'll fight in the Senate on climate change &amp;#124; Article |publisher=The Punch |accessdate=2 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614010838/http://www.thepunch.com.au/articles/the-real-reason-ill-fight-in-the-senate-on-climate-change/ |archivedate=14 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth allowance===
In 2009 Fielding teamed up with the coalition to defeat the government's proposed changes to the youth allowance system. He said the changes were unfair to rural and regional students and that it would leave 26,000 students worse off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/25/2752552.htm |title=Senate blocks youth allowance changes – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===
Fielding opposed the Rudd Government's alcopops tax. He argued that taxing ready to drink alcohol beverages wouldn't put an end to binge drinking. He campaigned for the government to act against the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kippist |first=Lucy |url=http://www.thepunch.com.au/articles/drunk-nation1/ |title=Our drunk nation &amp;#124; Article |publisher=The Punch |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimulus package===
Following the global financial crisis the Rudd Government passed an economic stimulus package with the help of Family First. As part of the deal Fielding secured a $200&amp;nbsp;million jobs fund called 'Get Communities Working'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/Committee/fapa_ctte/stimulus_package/report/d03.htm |title=Parliament of Australia:Senate:Committees:Finance and Public Administration Committee:Nation Building and Jobs Plan – Inquiry into the provisions of the Appropriation (Nation Building and Jobs) Bill (No. 1) 2008–2009 and 5 related bills – $PageTitle$ |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date=12 February 2009 |accessdate=2 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809042448/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/Committee/fapa_ctte/stimulus_package/report/d03.htm |archivedate=9 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary Student Unionism===
At the end of his campaign in support of the Howard government's Voluntary Student Unionism legislation, which was passed, the walls of Fielding's office were vandalised with pro-union graffiti.&lt;ref name="theage.com.au"/&gt;

===Luxury car tax===
An increase to the luxury car tax was defeated in the Senate on 4 September 2008, with Fielding joining the [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]] in blocking the budget legislation. It was passed after Fielding negotiated exemptions for farmers and tourism operators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/09/17/2367134.htm http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/09/17/2367134.htm], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news, 17 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Considered changing parties===
In early 2008, Fielding reportedly considered breaking away from Family First to establish a new political party, inviting [[Tim Costello]] and other "big names" to join him.&lt;ref name="HeraldSun300908"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24423234-661,00.html |title=Senator Steve Fielding wanted to quit |author=Ben Packham and Peter Jean |work=[[Herald Sun]] |date=30 September 2008 |accessdate=11 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202045620/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24423234-661,00.html |archivedate=2 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The revelations came after Fielding changed his position on abortion, after being rebuffed by his party for taking a softer approach.&lt;ref name="HeraldSun270908"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24408444-662,00.html |title=Family First Senator Steve Fielding retreats from abortion comments |author=Ben Packham |work=[[Herald Sun]] |date=27 September 2008 |accessdate=11 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317070633/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24408444-662,00.html |archivedate=17 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ISP level content filtering===
Fielding gave conditional support to the mandatory ISP level filtering scheme. A spokesperson for Family First indicated that the party would want X18+ rated and refused classification (RC) content banned for everyone, including adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/biztech/net-filters-may-block-porn-and-fetish-sites/2008/10/27/1224955916155.html Net filters may block porn and gambling sites], ''The Age'', 27 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Fielding's support for [[Internet censorship in Australia]] was not reported on his official website.

===Same-sex marriage===
Fielding has compared same-sex marriages to incest:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/fielding-likens-same-sex-marriage-to-incest-20091126-juo3.html |title=Fielding likens same-sex marriage to incest |work=The Age |accessdate=26 November 2009 | location=Melbourne | first=Misha | last=Schubert | date=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A bloke cannot marry his brother; it is not right. A woman cannot marry their sister; it is not right. A bloke cannot marry a bloke because it is not right, and a female cannot marry a female because it is not right. I don't support this.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Paid Parental Leave Scheme===

In June 2010, during the Senate discussion on the proposed [[Parental leave|Paid Parental Leave Scheme]], Fielding suggested "some women may rort the scheme by deliberately falling pregnant and then having a late-term abortion". He was subsequently criticised by all sides of Australian politics for these comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/06/17/2929288.htm |title=Fielding's abortion rorts claim 'offensive'|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=17 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===

Fielding introduced the following legislation into Parliament:&lt;ref&gt;http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/billslst/billslst_c5cb7dfd-6ea5-42d2-bea7-a4c40e628ce8/upload_pdf/Bills%20List%202009.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22family%20first%22{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stunts==
Fielding's use of publicity stunts was commented on by ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/why-steve-fielding-bothers/2008/09/25/1222217430711.html |title=Mr 2%: why Steve Fielding bothers: SMH 26/8/2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=25 September 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/note-to-steve-forget-the-stunts/2008/09/06/1220121597553.html?page=fullpage |title=Note to Steve: forget the stunts: SMH 7/9/2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=7 September 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in May 2008, he joined protesting pensioners, who brought traffic to a standstill in the Melbourne CBD, when he and others took their shirts off in the style of the cab drivers who had successfully stripped for increased cab security, to demand $70- to $100-a-week rise in the pension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.theage.com.au/world/ageing-aussies-strip-in-pension-protest-20080516-2ezb.html |title=Ageing Aussies strip in pension protest – Breaking News – World – Breaking News |work=The Age |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livenews.com.au/Articles/2008/05/16/Pensioners_strip_during_pay_protest LIVENEWS.com.au &gt; National &gt; Pensioners strip during pay protest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517174903/http://livenews.com.au/Articles/2008/05/16/Pensioners_strip_during_pay_protest |date=17 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sweet Grass''' (also '''Sweetgrass''' or '''Wikaskokiseyin''' or '''Wihaskokiseyin''') ([[Circa|c.]]1815 &amp;ndash; on or shortly before January 11, 1877) was a chief of the [[Cree]] in the 1860s and 1870s in western Canada. He worked with other chiefs and bands to participate in raids with enemy tribes. While a chief, Sweet Grass noticed the starvation and economic hardship the Cree were facing. This propelled him to work with the Canadian and eventually sign [[Treaty 6|Treaty Six]]. Sweet Grass believed that working alongside the government was one of the only solutions to the daily hardship the Cree were faced with. The Sweet Grass Reserve west of Battleford, Saskatchewan was named in his honor and is still functioning today.

==Life==

===Early life===

Sweet Grass or Wikaskokiseyin was born in a Cree Camp in the area near [[Fort Pitt Provincial Park|Fort Pitt, Saskatchewan]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Big Bear: The End of Freedom|last=Dempsey|first=Hugh|publisher=University of Regina Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date and place of his birth is unrecorded. His mother was kidnapped during a war with the Cree from a tribe, which was located around Missouri.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/wikaskokiseyin_abraham_10E.html|title=Biography – WIKASKOKISEYIN, ABRAHAM – Volume X (1871-1880) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, Sweet Grass was not Cree and was Crow.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7UBUF3X5QPQC|title=Big Bear: The End of Freedom|last=Dempsey|first=Hugh A.|date=2006|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889771963|location=|pages=29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of his father. Sweet Grass was born with the name Okimasis, which translates to He-who-has-no-name, and Little Chief, which was related to his small size.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nuQ7W7x1MSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cuthand,+Doug.+Askiwina:+A+Cree+World.+Regina,+Saskatchewan:+Coteau+Books.+2007.#v=onepage&amp;q=sweetgrass&amp;f=false|title=Askiwina: A Cree World|last=Cuthand|first=Doug|date=2007-04-03|publisher=Coteau Books|isbn=9781550505054|location=|pages=42|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warriors consistently taunted him due to his stature within the village.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His name, “Sweet Grass” was inspired by an audacious feat that he attempted as a youth. He ventured into the Blackfoot territory, completely alone with the goal of capturing a heard of horses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Approaching the pasture, he hid in a bush and as a man advanced towards him, he took out his bow, killed and scalped him; proceeding to raid the pasture to return forty horses back to his tribe.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His tribe was presented with a collection of grass dipped in the blood of the man he had killed.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; This was met with chants of “Sweet Grass”, which would eventually become his name as a Chief in 1870. Later that year, Sweet Grass converted to Roman Catholicism by Father Albert Lacombe and was baptized with the Christian name, Abraham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/wikaskokiseyin_abraham_10E.html|title=Biography – WIKASKOKISEYIN, ABRAHAM – Volume X (1871-1880) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cree Childhood===

Due to the fact that Sweet Grass' Mother was captured by a Cree tribe, it is unknown if she partook in the established birthing and naming traditions. However, the Cree had a process to which they named their children. The father of the child would ask Cree Shamans with spiritual powers to help with the naming process.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0807Uclx7bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David Goodman|date=1940|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770133|location=|pages=141|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shaman's decision would be based on a character or incident that they saw in their vision.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Once a name was decided, the child was passed around the group where each individual blessed the child.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This ceremony generally took place when the child reached the age of one.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; From this moment on, a special bond was formed between the child and whoever named them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There is no record of whether Sweet Grass and his mother took part in this ceremony. However, this likely happened because he was born in a Cree Camp. Children typically lived a carefree and adventurous childhood.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Children did not wear much clothing and boys wore nothing until the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0807Uclx7bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David Goodman|date=1940|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770133|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children did not spend much time with their parents growing up, rather with their grandparents.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0807Uclx7bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David Goodman|date=1940|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770133|location=|pages=143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweet Grass’ childhood most likely went against this Cree norm because of his Mother’s capture. Young men would attach themselves to a hunter or warrior that they admired and followed or shadowed them in performing tasks.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Sweet Grass most likely did not partake in this tradition or many other childhood ones. The raid of horses on the Blackfoot may have been an attempt to prove his worth to the tribe and seek their acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7UBUF3X5QPQC|title=Big Bear: The End of Freedom|last=Dempsey|first=Hugh A.|date=2006|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889771963|location=|pages=43|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cree===

The Cree were located in the plains of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0807Uclx7bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David Goodman|date=1940|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770133|location=|pages=7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cree are divided into several different tribes in Saskatchewan and Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0807Uclx7bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David Goodman|date=1940|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770133|location=|pages=9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Cree represents a general ethnic group, however, there are several different tribes based on region and dialect. When Sweet Grass was chief, the different bands of the Cree were loose in a wide-ranging areas and usually named for the territory in which they operated&lt;ref name=" Mandelbaum 1940 105"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0807Uclx7bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David Goodman|date=1940|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770133|location=|pages=105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not uncommon for different bands to hunt and perform rituals together as seen with Sweet Grass’ relationship with [[Big Bear]]. Families had the ability to break away from their current band and join another elsewhere.&lt;ref name=" Mandelbaum 1940 105"/&gt; Cree societies were split into different roles, such as the Chief, which was the title Sweet Grass held. There were also village elders and warriors. There typically was a large number of warriors within a band and these men held extremely high prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0807Uclx7bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David Goodman|date=1940|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770133|location=|pages=111|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cree religion believed in a single powerful creator which they based their ideology and ceremonies on.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0807Uclx7bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David Goodman|date=1940|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770133|location=|pages=157|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure held no real identity and did not appear to anyone in visions or contact.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, this almighty creator appeared to individuals through various sprits such as the bear and horse.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Sweet Grass’ spiritual helper was the mosquito, which he would often seek for guidance.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; He believed that the insect had taken pity on him which guided him to become a chief.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; The Cree believe that the creator spirit was in every living thing around them.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0807Uclx7bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David Goodman|date=1940|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770133|location=|pages=157–158|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual acquired a spiritual helper after they appeared to them in a vision.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This spirit did not provide aid or direct help in anyway but instead provided guidance.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The Cree believe that every individual has a soul which is located at the back of their neck.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0807Uclx7bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David Goodman|date=1940|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770133|location=|pages=158|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soul was able to leave the body during visions where it would accompany their spiritual helper.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; After death, the soul would wonder the earth for four days, and then would travel to the land of the dead, which was believed to be in the Milky Way.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Position as Chief===

The position of chief within the Cree varied from tribe to tribe and each had varying levels of authority over the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David|publisher=Canadian Plains Research Center|year=1979|isbn=978-0-88977-013-3|location=Regina|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiefs within Cree society were chosen by the consent of the band. While it sometimes would go the to the eldest son of the previous chief, an incompetent man would not be given the position. A chief needed to be an active leader both in peace and war. It was required to distinguish themselves during a war, as a provider, and as a generous giver to gain this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David|publisher=Canadian Plains Research Center|year=1979|isbn=978-0-88977-013-3|location=Regina|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most vital contributions of a chief was to keep the peace during the day to day living by settling arguments between the other members of the band. Sweet Grass understood the sacrifices that needed to be made for the bettering of the band. During one hunt Sweetgrass's horse was unable to remain calm, which was affecting the hunting of buffalo. Despite it being a highly valuable horse Sweetgrass traded it for an inferior one, understanding the importance of the group over the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David|publisher=Canadian Plains Research Centre|year=1979|isbn=978-0-88977-013-3|location=Regina|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not uncommon for there to be more than one chief who would have various levels of prestige. The amount of power wielded by Cree chiefs varied from person to person. Sweet Grass during the signing of the treaty was one of the most well-regarded plains Cree chiefs and was given a position of importance during negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Big Bear: End of Freedom|last=Hugh|first=Dempsey|publisher=University of Regina Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Regina|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Big Bear===

Sweet Grass often worked closely with the fellow Cree chief Big Bear. They hunted in the same territory and would often hunt and camp together.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; Sweet Grass was ten years older, so Big Bear recognized him as the superior chief.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; They bonded over sharing the characteristic of being small, but mighty warriors.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; Moreover, Big Bear was part Ojibwa which meant both chiefs were not completely Cree.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; Big Bear admired Sweet Grass for his bravery and guidance that he would often receive from his spiritual helper.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; Both Chiefs would work together in multiple raids on the Blackfoot. An example of this would be when Sweet Grass and Big Bear assembled 18 Cree warriors that attempted to raid Blackfoot hunting territory.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; After being forced to set up camp along a river due to a snow storm, a member of their war party left to collect food and spotted a lone member of the Blackfoot on foot rounding up horses.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; Upon reporting his sighting back to the others, they decide to kill the man and steal his horses.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7UBUF3X5QPQC|title=Big Bear: The End of Freedom|last=Dempsey|first=Hugh A.|date=2006|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889771963|location=|pages=30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attempted raid went wrong as Sweet Grass and Big Bear nearly stumbled upon Blackfoot main camp.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Days of fighting ensued however, both chiefs managed to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7UBUF3X5QPQC|title=Big Bear: The End of Freedom|last=Dempsey|first=Hugh A.|date=2006|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889771963|location=|pages=31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buffalo Hunting and Fur Trade===

Buffalo hunting and fur trading were a vital part of Cree survival. Cree Tribes would move according to their migration habits. At the beginning of 1870, buffalo were plentiful within the plains.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0807Uclx7bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David Goodman|date=1940|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770133|location=|pages=51|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, there were hundreds of thousands, which provided an immense amount of resources for the Cree to a point where they were able to only take the choice parts of the Buffalo.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; However, as European settlers came to the plains, that number dwindled significantly. In 1881, there was only a couple hundred Buffalo left within the plains.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The Cree relied on the buffalo so heavily that they were pushed to a point of starvation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Additionally, as the Hudson’s Bay Company moved into the prairies, the fur trade offered an extremely important source of income and goods for the Cree. However, over-trapping forced tribes to move west to find suitable forest areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0807Uclx7bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: An Ethnographic, Historical, and Comparative Study|last=Mandelbaum|first=David Goodman|date=1940|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770133|location=|pages=261|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of trapping territory, along with the decline of the buffalo left the Cree helpless. Both of these issues became an extremely important topic discussed in treaty negotiations which Sweet Grass was heavily involved in.

===Cree Religious Conversion===

Different tribes of the Cree held their own stories and traditions passed down orally through the generations. As Europeans began to set up colonies in North America, missionaries went among the indigenous people to spread their religion. While traditions within tribes remained significant, the Cree became more receptive to different denominations of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Big Bear: End of Freedom|last=Dempsey|first=Hugh|publisher=University of Regina Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Regina|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852 the priest [[Albert Lacombe|Father Lacombe]] moved to the [[Red River Colony]] with plans to live with the Metis and Cree. His goal was to spread the Roman Catholic faith to the Western parts of Canada. During this time Lacombe would become familiar with the Cree language and the culture, even writing a Cree dictionary in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Father Lacombe: Black Robe Voyageur|last=Hughes|first=Katherine|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|year=1920|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1860s he moved farther west and would come into contact with Sweet Grass and his band. With diseases and famine rampant in the Cree community, they were more receptive to new religious ideas. It was due to both Lacombe's understanding of Cree culture and the growing desperation of the Cree, he would be able to convert many of the Cree to the Roman Catholic faith. Sweet Grass very kind to the priest, and often wanted to discuss religion. In 1870 Sweetgrass allowed himself to be baptized and was given the name Abraham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Father Lacombe: Black Robe Voyageur|last=Hughes|first=Katherine|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|year=1920|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with Canadian Government ==
Throughout the 19th century, it appeared as though the federal government of Canada, situated in Ottawa, worked very hard to increase the dependency that aboriginal people had on it. The government wanted tribes to become more democratic in its governing of the reserves and rely less on the chiefs who traditionally were the leaders of the community.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niemi-Bohun|first=Melanie|title=Colonial Categories and Familial Responses to Treaty and Metis Scrip Policy: The 'Edmonton and District Stragglers,' 1870–88|journal=Canadian Historical Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=1|pages=71–98|doi=10.3138/chr.90.1.71|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, this angered many indigenous communities who were more inclined to fight back than work with the government. Sweet Grass was one of the Chiefs who was more willing to work with them. One of the requests that Sweet Grass made to the government was to teach the Cree better farming techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OhVWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=Wikaskokiseyin#v=onepage&amp;q=Wikaskokiseyin&amp;f=false|title=Illustrated History of Canada's Native People, Fourth Edition: I Have Lived Here Since the World Began|last=Ray|first=Arthur J.|date=2016-05-01|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=9780773599581|location=|pages=209|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was that the government should stop supplying weapons to the Blackfeet who were his tribe’s enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/wikaskokiseyin_abraham_10E.html|title=Biography – WIKASKOKISEYIN, ABRAHAM – Volume X (1871-1880) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were just a few of the aspects that Sweet Grass worked with the government on. The overall goal that Sweet Grass wanted to achieve was an end to factionalism that had been plaguing the Plains Cree for years.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Sweet Grass’ hope to work with the federal government was challenged by other prominent Cree leaders.

At the time when Sweet Grass was Chief, The Canadian government had pictured what the Indigenous communities were and never changed them.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niemi-Bohun|first=Melanie|title=Colonial Categories and Familial Responses to Treaty and Metis Scrip Policy: The 'Edmonton and District Stragglers,' 1870–88|journal=Canadian Historical Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=1|pages=71–98|doi=10.3138/chr.90.1.71|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of thinking immediately damaged Indigenous communities as they were self-governing cultures that evolved much like any other.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Sweet Grass along with three other Chiefs attempted to get ahead of government control by meeting with the representative of the Canadian government in the west Lieutenant Governor Archibald to petition the Hudson’s Bay Company’s (HBC) sale of land to the government.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qboeDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=treaty+6#v=snippet&amp;q=wikaskokiseyin&amp;f=false|title=From Treaties to Reserves: The Federal Government and Native Peoples in Territorial Alberta, 1870-1905|last=Hall|first=D.

Sweet Grass had also requested that the government provide supplies as needed so that they may sustain themselves when traditional hunting was not an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qboeDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=treaty+6#v=snippet&amp;q=wikaskokiseyin&amp;f=false|title=From Treaties to Reserves: The Federal Government and Native Peoples in Territorial Alberta, 1870-1905|last=Hall|first=D.

=== Treaty 6 ===
Treaty 6 was the biggest piece of legislation between Plains Cree Leaders and the colonial government. Signed in 1876, Treaty 6 was the agreement between the government of Canada and the Indigenous people living in parts of modern-day Saskatchewan and Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9Uae4mTTyYYC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=canada's+treaty+6#v=onepage&amp;q=alberta&amp;f=false|title=Aboriginal and Treaty Rights in Canada: Essays on Law, Equity, and Respect for Difference|last=Asch|first=Michael|date=1997|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=9780774805810|location=|pages=182|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweet Grass’ beliefs clashed with that of Big Bear who believed that a Confederacy needed to be formed as a united front in order to get the best terms for all.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howells|first=Coral|date=Winter 1982|title=History from a Different Angle: Narrative Strategies in The Temptations of Big Bear|url=http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/resolve/00219894/v17i0001/161_3hfadaittobb.xml|journal=The Journal of Commonwealth Literature|volume=17 |issue=1|pages=165|via=Scholars Portal Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be fair to Big Bear, he was mindful of what the government promised as he was not invited to the original negotiation and signing of Treaty 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aboriginal and Treaty Rights in Canada|last=Venne|first=Sharon|work=|publisher=UBC Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=181|chapter=Understanding Treaty 6: An Indigenous Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Treaty 6 did deliver was more division and segregation between European settlers and Indigenous people. Indigenous people were forced to choose between living on reserves, receiving a fixed amount of money every year for the rest of their lives and trying to assimilate and lose their status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niemi-Bohun|first=Melanie|title=Colonial Categories and Familial Responses to Treaty and Metis Scrip Policy: The 'Edmonton and District Stragglers,' 1870–88|journal=Canadian Historical Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=1|pages=71–98|doi=10.3138/chr.90.1.71|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language used to refer to indigenous people who elected to not settle on reserves also did not help ease tensions. The specific word used was “stragglers” which gave the impression that the government did not see these people as any more than falling behind in Canada’s idealized picture of what life of Indigenous people would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niemi-Bohun|first=Melanie|title=Colonial Categories and Familial Responses to Treaty and Metis Scrip Policy: The 'Edmonton and District Stragglers,' 1870–88|journal=Canadian Historical Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=1|pages=71–98|doi=10.3138/chr.90.1.71|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unpreparedness or perhaps unwillingness of the Canadian government to deal with the problems of indigenous peoples continued long after the signing of Treaty 6 but it was Sweet Grass’ firm belief that this was the best way to ensure that indigenous culture survived.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

== Tribal Conflict ==
The signing of Treaty 6 was not the only reason for conflict between the Cree and other prominent Indigenous tribes in the region. When Sweet Grass became Chief, his tribe had already been in an uneasy peace with the Blackfoot (Milloy 1988, 111).&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b_Cp9kGUvuwC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: Trade, Diplomacy, and War, 1790 to 1870|last=Milloy|first=John S.|date=May 1990|publisher=Univ. of Manitoba Press|isbn=9780887553837|location=|pages=111|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweet Grass had endeavored to maintain this peace even though many of his people resented it. As stated previously, part of what the Cree wanted to be reflected by the terms of Treaty 6 was an end to the factionalism that had pitted the younger members of the Cree community against the older Indigenous Leadership.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The result of this factionalism was the revival of conflict between Sweet Grass’ tribe and the Blackfeet. The peak of the conflict came in 1861 when the Blackfoot had threatened to kill any Cree, Metis, or a white man that they stumbled upon.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Whenever a Cree war party was formed to go hunting in Blackfoot territory, caution had to be exercised, especially after the threat had been established.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Sweet Grass and Big Bear had formed a war party for this exact purpose as stated previously. Sweet Grass himself killed a Blackfoot Chief who had been using a hollow tree as a shield by shooting through it and piercing his heart.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Although it is not impossible, it is highly unlikely that the Cree escaped from their entrapment with as few casualties as they claimed.

The Plains Cree were not always the victims of this conflict. In 1860, a member of the Plains Cree killed a Blackfoot chief which had sparked a war against them.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Although it is not known which of the Cree Chiefs supported an unexpected attack on a Blackfoot Chief, it is known that Sweet Grass was not among them. They had sent a war party to a Blackfoot camp and killed 18 Blackfeet in addition to stealing horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b_Cp9kGUvuwC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: Trade, Diplomacy, and War, 1790 to 1870|last=Milloy|first=John S.|date=May 1990|publisher=Univ. of Manitoba Press|isbn=9780887553837|location=|pages=111–112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Plains Cree simply could not accept peace with the Blackfoot. In another instance, Sweet Grass had invited the Blackfoot into his camp in an attempt to begin a long-standing peace with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TytLkRXvkWEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=voices+of+the+plains+cree#v=onepage&amp;q=voices%20of%20the%20plains%20cree&amp;f=false|title=Voices of the Plains Cree|last=Ahenakew|first=Edward|date=1973|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=9780889770836|location=|pages=34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this was more hostility from his people who had harassed Sweet Grass’ Blackfoot guests. In 1862, Sweet Grass accompanied Broken Arm, who was known for his ability to broker peace, along with fifty escorts to finally make peace with the Blackfoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b_Cp9kGUvuwC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Plains Cree: Trade, Diplomacy, and War, 1790 to 1870|last=Milloy|first=John S.|date=May 1990|publisher=Univ. of Manitoba Press|isbn=9780887553837|location=|pages=112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As history has demonstrated, peace between the Blackfoot and the Plains Cree does not last very long. Even after Treaty 6 was signed, the Blackfoot and Plains Cree continued to quarrel over hunting as the number of buffalo faded with each passing year.

==Death==

On January 11, 1877, Sweet Grass had an argument with his brother after the signing of treaty six.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nuQ7W7x1MSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cuthand,+Doug.+Askiwina:+A+Cree+World.+Regina,+Saskatchewan:+Coteau+Books.+2007.#v=onepage&amp;q=sweetgrass&amp;f=false|title=Askiwina: A Cree World|last=Cuthand|first=Doug|date=2007-04-03|publisher=Coteau Books|isbn=9781550505054|location=|pages=43|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JuflAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=wikaskokiseyin#v=onepage&amp;q=wikaskokiseyin&amp;f=false|title=Les Missions Catholiques|last=|first=|date=1877|publisher=Bureaux de la Propagation de la Foi|isbn=|location=|pages=81|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother believed that they had given too much to the government in the treaty. He attempted to take the Sweet Grass’ pistol and it accidentally discharged, resulting in his death.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Legacy ==

Sweet Grass through both policy and action would have a lasting impact on the Plains Cree. As a well respected Cree leader during a time of strife, Sweet Grass attempted to lead his people as best as he could. By 1870 chief Sweet Grass would begin to become more integrated into Canadian society. Due to missionaries moving into the interior, there was more significant pressure to convert to European religions, which many Cree did. Sweet Grass himself converted to Catholicism in 1870, following a general shift of Cree towards Christianity. With encroaching settlers and other indigenous groups, the dwindling of traditional hunting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plains Cree: Trade, Diplomacy, and, War, 1790-1870|last=Milloy|first=John|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-88755-141-3|location=Winnipeg|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disease rampant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Big Bear: End of Freedom|last=Hugh|first=Dempsey|publisher=University of Regina Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Regina|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweet Grass and his band of Cree were desperate for support. When Treaty 6 was put forward by the Canadian government in 1876, Sweetgrass was profoundly influential in bringing the Plains Cree into the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Big Bear: End of Freedom|last=Hugh|first=Dempsey|publisher=University of Regina Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Regina|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be Sweetgrass's last significant influence on his people, as he would die shortly after signing the Treaty. While the signing of the treaty can be seen as selling away indigenous rights, it did bring much-needed medication and food to the Cree who had insufficient options.

=== Treaty 6 Impacts ===

==== Short-term Effects ====
The impact of the signing of the treaty had a significant effect on Cree life for both those who signed the treaty and those who did not. Those who did began to move onto the reserve land and being affected by the agreements made in the treaty. Not all Plains Cree would sign the treaty at first, and many would become disillusioned after signing. Big Bear resisted signing of the treaty, hoping that he could hold out for a better deal with the Canadian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People: A Historical Guide to the First Nations of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba|last=Ward|first=Donald|publisher=Fifth House Publishing|year=1995|isbn=978-1-895618-56-3|location=Calgary|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian government could hold out for longer than any of the Cree groups who were slowly dying from starvation and disease. Even though Big Bear publicly and consistently spoke against sighing treaties, by 1882 starving, he would sign Treaty 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Big Bear: End of Freedom|last=Hugh|first=Dempsey|publisher=University of Regina|year=2006|isbn=|location=Regina|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signing the treaty, some of the Cree remained unsatisfied with the situation they had been forced into. Using this discontent, Chief Wandering Spirit gathered support and began to purses more aggressive policies towards settlers. When the Metis under Louis Riel started the Northwest-Rebellion in 1885, Wandering Spirit would lead a group of Cree to raid the Frog Lake Settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loyal Till Death: Indians and the North-West Rebellion|last=Stonechild|first=Blair|last2=Waiser|first2=Bill|publisher=Fifth House Books|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary goal of the raid was to get supplies, but it after some pushback from the settlers it quickly became violent. The group would then move to capture Fort Pit. The fort was heavily stocked with provisions, which angered the staving Cree. After the raid, they moved back to the reserve with the captured supplies without another incident. The perpetrators of the massacre would be apprehended and tried for murder and hung in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loyal Till Death: Indians and the Northwest-West Rebellion|last=Waiser|first=Bill|last2=Stonechild|first2=Blair|publisher=Fifth House Publishers|year=1997|isbn=978-1-895618-88-4|location=Calgary|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Debate of the Treaty====

The legacy of Treaty 6 continues to affect the Cree till the modern day. Issues arise from the mixed interpretations of the Treaty by both the Indigenous groups and the Government. As this agreement is the first legal agreement between these Indigenous groups and the new Canadian government, which continued to impact and facilitate interactions between them. This has led to conflict over the clauses of the agreement. The disagreement on Treaty 6 stems from three major issues; language barriers, verbal agreements made during the negotiation, and the rights for chiefs to sign the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/treaty-6/|title=Treaty 6|last=Filice|first=Michelle|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cree cultural the chiefs do not always hold the legal right to make choices for the entire band. As the treaty process never included women in the discussion it ignored an important cultural pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venne|first=Sharon|date=1997|title=Understanding Treaty 6: An Indigenous Perspective|url=|journal=Aboriginal and Treaty Rights in Canada|volume=|pages=191|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Cree who participated in the treaty were unable to understand legal English. While there was a Cree verbal translation, the Treaty was made in English. The next biggest problem comes from a lack of follow through on verbal agreements. To the Canadian delegation, the only legally binding contracts were what was written into the treaty. In Cree culture, verbal agreements hold the same amount weight as any other agreements.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venne|first=Sharon|date=1997|title=Understanding Treaty 6: An Indigenous Perspective|url=|journal=Aboriginal and Treaty Rights in Canada|volume=|pages=192–193|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who signed Treaty Six argue that understanding the treaty can only be understood when put into a context of the discussions that occurred during the treaty-making process. The meaning of land and the surrender of it was not entirely understood by those who were signing the agreement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There was limited understanding on the level of Canadian settlement that was going to happen, and limited knowledge on how indigenous people would be restricted from the land.

=== Sweet Grass's Band ===
When Sweet Grass died in 1877 his son was left to hold together the Band who followed his father. Under the leadership of Young Sweet Grass, the band began to fall apart due to internal conflict. At this point, Young Sweet Grass would lead a fragment of the band to join with other Cree, who had signed Treaty 6.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.batc.ca/sweetgrass/|title=Sweetgrass First Nation|website=www.batc.ca|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young Sweet Grass would eventually become chief and would name the new group the Sweetgrass First Nation in honour of his father. The Sweetgrass Nation was settled into the land West of the township Battleford, Saskatchewan in 1884. From here the group made income from farming and lumber sale, supplemented with traditional methods as much as possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the years after settlement, the Sweetgrass reserve would continue to be affected by famine and disease. Many people would leave the reserve due to government policies to limit food rations. This would lead high mortality rates within the community. On the Sweetgrass reserve, the mortality rates would grow after 1885 to 185 per every 1000 people on the reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvations, and the loss of Aboriginal Life|last=Daschuk|first=James|publisher=University of Regina|year=2013|isbn=|location=Regina|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tactic of withholding food from reserves will be used by the Canadian government to force cooperation. After resisting sending children into the Canadian school system, the Cree living on the reserve received no food rations, until they capitulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Staving, and the Loss of Aboriginal Life|last=Daschuk|first=James|publisher=University of Regina Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-88977-340-0|location=Regina|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the Sweetgrass nation had over 1500 registered members who primarily live outside of the Sweetgrass Reserve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Early life and family==
Rasmussen was born Sólrun Jákupsdóttir on 22 November 1968 in [[Tórshavn]], [[Faroe Islands]]. She is the daughter of chief physician Jákup Petersen and lecturer Bergljót av Skarði. Her mother's parents were the [[Tjóðveldi]] politician [[Sigurð Joensen]] and the writer [[Sigrið av Skarði]], who was the daughter of the Faroese folk educationist and poet [[Símun av Skarði]]. 

Rasmussen moved from the Faroe Islands to Denmark to study medicine.&lt;ref name="TV2"&gt;*{{cite news|url=http://vip.tv2.dk/article.php/id-21548060.html|title=Sådan er Danmarks nye førstedame|date=April 6, 2009|publisher=''[[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]]'' |accessdate=2009-04-08|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After her marriage to Lars Løkke Rasmussen and the birth of their children, Rasmussen ended her pre-medical training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/319759:Nyheder-til-usikre-laesere--Solrun---Danmarks-nye-foerstedame "Sólrun - Danmarks nye førstedame"], ''Kristeligt Dagblad'', April 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Rasmussen and her husband have 3 children.&lt;ref name="TV2"/&gt;

==Career==
From 1998 to 2005, Rasmussen was a city council member for [[Græsted-Gilleleje]], representing the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] Party .&lt;ref name="TV2"/&gt; Beginning in 2001, Rasmussen studied education at Zahles Seminarian, earning a Teaching Certification in 2005.&lt;ref name="TV2"/&gt; Since 2005, Rasmussen has taught English, mathematics, physics and natural science  at the [[Royal Danish Theatre]]'s Laeseskolen in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name="TV2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Danielsen , Rikke, |url=http://www.sondagsavisen.dk/207/01075090/|title=Interview: Hunden får mere opmærksomhed end Lars |date=April 10, 2009 | publisher=sondagsavisen a/s |accessdate=2009-04-10|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her husband assumed the position of Prime Minister on April 5, 2009.&lt;ref name="TV2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlingske Media"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bt.dk/politik/loekkes-kones-store-frygt-lars-loekke-som-statsminister |title=Løkkes kones store frygt: Lars Løkke som statsminister|work=''[[B.T.

Rasmussen was sometimes described as "Førstedame" ([[First Lady]]), rather than Statsministerfrue (Wife of the Prime Minister), although [[Queen Margrethe II]] as head of state was considered Denmark's official first lady.&lt;ref&gt;Thomsen, Per Bang, [http://jp.dk/indland/indland_politik/article1654781.ece ''"Førstedame.

(Berlinske Tidende), April 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;      

In 2009, Rasmussen returned to politics and was elected to a council seat in [[Gribskov municipality]] for the Venstre Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://borsen.dk/politik/nyhed/164382/ "Sólrun Løkke tilbage i kommunalpolitik"], ''[[Dagbladet Børsen]]'', 26 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frank Møller, [http://www.seoghoer.dk/Nyheder/Kendte%20DK/Arkiv/2009/11/solrun%20loekke%20rasmussen%20valgt.aspx "Sólrun Løkke Rasmussen: Mindre tid til børnene "], ''[[Se og Hør (Denmark)|Se og Hør]]'', 18 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, she visited [[Liberia]] where she met with Liberian President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] as representative for the [[Danish Refugee Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/342146:Udland--Statsministerfruen-besoeger-Liberia "Statsministerfruen besøger Liberia], ''[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]'', 14 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Nolan has been one of the leaders of the Republican Party in [[Kentucky]]. In 2016 he was the [[Campbell County, Kentucky]] chairman of [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]], after receiving the personal support of Donald Trump early in 2016.&lt;ref name="Arizmendi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; As a member of the Republican Party identified with the [[Tea Party movement]], and later as a supporter of Donald Trump, Nolan has often criticized the Republican leadership in Kentucky.&lt;ref name="cincinnati" /&gt; ''River City News'' publisher Michael Monks described Nolan as an "outspoken and controversial" political figure in Kentucky.&lt;ref name="rs2"&gt;[http://www.rawstory.com/2017/04/gop-school-board-member-indicted-on-sex-trafficking-charges/ Former Trump Kentucky campaign chair charged with human sex trafficking of a minor], Rawstory.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Nolan unsuccessfully tried to remove and replace Senator and Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] as a delegate to the [[2016 Republican National Convention]] due to McConnell's lack of support for Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsh6.com/news/nation-now/trump-allies-sidelined-in-kentucky-delegate-battle/151418435|title=Trump allies sidelined in Kentucky delegate battle|first=|last=TEGNA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arizmendi"&gt;Jordan Arizmendi, [http://politicalhaze.com/2017/04/rise-fall-kentucky-trump-campaign-manager/ The Rise and Fall of a Kentucky Trump Campaign Manager], Political Haze, 25 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rs2" /&gt; On May 17, 2016 Nolan was appointed by Governor [[Matt Bevin]] as one of the four members of the first Kentucky Boxing and Wrestling Commission for a term expiring in May 2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluegrassmma.com/2016/05/governor-creates-new-kentucky-boxing-wrestling-commission/|title=Governor creates new Kentucky Boxing and Wrestling Commission|date=May 17, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was removed from office days later due to controversy over a social media post.&lt;ref name="rs2" /&gt;

In August 2016, Nolan filed to run for a seat on the Campbell County School Board.&lt;ref name="Mayhew"&gt;{{cite url|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/campbellcounty/2016/08/09/campbell-candidates-file-forelectedoffices/88487116/|title=School board tops Campbell County election filings|first=Chris|last=Mayhew|publisher=Cincinnati.com|date=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran on a platform of "eliminating property tax revenue for schools gradually" and finding other ways to fund education, such as selling [[naming rights]] to schools, and advocated state-supported [[school vouchers]] and raising teacher salaries.&lt;ref name="Mayhew"/&gt; Nolan won election to the school board in November 2016, defeating incumbent Rich Mason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/boone-county/2016/11/07/live-reports-northern-kentucky-election-day/93426296/|title=Campbell County Schools Board of Education District 5 challenger Timothy Nolan unseated incumbent Rich Mason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan was noted as continuing to serve on the school board when being "charged with human trafficking" on May 2, 2017,&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite url|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trafficking-lawsuit-idUSKBN17Y299|title=Ex-Trump campaign official charged with human trafficking|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but resigned from the position on May 4 after being "indicted on nine felony and two misdemeanor counts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox19.com/story/35345653/former-campbell-county-judge-indicted-by-ky-attorney-general|title=Former Campbell County judge indicted on rape, human trafficking charges|publisher=FOX19 Digital Media|date=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Twelve Apostles of Ireland''' (also known as '''Twelve Apostles of Erin''', [[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Dhá Aspal Déag na hÉireann'') were twelve early [[Celtic Christianity|Irish monastic]] [[saint]]s of the sixth century who studied under [[Finnian of Clonard|St Finian]] (d. 549) at his famous monastic school [[Clonard Abbey]] at Cluain-Eraird (Eraird's Meadow), now Clonard in [[County Meath]].&lt;ref name ="Flood"&gt;
{{Cite journal | last = Gratton-Flood | first = W.H. | title = The Twelve Apostles of Erin | work = The Catholic Encyclopedia | volume = I | location = New York | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | date = 1 March 1907  | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01632a.htm | accessdate = 9 February 2008 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
[[Clonard Abbey]], situated on the [[River Boyne]] in modern [[County Meath]] was one of the main monastic schools in [[early Christian Ireland]]. During the 6th century, some of the most significant names in the history of Irish Christianity studied at the Clonard monastery. It is said that the average number of scholars under instruction at Clonard was 3,000. Twelve students who studied under [[Finnian of Clonard|St. Finian]] became known as the "Twelve Apostles of Ireland".&lt;ref name="Flood"/&gt;

This tradition is recorded in the 17th century, possibly{{clarify|date=May 2017}} based on older sources.
The twelve saints are grouped together as such in the text ''Dá apstol décc na hÉrenn'' ("The Twelve Apostles of Ireland", the modern Irish being ''Dhá Aspal Déag na hÉireann''). The text is preserved in a manuscript belonging to [[Michael O'Clery]] (Brussels, Bibliothèque Royale MS 2324–2340), dated 1629.&lt;ref&gt;Van den Gheyn, Joseph, ''Catalogue des manuscrits de la Bibliothèque Royale de Belgique''  vol. 5: ''Histoire — hagiographie, Brussels'', Lambertin (1905), [https://archive.org/stream/cataloguedesmanu05brusuoft#page/384/mode/2up 384–389].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the narrative, the twelve apostles of Ireland are gathered together for a feast in the house of St Finian, a magical flower appears in their midst. It is decided that a voyage to the flower's homeland is to be undertaken by one of them, the choice of person then being determined by casting lots. When, however, the lot falls on the old Brendan of Birr, his younger namesake Brendan moccu Altae goes in his stead. Brendan sets out with many companions and undergoes many adventures, much as related in Brendan's ''Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Mathúna, "The ''Irish Life of Saint Brendan''", pp. 147–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Twelve Apostles ==
# [[Ciarán of Saighir|Saint Ciarán of Saighir]] ([[Saighir|Seir-Kieran]]). In the [[Martyrology of Oengus]], saint Ciarán of Saighir is not listed as one of the twelve apostles of Ireland, and instead is replaced by Finnian of Clonard himself.&lt;ref&gt;p. 168-9. https://archive.org/stream/martyrologyofoen29oenguoft#page/168/mode/2up/search/twelve&lt;/ref&gt; The numbering of Finnian as one of the Twelve, and not Ciarán of Saighir appears to be the older tradition, by which Ciarán was attached to pair with Ciarán of Clon.
# [[Ciarán of Clonmacnoise|Saint Ciarán of Clonmacnoise]], on the Shannon, in the barony of Garrycastle, [[County Offaly]], died in the year 549.
# [[Brendan of Birr|Saint Brendan of Birr]], now [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]], County Offaly. He died on 29 November 571.

A '''union organizer''' (or '''union organiser''') is a specific type of [[trade union]] member (often elected) or an appointed union official. A majority of unions appoint rather than elect their organisers. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In some unions, the organiser's role is to recruit groups of workers under the [[organizing model]]. In other unions, the organiser's role is largely that of servicing members and enforcing work rules, similar to the role of a [[Union steward|shop steward]]. In some unions, organisers may also take on industrial/legal roles such as making representations before [[Fair Work Australia]], tribunals, or [[court]]s.

In [[North America]], a union organiser is a union representative who "organizes" or unionizes non-union [[companies]] or worksites. Organisers primarily exist to assist non-union workers in forming chapters of locals, usually by leading them in their efforts.

==Methodology==
Organisers employ various methods to secure recognition by the employer as being a legitimate union, the  ultimate goal being a [[collective bargaining agreement]]. The methods can be classified as being either top-down organizing or bottom-up organizing.&lt;ref&gt;Breslin, ''Organize or Die,'' 2003, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Top-down organizing focuses on persuading [[management]] through salesmanship or pressure tactics.  The salesmanship may include offering access to resources such as to a well-trained and skilled supply of labor or access to union [[cartels]].  Pressure tactics may include [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] with the intention of embarrassing management or disrupting business, as well as assisting the government in investigating [[employment law]] and [[labor law]] violations.&lt;ref&gt;DeFreitas, "Can Construction Unions Organize New Immigrants?", ''Regional Labor Review,'' Fall 2006, p. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  A strict enforcement of these laws might result in fines and might serve to hurt the violator's chances in a competitive [[bidding]] process. Top-down organizing is generally considered easier than bottom-up and is practiced more in the [[construction]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;Breslin, ''Organize or Die,'' 2003, p. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottom-up organizing focuses on the workers and usually involves a certification process, normally overseen by a labor relations board such as the [[National Labor Relations Board|NLRB]] in the U.S.  The process entails either a secret ballot election or, in some cases, a card-signing effort (called card check). In either case, should a majority of the employees agree to union representation, the results bind the company to recognize and negotiate with the union. Normally, both sides are given a chance to campaign for or against unionization, though management has a decided advantage due to their greater access to the employees, as well as management's inherent ability to discipline or terminate employees.  It is in this electioneering model where the organiser really organizes: arranging meetings, devising strategy, and developing an internal structure known as an organizing [[committee]]. It is from the pool of [[activist]]s recruited to the organizing committee that the union typically later draws its shop stewards.  Though some mistake organizing as strictly being a recruitment effort, numerous obstacles emerge which require more than simple enlistment and promotion of the union.  During organizing, management has greater means to reward or punish workers, far overshadowing methods available to the union.&lt;ref name="OrganizingGuide"&gt;Diamond and Sneiderman, ''Organizing Guide for Local Unions,'' 1992, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="No4"&gt;La Botz, ''A Troublemaker's Handbook,'' 1991, p. 8; Kelber, ''My 70 Years in the Labor Movement,'' 2006, p. 29-30; Murolo and Chitty, ''From The Folks Who Brought You The Weekend,'' 2001, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, in most countries, laws such as the U.S. [[National Labor Relations Act]], guarantee the rights of workers to seek union membership and forbid management's use of undue influence such as bribes or threats.  Nonetheless, such charges are hard to prove and the labor movement believes the entire process to be slanted against them in enforcement and interpretation of labor laws.&lt;ref name="OrganizingGuide" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bai, "The New Boss," January 30, 2005, p. 40; DeFreitas, "Anxious Anniversary: Is Recession Stalking the 5-Year-Old Recovery?", 2006, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, organizing involves legal wrangling over issues such as voter eligibility. In such cases, issues are often settled by appeal to the Labor Board who serves, essentially, as a referee during the process. Intrigue during heated campaigns is not uncommon. In various cases, one or both sides have used spying and information-gathering techniques tantamount to [[industrial espionage]].

==Personality==
Organizers must be determined, [[charisma]]tic, and persuasive individuals able to sway groups to action under trying circumstances when jobs are on the line.&lt;ref&gt;Breslin, ''Organize or Die,'' 2003, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizers must be strong enough to stand up to constant confrontation and must be willing to take big risks. Since failure rates of organizing campaigns are high, "burn-out" among organizers is prevalent. Organizers frequently work under the constraints of limited resources (see sections on organizing as cause and controversies).&lt;ref&gt;Bai, "The New Boss," January 30, 2005, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Botz, ''A Troublemaker's Handbook,'' 1991, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause within a cause==
Within the labor movement, organizing is the cause within the cause.  In most industrialized nations, there has been a steady decline in union membership and in the influence of organized labor since the 1950s.  A response to this decline has been a renewed organizing effort. The heads of unions are well aware of the problem. In the U.S., many labor activists have blamed [[John Sweeney (labor leader)|John Sweeney]], the former (1995–2009) President of the [[AFL-CIO]], for not doing enough to organize.&lt;ref&gt;Kelber, ''My 70 Years in the Labor Movement,'' 2006, p. 343, 359-360; Bai, "The New Boss," January 30, 2005, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, this has been cited{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} as the genesis of the split within the American labor movement that led to the formation of the [[Change to Win Federation]] (a rival [[umbrella organization]] of [[North America]]n unions set up as an alternative to the AFL-CIO in 2005), by Change to Win advocates at least. Many unions see organizing as a way to ensure the future of their organization.  Unions who emphasize organizing and are [[expansionist]] are said to have the "organizing model." By contrast, other unions are said to have the "[[service model|servicing model]]," spending most of their resources on providing services to the existing membership (i.e., non-expansionist).

==Controversies==
Within the labor movement, there is some resistance to organizing, though more in deed than in word. Organizing can be seen as a drain on scarce resources with insignificant returns and with results tenuous.&lt;ref&gt;Kelber, ''My 70 Years in the Labor Movement,'' 2006, p. 362; Breslin, ''Organize or Die,'' 2003, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Most unions in the U.S. adopt a service model and eschew organizing. In [[Transient (civil engineering)|transient]] industries such as construction, an increase in the supply of labor from newly organized shops may cause the supply of jobs to dwindle below what an increased membership can absorb.&lt;ref&gt;Fitch, ''Solidarity for Sale,'' 2006, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Most disputes between unions are [[jurisdiction]]al (territorial).  Union jurisdiction is based on [[geographic]] scope, [[craft]], [[industry]], historical claim, and compromise. Unions have overlapping jurisdictions.  Critics within the labor movement have blamed the movement itself for the fractious effects of union-on-union [[competition]] and perceived issues of raiding. Expansionism and the scramble for members in organizing programs bring to light these border issues.

Opponents of organizing, mainly in [[management]] and business, argue that unionization divides employees against their employer and results in increased costs. Such accusations are not entirely without foundation: Indeed, a successful organizing campaign usually demonstrably benefits the labor at the expense of management. Critics will often circulate horror stories about plant closures and retaliatory firings to discourage union activity and uptake among the workers. Real or imagined, such horror stories are taken as warnings and have a chilling effect on voting.  Though illegal,&lt;ref&gt;Office of General Counsel, ''A Guide To Basic Law and Procedure Under the National Labor Relations Act,'' 1997, p. 19, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; retaliatory terminations remain a problem for organisers to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, ''Labor Law Handbook for Organizing Unions Under the National Labor Relations Act,'' 1991, p. 20; Kelber, ''My 70 Years in the Labor Movement,'' 2006, p. 29-30; Rundle, "Starbucks Union Battle Goes Before Labor Board," ''Metro New York,'' July 10, 2007, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Fear is the leading obstacle to organizing.&lt;ref&gt;La Botz, ''A Troublemaker's Handbook,'' 1991, p. 178; DeFreitas, "Can Construction Unions Organize New Immigrants?", ''Regional Labor Review,'' Fall 2006, p. 28; Murolo and Chitty, ''From The Folks Who Brought You The Weekend,'' 2001, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter organizing==
In bottom-up organizing, management and labor are pitted against each other and management often schedules retaliatory, aggressive tactics in an effort to break the chapter, called "[[union-busting]]."  The intention of such union-busting may be to "nip it in the bud" before getting locked into a costly collective bargaining agreement. Management may feel that the organizing campaign encourages and capitalizes upon worker disobedience and perceived disloyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Kelber, ''My 70 Years in the Labor Movement,'' 2006, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, management may hire anti-union consultants or [[lawyers]] known as "union-busters" or "union avoidance consultants." With the goal of thwarting organizing, union-busters typically have a two-pronged approach: firstly, management will cut deals with individual workers to betray the union and secondly, to exploit loopholes in labor law in an effort to derail or sandbag the election process. The emergence of union-busting as an industry is a relatively new phenomenon and is described in Martin Levitt's book ''Confessions of A Union Buster.''&lt;ref&gt;*Levitt and Toczynski, ''Confessions of A Union Buster,'' 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the emergence of the union-avoidance industry, practitioners were mainly "[[goon squad]]s" also used for strike-breaking.&lt;ref&gt;Kelber, ''My 70 Years in the Labor Movement,'' 2006, p. 24; Diamond and Sneiderman, ''Organizing Guide for Local Unions,'' 1992, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the largest and most well-known "goon squad" for hire was the [[Pinkerton Detective Agency]],&lt;ref&gt;Murolo and Chitty, ''From The Folks Who Brought You The Weekend,'' 2001, p. 105, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; still active today, though in a different capacity. William W. Delaney's "My Father Was Killed By Pinkerton Men" is a song about the violence that often surrounded early American labor strife.

==Organizing in popular culture==
The most famous movie about organizing is the 1979 factually-based film ''[[Norma Rae]]'', the story of a [[Jewish]] organiser from [[New York City]] who came to the American [[South]] to organize a [[textile]] [[Cotton mill|mill]]. He recruits Norma Rae, played by [[Sally Field]]. Norma becomes a key union [[activist]] who defies management at great personal risk.

The 1987 production of ''[[Matewan]]'' is another factually-based story of an organiser who visits a small mining town in [[West Virginia]] and who is able to unite rival [[ethnic]] groups against a common enemy: the company.

Both of these stories feature outsiders entering [[rural]] [[company towns]] and stirring workers up against exploitative management.  This is a common theme in organizing.  The workers are cast as simple [[commoners]] being [[oppression|oppressed]] by powerful managers cast in the role of [[villain]]s.  The organiser is portrayed as a liberator. There is some truth in these stories since companies did, in fact, historically hire armed thugs to break up organizing drives through unethical and oppressive means.&lt;ref name="No4" /&gt;  Modern unions work within the existing system, rather than against it, through sophisticated [[political]] action programs. Most unions have reinvented themselves as streamlined, professional machines.&lt;ref&gt;Bai, "The New Boss," ''New York Times Magazine,'' January 30, 2005, p. 41, 42; Breslin, ''Organize or Die,'' 2003, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

''10,000 Black Men Named George'', released in 2002, is a movie based on the true story of [[A. Philip Randolph]], the famous [[black]] organiser who organized the railroad company's largely black [[Pullman Porters]].

The film ''[[Bread and Roses (2000 film)|Bread and Roses]]'' (2001) depicts the [[Service Employees International Union]]'s "[[Justice for Janitors]]" campaign to organize cleaners.  The story is also a love story between an [[idealistic]] young organiser and a female Hispanic [[immigrant]] among those he is organizing.

Both of these stories incorporate pro-union messages with ethnic determination.  In the case of the Pullman Porters, Randolph is remembered as a [[civil rights]] [[hero]]. The Justice for Janitors campaign is about immigrants' rights, as many of the organized janitors are from [[Spanish speaking]] or [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] countries.  The status of the characters as [[minorities]] paints a picture of them as being outside of, or on the margins of, the [[American Dream]], thus further casting workers and activists as underdogs.  The underdog theme is an inspirational [[archetype]] in [[myth]].

In the 2005 action movie ''[[Four Brothers (film)|Four Brothers]]'', one of the characters is a former union activist who turns the bad guy's henchmen against him by informally organizing them against their boss based on the common organizing themes of a greater share in the [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] and respect on the job.

In the 1997 action movie ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'', [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s villainous character pursues fellow [[Assassination|assassin]] [[John Cusack]] in order to include him in a ridiculous assassins' union.

These latter two movies use organizing as a plot device, though they involve [[black market]] businesses and are far-fetched for this reason.  Nonetheless, they demonstrate how, absent a union's presence, the same issues arise in any [[vocation]]. Also, both of the movies take place in the [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] area, a city which has produced some great organisers.

The 1992 production ''[[Hoffa]]'', starring Jack Nicholson as famed labor leader [[Jimmy Hoffa]] of the [[Teamsters]], begins the story where Hoffa's career began: organizing truck drivers and warehouse workers in and around Detroit.  Jimmy Hoffa went on to become one of the most powerful labor leaders in U.S. history.

The 1978 movie ''[[F.I.S.T]]'', tells the same story of Hoffa's beginnings as an organiser and of his rise to power, albeit with more liberties taken.  [[Sylvester Stallone]] plays Hoffa as a man with good intentions, dogged on both sides, by both sides of the law.

Both Hoffa stories feature Hoffa as a tough "man of the people" and chronicle how his organizing swelled the ranks of the Teamsters.  Hoffa was notorious for taking an "ends justifies the means" approach to organizing.  Hoffa's legacy remains: his son, [[James P. Hoffa]], is the current General President of the Teamsters.

In an episode of the popular American [[sit-com]]  ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', the characters hold an organizing meeting which ends with a manager threatening to fire everyone involved.  The character played by [[comedian]] [[Patrice O'Neal]] tells the boss, "This isn't over."

The [[Fred Savage]] sitcom ''Working'' had an episode where the main character organizes his fellow workers into a union and tells management it’s because he really cares about the well-being of his coworkers, exhibiting solidarity.

The song "[[Solidarity Forever]]" by [[Ralph Chaplin]] has become the anthem of large parts of the labor movement such as those in North America.

'''Valente Quintero''' (1887 &amp;ndash; March 19, 1922) was a Mexican [[sub-lieutenant]] who is remembered today for his duel against Martín Elenes on March 19, 1922. The event resulted in the death of both men, and was popularized in both [[corrido]] and [[film]].

He participated in the maderistas forces until his triumph in [[Sinaloa]]. He was born in 1887, in the hamlet of Bamopa, in the [[Badiraguato Municipality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sinagawa Montoya|first=Herberto|title=Las 'Tranvías' de Antaño|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/eloccidental/notas/n1349408.htm|publisher=El Occidental|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valente's widow, Martina Ortiz de Quintero, was interviewed by Francisco Gil Leyva about the events that took place on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Si el mayor me las paga con plata, yo me las pago con oro|url=http://ssh.org.mx/sitio/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Musica.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827202054/http://ssh.org.mx/sitio/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Musica.pdf|archive-date=27 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Valente Quintero's life was dramatized in [[music]] and [[film]]. Songwriter Rosendo Monzón wrote the lyrics of Quintero's last moments and his death, and [[Antonio Aguilar]] portrayed him in the film ''[[Valente Quintero (film)|Valente Quintero]]'', which he produced and co-wrote. Singer-actress [[Lucha Villa]] has also sung the corrido of Valente Quintero.

Vangelis began his career working with several popular bands of the 1960s such as the Forminx and [[Aphrodite's Child]], with the latter's album ''[[666 (Aphrodite's Child album)|666]]'' going on to be recognized as a [[progressive rock|progressive]]-[[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] rock classic.&lt;ref name="Hischak" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=ac-666 |title=Prog Reviews review of 666 |accessdate=4 November 2008 |publisher=Ground &amp; Sky |date=5 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124182400/http://progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=ac-666 |archive-date=24 January 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1970s, Vangelis composed [[music scores]] for several animal documentaries, including ''{{lang|fr|[[L'Apocalypse des animaux (album)|L'Apocalypse des Animaux]]}}'', ''{{lang|fr|[[La Fête sauvage]]}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|[[Opéra sauvage]]}}''; the success of these scores brought him into the film scoring mainstream. In the early 1980s, Vangelis formed a musical partnership with [[Jon Anderson]], the lead singer of progressive rock band [[Yes (band)|Yes]], and the duo went on to release several albums together as [[Jon &amp; Vangelis]].

In 1981, he composed the score for the Oscar-winning film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', for which he won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. [[Chariots of Fire (album)|The soundtrack's]] single, the film's "[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Titles]]" theme, also reached the top of the American [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and was used as the background music at the [[London 2012 Olympics]] winners' medal presentation ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Hischak" /&gt; Vangelis also received acclaim for his synthesizer-based soundtrack for the 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]''.

Having had a career in music spanning over 50 years and having composed and performed more than 50 albums, Vangelis is considered to be one of the most important figures in the history of [[electronic music]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph UK"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3634447/My-Greek-odyssey-with-Alexander.html |title=My Greek odyssey with Alexander |author=Peter Culshaw |date=6 January 2005 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p112251|pure_url=yes}} |title= Vangelis Biography |author=Jason Ankeny |accessdate=6 November 2008 |publisher=All Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Journey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2013/12/04/vangelis-and-the-journey-to-ithaka-documentary-now-available/ |title=Vangelis And The Journey to Ithaka Documentary Now Available |date=4 December 2013 |publisher=Synthtopia |accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Formative years===
Vangelis was born 29 March 1943, in [[Agria]], near [[Volos]], Greece. Largely a self-taught musician, he reportedly began composing at the age of three.&lt;ref name="Hischak" /&gt; His earliest memories include playing piano, percussion, and music of his own device.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/vangelis/interviews/emm/emm.htm |title=Soil Festivities Vangelis Speaks |author=Dan Goldstein |date=November 1984 |magazine=Electronics &amp; Music Maker |accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career, Vangelis has not had substantial knowledge of reading or writing musical notation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} &lt;!--When he was six, his parents enrolled him at a specialist music school in [[Athens]],&lt;ref name="Hischak" /&gt; --&gt;He rebuffed his parents' attempts to supplement his experimentation with formal training.&lt;ref name="Doerschuk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/vangelis/interviews/keyboard/keyboard.htm |accessdate=2017-12-25 |title=Oscar-winning Synthesist, Interview by Bob Doerschuk |last1=Doerschuk |first1=Bob |date= |work=Nemo Studios |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222053308/http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/vangelis/interviews/keyboard/keyboard.htm |archivedate=2017-12-22 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vangelis has called himself fortunate to not attend music school, which he considers a creative impediment.&lt;ref name="Telegraph UK"/&gt; He studied painting, an art he still practices, at the [[Athens School of Fine Arts]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Vangelis said in an interview with ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', when asked about his lack of ability to read music: {{quote|When the teachers asked me to play something, I would pretend that I was reading it and play from memory. I didn't fool them, but I didn't care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vangelis - The Composer Who Set Chariots Afire|journal=Life|date=July 1982|volume=5|issue=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=kOQxAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Work in Aphrodite's Child and other bands===
When Vangelis was twelve years old he became interested in [[jazz]] music, and with the social movement to [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref name="Bigot1984"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elsew.com/data/gec84.htm |title=Vangelis analyses his syntheses |author=Yves Bigot |date=January 1984 |magazine=Guitare &amp; Claviers |issue=37 |accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At fifteen, he started to form school bands, not to cover other musicians but to have fun.&lt;ref name="Lake1974"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.elsew.com/data/mema74.htm |title=Greek Group: Vangelis Papathanassiou is one of those rare rock characters - an eccentric. Will this ex-keyboard player of Aphrodite's Child join Yes? Steve Lake meets the man himself |author=Steve Lake |date=10 August 1974 |magazine=Melody Maker |accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s Vangelis was one of the founders of pop rock group The Forminx (or the Formynx), which became popular in Greece.&lt;ref name="theforminx"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangelismovements.com/theforminx.htm |title=The Forminx |publisher=Vangelis Movements |accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in Athens, the five-piece band played a mixture of [[cover (music)|cover versions]] and their own material, the latter written mostly by Vangelis with lyrics by DJ and record producer Nico Mastorakis, and sung in English. The Forminx released nine singles and a Christmas EP before disbanding in 1966 at the peak of their success.&lt;ref name="theforminx"/&gt; A film being made about them at the time, directed by Theo Angelopoulos, was never completed and the songs composed for the movie were never released. Vangelis spent the next two years mostly studio-bound, writing and producing for other Greek artists.&lt;ref name="Blue Point"&gt;[http://www.bluepoint.gen.tr/vangelis/more_eng.html Blue Point] Retrieved 11 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of the [[1968 student riots|student riots in 1968]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph UK"/&gt; Vangelis founded the [[progressive rock]] band [[Aphrodite's Child]] together with [[Demis Roussos]], [[Loukas Sideras]], and [[Silver Koulouris|Anargyros "Silver" Koulouris]]. After an unsuccessful attempt to enter the UK, they found a home in Paris where they recorded their first single, a hit across much of Europe called "[[Rain and Tears]]". Other singles followed, along with two albums, which, in total, sold over 20 million copies. The record sales led the record company to request a third album, and Vangelis went on to conceive the double-album ''[[666 (Aphrodite's Child album)|666]]'', based on [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], the last book in the Bible. It is sometimes considered one of the best progressive rock albums.&lt;ref name="Telegraph UK"/&gt; [[Irene Papas]] provided the vocals for the track "Infinity". Tensions between members during the recording of ''666'' eventually caused the split of the band in 1971, prior to the album's release the following year. Despite the split, Vangelis subsequently produced several albums and singles for Demis Roussos, who, in turn, contributed vocals to the [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|''Blade Runner'' soundtrack]].&lt;ref name="Blue Point"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=1171 Prog Archives bio of AC] Retrieved 21 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsewhere Oor"&gt;[http://elsew.com/data/oor76.htm Elsewhere Oor] Retrieved 12 October&lt;/ref&gt; He often recalls that the music industry "was under the impression that in order to be alive and to be able to create what I had in mind I had to become successful. I realised that success and pure creativity are not very compatible... Instead of being able to move forward freely and do what you really wish, you find yourself stuck and obliged to repeat yourself and your previous success".&lt;ref name="TheGuardian2012"/&gt;

===Early solo works===
While still in Aphrodite's Child, Vangelis had already been involved in other projects. In the 1960s he scored music for three Greek films; ''My Brother, the Traffic Policeman'' (1963) directed by Filippos Fylaktos, ''5,000 Lies'' (1966) by [[Giorgos Konstantinou]] and ''[[Vortex (film)|To Prosopo tis Medousas]]'' (1967) by [[Nikos Koundouros]]. In 1970 he composed the score for ''Sex-Power'' directed by [[Henry Chapier]], followed by ''Salut, Jerusalem'' in 1972 and ''Amore'' in 1974.&lt;ref name="Hischak" /&gt;

In 1971, some [[jam sessions]] with a group of musicians in London resulted in two albums' worth of material, unofficially released without Vangelis' permission in 1978, titled ''[[Hypothesis (album)|Hypothesis]]'' and ''[[The Dragon (Vangelis album)|The Dragon]]''. Vangelis succeeded in taking legal action to have them withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Spin"/&gt; A more successful project was his scoring of wildlife documentary films in the early 1970s made by French [[film director|filmmaker]] [[Frédéric Rossif]]. The first soundtrack, [[L'Apocalypse des animaux (album)|''L'Apocalypse des animaux'']], was released in 1973.&lt;ref name="Nemo1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v01.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 1 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the [[May 1968 events in France|student riots of 1968]] provided the inspiration for an album titled ''[[Fais que ton rêve soit plus long que la nuit]]'' (Make Your Dream Last Longer Than the Night), comprising musical passages mixed with news snippets and [[protest songs]]; some lyrics were based on graffiti daubed on walls during the riots.&lt;ref name="Nemo1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vangelismovements.com/faisquetonrevesoitpluslongquelanuit.htm Album review] Retrieved 20 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided music for the 1973 [[Henry Chapier]] film ''Amore''.

In 1973 Vangelis' solo career began in earnest. His second solo album was ''[[Earth (Vangelis album)|Earth]]''. It was a percussive-orientated album with Byzantine undertones.&lt;ref name="Nemo1"/&gt; It featured a group of musicians including ex-Aphrodite's Child guitarist [[Silver Koulouris]] and also vocalist and songwriter [[Robert Fitoussi]] (better known as [[F.R. David]] of "[[Words (F. R. David song)|Words]]" fame).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groove.nl/cd/2/20955.html Groove NL reviews] Retrieved 2 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This line-up, later briefly performing under the name "Odyssey", released a single in 1974 titled "Who", but that was Vangelis' last involvement with them. Later in 1974, Vangelis was widely tipped to join another prog-rock band, [[Yes (band)|Yes]], following the departure of [[Rick Wakeman]]. After a couple of weeks of rehearsals Vangelis wavered on the option of joining Yes,&lt;ref name="Spin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=_yMEAAAAMBAJ |title=New On The Charts - Jon and Vangelis |date=30 August 1980 |journal=Billboard |volume=92 |issue=35 |page=31 |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the band hired Swiss keyboard player [[Patrick Moraz]] instead. Vangelis did, however, become friends with Yes' lead vocalist [[Jon Anderson]] and later worked with him on several occasions, including as the duo [[Jon &amp; Vangelis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bondegezou.co.uk/amy_faq.htm Alt.music FAQ Yes] Retrieved 2 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solo career breakthrough===
After moving to London in 1975, Vangelis signed with [[RCA Records]], set up his own studio, [[Nemo Studios]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/ Nemo Studios] Retrieved 7 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and began recording a string of electronic albums.&lt;ref name="Hischak" /&gt; The first of these, ''[[Heaven and Hell (1975 album)|Heaven and Hell]]'', was released in 1975 and was premiered at [[The Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref name="Nemo2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v02.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 2 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by  ''[[Albedo 0.39]]'' (1976), ''[[Spiral (Vangelis album)|Spiral]]'' (1977), ''[[Beaubourg (album)|Beaubourg]]'' (1978) and ''[[China (Vangelis album)|China]]'' (1979).  Each of the albums had particular thematic inspiration; ''[[Heaven]] and [[Hell]]'' the homonymous mythological places, ''Albedo 0.39'' the universe, ''Spiral'' the [[Tao]] philosophy,&lt;ref name="Nemo2"/&gt; ''Beaubourg'' a visit to the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] while ''China'' took inspiration from Chinese cultural and musical traditions.&lt;ref name="Nemo3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v03.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 3 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vangelis provided the score for ''[[Do You Hear the Dogs Barking?]]'' directed by [[François Reichenbach]].  This was released in 1975 and re-released two years later.&lt;ref name="Nemo3"/&gt; In 1976 Vangelis released his second soundtrack for a Rossif animal documentary, ''[[La Fête sauvage]]'', which combined African rhythms with Western music.&lt;ref name="Nemo3"/&gt; This was followed in 1979 by a third soundtrack for Rossif, ''[[Opéra sauvage]]''. Almost as well known as ''[[L'Apocalypse des animaux (album)|L'Apocalypse des animaux]]'', this soundtrack brought him to the attention of some of the world's top filmmakers. The music itself would be re-used in other films, most notably the track "L'Enfant" in ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'' (1982) by [[Peter Weir]]; the melody of the same track (in marching band format) can also be heard at the beginning of the 1924 Summer Olympics opening ceremonies scene in the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' while the track "Hymne" was used in [[Barilla Group|Barilla]] pasta commercials in Italy and [[E &amp; J Gallo Winery|Ernest &amp; Julio Gallo]] wine ads in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r83736|pure_url=yes}} All Music review of Opera.] Retrieved 2 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nemo8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v08.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 8 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rossif and Vangelis again collaborated for ''Sauvage et Beau'' (1984)&lt;ref name="Nemo7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v07.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 7 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[De Nuremberg à Nuremberg]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name="Nemo9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v09.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 9 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 Vangelis released the album ''[[Odes (album)|Odes]]'', which included Greek folk songs performed by Vangelis and actress [[Irene Papas]]. It was an instant success in Greece&lt;ref name="Nemo3"/&gt; and was followed by a second collaboration album, ''[[Rapsodies]]'', in 1986.&lt;ref name="Nemo8"/&gt; The 1980s saw the release of five solo albums; the experimental and satirical ''[[See You Later]]'' (which included "Memories of Green", later featured in the 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'') came in 1980;&lt;ref name="Nemo4"/&gt; ''[[Soil Festivities]]'' (1984) was thematically inspired by the interaction between nature and its microscopic living creatures;&lt;ref name="Nemo7"/&gt; ''[[Invisible Connections]]'' (1985) took inspiration from the world of elementary particles invisible to the naked eye;&lt;ref name="Nemo7"/&gt; ''[[Mask (Vangelis album)|Mask]]'' (1985) was inspired by the theme of the mask, an obsolete artefact which was used in ancient times for concealment or amusement;&lt;ref name="Nemo7"/&gt; and ''[[Direct (Vangelis album)|Direct]]'' (1988). The latter was the first album to be recorded in the post-Nemo Studios era.&lt;ref name="Nemo9"/&gt;

There were another five solo albums in the 1990s; ''[[The City (Vangelis album)|The City]]'' (1990) was recorded during a stay in [[Rome]] in 1989, and reflected a day of bustling city life, from dawn until dusk;&lt;ref name="Nemo9"/&gt; ''[[Voices (Vangelis album)|Voices]]'' (1995) featured sensual songs filled with nocturnal orchestrations; ''[[Oceanic (Vangelis album)|Oceanic]]'' (1996) thematically explored the mystery of underwater worlds and sea sailing;&lt;ref name="Nemo11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v11.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 11 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two classical albums about [[El Greco]] - ''[[Foros Timis Ston Greco]]'' (1995), which had a limited release, and ''[[El Greco (album)|El Greco]]'' (1998), which was an expansion of the former.&lt;ref name="Nemo12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v12.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 12 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable film work===

====''Chariots of Fire''====
[[File:London26July2012c.jpg|thumb|250px|With the stars of the stage adaptation of ''[[Chariots of Fire (play)|Chariots of Fire]]'' at the [[Gielgud Theatre]], July 2012]]
{{Main|Chariots of Fire (album)}}
In 1981, Vangelis wrote the score for the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', set at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]]. The choice of music was unorthodox as most period films featured traditional orchestral scores, whereas Vangelis' music was modern and synthesizer-heavy. The movie won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and Vangelis won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Music Score]]. The opening theme of the film was released as a single in 1982, topping the American ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' chart for one week after climbing steadily for five months.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t1534846|pure_url=yes}} AMG review of Chariots of Fire] Retrieved 25 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was used at the [[1984 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph UK"/&gt; Vangelis commented that the "main inspiration was the story itself. The rest I did instinctively, without thinking about anything else, other than to express my feelings with the technological means available to me at the time".&lt;ref name="TheGuardian2012"/&gt;

====''Blade Runner''====
{{Main|Blade Runner (soundtrack)}}
In 1982, Vangelis collaborated with director [[Ridley Scott]] to write the score for the science fiction film ''[[Blade Runner]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bladerunner.nemostudios.co.uk/ Vangelis' Blade Runner film score] Retrieved 12 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have written that in capturing the isolation and melancholy of [[Harrison Ford]]'s character, Rick Deckard, the Vangelis score is as much a part of the dystopian environment as the decaying buildings and ever-present rain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2004/02/20/vangelis-blade-runner/ Synthtopia BR review] Retrieved 27 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The score was nominated for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music#1982|BAFTA]] and [[40th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] awards.

A disagreement led to Vangelis withholding permission for his performance of the music from ''Blade Runner'' to be released, and the studio instead hired a group of musicians dubbed "The [[New American Orchestra]]" to record the official [[LP album|LP]] released at the time. It took 12 years before the disagreement was resolved and Vangelis' own work was released in the United States in 1994. The soundtrack was considered incomplete, as the film contained some non-Vangelis tracks which were not included.&lt;ref name="Intuitive Music" /&gt; Over the years a number of [[bootleg recordings]] of the ''[[Blade Runner (soundtracks)#Bootlegs|Blade Runner soundtrack]]'' from unknown sources have been released, mostly targeted to collectors as "private releases", that contain most of the music cues (including the [[The Ladd Company|Ladd Company]] [[production logo|logo]] theme).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/blade-runner-bootleg-limited-edition Answers.com review] Retrieved 25 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An official three-disc [[box set]] was released in late 2007 to commemorate the film's 25th anniversary: it contained the original 1994 album, a second disc containing some of the missing music cues and a third disc of new Vangelis material inspired by ''Blade Runner''. The 2007 release still lacks some incidental music, most notably the background music from the Taffey Lewis bar scene featuring vocals by [[Demis Roussos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.play.com/Music/CD/4-/3515011/Blade-Runner-Trilogy-25th-Anniversary-Edition/Product.html Play.com BR Tri.

====''1492: Conquest of Paradise''====
{{Main|1492: Conquest of Paradise (album)}}
In 1992, [[Paramount Pictures]] released the film ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'', also directed by [[Ridley Scott]], as a 500th anniversary commemoration of [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage to the New World. Vangelis's score was nominated as "Best Original Score – Motion Picture" at the 1993 [[Golden Globe]] awards, but was not nominated for an Academy Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/1492.html ''1492: Conquest of Paradise''] soundtrack review at [http://www.filmtracks.com/ Filmtracks.com] Retrieved 25 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to its success Vangelis won an [[Echo Music Prize|Echo Award]] as "International Artist Of The Year", and RTL Golden Lion Award for the "Best Title Theme for a TV Film or a Series" in 1996.&lt;ref name="Finder"/&gt;

In 1981 Vangelis provided the score for ''Pablo Picasso Painter'', a documentary by [[Frédéric Rossif]]. It was the third such score by Vangelis as he'd previously scored documentaries about [[Georges Mathieu]] and [[Georges Braque]]. In 1982 he composed the score of ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]'' directed by [[Costa-Gavras]], which was awarded the [[Palme d'Or]] and gained Vangelis a nomination in the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music#1982|BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]] category.&lt;ref name="Nemo5"/&gt; Other Vangelis film soundtracks include ''[[Antarctica (Vangelis album)|Antarctica]]'' for the film ''[[Nankyoku Monogatari]]'' in 1983, one of the highest-grossing movies in Japan's film history,&lt;ref name="Nemo6"/&gt; and ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' in 1984, starring [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]].&lt;ref name="Nemo7"/&gt;

For an artist of his stature, very little is known about Vangelis' personal life and he rarely gives official interviews to journalists.&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=16jp_aFRHdgC |title=New Sounds |author=John Schaefer |date=June 1985 |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=49 |issn=0886-3032}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a 2005 interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Vangelis talked openly about various parts of his life. He stated in the interview that he was "never interested" in the "decadent lifestyle" of his band days, choosing not to use alcohol or other drugs.&lt;ref name="Telegraph UK"/&gt; At the time of the ''Telegraph'' interview, Vangelis was involved in his third long-term relationship. When asked why he had not had children, Vangelis replied:
{{quote|…Because of the amount of travelling I do and the nonsense of the music business, I couldn't take care of a child in the way I think it should be taken care of.&lt;ref name="Telegraph UK"/&gt;}}

Excerpts from other interviews mention that Vangelis has been married twice before. In a 1976 interview with Dutch music magazine ''[[Oor]]'', the author wrote that Vangelis had a wife named Veronique Skawinska, a photographer who had done some [[album art]] work for Vangelis.&lt;ref name="Elsewhere Oor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangeliscollector.com/telegraph112182.htm Vangelis collector Telegraph interview] Retrieved 12 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An interview in 1982 with ''Backstage'' music magazine suggests that Vangelis had previously been married to a singer named Vana Verouti,&lt;ref&gt;[http://elsew.com/data/backst82.htm Elsewhere Backstage] Retrieved 12 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vangelismovements.com/vana.htm According to the Vangelis Movements website] not mentioning marriage to Vana, she is reported to have played again recently (2012). This website refers to Vana's own website, and includes images of Vangelis and Vana together.&lt;/ref&gt; who had performed vocals on some of his records, performing for the first time with him on ''[[La Fête sauvage]]'' and later on ''[[Heaven and Hell (Vangelis album)|Heaven and Hell]]''.

It is not publicly known where Vangelis generally resides; he has stated that he "travels around", rather than settling down in one specific place or country for long periods of time. As a hobby, Vangelis enjoys painting; his first art exhibition of 70 paintings was held at Almudin in [[Valencia]], Spain in 2003 and then toured South America until the end of 2004.&lt;ref name="Telegraph UK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheGuardian2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nemo14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v14.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 14 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vangelismovements.com/vangelispaintings.htm|title=Vangelis Paintings|publisher=Vangelis Movements|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical style and compositional process==
The musical style of Vangelis is diverse; although he primarily uses [[electronic music instrument]]s, which characterize [[electronic music]], his music has been described as a mixture of [[electronica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.udiscovermusic.com.au/rediscover-vangelis-see-you-later |title=Rediscover Vangelis' 'See You Later' |date=29 February 2016 |publisher=uDiscover |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[classical music|classical]] (his music is often [[symphony|symphonic]]), [[progressive rock]],&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ambientmusicguide.com/a-z-essential-albums/vangelis/ |title=Vangelis |author=Mike G |work=Ambient Music Guide |publisher=Mike Watson aka Mike G |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[jazz music|jazz]] (improvisations),&lt;ref name="Spin"/&gt; [[ambient music|ambient]],&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.udiscovermusic.com.au/ambient-in-20-songs |title=Ambient In 20 Songs |date=5 May 2016 |publisher=uDiscover |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]]/[[experimental music|experimental]],&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/ |title=Blade Runner Trilogy: 25th Anniversary |author=Mike Orme |date=7 February 2008 |publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World music|world]],&lt;ref name="Spin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.udiscovermusic.com.au/rediscover-china |title=Rediscover China |date=30 September 2014 |publisher=uDiscover |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New-age music|new-age]].&lt;ref name="Pitchfork"/&gt; Vangelis is often categorized as a New-age composer, but some consider it an erroneous classification. Vangelis considers it a style which "gave the opportunity for untalented people to make very boring music".&lt;ref name="Telegraph UK"/&gt;

As a musician who has always composed and played primarily on keyboards, Vangelis relies heavily on synthesizers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/tour/recording/recording.htm |title=Nemo Studios: Portrait of a studio |accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other electronic approaches to music. However, he also plays and uses many acoustic instruments (including [[folk instrument|folk]]&lt;ref name="Hischak" /&gt;) and choirs:

{{quote|I don't always play synthesizers. I play acoustic instruments with the same pleasure. I'm happy when I have unlimited choice; in order to do that, you need everything from simple acoustic sounds to electronic sounds.&lt;ref name="Spin"/&gt; Sound is sound and vibration is vibration, whether from an electronic source or an acoustic instrument.&lt;ref name="TheGuardian2012"/&gt;}}

''Synthtopia'', an electronic music review website, stated that Vangelis' music could be referred to as "symphonic electronica"&lt;ref name="Hischak" /&gt; because of his use of synthesizers in an [[orchestra]]l fashion. The site went on to describe his music as [[melodic]]: "drawing on the melodies of [[folk music]], especially the Greek music of his homeland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2004/01/17/vangelis/ |title=Review of Vangelis |date=17 January 2004 |publisher=Synthtopia |accessdate=6 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vangelis' music and compositions have also been described as "...a distinctive sound with simple, repetitive yet memorable tunes against evocative rhythms and [[chord progressions]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfiles.co.uk/composers/Vangelis.htm Mfiles biog.] Retrieved 6 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; His first electric instrument was a [[Hammond organ#Console organs|Hammond B3 organ]], while first synthesizer a [[Korg]] 700 monophonic.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt; He has often used [[vibrato]] on his synthesizers, which was carried out in a distinctive way on his [[Yamaha CS-80]] polyphonic synthesizer – varying the pressure exerted on the key to produce the expressive vibrato sound. In a 1984 interview Vangelis described the CS-80 as "The most important synthesizer in my career — and for me the best analogue synthesizer design there has ever been."&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt;

In an interview with ''Soundtrack'', a music and film website, Vangelis talked about his compositional processes. For films, Vangelis stated that he would begin composing a [[Film score|score]] for a feature as soon as he sees a rough cut of the footage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=134 Soundtrack Interview] Retrieved 6 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to working with synthesizers and other electronic instruments, Vangelis also works with and conducts orchestras. For example, in the [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', Vangelis conducted an orchestra that consisted of various [[Orchestra#Instrumentation|classical instruments]] including [[sitars]], percussion, [[finger cymbals]], harps, and [[duduk]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=4610 MFTM review of Alexander] Retrieved 6 October 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419030600/http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=4610 |date=19 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|He explains his customary method of approach. As soon as the musical idea is there, as many keyboards as possible are connected to the control-desk, which in turn are directly connected to the applicable tracks of the multi-track machine. The idea now is to play as many keyboards as possible at the same time. That way, as broad a basis as possible develops, which only needs fine-tuning. After that it's a question of adding things or leaving out things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsew.com/data/sumpts.htm Vangelis interview to ''Music Maker'' magazine, September 1982] Retrieved 20 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Vangelis once used digital sampling keyboard [[E-mu Emulator]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt; While acknowledging that computers are "extremely helpful and amazing for a multitude of scientific areas", he describes them as "insufficient and slow" for the immediate and spontaneous creation and, in terms of communication, "the worst thing that has happened for the performing musician".&lt;ref name="TheGuardian2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt; He considers that the contemporary civilization is living in a cultural "dark age" of "musical pollution". He considers musical composing a science rather than an art, similar to [[Pythagoreanism#Music and harmony|Pythagoreanism]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph UK"/&gt; He has a mystical viewpoint on music as "one of the greatest forces in the universe",&lt;ref name="TheGuardian2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/07/03/space.vangelis.reut/ |title=Greek composer Vangelis says music shaped space |date=4 July 2001 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the "music exists before we exist".&lt;ref name="Telegraph UK"/&gt; Some consider that his experience of music is a kind of [[synaesthesia]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph UK"/&gt;

==Honours and legacy==
In 1989 he received the Max Steiner Award.&lt;ref name="Finder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/vangelis_papathanassiou/ |title=Vangelis Papathanassiou by Gus Leous |date=7 March 2003 |publisher=Newsfinder.Org |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]] made Vangelis a [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters]] in 1992 and promoted him to Commander in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mounarebeiz.com/vangelis-commandeur-des-arts-et-des-lettres-3/|title=Vangelis is "Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres" (Commander in the Order of Arts and Letters)|date=3 July 2017|work=mounarebeiz.com|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well [[Legion of Honour|Chevalier de la Legion d’ Honneur]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexander-the-great.co.uk/about_the_filmmakers.htm Alexander the Great website] Retrieved 25 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/management/consultation-rights-management/vangelis_en.pdf |title=Vangelis copyright BUMA and STEMRA |author=Jacqueline A.

Williams]], rather than by the object's original discoverer, [[Eugène Joseph Delporte]], who died in 1955, long before the 1934 discovery could be confirmed by observations made in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/special/rocknroll/0006354.html Minor Planet Center web-site with info about the planet] Retrieved 25 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 and 1997 was awarded at [[World Music Awards]].&lt;ref name="Finder"/&gt;

[[NASA]] conferred their [[Public Service Medal (NASA)|Public Service Medal]] to Vangelis in 2003.

'''Wayne Denis Hall''' ([[Order of Australia|AM]]) is Inaugural Professor and Director of the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland.  He was formerly an NHMRC Australia Fellow at the [[University of Queensland]] Centre for Clinical Research (2010-2013), Professor of Public Health Policy in the School of Population Health (2005–2010) and Director of the Office of Public Policy and Ethics at Institute for Molecular Biosciences (2001–2005), at the University of Queensland. He is also a Fellow of the [[Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia]]. He has written widely on the ethical and policy issues associated with the genetics and [[neurobiology]] of addiction, mental disorders and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hcr3.isiknowledge.com/author.cgi?&amp;link1=Browse&amp;link2=Results&amp;id=2585 ISI Web of Knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wayne Hall was the Director of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of NSW during 1994 to 2001.  Since 1993, Wayne Hall has made large contribution in the field of public health in the area of drug use, addiction, treatment, ethics, and research as World Health Organization's expert adviser.  As a "Highly Cited Author" identified by the Institute for Scientific Analysis, he is dedicated to public health research with other authors such as Lucke J, Degenhardt L, Chapman S, and Gartner C.  Professor Wayne Hall is currently working as a NHMRC Australia Fellow on addiction neuroethics (see www.addiction-neuroethics.com) and his research interests include alcohol and drug research and education, cancer prevention, epidemiology, health policy, mental health, pharmacoeconomics and policy, and tobacco control.

In 2014 Hall published a review that examined the adverse effects of [[cannabis]]. This review included studies from the previous 20 years.

==Correspondence with Alexandra Feodorovna==
{{Context|section|date=August 2015}}
William Boyd-Carpenter corresponded with the last empress of Russia, [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)]]. "In early 1895 she wrote to William Boyd-Carpenter, who as Bishop of Ripon was also court chaplain to her grandmother Queen Victoria, that she was trying hard to come to terms with external trappings of her new faith. ‘Now that I am more used to hear the Russian language I can understand the service so much better, and many things have become clear to me and comprehensible which at first rather startled me.  The singing is most beautiful and edifying, only I miss the sermons, which are never preached in the Imperial chapels..."&lt;ref&gt;Janet Ashton, [http://www.alexanderpalace.org/palace/godinallthings.html "God in all things": the religious beliefs of Russia’s last empress and their personal and political context]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Long quote|date=August 2015}}

==Ancestry==
[[File:Carpenter Knight.JPG|thumb|150px|left| Sample of a medieval knight with an early Carpenter Coat of Arms on shield.]]
"Life of Lord George Carpenter", published in 1736 (five years before Carpenter's death) is stored in the [[British Museum]]. It states that he was a son of Warncomb Carpenter, who was the sixth son of Thomas Carpenter, Esq., from Holme in the parish of [[Dilwyn]], [[Herefordshire]]. The family had owned land there for over 400 years, proof of their being there by 1300.&lt;ref name="Hatton"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/c/a/r/John-R-Carpenter/FILE/0023text.txt | title=The Carpenter Family of England and the United States | author=Carpenter, J. Hatton | journal=Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine | date=April 1925 | volume=16 | issue=2 | pages=60–70 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917102535/http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/c/a/r/John-R-Carpenter/FILE/0023text.txt | archive-date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family bore [[Coat of arms|arms]] with a [[blazon]] reading "Paly of six, argent and gules, on a chevron azure, 3 cross crosslets or." The 3 cross crosslets show that an ancestor had been in the [[Crusades]] or was a Crusader, possibly [[William, Count of Melun|William de Melun]].&lt;ref name=Hatton/&gt; Their motto was ''Per acuta belli'' ("Through the asperities of war").

There is no direct male-to-male Carpenter descent connecting Lord George Carpenter and Sir William Boyd Carpenter. The family connection is by marriage through women in the family.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;Carpenter, John R. ''Carpenters' Encyclopedia of Carpenters 2009'' (DVD format). Lord George is RIN 11685.&lt;/ref&gt;
