===Format===
The season is played over fourteen rounds, allowing every team to play each other twice, once at home and once away. The top four teams on the [[Standings|ladder]] at the conclusion of the [[Season (sports)#Regular_season|regular season]] qualify for the [[Playoffs|finals series]]. In the first week of the finals series, the 1st ranked team hosts the 2nd ranked team in the major semi-final (with the winner of that match to qualify for the [[Grand Final]]) and the 3rd ranked team hosts the 4th ranked team in the minor semi-final (with the loser of that match eliminated). The loser of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the minor semi-final in the preliminary final. The winner of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the preliminary final in the Grand Final.

==Player transfers==

The '''38th [[Chess Olympiad]]''', organized by [[FIDE]] and comprising an open&lt;ref&gt;Although commonly referred to as the ''men's division'', this section is open to both male and female players.&lt;/ref&gt; and a women's tournament, as well as several other events designed to promote the game of [[chess]], took place between 12–25 November 2008 in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/calendar FIDE Calendar 2008]. fide.com&lt;/ref&gt; There were 146 teams in the open event and 111 in the women's event. In total, 1277 players were registered.

Both tournament sections were officiated by [[International Arbiter|international arbiter]] [[Ignatius Leong]] ([[Singapore]]). In a change from recent Olympiads, the number of rounds of the [[Swiss system tournament|Swiss system]] were reduced from 13 to 11 with [[accelerated pairings]]. For the first time, the women's division, like the open division, was played over four boards per round, with each team allowed one alternate for a total of five players. In another first, the final rankings were determined by match points, not game points. In the event of a draw, the tie-break was decided by 1. Deducted [[Sonneborn-Berger]]; 2. Deducted sum of match points; 3. Game points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=95&amp;view=article FIDE Handbook] Retrieved on 2012-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[time control]] for each game permitted each player 90 minutes their first 40 moves and 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an additional 30 seconds increment for each player after each move, beginning with the first. As a new rule, no [[Draw by agreement|draws by agreement]] were permitted before 30 moves had been completed. Yet there were games drawn as soon as the 16th move, formally drawn by repetition against which there was no rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090131211339/http://schachlive.dresden2008.de/games/m/9/2/2/index.eng.html Dresden 2008]. dresden2008.de&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, players who were not present at the board at the commencement of a round automatically forfeited the game. This rule was implemented to align chess with other sports events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://main.uschess.org/content/view/8893/141/ Let the Games Begin in Dresden] uschess.org, Mike Klein, 13 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open event==
[[File:Dresden Olympiad 2008.jpg|thumb|500px|Dresden Olympiad Scene]]
The open division was contested by 146 teams representing 141 nations. Germany, as hosts, fielded three teams, whilst the ''[[International Braille Chess Association]]'' (IBCA), the ''International Physically Disabled Chess Association'' (IPCA), and the ''International Committee of Silent Chess'' (ICSC) each provided one squad. [[Morocco]] were signed up, but never appeared for their first round match and were disqualified.

Defending champions [[Armenia]], once again led by [[Levon Aronian]], clinched their second consecutive title. Despite being seeded only eighth, they won nine out of eleven matches, drew against fourth-placed [[Ukraine]] and lost only (1½-2½) to runners-up [[Israel]], captained by [[Boris Gelfand]]. The Israelis finished one point behind Armenia. The [[United States]], led by [[Gata Kamsky]], took the bronze medals on a better tie break score than [[Vasyl Ivanchuk]] and the rest of the Ukrainian team after defeating Ukraine (3½-½) in the last round.

Once again, the Russian team under captain [[Vladimir Kramnik]] were the pre-tournament favourites but finished disappointingly in fifth place. Kramnik, having recently lost a [[World Chess Championship 2008|world championship match]], performed well below his rating, as did the rest of the team, except alternate [[Dmitry Yakovenko]] who won the reserve board.

Arguably the biggest surprise of the tournament was [[Vietnam]], who weren't even seeded in the top 30, but still managed to finish in ninth place, aided somewhat by the new tournament structure which allotted them some weaker opponents, although they did manage a 2-2 result against [[China]]. The German hosts finished 13th, while [[India]], without World Champion [[Viswanathan Anand]], had to settle for 16th place.

===Group prizes===

In addition to the overall medals, prizes were given out to the best teams in five different seeding groups—in other words, the teams who exceeded their seeding the most. Overall medal winners were not eligible for group prizes.

===Individual medals===

For the first time, all board prizes were given out according to [[Performance rating (chess)|performance ratings]]. Accordingly, there was no overall prize, although Sargissian on the third board had the best performance of all players at the tournament:

* Board 1: {{flagicon|HUN}} [[Peter Leko]] 2834
* Board 2: {{flagicon|ARM}} [[Vladimir Akopian]] 2813
* Board 3: {{flagicon|ARM}} [[Gabriel Sargissian]] 2869
* Board 4: {{flagicon|MNE}} [[Dragisa Blagojevic]] 2792
* Reserve: {{flagicon|RUS}} [[Dmitry Yakovenko]] 2794

==Women's section==

The women's division was contested by 111 teams representing 106 nations. Germany, as hosts, fielded three teams, whilst the ''[[International Braille Chess Association]]'' (IBCA), the ''International Physically Disabled Chess Association'' (IPCA), and the ''International Committee of Silent Chess'' (ICSC) each provided one squad.

[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] won their fourth title, 12 years after the third one, narrowly defeating [[Ukraine]] on tie breaks. The two teams didn't meet during the tournament, but when the Ukrainians only drew their penultimate match against [[Serbia]] while the Georgians defeated former champions [[China]] (2½-1½), the gold was Georgia's to lose. In the last round they record a win (3-1) against the Serbian, who thus came to play a crucial role in the fight for the title, despite finishing in seventh place themselves. The Georgian team were led by former World Champion, 47-year-old [[Maia Chiburdanidze]], who delivered a stellar performance, winning the top board with the best performance of the tournament.

The [[United States]] clinched the bronze medals on tie breaks, just ahead of [[Russia]] (with newly crowned World Champion [[Alexandra Kosteniuk]]) and [[Poland]]. The German hosts finished in 21st place.

Académica's only rivalry is with [[CS Mindelense]], one of the longest in Cape Verde and the second longest in the region.  After the creation of the regional division in 2008, the rivalry did not appear in one part of the early 2010s up until 2014 as Académica played in the Second Division.  It appeared in other regional competitions.

At the national rival, their rival was with [[Sporting Clube da Praia|Sporting Praia]] from the island of Santiago  Sporting's rivalry with Académica Mindelo entirely disappeared today, a tiny part was the national championship restructuring for the upcoming 2017 season done in November 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15245">'''Combined''' is an event in [[Alpine skiing|alpine ski racing]]. A traditional combined competition consists of one run of [[Downhill (ski competition)|downhill]] and two runs of [[Slalom skiing|slalom]], each discipline run on separate days. The winner is the skier with the fastest aggregate time. (Until the 1990s, a complicated point system was used to determine placings in the combined event.) A modified version, the super combined, is a speed race (downhill or [[super-G]]) and only one run of slalom, with both portions scheduled on the same day.

==History==
The first [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships|World Championships]] in [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1931|1931]] did not include the combined event, but it was added to the program in [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1932|1932]]. [[Alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics]] was not included until [[Alpine skiing at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]], and the combined was the only event. The combined was one of three medal events at the next Olympics in [[Alpine skiing at the 1948 Winter Olympics|1948]], along with downhill and slalom. The combined used the results of the only downhill race with two runs of combined slalom. The regular slalom (two runs) was held the following day.

With the introduction of [[giant slalom]] at the world championships in [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1950|1950]], the combined event disappeared from the Olympics for four decades, until re-introduced in [[Alpine skiing at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. From 1948 through [[Alpine skiing at the 1980 Winter Olympics|1980]], the Winter Olympics also served as the world championships, with two sets of medals awarded. The world champion in the combined was determined "on paper" by the results of the three races of downhill, giant slalom, and slalom.  The top three finishers in the combined event were awarded world championship medals by the FIS, but not Olympic medals from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]. This three-race paper method was used from [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1954|1954]] through 1980; no FIS medals were awarded for the combined in 1950 or [[Alpine skiing at the 1952 Winter Olympics|1952]]. A separate downhill and slalom for the combined event was added to the world championships in [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1982|1982]], and the Olympics in 1988.

The world championships were held annually from 1931 through [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1939|1939]], were interrupted by [[World War II]], and resumed as a biennial event at the 1948 Olympics, held in even-numbered years through 1982. They skipped the [[Alpine skiing at the 1984 Winter Olympics|1984 Olympics]] and have been scheduled for odd-numbered years since [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1985|1985]]. (The [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1995|1995]] event was postponed to [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996|1996]], due to lack of snow in southeastern [[Spain]].)

At the Winter Olympics and world championships, the slalom and downhill portions of a combined event are run separately from the regular downhill and slalom events on shorter, and often less demanding, race courses. On the [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|World Cup]] circuit, traditional combined events have been "paper races," combining skiers' times from a separately scheduled downhill race and slalom race, generally held at the same location over two days. In 2005, the FIS began to replace these "calculated" combineds with super combined events, held on one day, which administrators hope will result in increased participation.&lt;ref name=srcldr&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://skiracing.com/stories/fis-spring-calendar-conference-highlights/ |magazine=Ski Racing |last=Rugh |first=Pete |title=FIS Spring Calendar Conference Highlights |date= May 10, 2005 |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Super Combined==
A modified version, the super combined, is a speed race (downhill or [[super-G]]) and only one run of slalom, with both portions scheduled on the same day.
===World Cup===
The first super combined was a World Cup race held in [[2005 Alpine Skiing World Cup|2005]] in [[Lauberhorn|Wengen]], [[Switzerland]], on January 14th; [[Benjamin Raich]] of [[Austria]] was the winner. The first women's race in the new format was run six weeks later in [[San Sicario Fraiteve|San Sicario]], [[Italy]]; won by [[Croatia]]'s [[Janica Kostelić]] on February 27th. The [[2006 Alpine Skiing World Cup|2006]] World Cup calendar included three super combineds and just one traditional combined race on the men's side, while the women raced two super combineds and no traditional combineds. Kostelić won the first three women's World Cup super combineds.

Beginning with the [[2007 Alpine Skiing World Cup|2007]] season, the FIS began awarding a fifth discipline-champion "crystal globe" to the points winner of combined races; the 2007 season included five combined races for each gender.&lt;ref name=sswcs&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://skiracing.com/stories/2006-07-world-cup-award-super-combined-crystal-globe/ |magazine=Ski Racing |last=Rugh |first=Pete |title=2006-07 World Cup to award super combined crystal globe |date=April 17, 2006 |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine out of the ten scheduled combineds use the new super-combined format, the only exception was [[Hahnenkamm, Kitzbühel|Kitzbühel]], [[Austria]], which continued with the traditional two-run format (K), albeit in a "paper race." The change to super combined expectedly resulted in major disapproval from the slalom specialists, the loudest critic being [[Ivica Kostelić]]. Even with the change to a single slalom run, many speed skiers believe the technical racers have the advantage in the super combined.&lt;ref name=reuol14&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/13/olympics-alpineskiing-combined-idUSL5N0LI22D20140213 |publisher=Reuters |last=Breidthardt |first=Annika |title=Olympics-Alpine skiing-Downhill champion Mayer scorns super-combined format |date=February 13, 2014 |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fssraadv&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/sports/for-some-ski-racers-an-advantage-before-the-season-even-starts.html?_r=0

===World Championships and Winter Olympics===
The super combined format debuted at the world championships in [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2007|2007]] in [[Åre Ski Area|Åre]], [[Sweden]], and at the Winter Olympics in [[Alpine skiing at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] at [[Whistler Blackcomb|Whistler]],&lt;!--[[British Columbia|B.C.]],--&gt; [[Canada]].

The '''BB&amp;T Center''' (previously known as the '''National Car Rental Center''', '''Office Depot Center''', and '''BankAtlantic Center''') is an [[list of indoor arenas|indoor arena]] located in [[Sunrise, Florida]]. It is the home venue for the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL)'s [[Florida Panthers]].  It was completed in 1998, at a cost of US$185 million, almost entirely publicly financed, and features 70 suites and 2,623 club seats.&lt;ref name="Facts and Figures"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:BB&amp;TCenterAerial.jpg|left|thumb|An aerial shot of the BB&amp;T Center]]
In 1992, [[Wayne Huizenga]] obtained a new NHL franchise that would eventually become the Florida Panthers.&lt;ref name=panthers/&gt; Until the team had an arena of their own, they initially played at the now-demolished [[Miami Arena]], sharing the venue with the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Miami Heat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=N.H.L. Is Going to Disneyland, and South Florida, Too|first=Joe|last=Lapointe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/11/sports/hockey-nhl-is-going-to-disneyland-and-south-florida-too.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 1992|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sunrise, Florida|Sunrise]] City Manager Pat Salerno made public a $167-million financing and construction plan  for a [[civic center]] near the [[Sawgrass Expressway]] in December 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sunrise Gets Serious About Arena|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-12-16/news/9512150291_1_civic-center-bed-tax-salerno|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|location=Fort Lauderdale|date=December 16, 1995|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] approved construction in February 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prospects Good For Broward Arena|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-02-01/news/9601310426_1_arena-plans-broward-county-bed-tax|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|location=Fort Lauderdale|date=February 1, 1996|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1996, the site was chosen by the Panthers, and in July, Alex Muxo gathered more than a dozen architects, engineers and contractors for the first major design brainstorming session. Architects [[Ellerbe Becket]] were given 26 months to build the arena, which had to be ready by August 30, 1998, to accommodate the [[1998–99 NHL season]]. Despite never having designed a facility that had taken less than 31 months from start to finish, they accepted the job.&lt;ref name=panthers&gt;{{cite web |title=Panthers History: Arenas|url=http://panthers.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=61370|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventy suites were completed with [[wet bar]]s, closed circuit monitors and leather upholstery. Averaging over {{convert|650|sqft|m2}}, the suites are the largest in the country for this type of facility. All the activity was generated by over 50 subcontractors and 2.3 million man hours without a single injury.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Known as Broward County Civic Center during construction, the [[naming rights]] were won in July 1998 by [[National Car Rental]]—a company purchased by Huizenga in January 1997—leading to the venue being named the National Car Rental Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Huizenga's National Car Rental To Be Name Gracing Hockey Arena|first1=Alan|last1=Snell|first2=David|last2=Fleshler|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-07-11/news/9807110071_1_huizenga-rights-deal-team-s-new-arena|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|location=Fort Lauderdale|date=July 11, 1998|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[certificate of occupancy]] was given on September 12, and the arena opened on October 3 with a [[Celine Dion]] concert. The next day, [[Elton John]] performed, and on October 9 the Panthers had their first home game at the new arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sunrise Arena Ok'd For Occupancy|first=Robert|last=Nolin|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-09-12/news/9809120035_1_new-arena-permanent-certificate-occupancy|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|location=Fort Lauderdale|date=September 12, 1998|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As NRC's new parent company [[ANC Rental]] went bankrupt in 2002, the Panthers sought a new sponsor for the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panthers Want Car Rental Name Taken Off Arena|first=Sarah|last=Talalay|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2002-08-16/news/0208160136_1_anc-rental-corp-panthers-car|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|location=Fort Lauderdale|date=August 16, 2002|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later became the [[Office Depot]] Center in the summer of 2002, and the BankAtlantic Center on September 6, 2005. As [[BB&amp;T]] purchased [[BankAtlantic]] in July 2012, two months later the arena was rebranded as BB&amp;T Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=BB&amp;T Center Naming Rights Headline Long-term Florida Panthers-BB&amp;T Partnership|url=https://www.nhl.com/panthers/news/bb-t-center-naming-rights-headline-long-term-florida-panthers-bb-t-partnership/c-641153|publisher=Florida Panthers|website=NHL.com|date=September 10, 2012|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Florida Panthers’ Arena Now BB&amp;T Center|first=George|last=Richards|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/09/11/2995653/florida-panthers-arena-takes-bbt.html|newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=September 11, 2012|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BB&amp;T Center is currently the largest arena in Florida and second-largest in the Southeastern United States, behind [[Greensboro Coliseum]].

During the 2011 offseason, the BB&amp;T Center replaced the original green seats in the lower bowl with new red seats, as a part of the Panthers' "We See Red" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Panthers See Red In BankAtlantic Center Lower Bowl|url=http://panthers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=569939|publisher=National Hockey League|date=July 25, 2011|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Sunrise Sports and Entertainment completed installation of the Club Red seating sections encompassing the center ice seats during hockey games. It is an all-inclusive nightclub experience following the trend of other sports and entertainment venues in incorporating high-end seating sections and clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Club Red elevates experiences at BB&amp;T Center|first=Miriam|last=Valverde|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-01-29/news/fl-panthers-club-red-20130123_1_hockey-fans-bb-t-center-hockey-game|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|location=Fort Lauderdale|date=January 29, 2013|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADT Club located on the club level offers food and beverage. The Duffy's Sky Club at the BB&amp;T Center encompasses approximately 8,000 square feet and caters to approximately 500 guests. The Penalty Box offers fans another seating and dining option inside the BB&amp;T Center. The Legends Lounge is a restaurant located on the Lexus Suite Level and offers sit down service.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
  
The BB&amp;T Center is also the home for private lounge box seating.

On May 14, 2013, Broward County voted to fund a new scoreboard for the county-owned BB&amp;T Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=County to Fund New Scoreboard for Panthers Arena|first=Robert|last=Nolin|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-05-14/news/fl-commission-arena-20130514_1_new-scoreboard-panthers-arena-panthers-president-michael-yormark|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|location=Fort Lauderdale|date=May 14, 2013|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 11, 2013, the scoreboard made its debut for the Panthers' 2013–14 home opener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Huizenga Joins Viola to Christen New Panthers Era Before 6-3 Win|first=Craig|last=Davis|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-10-11/sports/sfl-huizenga-viola-christen-new-panthers-era-20131011_1_jonathan-huberdeau-aleksander-barkov-jacob-markstrom|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|location=Fort Lauderdale|date=October 11, 2013|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Des Moines Coliseum''' was a building located in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. Opened in 1908, it served as the main venue for large public events in Des Moines for four decades. [[Herbert Hoover]] launched his 1932 re-election campaign from the Coliseum, and several other U.S. Presidents spoke there, including [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[William Howard Taft]].  [[Drake University]] played basketball in the Coliseum for a number of years, and it was used for wrestling, boxing, ice skating, and circus events. It was destroyed by fire on August 13, 1949. A YMCA was later built on the site, but that was torn down in 2015 and the site now sits empty (as of 2016).

'''Fantazzle''' was a fantasy sports website that allowed users to play daily, weekly, and seasonal fantasy sports games. Some of the games they offered were free, while others required a monetary deposit. Every game Fantazzle offered resulted in an immediate cash prize. The  website has since been shut down.

==History==
Fantazzle launched in September 2008. They are members of the [[Fantasy Sports Trade Association]] (FSTA). In January 2009, Fantazzle was recognized jointly by the FSTA and the Fantasy Football Librarian as the winner of the 2008 Fantasy Football Projection Accuracy Challenge in its first year.&lt;ref name="press"&gt;"Press Release - Fantazzle Fantasy Sports Games Announces Schedule for the 2011-2012 Fantasy Football and College Fantasy Football Season!"

In 2010, Fantazzle released a [[white paper]] on the impact of [[fantasy sports]] has on [[Counterproductive work behavior|workplace]] productivity.  With multiple sources and facts, Fantazzle stated that [[fantasy sports]] did not slow down workplace productivity. They proposed that many businesses are not negatively affected by employees engaging in the activity. The [[white papers]] went on to say that fantasy sports have proved to be a valuable [[team-building|team building]] exercise that leads to increased employee [[loyalty]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Zack. "Fantazzle Releases White Paper on Fantasy Games in the Workplace." FantasyFootballSportal.com. 16 Dec. 2010. Web. 25 Jan. 2012. &lt;http://www.fantasyfootballsportal.com/fantasy-football/fantazzle-releases-white-paper-fantasy-games-workplace/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Fantazzle picked up a sponsorship from current [[Baltimore Ravens]] running back [[Ray Rice]]. Ray Rice had this to say about Fantazzle: "Wanted you all to check out Fantazzle Fantasy Games. Fantazzle has cool fantasy games for baseball, racing, golf and, of course, football. In the upcoming months, we'll have a Ray Rice fantasy football game I'll be sponsoring with free autographed and cash prizes.”&lt;ref&gt;"Press Release - Fantazzle Fantasy Sports, Ray Rice of the Baltimore Ravens, and CurvSports.com Announce a New Sponsorship for Fantazzle's Fantasy Football Games and Fantasy Sports Games Site."

Fantazzle offered merchandise autographed by Steve Smith to those that won select fantasy games.&lt;ref&gt;"Fantasy Football Promotion | Fantasy Football Games - Fantazzle Fantasy Sports."

==Games==
Fantazzle offers [[Fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]], [[fantasy baseball]], fantasy soccer, [[fantasy basketball]], [[fantasy golf]], fantasy racing, [[fantasy hockey]], fantasy poker, and fantasy games for [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|March Madness]]. In 2011, Fantazzle became one of the first daily fantasy sports websites to offer [[college football]] fantasy games.&lt;ref&gt;"Weekly Fantasy Games | Daily Fantasy Games - Fantazzle Fantasy Sports." Fantasy Baseball Games | College Fantasy Football | Fantasy Football Games.

===Game Formats===
Fantazzle offers daily games, weekly games, twice-a-week games, monthly games, and season-long games. In addition to traditional fantasy sports formats, Fantazzle offers a Pick ‘em game, which allows users to choose different players that are matched up one-on-one with another similar player for a particular stat. Users would then pick which player will have a better performance in that stat. For example, one quarterback would be matched up against another quarterback, and touchdown passes would be compared. If the user chose QB1, who ended up passing for 100 yards and 2 TD, and QB2 passed for 200 yards and 1 TD, then the user would win, because only touchdown passes counted for that matchup. These matchups can be with any position and any sport.&lt;ref name="press" /&gt;

==Affiliated websites==
Fantazzle is also affiliated with a number of blogs, including Weekly Fantasy Sportal, Fantasy Football Sportal, and Fantasy Baseball Sportal. These blogs are updated periodically to give users fantasy sports advice. Fantazzle also offers a [[podcast]], in which discussions on different [[fantasy sports]] are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Parr, Ryan. "Fantasy Football Games Podcast." Fantazzle Blog. Fantazzle Fantasy Sports, 13 Dec. 2009. Web. 06 Jan. 2012. &lt;http://www.fantazzleblog.com/2009/12/fantasy-football-podcast-midnight-oil/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Field lacrosse''' is a [[full contact sport|full contact]] outdoor men's [[sport]] played with ten players on each team. The sport originated among [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and the modern rules of field lacrosse were initially codified by Canadian [[William George Beers]] in 1867. Field lacrosse is one of three major versions of [[lacrosse]] played internationally. The other versions, [[women's lacrosse]] (established in the 1890s) and [[box lacrosse]] (originated in the 1930s), are played under significantly different rules.

The object of the game is to use a [[lacrosse stick]], or crosse, to catch, carry, and pass a solid rubber ball in an effort to score by shooting the ball into the opponent's goal. The triangular head of the lacrosse stick has a loose net strung into it that allows the player to hold the [[lacrosse ball]]. In addition to the lacrosse stick, players are required to wear a certain amount of protective equipment. Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact.  The rules limit the number of players in each part of the field. It is sometimes referred to as the "fastest sport on two feet".

Lacrosse is governed internationally by the 59-member [[Federation of International Lacrosse]], which sponsors the [[World Lacrosse Championship]]s once every four years. A former [[Olympic sport]], attempts to reinstate it to the Olympics have been hampered by insufficient international participation. Field lacrosse is played professionally in North America by [[Major League Lacrosse]]. It is also played on a high amateur level by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] in the United States, the [[List of Australian Lacrosse National Champions|Australian Senior Lacrosse Championship]] series, and the [[Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association]].

[[File:Ball players.jpg|right|thumb|"Ball players" painted by [[George Catlin]], illustrates various Native Americans playing lacrosse.]]
Lacrosse is a traditional [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] game.&lt;ref name=Vennum9&gt;Vennum, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Liss13&gt;Liss, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Native American  beliefs, playing lacrosse is a spiritual act used for healing and giving thanks to the "Creator". They would also play the game to resolve minor conflicts between tribes that were not worth going to war for, thus the name "little brother of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rock|first=Tom|title=More Than a Game|work=Lacrosse Magazine|publisher =US Lacrosse|date=November–December 2002|url=http://www.redhawkslax.com/news.lacrossemag.html|accessdate=2009-03-19|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080525231804/http://www.redhawkslax.com/news.lacrossemag.html |archivedate = May 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; These games could last several days and as many as 100 to 1,000 men from opposing villages or tribes played on open plains, between goals ranging from {{convert|500|yd}} to several miles apart.&lt;ref name="STX"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stxlacrosse.com/theculture/history.cfm| title = Lacrosse History|publisher=STX Lacrosse| accessdate = 2008-11-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080406011926/http://www.stxlacrosse.com/theculture/history.cfm |archivedate = April 6, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vennum, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Great Lakes region, players used an entirely wooden stick, while the Iroquois stick was longer and was laced with string, and the [[Southeastern tribes]] played with two shorter sticks, one in each hand.&lt;ref name=piet/&gt;&lt;ref name="vennumhistory"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vennum Jr.|first1=Thomas|title=The History of Lacrosse|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/about-the-sport/history|publisher=US Lacrosse|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, [[Montreal Lacrosse Club]] member William George Beers codified the modern game. He established the [[Canadian Lacrosse Association]] and created the first written rules for the game, ''Lacrosse: The National Game of Canada''. The book specified field layout, lacrosse ball dimensions, lacrosse stick length, number of players, and number of goals required to determine the match winner.&lt;ref name=piet&gt;Pietramala, pp. 8-10&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
Field lacrosse involves two teams, each competing to shoot a [[lacrosse ball]] into the opposing team's goal. A lacrosse ball is made out of solid [[rubber]], measuring 7.75 to 8&amp;nbsp;inches (19.7–20&amp;nbsp;cm) in [[circumference]] and weighing 5 to 5.25&amp;nbsp;ounces (140–149&amp;nbsp;g). Each team plays with ten players on the field: a goalkeeper; three defenders in the defensive end; three midfielders free to roam the whole field; and three attackers attempting to score goals in the offensive end. Players are required to wear some protective equipment, and must carry a [[lacrosse stick]] (or crosse) that meets specifications. Rules dictate the length of the game, boundaries, and allowable activity. Penalties are assessed by officials for any transgression of the rules.&lt;ref name = "Lacrosse rules"/&gt;

The game has undergone significant changes since Beers' original codification. In the 1930s, the number of players on the field per team was reduced from twelve to ten, rules about protective equipment were established, and the field was shortened.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, pp. 131-132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Piet14&gt;Pietramala, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Playing area ===
[[File:Mens lacrosse diagram.svg|thumb|right|400px|Diagram of a men's college lacrosse field.]] 
A standard lacrosse field is {{convert|110|yd|m}} in length from each endline, and {{convert|60|yd|m}} in width from the sidelines.&lt;ref name = "ilf rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://filacrosse.com/wp-content/downloads/men/Rules/FIL_MF_Rulebook_2017-2018-A4v1-1.pdf |title=2017-2018 Rules of Men’s Field Lacrosse |publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse |accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =ncaa1&gt;NCAA Rulebook, Rule 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Field lacrosse goals are centered between each sideline, positioned {{convert|15|yd|m}} from each endline and {{convert|80|yd|m}} apart from one another. Positioning the goals well within the endlines allows play to occur behind them. The goal is {{convert|6|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|6|ft|m}} tall, with nets attached in a pyramid shape. Surrounding each goal is a circular area known as the "crease," measuring {{convert|18|ft|m}} in [[diameter]].&lt;ref name =ncaa1/&gt;

If a player enters the "crease" while shooting toward the goal, the referee will call a foul and the ball gets turned over to the other team.

A pair of lines, {{convert|20|yd|m}} from both the midfield line and each goal line, divides the field into three sections. From each team's point of view, the one nearest its own goal is its defensive area, then the midfield area, followed by the attack or offensive area. These trisecting lines are called "restraining lines." A [[right angle]] line is marked {{convert|10|yd|m}} from each sideline connecting each endline to the nearer restraining line, creating the "restraining box."&lt;ref name =ncaa1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; If an official deems that a team is "stalling," that is not moving with offensive purpose while controlling the ball, the possessing team must keep the ball within the offensive restraining box to avoid a loss-of-possession penalty.&lt;ref name = ncaa6&gt;NCAA Rulebook, Rule 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Field markings dictate player positioning during a [[Faceoff#Other sports|face-off]]. A face-off is how play is started at the beginning of each quarter and after each goal. During a face-off, there are six players (without considering goalkeepers) in each of the areas defined by the restraining lines. Three midfielders from each team occupy the midfield area, while three attackmen and three of the opposing team's defensemen occupy each offensive area. These players must stay in these areas until possession is earned by a midfielder or the ball crosses either restraining line. Wing areas are marked on the field on the midfield line {{convert|10|yd|m}} from each sideline. This line indicates where the two nonface-off midfielders per team lineup during a face-off situation. These players may position themselves on either side of the midfield line.&lt;ref name =ncaa1/&gt;  During a face-off, two players lay their sticks horizontally next to the ball, head of the stick inches from the ball and the butt-end pointing down the midfield line. Once the official blows the whistle to start play, the face-off midfielders scrap for the ball to earn possession and the other midfielders advance to play the ball. If possession is won by the face-off player, he may move the ball himself or pass to a teammate.&lt;ref name = "Lacrosse rules"/&gt;

The rules also require that substitution areas, a penalty box, coaches area, and team bench areas be designated on the field.&lt;ref name =ncaa1/&gt;

=== Equipment ===
A field lacrosse player's equipment includes a [[lacrosse stick]], and protective equipment, including a [[lacrosse helmet]] with face mask, [[lacrosse gloves]], and arm and shoulder pads. Players are also required to wear [[mouthguards]] and [[Jockstrap|athletic supporter]] with cup pocket and [[jockstrap#Protective cup|protective cup]].&lt;ref name = "Lacrosse rules"/&gt;

[[File:lacrosseplayer.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A typically equipped field player, carrying a "short crosse"]]

Each player carries a lacrosse stick measuring {{convert|40|to(-)|42|in|m}} long (a "short crosse"), or {{convert|52|to(-)|72|in|m}} long (a "long crosse"). In most modern circles the word ''crosse'' has been replaced by "stick" and the terms "short stick" and "long stick" or "pole" are used. On each team up to four players at a time may use a long crosse: the three defensemen and one midfielder. The crosse is made up of the head and the shaft (or handle). The head is roughly triangular in shape and is loosely strung with [[mesh]] or leathers and nylon strings to form a "pocket" that allows the ball to be caught, carried, and thrown. In field lacrosse, the pocket of the crosse is illegal if the top of the ball, when placed in the head of the stick, is below the bottom of the stick's sidewall. 

[[File:lacrosse head diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Head of a men's lacrosse stick]]

The maximum width of the head at its widest point must be between {{convert|6|and(-)|10|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name = "ilf rules"/&gt;&lt;ref name =ncaa1/&gt; From 1.25-inches up from the bottom of the head, the distance between the sidewalls of the crosse must be at least 3&amp;nbsp;inches. Most modern sticks have a tubular metal shaft, usually made of aluminum, titanium, or alloys, while the head is made of hard plastic. Metal shafts must have a plastic or rubber cap at the end.

The sport's growth has been hindered by the cost of a player's equipment: a uniform, helmet, shoulder pads, hand protection, and lacrosse sticks. Many players have at least two lacrosse sticks prepared for use in any contest.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally players used sticks made by Native American craftsman. These were expensive and, at times, difficult to find.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vennum, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of the plastic heads in the 1970s gave players an alternative to the wooden stick,&lt;ref name="STX"/&gt; and their mass production has led to greater accessibility and expansion of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Players ===

==== Goalkeeper ====
{{Main article|Goaltender (field lacrosse)}}

[[File:LacrosseGoalie (cropped).jpg|thumb|A goalkeeper making a save]] 
The goalkeeper's responsibility is to prevent the opposition from scoring by directly defending the {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} by {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} goal.&lt;ref name = ncaa1/&gt; A goalkeeper needs to stop shots that are capable of reaching over {{convert|100|mph|km/h}}, and is responsible for directing the team's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1092325/index.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121203043421/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1092325/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 3, 2012 |title=Joy Is Having No Red Bruises |last=Donovan |first=Mark |date=April 25, 1977 |publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=2009-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pietramala, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Goalkeepers have special privileges when they are in the crease, a circular area surrounding each goal with a [[radius]] of {{convert|9|ft|m}}. Offensive players may not play the ball or make contact with the goalkeeper while he is in the crease. Once a goalkeeper leaves the crease, he loses these privileges.&lt;ref name = ncaa4&gt;NCAA Rulebook, Rule 4&lt;/ref&gt;

A goalkeeper's equipment differs from other players'. Instead of shoulder pads and elbow pads, the goalkeeper wears a chest protector. He also wears special "goalie gloves" that have extra padding on the thumb to protect from shots. The head of a goalkeeper's crosse may measure up to {{convert|15|in|cm}} wide, significantly larger than field players'.&lt;ref name = ncaa1/&gt;

==== Defensemen ====
A defenseman is a player position whose responsibility is to assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field.&lt;ref name = ncaa2&gt;NCAA Rulebook, Rule 2&lt;/ref&gt; Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass, by doing this they will need to cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pietramala, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Tactics used by a defensemen include body positioning and checking. Checking is attempting to dispossess the opposition of the ball through body or stick contact. A check may include a "poke check", where a defensemen thrusts his crosse at the top hand or crosse of the opponent in possession of the ball (similar to a [[billiards]] shot), or a "slap check", where a player applies a short, two-handed slap to the hand or crosse of the opponent in possession of the ball.&lt;ref&gt;Pietramala, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; A "body check" is allowed as long as the ball is in possession or a loose ball is within five yards of the opposing player and the contact is made to the front or side of the [[torso]] of the opposing player.&lt;ref name = ncaa5/&gt; Defensemen preferably remain in a position relative to their offensive counterpart known as "topside", which generally means a stick and body position that forces a ball carrier to go another direction, usually away from the goal.&lt;ref&gt;LAXICON - the Lacrosse Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Midfielders ====
[[Image:Mens Lax 1.jpg|thumb|A lacrosse player shooting during a game.]]
Midfielders contribute offensively and defensively and may roam the entire playing area. Each team fields three midfielders at a time. One midfielder per team may use a long crosse,&lt;ref name = ncaa2/&gt; and in this case is referred to as a "long-stick midfielder."&lt;ref name=lsm/&gt; Long-stick midfielders are normally used for defensive possessions and face-offs but can participate in offense as long as he is not subbed off.

Over time, the midfield position has developed into a position of specialties. During play, teams may substitute players in and out freely, a practice known as "on the fly" substitution. The rules state that substitution must occur within the designated exchange area in front of the players' bench.&lt;ref name = "Lacrosse rules"/&gt; Teams frequently rotate the midfielder specialists off and on the field depending on the ball possession. Some teams have a designated [[face-off midfielder]], referred to as a "fogo" midfielder (an acronym for "face-off and get-off"), who takes the majority of face-offs and is quickly substituted after the face-off.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeager|first=John M |title=Our Game: The Character and Culture of Lacrosse|publisher=NPR Inc|year=2005|pages=17–18|isbn=1-887943-99-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A_FcMiscWi0C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=lacrosse+fogo|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some teams also designate midfielders as "offensive midfielders" or "defensive midfielders" depending on their strengths and weaknesses.

==== Attackman ====
Each team fields three attackmen at a time, and these players generally remain on the offensive half of the field.&lt;ref name = ncaa2/&gt; An attackman uses a short crosse.  These are the players who score most of the goals.&lt;ref name="Lacrosse rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/LC18.pdf |title=Men's Lacrosse 2017 and 2018 Rules |publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association |accessdate=15 November 2017 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duration and tie-breaking methods ===
Duration of games depends upon the level of play. In international competition, [[college lacrosse]], and [[Major League Lacrosse]], the total playing time is 60&amp;nbsp;minutes, composed of four 15-minute quarters.&lt;ref name = "ilf rules"/&gt;&lt;ref name = ncaa3/&gt;  High school games typically consist of four 12-minute quarters but can be played in 30-minute halves, while youth leagues may have shorter games.&lt;ref name = "Lacrosse rules"/&gt;  The clock typically stops during all dead ball situations such as between goals or if the ball goes out of bounds.  The method of breaking a [[Tie (draw)|tie]] generally consists of multiple [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] periods of 5 minutes (4 in NCAA play) in which whoever scores a goal is awarded a [[sudden victory]]. A quicker variant of the sudden victory is the Braveheart method in which each team sends out one player and one goalie; it is then sudden victory.&lt;ref name = ncaa3&gt;NCAA Rulebook, Rule 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-lacrosse.com/laxicon.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227225121/http://www.e-lacrosse.com/laxicon.html |archivedate=2013-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  International lacrosse plays two straight 5-minute overtime periods, and then applies the sudden victory rule if the score is still tied.&lt;ref name = "ilf rules"/&gt;

=== Ball movement and out of play ===
[[File:Face-off.jpg|thumb|left|A face-off]]
Teams must advance the ball or be subjected to loss of possession. Once a team gains possession of the ball in their defensive area, they must move the ball over the midfield line within 20 seconds. If the goalkeeper has possession of the ball in the crease he must pass the ball or vacate the area within four seconds. Failure by the goalkeeper to leave the crease will result in the opposite team being given possession just outside the restraining box.&lt;ref name = "Lacrosse rules"/&gt; Once the ball crosses the midfield line, a team has 10 seconds to move the ball into the offensive area designated by the restraining box or forfeit possession to their opponents.&lt;ref name = ncaa4/&gt; The term used to define moving the ball from the defensive to offensive area is to "clear" the ball. Offensive players are responsible for "riding" opponents, in other words attempting to deny the opposition a free "clear" of the ball over the midfield line.&lt;ref name = "Lacrosse rules"/&gt;

If a ball travels outside of the playing area, play is restarted by possession being awarded to the opponents of the team which last touched the ball, unless the ball goes out of bounds due to a shot or a deflected shot. In that case, possession is awarded to the player that is closest to the ball when it leaves the playing area.&lt;ref name = "Lacrosse rules"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ilf rules"/&gt;

=== Penalties ===
For most fouls, the offending player is sent to the [[penalty box]] and his team has to play without him and with one fewer player for a short amount of time. Penalties are classified as either personal fouls or technical fouls.&lt;ref name = ncaa6/&gt;&lt;ref name = ncaa5/&gt; Personal fouls are of a more serious nature and are generally penalised with a 1-minute suspension. Technical fouls are violations of the rules that are not as serious as personal fouls, and are penalised for 30 seconds or a loss of possession. Occasionally a longer penalty may be assessed for more severe infractions. Players penalised for 6 personal fouls must sit out the game.&lt;ref name = "Lacrosse rules"/&gt; The penalised team is said to be playing [[shorthanded|man down defense]] while the other team is on the [[Power play (sporting term)|man up]], or playing "extra man offence."  During a typical game, each team will have three to five extra man offence opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Pietramala, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Personal fouls ====
Personal fouls (PF) include slashing, tripping, illegal body checking, cross checking, [[unsportsmanlike conduct#Field lacrosse|unsportsmanlike conduct]], unnecessary roughness, and equipment violations. While a stick-check (where a player makes contact with the opposition player's stick in order to knock the ball loose) is legal, a slashing violation is called when a player viciously makes contact with an opposing player or his stick. An illegal body check penalty is called for any contact where the ball is further than {{convert|5|yd|m}} from the contact, the check is from behind, above the shoulders or below the knees, or was avoidable after the player has released the ball. Cross checking, where a player uses the shaft of his stick to push the opposition player off balance, is illegal in field lacrosse. Both unsportsmanlike conduct and unnecessary roughness are subject to the officiating crew's discretion, while equipment violations are governed strictly by regulations.&lt;ref name = ncaa5&gt;NCAA Rulebook, Rule 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Technical fouls ====
Technical fouls include holding, interference, pushing, illegal offensive [[Screen (sports)|screening]] (usually referred to as a "moving pick"), "warding off", stalling, and off-sides. A screen, as employed in [[basketball]] strategy, is a blocking move by an offensive player, by standing beside or behind a defender, to free a teammate to shoot, or receive a pass; as in basketball players must remain stationary when screening. Warding off occurs when an offensive player uses his free hand to control the stick of an opposing player.

Offside has a unique implementation in field lacrosse.&lt;ref&gt;Pietramala, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Instituted with rule changes in 1921, it limits the number of players that are allowed on either side of the midfield line.&lt;ref name =Piet14/&gt; Offside occurs when there are fewer than three players on the offensive side of the midfield line or when there are fewer than four players on the defensive half of the midfield line (note: if players are exiting through the special-substitution area, it is not to be determined an offside violation).&lt;ref name = ncaa4&gt;NCAA Rulebook, Rule 4&lt;/ref&gt;

A technical foul requires that the defenceman who fouled a player on the opposing team be placed in the penalty box for 30 seconds. As with a personal foul, until the penalty time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in the penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.

== Domestic competition ==
[[College lacrosse]], a spring sport in the United States, saw its earliest program established by [[New York University]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Pietramala, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The first intercollegiate tournament was held in 1881 featuring four teams: New York University, [[Princeton University]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Harvard University]].

[[File:06177h.jpg|right|thumb|Lacrosse in Australia, about 1930]]
Lacrosse was first witnessed in England, Scotland, Ireland and France in 1867 when a team of Native Americans and Canadians traveled to Europe to showcase the sport. The year after, the [[English Lacrosse Association]] was established.&lt;ref name=piet/&gt; In 1876, [[Queen Victoria]] attended an exhibition game and was impressed, saying, "The game is very pretty to watch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5204528.html|title=Your sport Lacrosse; Think it sounds a bit soft?

In 1985, the [[Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association]] (CUFLA) was established, with twelve universities in the [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] provinces competing in the intercollegiate league. The league plays its season during the autumn. Unlike the NCAA, the CUFLA allows players that are professional box lacrosse players in the [[National Lacrosse League]] to participate, stating that "although stick skills are identical, the game play and rules are different".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cufla.org/page.php?page_id=2314 |title=FAQ's |publisher=Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association |accessdate=2008-11-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519110114/http://www.cufla.org/page.php?page_id=2314 |archivedate=May 19, 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional field lacrosse made its first appearance in 1988 with the formation of the [[American Lacrosse League (1988)|American Lacrosse League]], which folded after five weeks of play.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, pp. 289-290&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, professional field lacrosse resurfaced with the inception of [[Major League Lacrosse]] (MLL),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majorleaguelacrosse.com/aboutmll/history/|title=History|publisher=Major League Lacrosse|accessdate=2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose teams, based in the United States and Canada, play during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majorleaguelacrosse.com/news/?article_id=1282|title=Canadian players thrilled to join Nationals|last=Kelly|first=Morgan|date=March 3, 2009|publisher=Major League Lacrosse|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLL modified its rules from the established field lacrosse rules of international, college, and high school programs. To increase scoring, the league employed a sixty&amp;nbsp;second [[shot clock]], a two&amp;nbsp;point goal for shots taken outside a designated perimeter, and reduced the number of long sticks to three rather than the traditional four. Prior to the [[2009 MLL season]], after eight seasons, the league conformed to traditional field lacrosse rules and allowed a fourth long crosse.&lt;ref name=lsm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidelacrosse.com/page.cfm?pagerid=2&amp;news=fdetail&amp;storyid=192176|title=League announces expansion of rosters to 19 and addition of fourth long crosse for 2009|date=October 22, 2008|publisher=Inside Lacrosse|accessdate=2008-10-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025142442/http://insidelacrosse.com/page.cfm?pagerid=2&amp;amp;news=fdetail&amp;amp;storyid=192176 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majorleaguelacrosse.com/aboutmll/rules/|title=Rules|publisher=Major League Lacrosse|accessdate=2009-03-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223091831/http://www.majorleaguelacrosse.com/aboutmll/rules/|archivedate=2009-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLL has been bolstered by a ten&amp;nbsp;year television contract with [[ESPN]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majorleaguelacrosse.com/news/pressreleases/index.html?article_id=480|title=Major League Lacrosse Signs Multi-Year Agreement With ESPN2|date=March 14, 2007|publisher=Major League Lacrosse|accessdate=2008-11-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103125955/http://majorleaguelacrosse.com/news/pressreleases/index.html?article_id=480|archivedate=January 3, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International competition ==
The [[Federation of International Lacrosse]] (FIL) is the international governing body of [[lacrosse]] and it oversees field, [[women's lacrosse|women's]] and [[box lacrosse]] competitions. In 2008, the ''International Lacrosse Federation'' and the ''International Federation of Women's Lacrosse Associations'' merged to form the FIL.&lt;ref name="FILmerge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laxmagazine.com/sports/s-inter/spec-rel/081308aae.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223144332/http://laxmagazine.com/sports/s-inter/spec-rel/081308aae.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 23, 2009|title=ILF, IFWLA Merge to Form FIL|last=Logue|first=Brian|date=August 13, 2008|work=Lacrosse Magazine|publisher=US Lacrosse|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former ''International Lacrosse Federation'' was founded in 1974 to promote and develop the game of men's lacrosse throughout the world.  The FIL now sponsors the [[World Lacrosse Championship]] and [[Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships]] which are played under field lacrosse rules. It also oversees the [[World Indoor Lacrosse Championship]] played under box lacrosse rules, and the [[Women's Lacrosse World Cup]] and an under-19 championship under women's lacrosse rules.&lt;ref name="FILmerge"/&gt;

There are obstacles to reestablishing lacrosse as an [[Olympic sport]]. One hurdle was resolved in 2008, when the international governing bodies for men's and women's lacrosse merged to form [[Federation of International Lacrosse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uslacrosse.org/news/2005/merger.phtml |title=Historic Meeting Moves IFWLA and ILF Closer Together |publisher=US Lacrosse |accessdate=2009-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907004259/http://www.uslacrosse.org/news/2005/merger.phtml |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another obstacle is insufficient international participation. In order to be considered as an Olympic sport the game must be played on four continents, and with at least a total of 75 countries participating.  According to one [[US Lacrosse]] representative in 2004, "it’ll take 15-20 years for us to get there."&lt;ref name=usint/&gt; For the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]], efforts were made to include lacrosse as an exhibition sport, but these failed.&lt;ref name=usolympics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uslacrosse.org/teamusa06/olympics.phtml|title=Lacrosse on the Olympic Stage|date=September–October 2004 |work=Lacrosse Magazine|publisher=US Lacrosse|accessdate=2008-11-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023081830/http://www.uslacrosse.org/teamusa06/olympics.phtml |archivedate= 2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usint&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uslacrosse.org/the_sport/internatlacrosse.phtml |title=International Lacrosse History |publisher=US Lacrosse |accessdate=2008-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920065753/http://www.uslacrosse.org/the_sport/internatlacrosse.phtml |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About||the children's theatre group|Funbox (theatre group)}}

[[Image:Wuppertal Eulenkopfweg 084.jpg|300px|right|thumb|A funbox with [[Grind rail|rail]].]]
A '''funbox''' is a standard element of a [[skatepark]]. It generally consists of a [[cuboid|box shape]] with a flat top and a [[Inclined plane|ramp]] on two or more sides. A funbox may also include other elements that allow for more complicated [[skateboarding trick]]s.&lt;ref name=skills&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YOi8pxJ08G4C&amp; ''Skateboarding Skills: The Rider's Guide''] by Ben Powell (Firefly Books, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other skatepark features, funboxes are used by [[skateboarding|skateboarders]], [[roller skating|inline-skaters]] and [[BMX|BMX-riders]].

==Features==

'''Table-top''' - The main characteristic of a funbox is the standard [[Table (furniture)|table-top]]; the flat top of the main structural ''box'' component. The table-top can vary in height and surface area.&lt;ref name=skills/&gt;

'''Ramps''' - To allow access to the table-top, a funbox will generally be surrounded (on two or more sides) by ramps or [[stairs]] to allow tricks or transitions on, off or over the table-top.

'''Other elements''' - A funbox may also include a number of other elements including ledges, [[Grind rail|rails]], spines, [[Coping (architecture)|copings]], angled ramps, wall sections to allow "wallrides" and improvised [[street furniture]] pieces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GuVuBmldkIEC&amp; ''Street Skating: Grinds and Grabs''] by Jeff Savage ([[Capstone Publishers|Capstone]], 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

A funbox with ramps on opposite sides may allow for the conduct of [[Aerials (skateboarding)|aerial tricks]]. As such, funboxes are commonly placed in line with the "outlet" of a larger ramp to allow for a build-up of speed. Typically, a funbox with ramps or transitions on all sides of the table will be placed in the middle of a park.

==Construction==

Funboxes are generally constructed of [[concrete]] (as a permanent element in a skatepark) or wood (as a moveable or customizable element for [[street skateboarding]]). Some variations include [[steel]] frames and both concrete and wood constructions will often include steel copings or rails. Some funboxes will be constructed in sections to allow for further customization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DmcMAAAACAAJ&amp; ''Ramp Plans: Learn How to Build Vert Street Mini Launch and Bowls (2000 Edition)''] (High Speed Productions, 1999) [released by [[Thrasher (magazine)|''Thrasher'' magazine]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction must resist dynamic [[structural load]] resulting from aerial tricks or jumps onto the funbox.

{{Spanish name|Ramírez|Ortega}}

'''Guillermo ''"El Pando"'' Ramírez Ortega''' (born 26 March 1978 in [[Livingston, Guatemala]]) is a Guatemalan former soccer player who was suspended for life from any soccer related activities due to his participation in money laundering and fixing games along with fellow national team members [[Yony Flores]] and [[Gustavo Adolfo Cabrera|Gustavo Cabrera]].

Ramírez was also the captain of the [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala national team]].

==Club career==

===Los Angeles Galaxy===
He played the 2005 season on loan for the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] of [[Major League Soccer]]. He struggled, scoring a lone goal during the regular season, but in the playoffs, in his only appearance, as a substitute in the [[MLS Cup]] Final, he scored the game-winner in extra time to give Galaxy its second MLS title. This feat was in high contrast with his poor scoring percentage in the MLS regular season, with 62 shots and 1 goal, which incidentally came from a penalty.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/13/AR2005111300708.html | last =Goff | first = Steven | work=[[The Washington Post]]| title=Galaxy Wins MLS Cup in OT | accessdate = 18 June 2008 | date = 14 November 2005}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramírez is perhaps the most unlikely MLS Cup MVP in league history. He was widely lampooned for his poor shooting and during the ’05 campaign failed to connect on any of his 62 attempts during open play – his only goal came on a penalty kick. Relegated to the bench, Ramírez entered the scoreless Cup final between L.A. and the New England Revolution in 66th minute. In the 107th, with penalty kicks looming, the Guatemalan hit a stunning volley from just outside the penalty area to lift the Galaxy to their second league title.

Ramírez was gone the following season and went on to play in Guatemala and Honduras.

After the 2005 MLS season, Ramírez went back to Municipal, where he remained until 2009, helping the team win four league championships during that period. He then joined [[C.D. Marathón]] in the Honduran 2009–2010 league season and had a respectable tournament; he scored in the final to earn the league championship. The following year, he rejoined Municipal, but then in January 2011 he signed a 6-month contract with [[F.C. Motagua]] where head coach [[Ramón Maradiaga]] wanted him because of the type of player he was under his tenure managing the [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala national team]]. He appeared in the [[2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League Preliminary Round]], scoring the last goal of a 4–0 win for Motagua against his former club Municipal.

===Match fixing allegations and suspension===
Ramírez, 34, along with one-time Real Salt Lake defender [[Gustavo Adolfo Cabrera|Gustavo Cabrera]] and [[Yony Flores]], also a defender, were found guilty by the National Football Federation of Guatemala in September of conspiring to fix a pair of national team exhibitions and a CONCACAF Champions League game between CSD Municipal and Mexico's Santos Laguna.

The trio played together at Municipal in the fall of 2010, when the club finished behind Santos and the Columbus Crew in its first-round group.

Banned from the sport inside their native country, the players saw their exile extended worldwide on Wednesday.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/footballgovernance/news/newsid=1794501/ Three Guatemalan players banned for life] - FIFA&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Ramírez made his debut for [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]] in an April 1997 UNCAF Cup match against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] and has earned 103 caps since.  He has been part of the [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification processes]] for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s of 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014. He captained the squad that reached the final stage of the [[Football World Cup 2006 - North, Central American and Caribbean Qualification Groups|2006 World Cup qualification]]. On 27 May 2012, Ramirez was separated from the Guatemala National Team on basis of suspected " to arrange a match's result of Guatemala against South Africa in 2010 ". On June 2012, this was confirmed by a team mates, Luis Rodriguez and Carlos Ruiz. Currently Ramirez is under FIFA investigation as well as by the Ministerio Publico of Guatemala for treason, money laundering and the investigations are still being made.

'''Hipódromo Chile''' is a [[thoroughbred]] [[race track|horse race track]] in the municipality of [[Independencia (municipality, Chile)|Independencia]], in the  [[Santiago Metropolitan Region]] of [[Chile]]. It is one of two race tracks in [[Greater Santiago]].

== History ==
The track was founded in 1904 by a group of 19 owners, breeders and supporters. It is one of Chile's three main tracks, the others being [[Club Hipico Santiago|Club Hipico de Santiago]] and [[Valparaiso Sporting Club]].

== Physical attributes ==
[[File:Hipódromo Chile.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Racetrack.]]
Hipodromo Chile features a roughly triangular left-handed dirt track of slightly more than 1 mile (exactly 1.645m). Of the three main race tracks in Chile, it is the only one that does not have a turf track.

== Racing ==
Live racing is conducted every Saturday and most Thursdays. As usual for Chile's major tracks, 18 to 20 races on a single raceday are common.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8217">'''Horseback riding simulators''' are intended to allow people to gain the benefits of [[therapeutic horseback riding]] or to gain skill and conditioning for [[equestrianism|equestrian]] activity while diminishing the issues of surrounding cost, availability, and individual comfort level around horses.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Gui-lin|last2=Wang |first2=Shuoyu|last3=Kawata |first3=Koichi |last4=Sinomiya|first4=Yoichi |last5=Ozawa |first5=Takahisa|last6=Ishida|first6=Kenji|last7=Kimura|first7=Techihiko|last8=Tsuchiya |first8=Takeshi |title=Biofeedback Control of Horseback Riding Simulator |journal=International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics|date=November 4, 2002|volume=4|pages=1905–1908|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1175369&amp;tag=1 |doi=10.1109/icmlc.2002.1175369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horseback therapy has been used by many types of therapists (i.e.: physical, occupational, and speech therapists) to advance their physical, mental, emotional, and social skills.

Simulators used for therapeutic purposes can be used anywhere (i.e.: clinic or a patient home), do not take up much space, and can be programmed to achieve the type of therapy desired.  Additionally, difficulty level can be set by the therapist and increased gradually in subsequent sessions to reflect the patient’s progress and abilities.&lt;ref name="Borges"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borges|first1=Maria Beatriz Silva|last2=Werneck|first2=Maria José da Silva|last3=da Silva|first3=Maria de Lourdes|last4=Gandolfi |first4=Lenora|last5=Pratesi|first5= Riccardo|title=Therapeutic effects of a horse riding simulator in children with cerebral palsy|journal=Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria|volume=69|issue=5|pages=799–804|pmid=22042184|date=Oct 2011|doi=10.1590/s0004-282x2011000600014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people use these simulators as personal exercise machines to tone [[Core (anatomy)|core muscles]] in an easy and low-impact manner.&lt;ref name="Kane"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kane|first1=Yukari Iwatani|title=Japanese fitness device makes horse sense|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2006/09/14/Japanese-fitness-device-makes-horse-sense/stories/200609140330|accessdate=9 October 2014|agency=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial products==

Products that attempt to accurately imitate the movement of a real horse and are sometimes used for therapeutic purposes as well as for developing [[equestrianism|equestrian]] skills or conditioning are the [[Equicizer]], an American-developed mechanical product that resembles the body of a horse, imitates the movement of a horse, and can be used at slower speeds for therapeutic and rehabilitation purposes.&lt;ref name=LBlack&gt;{{cite web|last=Black|first=Lori K.|title=Retired Jockey Frankie Lovato, Jr., Is Still Making Racing History With His New Venture|url=http://www.ridemagazine.com/horse/article/retired-jockey-frankie-lovato-jr-still-making-racing-history-his-new-venture|work=Ride!  The Online Horse News Magazine|publisher=Ride Publishing Group|accessdate=2014-01-23|date=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another product that resembles and moves like a real horse is the line of [[Racewood]] Equestrian Simulators, with 13 models to imitate actual movement of horses in various disciplines, including a simple walk and [[trot]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.racewood.com/products-and-services.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022232033/http://www.racewood.com/products-and-services.php |archive-date=2014-10-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulators that do not resemble horses but imitate certain aspects of equine motion are popular in some Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea, in part because land for keeping actual horses is quite limited.  One such commercial product is the Joba,  created in Japan by rehabilitation doctor [[Testuhiko Kimura]] and the [[Matsushita Electric Industrial Company]]. The Joba does not resemble a horse, but rather just looks like a [[saddle]], with plastic handle and [[stirrup]]s, attached to a base that allows it to pitch and roll, exercising core muscles.&lt;ref name="Kane" /&gt; A similar product manufactured in the US is a stool-like device called the iGallop, which was commercially available in the mid 2000s and moves in a side-to-side and circular motion with various speed settings. However, it was criticized for not delivering the results claimed.&lt;ref name="EER"&gt;{{cite web|title=iGallop Review|url=http://www.exercise-equipment-review.com/igallop_review.html|website=Exercise Equipment Review|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Cerebral Palsy ===
There has been increased research regarding use of horseback riding simulators compared to conventional therapy methods.  One 2011 study by Borges et al. compared children with [[cerebral palsy]] and postural issues who received conventional therapy to similar children who received therapy involving a riding simulator.  The results from this study showed that children who received riding simulator therapy exhibited a statistically significant improvement regarding postural control in the sitting position, specifically regarding the maximal displacement in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions.  Parents of these children noted that their children executed activities of daily living that demanded greater mobility and postural control better than before.&lt;ref name="Borges" /&gt;  In a 2014 study by Lee et al., 26 children with cerebral palsy were divided into two groups: a [[hippotherapy]] group and a horseback riding simulator group.  The children in each group underwent the same kind of therapy for the same amount of time using either a real horse or the simulator.  Conventional physical therapy sessions were attended before each hippotherapy or horseback riding simulator session.  It was found that both static and dynamic balance improved for the children in both groups following their 12-week-long programs and there was not a statistically significant difference between the results from the two groups.  This indicates that using a horseback riding simulator can be as effective as hippotherapy for improving balance in children with cerebral palsy.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Chae-Woo|title=The Effects of Hippotherapy and a Horse Riding Simulator on the Balance of Children with Cerebral Palsy|journal=Journal of Physical Therapy Science|date=March 25, 2014|volume=26|issue=3|pages=423–425|pmc=3976017|pmid=24707098|doi=10.1589/jpts.26.423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stroke===
Another area of research involves horseback riding simulation with stroke patients.  Trunk balance and gait were assessed before and after the stroke patients were treated using a horseback riding simulator.  Because stroke patients are not able to keep both feet on the floor and weight distributed equally between them, it is very easy for them to lose trunk muscle strength and control of the trunk on one or both sides. In a 2014 study, 20 non-traumatic, unilateral stroke patients underwent therapy using a horseback riding simulator.  Their therapy included six 30-minute sessions a week for five weeks. The Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) used to assess the patients before and after their therapy showed that they had better trunk control in a seated position following their sessions.  Upon gait analysis, improvements in the areas of velocity, cadence, and stride length of the affected and non-affected sides were all observed.  Additionally, the percentage of time spent in the double support phase was decreased.  More research studies in which more subjects are tested for longer amounts of time are currently being investigated.&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Hyungguen|last2=Her|first2=Jin Gang|last3=Ko|first3=Jooyeon|title=Effect of Horseback Riding Simulation Machine Training on Trunk Balance and Gait of Chronic Stroke Patients|journal=Journal of Physical Therapy Science|date=February 6, 2014|volume=26|issue=1|pages=29–32|pmc=3927036|pmid=24567670|doi=10.1589/jpts.26.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1214">In the [[National Football League]], an '''illegal procedure''' is used to refer to a number of different [[Penalty (American football)|penalties]]. 

== Types of illegal procedure ==
Some penalties are signalled with a generic "illegal procedure" signal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/signals/9]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are: 
*[[False start]]
*[[Illegal formation]]
*Kickoff or safety kick out of bounds
*Player voluntarily going out of bounds and returning to the field of play on a punt

Some examples of similar penalties have their own signals. Examples include: 
*[[Illegal shift]]
*[[Illegal motion]]
*[[Illegal forward pass]]
*Illegal touching of a forward pass
*[[Ineligible receiver downfield]]
*[[Illegal substitution]]

== Usage at different levels ==

It is used similarly to the professional level at the high school level,&lt;ref&gt;http://o.b5z.net/i/u/10039156/f/hs_football_signals_1_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but this term is not referenced at all in the collegiate rule book.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oficiales.org/A_2009/ncaa/NCAAINGLES/2009-10%20NCAA%20Footbal%20Rule%20Book.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Longboarding Downhill.jpg|thumb|Riding a longboard in Los Angeles, CA]]
'''Longboarding''' is the act of riding on a [[Longboard (skateboard)|longboard]]. A longboard varies in shape and size unlike its set counterpart, the [[skateboard]], and has more stability, traction and durability due to larger wheel size and lower wheel [[durometer]]s. Many, but not all longboards, use trucks (axles) that contain different geometric parameters than a skateboard as well.  These factors and their variation have given way to a variety of disciplines, functions and purposes for a longboard. Longboarding also has competitive races down hill where some riders reach speeds exceeding 60 miles per hour. The angles at which some longboards can turn, as well as their ability to coast long distances make them more suitable for cruising and commuting on streets than regular skateboards.
[[File:Longboarding in the snow, East Wenatchee Washington.jpg|thumb|Large grippy wheels and sealed boards often made from weather resistant material like bamboo make longboarding possible in any season, anywhere unlike typical skateboards.]]

==History== 
The life of longboarding started in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="sportsthenandnow.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The History of Longboarding {{!}} Sports Then and Now|url = http://sportsthenandnow.com/2014/02/10/the-history-of-longboarding/|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of longboarding originated from surfers in Hawaii. They wanted to bring their surfing hobby to land when the waves were too small to surf.&lt;ref name="sportsthenandnow.com"/&gt; Surfers then figured out a way of achieving their goal of bringing surfing to land by customizing their skateboards. They would grab a piece of thick [[plywood]] and shape it into a smaller version of a [[surfboard]], then screw the trucks and wheels to the decks and head out to small hills to imitate the same moves they would do if they were out surfing.

During the 1970s, a small group of longboarders honed their techniques.  Some longboarders from this period were profiled in a 1978 SkateBoarder magazine article entitled ''Cult of the Longboard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gillogly|first1=Brian|title=The Cult of the Longboard|date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These pioneers saw longboarding as a form of self-expression, and were influenced by [[surfing]].  However, despite the advent of [[polyurethane]] wheels (referred to as "thane" by longboarders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Longboard Lingo - The Complete Guide to Longboard Slang|url=http://stokedskateboards.com/knowledge-base/longboard-terminology/longboard-slang|website=Stoked Skateboards|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), longboarding did not reach a high degree of prevalence during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=brooke168-9&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooke|first1=Michael|title=The concrete wave : the history of skateboarding|date=2003|publisher=Warwick|location=Toronto, Ont.|isbn=1894020545|pages=168–169|edition=5th printing|chapter=Carving, cruising, and bombing: the story of longboarding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longboarding lived on as an underground sport with home hobbyists continuing to make boards in their garages or strap trucks onto snowboard decks using old Kryptonic wheels from the 1970s or roller skating wheels.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the early 1990s, [[Sector 9]] started mass-producing and selling longboards.&lt;ref name=brooke169-70&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooke|first1=Michael|title=The concrete wave : the history of skateboarding|date=2003|publisher=Warwick|location=Toronto, Ont.|isbn=1894020545|pages=169–170|edition=5th printing|chapter=Carving, cruising, and bombing: the story of longboarding}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s also saw a change in truck technology: reverse kingpins made longboarding more stable.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The Internet has made it possible for small groups of skateboarders to communicate with each other and also gain an audience they might not have had locally, allowing the sport to grow further.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Multiple subbranches of longboarding exist with relatively small but hardcore groups of adherents like slalom, LDP (long distance pushing/pumping), downhill, dance, freeriding, technical hardwheel sliding and more.

Besides diversifying into many "species", longboarding itself has also come back around full circle. It now has begun embracing more street oriented tricks and cross over events using ramps while still embracing its earlier beginnings in slalom, ditch skating, cornering, and just speed itself.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Records==

The land speed record on a longboard was set in 2017, when Peter Connolly reached a speed of 146.73&amp;nbsp;km/h (91.17&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-skateboard-speed-standing |title=Fastest skateboard speed downhill (standing)|date=2017-09-16 |accessdate=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marathon record is held by Paul Kent, who finished the 2011 [[Adrenalina Skateboard Marathon|Adrenalina Skateboard Marathon]] in Hallandale Beach, FL in 1:32:13. The women's record is held by Cami Best who skated a 2:01:07 at the 2011 Adrenalina in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;http://pavedwave.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The record for distance skated in 24 hours is held by Rick Pronk, who skated 313 miles at the 2017 Dutch Ultraskate. The women's record is held by Saskia Tromp, who skated 262 miles, also at the 2017 Dutch Ultraskate.&lt;ref&gt;http://pavedwave.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

A record for the longest distance traveled on a longboard was set by [[David Cornthwaite]] in 2006 when he skated {{convert|3638.26|mi|km}} from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] to [[Brisbane]] across [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ltd|first1=Allied Newspapers|title=British skateboarder sets record across Australia|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20070123/local/british-skateboarder-sets-record-across-australia.28727|accessdate=7 April 2016|work=Times of Malta|date=23 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This record has since been broken by Rob Thomas of New Zealand, who skated {{convert|7555|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Longest journey by skateboard|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-journey-by-skateboard/|website=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Transportation===
The most basic use of a longboard is travel. Commuter designs take many different shapes, including long, wide cruisers as well as shorter hybrid type boards.  Their trucks are designed to be loose to allow for sharper turns. It is useful to have a [[kicktail]] on a commuting longboard in order to corner on sidewalks and to lift the front of the board when riding off [[curbs]].

Also, generally a shorter board, around 24"-35" is used for commuting, as well as medium-sized wheels (65mm-75mm) which help commuters maneuver bumps, cracks and other minor surface obstacles, perfect for students going to class on or off campus. For longer distances, a heavier (or longer) board and larger wheels will maintain the momentum from a push longer, making them ideal in that sense. One problem with this way of travel is that in some places it can be illegal. There have been cases when a longboarder has received a ticket for longboarding in certain areas, because some consider longboarding skateboarding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dehaas|first=Josh|title='But it's not a skateboard': fans say it's eco-friendly, cops say it's risky. The fight over longboarding|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=DA-SORT&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;userGroupName=colosprings&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R28&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=3&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA239530034&amp;&amp;docId=GALE{{!}}A239530034&amp;docType=GALE&amp;role=|work=Article|publisher=Maclean's|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freeride===
Freeriding can involve sliding and other tricks such as early grabs (where one grips the side of the board while on the ground and thrusts upward to become airborne) at medium to high speeds. The decks, which are often symmetrical, may have kicktails on both sides that allow for tech slides. These decks are typically from 36-44&amp;nbsp;inches long and from 8.5-10.5&amp;nbsp;inches wide. Most freeride decks utilize similar construction to downhill boards. Some companies are now trying to produce freeride decks that also do freestyle. They make these hybrid boards by adding kicktails and striving to make the boards out of lighter materials.

===Downhill===
[[File:Bo Peep 2012 19.jpg|thumb|Wet weather freeride downhill on a Landyachtz Evo longboard, Bo Peep hill, UK, 2012]]
Downhill longboarding involves riding down hills as fast as possible and keeping the board under control.  Speeds in excess of 80&amp;nbsp;mph have been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fastest skateboard speed, standing|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/1/fastest-skateboard-speed-standing|website=Guinness Book of World Records|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mischo Erban breaks Guinness World skateboard speed record – Again|url=http://www.longboardism.com/2012/06/mischo-erban-breaks-guinness-world-skateboard-speed-record.html|accessdate=10 August 2014|work=longboardism|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK rider, Pete Connolly, is the current Guinness world record holder, for the fastest man on a longboard, with a staggering top speed of 91.17&amp;nbsp;mph.  These boards are usually 95&amp;ndash;110&amp;nbsp;cm (35&amp;ndash;44&amp;nbsp;inches) long, featuring wheel bases from 28-35 inches, and very stiff to improve control at speed. "Speed wobbles" pose a problem for beginner downhill riders but intermediate and advanced users overcome this by learning to relax and control their muscles.  Downhill decks usually fall into Six categories: topmount, micro drop, drop thru, drop deck, double drop and flush mount.  Topmount boards provide the most traction, but tend to be less forgiving.  Micro Drops lower the ride height slightly, which results in a great all around board.  Drop thru decks consist of mounting the baseplates of the trucks on top of the board with the trucks hanging through a hole.  Like micro drops these tend to be all around boards and were very popular 2009-2011.  Drop Decks get the rider very close to the ground, providing an easy to push and drifty ride.  Double Drop decks are a drop deck with drop thru truck mounts.  These decks were fairly popular in the mid 2000s but have largely fallen out of favor due to their unresponsiveness.  Flush mounts seek to lower the ride height by mounting the trucks in a recessed area on the board.  This minimally lowers ride height but increases the chance for wheel bite (which is where the wheels rub against the board in a turn, usually resulting in a crash). The vast majority of downhill long boards are built from wood.  The three most common woods used are Maple, Baltic Birch and Bamboo.  Maple is less prone to fracturing during construction than Baltic Birch, and as such is used in almost all high end boards.  Other materials used in long board construction are: 1) Carbon fiber with a foam, balsa or hollow core.  2) Aluminum, either pressed or milled.  And 3) Carbon Nano Tubes, although this proved prone to failure and no current company is using this material.

Downhill boards and freeride boards are often used interchangeably.  The main distinguishing factor is that downhill boards are usually directional, with a defined front and rear, while freeride boards are symmetrical front to back.

Downhill longboarders usually use Reverse Kingpin Trucks (RKP), whereas skateboarders use Traditional Kingpin Trucks.  RKP trucks tend to hold traction better and are easier to handle at speed, whereas TKP trucks are more suited for tricks, bowl skating and usually sport a lower ride height.  Other forms of trucks have been seen in downhill but remain on the sidelines.  These would include torsion trucks (seismic) and CAM trucks (Other Planet).  Downhill trucks are separated into two further categories: Cast and Precision.  Cast trucks are the economical choice as well as the most common, although Precision Trucks are becoming more common.  Cast trucks are usually a gravity cast aluminum with a solid steel axle that is non-removable.  Due to the casting process cast trucks have 'slop' which is caused by small gaps in between parts.  This causes small shifts and movements at speed and results in slightly diminished control.  Cast trucks are also prone to warping slightly, causing uneven contact pressure on the wheels.  Precision trucks can counter these limitations at a much higher price tag, although not all brands achieve this equally.  Precision trucks are milled out of Aluminum billet and usually house two separate axles.

The angle and width of trucks also come into play with most falling in the 35°-52° range.  A 45° truck is the center point, providing an equal ratio of lean to turn while also providing the most overall turn.  A higher degree truck initiates a turn faster with less lean, but reduces the overall turn of the system.  This is useful for riders seeking to maximize traction.  A lower angle truck initiates a turn slower with more lean, and this results in less overall turn.  These trucks are useful for making sliding easier, and also for many beginners who are struggling with speed wobble.  The most common widths used are 150-200mm, with 175mm and 180mm being the most common.  Generally a narrower truck increases traction but is less forgiving.  However this is directly related to the width of the board as the truck and the board work together to form a level against the bushing.

===Dancing===

Dancing is a resurgence of old-school tricks in longboarding that involves a variety of walking and spinning moves. Dancing originates from boardwalking in surfing. A board is usually considered a dancing board when it is around 45+&amp;nbsp;inches long and can be up to 12&amp;nbsp;inches wide, and although most of the tricks can be performed on smaller decks, a larger deck provides a more comfortable platform and takes less skill to maneuver.

=== Racing ===

====Downhill====
In downhill longboard racing there are two styles: luge and downhill. Luge is like downhill racing except the rider lays with their back on the board. Most people do downhill racing. In downhill racing the different courses are separated by difficulty. Each race is separated by gender and age. The race sections are Open, Women, Juniors, Masters, and Luge. Each race starts with four riders at the start line. A gun is fired to begin the race. After, the rider goes into a speed tuck. These tucks are used to make the body as aerodynamic as possible. This is done by having the rider lean over and bend their knees with their hands behind their back. The first rider to the bottom wins.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://longboardingnation.com/introduction-into-the-world-of-longboard-racing/|title=Introduction into the World of Longboard Racing|last=|first=|date=|website=Longboarding Nation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Long Distance====

Long distance skateboard racing involves human-powered skating with propulsion from pushing, [[Pump (skateboarding)|pumping]], or both.

[https://theidsa.org/ The International Distance Skateboarding Association] is the governing body for the sport. The most popular forum for racers is [https://www.facebook.com/groups/429473203919081/ Distance Skateboarding Worldwide].

Some notable races include:

* [http://www.dutchdistanceskaters.com/ultraskate/about/ The Dutch Ultraskate]
* [[Adrenalina Skateboard Marathon|The Adrenalina Skateboard Marathon]] in San Diego, California
* [[Broadway Bomb|The Broadway Bomb]] in New York, NY

=== Travel ===
{{main|Long distance pumping}}
[[File:Globe_Front_Clear_Grip_Tape_Bamboo_SIDE.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Globe_Front_Clear_Grip_Tape_Bamboo_SIDE.JPG|thumb|Drop-through longboard deck]]
Longboards can be used for traveling long distances. Long distance skating with charitable fundraising has even emerged (see [[Charitable distance skating]]). Any skateboard can be used for long distance journeys, however, decks designed specifically for long distance trips are typically lower to the ground than regular top mounted longboards. Common ways to lower the decks are in the construction of the boards; drop-through mounting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.windwardboardshop.com/learn/understanding-longboard-decks/|title=Understanding Longboard Decks|author=Tony|date=1 October 2015|website=Windward Boardshop}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows for the whole board to be mounted lower on the trucks and can be combined with a drop-down deck. Drop-down decks are shaped to allow the riders feet to ride lower than where the trucks are mounted. A lower deck increases stability and makes for easy pushing and foot braking.

=== Slalom ===
Slaloming is the act of weaving in and out of a line of obstacles. Riders often compete for the fastest time through the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://longboardguide.wordpress.com/styles/slalom/|title=Longboarding|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pedestrian slalom (usually referred to as civilian slalom because of the alliteration) is a non-competitive form of this discipline in which riders simply swerve around whatever obstacles they find in their path while navigating from point A to B.

=== Electric Longboarding ===
{{see also|Electric skateboard}}
The electric longboard is a variant of the original longboard and a new way of transport. It is essentially a longboard with a motor connected, usually to the rear wheels, and can be used to travel longer distances.

== Riding Techniques ==

=== Sliding (riding) ===
{{See also|Slides (skateboarding)}}
In addition to its role as a braking technique, sliding has evolved into its own discipline within skateboarding, with riders performing various tricks and rotations while sliding. Specific slides include the coleman slide, bert slide, and pendulum. Sliding can be performed on any wheel. Harder wheels (83-86a) will slide less smoothly and break traction easier while softer wheels (70-80a) will be harder to break traction but will lead to a smoother more controllable slide.  Softer wheels, especially (70-75a), tend to wear out faster. Slides can be done standing upright or with one or two hands placed on the road to allow the rider to execute technical slides in any number of positions. When performing hands-down slides, protective slide gloves must be worn. These gloves can be purchased or made at home. They are usually leather gloves with sliding pucks made of hard, low-friction plastics such as [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|UHMWPE]], Corian, or Delrin attached by velcro or glue. Sliding gloves can also be bought online or at local skate shops. Gloves are commonly made by companies such as Sector 9, Vault, Landyachtz, Arbor and Loaded. Slides can also be performed on banks and transitions in a skate park. When a skater slides to a complete stop, it is called a shutdown slide. A drift that reduces the rider's speed without bringing him to a complete stop is called a speed check.  Riders will also do a partial slide called a pre-drift before a corner to trim speed and then hook back up and grip the corner. When the board rotates more than 90 degrees and then returns to its original position over the course of the slide it is called a pendulum. There are myriad more technical and challenging slides that can be done such as laybacks, pressure spins, 5-0 slides, and stand-up rotations. One of the most popular slide and most basic hands-down slide is called the Coleman. Made popular by Cliff Coleman, the Coleman slide is the most popular slide used to come to a complete stop, as the rider does a complete 180 degree turn with one hand on the ground.

=== Carving ===
Carving is an effective way to control speed when traveling downhill.  Instead of coming to a complete stop, the rider makes a continuous "S" path by leaning left and right.  By making many turns speed can be controlled and maintained.

Boards with camber are specifically designed for carving. A camber board is usually made of a flexible wood like bamboo, and the center of the deck will be higher than the mounting point of the trucks creating an arc shape. When weight is applied the center will bend down, creating a reverse of the arc shape. This builds spring tension, that is released at the peak of every complete turn in the "S" pattern.

=== Pumping ===
Pumping a skateboard is a technique used and perfected in slalom skateboarding&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://longboardguide.wordpress.com/styles/slalom/|title=Longboard|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a technique used to maintain speed without the rider taking his or her feet off of the skateboard. The motion itself is somewhat unorthodox and it requires the rider to be very in sync with his or her center of gravity and skateboard. The act of pumping a longboard is the bending of ones knees in the direction of a turn to compensate for the gravitational forces in order to maintain speed. Boards made specifically for pumping usually consist of large longboard wheels which range anywhere from 60mm to 80mm. These wheels are normally soft to promote grip and have rebound urethane to maintain the resilience of the wheel. The trucks on the skateboard are also essential to how it will pump. Bennett Vectors are a very popular pumping truck and when mixed with the right durometer (measure of hardness) bushings experienced boarders can travel long distances without touching a foot to the ground. In a skateboarding world full of kick flips and 900's, pumping had become virtually extinct. Now it is beginning to make a revival with the popularity of alternative transportation and longboard distance skating.

=== Early grabs ===
Early grabbing is a technique of achieving height that originated in old school skateboarding, in which the rider grabs the board and lifts it while initiating a jumping motion. The most common technique of doing this is by placing the right hand (for goofy riders) or left hand (for regular riders) on the backside of the board between the legs, for this tends to be the technique that gives the body the least resistance when jumping/lifting. Although this has become semi-obsolete due to freeriding alternatives with kicktails which have the ability to ollie (ex. Loaded Chubby Unicorn, Omen Sugar, DK penguin), it is commonly practiced on decks that lack tails (ex. Landyachtz 9 two 5, Comet Grease Shark, Earthwing Supermodel) and can be used to navigate the environment more easily (over ledges, off ledges, and off kickers).

=== Cross Step ===
One of the most important core tricks for longboard dancing.  Cross steps involve moving the rider's back foot around the front, flipping the front around the back, and moving into a switched position from the rider's natural stance.  Carve during this trick for extra style by crossing closer to the edge.  Cross steps can be used to change positions with style and flow to the riders cruising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.concretecoast.com/blogs/longboarding/ultimate-guide-to-longboard-dancing|title=Ultimate Guide to Longboard Dancing|website=Concrete Coast|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Land Paddling ===
[[File:Land_Paddling.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Land_Paddling.jpg|thumb|Land paddling.]]
Land Paddling is the use of a long pole or stick while longboarding. The stick is used to propel the longboarder further without pumping. The stick also maintains balance and can be used as a brake. This variation was stated to be an invention by Steve McBride of Kahuna Creations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/vd-land-paddling-is-coming-to-a-bicycle-lane-near-you/|title=Land Paddling is Coming to a Bicycle Lane Near You|last=Goodman|first=Liam|work=Vogue|publisher=Vogue|accessdate=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this method of pushing has been around longer and can't be claimed by a single person.

=== Train ===
A train involves a group of riders riding in a straight line down a hill.  The front rider [[Drafting (aerodynamics)|drafts]] for the following riders, who in turn use their hands to push the front rider through the wind for increased overall speed for the entire group.  This technique requires skill and practice because riders are in such close proximity.
[[File:Maryhill_Fall_Freeride_2012-_spaghettii_corners_3.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maryhill_Fall_Freeride_2012-_spaghettii_corners_3.jpg|thumb|Downhill pack riding at Maryhill, Washington]]

=== Drafting ===
{{main|Drafting (aerodynamics)}}
Drafting is used by downhill riders to increase speed and pass other riders.  It involves riding directly behind another rider to take advantage of the rider in front breaking the wind.  A successful draft can greatly increase speed.  The drafting rider waits until the last second to break from out behind the front rider to maximize the speed gained.

=== Tucks ===

==== American ====
In downhill, an American tuck involves the rider tucking his/her back knee right behind his/her front knee and leaning onto his/her front thigh.  Many find this tuck to be one of the most comfortable to hold while providing for a very flat, aerodynamic back with a small frontal profile.  This tuck results in larger draft pocket behind the rider, which is used in a race to pass.

==== Euro ====
A Euro tuck involves the rider tucking his/her back knee right behind his/her front ankle and leaning onto his/her front thigh.  This tuck gets the rider very low, but many find it to be uncomfortable and it creates a larger frontal profile which creates drag.  It does reduce the draft pocket by guiding the air downwards due to the curved back.

==== Hybrid ====
A Hybrid tuck involves the rider tucking his/her back knee into the middle of his/her front calf.  This tuck provides a balance between the Euro and American, taking some of the advantages and disadvantages of each.

==== Brazilian ====
A Brazilian tuck consists of the rider placing his/her back knee directly onto the board next to or behind the front foot.  This Tuck has largely fallen out of favor for competitive riding.  This is because it creates a very large frontal section that dramatically increases aerodynamic drag.  It's mostly used by beginners or as a resting position for some people during very long runs.

==== Classic ====
A classic Tuck is one that was primarily used in the 1980s and 1990s.  However some modern events, such as the MT Tabor Challenge in Portland Oregon, require this tuck to increase the difficulty on mellow hills.  The tuck involves placing both feet at the front of the board, touching with one foot slightly behind the other.  The rider then crouches down somewhat similar to a modern tuck.  This tuck provides a severely reduced amount of control due to the rider having minimal control over the rear trucks.  Further the stance has higher aerodynamic drag than other tucks.

== Braking Techniques ==

Because of the high speed a longboard can achieve (as fast as a car), being able to brake quickly is extremely important.

=== Run out ===
While not an official braking technique, it is common for riders to jump off the moving board and 'run out' their speed. This is safe only at low speeds. This technique is considered dangerous and is least accepted in the longboarding community. If the rider is traveling faster than the speed at which they can run, other techniques are required, for example footbraking or sliding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sliding (braking) ===
Sliding is the most effective braking technique for downhill skateboarders. Sliding is the method of pushing the edge of the board out so it is traveling sideways rather than forwards, and the wheels are sliding against the ground. The resulting friction slows the board down dramatically.  It allows a skater to reduce his or her speed much quicker than footbraking, but requires a wider area depending on their ability to control the slide. Factors such as the height and length of the board and, crucially, durometer (softness) of the wheels affect how easy this is to do and how fast the rider must be travelling to achieve effective slides. Sliding also requires an efficient and precise use of body weight in order to be fully effective.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Longboarding essentials|url=http://www.tactics.com/info/longboarding|website=Tactics|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foot Braking===
[[File:Longboarding along the Columbia River East Wenatchee Washington.jpg|thumb|Footbraking Technique]]
Foot braking involves putting one foot on the road while balancing on the board with the other foot. The rider needs to put all of their weight on their front foot. This technique can be used to reduce speed or come to a full stop and it is a very helpful technique for an emergency case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skateboardlab.com/how-to-stop-a-longboard/|title=How to stop a Longboard - Skateboard Lab|website=Skateboard Lab|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is helpful in racing or in tight situations where the rider does not feel comfortable sliding, or when a rider only needs to lose a small amount of speed prior to entering a turn. However this method can be wasteful and tends to destroy shoes as the sole of the shoe is worn away and doesn't shed speed nearly as fast as sliding.

==== Frog braking ====
A much less common form of foot braking is frog braking.  This is where the rider grabs rail on both sides of the board and then stomps a foot down while crouched.  This method allows the rider to shed speed much faster than a normal foot brake due the rider being able to apply much greater pressure against the road.  This method still does not slow the rider down as much as a slide and is considered 'odd' by most riders.

==== Sit braking ====
Another variation of foot braking is a sit braking.  This involves the rider going from a standing position to sitting on the board and putting both feet down. This method can slow the rider down very quickly. The downside to this method is that it takes some time to sit down on the board. This is usually used at the end of a run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tactics.com/info/longboarding|title=Longboarding Essentials|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air brake ===
Air braking involves standing upright on the board as tall as possible with arms outstretched to catch as much wind resistance as possible. In racing this is done by standing up from the rider's tuck. This is primarily done in speedboarding to reduce speed before a tight turn. It is not meant to stop the rider, but rather slow the rider to maintain control and stability. The effect is most noticeable at higher speeds and can be enhanced by deploying a [[Sporting-Sails|Sporting-Sail]], jacket or other article of clothing, forming a parachute. 

==Safety==
Longboarding is associated with a different pattern of injuries than skateboarding is. Many longboarding injuries are sustained while going downhill, while very few skateboarding accidents happen while going downhill. In downhill racing the riders are required to wear certain protective gear unlike other uses of the longboard where a helmet and padding may be worn. Full closed helmet, pads on the rider's elbows, knees, and wrist, gloves, slide pucks, and a leather suit are required. This equipment is mandated by the International Downhill Federation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://longboardingnation.com/introduction-into-the-world-of-longboard-racing/|title=Introduction into the World of Longboard Racing|last=|first=|date=|website=Longboarding Nation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longboarding injuries tend to involve head and neck areas more than skateboarding injuries, which are more likely to involve a skater's lower extremities.&lt;ref name=keays&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keays|first1=Glenn|last2=Dumas|first2=Alex|title=Longboard and skateboard injuries|journal=Injury|volume=45|issue=8|pages=1215–1219|doi=10.1016/j.injury.2014.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helmets, padding, and possibly friendly or parental supervision are highly recommended or enforced by law.

Scholars Glenn Keays and Alex Dumas found media reports of five longboard-related deaths in Canada and the United States during 2012, and four in 2013.&lt;ref name="keays" /&gt;  A number of municipalities—most notably [[Vancouver]]—have considered banning or restricting longboarding, expressing concern with the speeds longboarders can reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Should longboarding be banned on public streets?|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/should-longboarding-be-banned-on-public-streets-1.1403855|accessdate=10 August 2014|work=CBC News|date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shepherd|first1=Jeremy|title=Longboarders given a break on North Shore but could face future ban|url=http://www.theprovince.com/travel/2012+Longboarders+given+break+North+Shore+could+face+future/8377377/story.html|accessdate=10 August 2014|work=The Province|date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Concerns Growing Over Longboarding Safety In Dallas|url=http://www.polkio.com/news/2013/jun/24/concerns-growing-over-longboarding-safety-in/|accessdate=10 August 2014|work=Polk County Itemizer-Observer|date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Payne|first1=Sarah|title=Coquitlam aims to ban longboarding|url=http://www.tricitynews.com/news/266667201.html|accessdate=10 August 2014|work=Tri-City News|date=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warnica|first1=Richard|title=Freedom to ride?|journal=Maclean's|date=2 April 2014|volume=125|issue=12|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Meigs County Fairgrounds''' is a [[agricultural show|county fairgrounds]] located north of [[Pomeroy, Ohio|Pomeroy]] in [[Meigs County, Ohio|Meigs County]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]].  Some of the fairgrounds has been designated a [[historic site]], with particular emphasis having been placed on the fairgrounds' [[race track|racetrack]] and its associated [[grandstand]].

The first [[Meigs County, Ohio|Meigs County]] Fair was held in the village of [[Middleport, Ohio|Middleport]] in 1861.  Within nine years, the fair's organizers had bought the land occupied by the current grounds.  The construction dates of some elements of the grounds are unknown, but the present sharply-curved racetrack was finished in 1889 or earlier.  In 1890, donations by average citizens paid for the construction of a grandstand by the track to supplement a nearby hillside where fairgoers had previously sat.  Instead of being placed simply along one side of the track, the grandstand curves around the northeastern turn of the track; it is the only curved grandstand at an Ohio county fairgrounds.&lt;ref name=dohp&gt;Owen, Lorrie K., ed.  ''Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places''.  Vol. 2.  [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan|St. Clair Shores]]: Somerset, 1999, 986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, much of the fairgrounds, including the racetrack and grandstand, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;  Besides the unusual method of construction seen in the grandstand and track, the fairgrounds qualified for its importance in the area's [[social history]] as a reflection of the importance of fairgoing, especially [[harness racing]] at the track, to Meigs County residents.&lt;ref name=dohp /&gt;

'''Ponce de Leon Park''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|n|s|_|d|ə|_|ˈ|l|iː|ən}} {{respell|PONSS|_|də|_|LEE|ən}}; also known as '''Spiller Park''' or '''Spiller Field''' from 1924 to 1932, and "'''Poncey'''" to locals, was the primary home field for the [[minor league baseball]] team called the [[Atlanta Crackers]] for nearly six decades. The Crackers played here in the [[Southern Association]] (1907–1959) and the [[International League]] (1962–64). It was also home of the [[Atlanta Black Crackers]] who captured the second half championship of the Negro American League in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlbpa.com/atlanta_black_crackers.html NLBPA] Atlanta Black Crackers&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballpark was located at 650 [[Ponce de Leon Avenue]]; the street ran along the south side of the park i.e. along its [[First baseman|first base]] side. Behind right and center field, atop the slope bordering the park on the East, were the tracks of the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]], now part of the [[BeltLine]], a trail and future transit ring around the central neighborhoods of Atlanta. Across the street was the [[Ponce de Leon Amusement Park]] until 1926, when the hulking [[Sears Roebuck]] Southeastern Headquarters, now known as [[Ponce City Market]], was built.

The original ballpark on the site opened in 1907. The structure was destroyed by fire in 1923. It was rebuilt in 1924 and was named for club owner Rell J. Spiller. It reverted to its original name in 1933. The seating capacity of the park was about 20,000.

[[Image:Ponce de Leon Park magnolia tree.jpg|thumb|right|Magnolia tree at shopping center]]
The park was known for a [[magnolia tree]] in deep center field. Balls landing in the tree remained in play, until [[Earl Mann]] took over the team in 1947 and had the outfield wall moved in about 50 feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/living/content/living/0403/25tree.html Tree stands as link to city's baseball roots], an April 25, 2003 article from ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]''&lt;/ref&gt; During exhibition games, [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Eddie Mathews]] both hit home runs that became stuck in the distant tree.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

After the Crackers moved to [[Atlanta Stadium]] in 1965, Ponce de Leon Park was demolished in favor of a shopping center (now also demolished) and today a strip mall, Midtown Place, occupies the location. The famous magnolia tree is still standing at the rear of the shopping center along the BeltLine trail.

==College football==
[[College football]] games were also once hosted at Ponce de Leon Park. The [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] played all their home games there from 1908 to 1911. The [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia Bulldogs]] have also played games at 'Poncey.'

==Other events==
On July 1, 1940, the park hosted an exhibition fight&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1006463/2/index.htm Aging Bull - Jack Dempsey's 1940 'comeback' was a sad and mercifully short spectacle], an April 17, 1995 article from ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  between a 45-year-old [[Jack Dempsey]] and wrestler Clarence (Cowboy) Luttrell which Dempsey won.

The park also hosted regular Friday night high school football games between [[Henry W. Grady High School|Tech High]] Smithies and Boys' High Purple Hurricanes during the 1940s which sometimes outdrew the college games.&lt;ref name="gaTrend"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.georgiatrend.com/features-sports-leisure/ray-chaney.shtml | title=The Ultimate Rivalry | work=Georgia Trend | date=July 2006 | accessdate=June 20, 2012 | author=Asher, Gene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1210">'''Rangoon Gymkhana cricket team''' was a scratch [[cricket]] team formed in [[Rangoon]], [[Burma]].  The team played a single [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match in January 1927 at the [[Gymkhana Ground, Rangoon|Gymkhana Ground]] against the touring [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), resulting in a [[The result in cricket|draw]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/12/12170.html Rangoon Gymkhana v Marylebone Cricket Club, 1926/27]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A second scratch eleven was formed to play MCC on the following days at the Burma Athletic Association Ground.&lt;ref&gt;''Cricketer Spring Annual 1927''&lt;/ref&gt; This time the team was styled 'Burma'. Both teams were captained by [[Hubert Ashton]], the [[Cambridge University cricket team|Cambridge University]] and [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] batsman.&lt;ref&gt;''European Cricketers in India'', [[Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians|ACS]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Six men appeared for both Burmese teams. All were European officials. Until 1948 Burma was administered as part of [[India]].

Russia originally earned a silver medal after being defeated by [[Spain at the 2000 Summer Paralympics|Spain]] in the gold medal match. However, Spain were stripped of their gold medal after cheating in the game which lead to Russia gaining a gold medal and [[Poland at the 2000 Summer Paralympics|Poland]] earning the silver.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3008">The '''South African Rugby Football Federation''' was an association formed by the majority of "[[Coloured]]" rugby union clubs that broke away from the South African Coloured Rugby Football Board (SACRFB) in the 1960s to affiliate with the whites-only [[South African Rugby Board]] (SARB).&lt;ref name=Nation&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Black | first1 = David Ross | last2 = Nauright | first2 = John | title = Rugby and the South African Nation | publisher = Manchester University Press | year = 1998 | location = Manchester, UK | accessdate = 2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SACRFB was founded in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/south_africa.html | title = The History of South African Rugby | accessdate = 2011-12-20 | publisher = RugbyFootballHistory.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The split with the SACRFB was driven by a number of factors and people, including [[personality clashes]] between SACRFB rugby officials Cuthbert Loriston and Abdullah Abbass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Magdalinski | first1 = Tara | last2 = Chandler | first2 = Timothy John | title = With God on Their Side: Sport in the Service of Religion | publisher = Routledge | year = 2002 | location = London | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vM_KHo1aiHcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s black, [[coloured]] and Indian sporting codes had come under increased pressure to pursue three divergent paths: form non-racial organisations, affiliate with white associations (where they would continue within their segregated leagues), or refuse to do either. From the 1960s the formation of organisations such as the [[South African Sports Association]] and the [[South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee]] pressurised black sports groupings to move towards non-racial amalgamation.&lt;ref name=Nation /&gt; [[Danie Craven]], then president of SARB, was one of the main driving forces behind the drive to affiliate coloured rugby under the SARB, believing that he could not desegregate rugby unilaterally while all other sporting codes followed the segregation policies set by the [[apartheid]] government.&lt;ref name=Nation /&gt;

Loriston became the first president of the newly constituted SARFF, while the remainder of the SACRFB's clubs formed the SACOS-affiliated [[South African Rugby Union (SACOS)|South African Rugby Union]] under leadership of Abass. SARU promoted non-racial rugby instead of the racially segregated associations that existed under SARB's organisational umbrella.&lt;ref name=Nation /&gt; It should not be confused with the body founded in 1992 that presently governs rugby in South Africa.

The '''Spindrift Stakes''' was an American [[Thoroughbred horse race]] run annually between 1886 and 1909 at [[Sheepshead Bay Race Track]] at [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. A race for three-year-olds, it was contested on dirt over a distance of {{frac|1|1|4}} miles (10 [[furlong]]s) from 1886–1892 and at {{frac|1|1|8}} miles (9 furlongs) from 1893 through 1909.

The race ended with the closure of the Coney Island Jockey Club's racetrack, brought on by the [[New York Legislature|State legislature's]] enactment of the [[Hart-Agnew Law]].

'''Superhero Scramble''' was a superhero themed [[obstacle race]] series that has several levels of races.&lt;ref name="Villepigue2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Villepigue|title=Obstacle Race Training Bible: The #1 Resource to Prepare for and Conquer Any Course!|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dgf0B2D86MUC&amp;pg=PA34|date=4 December 2012|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=978-1-101-59832-0|pages=281–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/amputees-tackle-superhero-scramble-article-1.1403534 "].''New York Daily News'', Rheana Murray, July 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of participants participate for fun, while others compete for team and individual prize money that's available at each event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20120728/ARTICLES/120729604 "Superhero Scramble adds fun to fitness"]. ''Gainesville Sun''.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants frequently dress in costumes based on characters from video games, movies, cartoons, and comic books.  The all-day events included live bands, DJ's, emcees, entertainers, food and beer. There were also night races and kids races.

== History ==

The Superhero Scramble was founded in June, 2011, in Boca Raton, Florida by Sean O'Connor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racked.com/2014/8/21/7580483/tough-mudder-spartan-race-warrior-dash-mudderella-mud-run "The Messy, Rapid Rise of Obstacle Course Racing"]. ''Racked'', Chavie Lieber Aug 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The first event occurred on November 12, 2011 at Quiet Waters Park in Deerfield Beach, and attracted nearly 2000 people. Three more events took place in Florida during the next twelve months, and subsequently the group has organized national leve events across the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chiang|first=Anthony|title=No obstacle too big for father-daughter in Superhero Scramble|date=January 10, 2013|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-01-10/sports/fl-superhero-scramble-woodall-0111-20130110_1_father-daughter-race-andy|publisher=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women participate about equally in the races, and both young and older adults take part.

After 2013, the Superhero Scramble, as well as several other obstacle races, had some financial trouble because fewer people were signing up to participate.&lt;ref name="Beresini2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Erin Beresini|title=Off Course: Inside the Mad, Muddy World of Obstacle Course Racing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLXaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA217|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-544-05552-0|pages=217–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Course ==

Superhero Scramble race courses vary in distance and difficulty from four mile "Charger" courses, to eight mile "Intimidator" courses, as well as thirteen mile (half marathon) "Villain" and the 26 mile (marathon) "Super Villain." Projected finishing times for the events range from 30 minutes to 12 hours, depending on the particular course and fitness level of the racer. Race venues have included ski slopes, state parks, paint ball parks, off-road parks, and more. Any competitor who completes all three race distances within a 12-month period is eligible to receive special designation as a "Superhero Legend."

== Obstacles ==
The Superhero Scramble races include a variety of obstacles including the ''Leap of Faith'' jump, ''The Beast'' climbing wall, the ''Spiderweb'' ropes course, the ''Real'' Barbed Wire, the ''Top of the World'' Container Crossing, the ''Dumpster Divin'' ice bath, the ''Super Slime Slide'' and several mud slides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/25/travel/coolest-themed-runs/ "11 of the world's coolest themed runs"]. By Tamara Hinson, for ''CNN'', February 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.defense.gov/homepagephotos/leadphotoimage.aspx?id=79025 "SUPERHERO SCRAMBLE"]. United States Department of Defense website, Scott Schmidt&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scramble Gamble ===

The ''Scramble Gamble'' allows participants to win a cash prize whereby half the entrance fees are given to charity and the remaining half split between the top 3 finishers.

== Charitable Partnership ==

Superhero Scramble supports Forgotten Soldiers Outreach (FSO),&lt;ref name="FSO"&gt;[http://www.forgottensoldiers.org/ "Forgotten Soldiers Outreach"]&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded in 2003 to send monthly "We Care" packages to U.S. servicemen and servicewomen abroad. To date, FSO has benefited over 250,000 military personnel serving abroad, covering ALL world theaters.

== Night Waves ==

In July, 2012 in Waldo, Fl,&lt;ref name="Waldo"&gt;[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20120728/ARTICLES/120729604?tc=ar "Superhero Scramble Adds Fun to Fitness"] The Gainesville Sun, July 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Superhero Scramble held its first night waves.  Races where participants ran the same course that was set up during the day, navigating by way of the moonlight and their headlamps.&lt;ref name="MRF"&gt;[http://www.mudrunfun.com/reviews/superhero-scramble/ "Superhero Scramble Reviews"] Mud Run Fun&lt;/ref&gt;

== Super Kids Race ==

Kids can run their own version of the Superhero Scramble. The course is estimated to be 1 mile long and with 5 or more obstacles. Age groups of 4-8 and 9-13 run together. Parents are encouraged to run with their children.  Participants receive a medal, a sticker and a temporary tattoo.

'''Unión Magdalena''' ({{IPA-es|uˈnjon maɣðaˈlena}}) commonly known as '''El Unión''', and nicknamed as '''El Ciclón Bananero''' (The Bananaquit Cyclone), is a professional Colombian [[Association football|football club]] based in [[Santa Marta]], [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]], Colombia. Unión Magdalena currently plays in the [[Categoría Primera A]]. They play their home games at the [[Estadio Sierra Nevada|Sierra Nevada Stadium]].

Founded in March 10, 1951 as '''''Deportivo Samarios''''', the club was re-founded as Unión Magdalena in 19 April 1953. The original playing squad was largely composed of Hungarians who were touring Colombia when their club, the [[Hungaria FbC Roma]], was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=El Tiempo|author=Ascencio, Jose Orlando|title=A la tierra del olvido|trans-title=Land of oblivion|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-949409|language=Spanish|date=5 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Unión Magdalena was founded as ''Deportivo Samarios'' on March 10, 1951. The team was founded with the help of José Eduardo Gnecco Correa and Eduardo Dávila Riascos and was formed by the squad of the [[Hungaria FbC Roma]] when it was disbanded after a tour in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=El Tiempo|author=Ascencio, Jose Orlando|title=A la tierra del olvido|trans-title=Land of oblivion|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-949409|language=Spanish|date=5 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first team consisted in 10 Colombians, 8 Hungarians, 2 Yugoslavs, 1 Austrian, 1 Argentine, 1 Italian and 1 Romanian. Deportivo Samarios debuted on league that same year and placed 14th. That season, the team achieved the record of the biggest win in the Colombian league against [[National University of Colombia|Universidad]], with a score of 12–1.

The club was re-founded as Unión Magdalena in 19 April 1953. Unión has only won one championship, in [[1969 Campeonato Profesional|1968]] playing against [[Deportivo Cali]] in the final. The first football club of the [[Caribbean region of Colombia]] to win a football championship in history. Also being first in the Caribbean Region represented the country in the [[1968 Copa Libertadores]]. [[Carlos Valderrama (footballer)|Carlos Valderrama]], one of the most famous Colombian footballers, started his career here.

Relegated in 2005, Unión earned automatic promotion to the [[2019 Categoría Primera A]], after playing 13 years in the second division football league.
 
Red and blue stripes compose the traditional shirt of the team, and its design is inspired by Argentine club [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]].

==Uniform==
[[File:Flag of Magdalena.svg|thumb|flag of the Magdalena department.]]
The club uniform is directly inspired by the colors of the flag of the Magdalena Department since the founding of the team in 1953, although for many years it played with a white uniform. For the 2012 season, his uniform continued with the traditional Barça vertical stripes, and he again used the clothes of the Bogota company ''FSS'' with whom he had signed in past seasons. With the change of the shield, the gray color was added to the vertical and horizontal lines, therefore, the averages of the banana set are of such color.

{{nihongo|'''Yurtec Stadium Sendai'''|ユアテックスタジアム仙台}} is a [[football (soccer)|football]] stadium in the Nanakita Park, Izumi-ku, [[Sendai|Sendai City]], [[Miyagi Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. It was built in 1997 and is home to the [[J. League]] club [[Vegalta Sendai]] and the [[Japan Football League]] club [[Sony Sendai F.C.]]. The stadium was specifically designed for football, and the stands are arranged close to the pitch. For games where the spectator capacity is insufficient, nearby [[Miyagi Stadium]] is occasionally used as a substitute.

==History==
The naming rights for the stadium were sold beginning on March 1, 2006 until February 28, 2009.  In that period, the stadium is officially known as {{Nihongo|''Yurtec STADIUM SENDAI''|ユアテックスタジアム仙台|Yuatekku Sutajiamu Sendai}}.

In 2009, the turf were replaced, and Vegalta played the first half of the season at Miyagi Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kahoku.co.jp/spe/spe106/news_spe/news20080408_001.htm |script-title=ja:仙台―広島戦宮スタが会場 |publisher=河北新報 |date=2008-04-08 |language=Japanese |accessdate=2008-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412061410/http://www.kahoku.co.jp/spe/spe106/news_spe/news20080408_001.htm |archivedate=April 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
