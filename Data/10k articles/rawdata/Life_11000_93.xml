      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2186">'''Adaeus''', or '''Addaeus''' (Greek: Ἀδαῖος or Ἀδδαῖος), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[epigram]]matic poet, a native most probably of [[Macedon]]ia. The epithet Μακεδών is appended to his name before the third epigram in the Vat. MS. (Anth. Gr. vi. 228); and the subjects of the second, eighth, ninth, and tenth epigrams agree with this account of his origin. He lived in the time of [[Alexander the Great]], to whose death he alludes. (Anth. Gr. vii. 240.) His date is further fixed by the mention of [[Potidaea]] in another epigram, as [[Cassander]], who died B.C. 296, changed the name of the city into [[Cassandreia]].  His extant poems are chiefly about country life and hunting.

The fifth epigram (Anth. Gr. vii. 305) is inscribed Αδδαίου Μυτιληναίου, and there was a  [[Mytilene|Mytilenaean]] of this name, who wrote two prose works  Περί αγαλματοποιών (On statue-makers) and Περί Διαθέσεως (On disposition) (Athen. xiii. p.&amp;nbsp;606. A, xi. p.&amp;nbsp;471, F.) The time when he lived cannot be fixed with certainty. [[Johann Jakob Reiske|Reiske]], though on insufficient grounds, believes these two to be the same person. (Anth. Grace, vi. 228, 2589 vii. 51, 238, 240, 305, x. 20 ; Brunck, Anal. ii. p.&amp;nbsp;224 ; Jacobs, xiii. p.&amp;nbsp;831.) [C. P. M.]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0027.html The Ancient Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018153354/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0027.html |date=October 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There was also another Adaeus, a rhetorician, to whom [[Seneca the elder]] frequently refers.

During his interview Ahmed Adil described life in the Uyghur construction camp:
{{quotation|It was a simple life, but there was food and shelter, and company. I'd only been there 45 days when the bombing started. At first I wasn't worried, because it had nothing to do with me. But then it did. The bombs got close.}}

Ahmed Adil told his interviewers that he spent long periods in solitary confinement, in a cell that was only 3 x 6&amp;nbsp;feet, and that he was always chained to the floor during his interrogations.&lt;ref name=McClatchyAhmedAdil/&gt;

'''Albert III, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel''' ({{circa|1250}} &amp;ndash; between 19 November and 4 December 1300) was a Margrave of [[Brandenburg]].  He was a member of the Brandenburg-Salzwedel branch of the [[House of Ascania]], which existed from 1266 to 1317.  He was a son of [[Otto III, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto III]] and his wife, [[Beatrice of Bohemia|Beatrice]] (or {{lang|cs|Božena}}) of Bohemia.

As a son of Otto, he was entitled to use the title of [[Margrave]] and he did sign some official documents, be he was never more than a co-ruler.  The real power was wielded by his cousin [[Otto IV, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal|Otto IV "with the arrow"]].  Albert III administered the [[Stargarder Land|Lordship of Stargard]], which Brandenburg had acquired from Pomerania in 1236.  Albert III was from 1284 the sole ruler of Stargard and [[Lychen]].  After his sons Otto and John died (around 1299), Albert III sold Stargard to his son-in-law [[Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg|Henry II]] of Mecklenburg.  The 1304 [[Treaty of Vietmannsdorf]] confirmed Henry II as Lord a Stargard and enshrined that it was held as a [[fief]] from Brandenburg.

In 1299, a year before his death, he founded the [[Cistercian]] monastery {{lang|la|Coeli Porta}} ("Gate to Heaven") in Lychen.

Albert III died on 3 December 1300 and was initially buried at [[Lehnin Abbey]].  In 1309, his body was transferred to the ''Coeli Porta'' monastery.  It was subsequently lost.

==Marriage and issue==
Albert III married in 1268 to Matilda (d. 1300), a daughter of King [[Christopher I of Denmark]].  They had the following children:

* Otto (before 1276 &amp;ndash; 1299)
* John (d. 1299)
* [[Beatrix of Brandenburg|Beatrix]] (d. 22 September 1314), married Lord [[Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg|Henry II]] of Mecklenburg
* [[Margaret of Brandenburg|Margaret]] (died in 1315, without issue), married:
:# in 1291 to King [[Przemysł II]] of Poland (1257–1296)
:# in 1302 to Duke [[Albert III, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg|Albert III of Saxe-Lauenburg]] (d. 1309), co-ruler of Saxe-Lauenburg

An '''apex predator''', also known as an '''alpha predator''' or '''top predator''', is a [[predator]] at the top of a [[food chain]], with no natural predators.{{efn|[[Zoologist]]s generally exclude [[Parasitism|parasites]] from trophic levels as they are (often much) smaller than their hosts, and individual species with multiple hosts at different life-cycle stages would occupy multiple levels. Otherwise they would often be at the top level, above apex predators.&lt;ref name="Sukhdeo2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sukhdeo | first=Michael VK | title=Where are the parasites in food webs? | journal=Parasites &amp; Vectors | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=5 | issue=1 | year=2012 | doi=10.1186/1756-3305-5-239 | page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=predation&amp;searchmode=none |title=predator |publisher=Online Etymological Dictionary |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701025327/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=predation&amp;searchmode=none |archivedate=2009-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/kqed/oceanadventures/glossary/ |title=apex predator |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722012639/http://www.pbs.org/kqed/oceanadventures/glossary/ |archivedate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apex predators are usually defined in terms of [[trophic dynamics]], meaning that they occupy the highest [[trophic level]]s. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, [[Gray wolf|wolves]] prey mostly upon large [[herbivore]]s (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in [[wildlife management]], [[conservation biology|conservation]] and [[ecotourism]].

Apex predators have a long evolutionary history, dating at least to the [[Cambrian]] period when animals such as ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' dominated the seas.

Humans have for many centuries interacted with apex predators including the [[wolf]], [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] and [[cormorant]]s to hunt game animals, birds, and fish respectively. More recently, [[ecotourism]] such as with the [[tiger shark]] has become popular, and [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] with predators such as the [[lynx]] has been proposed.

Apex [[predator]]s affect prey species' [[population dynamics]] and populations of other predators, both in aquatic and in terrestrial ecosystems. Non-native predatory fish, for instance, have sometimes devastated formerly dominant predators. A lake manipulation study found that when the non-native [[smallmouth bass]] was removed, [[lake trout]], the suppressed native apex predator, diversified its prey selection and increased its [[trophic level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lepak, Jesse M.; Kraft, Clifford E.; Weidel, Brian C. |date=March 2006 |url=http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/cek7/Publications/Lepak_et_al_2006.pdf |title=Rapid food web recovery in response to removal of an introduced apex predator |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911091513/http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/cek7/Publications/Lepak_et_al_2006.pdf |archivedate=11 September 2008 |journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=569–575}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a terrestrial example, the [[badger]], an apex predator, predates on and also competes with the [[hedgehog]], a [[mesopredator]], for food such as insects, small mammals, reptiles, amphibians and ground-nesting bird's eggs.

==Human trophic level==

{{further|Trophic level}}

Ecologists have debated whether [[human]]s are apex predators. Sylvain Bonhommeau and colleagues argued in 2013 that across the global food web, a fractional human trophic level (HTL) can be calculated as the mean trophic level of every species in the human diet, weighted by the proportion which that species forms in the diet. This analysis gives an average HTL of 2.21, varying between 2.04 (for [[Burundi]], with a 96.7% plant-based diet) and 2.57 (for [[Iceland]], with 50% meat and fish, 50% plants). These values are comparable to those of non-apex predators like [[anchovy]] or [[pig]].&lt;ref name="BonhommeauDubroca2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bonhommeau |first1=S. |last2=Dubroca |first2=L. |last3=Le Pape |first3=O. |last4=Barde |first4=J. |last5=Kaplan |first5=D.

Roopnarine criticised Bonhommeau's approach, arguing that humans are apex predators, and that the HTL was based on terrestrial farming where indeed humans have a low trophic level, mainly eating producers (crop plants at level 1) or primary consumers (herbivores at level 2), which as expected places humans at a level slightly above 2. Roopnarine instead calculated the position of humans in two marine ecosystems, a Caribbean coral reef and the [[Benguela current|Benguela]] system near South Africa. In these systems, humans mainly eat predatory fish and have a fractional trophic level of 4.65 and 4.5 respectively, which in Roopnarine's view makes those humans apex predators.{{efn|However, humans had a network trophic level (NTL) of 4.27 in the coral reef system, compared to an NTL of 4.8 for the [[blacktip shark]] in the same system. Therefore, humans were not the topmost apex predator there.&lt;ref name="Roopnarine2014"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Roopnarine2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roopnarine |first1=Peter D. |title=Humans are apex predators |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=111 |issue=9 |year=2014 |pages=E796–E796 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1323645111|pmc=3948303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anomalocaris BW.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Anomalocaris]]'' was an apex predator in the [[Cambrian]] seas.&lt;ref name=Callaway2011/&gt;]]
{{further|Predation#Evolutionary history}}

Apex predators are thought to have existed since at least the [[Cambrian]] period, around 500 million years ago.  Extinct species cannot be directly determined to be apex predators as their behaviour cannot be observed, and clues to ecological relationships, such as bite marks on bones or shells, do not form a complete picture.  However, indirect evidence such as the absence of any discernible predator in an environment is suggestive. ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' was an aquatic apex predator, in the Cambrian. Its mouthparts are clearly predatory, and there were no larger animals in the seas at that time.&lt;ref name=Callaway2011&gt;{{cite journal | last=Callaway | first=Ewen | title=Cambrian super-predators grew large in arms race | journal=Nature | date=2011 | doi=10.1038/news.2011.318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Poa bulbosa, vegetative apomixis.jpg|thumb|right|Vegetative apomixis in ''[[Poa bulbosa]]''; [[bulbil]]s form instead of flowers]]
In [[botany]], '''apomixis''' was defined by [[Hans Winkler]] as replacement of the normal [[sexual reproduction]] by [[asexual reproduction]], without fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/46760#page/313/mode/1up|author=Winkler, H.|year=1908|title=Über Parthenogenesis und Apogamie im Pflanzenreich|volume=2|issue=3|journal=Progressus Rei Botanicae|pages=293–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its etymology is Greek for "away from" + "mixing". This definition notably does not mention [[meiosis]]. Thus "normal [[Plant reproduction#Asexual reproduction|asexual reproduction]]" of plants, such as propagation from cuttings or leaves, has never been considered to be apomixis, but replacement of the seed by a [[plantlet]] or replacement of the flower by [[bulbils]] were categorized as types of apomixis. Apomictically produced offspring are genetically identical to the parent plant.

Some authors included all forms of asexual reproduction within apomixis, but that generalization of the term has since died out.&lt;ref name=Bicknell&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plantcell.org/content/16/suppl_1/S228.full|title=Understanding Apomixis: Recent Advances and Remaining Conundrums|author1=Ross A. Bicknell |author2=Anna M. Koltunow |journal=The Plant Cell|year=2004|volume=16|issue= suppl 1|pages=S228-S245|doi=10.1105/tpc.017921|pmc=2643386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In flowering plants, the term "apomixis" is commonly used in a restricted sense to mean '''agamospermy''', i.e. [[cloning|clonal]] reproduction through seeds. Although agamospermy could theoretically occur in [[gymnosperm]]s, it appears to be absent in that group.&lt;ref name=Bicknell/&gt;

'''Apogamy''' is a related term that has had various meanings over time. In plants with independent [[gametophyte]]s (notably ferns), the term is still used interchangeably with "apomixis", and both refer to the formation of [[sporophyte]]s by [[parthenogenesis]] of gametophyte cells.

'''Male apomixis''' ('''paternal apomixis''') involves replacement of the genetic material of the egg cell by that from the pollen.

==Evolution==
Because apomictic plants are genetically identical from one generation to the next, each lineage has some of the characters of a true [[species]], maintaining distinctions from other apomictic lineages within the same [[genus]], while having much smaller differences than is normal between species of most genera. They are therefore often called [[microspecies]]. In some genera, it is possible to identify and name hundreds or even thousands of microspecies, which may be grouped together as [[species aggregate]]s, typically listed in [[Flora (publication)|flora]]s with the convention "''Genus species'' agg." (such as the [[bramble]], ''Rubus fruticosus'' agg.). In some [[Family (biology)|plant families]], genera with apomixis are quite common, for example in [[Asteraceae]], [[Poaceae]], and [[Rosaceae]]. Examples of apomixis can be found in the genera ''[[Crataegus]]'' (hawthorns), ''[[Amelanchier]]'' (shadbush), ''[[Sorbus]]'' ([[rowan]]s and [[whitebeam]]s), ''[[Rubus]]'' (brambles or blackberries), ''[[Poa]]'' ([[meadow grass]]es),  ''[[Nardus stricta]]'' ([[Matgrass]]), ''Hieracium'' ([[hawkweed]]s) and ''Taraxacum'' ([[dandelion]]s).  Apomixis is reported to occur in about 10% of globally extant [[fern]]s.&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;Hong-Mei Liu, Robert J. Dyer, Zhi-You Guo, Zhen Meng,Jian-Hui Li, and Harald Schneider.  (2012) The Evolutionary Dynamics of Apomixis in Ferns: A Case Study from Polystichoid Ferns.  Journal of Botany Volume 2012 Article ID 510478, 11 pages https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2012/510478&lt;/ref&gt;  Among [[Polystichum|polystichoid]] ferns, apomixis evolved several times independently in three different [[clade]]s.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt;

Although the [[evolution]]ary advantages of [[sexual reproduction]] are lost, apomixis can pass along traits fortuitous for evolutionary fitness. As [[Jens Clausen]] put it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Clausen| first= J.|year=1954|title=Partial apomixis as an equilibrium system|journal=Caryologia|volume=1954, Supplement|pages=469–479}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|470}}&lt;blockquote&gt;The apomicts actually have discovered the effectiveness of mass production long before Mr [[Henry Ford]] applied it to the production of the automobile. ... Facultative apomixis ... does not prevent variation; rather, it multiplies certain varietal products.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Facultative apomixis''' means that apomixis does not always occur, i.e. sexual reproduction can also happen. It appears likely&lt;ref name=Savidan&gt;{{cite journal|author=Savidan, Y.H.|year=2000|title=Apomixis: genetics and breeding|volume=18|journal=Plant Breeding Reviews|pages=13–86|doi=10.1002/9780470650158.ch2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that all apomixis in plants is facultative; in other words, that "obligate apomixis" is an artifact of insufficient observation (missing uncommon sexual reproduction).

==Apogamy and apospory in non-flowering plants==
The gametophytes of [[bryophyte]]s, and less commonly [[fern]]s and [[Lycopodiophyta|lycopods]] can develop a group of cells that grow to look like a sporophyte of the species but with the [[ploidy]] level of the gametophyte, a phenomenon known as apogamy. The sporophytes of plants of these groups may also have the ability to form a plant that looks like a gametophyte but with the ploidy level of the sporophyte, a phenomenon known as apospory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steil, W.N. |year=1939 |title=Apogamy, apospory, and parthenogenesis in the Pteridophytes |journal=The Botanical Review |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=433–453 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02878704 |doi=10.1007/bf02878704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Niklas, K.J. |year=1997 |title=The evolutionary biology of plants |publisher=The University of Chicago press |location=Chicago |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aSrw70rOKgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See also androgenesis and androclinesis described below, a type of male apomixis that occurs in a conifer, ''[[Cupressus dupreziana]]''.

== In flowering plants (angiosperms) ==
Agamospermy, asexual reproduction through seeds, occurs in flowering plants through many different mechanisms&lt;ref name=Savidan/&gt; and a simple [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] classification of the different types is not possible. Consequently, there are almost as many different usages of terminology for apomixis in angiosperms as there are authors on the subject. For English speakers, Maheshwari 1950&lt;ref name=Maheshwari&gt;Maheshwari, P. 1950. An introduction to the embryology of the angiosperms. McGraw-Hill, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; is very influential. German speakers might prefer to consult Rutishauser 1967.&lt;ref name=Rutishauser&gt;Rutishauser, A. 1969. Embryologie und Fortpflanzungsbiologie der Angiospermen: eine Einführung. Springer-Verlag, Wien.&lt;/ref&gt; Some older text books&lt;ref&gt;Fitting, H., et al. 1930. Textbook of botany (Strasburger's textbook of botany, rewritten). Macmillan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of misinformation (that the egg cell in a meiotically unreduced gametophyte can never be fertilized) attempted to reform the terminology to match the term [[parthenogenesis]] as it is used in [[zoology]], and this continues to cause much confusion.

Agamospermy occurs mainly in two forms: In ''gametophytic apomixis'', the [[embryo]] arises from an unfertilized egg cell (i.e. by parthenogenesis) in a [[gametophyte]] that was produced from a cell that did not complete meiosis. In ''adventitious embryony'' (sporophytic apomixis), an embryo is formed directly (not from a gametophyte) from [[nucellus]] or integument tissue (see [[nucellar embryony]]).

=== Types in flowering plants ===
[[File:Agave angustifolia (Caribbean Agave) in Hyderabad W IMG 8660.jpg|thumb|right|Caribbean Agave producing plantlets on the old flower stem.]]
Maheshwari&lt;ref name=Maheshwari/&gt; used the following simple classification of types of apomixis in flowering plants:
*'''Nonrecurrent apomixis''': In this type "the megaspore mother cell undergoes the usual meiotic divisions and a haploid embryo sac &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[megagametophyte]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is formed. The new embryo may then arise either from the egg (haploid parthenogenesis) or from some other cell of the gametophyte (haploid apogamy)." The haploid plants have half as many [[chromosomes]] as the mother plant, and "the process is not repeated from one generation to another" (which is why it is called nonrecurrent). See also '''parthenogenesis''' and '''apogamy''' below.
*'''Recurrent apomixis''', is now more often called '''gametophytic apomixis''': In this type, the megagametophyte has the same number of chromosomes as the mother plant because meiosis was not completed. It generally arises either from an [[archesporium|archesporia]]l cell or from some other part of the [[nucellus]].
*'''Adventive embryony''', also called '''sporophytic apomixis''', '''sporophytic budding''', or [[nucellar embryony]]: Here there may be a megagametophyte in the [[ovule]], but the embryos do not arise from the cells of the gametophyte; they arise from cells of nucellus or the integument. Adventive embryony is important in several species of ''[[Citrus]]'', in ''[[Garcinia]]'', ''[[Euphorbia]] dulcis'', ''[[Mangifera indica]]'' etc.
*'''Vegetative apomixis''': In this type "the flowers are replaced by [[bulbils]] or other vegetative propagules which frequently germinate while still on the plant". Vegetative apomixis is important in ''[[Allium]]'', ''[[Fragaria]]'', ''[[Agave]]'', and some grasses, among others.

====Types of gametophytic apomixis====
Gametophytic apomixis in flowering plants develops in several different ways.&lt;ref name=Nogler&gt;Nogler, G.A. 1984. Gametophytic apomixis. In Embryology of angiosperms. Edited by B.M. Johri. Springer, Berlin, Germany. pp. 475–518.&lt;/ref&gt; A megagametophyte develops with an egg cell within it that develops into an embryo through [[parthenogenesis]]. The central cell of the megagametophyte may require fertilization to form the [[endosperm]], '''pseudogamous gametophytic apomixis''', or in '''autonomous gametophytic apomixis''' fertilization is not required. 
*In '''diplospory''' (also called '''generative apospory'''), the megagametophyte arises from a cell of the [[archesporium]].
* In '''apospory''' (also called '''somatic apospory'''), the megagametophyte arises from some other nucellus cell.

Considerable confusion has resulted because diplospory is often defined to involve the [[megaspore mother cell]] only, but a number of plant families have a multicellular archesporium and the megagametophyte could originate from another archesporium cell.

Diplospory is further subdivided according to how the megagametophyte forms:
* ''[[Allium]] odorum''–''A. nutans'' type. The chromosomes double (endomitosis) and then meiosis proceeds in an unusual way, with the chromosome copies pairing up (rather than the original maternal and paternal copies pairing up).
* ''[[Taraxacum]]'' type: Meiosis I fails to complete, meiosis II creates two cells, one of which degenerates; three mitotic divisions form the megagametophyte.
* ''[[Ixeris]]'' type: Meiosis I fails to complete; three rounds of nuclear division occur without cell-wall formation; wall formation then occurs.
* ''[[Blumea]]''–''[[Elymus (plant)|Elymus]]'' types: A mitotic division is followed by degeneration of one cell; three mitotic divisions form the megagametophyte.
* ''[[Antennaria]]''–''[[Hieracium]]'' types: three mitotic divisions form the megagametophyte.
* ''[[Eragrostis]]''–''[[Panicum]]'' types: Two mitotic division give a 4-nucleate megagametophyte, with cell walls to form either three or four cells.

===Incidence in flowering plants===
Apomixis occurs in at least 33 families of flowering plants, and has evolved multiple times from sexual relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carman, J.G.|year=1997|title=Asynchronous expression of duplicate genes in angiosperms may cause apomixis, bispory, tetraspory, and polyembryony|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=61|issue=1|pages=51–94|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01778.x/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01778.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nygren&gt;{{cite book|author=Nygren, A. |year=1967 |title= Handbuch der Pflanzenphysiologie |chapter= Apomixis in the angiosperms |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin|editor= W. Ruhland |pages= 551–596|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apomictic species or individual plants often have a hybrid origin, and are usually polyploid.&lt;ref name=Nygren/&gt;

In plants with both apomictic and meiotic embryology, the proportion of the different types can differ at different times of year,&lt;ref name=Nogler/&gt; and [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]] can also change the proportion.&lt;ref name=Nogler/&gt; It appears unlikely that there are any truly completely apomictic plants, as low rates of sexual reproduction have been found in several species that were previously thought to be entirely apomictic.&lt;ref name=Nogler/&gt;

The genetic control of apomixis can involve a single genetic change that affects all the major developmental components, formation of the megagametophyte, parthenogenesis of the egg cell, and endosperm development.&lt;ref name=Koltunow&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Koltunow, A.M. |author2=Johnson, S.D. |author3=Bicknell, R.A. |year=2000|title=Apomixis is not developmentally conserved in related, genetically characterized ''Hieracium'' plants of varying ploidy|journal=Sexual Plant Reproduction|volume=12|issue=5|pages=253–266|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/cdjp78mehtf1e6ju/|doi=10.1007/s004970050193}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the timing of the various developmental processes is critical to successful development of an apomictic seed, and the timing can be affected by multiple genetic factors.&lt;ref name=Koltunow/&gt;

== Some related terms ==
* '''Apomeiosis''': "Without meiosis"; usually meaning the production of a meiotically unreduced gametophyte.
* '''Parthenogenesis''': Development of an embryo directly from an egg cell without fertilization is called parthenogenesis. It is of two types:
**'''Haploid parthenogenesis''': Parthenogenesis of a normal [[haploid]] egg (a meiotically reduced egg) into an embryo is termed haploid parthenogenesis. If the mother plant was diploid, then the haploid embryo that results is [[monoploid]], and the plant that grows from the embryo is sterile. If they are not sterile, they are sometimes useful to plant breeders (especially in potato breeding, see [[ploidy#Dihaploidy and polyhaploidy|dihaploidy]]). This type of apomixis has been recorded in ''[[Solanum nigrum]]'', ''[[Lilium]]'' spp., ''[[Orchis maculata]]'', ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'', etc.
**'''Diploid parthenogenesis''': When the megagametophyte develops without completing meiosis, so that the megagametophyte and all cells within it are meiotically unreduced (a.k.a. diploid, but diploid is an ambiguous term), this is called diploid parthenogenesis, and the plant that develops from the embryo will have the same number of chromosomes as the mother plant. Diploid parthenogenesis is a component process of '''gametophytic apomixis''' (see above).
*{{anchor|Androgenesis}} '''Androgenesis''' and '''androclinesis''' are synonyms. These terms are used for two different processes that both have the effect of producing an embryo that has "male inheritance".
:The first process is a natural one. It may also be referred to as '''male apomixis''' or '''paternal apomixis'''. It involves fusion of the male and female gametes and replacement of the female nucleus by the male nucleus. This has been noted as a rare phenomenon in many plants (e.g. ''[[Nicotiana]]'' and ''[[Crepis]]''), and occurs as the regular reproductive method in the Saharan Cypress, ''[[Cupressus dupreziana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Christian Pichot |author2=Benjamin Liens |author3=Juana L.

*'''Apogamy''': Although this term was (before 1908) used for other types of apomixis, and then discarded as too confusing, it is still sometimes used when an embryo develops from a cell of the megagametophyte other than the egg cell. In flowering plants, the cells involved in apogamy would be synergids or antipodal cells.
*'''Addition hybrids''', called '''B&lt;sub&gt;III&lt;/sub&gt; hybrids''' by Rutishauser:&lt;ref name=Rutishauser/&gt; An embryo is formed after a meiotically unreduced egg cell is fertilized. The ploidy level of the embryo is therefore higher than that of the mother plant. This process occurs in some plants that are otherwise apomictic, and may play a significant role in producing tetraploid plants from triploid apomictic mother plants (if they receive pollen from diploids). Because fertilization is involved, this process does not fit the definition of apomixis.
*'''[[Pseudogamy]]''' refers to any reproductive process that requires [[pollination]] but does not involve male inheritance. It is sometimes used in a restrictive sense to refer to types of apomixis in which the [[endosperm]] is fertilized but the [[embryo]] is not.

'''Arthur Charles Betts''' (2 January 1886 – 1967) was an English association footballer. He played as a [[Defender (association football)#Full back|left back]] in the [[Football League]], most notably [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], as well as in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] with [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. In 1911–12, Betts won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] with Derby.

==Career==
Born in [[Scunthorpe]], [[Lincolnshire]], Betts started his career at North Lindsey, before joining nearby Football League club [[Gainsborough Trinity]] in 1905.&lt;ref name=WhosWho/&gt;&lt;ref name=Trinity/&gt; During this time he also represented [[Lincolnshire Football Association|Lincolnshire]] at county representative level. In 1907 Betts moved south, joining [[Hertfordshire]] side [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] of the Southern League, replacing outgoing left back [[Joe Brooks (footballer)|Joe Brooks]]. Averaging over 30 games per season, he stayed at Watford for three seasons, before returning north for brief spells at Gainsborough Trinity and [[Newcastle United]].&lt;ref name=WhosWho/&gt;&lt;ref name=sbs/&gt;

After failing to make Newcastle's first team, Betts transferred to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in October 1911. He featured for Derby regularly, receiving a medal as they won the 1911–12 [[Football League]] [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], and with it a promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. Betts stayed at Derby until 1914, joining [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. Following the First World War, he finished his football career as a player at [[Scunthorpe &amp; Lindsey United]], a player-coach at Normanby Park Steelworks, and a coach at Lysaght Sports.&lt;ref name=WhosWho/&gt;

A '''bad trip''' ('''drug-induced temporary psychosis''' or '''psychedelic crisis''' or '''emergence phenomenon''') is a frightening and unpleasant experience triggered by psychoactive drugs, especially psychedelic drugs such as acid and [[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushrooms]].

The features of a bad trip can range from feelings of mild anxiety and alienation to profoundly disturbing states of abject [[fear|terror]], ultimate entrapment, or complete [[ego death|loss of self-identity]].{{Citation needed|reason=is there research that shows this?|date=November 2016}} Psychedelic specialists in the therapeutic community do not necessarily consider unpleasant experiences as threatening or negative, instead focusing on their potential to greatly benefit the user when properly resolved.{{Citation needed|reason=please provide sources|date=November 2016}} Bad trips can be exacerbated by the inexperience or irresponsibility of the user or the lack of [[Set and setting|proper preparation and environment for the trip]], and are reflective of unresolved psychological tensions triggered during the course of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanislav Grof]], ''LSD Psychotherapy;'' passim&lt;/ref&gt;

It is suggested that, at a minimum, such crises be managed by preventing the individual from harming oneself or others by whatever means necessary up to and including physical restraint, providing the patient with a safe and comfortable space, and supervising the intake until all effects of the drug have completely worn off.{{Citation needed|reason=who suggests this?|date=November 2016}}

==Aspects==
A multitude of reactions can occur during a psychedelic crisis. Some users may experience a general sense of fear, panic or [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name="goodguide"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegooddrugsguide.com/info/bad_trips.htm|title=Avoiding Bad Trips &amp;ndash; Essential Info|accessdate=2006-12-12|publisher=The Good Drugs Guide|year=2006|author=The Good Drugs Guide|work=Essential Info| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061214014751/http://www.thegooddrugsguide.com/info/bad_trips.htm| archivedate= 14 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A user may be overwhelmed with the disconnection many [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|psychedelics]] cause, and fear that they are going [[Insanity|insane]] or will never return to reality. The fear that is felt during a bad trip has a psychotic character, coming as it does from within the mind of the tripper and not from the external environment. For example, during [[Albert Hofmann|Albert Hoffman]]'s first acid trip, he hallucinated that his neighbour had turned into a malignant demon, when in fact she was only a friendly woman trying to help him.

A person having a bad trip might try to harm themselves or others around them.&lt;ref name="erowidfaq"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_crisis_faq.shtml|title=Erowid Psychoactive Vaults &amp;ndash; Psychedelic Crisis FAQ|accessdate=2006-12-12|publisher=Erowid|year=2006|author=Erowid|work=Erowid Psychoactive Vaults|format=shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may experience [[suicidal ideation]], or make full-blown [[Parasuicide|suicide attempt]]s. Because of the magnification of emotions they induce, many [[Psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants|psychedelics]] could possibly cause thoughts of death and intensely adverse reactions in some users. Users can believe that their death is imminent or that the very universe itself is collapsing.&lt;ref name="erowidfaq"/&gt; Rapidly accelerated aging of other people may be experienced, perpetuating the aforementioned fears to an even greater degree.

Some users may experience [[disorientation]]. The normal views of [[time]], [[space]] and [[person]] can be substantially altered, causing fear. Some can worsen their condition by trying to fight the [[psychedelic experience]] after embarkment. There can be illusions of insects crawling over or into one's self, or of being in dirty places such as sewers. Some users may experience a feeling of losing control of their minds due to persistent [[racing thoughts]].

In rare cases an apparent complete loss of control can be observed, with an individual's behavior tending to exhibit a temporary loss of normal understanding of navigation of one's physical environment. An individual in such a state can cause accidental harm to him or herself and to others, and can include behavior such as flailing about or even running into traffic, or, as such a state may not necessarily involve physical movement, may involve induction of a catatonic state or the expression of seemingly random vocalizations i.e. not limited to true speech. This may be caused by a failure to recognize external stimuli for what it is. Stanislav Grof explains this feature:

{{quote|There is a tremendous danger of confusing the inner world with the outer world, so you'll be dealing with your inner realities but at the same time you are not even aware of what's happening, You perceive a sort of distortion of the world out there. So you can end up in a situation where you're weakening the resistances, your conscious is becoming more aware, but you're not really in touch with it properly, you're not really fully experiencing what's there, not seeing it for what it is. You get kind of deluded and caught into this.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lycaeum.org/leda/docs/16869.shtml?ID=16869&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Unpredictability of the experience===
The effects of psychedelics vary widely from one individual to the next, and from one experience to the next. Sometimes individuals under the influence of such drugs do not understand that they have taken a drug and believe that they will never return to their ordinary, sober perception, though some can be reminded verbally. In cases where the individual cannot be kept safe, hospitalization may be useful, though the value of this practice for individuals not mentally ill is disputed by proponents of the investigative or recreational use of psychoactive compounds. [[Psychosis]] is exacerbated in individuals already suffering from this condition.

==Intervention==
Generally, a person experiencing a psychedelic crisis can be helped either to resolve the impasse, to bypass it, or, failing that, to terminate the experience. A person's thoughts before taking or while under the influence of the psychedelic, often greatly influence the trip.

Medical treatment consists of supportive therapy and minimization of external stimuli. In some cases, [[sedation]] is used when necessary to control self-destructive behavior, or when [[hyperthermia]] occurs. [[Diazepam]] is the most frequently used sedative for such treatment, but other [[benzodiazepines]] such as [[lorazepam]] are also effective.  Such sedatives will only decrease fear and anxiety, but will not subdue hallucinations. In severe cases, antipsychotics such as [[haloperidol]] can reduce or stop hallucinations. Haloperidol is effective against drug-induced psychosis caused by LSD and other tryptamines, amphetamines, ketamine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00045391-200007060-00008 |title=Acute Ketamine Intoxication Treated by Haloperidol |year=2000 |last1=Giannini |first1=A. James |last2=Underwood |first2=Ned A. |last3=Condon |first3=Maggie |journal=[[American Journal of Therapeutics]] |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=389–91 |pmid=11304647}}&lt;/ref&gt; and phencyclidine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jcp.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6725621|title=Sage Journals
|last=|first=|date=|website=web.archive.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824075401/http://online.sagepub.com/site/moved?view=long&amp;pmid=6725621|archive-date=2014-08-24|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential causes==
According to [[Timothy Leary]], a crisis can be a result of wrong [[set and setting]].  Leary advised that users of psychedelics be sure that they are comfortable before taking the drugs. Leary claimed that the frequency of difficult trips was highly exaggerated by [[anecdote]]s and fabrications in the popular press.

Alternatively, [[psychiatrist]] [[R. D. Laing]] held that psychedelic crises and other such extreme experiences, drug-induced or not, were not necessarily artificial terrors to be suppressed but rather signs of internal conflict and opportunities for self-healing. The greater the pain and pathos of an experience, the greater the urgency to explore and resolve it, rather than attempt to cover it up or dismiss it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Likewise, [[Stanislav Grof]] suggested that painful and difficult experiences during a trip could be a result of the mind reliving experiences associated with birth, and that experiences of imprisonment, [[eschatological]] terror, or suffering far beyond anything imaginable in a normal state, if seen through to conclusion, often resolve into emotional, intellectual and spiritual breakthroughs. From this perspective, interrupting a bad trip, while initially seen as beneficial, can trap the tripper in unresolved psychological states.  [[Stanislav Grof|Grof]] also suggests that many cathartic experiences within psychedelic states, while not necessarily crises, may be the effects of consciousness entering a perinatal space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=grof|first=stanislav|title=realms of the human unconscious - Observations from LSD research|year=1975|publisher=souvenir press|isbn=0 285 64882 9|pages=95–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Bowen''' (6 December 1897 - 19 December 1960)&lt;ref name="Statistics at swansearfc.co.uk"/&gt; was a Welsh dual-code [[rugby union]], and professional [[rugby league]] footballer of the 1910s and 1920s. He played representative level rugby union (RU) for [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], winning 6 [[cap (sport)|cap]]s, and at club level for [[Swansea RFC|Swansea]], as a [[Rugby union positions#10. Fly-half|fly half]], and club level rugby league (RL) for [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]], as a {{rlp|ce}}.

==Rugby career==
Bowen was first selected to play for Wales during the [[1921 Five Nations Championship]] in a game against Scotland. Under the captaincy of [[Tommy Vile]], Wales lost the match in a match that was nearly abandoned due to crowd problems, when the [[St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground|St Helen]]'s spectators kept pushing onto the pitch.&lt;ref name="Godwin130"&gt;Godwin (1983), pg 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowen was re-selected for the next game of the tournament this time against France in a victory at the [[Cardiff Arms Park]], though he lost his place for the final match in Ireland.

Bowen was reselected to represent his country for the entirety of the [[1922 Five Nations Championship]] in which Wales won the tournament, winning three of the games and drawing against Scotland. Bowen scored two [[try|tries]] during the tournament; the first in the opening Welsh victory over England when Bowen was one of eight different players to score a try for Wales. His second was more important, as it allowed the draw with Scotland snatched by Wales when [[Islwyn Evans]] scored a drop goal in the last two minutes.&lt;ref name="Godwin135"&gt;Godwin (1983), pg 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowen may have been awarded more caps for Wales, but he 'Went North' in 1922, switching codes to professional rugby league, joining Leeds RLFC.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gate (1986). "Gone North - Volume 1". R. E. Gate. {{ISBN|0-9511190-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowen made his début for [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] against [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]] at [[Headingley Stadium#Rugby ground|Headingley]] [[Headingley Rugby Stadium|Rugby Stadium]], [[Leeds]] on Saturday 2 September 1922.&lt;ref name="The Headingley Story - 1890-1955 - Volume One - Rugby"&gt;Dalby, Ken (1955).

A '''bird strike'''—sometimes called '''birdstrike''', '''bird ingestion''' (for an engine), '''bird hit''', or '''bird aircraft strike hazard''' ('''BASH''')—is a [[collision]] between an airborne animal (usually a [[bird]] or [[bat]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spatial analysis of Bird–Aircraft Strike Hazard for Moody Air Force Base aircraft in the state of Georgia.(Report)|journal=Georgia Journal of Science|year=2007|url=http://facstaff.gpc.edu/~jaliff/GAJSci65-4.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107011153/http://facstaff.gpc.edu/~jaliff/GAJSci65-4.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-01-07|format=PDF|volume=65|issue=4|pages=161–169|author1=Gard, Katie|author2=Groszos, Mark S.|author3=Brevik, Eric C.|author4=Lee, Gregory W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a manmade vehicle, especially an [[aircraft]].

Bird strikes are a significant threat to flight safety, and have caused a number of accidents with human casualties.&lt;ref name=sodhi&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Auk|volume=119|issue=3|year=2002|title=Competition in the air: birds versus aircraft.|author=Sodhi, Navjot S.|pages=587–595|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3793/is_200207/ai_n9133434/pg_1|doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[0587:CITABV]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 13,000 bird strikes annually in the US alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dolbeer|first1=Richard A.|last2=et al|title=Wildlife Strikes to Civil Aircraft in the United States, 1990-2015|date=November 2016|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]|page=xii|url=https://wildlife.faa.gov/downloads/Wildlife-Strike-Report-1990-2015.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the number of major accidents involving civil aircraft is quite low and it has been estimated that there is only about 1 accident resulting in human death in one billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) flying hours.&lt;ref name=thorpe&gt;{{cite conference|author=Thorpe, John|year=2003|title=Fatalities and destroyed civil aircraft due to bird strikes, 1912–2002|booktitle=International Bird Strike Committee, IBSC 26 Warsaw|url=http://www.int-birdstrike.org/Warsaw_Papers/IBSC26%20WPSA1.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of bird strikes (65%) cause little damage to the aircraft;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milson, T.P.  |author2=N.

Most accidents occur when a bird (or birds) collides with the windscreen or is sucked into the engines of mechanical aircraft. These cause annual damages that have been estimated at $400 million&lt;ref name=sodhi/&gt; within the United States of America alone and up to $1.2 billion to commercial aircraft worldwide.&lt;ref name=allan/&gt; In addition to property damage, collisions between man-made structures and conveyances and birds is a contributing factor, among many others, to the worldwide decline of many avian species.

The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) reported 65,139 bird strikes for 2011–14, and the [[Federal Aviation Authority]] counted 177,269 wildlife strike reports on civil aircraft between 1990 and 2015, growing 38% in 7 years from 2009 to 2015. Birds accounted for 97%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aviationweek.com/mro/how-bird-strikes-impact-engines |title= How Bird Strikes Impact Engines |date= October 7, 2016 |work= Aviation Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird strikes happen most often during [[takeoff]] or [[landing]], or during low altitude flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Richardson, W. John|title=Serious birdstrike-related accidents to military aircraft of ten countries: preliminary analysis of circumstances|url=http://www.int-birdstrike.org/Vienna_Papers/IBSC22%20WP21.pdf|format=PDF|booktitle =Bird Strike Committee Europe BSCE 22/WP22, Vienna|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, bird strikes have also been reported at high altitudes, some as high as {{convert|6000|to|9000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground. [[Bar-headed goose|Bar-headed geese]] have been seen flying as high as {{convert|10175|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. An aircraft over the [[Ivory Coast]] collided with a [[Rüppell's vulture]] at the altitude of {{convert|11300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the current record avian height.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Alerstam, David A. Christie, Astrid Ulfstrand. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OQjsL97yyhEC&amp;pg=PA276 Bird Migration]'' (1990). Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of bird collisions occur near or on [[airport]]s (90%, according to the [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]) during takeoff, landing and associated phases. According to the FAA wildlife hazard management manual for 2005, less than 8% of strikes occur above {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}} and 61% occur at less than {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The point of impact is usually any forward-facing edge of the vehicle such as a wing leading edge, nose cone, jet engine cowling or engine inlet.

Jet engine ingestion is extremely serious due to the rotation speed of the engine fan and engine design. As the bird strikes a fan blade, that blade can be displaced into another blade and so forth, causing a [[cascading failure]]. Jet engines are particularly vulnerable during the takeoff phase when the engine is turning at a very high speed and the plane is at a low altitude where birds are more commonly found.

The force of the impact on an aircraft depends on the weight of the animal and the speed difference and direction at the impact. The energy of the impact increases with the square of the speed difference. Hence a low-speed impact of a small bird on a car windshield causes relatively little damage. High speed impacts, as with jet aircraft, can cause considerable damage and even [[catastrophic failure]] to the vehicle. The [[energy]] of a {{convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bird moving at a [[relative velocity]] of {{convert|275|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} approximately equals the energy of a {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} weight dropped from a height of {{convert|15|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Note however that the momentum (as distinct from the kinetic energy) of the bird in this example is ''considerably'' less than that of the tonne weight, and therefore the force required to deflect it is also considerably less.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] only 15% of strikes (ICAO 11%) actually result in damage to the aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Bird strikes can damage vehicle components, or injure passengers. [[Herd|Flocks]] of birds are especially dangerous, and can lead to multiple strikes, and damage. Depending on the damage, aircraft at low altitudes or during take off and landing often cannot recover in time.  [[US Airways Flight 1549]] is a classic example of this. The engines on the [[Airbus A320 family#A320|Airbus A320]] used on that flight were torn apart by multiple bird strikes at low altitude. There was no time to make a safe landing at an airport, forcing a [[water landing]] in the [[Hudson River]].

[[Sacramento International Airport]] has had more bird strikes (1,300 collisions between birds and jets between 1990 and 2007, causing an estimated $1.6 million in damage) than any other California airport. Sacramento International Airport has the most bird strikes of any airport in the west and sixth among airports in the US, according to the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], as it is located along the [[Pacific Flyway]], a major bird migration path.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcra.com/news/18489600/detail.html SMF Tops California Airports For Bird Strikes 100 Bird Strikes Reported Annually In Sacramento, Experts Say January 15, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713141753/http://www.kcra.com/news/18489600/detail.html |date=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/378/story/1546906.html Sacramento airport seeks bird-kill law for air safety]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species==
Most bird strikes involve large birds with big populations, particularly [[geese]] and [[gull]]s in the United States. In parts of the US, [[Canada geese]] and migratory [[snow geese]] populations have risen significantly&lt;ref name=BSC-USA/&gt; while feral Canada geese and [[greylag geese]] have increased in parts of Europe, increasing the risk of these large birds to aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Allan |first1 =J.

In terms of frequency, the laboratory most commonly finds [[mourning dove]]s and [[shore lark|horned larks]] involved in the strike.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;

The largest numbers of strikes happen during the spring and fall migrations. Bird strikes above {{convert|500|ft|m}} altitude are about 7 times more common at night than during the day during the bird migration season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Wildlife Management|pages=1345–1350|title=Height Distribution of Birds Recorded by Collisions with Civil Aircraft|author=Dolbeer, RA|doi=10.2193/0022-541x(2006)70[1345:hdobrb]2.0.co;2|volume=70|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=15504&amp;content=PDF|access-date=2018-04-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924004435/https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=15504&amp;content=PDF|archive-date=2017-09-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large land animals, such as deer, can also be a problem to aircraft during takeoff and landing. Between 1990 and 2013, civil aircraft experienced more than 1,000 collisions with deer and 440 with [[coyote]]s.&lt;ref name=BSC-USA/&gt;

An animal hazard reported from [[London Stansted Airport]] in England is [[rabbit]]s: they get run over by ground vehicles and planes, and they pass large amounts of droppings, which attract mice, which attract [[owl]]s, which become another birdstrike hazard.&lt;ref&gt;Television program "[[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]]: the Inside Story", 6 to 7 pm, Sunday 6 March 2011, [[Fiver (TV channel)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countermeasures==
There are three approaches to reduce the effect of bird strikes. The vehicles can be designed to be more ''bird resistant'', the birds can be moved out of the way of the vehicle, or the vehicle can be moved out of the way of the birds.

===Vehicle design===
Most large commercial jet engines include design features that ensure they can shut-down after "ingesting" a bird weighing up to {{convert|1.8|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The engine does not have to survive the ingestion, just be safely shut down. This is a 'stand alone' requirement, ''i.e.'', the engine, not the aircraft, must pass the test. Multiple strikes (from hitting a bird [[Flock (birds)|flock]]) on twin engine jet aircraft are very serious events because they can disable multiple aircraft systems, requiring emergency action to land the aircraft, as in the January 15, 2009 forced ditching of [[US Airways Flight 1549]].

Modern jet aircraft structures must be able to withstand one {{convert|1.8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} collision; the empennage (tail) must withstand one {{convert|3.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bird collision. Cockpit windows on jet aircraft must be able to withstand one {{convert|1.8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bird collision without yielding or [[spalling]].

At first, bird strike testing by manufacturers involved firing a bird carcass from a gas cannon and [[sabot]] system into the tested unit. The carcass was soon replaced with suitable density blocks, often [[gelatin]], to ease testing. Current testing is mainly conducted with [[computer simulation]],&lt;ref&gt;V. Bheemreddy et al., "[http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/1.C031827 Study of Bird Strikes Using Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics and Stochastic Parametric Evaluation]," Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 49, pp. 1513–1520, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; although final testing usually involves some physical experiments (see [[birdstrike simulator]]).

Many jet engine manufacturers include white spirals in the centre of their engines. While on the ground this serves as an indicator to crew that the engine is running, in the air it appears as a white circle which discourages birds from flying into the engine.

Based on US [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] recommendation following the 2009 US Airways Flight 1549, the [[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]] in 2017, followed a year after by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], proposed that engines should sustain a bird strike not only on [[takeoff]] where turbofans are turning at their fastest, but also in [[climb (aeronautics)|climb]] and [[descent (aeronautics)|descent]] when they turn more slowly; new regulations could apply for the [[Boeing New Midsize Airplane|Boeing NMA]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/regulators-propose-new-rule-for-engine-bird-ingestio-450004/ |title= Regulators propose new rule for engine bird ingestion |date= 6 July 2018 |author= Stephen Trimble |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wildlife management===
[[File:B-6543 (7788321152).jpg|thumb|An [[Airbus A330]] of [[China Eastern]] behind a flock of birds at [[London Heathrow]]]]

Though there are many methods available to wildlife managers at airports, no single method will work in all instances and with all species. Wildlife management in the airport environment can be grouped into two broad categories: non-lethal and lethal. Integration of multiple non-lethal methods with lethal methods results in the most effective airfield wildlife management strategy.

====Non-lethal====
Non-lethal management can be further broken down into habitat manipulation, exclusion, visual, auditory, tactile, or chemical repellents, and relocation.

====Habitat manipulation====
One of the primary reasons that wildlife is seen on airports is an abundance of food. Food resources on airports can be either removed or made less desirable. One of the most abundant food resources found on airports is turfgrass. This grass is planted to reduce runoff, control erosion, absorb jet wash, allow passage of emergency vehicles, and to be aesthetically pleasing (DeVault et al. 2013&lt;ref name="L. DeVault, B. F 2013"&gt;T. L. DeVault, B. F. Blackwell, and J. L. Belant, editors. 2013. Wildlife in airport environments: preventing animal–aircraft collisions through science-based management. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;) However, turfgrass is a preferred food source for species of birds that pose serious risk to aircraft, chiefly the Canada goose (Branta canadensis). Turfgrass planted at airports should be a species that geese do not prefer (e.g. [[St. Augustine grass]]) and should be managed in such a way that reduces its attractiveness to other wildlife such as small rodents and raptors (Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010,&lt;ref name="Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010"&gt;Commander, Naval Installations Command, Air Operations Program Director. 2010. Bird/animal aircraft strike hazard (BASH) manual. Department of the Navy. Washington D.C., USA.&lt;/ref&gt; DeVault et al. 2013&lt;ref name="L. DeVault, B. F 2013"/&gt;). It has been recommended that turfgrass be maintained at a height of 7–14 inches through regular mowing and fertilization (U.S. Air Force 2004&lt;ref name="U.S. Air Force 2004"&gt;U.S. Air Force. 2004. Air Force pamphlet 91-212: Bird/wildlife aircraft strike hazard (BASH) management techniques. Washington D.C., USA.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Wetlands are another major attractant of wildlife in the airport environment. They are of particular concern because they attract waterfowl which have a high potential to damage aircraft (Federal Aviation Administration 2013&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Administration. 2013. Wildlife strikes to civil aircraft in the United States: 1990–2012. National Wildlife Strike Database Serial Report Number 19. Washington D.C., USA.&lt;/ref&gt;). With large areas of impervious surfaces, airports must employ methods to collect runoff and reduce its flow velocity. These best management practices often involve temporarily ponding runoff. Short of redesigning existing runoff control systems to include non-accessible water such as subsurface flow wetlands (DeVault et al. 2013&lt;ref name="L. DeVault, B. F 2013"/&gt;), frequent drawdowns and covering of exposed water with floating covers and wire grids should be employed (International Civil Aviation Organization 1991&lt;ref&gt;International Civil Aviation Organization. 1991. Bird control and reduction. Airport services manual, Document 9137-AN/898, Part 3. Montreal, Quebec, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;). The implementation of covers and wire grids must not hinder emergency services.

====Exclusion====
Though excluding birds from the entire airport environment is virtually impossible, it is possible to exclude deer and other mammals that constitute a small percentage of wildlife strikes. Three meter high fences made of chain link or woven wire, with barbed wire outriggers, are the most effective. When used as a perimeter fence, these fences also serve to keep unauthorized persons off of the airport (Seamans 2001&lt;ref name="Seamans, T. W. 2001"&gt;Seamans, T. W., 2001. A review of deer control devices intended for use on airports. Proceedings of the 3rd joint annual meeting. Bird Strike Committee-USA/Canada, 27–30 August 2001, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;). Realistically every fence must have gates. Gates that are left open allow deer and other mammals onto the airport. 4.6 meter long [[cattle guard]]s have been shown to be effective at deterring deer up to 98% of the time (Belant et al. 1998&lt;ref&gt;Belant, J. L., T. W. Seamans, and C. P. Dwyer. 1998. Cattle guards reduce white-tailed deer crossings through fence openings. International Journal of Pest Management 44:247–249.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Hangars with open superstructures often attract birds to nest and roost in. Hangar doors are often left open to increase ventilation especially in the evenings. Birds in hangars are in proximity to the airfield and their droppings are both a health and damage concern. Netting is often deployed across the superstructure of a hangar denying access to the rafters where the birds roost and nest while still allowing the hangar doors to remain open for ventilation and aircraft movements. Strip curtains and door netting may also be used but are subject to improper use (e.g. tying the strips to the side of the door) by the personnel in the hangar. (U.S. Air Force 2004,&lt;ref name="U.S. Air Force 2004"/&gt; Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010&lt;ref name="Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010"/&gt;).

====Visual repellents====
There have been a variety of visual repellent and harassment techniques used in airport wildlife management. They include using birds of prey and dogs, effigies, and lasers. Birds of prey have been used with great effectiveness at landfills where there were large populations of feeding gulls (Cook et al. 2008&lt;ref&gt;Cook, A., S. Rushton, J. Allen, and A. Baxter. 2008. An evaluation of techniques to control problem bird species on landfill sites. Environmental Management 41: 834–843.&lt;/ref&gt;). Dogs have also been used with success as visual deterrents and means of harassment for birds at airfields (DeVault et al. 2013&lt;ref name="L. DeVault, B. F 2013"/&gt;). However airport wildlife managers must consider the risk of knowingly releasing animals in the airport environment. Both birds of prey and dogs must be monitored by a handler when deployed and must be cared for, when not deployed. Airport wildlife managers must consider the economics of these methods (Seamans 2001&lt;ref name="Seamans, T. W. 2001"/&gt;).

Effigies of both predators and conspecifics have been used with success to disperse gulls and vultures. The effigies of conspecifics are often placed in unnatural positions where they can freely move with the wind. Effigies have been found to be the most effective in situations where the nuisance birds have other options (e.g. other forage, loafing, and roosting areas) available. Time to habituation varies. (Seamans et al. 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Seamans, T. W., C. R. Hicks, and J. P. Kenneth. 2007. Dead bird effigies: a nightmare for gulls? Proceedings of the 9th joint annual meeting. Bird Strike Committee-USA/Canada, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; DeVault et al. 2013&lt;ref name="L. DeVault, B. F 2013"/&gt;).

Lasers have been used with success to disperse several species of birds. However, lasers are species specific as certain species will only react to certain wavelengths. Lasers become more effective as ambient light levels decrease, thereby limiting effectiveness during daylight hours. Some species show a very short time to habituation (Airport Cooperative Research Program, 2011&lt;ref name="Airport Cooperative Research Program 2011"&gt;Airport Cooperative Research Program. 2011. Bird harassment, repellent, and deterrent techniques for use on and near airports. Transportation Research Board. Washington D.C., USA.&lt;/ref&gt;). The risks of lasers to aircrews must be evaluated when determining whether or not to deploy lasers on airfields.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/7400.2L_Bsc_w_Chg1_dtd_10-12-17.pdf FAA Order JO 7400.2L, Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters], effective 2017-10-12 (with changes), accessed 2017-12-04&lt;/ref&gt; Southampton Airport utilises a laser device which disables the laser past a certain [[Elevation (astronomy)|elevation]], eliminating the risk of the beam being shone directly at aircraft and air traffic control tower (Southampton Airport 2014&lt;ref&gt;Southampton Airport. 2014. Southampton Airport brings in next generation of bird control lasers. &lt; http://www.southamptonairport.com/news/news-press/2014/07/09/southampton-airport-brings-in-next-generation-of-bird-control-lasers/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014114517/http://www.southamptonairport.com/news/news-press/2014/07/09/southampton-airport-brings-in-next-generation-of-bird-control-lasers/ |date=2016-10-14 }}&gt;. Accessed 11 Oct 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;).

====Auditory repellents====
Auditory repellents are commonly used in both agricultural and aviation contexts. Devices such as propane exploders (cannons), pyrotechnics, and bioacoustics are frequently deployed on airports. Propane exploders are capable of creating noises of approximately 130 decibels (Wildlife Control Supplies&lt;ref&gt;Wildlife Control Supplies. 2013. M4 Single Bang Propane Cannon. &lt; http://www.wildlifecontrolsupplies.com/animal/NWS2501/WCSRJM4.html&gt;. Accessed 26 Oct 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;). They can be programmed to fire at designated intervals, can be remote controlled, or motion activated. Due to their stationary and often predictable nature, wildlife quickly become habituated to propane cannons. Lethal control may be used to extend the effectiveness of propane exploders (Washburn et al. 2006).

Pyrotechnics utilizing either an exploding shell or a screamer can effectively scare birds away from runways. They are commonly launched from a 12 gauge shotgun or a flare pistol, or from a wireless specialized launcher and as such, can be aimed allowing control personnel to "steer" the species that is being harassed. Birds show varying degrees of habituation to pyrotechnics. Studies have shown that lethal reinforcement of pyrotechnic harassment has extended its usefulness (Baxter and Allen 2008&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, A. T., and J. R. Allan, 2008. Use of lethal control to reduce habituation to blank rounds by scavenging birds. Journal of Wildlifie Management 72:1653–1657.&lt;/ref&gt;). Screamer type cartridges are still intact at the end of their flight (as opposed to exploding shells that destroy themselves) constituting a foreign object damage hazard and must be picked up. The use of pyrotechnics is considered "take" by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and USFWS must be consulted if federally threatened or endangered species could be affected. Pyrotechnics are a potential fire hazard and must be deployed judiciously in dry conditions (Commander, Naval Installations Command, 2010,&lt;ref name="Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010"/&gt; Airport Cooperative Research Program 2011&lt;ref name="Airport Cooperative Research Program 2011"/&gt;).

Bioacoustics, or the playing of conspecific distress or predator calls to frighten animals, is widely used. This method relies on the animal's evolutionary danger response (Airport Cooperative Research Program 2011&lt;ref name="Airport Cooperative Research Program 2011"/&gt;).However, bioacoustics are species specific and birds may quickly become habituated to them and they should not be used as a primary means of control (U.S. Air Force 2004,&lt;ref name="U.S. Air Force 2004"/&gt; Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010&lt;ref name="Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010"/&gt;).

====Tactile repellents====
Sharpened spikes to deter perching and loafing are commonly used. Generally, large birds require different applications than small birds do (DeVault et al. 2013&lt;ref name="L. DeVault, B. F 2013"/&gt;).

====Chemical repellents====
There are only two chemical bird repellents registered for use in the United States. They are [[methyl anthranilate]] and [[anthraquinone]]. Methyl anthranilate is a primary repellent that produces an immediate unpleasant sensation that is reflexive and does not have to be learned. As such it is most effective for transient populations of birds (DeVault et al. 2013&lt;ref name="L. DeVault, B. F 2013"/&gt;). Methyl anthranilate has been used with great success at rapidly dispersing birds from flightlines at Homestead Air Reserve Station (Engeman et al. 2002&lt;ref&gt;Engeman, R. M., J. Peterla, and B. Constantin. 2002. Methyl anthranilate aerosol for dispersing birds from the flight lines at Homestead Air Reserve Station. USDA National Wildlife Research Center-Staff Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;). Anthraquinone is a secondary repellent that has a laxative effect that is not instantaneous. Because of this it is most effective on resident populations of wildlife that will have time to learn an aversive response (Izhaki 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Izhaki | first1 = I. | year = 2002 | title = Emodin – a secondary metabolite with multiple ecological functions in higher plants | url = | journal = New Phytologist | volume = 155 | issue = | pages = 205–217 | doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00459.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeVault et al. 2013&lt;ref name="L. DeVault, B. F 2013"/&gt;).

====Relocation====
Relocation of raptors from airports is often considered preferable to lethal control methods by both biologists and the public. There are complex legal issues surrounding the capture and relocation of species protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940. Prior to capture, proper permits must be obtained and the high mortality rates as well as the risk of disease transmission associated with relocation must be weighed. Between 2008 and 2010, U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services personnel relocated 606 red-tailed hawks from airports in the United States after the failure of multiple harassment attempts. The return rate of these hawks was 6%; however the relocation mortality rate for these hawks was never determined (DeVault et al. 2013&lt;ref name="L. DeVault, B. F 2013"/&gt;).

====Lethal====
Lethal wildlife control on airports falls into two categories: reinforcement of other non-lethal methods and population control.

====Reinforcement====
The premise of effigies, pyrotechnics, and propane exploders is that there be a perceived immediate danger to the species to be dispersed. Initially, the sight of an unnaturally positioned effigy or the sound of pyrotechnics or exploders is enough to elicit a danger response from wildlife. As wildlife become habituated to non-lethal methods the culling of small numbers of wildlife in the presence of conspecifics can restore the danger response (Baxter and Allan 2008, Cook et al. 2008, Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010,&lt;ref name="Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010"/&gt; DeVault et al. 2013&lt;ref name="L. DeVault, B. F 2013"/&gt;).

====Population control====
Under certain circumstances lethal wildlife control is needed to control the population of a species. This control can be localized or regional. Localized population control is often used to control species that are residents of the airfield such as deer that have bypassed the perimeter fence. In this instance sharpshooting would be highly effective, such as is seen at Chicago O'Hare International Airport (DeVault et al. 2013&lt;ref name="L. DeVault, B. F 2013"/&gt;).
 
Regional population control has been used on species that cannot be excluded from the airport environment. A nesting colony of laughing gulls at Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge contributed to 98–315 bird strikes per year, in 1979–1992, at adjacent John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). Though JFK had an active bird management program that precluded birds from feeding and loafing on the airport, it did not stop them from overflying the airport to other feeding sites. U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services personnel began shooting all gulls that flew over the airport, hypothesizing that eventually the gulls would alter their flight patterns. They shot 28,352 gulls in two years (approximately half of the population at Jamaica Bay and 5–6% of the nationwide population per year). Strikes with laughing gulls decreased by 89% by 1992. However this was more a function of the population reduction than the gulls altering their flight pattern (Dolbeer et al. 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dolbeer | first1 = R. A. | last2 = Belant | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Sillings | first3 = J. | year = 1993 | title = Shooting gulls reduces strikes with aircraft at John F. Kennedy International Airport | url = | journal = Wildlife Society Bulletin | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 442–450 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolbeer et al. 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Dolbeer, R. A., R. B. Chipman, A. L. Gosser, and S. C. Barras. 2003. Does shooting alter flight patterns of gulls: a case study at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Proceedings of the International Bird Strike Committee 26:49–67.&lt;/ref&gt; DeVault et al. 2013&lt;ref name="L. DeVault, B. F 2013"/&gt;).

===Flight path===
Pilots should not take off or land in the presence of wildlife and should avoid migratory routes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/civilaviation/AerodromeAirNav/Standards/WildlifeControl/AIPHazards.htm |title=AIP Bird Hazards |publisher=Transport Canada |accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; wildlife reserves, estuaries and other sites where birds may congregate. When operating in the presence of bird flocks, pilots should seek to climb above {{convert|3000|ft|m}} as rapidly as possible as most birdstrikes occur below {{convert|3000|ft|m}}. Additionally, pilots should slow down their aircraft when confronted with birds. The energy that must be dissipated in the collision is approximately the relative [[kinetic energy]] (&lt;math&gt;E_{k}&lt;/math&gt;) of the bird, defined by the equation &lt;math&gt;E_{k} = \frac{1}{2} m v^{2}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the bird and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the relative velocity (the difference of the velocities of the bird and the plane, resulting in a lower absolute value if they are flying in the same direction and higher absolute value if they are flying in opposite directions). Therefore, the speed of the aircraft is much more important than the size of the bird when it comes to reducing energy transfer in a collision. The same can be said for jet engines: the slower the rotation of the engine, the less energy which will be imparted onto the engine at collision.

The body density of the bird is also a parameter that influences the amount of damage caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Determination of body density for twelve bird species|journal= Ibis|volume=137|issue=3|pages=424–428|year= 1995|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1995.tb08046.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Military Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) uses near real time data from the 148 CONUS based National Weather Service Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD or WSR 88-D) system to provide current bird hazard conditions for published military low-level routes, ranges, and military operating areas (MOAs). Additionally AHAS incorporates weather forecast data with the Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) to predict soaring bird activity within the next 24 hours and then defaults to the BAM for planning purposes when activity is scheduled outside the 24-hour window. The BAM is a static historical hazard model based on many years of bird distribution data from Christmas Bird Counts (CBC), Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS), and National Wildlife Refuge Data. The BAM also incorporates potentially hazardous bird attractions such as landfills and golf courses. AHAS is now an integral part of military low-level mission planning, aircrew being able to access the current bird hazard conditions at [[www.usahas.com]]. AHAS will provide relative risk assessments for the planned mission and give aircrew the opportunity to select a less hazardous route should the planned route be rated severe or moderate. Prior to 2003, the US Air Force BASH Team bird strike database indicated that approximately 25% of all strikes were associated with low-level routes and bombing ranges. More importantly these strikes accounted for more than 50% of all of the reported damage costs. After a decade of using AHAS for avoiding routes with severe ratings, the strike percentage associated with low-level flight operations has been reduced to 12% and associated costs cut in half.

Properly designed and equipped avian radars can track thousands of birds simultaneously in real-time, night and day, through 360° of coverage, out to ranges of 10&amp;nbsp;km and beyond for flocks, updating every target's position (longitude, latitude, altitude), speed, heading, and size every 2–3 seconds. Data from these systems can be used to generate information products ranging from real-time threat alerts to historical analyses of bird activity patterns in both time and space. The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the United States Department of Defense (DOD) have conducted extensive science-based field testing and validation of commercial avian radar systems for civil and military applications, respectively. The FAA used evaluations of commercial 3D avian radar systems developed and marketed by Accipiter Radar&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accipiterradar.com/page/bird-strike-prevention "Accipiter Radar: Bird Strike Prevention Applications"]&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis for FAA Advisory Circular 150/5220-25&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/airports/resources/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.current/documentNumber/150_5220-25 "Airport Avian Radar Systems"]&lt;/ref&gt; and a guidance letter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accipiterradar.com/media/pdf/20120305_Aip_Avian_Radars.pdf "Program Guidance Letter 12-04"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233545/http://www.accipiterradar.com/media/pdf/20120305_Aip_Avian_Radars.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on using Airport Improvement Program funds to acquire avian radar systems at Part 139 airports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/part139_cert/ "Part 139 Airport Certification"]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the DOD-sponsored Integration and Validation of Avian Radars (IVAR)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.serdp-estcp.org/Program-Areas/Resource-Conservation-and-Climate-Change/Natural-Resources/Species-Ecology-and-Management/RC-200723/RC-200723/%28language%29/eng-US "Validation and Integration of Networked Avian Radars: RC-200723"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092206/https://www.serdp-estcp.org/Program-Areas/Resource-Conservation-and-Climate-Change/Natural-Resources/Species-Ecology-and-Management/RC-200723/RC-200723/%28language%29/eng-US |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; project evaluated the functional and performance characteristics of Accipiter® avian radars under operational conditions at Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force airfields.

A US company, DeTect, in 2003, developed the only production model bird radar in operational use for real-time, tactical bird–aircraft strike avoidance by air traffic controllers. These systems are operational at both commercial airports and military airfields. The system has widely used technology available for bird–aircraft strike hazard (BASH) management and for real time detection, tracking and alerting of hazardous bird activity at commercial airports, military airfields and military training and bombing ranges. After extensive evaluation and on-site testing, MERLIN technology was chosen by NASA and was ultimately used for detecting and tracking dangerous vulture activity during the 22 space shuttle launches from 2006 to the conclusion of the program in 2011. The US Air Force has contracted DeTect since 2003 to provide the Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS)previously mentioned.

[[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]], a Dutch R&amp;D Institute, has developed the successful ROBIN (Radar Observation of Bird Intensity) for the Royal Netherlands Airforce. ROBIN is a near real-time monitoring system for flight movements of birds. ROBIN identifies flocks of birds within the signals of large radar systems. This information is used to give Air Force pilots warning during landing and take-off. Years of observation of bird migration with ROBIN have also provided a better insight into bird migration behaviour, which has had an influence on averting collisions with birds, and therefore on flight safety. Since the implementation of the ROBIN system at the Royal Netherlands Airforce the number of collisions between birds and aircraft in the vicinity of military airbases has decreased by more than 50%.

There are no civil aviation counterparts to the above military strategies. Some experimentation with small portable radar units has taken place at some airports. However, no standard has been adopted for radar warning nor has any governmental policy regarding warnings been implemented.

The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) estimates bird strikes cost US aviation 400 million [[United States dollar|dollars]] annually and have resulted in over 200 worldwide deaths since 1988.&lt;ref name=BSC-USA2&gt;{{cite web|author= John Ostrom |url=http://www.birdstrike.org/ |title=Bird Strike Committee USA statistics on birdstrikes |accessdate=2009-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the Central Science Laboratory estimates&lt;ref name=allan&gt;{{cite web|author=Allan, John R. |author2=Alex P.

This cost includes direct repair cost and lost revenue opportunities while the damaged aircraft is out of service. Estimating that 80% of bird strikes are unreported, there were 4,300 bird strikes listed by the [[United States Air Force]] and 5,900 by US civil aircraft in 2003.

The first reported bird strike was by [[Wright brothers|Orville Wright]] in 1905. According to the Wright Brothers' diaries, "Orville … flew 4,751 meters in 4 minutes 45 seconds, four complete circles. Twice passed over fence into Beard's cornfield. Chased flock of birds for two rounds and killed one which fell on top of the upper surface and after a time fell off when swinging a sharp curve."&lt;ref name="thorpe"/&gt;

During the [[1911 Paris to Madrid air race]], French pilot [[Eugene Gilbert]] encountered an angry mother eagle over the [[Pyrenees]]. Gilbert, flying an open-cockpit [[Bleriot XI]], was able to ward off the large bird by firing pistol shots at it but did not kill it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pathfinders'' c.1980 by David Nevin for Time-Life books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=domenica&gt;La Domenica del Corriere, [[:File:Domenica del Corriere eagle attack.png|cover painting depicting Gilbert's encounter with an eagle]], 4 July 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded bird strike fatality was reported in 1912 when aero-pioneer [[Cal Rodgers]] collided with a gull which became jammed in his aircraft control cables. He crashed at [[Long Beach, California]], was pinned under the wreckage, and drowned.&lt;ref name=sodhi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=375|title=Wilbur and Orville: A Biography of the Wright Brothers|author=Howard, Fred|publisher=Courier Dover|year=1998|isbn=0-486-40297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest loss of life directly linked to a bird strike was on October 4, 1960, when a [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]], flying from Boston as [[Eastern Air Lines Flight 375]], flew through a flock of [[common starling]]s during take-off, damaging all four engines.

NASA astronaut [[Theodore Freeman]] was killed in 1964 when a goose shattered the plexiglass cockpit canopy of his [[Northrop T-38 Talon]]. Shards were ingested by the engines, leading to a fatal crash.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 1988 [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 604]] sucked [[Columbidae|pigeons]] into both engines during takeoff and then crashed, killing 35 passengers.

In 1995, a [[Dassault Falcon 20]] crashed at a [[Paris]] airport during an emergency landing attempt after sucking [[lapwing]]s into an engine, which caused an engine failure and a fire in the airplane's [[fuselage]]; all 10 people on board were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp13549-chapter1-2366.htm Transport Canada – Wildlife-strike Costs and Legal Liability]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 1995, a U.S. Air Force [[Boeing E-3 Sentry]] AWACS aircraft (Callsign Yukla 27, serial number 77-0354), [[1995 Alaska Boeing E-3 Sentry accident|crashed]] shortly after takeoff from [[Elmendorf AFB]]. The aircraft lost power in both port side engines after these engines ingested several [[Canada geese]] during takeoff. It crashed about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} from the runway, killing all 24 crew members on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/investigation/cvr/transcripts/cvr_yukla27.php|title=CVR transcript Boeing E-3 USAF Yukla 27 – 22 SEP 1995 |work=Accident investigation |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |date=22 September 1995 |accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, 2004, the nose landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]], struck a bird during takeoff at [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]]. The incident was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at [[Barcelona International Airport]], the aircraft started deviating to the left of the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the nose wheel steering tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The nose landing gear leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the nose wheel steering system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application of grease during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{ASN accident|id=20041128-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, a Thomsonfly [[Boeing 757]] from [[Manchester Airport]] to [[Lanzarote Airport]] suffered a bird strike when at least one bird, supposedly a crow, was ingested by the starboard engine. The plane landed safely back at Manchester Airport a while later. The incident was captured by two [[plane spotter]]s on opposite sides of the airport, as well as the emergency calls picked up by a plane spotter's radio.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

The [[Space Shuttle Discovery]] also hit a bird (a vulture) during the launch of [[STS-114]] on July 26, 2005, although the collision occurred soon after lift-off and at low speed, with no obvious damage to the shuttle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Young, Kelly|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blog/shortsharpscience/2006/04/space-vulture-squadron.html|date=2006-04-28|title=The Space Vulture Squadron|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2008, [[Ryanair Flight 4102]] from Frankfurt to Rome made an [[emergency landing]] at [[Ciampino Airport]] after multiple bird strikes caused both engines to fail. After touchdown, the left main [[landing gear]] collapsed, and the aircraft briefly veered off the runway.

On January 4, 2009, a [[Sikorsky S-76]] helicopter hit a [[red-tailed hawk]] in Louisiana. The hawk hit the helicopter just above the windscreen. The impact forced the activation of the engine fire suppression control handles, retarding the throttles and causing the engines to lose power. Eight of the nine persons on board died in the subsequent crash; the survivor, a passenger, was seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/aviation/AccidentReports/huslbw55zsht4kfzewb1qu551/T05022012120000.pdf |title=Brief of accident; Sikorsky S-76C aircraft registration N748P |date=2010-11-24 |work= |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |accessdate=May 2, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2009, [[US Airways Flight 1549]] from [[LaGuardia Airport]] to [[Charlotte/Douglas International Airport]] ditched into the [[Hudson River]] after experiencing a loss of both turbines. It is suspected that the engine failure was caused by running into a flock of geese at an altitude of about {{convert|975|m|ft|abbr=in}}, shortly after takeoff. All 150 passengers and 5 crew members were safely evacuated after a successful [[water landing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/us.airways.crash.2.909535.html US Airways Plane Crashes Into Hudson River] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416081801/http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/us.airways.crash.2.909535.html |date=April 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, 2010, the NTSB published its final report into the accident.&lt;ref name=NTSBMay2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2010/100504.html |title=CREW ACTIONS AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT CREDITED WITH SAVING LIVES IN US AIRWAYS 1549 HUDSON RIVER DITCHING, NTSB SAYS |publisher=NTSB |accessdate=19 Aug 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bug strikes==
Flying insect strikes, like bird strikes, have been encountered by pilots since aircraft were invented. Future United States Air Force general [[Henry H. Arnold]], as a young officer, nearly lost control of his [[Wright Model B]] in 1911 after a bug flew into his eye while he was not wearing goggles, distracting him.

In 1986 a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] on a low-level training mission entered a swarm of [[locust]]s. The insects' impacts on the aircraft's windscreens rendered the crew unable to see, forcing them to abort the mission and fly using the aircraft's instruments alone. The aircraft eventually landed safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Low-level locusts: Think through the potential consequences of any plan |author=Turek, Raymond |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Low-level+locusts%3a+Think+through+the+potential+on+sequences+of+any...-a085592518 |newspaper=Combat Edge (The US Department of the Air Force) |date=March 2002 |accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the Australian [[Civil Aviation Safety Authority]] (CASA) issued a warning to pilots about the potential dangers of flying through a locust swarm. CASA warned that the insects could cause loss of engine power and loss of visibility, and blocking of an aircraft's [[pitot tube]]s, causing inaccurate [[airspeed]] readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aircraft warned to avoid flying in locust plague areas |author=Orreal, Jorja |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/aircraft-warned-to-avoid-flying-in-locust-plague-areas/story-e6freooo-1225929886445 |newspaper=The Courier Mail (Brisbane) |date=September 27, 2010 |accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Flying pests: locust threat to aircraft |author=Gray, Darren |url=http://theland.farmonline.com.au/news/state/agribusiness-and-general/general/flying-pests-locust-threat-to-aircraft/1953572.aspx |newspaper=The Land |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406024558/http://theland.farmonline.com.au/news/state/agribusiness-and-general/general/flying-pests-locust-threat-to-aircraft/1953572.aspx |archivedate=6 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bug strikes can also affect the operation of machinery on the ground, especially [[motorcycles]]. The team on the US TV show ''[[MythBusters]]'' – in a 2010 episode entitled [[MythBusters (2010 season)#Episode 156 .E2.80.93 .22Bug Special.22|"Bug Special"]] – concluded that death could occur if a motorist were hit by a flying insect of sufficient mass in a vulnerable part of the body. Anecdotal evidence from motorcyclists supports pain, bruising, soreness, stings, and loss of seat caused by collision with an insect at speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.facebook.com/MythBusters/posts/175100975852383 | publisher = Facebook | title = Could a bug strike be fatal?

'''Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁlkamij sɛ̃sɑ̃s|lang}};{{refn|Although French-speaking musicians and intellectuals often still use the traditional pronunciation without "s" at the end ({{IPA-fr|sɛ̃sɑ̃|}}), the pronunciation with "s" is now very common in French, even among radio announcers. Saint-Saëns himself wanted his name to be pronounced like that of the town [[Saint-Saëns, Seine-Maritime|Saint-Saëns]], which was pronounced without "s" at the end until about 1940–1950 in accordance with the spelling without "s" that was in use until about 1840–1860, as explained by Claude Fournier in his history of the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lereveildeneufchatel.fr/2015/01/12/doit-on-prononcer-le-s-final-de-saint-saens/ ''Doit-on prononcer le "s" final de Saint-Saëns ?''] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] on the e dates from a time when the e was not silent, but the diaeresis no longer affects the pronunciation of the name(s) because the e is silent, as in the name [[Madame de Staël]], for example.|group=n}} 9 October 1835{{spaced ndash}}16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]]. His best-known works include [[Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso]] (1863), the [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Saëns)|Second Piano Concerto]] (1868), the [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Saint-Saëns)|First Cello Concerto]] (1872), ''[[Danse macabre (Saint-Saëns)|Danse macabre]]'' (1874), the opera ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1877), the [[Violin Concerto No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Third Violin Concerto]] (1880), the [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Third ("Organ") Symphony]] (1886) and ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' (1886).

Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the [[Paris Conservatoire]] he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at [[Saint-Merri]], Paris and, from 1858, [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]], the official church of the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]]. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas.

As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the [[Impressionism in music|impressionist]] and [[dodecaphonic]] schools of music; although there were [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] elements in his music, foreshadowing works by [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and [[Les Six]], he was often regarded as a reactionary in the  decades around the time of his death.

Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included [[Gabriel Fauré]], among whose own later pupils was [[Maurice Ravel]]. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
[[File:Paris (France) rue du jardinet 2.JPG|thumb|alt=Parisian street view of narrow side-street|The rue du Jardinet, site of Saint-Saëns's birthplace]]

Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, ''née'' Collin.&lt;ref name=grove /&gt; Victor Saint-Saëns was of [[Normandy|Norman]] ancestry, and his wife was from an [[Haute-Marne]] family;{{refn| During the [[Dreyfus affair]] when anti-Semitism was rife among opponents of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], it was rumoured that Saint-Saëns, who had contributed money for Dreyfus's defence, was really surnamed "Kahn".&lt;ref name=duchen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques-Gabriel Prod’homme|Prod'homme]], p. 470&lt;/ref&gt; That Saint-Saëns was of partial Jewish origin through his mother was indeed reported by some early 20th-century music historians such as Gdal Saleski.&lt;ref name="San Diego Jewish World"&gt;Wingard, Eileen.

[[File:Saint-Saens-1846.jpg|thumb|left|alt=sketch of young boy at piano keyboard|upright|Saint-Saëns as a boy]]
When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed [[perfect pitch]] and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano.&lt;ref name=schon&gt;Schonberg, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of [[Camille-Marie Stamaty]], a former pupil of [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]].&lt;ref&gt;Gallois, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training.&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Saëns, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic [[Harold C. Schonberg]] wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, "It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart."&lt;ref name=schonberg&gt;Schonberg, Harold C. "It All Came Too Easily For Camille Saint-Saëns", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 12 January 1969, p. D17&lt;/ref&gt; The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the [[Salle Pleyel]], in a programme that included [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 15 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto in B{{music|flat}}]] ([[Köchel-Verzeichnis|K]]450), and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Ratner, Sabina Teller.

Retrieved 7 February 2015 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher [[Alexandre Pierre François Boëly]]. From the latter he acquired a lifelong love of the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], which was then little known in France.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

As a schoolboy Saint-Saëns was outstanding in many subjects. In addition to his musical prowess, he distinguished himself in the study of French literature, Latin and Greek, divinity, and mathematics. His interests included philosophy, archaeology and astronomy, of which, particularly the last, he remained a talented amateur in later life.&lt;ref name=grove /&gt;{{refn|In a 2012 symposium on Saint-Saëns, Léo Houziaux contributed a study of the composer's contributions to astronomy, including three papers he wrote between 1889 and 1913 for French journals.&lt;ref&gt;Houziaux, pp. 12–25&lt;/ref&gt; Houziaux concludes that Saint-Saëns's contributions helped to popularise the science of astronomy in France.&lt;ref&gt;Houziaux, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

[[File:Old Conservatoire de Paris building, early19th century.jpg|thumb|alt=Exterior of 19th-century French city building|The old Paris Conservatoire building, where Saint-Saëns studied]]
In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the [[Paris Conservatoire]], France's foremost music academy. The director, [[Daniel Auber]], had succeeded [[Luigi Cherubini]] in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The Conservatoire remained a bastion of musical conservatism until 1905, when Saint-Saëns's former pupil [[Gabriel Fauré]] became director and radically liberalised the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist.&lt;ref name="Rees, p. 41"&gt;Rees, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; His organ professor was [[François Benoist]], whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; his pupils included [[Adolphe Adam]], [[César Franck]], [[Charles Alkan]], [[Louis James Alfred Lefébure-Wély|Louis Lefébure-Wély]] and [[Georges Bizet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Macdonald|Macdonald, Hugh]].

Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, ''Les Djinns'' (1850), after an [[Les Djinns (poem)|eponymous poem]] by [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref name=fallon&gt;Fallon, Daniel.

===Early career===
[[File:Saint Merri Church Interior 2, Paris, France - Diliff.jpg|alt=interior of Gothic church|thumb|The church of [[Saint-Merri]], Paris, where Saint-Saëns was organist, 1853–57]]
On leaving the Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns accepted the post of organist at the ancient Parisian church of [[Saint-Merri]] near the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]. The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year there were more than two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The organ, the work of [[François-Henri Clicquot]], had been badly damaged in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]] and imperfectly restored. The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E{{music|flat}} (1853).&lt;ref name=fallon/&gt; This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of [[Napoleon III]] and the restoration of the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile.&lt;ref&gt;Studd, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the musicians who were quick to spot Saint-Saëns's talent were the composers [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Hector Berlioz]] and [[Franz Liszt]], and the influential singer [[Pauline Viardot]], who all encouraged him in his career.&lt;ref name=grove /&gt; In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]], the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 87; and Harding, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in later life he had a reputation for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Saëns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref name=grove /&gt; Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Saëns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner's operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 39; and Parker, p. 574&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=klein/&gt; He commented, "I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character. They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for me. But I am not, I have never been, and I shall never be of the Wagnerian religion."&lt;ref name=klein&gt;Klein, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

===1860s: Teacher and growing fame===
[[File:Gabriel Fauré en uniforme de l'Ecole Niedermeyer.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=young man in 19th-century college uniform|[[Gabriel Fauré]], pupil, protégé and lifelong friend of Saint-Saëns, as a student]]
In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which [[Louis Niedermeyer]] had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1989), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known pupil, [[Gabriel Fauré]], recalled in old age:
{{quote|After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known.&amp;nbsp;... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment&amp;nbsp;... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life.&lt;ref&gt;Fauré in 1922, ''quoted'' in Nectoux, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;|}}
Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including [[André Messager]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ratner (1999), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; He conceived his best-known piece, ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'', with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.&lt;ref&gt;Ratner (1999), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote:
{{quote|We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity. But the other man, who is still a student, has that inner fire, inspiration, he feels, he can do things that can't be learnt and the rest he'll learn more or less.

According to the musical scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his well-known ''bon mot'' about Saint-Saëns, "He knows everything, but lacks inexperience"&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO "LACKS EXPERIENCE": IT IS CORRECT AS IT IS (IT IS BERLIOZ'S LITTLE JOKE) --&gt; ("Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexpérience").&lt;ref&gt;Gallois, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Other writers recount and date the saying differently.

He himself wrote, "Art is intended to create beauty and character. Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it.

===1870s: War, marriage and operatic success===
In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and [[Romain Bussine]], professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music.&lt;ref name=r133/&gt; Before they could take the proposal further, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] broke out.

As an admirer of Liszt's innovative [[symphonic poem]]s, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first "poème symphonique" was ''[[Le Rouet d'Omphale]]'' (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. ''[[La princesse jaune]]'' ("The Yellow Princess"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the [[Opéra-Comique]], Paris in June. It ran for five performances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Macdonald|Macdonald, Hugh]].

Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the [[Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré]] with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying.&lt;ref name=duchen /&gt;{{refn|name=M.Morris|group=n}} The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was not a success. In the words of the biographer Sabina Teller Ratner, "Saint-Saëns's mother disapproved, and her son was difficult to live with".&lt;ref name=grove /&gt; Saint-Saëns and his wife moved to the [[Rue Monsieur-le-Prince]], in the [[Latin Quarter]]; his mother moved with them.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two sons, both of whom died in infancy. In 1878, the elder, André, aged two, fell from a window of the flat and was killed;&lt;ref&gt;Studd, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; the younger, Jean-François, died of pneumonia six weeks later, aged six months. Saint-Saëns and Marie-Laure continued to live together for three years, but he blamed her for André's accident; the double blow of their loss effectively destroyed the marriage.&lt;ref name=duchen /&gt;

The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy "To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition".&lt;ref name=s108&gt;Smith, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died.

In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with ''[[Samson et Dalila]]'', his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at [[Weimar]] in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the [[Paris Opéra]] until 1892.&lt;ref name=crichton/&gt;

Saint-Saëns was a keen traveller. From the 1870s until the end of his life he made 179 trips to 27 countries. His professional engagements took him most often to Germany and England; for holidays, and to avoid Parisian winters which affected his weak chest, he favoured Algiers and various places in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Leteuré, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

===1880s: International figure===
Saint-Saëns was elected to the [[Institut de France]] in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In July of that year he and his wife went to the [[Auvergne|Auvergnat]] spa town of [[La Bourboule]] for a holiday. On 28 July he disappeared from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say that he would not be returning. They never saw each other again. Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near [[Bordeaux]] at the age of ninety-five.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman. Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, pp. 198–201&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=M.Morris|In a 2012 study of the composer's private life, Mitchell Morris mentions but classes as apocryphal a story attributing to Saint-Saëns the remark, "Je ne suis pas [[Homosexuality|homosexuel]]. Je suis [[Pederasty|pédéraste]]".&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benjamin Ivry in a 2000 biography of [[Maurice Ravel]], Saint-Saëns "was plagued by blackmailing letters from North African men he paid, apparently too little, for sex"; Ivry cites no authority for the statement.&lt;ref&gt;Ivry, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Studd (1999) and Kenneth Ring (2002) conclude that apart from his marriage, Saint-Saëns's relationships and inclinations were platonic.&lt;ref&gt;Studd, pp. 252–254; and Ring, pp. 68–70&lt;/ref&gt; The composer himself was indifferent to rumours about him: "If it is said that I have a bad character, I assure you that it is all the same to me. Take me as I am."&lt;ref&gt;Studd, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Duchen, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Marie told him, "For us you are one of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here."&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux and Jones (1989), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s Saint-Saëns continued to seek success in the opera house, an undertaking made the more difficult by an entrenched belief among influential members of the musical establishment that it was unthinkable that a pianist, organist and symphonist could write a good opera.&lt;ref name=go&gt;[[Hugh Macdonald|Macdonald, Hugh]].

Retrieved 18 February 2015 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had two operas staged during the decade, the first being ''[[Henry VIII (opera)|Henry VIII]]'' (1883) commissioned by the Paris Opéra. Although the libretto was not of his choosing, Saint-Saëns, normally a fluent, even facile composer,{{refn|Studying [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] manuscripts in London, Saint-Saëns was disconcerted to find a composer who worked even more quickly than he did.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} worked at the score with unusual diligence to capture a convincing air of 16th-century England.&lt;ref name=go/&gt; The work was a success, and was frequently revived during the composer's lifetime.&lt;ref name=crichton/&gt; When it was produced at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in 1898, ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' commented that though French librettists generally "make a pretty hash of British history", this piece was "not altogether contemptible as an opera story".&lt;ref&gt;"Royal Opera, Covent-Garden", ''The Era'', 16 July 1898, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The open-mindedness of the Société Nationale had hardened by the mid-1880s into a dogmatic adherence to Wagnerian methods favoured by Franck's pupils, led by [[Vincent d'Indy]]. They had begun to dominate the organisation and sought to abandon its ''"Ars Gallica"'' ethos of commitment to French works. Bussine and Saint-Saëns found this unacceptable, and resigned in 1886.&lt;ref name=strasser/&gt;{{refn| In 1909 d'Indy's inflexibility led a new generation of composers, led by Fauré's pupils Ravel and [[Charles Koechlin]], to break away and found a new group, Société Musicale Indépendant, whose ideals were closer to the original vision of Saint-Saëns and his colleagues in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1989), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} Having long pressed the merits of Wagner on a sometimes sceptical French public, Saint-Saëns was now becoming worried that the German's music was having an excessive impact on young French composers. His increasing caution towards Wagner developed in later years into stronger hostility, directed as much at Wagner's political nationalism as at his music.&lt;ref name=strasser/&gt;

By the 1880s Saint-Saëns was an established favourite with audiences in England, where he was widely regarded as the greatest living French composer.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886 the [[Royal Philharmonic Society|Philharmonic Society]] of London commissioned what became one of his most popular and respected works, the [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Third ("Organ") Symphony]]. It was premiered in London at a concert in which Saint-Saëns appeared as conductor of the symphony and as soloist in Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], conducted by [[Arthur Sullivan|Sir Arthur Sullivan]].&lt;ref&gt;"Philharmonic Society", ''The Times'', 22 May 1886, p. 5; and "Music – Philharmonic Society", ''The Daily News'', 27 May 1886, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the symphony in London was considerable, but was surpassed by the ecstatic welcome the work received at its Paris premiere early the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Deruchie, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1887 Saint-Saëns's "drame lyrique" ''Proserpine'' opened at the Opéra-Comique. It was well received and seemed to be heading for a substantial run when the theatre burnt down within weeks of the premiere and the production was lost.&lt;ref name=go/&gt;

In December 1888 Saint-Saëns's mother died.&lt;ref&gt;Leteuré, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; He felt her loss deeply, and was plunged into depression and insomnia, even contemplating suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Studd, pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt; He left Paris and stayed in Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

===1890s: Marking time===
[[File:CSaint-Saens.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=bust-length portrait of Saint-Saëns with a beard in a vest and suit, looking at the viewer|Saint-Saëns photographed by [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]]]]
During the 1890s Saint-Saëns spent much time on holiday, travelling overseas, composing less and performing more infrequently than before. A planned visit to perform in Chicago fell through in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1989), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote one opera, the comedy ''Phryné'' (1893), and together with [[Paul Dukas]] helped to complete ''Frédégonde'' (1895) an opera left unfinished by [[Ernest Guiraud]], who died in 1892. ''Phryné'' was well received, and prompted calls for more comic operas at the Opéra-Comique, which had latterly been favouring [[grand opera]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Opera by Saint-Saëns", ''The Times'', 25 May 1893, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; His few choral and orchestral works from the 1890s are mostly short; the major concert pieces from the decade were the single movement [[fantasia (music)|fantasia]] ''Africa'' (1891) and his [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Saint-Saëns)|Fifth ("Egyptian") Piano Concerto]], which he premiered at a concert in 1896 marking the fiftieth anniversary of his début at the Salle Pleyel in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Studd, pp. 203–204&lt;/ref&gt; Before playing the concerto he read out a short poem he had written for the event, praising his mother's tutelage and his public's long support.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Saint-Saëns", ''The Times'', 5 June 1896, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the concerts that Saint-Saëns undertook during the decade was one at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in June 1893, when he, [[Max Bruch|Bruch]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] performed at an event presented by [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] for the [[Cambridge University Musical Society]], marking the award of honorary degrees to all three visitors.&lt;ref&gt;"Cambridge University Musical Society", ''The Times'', 13 June 1893, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Saëns greatly enjoyed the visit, and even spoke approvingly of the college chapel services: "The demands of English religion are not excessive. The services are very short, and consist chiefly of listening to good music extremely well sung, for the English are excellent choristers".&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; His mutual regard for British choirs continued for the rest of his life, and one of his last large-scale works, the [[oratorio]] ''The Promised Land'', was composed for the [[Three Choirs Festival]] of 1913.&lt;ref&gt;"Gloucester Music Festival", ''The Times'', 12 September 1913, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===1900–21: Last years===
In 1900, after ten years without a permanent home in Paris, Saint-Saëns took a flat in the rue de Courcelles, not far from his old residence in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. This remained his home for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=p484&gt;Prod'homme, p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to travel abroad frequently, but increasingly often to give concerts rather than as a tourist. He revisited London, where he was always a welcome visitor, went to Berlin, where until the First World War, he was greeted with honour, and travelled in Italy, Spain, Monaco and provincial France.&lt;ref name=p484/&gt; In 1906 and 1909 he made highly successful tours of the US, as a pianist and conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, pp. 370–371 and 381&lt;/ref&gt; In New York on his second visit he premiered his "Praise ye the Lord" for double choir, orchestra and organ, which he composed for the occasion.&lt;ref name="Rees, p. 381"&gt;Rees, p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his growing reputation as a musical reactionary, Saint-Saëns was, according to Gallois, probably the only French musician who travelled to Munich to hear the premiere of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Eighth Symphony]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Gallois, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, by the 20th century Saint-Saëns had lost much of his enthusiasm for modernism in music. Though he strove to conceal it from Fauré, he did not understand or like the latter's opera ''[[Pénélope]]'' (1913), of which he was the dedicatee.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 [[Francis Poulenc]], at the beginning of his career as a composer, was dismissive when Ravel praised Saint-Saëns as a genius.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols. p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, various strands of new music were emerging with which Saint-Saëns had little in common. His classical instincts for form put him at odds with what seemed to him the shapelessness and structure of the musical impressionists, led by Debussy. Nor did the theories of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Arnold Schönberg]]'s [[dodecaphony]] commend themselves to Saint-Saëns:
{{quote|There is no longer any question of adding to the old rules new principles which are the natural expression of time and experience, but simply of casting aside all rules and every restraint. "Everyone ought to make his own rules. Music is free and unlimited in its liberty of expression. There are no perfect chords, dissonant chords or false chords. All aggregations of notes are legitimate." That is called, and they believe it, the ''development of taste''.&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Saëns, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;|}}
Holding such conservative views, Saint-Saëns was out of sympathy – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ballet ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Philip.

When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music during the First World War, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with their old teacher. They were privately concerned that their friend was in danger of looking foolish with his excess of patriotism,&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1989), pp. 162–165&lt;/ref&gt; and his growing tendency to denounce in public the works of rising young composers, as in his condemnation of Debussy's ''[[En blanc et noir]]'' (1915): "We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut against a man capable of such atrocities; they should be put next to the [[cubist]] pictures."&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; His determination to block Debussy's candidacy for election to the Institut was successful, and caused bitter resentment from the younger composer's supporters. Saint-Saëns's response to the neoclassicism of [[Les Six]] was equally uncompromising: of [[Darius Milhaud]]'s [[polytonal]] symphonic suite ''Protée'' (1919) he commented, "fortunately, there are still lunatic asylums in France".&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;

[[File:Saint-Saëns-farewell-concert-1913.jpeg|alt=interior of packed concert hall during a concert|thumb|upright=1.5|Saint-Saëns at the piano for his planned farewell concert in 1913, conducted by [[Pierre Monteux]]]]
Saint-Saëns gave what he intended to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in abeyance as a result of the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities.&lt;ref name=p484/&gt; These activities took him across the Atlantic, despite the danger from German warships.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 430&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut for a large invited audience; it was remarked that his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his personal bearing was admirable for a man of eighty-six.&lt;ref&gt;Prod'homme, p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do. While there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921. His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the [[Cimetière de Montparnasse]].&lt;ref name=studd288&gt;Studd, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881.&lt;ref name=studd288/&gt;

==Music==
{{see also|List of compositions by Camille Saint-Saëns}}
In the early years of the 20th century, the anonymous author of the article on Saint-Saëns in ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' wrote:
{{quote|Saint-Saëns is a consummate master of composition, and no one possesses a more profound knowledge than he does of the secrets and resources of the art; but the creative faculty does not keep pace with the technical skill of the workman. His incomparable talent for orchestration enables him to give relief to ideas which would otherwise be crude and mediocre in themselves&amp;nbsp;... his works are on the one hand not frivolous enough to become popular in the widest sense, nor on the other do they take hold of the public by that sincerity and warmth of feeling which is so convincing.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller Maitland, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;|}}
Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Saëns was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past. In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic D{{space}}C{{space}}Parker wrote, "That Saint-Saëns knows [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Rameau]]{{space}}... [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Josef Haydn|Haydn]] and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings. His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art."&lt;ref&gt;Parker, p. 563&lt;/ref&gt;

Less attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Saëns often favoured self-contained melodies. Though they are frequently, in Ratner's phrase, "supple and pliable", more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the "phrase pattern AABB is characteristic".&lt;ref name=g2/&gt; An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him. ''Grove'' observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring. In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar. Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although ''Grove'' points to a 5/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works.&lt;ref name=g2/&gt;

===Orchestral works===
The authors of the 1955 ''[[The Record Guide]]'', [[Edward Sackville-West, 5th Baron Sackville|Edward Sackville-West]] and [[Desmond Shawe-Taylor (music critic)|Desmond Shawe-Taylor]] write that Saint-Saëns's brilliant musicianship was "instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians to the fact that that there are other forms of music besides opera."&lt;ref name=rg&gt;Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 641&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2001 edition of ''Grove's Dictionary'', Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Saëns's orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A (c.1850) as the most ambitious of the composer's juvenilia. Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable. The "Urbs Roma" Symphony (1856) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and "thick and heavy" in its effect.&lt;ref name=g2 /&gt; Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as a fine example of orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer's mastery of [[fugue|fugal]] writing. The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ. It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune. The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Saëns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885).&lt;ref name=g2/&gt; The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring ''motif'' treated in a Lisztian style of [[thematic transformation]].&lt;ref name=rg/&gt;

[[File:Liszt-inscribed-to-fauré.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Picture postcard with portrait and hand-written inscription|Saint-Saëns modelled his [[symphonic poem]]s on those of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], seen here on a postcard inscribed to [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]]]]
Saint-Saëns's four symphonic poems follow the model of those by Liszt, though, in Sackville-West's and Shawe-Taylor's view, without the "vulgar blatancy" to which the earlier composer was prone.&lt;ref name=rg2&gt;Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, pp. 642–643&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular of the four is ''[[Danse macabre (Saint-Saëns)|Danse macabre]]'' (1874) depicting skeletons dancing at midnight. Saint-Saëns generally achieved his orchestral effects by deft harmonisation rather than exotic instrumentation,&lt;ref name=g2/&gt; but in this piece he featured the [[xylophone]] prominently, representing the rattling bones of the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Le Rouet d'Omphale]]'' (1870) was composed soon after the horrors of the Commune, but its lightness and delicate orchestration give no hint of recent tragedies.&lt;ref name=r177&gt;Rees, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Rees rates ''Phaëton'' (1873) as the finest of the symphonic poems, belying the composer's professed indifference to melody,{{refn|Saint-Saëns wrote in his book ''Musical Memories'', "He who does not get absolute pleasure from a simple series of well-constructed chords, beautiful only in their arrangement, is not really fond of music."&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Saëns, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} and inspired in its depiction of the [[Phaethon|mythical hero]] and his fate.&lt;ref name=r177/&gt; A critic at the time of the premiere took a different view, hearing in the piece "the noise of a hack coming down from Montmartre" rather than the galloping fiery horses of Greek legend that inspired the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2006), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the four symphonic poems, ''La jeunesse d'Hercule'' ("Hercules's Youth", 1877) was the most ambitious of the four, which, Harding suggests, is why it is the least successful.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; In the judgment of the critic [[Roger Nichols (musical scholar)|Roger Nichols]] these orchestral works, which combine striking melodies, strength of construction and memorable orchestration "set new standards for French music and were an inspiration to such young composers as Ravel".&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;

Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, ''Javot'' (1896), the score for the film ''[[The Assassination of the Duke of Guise|L'assassinat du duc de Guise]]'' (1908),{{refn|This music is sometimes cited as the first score composed for a film, but there were earlier examples including one by [[Herman Finck]] (1904).&lt;ref&gt;Wierzbicki, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} and incidental music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916. Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by [[Molière]] and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]].&lt;ref name=fallon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concertante works===
Saint-Saëns was the first major French composer to write piano concertos. His [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Saint-Saëns)|First]], in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Saëns)|Second]], in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works. The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary [[sonata form]] first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn [[cadenza]]. The [[scherzo]] second movement and ''[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|presto]]'' finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist [[Zygmunt Stojowski]] commented that the work "begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach".&lt;ref&gt;Herter, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Third Piano Concerto]], in E{{music|flat}} (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines.&lt;ref name=schonberg/&gt; The [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Saint-Saëns)|Fourth]], in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second. It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos. According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Saëns "the Beethoven of France" (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony).&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1989), p. 3; and Deruchie, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor. The work is known as the "Egyptian" concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in [[Luxor]], and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Saint-Saëns)|First Cello Concerto]], in A minor (1872) is a serious although animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section. It is among the most popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by [[Pablo Casals]] and later players.&lt;ref&gt;Ratner (2002), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cello Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Saëns)|Second]], in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections. It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saint-Saëns commented to Fauré that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult. There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Saëns)|Second]], in C major.&lt;ref&gt;Ratner (2002), p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; The First, in A, was also completed in 1858. It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting less than a quarter of an hour.&lt;ref&gt;Ratner (2002), p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Ratner (2002), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Violin Concerto No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Third]], in B minor, written for [[Pablo de Sarasate]], is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (2009), pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Saëns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the [[Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso]], in A minor, Op. 28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863. It changes from a wistful opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, "After a multi-stopped cadenza&amp;nbsp;... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major".&lt;ref&gt;Larner, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operas===
[[File:Samson-et-dalila-1892.jpg|thumb|alt=Press illustration of opera production, showing singer playing Samson demolishing the enemy temple|''[[Samson et Dalila]]'' at the [[Paris Opéra]], 1892: Samson ([[Edmond Vergnet]]) destroys the Philistine temple]]
Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished ''Frédégonde'', Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are ''[[Opéra comique|opéras comiques]]''. During the composer's lifetime his ''[[Henry VIII (opera)|Henry VIII]]'' became a repertory piece; since his death only ''Samson et Dalila'' has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, ''[[Ascanio]]'' (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work.&lt;ref name=schonberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=crichton/&gt; The critic [[Ronald Crichton]] writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns "lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior".&lt;ref name=crichton/&gt; In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: "Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics".&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Saëns's biographer [[James Harding (music writer)|James Harding]] comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of ''La princesse jaune'', which Harding describes as like Sullivan "with a light French touch".&lt;ref name=h119&gt;Harding, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Saint-Saëns was friendly with Sullivan, and liked his music, making a point of seeing the latest [[Savoy opera]] when in London.&lt;ref name=h119/&gt;|group= n}}

Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as "a bridge between [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] and the serious French operas of the early 1890s".&lt;ref name=crichton353&gt;Crichton, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – "lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content{{space}}... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable."&lt;ref name=crichton/&gt; Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece;&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; for ''Henry VIII'' he included [[Tudor period|Tudor]] music he had researched in London;&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; in ''La princesse jaune'' he used an oriental [[pentatonic]] scale;&lt;ref name=g2&gt;Fallon, Daniel, and Sabina Teller Ratner. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/24335#S24335.2 "Saint-Saëns, Camille: Works"], Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 18 February 2015 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Wagner he derived the use of [[leitmotif]]s, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as [[Through-composed#Opera and musicals|through composition]] is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less variety of tempo within individual numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of recorded opera [[Alan Blyth]] writes that Saint-Saëns "certainly learned much from Handel, Gluck, Berlioz, the Verdi of ''[[Aida]]'', and Wagner, but from these excellent models he forged his own style."&lt;ref&gt;Blyth, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other vocal music===
[[File:Corneille-Lamartine-Hugo-Klein.jpg|thumb|alt=head and shoulders portraits of three 19th-century and one 20th-century writers, all of middle age|[[Pierre Corneille]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Herman Klein]], whose words Saint-Saëns set in songs and choral works]]
From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed ''[[mélodie]]s'', writing more than 140.&lt;ref&gt;Fauser, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] or other German composers of ''[[Lieder]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fauser, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – ''Mélodies persanes'' ("Persian Songs", 1870) and ''Le Cendre rouge'' ("The Red Ash Tree", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was [[Victor Hugo]]; others included [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Amable Tastu]], and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer [[Lili Boulanger]] that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: "you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable."&lt;ref&gt;Fauser, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ''mélodies'' are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including "Le lever du soleil sur le Nil" ("Sunrise over the Nile", 1898) and "Hymne à la paix" ("Hymn to Peace", 1919), are for voice and orchestra.&lt;ref name=fallon/&gt; His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]].&lt;ref&gt;Fauser, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from [[motet]]s to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios ''Le déluge'' (1875) and ''The Promised Land'' (1913) with an English text by [[Herman Klein]].&lt;ref name=fallon /&gt; He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, "One likes to be appreciated in the home, ''par excellence'', of oratorio."&lt;ref name=klein /&gt; He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra.&lt;ref name=fallon /&gt; In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach was old-fashioned, and the familiarity of Saint-Saëns's treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it.&lt;ref name=klein /&gt;

===Solo keyboard===
Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, "this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark".&lt;ref name=ox/&gt; Nichols excepts the ''Étude en forme de valse'' (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique.&lt;ref name=ox&gt;Nichols, Roger.

Retrieved 21 February 2015 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Saint-Saëns was dubbed "the French Beethoven", and his Variations on a Theme of Beethoven in E{{music|flat}} (1874) is his most extended work for unaccompanied piano, he did not emulate his predecessor in composing piano sonatas. He is not known even to have contemplated writing one.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; There are sets of bagatelles (1855), études (two sets – 1899 and 1912) and fugues (1920), but in general Saint-Saëns's works for the piano are single short pieces. In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as "Souvenir d'Italie" (1887), "Les cloches du soir" ("Evening bells", 1889) and "Souvenir d'Ismaïlia" (1895).&lt;ref name=fallon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Maurice J E, and Kenneth L Hamilton.

Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, pp. 525–558&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them were written for use in church services – "Offertoire" (1853), "Bénédiction nuptiale" (1859), "Communion" (1859) and others. After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former.&lt;ref name=fallon /&gt;

===Chamber===
Saint-Saëns wrote more than forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years. One of the first of his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, confident piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other ''cantabile''.&lt;ref name=r2005 /&gt; The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms. At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of [[Baroque music|baroque]] composers including [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Rameau]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]].&lt;ref name=g2 /&gt;

{{Quote box |bgcolor=#CEF6EC|salign=right| quote = Saint-Saëns's chamber works reveal the complete man: his sense of tradition coupled with imagination, his feeling for colour, his sense of humour, his desire for balance and symmetry, his love of clarity. |source= Sabina Teller Ratner, 2005&lt;ref name=r2005&gt;Ratner (2005), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;|align=left| width=30%}}In Ratner's view, the most important of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment.&lt;ref name=r2005/&gt; The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by ''Grove's Dictionary'' as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions.

Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo.&lt;ref name="Rees, p. 381"/&gt;

The woodwind sonatas are among the composer's last works. Ratner writes of them, "The spare, evocative, classical lines, haunting melodies, and superb formal structures underline these beacons of the neoclassical movement."&lt;ref name=r2005 /&gt; Gallois comments that the [[Oboe Sonata (Saint-Saëns)|Oboe Sonata]] begins like a conventional classical sonata, with an andantino theme; the central section has rich and colourful harmonies, and the molto allegro finale is full of delicacy, humour and charm with a form of [[tarantella]]. For Gallois the Clarinet Sonata is the most important of the three: he calls it "a masterpiece full of impishness, elegance and discreet lyricism" amounting to "a summary of the rest".&lt;ref&gt;Gallois, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; The work contrasts a "doleful [[threnody]]" in the slow movement with the finale, which "pirouettes in 4/4 time", in a style reminiscent of the 18th century. The same commentator calls the Bassoon Sonata "a model of transparency, vitality and lightness", containing humorous touches but also moments of peaceful contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;Gallois, pp. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt;

The composer's most famous work, ''The Carnival of the Animals'' (1887), although far from a typical chamber piece, is written for eleven players, and is considered by ''Grove's Dictionary'' to be part of Saint-Saëns's chamber output. ''Grove'' rates it as "his most brilliant comic work, parodying Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Rossini, his own ''Danse macabre'' and several popular tunes".&lt;ref name=g2/&gt; He forbade performances of it during his lifetime, concerned that its frivolity would damage his reputation as a serious composer.&lt;ref name=duchen/&gt;

===Recordings===
Saint-Saëns was a pioneer in recorded music. In June 1904 [[The Gramophone Company]] of London sent its producer [[Fred Gaisberg]] to Paris to record Saint-Saëns as accompanist to the [[mezzo-soprano]] Meyriane Héglon in arias from ''Ascanio'' and ''Samson et Dalila'', and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra).&lt;ref name=marston&gt;[http://www.marstonrecords.com/legendary-piano/legendary_piano_ward.htm Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406023523/http://www.marstonrecords.com/legendary-piano/legendary_piano_ward.htm |date=6 April 2015 }} and [http://www.marstonrecords.com/legendary-piano/legendary_piano_tracks.htm Track Listing]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406023518/http://www.marstonrecords.com/legendary-piano/legendary_piano_tracks.htm |date=6 April 2015 }}, "Legendary piano recordings: the complete Grieg, Saint-Saëns, Pugno, and Diémer and other G &amp; T rarities", Ward Marston. Retrieved 24 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Saëns made more recordings for the company in 1919.&lt;ref name=marston /&gt;

In the early days of the [[LP record]], Saint-Saëns's works were patchily represented on disc. ''The Record Guide'' (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of ''Danse Macabre'', ''The Carnival of the Animals'', the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works.&lt;ref&gt;Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, pp. 642–644&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, many more of the composer's works were released on LP and later CD and DVD. The 2008 ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music|Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music]]'' contains ten pages of listings of Saint-Saëns works, including all the concertos, symphonies, symphonic poems, sonatas and quartets. Also listed are an early Mass, collections of organ music, and choral songs.&lt;ref&gt;March, pp. 1122–1131&lt;/ref&gt; A recording of twenty-seven of Saint-Saëns's ''mélodies'' was released in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/songs/oclc/37703970&amp;referer=brief_results "Songs – Saint Saëns"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906195526/http://www.worldcat.org/title/songs/oclc/37703970%26referer%3Dbrief_results |date=6 September 2018 }}, WorldCat. Retrieved 24 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of ''Samson et Dalila'' the operas have been sparsely represented on disc. A recording of ''Henry VIII'' was issued on CD and DVD in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/henry-viii/oclc/29499717&amp;referer=brief_results "Henry VIII"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906195809/http://www.worldcat.org/title/henry-viii/oclc/29499717%26referer%3Dbrief_results |date=6 September 2018 }}, WorldCat.

==Honours and reputation==
Saint-Saëns was made a Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1867 and promoted to Officier in 1884, and Grand Croix in 1913. Foreign honours included the British [[Royal Victorian Order]] (CVO) in 1902, and honorary doctorates from the universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (1893) and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1907).&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U202564 "Saint-Saëns, Camille"], ''Who Was Who'', Oxford University Press, 2014. Retrieved 21 February 2015 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its obituary notice, ''The Times'' commented:
{{quote|The death of M. Saint-Saëns not only deprives France of one of her most distinguished composers; it removes from the world the last representative of the great movements in music which were typical of the 19th century. He had maintained so vigorous a vitality and kept in such close touch with present-day activities that, though it had become customary to speak of him as the ''doyen'' of French composers, it was easy to forget the place he actually took in musical chronology. He was only two years younger than Brahms, was five years older than Tchaikovsky, six years older than [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], and seven years older than Sullivan. He held a position in his own country's music certain aspects of which may be fitly compared with each of those masters in their own spheres.&lt;ref name=times&gt;"M. Saint-Saëns", ''The Times'', 19 December 1921, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

In a short poem, "Mea culpa", published in 1890 Saint-Saëns accused himself of lack of decadence, and commented approvingly on the excessive enthusiasms of youth, lamenting that such things were not for him.{{refn|"''Mea culpa!'' Je m'accuse de n'être point décadent."&lt;ref&gt;Gallois, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, "His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day."&lt;ref&gt;"M. Saint-Saëns's Essays", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 23 June 1910, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form. The critic [[H. C. Colles|Henry Colles]], wrote, a few days after the composer's death:
{{quote|In his desire to maintain "the perfect equilibrium" we find the limitation of Saint-Saëns's appeal to the ordinary musical mind. Saint-Saëns rarely, if ever, takes any risks; he never, to use the slang of the moment, "goes off the deep end". All his greatest contemporaries did. Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and even Franck, were ready to sacrifice everything for the end each wanted to reach, to drown in the attempt to get there if necessary. Saint-Saëns, in preserving his equilibrium, allows his hearers to preserve theirs.&lt;ref&gt;Colles, H. C. "Camille Saint-Saëns", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 22 December 1921, p. 853&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

''Grove'' concludes its article on Saint-Saëns with the observation that although his works are remarkably consistent, "it cannot be said that he evolved a distinctive musical style. Rather, he defended the French tradition that threatened to be engulfed by Wagnerian influences and created the environment that nourished his successors".&lt;ref name=g2/&gt;

Since the composer's death writers sympathetic to his music have expressed regret that he is known by the musical public for only a handful of his scores such as ''The Carnival of the Animals'', the Second Piano Concerto, the Organ Symphony, ''Samson et Dalila'', ''Danse macabre'' and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso. Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the [[Oratorio de Noël|Christmas Oratorio]], the ballet ''Javotte'', the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces.&lt;ref name=nicholas /&gt; In 2004, the cellist [[Steven Isserlis]] said, "Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself&amp;nbsp;... there are Masses, all of which are interesting. I've played all his cello music and there isn't one bad piece. His works are rewarding in every way. And he's an endlessly fascinating figure."&lt;ref name=duchen /&gt;

These plant fossils are from one of those forests from about 5 million years after the CRC. However, the composition of the forests changed from a [[lepidodendron]]-dominated forest to one of predominantly [[tree ferns]] and [[seed ferns]].]]
The '''Carboniferous rainforest collapse''' ('''CRC''') was a minor [[extinction event]] that occurred around 305 million years ago in the [[Carboniferous]] period.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFalconLang2010RainforestCollapse"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079|author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J.|year=2010| title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica|journal=Geology|doi=10.1130/G31182.1|volume = 38|pages = 1079–1082|format=PDF|issue=12|bibcode = 2010Geo....38.1079S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It altered the vast [[coal forest]]s that covered the equatorial region of [[Euramerica]] (Europe and America). This event may have fragmented the forests into isolated 'islands', which in turn caused dwarfism and, shortly after, extinction of many plant and animal species. Following the event, coal-forming tropical forests continued in large areas of the Earth, but their extent and composition were changed.

The event occurred at the end of the [[Moscovian (Carboniferous)|Moscovian]] and continued into the early [[Kasimovian]] stages of the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] (Upper Carboniferous).

==Extinction patterns on land==
[[File:Marriott Falls Vegetation.jpg|thumb|[[Fern]]s and [[Cyatheales|treeferns]] from [[Mount Field National Park]], giving an impression of how a Carboniferous rainforest might have looked.]]
In the Carboniferous, the great tropical rainforests of [[Euramerica]] supported towering [[lycopodiophyta]], a heterogeneous mix of vegetation, as well as a great diversity of animal life: giant dragonflies, millipedes, cockroaches, [[amphibian]]s, and the first [[amniote]]s.

===Plants===
The rise of rainforests in the Carboniferous greatly altered the landscapes by eroding low-energy, organic-rich [[anastomosis|anastomosing]] (braided) river systems with multiple channels and stable [[alluvium|alluvial]] islands. The continuing evolution of tree-like plants increased floodplain stability (less erosion and movement) by the density of floodplain forests, the production of woody debris, and an increase in complexity and diversity of root assemblages.&lt;ref name="DaviesGibling"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Davies, N.S.  |author2=Gibling, M. R.|year=2011|title=Evolution of fixed-channel alluvial plains in response to Carboniferous vegetation|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=21|pages=629–633|doi=10.1038/ngeo1237|bibcode = 2011NatGe...4..629D|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collapse occurred through a series of step changes. First there was a gradual rise in the frequency of opportunistic ferns in late Moscovian times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pfefferkorn, H.W. |author2=Thomson, M.C.|year=1982|title=Changes in dominance patterns in Upper Carboniferous plant fossil assemblages |journal=Geology|volume=10|pages=641|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1982)10&lt;641:CIDPIU&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1982Geo....10..641P|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in the earliest Kasimovian by a major, abrupt extinction of the dominant lycopsids and a change to [[Cyatheales|tree fern]]-dominated ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=DiMichele, W.A. |author2=Phillips, T.L.|year=1996|title= Climate change, plant extinctions and vegetational recovery during the Middle-Late Pennsylvanian transition: The case of tropical peat-forming environments in North America|journal=Biotic recovery from mass extinction events: Geological Society of London Special Publication|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed by a recent study showing that the presence of  [[meander]]ing and [[anabranch]]ing rivers, occurrences of large woody debris, and records of [[log jam]]s decrease significantly at the Moscovian-Kasimovian boundary.&lt;ref name="DaviesGibling" /&gt; Rainforests were fragmented, forming shrinking 'islands' further and further apart, and in latest Kasimovian time, rainforests vanished from the fossil record.

===Animals===
Before the collapse, animal species distribution was very cosmopolitan – the same species existed everywhere across tropical [[Pangaea]] – but after the collapse, each surviving rainforest 'island' developed its own unique mix of species. Many amphibian species became extinct, while reptiles diversified into more species after the initial crisis.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFalconLang2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt; These patterns are explained by the theory of [[insular biogeography]], a concept that explains how evolution progresses when populations are restricted into isolated pockets. This theory was originally developed for [[Island#Oceanic_islands|oceanic islands]], but it can be applied equally well to any other ecosystem that is fragmented, only existing in small patches and surrounded by another habitat. According to this theory, the initial impact of [[habitat fragmentation]] is devastating, with most life dying out quickly from lack of resources. Then, as surviving plants and animals reestablish themselves, they adapt to their restricted environment to take advantage of the new allotment of resources, and diversify. After the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, each pocket of life evolved in its own way, resulting in a unique species mix that ecologists call "[[endemism]]".

==Biotic recovery and evolutionary consequences==

===Plants===
The fragmentation of wetlands left a few isolated [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] in Europe; however, even these were unable to maintain the diversity of Moscovian flora.&lt;ref name="Cascales-MinanaCleal2013"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ter.12086/abstract |author1=Borja Cascales-Miñana |author2=Christopher J. Cleal |year=2013| title=The plant fossil record reflects just two great extinction events |journal=Terra Nova|doi=10.1111/ter.12086 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=195–200|bibcode=2014TeNov..26..195C}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the Asselian many families that characterized the Moscovian tropical wetlands had disappeared including [[Flemingitaceae]], [[Diaphorodendraceae]], [[Tedeleaceae]], [[Urnatopteridaceae]], [[Alethopteridaceae]]{{check|date=December 2016}}&lt;!-- article says survived into Permian --&gt;, [[Cyclopteridaceae]], and [[Neurodontopteridaceae]].&lt;ref name="Cascales-MinanaCleal2013" /&gt;

===Invertebrates===
The depletion of plant life contributed to declining concentrations of [[oxygen]] in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. High oxygen levels had made the enormous [[arthropods]] of the time possible. Due to the decreasing oxygen, these sizes could no longer be accommodated, and thus between this and the loss of habitat, the giant arthropods were wiped out in this event, most notably the giant dragonflies ([[Meganeura]]) and millipedes ([[Arthropleura]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

===Vertebrates===
[[File:Archaeothyris BW.jpg|thumb|right|Terrestrially adapted [[Pelycosaur|early mammal-like reptiles]] like ''[[Archaeothyris]]'' were among the groups who quickly recovered after the collapse.]]
This sudden collapse affected several large groups. [[Labyrinthodont]] amphibians were particularly devastated, while the first [[reptiles]] fared better, being physiologically better adapted to the drier conditions. 

Amphibians can survive cold conditions by decreasing metabolic rates and resorting to overwintering strategies (i.e. spending most of the year inactive in burrows or under logs). However, this is not an effective way to deal with prolonged unfavourable conditions, especially [[desiccation]]. Amphibians must return to water to lay eggs, while reptiles have [[amniote]] eggs that have a membrane ensuring gas exchange out of water. Because amphibians had a limited capacity to adapt to the drier conditions that dominated Permian environments, many amphibian families failed to occupy new ecological niches and became extinct.&lt;ref name="McInnes"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Miguel Á. Olalla-Tárraga1, Lynsey McInnes, Luis M. Bini, José A. F. Diniz-Filho, Susanne A. Fritz, Bradford A. Hawkins, Joaquín Hortal, C. David L. Orme1, Carsten Rahbek, Miguel Á. Rodríguez, Andy Purvis|year=2010|title=Climatic niche conservatism and the evolutionary dynamics in species range boundaries: global congruence across mammals and amphibians|journal=Journal of Biogeography|volume=38|issue=12|pages=2237–2247|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reptiles acquired new niches faster than amphibians and faster than before the collapse. They acquired new feeding strategies, including [[herbivory]] and [[Carnivore (disambiguation)|carnivory]], previously only having been [[insectivore]]s and [[piscivore]]s.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFalconLang2010RainforestCollapse" /&gt;

==Possible causes==
===Atmosphere and climate===
There are several hypotheses about the nature and cause of the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, some of which include [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fielding, C.R. |author2=Frank, T.D. |author3=Birgenheier, L.P. |author4=Rygel, M.C. |author5=Jones, A.T. |author6=Roberts, J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year=2008 |title=Stratigraphic imprint of the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age in eastern Australia: A record of alternating glacial and nonglacial climate regime|journal=Geological Society of London Journal|pages = 129–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Heckel, P.H. | year=1991 | title= Lost Branch Formation and revision of upper Desmoinesian stratigraphy along midcontinent Pennsylvanian outcrop belt | journal= Geological Survey Geology Series | volume = 4 | pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=DiMichele, W.A. |author2=Cecil, B. |author3=Montanez, I.P. |author4=Falcon-Lang, H.J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year=2010 | title= Cyclic changes in Pennsylvanian paleoclimate and effects on floristic dynamics in tropical Pangaea | journal= International Journal of Coal Geology | volume = 83 | pages =329–344 | doi= 10.1016/j.coal.2010.01.007 | issue= 2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a late Bashkirian interval of glaciation, high-frequency shifts in seasonality from humid to arid times began.&lt;ref name="Gulbransona"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Gulbransona, Montañezb |author2=Taborc, Limarinod | year=2014 | title=Late Pennsylvanian aridification on the southwestern margin of Gondwana (Paganzo Basin, NW Argentina): A regional expression of a global climate perturbation | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018214005409 | doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.10.029 | volume=417 | journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | pages=220–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The carboniferous period is characterised by the formation of coal deposits which were formed within a context of the removal of atmospheric carbon.  In the latest Middle Pennsylvanian (late Moscovian) a cycle of [[aridification]] began. At the time of the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, the climate became cooler and drier. This is reflected in the rock record as the Earth entered a short, intense ice age. Sea levels dropped by 100 m, and glacial ice covered most of the southern continent of [[Gondwana]].&lt;ref name="TheCarboniferousCrisis"/&gt; The climate was unfavourable to rainforests and much of the biodiversity in them. Rainforests shrank into isolated patches mostly confined to wet valleys further and further apart. Little of the original lycopsid rainforest biome survived this initial climate crisis. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere crashed to one of its all time global lows in the Pennsylvanian and early Permian.&lt;ref name="Gulbransona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheCarboniferousCrisis"&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Polly, D.P | year=2011 | title=The Carboniferous Crisis | url= http://www.indiana.edu/~g404/Lectures/Lecture%201%20-%20Carboniferous%20Crisis%20and%20Introduction%20to%20Vertebrate%20Geobiology.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then a succeeding period of global warming reversed the climatic trend; the remaining rainforests, unable to survive the rapidly changing conditions, were finally wiped out.{{vague|reason=No specifics given about time, geographical location or the nature of the "changing conditions".|date=September 2015}}{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

As the climate aridified again through the later Paleozoic, rainforests were eventually replaced by seasonally dry biomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Montañez, I.P. |author2=Tabor, N.J. |author3=Niemeier, D. |author4=DiMichele, W.A. |author5=Frank, T.D. |author6=Fielding, C.R. |author7=Isbell, J.L. |author8=Birgenheier, L.P. |author9=Rygel, M.C.  |last-author-amp=yes | year=2007 | title= CO2-forced climate and vegetation instability during late Paleozoic deglaciation| journal=Science | volume = 315 | pages =87–91 | doi= 10.1126/science.1134207 | pmid= 17204648 | issue= 5808 |bibcode = 2007Sci...315...87M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the exact speed and nature of the collapse is not clear, it is thought to have occurred relatively quickly in geologic terms, only a few thousand years at most.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Volcanism===
After restoring the middle of the [[Skagerrak-Centered Large Igneous Province]] (SCLIP) using a new reference frame, it has been shown that the [[Skagerrak]] [[Mantle plume|plume]] rose from the core–mantle boundary (CMB) to its ~300 Ma position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T.H. Torsvik |author2=M.A. Smethurst |author3=K. Burke |author4=B.

The rift formation coincides with the Moskovian/Kasimovian boundary and the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Vadim A. Kravchinsky | year=2012 | title=
Paleozoic large igneous provinces of Northern Eurasia: Correlation with mass extinction events | journal=Global and Planetary Change | volume = 86-87 | pages=31–36 |bibcode = 2012GPC....86...31K |doi = 10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple causes===
In recent years, scientists have suggested that many of Earth's largest [[extinction event]]s were due to multiple causes that coincided in time. Proponents suggest multiple causes because they see no single cause as sufficient in strength to cause the mass extinctions, or they believe that a single cause is unlikely to produce the taxonomic pattern of extinction. The specific cause of the Carboniferous rainforest collapse is not known, but a multiple cause scenario is plausible.

==Climate and geology==

A paleoclimate change of global nature occurred during the Moscovian and Kasimovian. An atmospheric drying (aridification) happened in the Middle to Late Pennsylvanian, coinciding with abrupt faunal changes in marine and terrestrial species.&lt;ref name="Gulbranson, EL; Montanez, IP; Tabor, NJ; Limarino, CO 2015 220–235"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Gulbranson, EL |author2=Montanez, IP |author3=Tabor, NJ |author4=Limarino, CO |title=Late Pennsylvanian aridification on the southwestern margin of Gondwana (Paganzo Basin, NW Argentina): A regional expression of a global climate perturbation  |year=2015 |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |pages=220–235| volume=417 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.10.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change was recorded in [[paleosol]]s, which reflect a period of overall decreased [[hydromorphy]], increased free-drainage and landscape stability, and a shift in the overall regional climate to drier conditions in the Upper Pennsylvanian (Missourian). This is consistent with climate interpretations based on contemporaneous paleo-floral assemblages and geological evidence.&lt;ref name="Gulbranson, EL; Montanez, IP; Tabor, NJ; Limarino, CO 2015 220–235"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Nicholasd|last=Rosenau|author2=Neil J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1717">A '''Clearing murder''' was a revenge killing of a known and popular [[Denmark|Dane]] in the last part of the German [[occupation of Denmark]] during World War II. When a [[Nazi Germany|German]] or Danish soldier or [[informant]] was killed by the [[Danish resistance movement]], the [[Peter group]] performed one or more clearing murder.

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], at some time in the latter half of 1944,  ordered that 10 civilians be killed each time a German soldier was killed by civilians. In Denmark, this was modified so that only one civilian was shot for one German soldier.

The first clearing murder was of famous author and priest [[Kaj Munk]] January 4, 1944. Subsequently, several doctors were murdered, including a senior consultant in [[Vejle]] and four doctors in [[Odense]]. In all, it is estimated that around one hundred people were killed in clearing murders.

Usually the clearing murders were done as street shooting in order to increase the [[terrorism|terror]] impact of [[fear]] and uncertainty in the general population. The aim was to turn the population against the Danish resistance movement. Doctors were especially vulnerable to clearing murders since they were out to look after the sick at any time of day.

The Germans demanded the Danish newspapers to print articles linking resistance killings and clearing murders next to each other on the same page.

'''Clementine Barnabet''' (1894? to at least 1923) was an African-American female serial killer. She committed murders in Louisiana and Texas, and was believed to have accomplices as part of a violent religious sect.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Initially suspicion fell on her father, but police investigation led to her being a suspect. She confessed to involvement in 35 murders. After a police investigation, she was convicted and imprisoned for her crimes. Barnabet escaped from prison and was not definitively known afterwards.

== Early life ==
Clementine Barnabet is believed to have been born around 1894 in St. Martinville, Louisiana and moved to Lafayette, Louisiana in 1909.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5M3-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=%22clementine+barnabet%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiojYPhnq7aAhUl1oMKHcAdAAoQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22clementine%20barnabet%22&amp;f=false|title=Dark Bayou: Infamous Louisiana Homicides|last=Gauthreaux|first=Alan G.|last2=Hippensteel|first2=D. G.|date=2015-11-16|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476662954|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born into a two-parent household and lived with her mother and father, Nina Porter and Raymond Barnabet.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; She had one brother, Zepherin Barnabet. When she was 17, she joined a cult called the [[Church of Sacrifice]] which prompted the start of the murders that she committed. Raymond Barnabet was reported to be abusive to his family and very aggressive.

== Killing patterns ==
The Barnabet killings followed a consistent pattern. Barnabet would often murder entire families rather than one singular person. The murders were all done with an axe. It was found that Barnabet would cut the heads off of the victims and once she had butchered the entire family, she would then lay their bodies in bed together and leave them to be found as such. Barnabet's killings occurred between Lafayette, Louisiana and Texas.

== Investigation ==
In February 1911, the first of many murders were committed.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Walter Byers and his family were murdered. This launched the investigation to determine the killer. The authorities' first suspect was Raymond Barnabet. Barnabet was the father of Clementine. The Barnabet family testified against Raymond, and they all recounted him leaving town that night for unknown reasons and returning home late with blood and brain matter on his shoes and shirt. Zepherin, Clementine's brother, stated that when he returned home, Raymond was bragging about the murders that he had committed and said that the family deserved it.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

During the time Raymond was being investigated, more killings occurred. In March 1911, the Cassaway family was murdered.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This caused a twist in the investigation because the family had a white mother, unlike the previous two families who were all black. Raymond was thought to have committed all three of these massacres and was soon arrested and sent to Lafayette Parish Jail.

While Barnabet was awaiting trial, another familicide took place. In November 1911, the Randall family was murdered in a manner similar to the previous slayings.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This confused authorities because it raised another suspect. The police then decided to investigate Clementine Barnabet.

== Arrest ==
In the Barnabet residence, a man's suit with blood and brain matter all over it was found in Clementine's closet. This prompted police to arrest Clementine Barnabet as a prime suspect, along with her father, of the numerous murders committed in the area. When initially arrested, Clementine denied all connections to the murders.

However, eventually Clementine admitted to 35 murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWI9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=%22clementine+barnabet%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiosqyRya7aAhXm6IMKHa_0BvIQ6AEISzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22clementine%20barnabet%22&amp;f=false|title=Index to Dates of Current Events Occurring Or Reported Jan. 1912-Dec. 1914|date=1913|publisher=R.R. Bowker Comapny|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explained her connection to the Church of Sacrifice, an offshoot of a [[Christ's Sanctified Holy Church]] congregation in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Clementine claimed that a priestess of the Church of Sacrifice had given her and her friends "conjure bags" (see [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]]) that would grant them supernatural powers and make them undetectable to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O6ZXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=%22clementine+barnabet%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiosqyRya7aAhXm6IMKHa_0BvIQ6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22clementine%20barnabet%22&amp;f=false|title=The American library annual 1911/12-1917/18: including list of American libraries of over 5000 volumes : libraries of Latin America : library schools and short courses : library and book-trade periodicals and organizations : book publication statistics, etc|date=1913|publisher=Office of the Publishers' weekly|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spurred Clementine into committing her first murder to test whether or not this was true.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Sentencing and disappearance ==
At only 18 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0w_DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT166&amp;dq=%22clementine+barnabet%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiosqyRya7aAhXm6IMKHa_0BvIQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22clementine%20barnabet%22&amp;f=false|title=Louisiana Ghost Stories: Tales of the Supernatural from the Bayou State|last=Wimberly|first=J.

In July 1913, she tried to escape jail but was caught before she even made it to the gate. However, in August 1923, Clementine Barnabet walked out of prison and was never seen or heard from again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is well suited to finding [[cluster analysis|clusters]] within data.

Models and algorithms based on the principle of competitive learning include [[vector quantization]] and [[self-organizing map]]s (Kohonen maps).

== Principles ==
There are three basic elements to a competitive learning rule:&lt;ref&gt;Rumelhart, David E., and David Zipser. "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog0901_5/pdf Feature discovery by competitive learning]." Cognitive science 9.1 (1985): 75-112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haykin, Simon, "Neural Network. A comprehensive foundation." Neural Networks 2.2004 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

* A set of neurons that are all the same except for some  randomly distributed synaptic weights, and which therefore respond differently to a given set  of input patterns
* A limit imposed on the "strength" of each neuron
* A mechanism that permits the neurons to compete for the right to respond to a given subset of inputs, such that only one output neuron (or only one neuron per group), is active (i.e. "on") at a time. The neuron that wins the competition is called a [[Winner-take-all (computing)|"winner-take-all" neuron]].

Accordingly, the individual neurons of the network learn to specialize on ensembles of similar patterns and in so doing become 'feature detectors' for different classes of input patterns.

The fact that competitive networks recode sets of correlated inputs to one of a few output neurons essentially removes the redundancy in representation which is an essential part of processing in biological [[sensory systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, Horace B. "Unsupervised learning." Neural computation 1.3 (1989): 295-311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmund T.. Rolls, and Gustavo Deco. Computational neuroscience of vision. Oxford: Oxford university press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture and implementation ==

[[File:Competitive neural network architecture.png|thumb|Competitive neural network architecture]]

Competitive Learning is usually implemented with Neural Networks that contain a hidden layer which is commonly known as “competitive layer”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jsalatas.ictpro.gr/implementation-of-competitive-learning-networks-for-weka/ |title=Implementation of Competitive Learning Networks for WEKA |author=Salatas, John |date= 24 August 2011|work= |publisher= ICT Research Blog|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every competitive neuron is described by a vector of weights &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{w}}_i = \left( {w_{i1} ,..,w_{id} } \right)^T ,i = 1,..,M&lt;/math&gt; and calculates the [[similarity measure]] between the input data &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{x}}^n = \left( {x_{n1} ,..,x_{nd} } \right)^T \in \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;  and the weight vector &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{w}}_i&lt;/math&gt; .

For every input vector, the competitive neurons “compete” with each other to see which one of them is the most similar to that particular input vector. The winner neuron m sets its output &lt;math&gt;o_m = 1&lt;/math&gt; and all the other competitive neurons set their output  &lt;math&gt;o_i = 0 , i = 1,..,M, i \ne m&lt;/math&gt;.

Usually, in order to measure similarity the inverse of the Euclidean distance is used: &lt;math&gt;\left\| {{\mathbf{x}} - {\mathbf{w}}_i } \right\|&lt;/math&gt; between the input vector &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{x}}^n&lt;/math&gt; and the weight vector &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{w}}_i&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example algorithm ==

Here is a simple competitive learning algorithm to find three clusters within some input data.

1. (Set-up.) Let a set of sensors all feed into three different nodes, so that every node is connected to every sensor.  Let the weights that each node gives to its sensors be set randomly between 0.0 and 1.0.  Let the output of each node be the sum of all its sensors, each sensor's signal strength being multiplied by its weight.

2. When the net is shown an input, the node with the highest output is deemed the winner. The input is classified as being within the cluster corresponding to that node.

3. The winner updates each of its weights, moving weight from the connections that gave it weaker signals to the connections that gave it stronger signals.

Thus, as more data are received, each node converges on the centre of the cluster that it has come to represent and activates more strongly for inputs in this cluster and more weakly for inputs in other clusters.

The '''Custer Wolf''' was a North American [[gray wolf]] who was held responsible for extensive damage to ranchers' livestock in the area surrounding [[Custer, South Dakota]], between 1911 and 1920, with the damage estimated at $25,000. The wolf was shot by a hunter employed by the federal government, who tracked the wolf for months and killed him after the wolf had sprung a trap.

== Legend of the Custer Wolf  ==
Responsible for the death of $25,000 (equivalent to roughly $300,000 in 2016) worth of horses, cattle, and calves, the wolf eluded professional hunters, [[sportsmen]], and [[Bounty hunter|bounty-hunters]] alike for nine years, during which time the bounty on his head increased from $100 to $500, ten times the usual price of a normal wolf at the time.&lt;ref name=merrit/&gt; Until H.P. Williams, an experienced hunter, killed the wolf, no hunts were successful; one tracked the wolf for five years before giving up. Local folklore added greatly to the mystery and hysteria surrounding the wolf. Locals claimed that he was not just a wolf but a "monstrosity of nature",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|last=Stokes|first=C.E.|newspaper=The Golden West|volume=2|year=1920|title=A Master Crook of the Animal World|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7hEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a wolf and a [[mountain lion]]. The wolf had escaped death so many times that the ranchers of the area believed that they would have to endure their livestock losses until the wolf died of natural causes.

The wolf reportedly killed more than he needed to survive; in one week he killed more than 30 cattle, castrating and mutilating them. One newspaper even called the wolf "The cruelest, most sagacious, and most successful animal outlaw";&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, Bruce. The Great American Wolf. New York: H. Holt, 1997. Print. p.2. &lt;/ref&gt; another author called him "the master criminal of the animal world".&lt;ref name=merrit&gt;{{cite web|last=Merrit|first=Dixon|title=World's Greatest Animal Dead|publisher=US Department of Agriculture Division of Publications|date=January 7, 1921|accessdate=April 26, 2017|url=https://www.fws.gov/news/Historic/NewsReleases/1921/19210103.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that four years prior to the beginning of his rampage, his mate and their pups were killed, and that the wolf never took another mate or joined another pack: popular belief of the townspeople of Custer held that the wolf was seeking vengeance against the humans that had killed his mate and pups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hampton|first=Bruce|title=The Great American Wolf|location=New York|publisher=Henry Holt|year=1997|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal involvement== 
In 1911, 55 gray wolves were killed in the South Dakota Black Hills, with bounties paid. In 1915, 8 more were killed; in 1916, 5 more. A pregnant wolf and her four pups were killed in 1917, and what was possibly her mate was killed in 1920.&lt;ref name=island&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chPaiVcKissC&amp;pg=PA210|title=Island in the Plains: A Black Hills Natural History|page=210|first=Edward|last=Raventon|publisher=Big Earth|isbn=9781555663261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the buffalo and other game to prey on, wolves had to adapt to changing circumstances; they did so by attacking livestock. Many wolves were simply poisoned with [[strychnine]]; others were shot in a large federally funded eradication program, which between 1915 and 1920 employed over 300 hunters, who killed a staggering number of animals: 110,000 coyotes, 15,000 bobcats and lynxes, 3,000 wolves&lt;!--over what area?--&gt;. Counting those killed by poison, the total exceeded 250,000.&lt;ref name=jim&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Field &amp; Stream]]|first=Jim|last=Merritt|title=The Custer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2Ujg7qsO-kC&amp;pg=PA104|pages=43–44, 101–104|accessdate=May 2, 2017|date=March 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To kill the Custer Wolf, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] sent top federal hunter H.P. Williams, who was ordered to stay in South Dakota until the wolf was dead. Williams was credited with trapping and killing over a thousand wolves across the [[Western United States]] from the late 19th century to the mid-1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, Bruce (1997). The Great American Wolf. New York: Henry Holt. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==H.P. Williams's hunt==
Williams arrived in April 1920. The wolf had been known to travel in an area of {{convert|300|sqmi}} in southern South Dakota, and had even been seen in parts of [[Wyoming]] and [[Nebraska]]. When Williams first saw the Custer Wolf he was unable to get a clear shot, but along the way, he realized that two [[coyote]]s had allied themselves with the wolf: though keeping a distance from the much larger wolf, the two coyotes would often eat the wolf's leftovers. Reportedly, the two coyotes would travel ahead at the flanks of the wolf and warn him of any danger ahead. Williams realized this and decided to shoot and kill both coyotes in hopes of being able to get a clear shot, and the deaths of the coyotes did indeed spook the wolf.&lt;ref name=weekly/&gt;

After coming close on a number of occasions throughout the summer of 1920, Williams did not see the wolf for almost the entire month of August; in early September, a trap Williams had laid ripped some hair off the wolf's paw. He tracked the wolf again when [[livestock]] attacks resumed in early September. After eluding Williams for yet another month, the Custer Wolf stepped on a trap one mid-October morning. The wolf ran with it for about {{convert|150|yd}} until getting caught on a tree, breaking the swivel of the trap. The severely injured wolf left an easy trail, and Williams shot him after trailing him for {{convert|3|mi}}, on October 11.&lt;ref name=weekly&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Weekly News Letter|pages=1, 16|title=Widely Famous Custer Wolf Hits the Long, Long Trail|date=January 26, 1921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iq07AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA334|accessdate=May 2, 2017|volume=8|publisher=US Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Custer Wolf was shot seven months after Williams arrived in South Dakota. To the surprise of many residents of Custer, the animal they had thought a monstrosity of nature was just a normal North American gray wolf, {{convert|98|lb}} heavy and just over {{convert|6|ft}} in length. The wolf was so aged that his pelt had turned white. Williams noted that the wolf's teeth would have been strong enough to hunt for another 15 years. In an interview, Williams gave 40 years after leaving South Dakota, he spoke of the great respect that he had for the wolf for giving him the most difficult hunt of his career. In total, the Custer Wolf killed more than 500 livestock and horses, worth around $25,000,&lt;ref name=island/&gt;&lt;ref name=weekly/&gt; or ${{inflation|US|25000|1920|fmt=c|r=-4}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars.{{Inflation-fn|US}}

==Legacy==
In 1966, wildlife writer [[Roger A. Caras]] published a book called ''The Custer Wolf'', which tells the story of a family of wolves in the Custer area through the eyes of one of the wolves. Beginning in a world of natural harmony, the wolves' lives and those of all other animals are disturbed when iron ore from Michigan and coal from Pennsylvania are turned into guns and traps; strychnine is imported from India, all to make war on the wolf. The book ends with H.P. Williams's reflection on the animals he killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4659pXl4g1oC&amp;pg=PA106|page=106|accessdate=May 2, 2017|year=1991|title=Saving America's Wildlife|first=Thomas R.|last=Dunlap|isbn=9780691006130|publisher=Princeton UP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4096">'''Darwin''' was a [[programming game]] invented in August 1961 by [[Victor A. Vyssotsky]], [[Robert Morris Sr.]], and [[M. Douglas McIlroy]].  ([[Dennis Ritchie]] is sometimes incorrectly cited as a co-author, but was not involved.)  The game was developed at [[Bell Labs]], and played on an [[IBM 7090]] mainframe there.  The game was only played for a few weeks before Morris developed an "ultimate" program that eventually brought the game to an end, as no-one managed to produce anything that could defeat it.

==Description==
The game consisted of a program called the ''umpire'' and a designated section of the computer's memory known as the ''arena'', into which two or more small programs, written by the players, were loaded.  The programs were written in 7090 [[machine code]], and could call a number of functions provided by the umpire in order to probe other locations within the arena, kill opposing programs, and claim vacant memory for copies of themselves.

The game ended after a set amount of time, or when copies of only one program remained alive.  The player who wrote the last surviving program was declared winner.

Up to 20 memory locations within each program (fewer in later versions of the game) could be designated as ''protected''.  If one of these protected locations was probed by another program, the umpire would immediately transfer control to the program that was probed.  This program would then continue to execute until it, in turn, probed a protected location of some other program, and so forth.

While the programs were responsible for copying and [[Relocation (computer science)|relocating]] themselves, they were forbidden from altering memory locations outside themselves without permission from the umpire.  As the programs were executed directly by the computer, there was no physical mechanism in place to prevent cheating.  Instead, the [[source code]] for the programs was made available for study after each game, allowing players to learn from each other and to verify that their opponents hadn't cheated.

The smallest program that could reproduce, locate enemies and kill them consisted of about 30 instructions.  McIlroy developed a 15-instruction program that could locate and kill enemies but not reproduce; while not very lethal, it was effectively unkillable, as it was shorter than the limit of 20 protected instructions.  In later games the limit on protected instructions was lowered because of this.

The "ultimately lethal" program developed by Morris had 44 instructions, and employed an adaptive strategy.  Once it successfully located the start of an enemy program, it would probe some small distance ahead of this location.  If it succeeded in killing the enemy, it would remember the distance and use it on subsequent encounters.  If it instead hit a protected location, then the next time it gained control it chose a different distance.  Any new copies were initialized with a successful value.  In this way, Morris's program evolved into multiple subspecies, each specifically adapted to kill a particular enemy.

'''Jeremiah Joseph Duggan''' (10 November 1980 – 27 March 2003) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[student]] in [[Paris]] who died during a visit to [[Wiesbaden]], [[Germany]], after being struck by several cars on a [[dual carriageway]]. The circumstances of his death became a matter of dispute because at the time he died Duggan was attending a youth "cadre" school organised by the [[LaRouche movement]], an international network led by the [[United States|American]] political activist [[Lyndon LaRouche]].&lt;ref name=Mueller19Nov2015/&gt;

The German police concluded that Duggan had committed [[suicide]] after running several kilometres from the apartment in which he had been staying, then jumping in front of early-morning traffic. A British [[coroner]] rejected a suicide verdict in 2003 after hearing the [[London]] [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] describe the LaRouche movement as a political [[cult]]. Duggan telephoned his mother, Erica Duggan, 50 minutes before he died, apparently distressed about his involvement in it.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Hugh. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jul/12/politics.students "Mystery death of anti-war student"], ''The Guardian'', 12 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby28Aug2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, Terry. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/coroner-denounces-cult-suicide-claim-76795.html "Coroner denounces cult suicide claim"], ''The Independent'', 4 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Hugh. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/nov/05/politics.students "British student did not commit suicide, says coroner"], ''The Guardian'', 5 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing that the German police had not investigated the case thoroughly, Erica commissioned [[forensic]] reports which suggested the car accident might have been staged and that Duggan had died elsewhere. After protracted [[litigation]] in the UK and Germany, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London ordered a second inquest in 2010,&lt;ref name=BBCMay202010&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/8694448.stm "Fresh inquest into student death"], BBC News, 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012 the Frankfurt [[Oberlandesgericht|Higher Regional Court]] ordered the Wiesbaden police to reopen their investigation.&lt;ref name=Mueller19Nov2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmale18May2014/&gt; In 2015 the coroner upheld that Duggan had been killed in the accident, but rejected a suicide verdict, adding that unexplained injuries suggested an "altercation at some stage before his death."&lt;ref name=Taylor21May2015(2)&gt;Taylor, Matthew.

The LaRouche movement attributed criticism of its involvement in the case to LaRouche's political opponents, including former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and former [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. vice president]] [[Dick Cheney]], who they say sought to discredit LaRouche over his opposition to the 2003 [[Iraq War]] and his criticism of the [[Attribution of recent climate change|anthropogenic global-warming theory]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steinberg, Jeffrey|url=http://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2005/2005_10-19/2005_10-19/2005-11/pdf/40-42_11_intduggan.pdf|title=Behind the Kelly/Wilson/Duggan Affair: Anatomy of a Defamation Campaign|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106112310/http://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2005/2005_10-19/2005_10-19/2005-11/pdf/40-42_11_intduggan.pdf |archive-date=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London 'Friends of Dick Cheney and Al Gore' Behind New Slander of LaRouche|url=http://www.larouchepac.com/pages/press_releases_files/2007/0327_smear.shtml|date=March 25, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427131245/http://www.larouchepac.com/pages/press_releases_files/2007/0327_smear.shtml|archive-date=April 27, 2007|publisher=''Executive Intelligence Review''|pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, Tim.

From the 1970s the movement became associated with the promotion of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], and at times with the use of violence against opponents, the fraudulent use of donations, and [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name=Witt24Oct2004/&gt;{{rp|37–39}}&lt;ref name=Clemente2003&gt;Ciment, Jim.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/larouche/main.htm "Ideological Odyssey: From Old Left to Far Right"], ''The Washington Post'', 14 January 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; There was criticism of its recruitment methods. According to ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', recruits were isolated from their families, encouraged to give up their studies, and subjected to intense verbal pressure before being asked to accept the LaRouche worldview.&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004&gt;Smith, David James.

LaRouche was particularly critical of Britain and of the [[Tavistock Institute]] in London, a [[psychotherapy]] and [[social sciences]] charity that the movement associated with [[British intelligence]].&lt;ref name=Witt24Oct2004/&gt;{{rp|40}}&lt;ref name=Kirby21July2004&gt;Kirby, Terry.

==Duggan's involvement with the movement==

===''Nouvelle Solidarité''===
[[File:Colloque wikimedia décembre 2010 - image d'illustration - 004.JPG|thumb|alt=photograph|Duggan bought a LaRouche newspaper outside the [[Invalides (Paris Métro and RER)|Invalides]] station on the [[Paris Métro]].]]
Duggan's first contact with the LaRouche movement was in Paris in January 2003, when he bought a copy of the LaRouche French-language newspaper, ''Nouvelle Solidarité'', from a booth near the British Institute, outside the [[Invalides (Paris Métro and RER)|Invalides]] station on the [[Paris Métro]]. The man who sold him the paper was Benoit Chalifoux, a writer for the newspaper and one of the movement's "organizers" or recruiters.&lt;ref name=Nordhausen11May2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt;

Duggan was intensely opposed to the Iraq War, as were Chalifoux and his group of friends from the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Osmond, "Lost Abroad: The Parents' Story," ''Cutting Edge'', Channel 4, 1 April 2010, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Lb0lxiQcc 2/5], 00:01:28 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqJPAIu25fU 1/5], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxBp7wftCs 3/5], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_a6DbX9_KA 4/5], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlkB4GtBihE 5/5]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protests against the Iraq War|Protests]] were taking place all over the world in the weeks leading up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] on 20 March 2003. Duggan began seeing more of Chalifoux's group and was invited to attend a Schiller Institute conference near Wiesbaden, the LaRouche movement's [[Europe]]an headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Channel 4 ''Cutting Edge'', 1 April 2010, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Lb0lxiQcc 2/5], 00:05:40–00:07:10.&lt;/ref&gt; Duggan and his parents believed it was an anti-war conference. His mother searched for material about LaRouche on the web in vain, possibly she or her son misspelled the name as "Laroche."&lt;ref name=Kirby28Aug2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt;

===Conference===
Duggan and Chalifoux travelled to Wiesbaden on 21 March with eight other men.&lt;ref name=Kirby28Aug2003/&gt; Duggan stayed in a youth [[hostel]] at first, then with two other recruits in an apartment belonging to two Schiller Institute managers.&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt;

The conference, "How to Reconstruct a Bankrupt World," was held in [[Bad Schwalbach]], near Wiesbaden, from 21 to 23 March. LaRouche was the keynote speaker, with a speech entitled "Physical Geometry as Strategy."&lt;ref name=Kirby28Aug2003/&gt; According to April Witt in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', he told the audience that [[George W. Bush]] was an unreformed drunk, [[Woodrow Wilson]] had founded the [[Ku Klux Klan]] from the [[White House]], [[John F. Kennedy]] was killed by a domestic American operation, and the US was using the war in Iraq to "ignite catastrophic global warfare."&lt;ref name=Witt24Oct2004/&gt;{{rp|39–40}} The plot to launch a [[world war]] was being influenced, he said, by people who "like [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], admire [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], but being Jewish&amp;nbsp;... couldn't qualify for [[Nazi Party]] leadership, even though their fascism was absolutely pure! As extreme as Hitler! They sent them to the United States." The people behind the plot were the "independent central-banking-system crowd, the slime-mold," he said, the same people who had brought Hitler to power in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Witt24Oct2004&gt;Witt, April.

===Youth cadre school===
After the conference, Duggan attended a [[LaRouche Youth Movement]] cadre school in Wiesbaden with 60–70 others. Chalifoux, the recruiter who had accompanied him to Germany, returned to Paris.&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt; According to another potential recruit, there were hours of lectures, seminars and one-on-one meetings every day, as well as chanting and singing.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Matthew. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/20/jeremiah-duggan-inquest-germany-suicide "Student Jeremiah Duggan feared he was in trouble before 'suicide', says mother"], ''The Guardian'', 20 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duggan reportedly stood out because he was British and Jewish.&lt;ref name=Witt24Oct2004/&gt;{{rp|40}} A document from the London [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], submitted to the first inquest, said the Schiller Institute and LaRouche Youth Movement blamed the Jewish people for the Iraq war and other global issues, and that "Jeremiah's lecture notes and bulletins showed the anti-Semitic nature of [the] ideology."&lt;ref name="BBC Newsnight 12 February 2004, 00:02:23"&gt;BBC ''Newsnight'', 12 February 2004, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqmvTP70g7A 3/3], 00:02:23.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Duggan's mother, the Schiller Institute's scientific adviser, Dr. Jonathan Tennenbaum, told her that when Duggan heard the Jews being blamed for the war during a seminar, he had stood up and said, "But I'm a Jew!"&lt;ref name=Kirby28Aug2003/&gt; One participant said the others put him "through the wringer" because of it.&lt;ref name=Nordhausen4April2007&gt;{{de icon}} Nordhausen, Frank.

According to Witt, Duggan may have been placed under further pressure because he told the others he had attended the [[Tavistock Clinic]] as a child for counselling when his parents divorced. Duggan's conference notes showed that someone at the conference referred to the Tavistock as a "[[brainwashing]]" centre.&lt;ref name=Witt24Oct2004/&gt;{{rp|40}}

==Incident==

===Visit to Frankfurt===
[[File:Frankfurt Staedel Museum dk3227.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=photograph|[[Städel]] museum, Frankfurt]]
Duggan and his French girlfriend had planned to meet in Paris on Tuesday, 25 March.&lt;ref name=Kirby28Aug2003/&gt; Instead he called her that day, two days before his death, to say he had no money for the fare home and was unable to get a ride until Sunday. He told her "very serious things" were happening and that he would explain when he returned.&lt;ref name=Witt24Oct2004/&gt;{{rp|40}}

On 26 March he accompanied LaRouche members to [[Frankfurt]] to hand out LaRouche literature in the streets, then to see the [[Rembrandt]] collection at the [[Städel]] museum. When one member asked what he thought of it, he started crying. The woman invited him to step outside for some air. He kept repeating that he did not trust LaRouche, and said he wanted to go back to England. She told him he was free to leave and could phone her if he wanted to, which seemed to reassure him. She last saw him with one of his roommates sitting on the steps of the museum around 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=Witt24Oct2004/&gt;{{rp|40}}&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Channel 4 ''Cutting Edge'', 1 April 2010, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxBp7wftCs 3/5], 00:06:25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duggan's telephone calls===
One of the Schiller Institute managers in whose apartment Duggan was staying told ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that he and his roommate got back to the house around midnight. They had no key so the manager opened the door for them. According to the roommate (speaking after Duggan's death to Duggan's girlfriend), Duggan could not sleep and kept switching the lights on and off. He said he was unable to trust LaRouche and felt trapped.&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt;

At around 4:20&amp;nbsp;am—by now Thursday, 27 March—Duggan called his girlfriend on the roommate's [[mobile phone]]. She said he was speaking very quietly, sounded agitated and confused, complaining that he no longer knew what was true and real, and that someone was conducting experiments with computers and magnetic waves, perhaps on him. She asked him to take a train to Paris in the morning.&lt;ref name=Witt24Oct2004/&gt;{{rp|40}}&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC ''Newsnight'', 12 February 2004, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpSx8K0U21A 1/3], 00:05:10; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK1zxZmK4gs 2/3], 00:00:00 mins.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the roommate, Duggan then telephoned his mother, after which he ran out of the house.&lt;ref name=Foggo9Nov2003/&gt; Mrs. Duggan said the first call came at 5:24&amp;nbsp;am German time (4:24&amp;nbsp;am in the UK):

&lt;blockquote&gt;And he said, "Mum, I'm in&amp;nbsp;... big trouble&amp;nbsp;... You know this ''Nouvelle Solidarité''?"&amp;nbsp;... He said, "I can't do this&amp;nbsp;... I want out." And at that point the phone was cut. And then it rang back again almost immediately. And the first thing that he said that time was, "Mum, I'm frightened." I realised he was in such danger that I said to him, "I love you." And then he said, "I want to see you ''now''."&amp;nbsp;... I said, "Well, where are you, Jerry?" He said, "Wiesbaden." And I said, "How do you spell it?" And he said, "W-I-E-S." And then the phone was cut.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]] [[BBC Newsnight|''Newsnight'']], 12 February 2004, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK1zxZmK4gs 2/3], 00:02:08.{{pb}}

After the calls, according to the roommate, Duggan asked, "Why did you choose me?" and said he wanted to go out for a cigarette. The roommate went too but pressed a doorbell by accident while looking for the light switch at the bottom of the stairs; he said this appeared to make Duggan panic and he ran off.&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt; He said he ran after Duggan briefly before going back to the apartment.&lt;ref name=Kirby28Aug2003/&gt;

Just over thirty minutes later, at about 6:00&amp;nbsp;am, two drivers heading into Wiesbaden [[town centre]] saw a man run toward them on the Berliner Straße ([[Bundesstraße 455]]), a four-lane [[dual carriageway]].&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nordhausen4April2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duggan v Attorney General 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;179–181}} The spot, near an [[Aral AG|Aral]] garage, was around five kilometres (c.&amp;nbsp;three miles) from the apartment in which Duggan had been staying, and not far from the LaRouche offices in the Wiesbaden suburb of [[Erbenheim]].&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC ''Newsnight'', 12 February 2004, from 00:01:38.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the drivers said Duggan ran toward him with outstretched arms.&lt;ref name=Nordhausen11May2004/&gt; The car, a [[BMW]], clipped him with the wing mirror. He appears to have fallen, but got up and continued running toward the traffic that was heading into town.&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt; Both drivers reported the incidents to police.&lt;ref name="Duggan v Attorney General 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;181}}

At 6:14&amp;nbsp;am, as the police were taking details, they were told that a man had run into a red [[Peugeot]] further ahead on the same road.&lt;ref name="Duggan v Attorney General 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;181}} The driver saw Duggan move onto the road in front of him. The car swerved from the inside lane to the outside, but the driver said Duggan leapt in front of the car, arms raised and mouth open. The car hit him, denting the passenger door and shattering the passenger window and windscreen, and throwing Duggan into the path of a blue [[Volkswagen Golf]], which ran over him.&lt;ref name="Duggan v Attorney General 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;179–180}} He was certified dead at the scene at 6:35&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name=Witt24Oct2004/&gt;{{rp|41}}

The view of the German police was that Duggan had arrived at that stretch of road after running 5&amp;nbsp;km from the apartment.&lt;ref name=Degen19April2007/&gt; Duggan's family complained that the police had failed to establish that. Other allegations included that he had spent the night at the nearby LaRouche offices and ran from there to the road,&lt;ref name=Schmale18May2014/&gt; and that he had run onto the road from a car.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Lorscheid, Helmut. [http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/16/16074/1.html "Tod auf der Schnellstraße"], ''Heise Online'', 14 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forensic]] reports commissioned by Erica Duggan suggested that he may have died elsewhere and been moved onto the road after the fact, a position the [[coroner]] rejected in 2015.&lt;ref name=Taylor21May2015(2)/&gt;

===Early response===
Within minutes of Duggan's second telephone call to her, Erica contacted the British emergency services and was advised to call her local police station in [[Colindale]], [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]]. She told them she believed her son was in danger. They transferred her to the Metropolitan Police at [[Scotland Yard]], but when she explained he had become involved with ''Nouvelle Solidarité'' they had no idea what she meant.&lt;ref name=Kirby28Aug2003/&gt;

At 7:40&amp;nbsp;am Duggan's roommate telephoned his girlfriend in Paris to ask if she had heard from him; he said Duggan had left the apartment and had not returned.&lt;ref name=inquest2003&gt;{{cite news|title=Partial inquest transcript|url=http://www.justiceforjeremiah.com/inquest.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217223150/http://www.justiceforjeremiah.com/inquest.html|archive-date=December 17, 2005|author=HM Coroner for Northern District of Greater London, Hornsey, 6 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 11&amp;nbsp;am Erica rang the roommate's mobile phone; because he did not speak English, he passed it to a Schiller Institute manager. The manager reportedly told her the group was [[Executive Intelligence Review|a news agency]], adding, "We cannot take responsibility for the actions of individuals. We think your son has psychological problems."&lt;ref name=Kirby28Aug2003/&gt; She said she would call the local hospitals to see whether Duggan had been admitted. Shortly after this, the manager and Duggan's roommate, along with another member, handed his [[passport]], bag and rucksack to the Wiesbaden police station.&lt;ref name=Foggo9Nov2003&gt;Foggo, Daniel. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1446301/German-police-probe-into-British-students-death-was-inadequate.html "German police probe into British student's death was 'inadequate'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 9 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The manager told ''[[The Independent]]'': "I believed he had psychological problems, based on the conversations he had with people. I don't know what happened on the night he died, but the Schiller Institute played no part in his death."&lt;ref name=Kirby28Aug2003/&gt; The police report stated that the manager told them Erica had called "since he had severe [[asthma]] and was not getting in touch with her." Later Erica said her son had not had asthma since childhood.&lt;ref name=Foggo9Nov2003/&gt;

According to one of those present, around 25 members of the movement were asked to assemble in the local LaRouche office that morning, in a meeting attended by Helga Zepp-LaRouche. They were told that Duggan had killed himself. A LaRouche recruiter from Paris told the meeting that Duggan had been to the Tavistock, apparently giving the impression that he had been there recently. Zepp-LaRouche reportedly said that Duggan might have been sent from London to harm LaRouche.&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt;

==Inquiries==

===First German investigation===
Wiesbaden police reportedly concluded within three hours that Duggan committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=Nordhausen4April2007/&gt; LaRouche officials were said to have told police that Duggan had been a patient at the Tavistock and had suffered from "suicidal impulses."&lt;ref name=Witt24Oct2004/&gt;{{rp|41}} That view of him shaped the rest of the inquiry, according to ''The Sunday Times''.&lt;ref name=Smith18July2004/&gt;

An emergency doctor gave the cause of death as "open, cranio-cerebral trauma following traffic accident,"&lt;ref name="Duggan v Attorney General 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;182}} injuries that he said were consistent with the accident as described by the drivers.&lt;ref name=Degen13June2015&gt;{{de icon}} Degen, Wolfgang.

The Germans did not conduct an [[autopsy]], because the cause of death had been established and there was no evidence of [[Crime|foul play]].&lt;ref name=Degen13June2015/&gt; His clothes were not returned to his family and were assumed to have been destroyed.&lt;ref name=Foggo9Nov2003/&gt; The police took no formal witness statements.&lt;ref name=Capon18May2015/&gt; Witness evidence was recorded as "brief, sometimes contradictory, notes," according to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name=Foggo9Nov2003/&gt; Nothing suggested that the drivers had any connection to the LaRouche movement or Duggan.&lt;ref name="Duggan v Attorney General 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;192}} The prosecutor closed the case after three months.&lt;ref name=Capon18May2015/&gt; In 2004 Dieter Arlett, the Wiesbaden public prosecutor, told the BBC:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are 100 percent certain that it is suicide, suicide as we call it, that as a consequence of his own behaviour, and with no one else involved, he threw himself in front of a car, of several cars, and died on the third attempt.&lt;ref&gt;BBC ''Newsnight'', 12 February 2004, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK1zxZmK4gs 2/3], 00:02:37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under German law, Arlett said that he could investigate further only if there existed "concrete evidence of third-party involvement," and there was none; the Schiller Institute had been mentioned in connection with the death only because Duggan had attended an event of theirs.&lt;ref&gt;BBC ''Newsnight'', 12 February 2004, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqmvTP70g7A 3/3], 00:04:16.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials maintained the same position in 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref name=Degen19April2007&gt;{{de icon}} Degen, Wolfgang.

Duggan's body was flown back to England on 31 March 2003, where a non-forensic post-mortem examination was conducted on 4 April by [[pathologist]] David Shove.&lt;ref name="Skeleton argument 2008"&gt;Hyam, Jeremy.

Shove was not called to attend the [[inquest]], which took place in November 2003.&lt;ref name="Skeleton argument 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;34}} Robert Hawthorne, an accident investigator, told the court that Duggan may only have appeared to leap in front of the cars: "The drivers may have perceived that he leapt when in actual fact he was either running to clear the cars or what they saw was the post-impact movement of Jeremiah as he was flung around."&lt;ref name=inquest2003/&gt; The court heard testimony about the conference Duggan had attended. A Metropolitan Police memo was entered as evidence: "The Schiller Institute and the LaRouche Youth Movement&amp;nbsp;... blames the Jewish people for the Iraq war and all the other problems in the world. Jeremiah's lecture notes and bulletins showed the anti-Semitic nature of [the] ideology."&lt;ref name="BBC Newsnight 12 February 2004, 00:02:23"/&gt; The coroner, Dr. [[William Dolman]], delivered a [[narrative verdict]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jeremiah Joseph Duggan received fatal head injuries when he ran into the road in Wiesbaden and was hit by two private motor cars. What other fact do we know that I must add? I really must add that he had earlier been in a state of terror. It is a word not commonly used in a Coroner's court but no other word would reflect his state of mind at the time.&lt;ref name="Skeleton argument 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;7}}&lt;ref name=PA7Nov2003&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/nov/07/students.education "Student died 'in state of terror'"], Press Association, 7 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Private forensic reviews===
Erica set up the "Justice for Jeremiah" campaign in April 2004 with legal support from the [[British Foreign Office]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3588715.stm "Mother to get Foreign Office help"], BBC News, 1 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Hugh. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/02/students.politics "FO steps up pressure over student's death"], ''The Guardian'', 2 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 she hand-delivered a list of questions to Shove, the pathologist who had performed the autopsy.&lt;ref name=Capon18May2015/&gt; When she showed him Duggan's autopsy report, he allegedly replied that Duggan had been "severely beaten around the head" and said he had not realised it had been a traffic accident.&lt;ref name=Nordhausen4April2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duggan v Attorney General 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;81}} Shove declined to sign a statement to that effect and apparently could not be located for the second inquest.&lt;ref name="Duggan v Attorney General 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;222}}&lt;ref name=Capon18May2015/&gt;

Six forensic experts hired by Erica examined Shove's autopsy report and photographs taken by accident investigators in Wiesbaden.&lt;ref name=Townsend25March2007&gt;Townsend, Mark; Doward, Jamie. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/mar/25/world.germany "New evidence shows 'suicide' student was beaten to death"], ''The Observer'', 25 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6500000/newsid_6501200/6501231.stm?bw=nb&amp;mp=wm&amp;news=1&amp;nol_storyid=6501231&amp;bbcws=1 "Student beaten to death"], BBC News, 27 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor20May2015&gt;Taylor, Matthew.

[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/17/ukcrime.germany "Cult riddle of student's death"], ''The Observer'', 17 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Two other forensic experts expressed similar views.&lt;ref name="Skeleton argument 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;35}}

Those views were challenged during a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] hearing in 2008 regarding the application for a new inquest. Contrary to the claim that there was no sign that Duggan had come into contact with the cars, there were "traces on the underside of the Golf," according to Cecilia Ivimy on behalf of the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]].&lt;ref name="Duggan v Attorney General 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;235}} She described the argument that the accident had been staged as requiring someone to have inflicted head injuries after the phone call to Erics, placed Duggan on the road, inflicted damage to two cars, scattered debris, and created skid marks, all without attracting attention.&lt;ref name="Duggan v Attorney General 2008"/&gt;{{rp|¶&amp;nbsp;196}} In 2010 the [[Bundesverfassungsgericht|Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] called the allegations outlandish.{{refn|group=n|"Eine solche Möglichkeit halte der Senat für abwegig."&lt;ref name=Bundesverfassungsgericht/&gt;}} The ''[[Wiesbadener Kurier]]'' criticised what it saw as the defamation of "two completely innocent motorists."&lt;ref name=Degen13June2015/&gt;

===Second British inquest===

===Second German investigation===
[[File:OLG Frankfurt.png|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=photograph|[[Oberlandesgericht]] in Frankfurt]]
Duggan's family appealed unsuccessfully in 2006 to the [[Oberlandesgericht|Higher Regional Court]] in Frankfurt regarding the decision to close the German police investigation. Their appeal against that decision was rejected by Germany's Federal Constitutional Court in 2010.&lt;ref name=Bundesverfassungsgericht&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rk20100204_2bvr230706.html ''In dem Verfahren über die Verfassungsbeschwerde der Frau D&amp;nbsp;...''], Bundesverfassungsgericht, 2 BvR 2307/06, 4 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second appeal to the Oberlandesgericht succeeded in 2012.&lt;ref name=Mueller19Nov2015&gt;{{de icon}} Müller, Daniel. [http://www.zeit.de/2015/45/justiz-skandal-larouche-jeremiah-duggan/komplettansicht "Warum starb Jeremiah?"], ''Die Zeit'', 19 November 2015 ([https://www.webcitation.org/6hUNEgVQX?url=http://justiceforjeremiah.yolasite.com/ translation]; translation archived at ).&lt;/ref&gt; In what the ''[[Berliner Zeitung]]'' described as an extremely unusual decision, the court ordered the Wiesbaden prosecutor to re-open the inquiry. The court said that a pedestrian leaving the LaRouche offices in Wiesbaden, in the direction of the town centre, would have reached exactly that junction in the Berliner Straße, and "would have had to cross the four-lane road if he did not want or was unable to turn back."&lt;ref name=Schmale18May2014&gt;{{de icon}} Schmale, Holger.

==LaRouche response==
In 2006 LaRouche issued a statement saying the allegations were a [[hoax]] stemming from a campaign orchestrated by [[Dick Cheney]], then [[Vice President of the United States]], and Cheney's wife [[Lynne Cheney|Lynne]].&lt;ref&gt;LaRouche, Lyndon H. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070213031916/http://www.larouchepac.com/pages/press_releases_files/2006/1109_duggan.html "Duggan Hoax Rewarmed Again"], LaRouche Political Action Committee, 8 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the LaRouche movement published a letter from the Metropolitan Police, dated 14 July 2003, that it said was obtained under the British [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]], in which an officer wrote that he had been assured the case had been fully investigated in Germany.&lt;ref name=SchillerSept2007/&gt;

The Schiller Institute issued a statement in 2007: "The Schiller Institute has always maintained that it had no involvement whatsoever in Jeremiah's death, and has expressed its sympathy to the Duggan family."&lt;ref name=SchillerSept2007&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013222239/http://schillerinstitute.org/exon/070927_duggan_facts.html "The Facts in the Jeremiah Duggan Case"], Schiller Institute, September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 a spokesperson told ''Newsweek'' that the allegations were "utterly preposterous":

&lt;blockquote&gt;At no time has Ms Duggan ever presented any evidence or facts that refute the findings of the German authorities concerning the suicide of her son. Instead, over the last 12 years she and her representatives and collaborators have propounded wild conspiracies theories promulgated by the political enemies of Mr LaRouche in and around the British Monarchy and the circles of the now discredited former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref name=Capon18May2015/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early life==
Donna Louise Davidson was born on July 14, 1983 and led a fairly normal childhood until she reached the age of 19. After being pregnant with her daughter Leonie for 33 weeks doctors soon realised that Donna had developed [[Dilated cardiomyopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

  | accessdate = September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonie was delivered by [[Caesarean section]] on 9 August 2002 while Donna was treated for [[heart failure]]. After 12 weeks of treatment was not successful, doctors realised that a [[heart transplant]] was the only option and on 2 November 2002 Donna received her first heart transplant at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham]]. After her transplant Donna developed [[Transplant rejection]] a number of times requiring various hospital stays. Eventually doctors gained control and Donna continued her life until December 2004 when her brother James was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and listed for a transplant. James received his heart transplant shortly after.

In April 2005 Donna started to feel short of breath and could barely walk. She was diagnosed with Chronic Organ rejection and her body had developed donor specific antibodies which were attacking her heart. This resulted in Donna being listed for another transplant as there was nothing that could be done to save this heart. Four months later Donna received heart transplant number two. In 2007 James died due to transplant complications which hit Donna hard as they had grown very close due to their illnesses. Shortly after Donna received the news that her daughter, Leonie, had also been diagnosed with Dilated cardiomyopathy. They also added that there was a fault in the TNNT2 Gene which was the cause of all their heart related problems.

==Marriage==
In July 2008 Donna met Aaran Mansell and in February 2010 Donna and Aaran married&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Donnas Dream Campaign==
'''Donnas Dream''' is a campaign for more people to sign the organ donor register in the UK. It is run by Aaran Mansell in memory of and inspired by Donna Mansell in order to raise the amount of donor organs available for [[Organ Donation]] and ultimately [[organ transplant|Transplant]] &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''East Carter High School shooting''' occurred on January 18, 1993, in [[Grayson, Kentucky]], United States. The incident occurred when 17-year-old Gary Scott Pennington walked into an English classroom and fatally shot his teacher Deanna McDavid and head custodian Marvin Hicks, and held classmates hostage for 15 minutes before surrendering to police.&lt;ref&gt;Books, Blackboards, and Bullets: School Shootings and Violence in America. Marcel Lebrun. 2011. p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==The shooting==
On Monday, January 18, 1993, Scott Pennington took a [[.38 Special|.38-caliber]] [[revolver]] that was owned by his father, and brought the weapon to school by concealing it in a [[duffel bag]]-type backpack.

At approximately 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. he entered his seventh-period English class and shot at his teacher Deanna McDavid. His first shot missed, with McDavid saying, "Scott, what are you doing!", to which Pennington replied, "Shut up, bitch".&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt; The second shot hit her in the forehead, and was fatal. Students inside her class believed this was an act that McDavid arranged for her drama club.&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt; The school custodian, Marvin Hicks, and social studies teacher Jack Calhoun entered the classroom to investigate the sounds. Pennington fatally shot Hicks in the abdomen, and aimed his pistol at Calhoun without shooting him.&lt;ref name="ppl"/&gt; Witnesses reported that Hicks pushed a female student away from himself before he was shot.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Two Killed in School Shooting in Kentucky |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDF143AF93AA25752C0A965958260 |work=New York Times |date=January 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandy Morse, a student inside the classroom, wrote a farewell letter to her family due to the fear she would be killed.&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt; Some students recalled Pennington threatening to kill other students, while others recall him telling the class he would commit suicide.&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt;

He then held his classmates hostage before he allowed two students to leave the classroom shortly after. He then allowed students to leave the room in groups of two every minute, and allowed the last five hostages to leave the classroom at 3:01&amp;nbsp;p.m. He himself walked outside of the classroom, where he surrendered to two police officers waiting in the hallway adjacent to the classroom.&lt;ref name="usnews"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jerry |last=Buckley |title=The Tragedy in Room 108 |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/931108/archive_016061.htm |work=U.S. News and World Report |date=October 31, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
*'''Deanna McDavid ''née'' Mullins''' was born on January 19, 1944, in [[Olive Hill, Kentucky]], and graduated at Olive Hill High School in 1962. She enrolled [[Morehead State University]] as an [[English major]], and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1966.&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt; She worked as a high school teacher in [[Akron, Ohio]] for 14 years,&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt; before returning to Carter County in 1981. McDavid became a senior English teacher at East Carter High School, and was also director of the school drama club. She lived in Grayson, Kentucky with her husband Daniel, and their three children &amp;ndash; son Brent, daughters Lisa and Angela.&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt; Her daughter, Lisa McNeal, is currently a Science teacher at ECHS (East Carter High School).
*'''Marvin Hicks''' was born in 1941 in Olive Hill, Kentucky, and had been employed as head custodian at East Carter High School for nine years.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; He resided in Olive Hill with his wife Margie.&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ppl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

==Perpetrator and motives==
The identity of the shooter was originally protected at the time of his arrest,&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; but was soon revealed to be 17-year-old '''Gary Scott Pennington'''. He had lived with his family in [[Elliott County, Kentucky]] his entire childhood, before moving to Carter County in August 1992. It was reported that Pennington had expressed frustration with moving to Carter County.&lt;ref name="ppl"/&gt; His family was living in [[poverty]] in the years and months prior to the shooting, as the family could not afford plumbing and lacked sufficient electricity. His father, Gary Pennington, was an unemployed former laborer and coal miner who received monthly disability pensions, due to a coal mining accident.&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt; His mother Esta was a homemaker.

Pennington had excelled academically since elementary school, participating in the academic team since the fifth grade and winning the Eastern Kentucky regional science competition in the seventh grade. He attended Elliott County High School for grades nine to eleven, and taught himself calculus during his [[freshman year]]. After moving to Carter County, he joined the academic team at East Carter High School.&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt; He also developed a grudge against his English teacher Mrs. McDavid after she gave him a "C" as his midterm grade.&lt;ref name="ppl"&gt;{{cite news |first=Susan |last=Reed |title=Reading, Writing and Murder |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20110610,00.html |work=People |date=June 14, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The midterm grade was for an essay Pennington had written about the [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[Rage (Stephen King novel)|Rage]]''; the content of the essay concerned McDavid, given that some of his other writing likewise focused on "violence, death, and dying".  McDavid even apparently brought her concerns before her colleagues.&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt;

Afterward, he said he did not dislike Mrs. McDavid, but that his intention was to kill any two people in order to become eligible for the [[capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Dedman |title=School shooters: Secret service findings |url=http://www.ustreas.gov/usss/ntac/chicago_sun/find15.htm |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=October 15, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of his affiliation with the story written by Stephen King and portraying actions like the character Charlie Decker, all books that had been written by the author were taken out of the high school until recently when they added a few of the books back into the library.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/1993/10/31/the-tragedy-in-room-108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
A [[Carter County, Kentucky|Carter County]] grand jury indicted Pennington on two counts of second-degree murder and 22 counts of kidnapping on June 15, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teen indicted in shootings at Carter school |work=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=June 16, 1993 |page=B1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the difficulty of seating an impartial jury, the trial venue was moved twice, first to [[Morgan County, Kentucky|Morgan County]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pennington slaying trial is moved a 2nd time |work=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=July 23, 1994 |page=A1 |quote=A Morgan County circuit judge yesterday decided for the second time to move the capital murder trial of Scott Pennington because it had become almost impossible to seat an impartial jury...

Opening arguments in his trial began on February 9, 1995.

===Prison assault===
At approximately 1:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Saturday, April 12, 2014, a contract food service employee at the Kentucky State Penitentiary was seriously assaulted by Pennington. The employee, JoAnne Smith, was hospitalized in stable condition. At the time of the assault, Pennington was placed in segregation at the prison pending an investigation by the [[Kentucky Department of Corrections]] and the [[Kentucky State Police]]. As a result of that investigation, Pennington was indicted by a [[Lyon County, Kentucky|Lyon County]] grand jury with first degree assault, which is a Class B felony in Kentucky. In July 2015, Pennington was convicted of first degree assault on JoAnne Smith in Lyon County and was sentenced to an additional 20 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kool.corrections.ky.gov/KOOL/Details/234096]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the criminal conviction, Pennington was transferred to the Kentucky State Reformatory shortly after the assault and faced internal Department of Corrections charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpsdlocal6.com/news/local/One-person-hurt-in-assault-at-Kentucky-State-Penitentiary-255051181.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesleader.net/news/inmate-indicted-after-ksp-attack/article_63ce08d0-d562-11e3-b9fd-0019bb2963f4.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits''''', also '''''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits''''' was published on March 13, 1847, by [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. The book is divided into three parts just as ''Either/Or'' was in 1843 and many of his other discourses were. Kierkegaard had been working toward creating a place for the concepts of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[sin]] in the conscience of the single individual. He discussed the ideas generated by both [[Johann von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Hegel]] concerning reason and nature. This book is his response to the [[idea]]s that nature and reason are perfect.

The first part of the book is a challenge to those who say they are not guilty of anything. Kierkegaard plays the questioner and asks tough questions throughout the text, such as, "What is patience? Is not patience the courage that freely takes upon itself the suffering that cannot be avoided?" "Are you now living in such a way that you are aware of being a single individual and thereby aware of your eternal responsibility before God." "Is not evil, just like evil people, at odds with itself, divided in itself?" "What is it to be more ashamed before others than before oneself but to be more ashamed of seeming than being?" "Should not he who planted the ear hear? But is not the opposite conclusion just as beautiful and convincing: Should not he whose life is sacrificing love believe that God is love?" "What means do you use to perform your work; is the means just as important to you as the end, just exactly as important?"&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 118, 135, 34, 53, 69–70, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part has to do with the idea that nature  is perfect. He goes back to Job as he did in his [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]. He says, "The silent friends did not compare Job with themselves—this did not happen until their respect (in which they silently held him) ceased and they broke the silence in order to attack the sufferer with speeches, but their presence prompted Job to compare himself with himself. No individual can be present, even though in silence, in such a way that his presence means nothing at all by way of comparison. At best, this can be done by a child, who indeed has a certain likeness to the lilies of the field and the birds of the air." "God isolated the human being, made every human being this separate and distinct individual, which is implied in the unconditional character of those first thoughts. The individual animal is not isolated, is not unconditionally separate entity; the individual animal is a number and belongs under what that most famous pagan thinker has called the animal category: the crowd. The human being who in despair turns away from those first thoughts in order to plunge into the crowd of comparisons makes himself a number, regards himself as a beast, no matter whether he by way of comparison is distinguished or lowly. But with the lilies the worried one is isolated, far away from all human or, perhaps more correctly, inhuman comparisons between individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong pp. 161, 189–191&lt;/ref&gt;

The third part deals with the concept of the abstract and the concrete examples. Kierkegaard wrote of individuals known only as A and B in his first book, ''Either/Or''. He then made them less abstract by making A into the Young Man in ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]'' (1843) and B into his guide, the psychiatrist Constantin Constantius. The same day that he published Repetition he published ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' which showed Abraham as an individual who was alone with God as he considered whether to follow his commands. He continued writing until he came to the concrete human being named [[Christ]] and wrote about the [[joy]] there is in following Christ. He's not against the [[ethics]] of Hegel or the [[aesthetics]] of Goethe but thinks that following Christ is the one thing needful. And that [[double-mindedness]] is the beginning of the sickness of the spirit for the single individual.

==Structure==
The book begins with a dedication just as some of his ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' did, however, this book is not dedicated to his father, but to “That Single Individual”. He published these discourses and later wrote a longer dedication called ''The Crowd is Untruth''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/kierkegaard/untruth/files/untruth.html The Crowd is Untruth]&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt; This, which is now considerably revised and enlarged, was written and intended to accompany the dedication to "that single individual," which is found in "Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits." Copenhagen, Spring 1847.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] translated ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'' by Kierkegaard in 1939, 1962 and included ''My Activity as a Writer'' by Soren Kierkegaard (1851) in the book. Here Kierkegaard wrote, "I attached myself again religiously to "that individual", to whom the next essential work (after the Concluding Postscript) was dedicated. I refer to ''Edifying Discourses in Divers Spirits'', or rather the first part of that book which is an exhortation to confession. Perhaps nobody noticed it the first time I employed the category "that individual", and nobody paid much attention to the fact that it was repeated in stereotyped form in the preface of every number of the ''Edifying Discourses''. Religiously speaking, there is no such thing as a [[public]], but only [[individual]]s; for religion is seriousness and seriousness is the individual."&lt;ref&gt;''The Point of View'' by Walter Lowrie 1939, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

This book has a [[preface]] and Kierkegaard has said to pay attention to the prefaces in his book of the same name. The book also has a [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dedication dedication]. Here is the first half of his [[Prefaces|preface]]. Kierkegaard thinks an individual must bring the occasion (the need) along with him or her to become the learner.  {{Quote|Preface: Although this little book (it can be called an occasional discourse, yet without having the occasion that makes the speaker and makes him an authority or the occasion that makes the ''reader'' and makes him a ''learner'') in the situation of actuality is like a fancy, a dream in the daytime, yet it is not without confidence and not without hope of fulfillment. It seeks that single individual, to whom it gives itself wholly, by whom it wishes to be received as if it had arisen in his own heart, that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call ''my'' reader, that single individual, who willingly reads slowly, reads repeatedly, and who reads aloud-for his own sake. If it finds him, then in the remoteness of separation the understanding is complete when he keeps the book and the understanding to himself in the inwardness of appropriation.  P. 5}}

===On the Occasion of a Confession===
''On the Occasion of a Confession''&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, 1847, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993 p. 325–326&lt;/ref&gt; was a postscript to the first section of ''[[Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions]]'' (On the Occasion of a Confessional Service). This section has also been titled ''Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing''&lt;ref&gt;Here Kierkegaard wrote &lt;blockquote&gt;Just as a person should not seek his peace through another human being and should not build upon sand, so it also holds true that he should not rely on any other person's work to convince him that he’s a sinner, but rather to remind him of his own responsibility before God if he does not discover it by himself—any other understanding is diversion. It is only a jest if I would pass judgment on you, but it is a serious matter if you forget that God will pass the judgment. So what is sought is given. God is near enough, but ''no one without purity can see God, and sin is impurity, and therefore no one can become aware of God without becoming a sinner''. The first is a beckoning word, and the gaze of the soul is toward the heights where the goal is, but other words that provide the beginning are immediately heard, and these are depressing words. And yet this is the way it is for the person who wants to understand sin.... "The doctor and the pastor ask about your health, but eternity makes you responsible for your condition." ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' p. 28 Hong translation, Purity of Heart, Streere 1938 p. 209–210&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard asks how an individual can find out if he or she is on the "right" path in life. [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] and [[repentance]] before God is his answer with a warning about [[double-mindedness]]. If a single individual were to ask him or herself all the questions asked in this section and try discover all the evasions used to keep from acting single-mindedly, that person would discover that it is very difficult to say I am innocent. In ''Works of Love'' (1847) he asks his reader to "Imagine an enthusiast who enthusiastically wills only one thing and enthusiastically wants to sacrifice everything for the good."&lt;ref&gt;''Works of Love'', Hong 1995 p. 184ff&lt;/ref&gt; Here he is writing about the inwardness of prayer. He says, {{Quote|God does not find out anything by your confessing, but you, the one confessing do. Much of what you try to keep in obscurity you first get to know by letting an omniscient one become aware of it. Even horrible crimes are committed, even blood is shed, and many times in such a way that it must truly be said of the guilty one: He did not know what he was doing –perhaps he died without, through repentance, ever getting to know what it was he did. Indeed, does passion ever really know what it is doing; is not this its ingratiating temptation and its apparent excuse, this delusive ignorance of itself because at the moment it had forgotten the eternal, because continued in a person it changes his life into nothing but moments, because it perfidiously serves its blinded master while working its way up to make him serve like a blinded slave! Hate and anger and revenge and despondency and depression and despair and fear of the future and trust in the world and faith in oneself and pride that mixes in even with sympathy, and envy that mixes in even with friendship, and the changed but not improved inclination—when this was present in a person, when was it without the delusive excuse of ignorance? If a person continued being ignorant of it, was it not precisely because he also continued being ignorant of an omniscient one?
 
The lazy person always has an inordinate imagination; he promptly thinks of how he is going to arrange things for himself and how comfortable he will be as soon as this and that are done; he thinks less about the fact that it is this and that which he is to do. … He does not think that it is the will a person should lean on, yes, that when everything goes to pieces it is the will a person must cling to. He does not think that the will is the mover but that it itself is to be moved, that it itself is vacillating and therefore must be propped up, that it must be moved and supported by reasons, considerations, the advice of others, experiences, and rules of conduct. 
Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong pp. 23, 73–74}}

He asks, "What does the [[conscience]] want to emphasize by means of the awareness that you are a single individual?" (Hong p.&amp;nbsp;132) He answers this way: &lt;blockquote&gt;To will, in the decision, to be and to remain with the good is truth's brief expression for willing to do everything, and in this expression the equality is maintained that recognizes no distinction with regard to that more essential diversity of life or of the human condition: to be acting or to be suffering, since the one who is suffering can, in the decision, also be with the good. …. With respect to the highest, with respect to willing to do everything, it makes no difference at all, God be praised, how big or how little the task. Oh, how merciful the eternal is to us human beings! Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 79–80&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, in Works of Love, Kierkegaard sums up the essence of what it means to have a pure heart using a metaphors from [[Archimedes]] and the New Testament. {{Quote|Make Christianity your own and it will show you a point outside the world, and by means of this you will move heaven and earth; yes, you will do something even more wonderful, you will move heaven and earth so quietly, so lightly, that no one notices it. The world makes a great noise merely in order to achieve a little change, sets heaven and earth in motion for nothing, like the mountain that gives birth to a mouse-Christianity quietly makes infinity's change as if it were nothing. It is very quiet, as nothing in this world can be; it is very quiet, as only the dead of inwardness can be. Indeed, what else is Christianity but inwardness! Love must be out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of a sincere faith. We choose, however, to concentrate attention on the one provision, that love is a matter of conscience, which essentially contains the other two and to which they essentially refer. ''Works of Love'', Hong pp. 136–137}}

===''What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and from the Birds in the Air'' ===
The first discourse (''To Be Contented with Being a Human Being'') deals with [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comparison comparison] and choice and how to trust God with the choice once made. He may have been echoing Goethe's [[Propylaen]] in which Goethe had written "The youth, when Nature and Art attract him, thinks that with a vigorous effort he can soon penetrate into the innermost sanctuary; the man, after long wanderings, finds himself still in the outer court. Such an observation has suggested our title. It is only on the step, in the gateway, the entrance, the vestibule, the space between the outside and the inner chamber, between the sacred and the common, that we may ordinarily tarry with our friends."&lt;ref&gt;Johann Goethe [http://www.bartleby.com/39/34.html ''Introduction to the Propyläen''] 1798&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard writes about nature differently than Goethe but similarly because both see Nature as teachers of human kind and Kierkegaard wrote very much about "the inner being"; the [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or II p. 167 Hong, Fear and Trembling Hong pp. 60–61, Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 79, Repetition p. 200ff Hong, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 458, 499, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 269ff, 328–329&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard wrote a great story about a lily and a naughty bird. It begins like this: {{Quote|[[File:Lily flower.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]Once upon a time there was a lily that stood in an isolated spot beside a small brook and was well known to some nettles and also to a few other small flowers nearby. The lily was, according to the Gospel's truthful account, more beautifully clothed than Solomon in all his glory and in addition was joyful and free of care all the day long. Imperceptibly and blissfully time slipped by, like running water that murmurs and disappears. It so happened that one day a little bird came and visited the lily; it came again the next day, then stayed away a few days before it came again, which struck the lily as odd and inexplicable—inexplicable that the bird, just like the flowers, did not remain in the same place, odd that the bird could be so capricious. But as so often happens, the lily fell more and more in love with the bird precisely because it was capricious. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 167 later he wrote about a wood dove and tame doves p. 174ff}}

The second discourse deals with diverting oneself from worries by "learning from the bird how glorious it is to be a human being."&lt;ref&gt;''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; David F. Swenson translated several of Kierkegaard's discourses which were published in 1958 through the efforts of Paul L Holmer. Kierkegaard wrote of ''The Glory of Our Common Humanity''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/edifyingdiscours00kier#page/230/mode/2up ''The Glory of Our Common Humanity''] Swenson translation&lt;/ref&gt; This was the second of three discourses that were all based on the text from [[Matthew 6]] verses 24 to the end. It was titled ''How Glorious It Is to Be a [[Human Being]]'' by Howard V Hong when he translated Kierkegaard's book in 1993.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The structure of the three discourses about the lilies and the birds is as follows: the first is esthetic, the second ethical, the third religious. ''Journal and Papers of Soren Kierkegaard'' VIII A 1 1847&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaard writes about the gift given to human beings that nature doesn't have, conscience. With the use of conscience we can know about time and the future. Something nature cannot know.&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 193–198&lt;/ref&gt; He sums the human ability to love and the distinctiveness of nature up in Works of Love, which he published four months later. {{Quotation| Love does not seek its own. The truly loving one does not love his own distinctiveness but, in contrast, loves every human being according to his distinctiveness; but 'his distinctiveness'; is what for him is his own; that is, the loving one does not seek his own; quite the opposite, he loves what is the others own. Let us for a moment look at nature. With what infinite love nature or God in nature encompasses all the diverse things that have life and existence! Just recollect what you yourself have so often delighted in looking at, recollect the beauty of the meadow!

There is no difference in the love, no, none—yet what a difference in the flowers! Even the least, the most insignificant the most unimpressive, the poor little flower disregarded by even its immediate surroundings, the flower you can hardly find without looking carefully—it is as if this, too, had said to love: Let me become something in myself, something distinctive. And then love has helped it to become its own distinctiveness, but far more beautiful than the poor little flower had ever dared to hope for.

What love! First it makes no distinction, none at all; next, which is just like the first, it infinitely distinguishes itself in loving the diverse. Wondrous love! For what is as difficult as to make no distinction at all in loving, and if one makes no distinction at all, what is as difficult as making distinctions! Just suppose nature were us human beings—rigid, domineering, cold, partisan, small-minded, capricious—and imagine, yes, just imagine what would happen to the beauty of the meadow.

So it is also in the relationships of love among human beings; only true love loves every human being according to the person's distinctiveness. The rigid, the domineering person lacks flexibility, lacks the pliability to comprehend others; he demands his own from everyone, wants everyone to be transformed in his image to be trimmed according to his pattern for human beings. If the rigid and domineering person cannot ever create, he wants at least to transform – that is, he seeks his own so that wherever he points he can say: See, it is my image, it is my idea, it is my will. ''Works of Love'', Hong 1995 p. 269–270}}

The third discourse was titled ''What Blessed Happiness is Promised in Being a Human Being'' by Howard V Hong.  Kierkegaard is constantly stressing the importance there is in being a human being instead of a beast in the field because you have been given the gift of [[choice]]. "A choice. My listener, do you know how to express in a single word anything more glorious! If you talked year in and year out, could you mention anything more glorious than a choice, to have choice! It is certainly true that the sole blessing is to choose rightly, but certainly choice itself is the glorious condition."&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard began writing about this choice in his first book ''[[Either/Or]]'' where he wrote first as the [[aesthetic]] and then as the [[ethicist]]. Hegel thinks that history and philosophy should come afterwards and explain events. Kierkegaard thinks its better to come beforehand.&lt;blockquote&gt;Only one word more concerning the desire to teach the world what it ought to be. For such a purpose philosophy at least always comes too late. Philosophy, as the thought of the world, does not appear until reality has completed its formative process, and made itself ready. History thus corroborates the teaching of the conception that only in the maturity of reality does the ideal appear as counterpart to the real, apprehends the real world in its substance, and shapes it into an intellectual kingdom. When philosophy paints its grey in grey, one form of life has become old, and by means of grey it cannot be rejuvenated, but only known. The owl of Minerva takes its flight only when the shades of night are gathering.
* Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) ''Philosophy of Right'' translated by SW Dyde Queen's University Canada 1896 edition ''Preface xxx''&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all [[philosophy]]. It is only at certain moments that I view everything ''acterno modo'', as [[Spinoza]] says, but I live constantly ''aeterno modo.'' There are many who think that they live thus, because after having done the one or the other, they combine or mediate the opposites. But this is a misunderstanding: for the true eternity does not lie behind either/or, but before it. Hence, their eternity will be a painful succession of temporal moments, for they will be consumed by a two-fold regret. 
*Soren Kierkegaard, ''Either/Or'' part I, Swenson p. 37–39&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam. Indeed, I assure you that if my life through no fault of my own were so interwoven with sorrows and sufferings that I could call myself the greatest [[tragic hero]], could divert myself with my affliction and shock the world by naming it, my choice is made: I strip myself of the hero's garb and the pathos of tragedy; I am not the tormented one who can be proud of his sufferings; I am the humbled one who feels my offense; I have only one word for what I am suffering—guilt, only one word for my pain—repentance, only one hope before my eyes—forgiveness. And if it proves to be difficult for me to do—oh, then I have only one prayer. I would throw myself upon the earth and appeal from morning till night to the heavenly power who rules the world for one favor, that it might be granted me to repent, for I know only one sorrow that could bring me to despair and plunge everything into it—that repentance is an illusion, an illusion not with respect to the forgiveness it seeks but with respect to the [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/imputation imputation] it [[presupposition|presupposes]]. 
*Soren Kierkegaard, ''Either/Or'' part II, Hong  p. 237–238&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Spiritually understood, temporality and eternity are two magnitudes that are to be weighed. But in order to deliberate the person in turn must be a third party or have a third position in relation to the two magnitudes. This is the choice: he weighs, he deliberates, he chooses. Here, however there is never any chance that the two magnitudes weigh equally much, which can of course happen with a scale, it indicates the relation as one of equality. No, praise God, that can never happen, because properly understood the eternal already has a certain overweight and the person who refuses to understand this can never begin really to deliberate. So a person deliberates before he begins. 
*Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong p. 306–307&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaard stresses not only having a choice but learning how to use it. He concludes, "But then in his sadness out there with the lily and the bird the [[worry|worried]] one did indeed acquire something other than his worry to think about; he began to consider what blessed happiness is promised in being a human being. Then let the lily wither and let its loveliness become indiscernible; let the leaf fall to the ground and the bird fly away; let it become dark on the fields—God's kingdom does not change with the seasons! So let the rest be needed for a long time or a short time, let all these things have their moment when they are lacking or possessed, their moment is a subject of discussion until in death they are eternally forgotten—God's kingdom is still that which is to be sought first but which ultimately will also last through all eternities, and "if that which will be abolished was glorious, that which remains will be more glorious,:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3 2 ''Corinthians 3:11'']&lt;/ref&gt; and if it was hard to live in want, then it must indeed be only an easier separation to die to want!&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Gospel of Sufferings===
A.S Aldworth and W.S. Ferrie from Cambridge University translated ''The Gospel of Sufferings'' in 1955. The following is from his introduction. {{Quote|In his trilogy ''Opbyggelige Taler i Forskellig Aand'' ("Edifying Discourses in Another Vein"), Kierkegaard passed from a general religious and philosophical standpoint to a specifically Christian one. The Gospel of Sufferings forms the third part of that trilogy, and is a central plank in the structure of Kierkegaard's mature thought. "The theme [of these discourses] is our sufferings. It is also the gospel that pertains to, and is appropriate to, our sufferings. It is in the realm of faith, and though this gospel that is the peculiar property of those who suffer, that sufferings are found to contain joys. We may say therefore that it is the purpose of this volume to disclose the meaning in the most meaningless element of life. Which might be held to be quite a good definition of the Christian faith."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldcat.org/title/gospel-of-sufferings-lidelsernes-evangelium-christian-discourses-being-the-third-part-of-edifying-discourses-in-a-different-vein-published-in-1847-at-copenhagen/oclc/2940311&amp;referer=brief_results ''Gospel of sufferings''] from World Cat. [https://www.amazon.com/Gospel-Sufferings-Library-Theological-Translations/dp/0227674685 ''The Gospel of Sufferings''] Amazon&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Now he begins to write of the meaning and joy there is in following [[Christ]]. It wasn't the first thing he wrote about but he did write about learning, over time, to follow Christ and while learning to also learn to confess, repent and accept as well as give forgiveness. His emphasis has been on seeking God's kingdom first (Matthew 6:33) and learning to be "silent before God".&lt;ref&gt;How can you tell when you are confessing Christ and when you are judging others? ''The Joy of It That Bold Confidence Is Able in Suffering to Take Power from the World and Has the Power to Change Scorn into Honor, Downfall into Victory''  p. 321-341&lt;/ref&gt;

His first three texts are from [[Luke 14]]:27 ''Whoever does not carry his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.''  [[Matthew 11]]:30 ''My yoke is beneficial, and my burden light.'' and ''It is said of him the Lord Jesus Christ: Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he [[Suffering|suffered]]'' [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+5&amp;version=KJV Hebrews 5:8]. [[Acts 5]]:41 Kierkegaard writes about why it might not be so great to have the "distinction" of being an [[apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993 p. 327ff (333–334)&lt;/ref&gt; ''they went away joyful because they had been deemed worthy to be scorned for the sake of Christ's name''. He concluded this way: {{Quote|We have now considered the joy in the thought that bold confidence has this power of victory; we have also called to mind how the apostles understood themselves in this thought. We dare not withhold from anyone the joy, the triumphant joy contained in that thought; we dare not suppress the fact that bold confidence has this power. But neither have we played fast and loose with our words; on the contrary, to the best of our ability we have added the weight of earnest reflections to the joy, in order if possible to exercise a restraining influence. This joyful thought is not like a so-called harmless remedy that can be used in any way without danger and can be used for a light cold, but it is strong medicine, the use of which involves some danger, but rightly used also delivers from the [[The Sickness Unto Death|sickness unto death]].  Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong 1993 p. 339}}

Kierkegaard compared a pound of gold and a pound of feathers. He views the pound of feathers as a lesser weight because of the value of gold compared to feathers. He then asks the reader to decide if a pound of temporality is equal to a pound of eternity.&lt;ref&gt;''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong 1993 p. 318–319&lt;/ref&gt; Feathers and gold and temporality and eternity and numbers all have value in this world. He has [[7 (number)#Religion and mythology|seven]] different discourses in this [[3 (number)#In religion|third]] section. He seems to be using religious numbers generally while writing but always referring to [[Christianity]] specifically.

Kierkegaard seems to have fulfilled his goal presented in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, where he said it had become clear to him that people had forgotten what it means to be religious (confession and repentance before God) and had also forgotten what it means to be a human being and had therefore also forgotten what it means to try to become a Christian. He put it this way. {{Quote|The main thought was that, because of the copiousness of knowledge, people in our day have forgotten what it means to exist, and what inwardness is, and that the misunderstanding between speculative thought and Christianity could be explained by that. I resolved to go back as far as possible in order not to arrive too soon at what it means to exist religiously, not to mention existing Christianly-religiously, and in that way leave dubieties behind me. If people had forgotten what it means to exist religiously, they had probably also forgotten what it means to exist humanly. I resolved to begin: first was to have the existence relation between esthetic and ethical come into existence in an existing human.&lt;ref&gt;[[Either/Or]]&lt;/ref&gt; But this must not on any account be done didactically, because then the misunderstanding would in a new misunderstanding instantly make capital of the explanatory attempt, as if existing consisted in coming to know something about a particular point. If this is communicated as knowledge, the recipient is mistakenly induced to understand that he is gaining something to know, and then we are back in knowledge again. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong 1996 p. 249}}

==Criticism==
''Edifiying Discourses in Diverse Spirits'', also ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' was published on March 13, 1847, and is one of the first books in [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s second authorship. His first authorship included all of his books up to and including  ''[[Two Ages: A Literary Review]]'' which was published March 30, 1846. He had just published his ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'' to ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' on February 27, 1846. He wrote both [[pseudonym]]ous books as well as books signed by his own name. His ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' were all signed by Soren Kierkegaard as author while other books, such as, ''Either/Or'', ''Repetition'', and ''The Concept of Anxiety'' were published under pseudonyms. Howard V. Hong says the book had no record of sales and was not reprinted in Kierkegaard's lifetime.

Previously Kierkegaard had published his own books through two different bookstores, Bookdealer P. G. Philipsen ''[[Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]'' and C.A. Reitzel's, Printed by Biance Luno Press ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]''. This book was published "on an honorarium basis" through another Danish book publisher, Reitzel Forlag. The publishing cost was minimum.

The first section was translated into English in 1938 by [[Douglas V. Steere]] and titled ''Purity of Heart Is To Will One Thing''.  Steere also wrote the introduction to David F Swenson's 1946 translation of ''[[Works of Love]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XOMDcgAACAAJ Google Link to Swenson's translation of Works of Love]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library|Howard V. and Edna H. Hong]] translated all the discourses and [[Princeton University Press]] published them in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong introduction xii–xiii [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5241.html Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong 1993, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars generally paid more attention to his pseudonymous writings than his discourses.

Harold Victor Martin published ''Kierkegaard, the Melancholy Dane'' (1950) and had this to say about this book: {{Quotation|The personal religious sense of ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard book)|Repetition]]'' in relation to time and eternity is brought out by Kierkegaard in a striking Discourse entitled: ''The Joy of it—that what thou dost lose temporally, thou dost gain eternally.'' Within his temporal existence, man can only lose the temporal temporally. The seriousness of life is that it is possible for man in his temporal existence to lose the eternal; and this in fact is Kierkegaard's definition of sin—in time to lose eternity. What man must strive after is to gain the eternal eternally. p. 60&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001918252 ''Kierkegaard, the melancholy Dane'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Robert L Perkins of Stetson University edited ''The International Kierkegaard Commentary Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' in 2005. This book presents scholarly perspectives regarding from people interested in the writings of Soren Kierkegaard. He states that A.S. Aldworth and W.S. Ferrie published ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' in three parts ''Purify your Hearts'' (1937), ''Consider the Lilies'' (1940) and ''Gospel of Suffering'' (1955), the 1955 edition was reprinted in an American edition in 1964. Gospel  of Sufferings and The Lilies of the Field were translated by David F Swenson and Lillian Marvin Swenson in 1948. Perkin's book is in External Links below.

Douglas V. Steere wrote a lengthy introduction to his 1938 publication of the first part of Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits. ''Purify your Heart'' of 1937 became ''Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing'' in the hands of Steere in 1938. He says Eduard Geismar (1871–1939), the Danish scholar, said of the book, "It seems to me that nothing that he has written has sprung so directly out of his relationship with God as this address. Anyone who wishes to understand Kierkegaard properly will do well to begin with it."&lt;ref&gt;Steere, ''Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing'', intro p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Steere wrote ''Doors Into Life'' in 1948 and devoted his fourth chapter to Kierkegaard and ''Purity of Heart''. He said, "In a strangely universal way, Kierkegaard is both ancient and modern, both a fierce desert prophet and a metropolitan sophisticate who is all too well schooled in the artifices of modern life to be deceived by them."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Doors_into_life_through_five_devotional.html?id=aUBZAAAAMAAJ ''Doors Into Life'' Harper and Brothers p. 119ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geismar lectured on Kierkegaard at Princeton University in 1936. He wrote the following about this book, {{Quote|The way of repentance is described in a long communion sermon of more than a hundred pages. The theme of this sermon is that "'purity of heart' consists of singleness of aim." Kierkegaard explains that it is only possible to will one thing if we will the good, and that such willing is real only if we will the good in entire single-mindedness.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Geismar, ''Lectures on the Religious thought of Soren Kierkegaard'', 1936 p. 59ff&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Howard V Hong translated the wrote book in 1993 along with his wife Edna H Hong. It was translated again in 2005. Hong's 1993 introduction surmised that Kierkegaard perhaps published 500 copies of this book during his lifetime.

''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' &amp; ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' were reviewed together in 1994 by Karl Dusza for ''First Things Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstthings.com/issue ''First Things'']&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote {{Quote|If the age of Kierkegaard was the age of individualism, is our own not the age of super-individualism? If the age of Kierkegaard was also the age of romanticism, is ours not the age of super-romanticism? And if in a deeper sense Kierkegaard's age was neither that of individualism nor that of romanticism but rather in essence the age of the crowd, what is our own if not the age of the super-crowd? How fortunate for us, then, that this solitary Dane exercised his awesome analytical and rhetorical skills to tear down the veil of deception and uncover the essential folly of his time, and in so doing, bequeathed to us powerful critical tools. He has indeed left us a mirror; peering into it, we can see the folly of our time and glimpse the abyss we are in danger of falling into. ''Appropriating the Paradox''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9402/reviews/dusza.html ''Appropriating the Paradox'' Karl Dusza ]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kierkegaard wrote about the expectation of the Christian. The difference Christ made in the world is that he took away the burdens of the Christian. Kierkegaard wrote much about the [[consciousness]] of [[sin]] and wrote about the difference Christianity makes.&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, 1847 ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong pp. 240–242&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|&lt;blockquote&gt;When Christ speaks of the light burden, when he says my burden, there can also be quite particularly the thought of a burden that he has laid upon his followers. He has indeed laid it upon them to carry human burdens lightly, but then in addition a light burden that is specifically for the Christians. What is this? Let us first ask this question: Of all burdens, which is the heaviest? Certainly the consciousness of sin; that is beyond dispute. But the one who takes away the consciousness of sin and gives the consciousness of forgiveness instead—he indeed takes away the heavy burden and give the light one in its place. But why a burden, even if it is called light? Yes, if someone will not understand that forgiveness is also a burden that must be carried, even though a light burden, he is taking forgiveness in vain. Forgiveness is not to be earned—it is not that heavy; but neither is it to be taken in vain and it is not that light either. Forgiveness is not to be paid for—it is not that costly and it cannot be paid for; but neither is it to be taken away as nothing; it is bought at too high a price for that. ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993, p. 246 &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it more desperate to despair over the truth than not to dare to face the truth! Everyone who secretly houses that gloomy thought about God is in despair. In the spiritual sense, one can see it in him, as it were, because in relation to God he is not like someone who drops his eyes in the consciousness of his guilt and of what he owes God, nor is he like someone who humbly lifts his trusting gaze to God—no, he glowers. Truly, it would be better to dispel the gloom than to glower, to shudder at the thought of this horror that actually belongs to paganism, the horror that God was unable or unwilling to give a person bold confidence. A false god can neither reduce a person to nothing nor make him perceive the nothing that he is—for that the false god is too weak. Neither can a false god give a person bold confidence—he is not strong enough for that. This is why we can say that the false god himself taught the pagan to glower. Even the wisest pagan who has ever lived, however much wiser he otherwise was then the lowliest believer, still has, in comparison with him, a gloominess in his inner being, because when all is said and done the pagan could never be eternally sure and clear whether the fault lay with him or whether it might in a rare case lie with God, whether hopelessness was not a state in which a person can be without guilt because the god himself bears the guilt by leaving him without a task. One can excuse the pagan only by saying that this is so because his god himself is gloomy. But the Christian’s God is clarity. Therefore every human being is without excuse and without any excuse. ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993, p. 277–280&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

James Collins, from Saint Louis University, wrote the following about Kierkegaard's ''Gospel of Suffering'' in 1953. "Find a point which is under fire by an atheist of the nineteenth century and which is also defended by a seventeenth century man of faith and you have found an incontrovertibly religious belief. Such is the case with suffering, which is a scandal to a [[Feuerbach]] and a matter of glory to a [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], but to both a distinguishing note of the Christian mode of existence. In the degree that it promotes a meditative inwardness, Christianity makes us aware of God's supreme goodness and our own distance from, and hostility towards, His holiness. A religious sense of one's own sinfulness leads neither to morbid despair nor to rationalization. It issues in a voluntary acceptance of suffering as a way of atoning for sin to God, the just judge, and a way of approaching closer to God the redeemer. In a series of discourses entitled ''The Gospel of Suffering'', Kierkegaard establishes the relation between guilt, suffering, and the triumph of faith, much after the manner of Luther's dialectical treatment of the theme of the sinner as a believer."&lt;ref&gt;James Collins, ''The Mind of Kierkegaard'' Princeton University Press 1953, 1983P. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Polk''' (17 October 1913 – May 1948) was an American [[journalist]] for [[CBS]] who was murdered during the [[Greek Civil War]], in 1948.

==World War II==
During [[World War II]], Polk enlisted with a [[Seabees in World War II|Naval Construction Battalion]]. After the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|invasion of Guadalcanal]], the first element of Construction Unit Base 1 (CUB-1), an advance fuel and supply base, landed on 16 August 1942. This element was commanded by [[Ensign (United States)|Ensign]] George W. Polk, [[United States Naval Reserve|USNR]], and consisted of five officers and 118 enlisted personnel, all navy [[petty officer]]s of aviation support ratings. CUB-1 later received a Presidential Unit Citation for its service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/department_arch.html U.S. Navy All Hands magazine] [http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/archpdf/ah194404.pdf April 1944], p. 32. and [http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/npswapa/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003122-00/sec2.htm TIME OF THE ACES: Marine Pilots in the Solomons]&lt;/ref&gt; Polk also performed duty as a "volunteer" dive bomber and reconnaissance pilot. He was wounded, suffered from [[malaria]] and was hospitalized for almost a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/35737 |title=Richard B. Frank : Celebrated Journalist George Polk's Real WW II Record |publisher=Historynewsnetwork.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek Civil War==
Polk disappeared in Greece and was found dead a few days later on Sunday 16 May 1948, shot at [[point-blank range]] in the back of the head, and with hands and feet tied. Polk had been covering the civil war in Greece between the right wing government and communists and had been critical of both sides.  He had also alleged that a few officials in the Greek government had embezzled $250,000 in foreign aid ($2.5 million in 2016 dollars) from the Truman Administration, a charge that was never proved.  Polk had been particularly outspoken in his criticism of the Truman government's unqualified support for the rightist authoritarian regime in Greece.

In the late 1970s, the story emerged as to how AMAG (American Mission for Aid to Greece) authorities helped the Greek police frame two young communists for his death. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  A communist journalist, Gregorios Staktopoulos, was tried and convicted of helping Vaggelis Vasvanas and Adam Mouzenidis, members of the illegal communist army, commit the murder. The communist guerilla radio station claimed that Adam Mouzenidis was already dead, having been killed in an aerial bombing by the [[Hellenic Air Force]], when Polk was murdered. Staktopoulos himself maintained that the confession that led to his conviction was obtained through [[torture]].  In fact, it was later revealed that Adam Mouzenidis had arrived at Salonica, where he was allegedly introduced to Polk, two days after Polk's murder, and Vasvanas was not in Greece at the time. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} An investigation by James G. M. Kellis (also known as Killis), a former [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] officer with knowledge of Greek political circles and power brokers, concluded that Greek communist circles lacked the power and influence to commit the murder and cover it up. Kellis worked on contract for the [[Wall Street]] law firm of [[William Joseph Donovan|William 'Wild Bill' Donovan]], the former head of OSS, who was hired by journalist [[Walter Lippman]] to investigate the case. Following Kellis' conclusion that it was more likely Polk had been murdered by right-wing groups within or affiliated to the Greek government, the investigation was halted and Kellis recalled to Washington. At the time the US government was financially supporting the Greek government to prevent a communist take-over of the country. The British government had supported the Greek government throughout 1941&amp;ndash;1945, but this became a financial impossibility after the war.

Polk had married Rea Coccins (also known as Rhea Kokkonis), a Greek national and ex-[[Flight attendant|stewardess]], seven months prior to his death.  They had no children.  After being allegedly harassed and threatened by the Greek government, Rea fled to the U.S. where she was debriefed by Donovan's law firm. She became friendly with Barbara Colby, the wife of [[William Colby]], a former OSS officer attached to Donovan's firm, who later would become director of the [[CIA]].

Reporters in New York city started a fundraising project to send an independent investigation committee to Greece, and from this effort the ''newsmen's commission'' was formed. Members included [[Ernest Hemingway]], William Polk (George Polk's brother), [[William A. Price]] (Polk's cousin) and [[Homer Bigart]]. This was soon however eclipsed in media coverage by the ''Lippman Committee'', consisting mostly of Washington journalists with Walter Lippman as chairman and [[James Reston]] of ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Within months of his death, a group of American journalists created the [[George Polk Awards]] for outstanding radio or television journalism.  These awards were modeled after the [[Pulitzer Prize]] which is awarded for outstanding print journalism in newspapers.

==Criticism==
In February 2007, Polk's "status as a symbol of journalistic integrity" was challenged by historian Richard Frank, who concluded that Polk made false claims about his service record in World War II. Frank examined the claim, repeated by Edward R. Murrow, that Polk had commanded a unit of 119 Marines on Guadacanal, flew a fighter plane that shot down 11 Japanese aircraft and won a Purple Heart. He concluded that it is not consistent with the available documentation. Frank said that "the inescapable conclusion is that George Polk did not simply verbally recount false tales of his wartime exploits to his family and to his journalist colleagues, he actually forged documents to buttress his stories."

George Polk's brother, William, replied to this attack, which he called slanderous, in a letter to the Guardian Monday March 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=19.52 EDT |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/mediaguardian/story/0,,2036930,00.html |title=Letters &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; The Guardian |publisher=Media.guardian.co.uk |date=2007-03-19 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He pointed out that Frank did not discuss a single article Polk ever wrote and that his military record is amply substantiated in a range of military documents, including a picture of Polk being decorated by Vice-Admiral John McCain on November 30, 1943, on behalf of the "Airplane Cruiser Detachment for their heroic role during the Battle for the Solomons." &lt;ref&gt;A more detailed reply can be found at http://www.williampolk.com/pdf/2007/open%20letter%20to%20winners%20of%20the%20geo%20polk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, Frank responded to William Polk's letters and to what he considered a baffling silence from journalists that greeted his charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/013/506hdoal.asp |title=The Unanswered Case Against George Polk |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=2007-04-13 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gleb Svyatoslavich''' ({{circa}} 1052&amp;nbsp;– 30 May 1078) was [[Prince of Tmutarakan]] and [[Principality of Novgorod|Novgorod]]. He ruled Tmutarakan under the overall authority of his father [[Sviatoslav II of Kiev|Sviatoslav Iaroslavich]], [[Prince of Chernigov]]. He was twice expelled from his principality by one of his cousins [[Rostislav of Tmutarakan|Rostislav Vladimirovich]].

His father appointed him prince of Novgorod in 1067 or 1068. He suppressed a rebellion incited by a sorcerer against the [[Diocese of Novgorod and Staraya Russa|bishop of the town]]. Later he was expelled from Novgorod, and was killed by the [[Chudes]]. The ''[[Russian Primary Chronicle]]'' writes that he "was kindly toward the poor and hospitable to strangers, zealous toward the church, warm in faith, peaceful, and fair in appearance".&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Primary Chronicle'' (year 6586), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=143}}

==Early life==
Gleb was the eldest of the fours sons of [[Sviatoslav II of Kiev|Sviatoslav Iaroslavich]], [[Prince of Chernigov]] by his first wife, Killikiya.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|pp=38-39}} According to historian Martin Dimnik, Gleb was born around 1049.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=40}} He was named after his father's holy uncle, [[Boris and Gleb|Gleb]].{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=78}} His father appointed him to rule [[Tmutarakan]],{{sfn|Vernadsky|1948|p=84}} an important port by the [[Strait of Kerch]], but the year of his appointment is unknown.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|pp=55-56}}

==Prince of Tmutarakan==

According to the ''[[Russian Primary Chronicle]]'', Gleb's cousin [[Rostislav of Tmutarakan|Rostislav Vladimirovich]] "fled to Tmutorakan"&lt;ref name="Russian_Primary_Chronicle_6572_144"&gt;''Russian Primary Chronicle'' (year 6572), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1064.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=58}} He expelled Gleb from Tmutorakan and "occupied his principate for himself".&lt;ref name="Russian_Primary_Chronicle_6572_144"/&gt;{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=58}}{{sfn|Martin|1993|p=41}} Although Gleb was restored by his father in 1065, once Sviatoslav Iaroslavich had returned with his army to [[Chernigov]], Rostislav invaded again and displaced Gleb from power once more.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=58}}{{sfn|Vernadsky|1948|p=85}}

However, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] ''[[katepano]]'' or governor of [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]] poisoned Rostislav who died on 3 February 1067.{{sfn|Martin|1993|p=41}}{{sfn|Vernadsky|1948|p=85}}{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=59}} According to the ''Life of Feodosy'', the citizens of Tmutorakan requested the monk Nikon the Great to persuade Sviatoslav Iaroslavich to again appoint Gleb as their prince.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=64}} The saintly monk succeeded and Gleb returned to Tmutarakan.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=64}} According to the inscription of the "[[Stone of Tmutarakan]]", Gleb had the width of the frozen Strait of Kerch measured in the winter of 1067-68.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|pp=64-65}}

==Prince of Novgorod==
[[File:Principalities of Kievan Rus' (1054-1132).jpg|thumb |right |190px |alt=Map of the Kievan Rus' | Principalities in the [[Kievan Rus']] (1054-1132)]]
Gleb was transferred{{mdash}}according to historian Martin Dimnik, by his father{{mdash}}from Tmutarakan to [[Novgorod]] in 1067 or 1068.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|pp=64-65}} A distant relative of his, [[Vseslav of Polotsk|Vseslav Briacheslavich]] lay siege to Novgorod "on October 23, the day of the [[Jesus|Lord]]'s brother, [[James the Just|St James]], a Friday, at the sixth hour of the day",&lt;ref&gt;''The Chronicle of Novgorod'' (year AD 1068 AM 6576), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; according to the ''[[Novgorod First Chronicle|Chronicle of Novgorod]]''.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|pp=71-72}} However, Gleb and the Novgorodians routed him on the brook Gzen near the town.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=72}}{{sfn|Franklin|Shepard|1996|p=256}}

Gleb's rule in Novgorod was confirmed when his father became the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] in 1073.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=93}} According to the [[Hypatian Codex|Hypatian version]] of the ''Russian Primary Chronicle'', Gleb visited his father in [[Kiev]] and witnessed the death of the saintly Abbot [[Theodosius of Kiev|Feodosy]] of the Monastery of the Caves in 1074.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=95}} He seems to have been on friendly terms with his cousin, [[Vladimir Monomach]] whose first son was born in his court at Novgorod.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=97}} A late source{{mdash}}[[Vasily Tatishchev]]'s compilation of medieval chronicles{{mdash}}writes that Sviatoslav Iaroslavich appointed Gleb and Vladimir Monomach to command the Rus' troops sent to fight against the [[Bulgarians]] at [[Kherson|Cherson]] upon the request of the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Michael VII Ducas]], but the source's reliability is doubtful.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|pp=xv-xvi, 99}}

The ''Russian Primary Source'' narrates that a "[[Magician (paranormal)|magician]]"&lt;ref name="Russian_Primary_Chronicle_6579_154"&gt;''Russian Primary Chronicle'' (year 6579), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; arrived in Novgorod and stirred up the townsfolk against the [[Diocese of Novgorod and Staraya Russa|bishop]].{{sfn|Franklin|Shepard|1996|p=229}} The magician planned to murder the prelate but Gleb and his ''[[druzhina]]'' or retinue remained loyal to him.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=108}} Gleb dared the sorcerer who had stated that he could foretell the future to predict "what was about to happen that very day",&lt;ref name="Russian_Primary_Chronicle_6579_154"/&gt; according to the ''Russian Primary Chronicle''.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=108}} The magician declared that he would "perform great miracles",&lt;ref name="Russian_Primary_Chronicle_6579_154"/&gt; but Gleb pull out an axe from his cloth and killed him.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=108}} After the magician's death, his followers broke up.{{sfn|Franklin|Shepard|1996|p=246}}{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=108}}

Gleb's father died on 27 December 1076.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=127}} According to Novgorodian sources, the citizens of the town rose in revolt and dethroned Gleb in 1078.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=144}}{{sfn|Franklin|Shepard|1996|p=260}} He fled beyond the lands beyond the river [[Vishera River (Novgorod Oblast)|Volkhov]], known as Zavoloch'e, where the [[Chudes]] killed him on 30 May.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|pp=143-144}} His body was transferred to Chernigov where he was buried in the Holy Savior Cathedral on 23 July.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=143}} No source makes mention of Roman's marriage or his children, suggesting that he never married and died childless.{{sfn|Dimnik|1994|p=41}}

'''John Catterall "Jack" Leach''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|DSO|MVO}} (1 September 1894 – 10 December 1941) was a British naval officer. He was the only captain of the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} during her short period in service.

==The ''Bismarck''==
Very soon after the ''Prince of Wales'' entered active service in 1941, the ship fought under Leach's command in the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], and suffered damage fighting the [[German battleship Bismarck|German battleship ''Bismarck'']]. However, damage inflicted by the ''Prince of Wales'' caused the ''Bismarck'' to lose fuel, forcing the latter to attempt to return to a base in occupied France.

Despite a proposal to court-martial Leach for breaking off the action with the ''Bismarck'' after the ''Hood'' had sunk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Kennedy| first = Ludovic| authorlink =Ludovic Kennedy| title = Pursuit – The Sinking of the Bismarck| publisher = [[Book Club Associates]]| year = 1974| page = 212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Roskill| first = Stephen| authorlink =Stephen Roskill| title = Churchill and the Admirals| publisher = [[William Morrow &amp; Company]]| year = 1978| page = 125 &amp; 313}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| Kennedy expounds on the court martial claim via the epilogue in ''Pursuit - The Sinking of the Bismarck''. According to Kennedy the claim for a proposal to court martial Leach came from post war letters written by Admiral Tovey, after he retired, and not from Admiralty sources. Kennedy states in his epilogue that "...later in life Tovey's memory let him down..." and that plus the fact that Leach was retained in his command and given a commendation must cast considerable doubt on the court martial proposal.|group=Note}} he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Houtermann | first= Hans | title= Royal Navy (RN) Officers – 1939–1945 | work= | date= | url= http://www.unithistories.com/units_index/default.asp?file=../officers/personsx.html | accessdate=14 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960 film ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'' Leach was played by actor [[Esmond Knight]], who had been on the ''Prince of Wales''' bridge with Leach during the Battle of the Denmark Strait and was partially blinded when the ship was hit by ''Bismarck''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; gunfire.

==Force Z ==
In late 1941, ''Prince of Wales'' formed part of [[Force Z]] sent to [[Singapore]]. Off the coast of [[British Malaya|Malaya]], she was [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sunk]] by the [[Japan]]ese. Captain Leach apparently abandoned ''Prince of Wales'' at the very last minute, but did not survive the vessel's sinking. His body was seen floating in the water a short time after the sinking.

His son was [[Henry Leach]] (1923–2011), who was [[First Sea Lord]] of the Royal Navy during the [[Falklands War]].

{{terrorism}}
A '''lone wolf''', '''lone-wolf terrorist''', or '''lone actor''', is someone who prepares and commits violent acts alone, outside of any command structure and without material assistance from any group. He or she may be influenced or motivated by the ideology and beliefs of an external group and may act in support of such a group. In its original sense, a "[[Lone wolf (trait)|lone wolf]]" is an animal or person that generally lives or spends time alone instead of with a group.&lt;ref name="reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lone+wolf|title=Lone wolf - Define Lone wolf at Dictionary.com|work=[[Dictionary.com]]|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observers note the attacks are a relatively rare type of terrorist attack but have been increasing in number,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/lone-wolf-attacks-are-becoming-more-common-and-more-deadly/|title=Lone Wolf Attacks Are Becoming More Common -- And More Deadly|last=|first=|date=14 July 2016|work=|newspaper=FRONTLINE|language=en-US|access-date=4 February 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is sometimes difficult to tell whether an actor has received outside help and what appears to be a lone wolf attack may actually have been carefully orchestrated from outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/asia/isis-messaging-app-terror-plot.html|title=Not 'Lone Wolves' After All: How ISIS Guides World's Terror Plots From Afar|last=Callimachi|first=Rukmini|date=4 February 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gartenstein-Ross|first=Daveed|last2=Barr|first2=Nathaniel|date=26 July 2016|year=|title=The Myth of Lone-Wolf Terrorism|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/western-europe/2016-07-26/myth-lone-wolf-terrorism|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=|pages=|via=|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The term "lone wolf" was popularized by [[white supremacist]]s Alex Curtis and [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]] in the 1990s. Metzger advocated individual or small-cell underground activity, as opposed to above-ground membership organizations, envisaging "warriors acting alone or in small groups who attacked the government or other targets in 'daily, anonymous acts.'"&lt;ref name="Adl.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Metzger.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=7 |title=Tom Metzger and White Aryan Resistance (WAR) – Extremism in America |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925190751/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Metzger.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=7 |archivedate=25 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimmel|first1=Michael|title=Angry White Men: American Masculinity at the End of an Era|date=2013|publisher=Avalon|isbn=1568585136|pages=228–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism expert Brian Michael Jenkins of the [[RAND Corporation]] prefers the term ''stray dog'' to ''lone wolf''. According to Jenkins, most individuals involved in such attacks "skulk about, sniffing at violence, vocally aggressive but skittish without backup".&lt;ref name="Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel |first1=Jacob |title=Lone Wolves, Terrorist Runts, and the Stray Dogs of ISIS |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/24/in-canada-the-stray-dogs-of-isis.html |accessdate=7 November 2014 |work=[[Daily Beast]] |date=24 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archivedate=7 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107133653/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/24/in-canada-the-stray-dogs-of-isis.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though these individuals seem to be acting alone, there are often ties between lone wolves and terrorist organisations for example, terrorist backed online content.&lt;ref&gt;: http://doi.org/10.15664/jtr.405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage==
The term "lone wolf" is used by [[List of law enforcement agencies#United States|US law enforcement agencies]] and the media to refer to individuals undertaking violent acts of terrorism outside a command structure. The [[FBI]] and [[San Diego Police]]'s investigation into the activities of a self-professed white supremacist, Alex Curtis, was named [[Operation Lone Wolf]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.fbi.gov/sandiego/about-us/history/operation-lone-wolf|title=Operation Lone Wolf|publisher=[[FBI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "largely due to Curtis' encouragement of other white supremacists to follow what Curtis refers to as 'lone wolf' activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Lone Wolf|url=https://www.fbi.gov/sandiego/about-us/history/operation-lone-wolf|publisher=FBI|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term lone wolf is used to distinguish terrorist actions carried out by individuals from those coordinated by large groups.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Lone Wolf Terrorism: Global Patterns, Motivations and Prevention|last=Spaaij|first=Ramon|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Terrorist attacks that are carried out by small cells are not classified as lone wolf attacks. Lone wolf attacks are far more rare than attacks carried out by groups. Since 1940, there have only been around 100 successful lone wolf attacks in the United States.'''&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/lone-wolf-attacks-are-becoming-more-common-and-more-deadly/|title=Lone Wolf Attacks Are Becoming More Common And More Deadly|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''The number of attacks is increasing, however, and has grown each year since 2000. Lone wolves generally come from different demographics than far right attackers as well. As compared to those on the far right, lone wolf attackers who become inspired by al-Qaeda and ISIS tend to be younger and better educated. According to studies, lone wolves have more in common with [[mass murder]]ers than they do with members of the organized terrorist groups that often inspire them.

While the lone wolf acts to advance the ideological or philosophical beliefs of an extremist group, they act on their own, without any outside command or direction. The lone wolf's tactics and methods are conceived and directed solely on their own; in many cases, such as the tactics described by Curtis, the lone wolf never has personal contact with the group they identify with. As such, it is considerably more difficult for [[counter-terrorism]] officials to gather intelligence on lone wolves, since they may not come into contact with routine counter-terrorist surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://icct.nl/publication/understanding-lone-wolves-towards-a-theoretical-framework-for-comparative-analysis/ | title=Understanding Lone Wolves: Towards a Theoretical Framework for Comparative Analysis | author1=Jan Leenaars | author2=Dr. Alastair Reed | publisher=The [[International Centre for Counter-Terrorism]] – The Hague (ICCT) | date=2 May 2016 | accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 analysis by Sarah Teich, a research assistant at the [[International Institute for Counter-Terrorism]], found five emerging trends in Islamist lone wolf terrorism in North America and western Europe between 1990 and 2013:
*An increase in the number of countries targeted by lone wolves from the 1990s to the 2000s.
*An increase in the number of people injured and killed by lone wolves.
*Increased effectiveness of law enforcement and counter-terrorism.
*Consistency in the distribution of attacks by "actor types" (loners, lone wolves, and lone wolf packs).
*An increase in the number of attacks against military personnel.&lt;ref name="ict.org.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ict.org.il/Article.aspx?ID=691|title=Trends and Developments in Lone Wolf Terrorism in the Western World|last=Teich|first=Sarah|date=October 2013|publisher=[[International Institute for Counter-Terrorism]]|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, lone wolves may present a greater threat than organized groups, and terrorists have not been limited to Muslims. According to the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]],'' "With the exception of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|attacks on the World Trade Center]], experts say the major terrorist attacks in the United States have been perpetrated by deranged individuals who were sympathetic to a larger cause – from [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma City bomber]] [[Timothy McVeigh]] to the Washington area sniper [[John Allen Muhammad]]," both native-born Americans.&lt;ref name="Csmonitor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0527/p02s02-usju.html |title=Lone wolves pose explosive terror threat |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=27 May 2003 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', counter-terrorism officials refer to "lone individuals known to authorities but not considered important enough to escalate investigations" as "known wolves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/f7795146-10a8-11e7-a88c-50ba212dce4d |title='Known wolf' attackers force intelligence rethink |first=Sam |last=Jones |date=24 March 2017 |work=Financial Times |accessdate=2 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups actively advocate lone wolf actions. Anti-abortion [[Militant (word)|militant]] terrorist group The [[Army of God (USA)|Army of God]] uses "[[leaderless resistance]]" as its organizing principle.&lt;ref name="Jennifer Gonnerman"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer Gonnerman |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-11-10/news/the-terrorist-campaign-against-abortion/3 |title=Villagvoice.com |publisher=Villagevoice.com |date=10 November 1998 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', in news analysis of the [[Boston Marathon bombings]], the Al-Qaeda activist [[Samir Khan]], publishing in ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'', advocated individual terrorist actions directed at Americans and published detailed recipes online.&lt;ref name=NYT5513&gt;{{cite news|title=A Homemade Style of Terror: Jihadists Push New Tactics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/us/terrorists-find-online-education-for-attacks.html|accessdate=6 May 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 May 2013|author=Scott Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misidentification===
Lone wolf terrorists are frequently thought to only be Muslims, however, this is not always the case. Lone wolf terrorists may sympathize with and consider themselves part of larger groups, but they are not truly a part of them.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Lone Wolf Terrorism: Global Patterns, Motivations and Prevention|last=Spaaij|first=Ramon|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' Often, the attacks are attributed to people who have a mixture of political and personal grievances. The attackers can have no actual affiliation to the group that claims them, but instead become radicalized online and through external media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Global|first=IndraStra|title=OPINION {{!}} What Drives Lone Offenders?|url=http://www.indrastra.com/2017/10/OPINION-What-Drives-Lone-Offenders-003-10-2017-0005.html|journal=IndraStra|issn=2381-3652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of terrorists determined by authorities to have been lone wolf attacks inspired by [[ISIS]] and/or its ideology, were later found to have been recruited, trained and directed remotely by ISIL to carry out the attacks.&lt;ref name="NotLoneWolf"&gt;{{cite news|title=Not 'Lone Wolves' After All: How ISIS Guides World's Terror Plots From Afar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/asia/isis-messaging-app-terror-plot.html |accessdate=5 February 2017 |publisher=New York Times |date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health factors==
Lone wolf terrorists are highly likely to be afflicted by a mental illness. Studies have found that more than 40% of lone wolf terrorists have been diagnosed at some point in their life with a mental illness.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; This puts lone wolves as being 13.5 times more likely to suffer from a mental illness than a member of an organized terrorist group, such as al-Qaeda or ISIS.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/lone-wolf-terrorism|title=Lone Wolf Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental health challenges are thought to make some individuals among the many who suffer from certain "psychological disturbances," vulnerable to being inspired by extremist ideologies to commit acts of lone wolf terrorism.&lt;ref name="MentalIllnessKayFactor"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental Illness: A Key Factor in "Terror"|url=http://bridge.georgetown.edu/mental-illness-a-key-factor-in-terror/|accessdate=16 February 2017|agency=Johns Hopkins University|publisher=Bridge Initiative Team|date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LoneWoldTerrorism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alfaro-Gonzalez|first1=Lydia|title=Report: Lone Wolf Terrorism|date=27 July 2015|publisher=Security Studies Program, Natoonal Security Critical Issue Task Force|url=http://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NCITF-Final-Paper.pdf|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On 15 December 2014, [[2014 Sydney hostage crisis|a hostage crisis in the Lindt Café]] in [[Martin Place, Sydney]] ended with three deaths, including the suspect [[Man Haron Monis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fraser|first1=Jill|title=Australian expert warns of 'lone wolf' terror risk|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/news/437309--australian-expert-warns-of-lone-wolf-terror-risk|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=Anadolou Agency|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is doubt as to whether or not Monis fit the definition of a lone wolf terrorist. Queensland University of Technology criminologist Associate Professor Mark Lauchs said it was important the siege wasn't elevated to a "terrorist attack" as such. Associate Professor Lauchs said Monis was simply a deranged person running a hostage situation: "This incident was not about religion and neither was it a terrorist attack, but given that perception by the paraphernalia Monis used."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/man-haron-monis-why-did-he-carry-out-sydney-siege/story-fnj3rq0y-1227159748676|title=Man Haron Monis: Why did he carry out Sydney siege?|work=NewsComAu|accessdate=17 July 2015|date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian [[Prime Minister]] Tony Abbott said, "[Man Haron Monis] had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability. As the siege unfolded yesterday, he sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] death cult." Former counter-terrorism adviser to the White House Richard Clarke said, "I don't think this was a lone wolf terrorist, I don't think this was a terrorist at all, I think this was someone who was committing suicide by police as a lot of people with mental problems do, and now, if they say they're a terrorist, if they say they're somehow associated with ISIS or Al Qaeda, it becomes a major event that shuts down the city and gets international attention. This was a person with a mental problem who tried to gain attention and succeeded, tried to shut down the city and succeeded, merely by putting up a flag that was something like the flag of ISIS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1684772/experts-say-sydney-hostage-taker-man-haron-monis-wasnt-a-terrorist-just-a-man-with-mental-problems/|title=Experts Say Sydney Hostage Taker Man Haron Monis Wasn't A Terrorist, Just A Man With Mental Problems|work=The Inquisitr News|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lump''' (1956 – 29 March 1973), was a [[Dachshund]] owned by [[David Douglas Duncan]] who lived with artist [[Pablo Picasso]] for six years, and featured in several of his works.

==Early life==
Born in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]], and named after the German word for "rascal", the dog was acquired by David Douglas Duncan, an American photographer.&lt;ref name=othermuse /&gt; Lump was purchased at the age of three months from a German family in order to act as a companion for Duncan's [[Afghan Hound]], Kubla. The two dogs did not get along well, with the larger Afghan treating Lump much like a toy, rolling him around Duncan's apartment.&lt;ref name=picassofellforadachshund /&gt;

==Pablo Picasso==
[[File:PabloPicasso Meninas.jpg|thumb|right|One of Picasso's [[Las Meninas (Picasso)|recreations]] of ''Las Meninas'', featuring Lump in place of the original dog]]
Lump first met [[Picasso]] on 19 April 1957 at La Californie, Picasso's hillside mansion in [[Cannes]]. His owner, David Douglas Duncan, had photographed Picasso for the first time during the previous year. On this occasion he chose to bring along Lump, as the Dachshund didn't get along with his other dog.&lt;ref name=othermuse/&gt; While having lunch with his future wife [[Jacqueline Roque]] and Duncan, Picasso enquired if the dog had ever had a plate of his own. When Duncan responded no, Picasso picked up a brush and paint that were on the table and painted a portrait of Lump on his own dinner plate. With the work dated and inscribed to Lump, he handed the plate to Duncan as a gift.&lt;ref name=plateransomcenter&gt;{{cite news|title=Plate painted by Pablo Picasso donated to Ransom Center by photojournalist Duncan|url=http://www.utexas.edu/opa/blogs/culturalcompass/2011/01/26/lump/|accessdate=20 February 2011|newspaper=Harry Ransom Center|date=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog felt immediately at home and stayed with Picasso for the next six years at La Californie, living with Picasso's [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]] Yan and a [[goat]] named Esmeralda.&lt;ref name=othermuse/&gt; Duncan spoke of Lump and Picasso, "This was a love affair. Picasso would take Lump in his arms. He would feed him from his hand. Hell, that little dog just took over. He ran the damn house."&lt;ref name=picassofellforadachshund /&gt;

Duncan would return to visit Picasso during this time, and photographed the artist with Lump on several occasions along with Picasso's children. While Picasso preferred to work alone, he would often be accompanied by Lump. In one series of photographs, he made a rabbit out of a sugar impregnated cardboard cake box for the dog, who carried it into the garden to eat.&lt;ref name=othermuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=picassofellforadachshund&gt;{{cite news|title=How Picasso fell for a dachshund|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/how-picasso-fell-for-a-dachshund-476276.html|accessdate=20 February 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=1 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Duncan spoke of Lump's stay with Picasso, "Lump had an absolutely pampered life there. Picasso once said, ‘Lump, he’s not a dog, he’s not a little man, he’s somebody else.’ Picasso had many dogs, but Lump was the only one he took in his arms."&lt;ref name=othermuse/&gt;

In 1964, during a visit with Picasso, Duncan was informed that Lump was unwell. The dog was suffering from a spinal condition leaving him without the use of his back legs and was being looked after by a local vet in Cannes. Duncan visited the vet and was informed that the condition could not be cured, and the vet was no longer feeding him.&lt;ref name=picassofellforadachshund /&gt; Duncan sought a second opinion, taking back the dog, he drove it to [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]], where he found a vet who was willing to treat Lump. The treatment took several months, but Lump would go on to live for another ten years, albeit walking as Duncan would describe "a bit like a drunken sailor".&lt;ref name=picassofellforadachshund /&gt; He died ten days before Picasso, on 29 March 1973.&lt;ref name=othermuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=picassofellforadachshund /&gt;

==Legacy==
The painted plate that Picasso created on their first meeting was donated to the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] by Duncan in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |title=Man (In This Case, Picasso) Paints Dog |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/man-in-this-case-picasso-paints-dog/ |accessdate=20 February 2011 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar painted plates have sold at auction for between $20,000 to $90,000.&lt;ref name=plateransomcenter/&gt;

Picasso painted [[Las Meninas (Picasso)|44 studies]] of [[Diego Velázquez]]'s painting ''[[Las Meninas]]'' between 17 August and 30 December 1957; Lump appeared in 15 of them.&lt;ref name=othermuse&gt;{{cite news|last=Riding|first=Alan|title=Picasso’s Other Muse, of the Dachshund Kind|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/26/arts/design/26lump.html|accessdate=20 February 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series were donated to the [[Museu Picasso]] in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref name=picassofellforadachshund /&gt;

Lump was mentioned in ''[[Epic Rap Battles of History]]'' during the battle between Picasso and [[Bob Ross]].

== Families ==
As of early 2016, there are three families belonging to the MACPF superfamily:
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.12 1.C.12] - [[Cholesterol-dependent cytolysin|The Thiol-activated Cholesterol-dependent Cytolysin (CDC) Family]]
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39 1.C.39] - The Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) Family
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.97 1.C.97] - [[Pleurotolysin|The Pleurotolysin Pore-forming (Pleurotolysin) Family]]

=== Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) Family  ===
Proteins containing MACPF domains play key roles in vertebrate immunity, embryonic development, and neural-cell migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Disparate proteins use similar architectures to damage membranes|journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date = 2008-10-01|issn = 0968-0004|pmid = 18778941|pages = 482–490|volume = 33|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2008.07.004|first = Gregor|last = Anderluh|first2 = Jeremy H.|last2 = Lakey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth component of complement and perforin form oligomeric pores that lyse bacteria and kill virus-infected cells, respectively. The crystal structure of a bacterial MACPF protein, Plu-MACPF from ''Photorhabdus luminescens'' was determined ({{PDB|2QP2}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A common fold mediates vertebrate defense and bacterial attack|journal = Science |date = 2007-09-14|issn = 1095-9203|pmid = 17717151|pages = 1548–1551|volume = 317|issue = 5844|doi = 10.1126/science.1144706|first = Carlos J.|last = Rosado|first2 = Ashley M.|last2 = Buckle|first3 = Ruby H.

A representative list of proteins belonging to the MACPF family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39.9 Transporter Classification Database].

== Biological roles of MACPF domain containing proteins ==
Many proteins belonging to the MACPF superfamily play key roles in plant and animal immunity.

[[Complement system|Complement proteins]] C6-C9 all contain a MACPF domain and assemble into the membrane attack complex.  C6, C7 and C8β appear to be non-lytic and function as scaffold proteins within the MAC. In contrast both C8α and C9 are capable of lysing cells. The final stage of MAC formation involves polymerisation of C9 into a large pore that punches a hole in the outer membrane of [[gram-negative bacteria]].

[[Perforin]] is stored in granules within cytotoxic T-cells and is responsible for killing virally infected and transformed cells. Perforin functions via two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, like C9, high concentrations of perforin can form pores that lyse cells. Secondly, perforin permits delivery of the cytotoxic granzymes A and B into target cells. Once delivered, granzymes are able to induce apoptosis and cause target cell death.&lt;ref name="Voskoboinik I, Smyth MJ, Trapani JA 2006 940–52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kaiserman D, Bird CH, Sun J, etal |title=The major human and mouse granzymes are structurally and functionally divergent |journal=J.

The plant protein CAD1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39.11.3 TC# 1.C.39.11.3]) functions in the plant immune response to bacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Morita-Yamamuro C, Tsutsui T, Sato M, etal |title=The Arabidopsis gene CAD1 controls programmed cell death in the plant immune system and encodes a protein containing a MACPF domain |journal=Plant Cell Physiol. |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=902–12 |year=2005 |pmid=15799997 |doi=10.1093/pcp/pci095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Salicylic acid and a chitin elicitor both control expression of the CAD1 gene involved in the plant immunity of Arabidopsis|journal = Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry|date = 2006-09-01|issn = 0916-8451|pmid = 16960394|pages = 2042–2048|volume = 70|issue = 9|doi = 10.1271/bbb.50700|first = Tomokazu|last = Tsutsui|first2 = Chizuko|last2 = Morita-Yamamuro|first3 = Yutaka|last3 = Asada|first4 = Eiichi|last4 = Minami|first5 = Naoto|last5 = Shibuya|first6 = Akira|last6 = Ikeda|first7 = Junji|last7 = Yamaguchi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sea anemone]] ''Actineria villosa'' uses a MACPF (AvTX-60A; [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39.10.1 TC# 1.C.39.10.1])protein as a lethal toxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Oshiro N, Kobayashi C, Iwanaga S, etal |title=A new membrane-attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain lethal toxin from the nematocyst venom of the Okinawan sea anemone Actineria villosa |journal=Toxicon |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=225–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15019483 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2003.11.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MACPF proteins are also important for the invasion of the [[Malarial]] parasite into the mosquito host and the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kadota K, Ishino T, Matsuyama T, Chinzei Y, Yuda M |title=Essential role of membrane-attack protein in malarial transmission to mosquito host |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=101 |issue=46 |pages=16310–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15520375 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0406187101 |pmc=524694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ishino T, Chinzei Y, Yuda M |title=A Plasmodium sporozoite protein with a membrane attack complex domain is required for breaching the liver sinusoidal cell layer prior to hepatocyte infection |journal=Cell.

Not all MACPF proteins function in defence or attack.  For example, [[astrotactin|astrotactin-1]] ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.87.3.1 TC# 9.B.87.3.1]) is involved in neural cell migration in mammals and apextrin ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39.7.4 TC# 1.C.39.7.4]) is involved in sea urchin (''[[Heliocidaris erythrogramma]]'') development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zheng C, Heintz N, Hatten ME |title=CNS gene encoding astrotactin, which supports neuronal migration along glial fibers |journal=Science |volume=272 |issue=5260 |pages=417–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8602532 |doi=10.1126/science.272.5260.417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haag ES, Sly BJ, Andrews ME, Raff RA |title=Apextrin, a novel extracellular protein associated with larval ectoderm evolution in Heliocidaris erythrogramma |journal=Dev.

Functionally uncharacterised MACPF proteins are sporadically distributed in bacteria. Several species of ''Chlamydia'' contain MACPF proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ponting CP |title=Chlamydial homologues of the MACPF (MAC/perforin) domain |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=9 |issue=24 |pages=R911–3 |year=1999 |pmid=10608922 |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(00)80102-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The insect pathogenic bacteria ''[[Photorhabdus luminescens]]'' also contains a MACPF protein, however, this molecule appears non-lytic.&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt;

==Structure and mechanism==
The X-ray crystal structure of Plu-MACPF, a protein from the [[insect]] pathogenic [[enterobacteria]] ''[[Photorhabdus luminescens]]'' has been determined (figure 1).[http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2QP2]  These data reveal that the MACPF domain is homologous to [[pore forming toxins|pore forming]] cholesterol dependent cytolysins (CDC's) from [[Gram positive|gram-positive]] pathogenic bacteria such as ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' (which causes [[gas gangrene]]).  The [[amino acid]] sequence identity between the two families is extremely low, and the relationship is not detectable using conventional sequence based data mining techniques.&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt;

It is suggested that MACPF proteins and CDCs form pores in the same way (figure 1).&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt; Specifically it is hypothesised that MACPF proteins oligomerise to form a large circular pore (figure 2).   A concerted conformational change within each monomer then results in two [[Alpha helix|α-helical]] regions unwinding to form four [[amphipathic]] [[Beta sheet|β-strands]] that span the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] of the target cell.&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt;  Like CDC's MACPF proteins are thus β-pore forming toxins that act like a molecular hole punch.

Other crystal structures for members of the MACPF superfamily can be found in RCSB: i.e., {{PDB2|3KK7}}, {{PDB2|3QOS}}, {{PDB2|3QQH}}, {{PDB2|3RD7}}, {{PDB2|3OJY}}

==Control of MACPF proteins==
Complement regulatory proteins such as [[CD59]] function as [[membrane attack complex|MAC]] inhibitors and prevent inappropriate activity of complement against self cells (Figure 3).  Biochemical studies have revealed the peptide sequences in C8α and C9 that bind to CD59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang Y, Qiao F, Abagyan R, Hazard S, Tomlinson S |title=Defining the CD59-C9 binding interaction |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=281 |issue=37 |pages=27398–404 |year=2006 |pmid=16844690 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M603690200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lockert DH, Kaufman KM, Chang CP, Hüsler T, Sodetz JM, Sims PJ |title=Identity of the segment of human complement C8 recognized by complement regulatory protein CD59 |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=270 |issue=34 |pages=19723–8 |year=1995 |pmid=7544344 |doi=10.1074/jbc.270.8.3483}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysis of the MACPF domain structures reveals that these sequences map to the second cluster of helices that unfurl to span the membrane. It is therefore suggested that CD59 directly inhibits the MAC by interfering with conformational change in one of the membrane spanning regions.&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt;

Other proteins that bind to the MAC include C8γ. This protein belongs to the [[lipocalin]] family and interacts with C8α. The binding site on C8α is known, however, the precise role of C8γ in the MAC remains to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Schreck SF, Plumb ME, Platteborze PL, etal |title=Expression and characterization of recombinant subunits of human complement component C8: further analysis of the function of C8 alpha and C8 gamma |journal=J.

==Role in human disease==
Deficiency of C9, or other components of the MAC results in an increased susceptibility to diseases caused by [[Gram negative|gram-negative]] bacteria such as [[meningococcal]] [[meningitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kira R, Ihara K, Takada H, Gondo K, Hara T |title=Nonsense mutation in exon 4 of human complement C9 gene is the major cause of Japanese complement C9 deficiency |journal=Hum.

Most notably, deficiency of the MAC inhibitor CD59 results in an overactivity of complement and [[Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walport |first=Mark J. |authorlink=Mark Walport|title=Complement.

'''Margaret Elizabeth Buchanan''' (1864-1940) has been described{{by whom|date=October 2018}} as the most important pioneer of women in pharmacy.

Her father was a doctor and she was educated at [[North London Collegiate School]]. She qualified as a pharmacist in 1887 and passed the Major examination in 1888, gaining a silver medal and taking second place in the [[Pereira competition]]. 

She started as a hospital pharmacist at the Westminster General Infirmary and took over Henry Deane's pharmacy at 16 The Pavement, [[Clapham Common]] sometime between 1911 and 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hudson|first1=Briony|last2=Boylan|first2=Maureen|title=The School of Pharmacy, University of London: Medicines, Science and Society, 1842-2012|date=2013|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=0124076904|page=67|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1e2tPp10UKAC&amp;dq=Margaret++Buchanan+pharmacist&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Agnes Borrowman became a partner and the practice trained generations of woman pharmacists.  By 1923 of the 15 young women from the business who studied at the Pharmaceutical Society School of Pharmacy 14 had taken prizes and scholarships.

In 1924 she transferred the business to Borrowman and founded the Margaret Buchanan School of Pharmacy for Women at Gordon Hall, [[Gordon Square]].  She offered a 10 month’s course for the examination of the [[Society of Apothecaries]] for £21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrating Women in Pharmacy|url=https://www.nawp.org.uk/pdf/June_2016_Newsletter.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2018|publisher=NAWP Newsletter|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was one of the founders of the [[National Association of Women Pharmacists]], becoming its President, and was, in 1918, the first woman to be elected to the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society, serving until 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rayner-Canham|first1=Marlene|last2=Rayner-Canham|first2=Geoffrey|title=Chemistry Was Their Life: Pioneering British Women Chemists, 1880-1949|date=2008|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=1860949878|page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

[[Reporters Without Borders]] investigated the event and found that the army had not interviewed eyewitnesses.&lt;ref name=ifex /&gt; The soldiers had been questioned, but nobody was punished. Palestinian Authority stated that Israel had "committed a war crime" by "opening fire on journalists and other civilians".&lt;ref name="age"/&gt;

The Associated Press reported two Palestinian cameramen: Hassan Titi from [[Reuters]] and Sami al-Assi from a Palestinian station. Both cameramen said the soldier aimed at the journalists. 
Video footage taken by [[Reuters]] confirms a soldier kneeling by a tank pointing a rifle down the alley where the journalists were wearing the green bulletproof vests stating, ''Press.'' Nazeh Darwazeh fell to his death shortly after the soldier fired.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;

Nazeh Darwazi was covering the Passover clashes in Nablus when he was killed.&lt;ref name="age"/&gt;  Israeli troops arrested several Palestinians in Nablus on suspicion of a planning a potential suicide attack during Passover. Three of the four were arrested around Casbah; the fourth turned himself in at a military checkpoint. In Rafah, five Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops during a raid of a nearby refugee camp in the southern Gaza strip. Twenty-seven people total were wounded in the raid. At the time, Palestinian leader, [[Yasir Arafat]] was in a dispute with his handpicked prime minister, [[Mahmoud Abbas]], over the formation of a new government.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=age /&gt;

==Reaction==
On Monday April 23, 2003 in front of the international Red Cross headquarters in Al-Khalil district, a group of Palestinian journalists staged a sit-in to publicly declare their disgust with what happened. The Palestinian Authority accused the IDF of war crimes.&lt;ref name=dawn /&gt;

Reporters Without Borders, which is based in France, urged President [[Jacques Chirac]] to bring the issue of journalist security and safety up when he met with Israeli [[Moshe Katzav]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=ABCAustralia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-02-15/watchdog-seeks-assurances-of-media-safety-from/135902 |title=Watchdog seeks assurances of media safety from Israel - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2004-02-15 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Committee to Protect Journalists]] issued statement about Nazeh Darwazi's death. Joel Simon, CPJ, said, "We demand an immediate and thorough inquiry into the shooting death of Nazih Darwazeh and call on you to ensure that those responsible are swiftly brought to justice."&lt;ref name=CPJreacts&gt;{{cite web|first=Joel |last=Simon |title=CPJ outragedby shooting death of Palestinian cameraman  |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=April 22, 2003|accessdate=2014-14-19 |url=http://cpj.org/2003/04/cpj-outragedby-shooting-death-of-palestinian-camer.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazeh Darwazi’s body was wrapped in the Palestinian and carried from the Rafidyeh hospital by representatives of the Palestinian press. Those carrying Darwazi chanted against Israel. They carried his body to the funeral, which over one thousand people attended.&lt;ref name=dawn /&gt;

A '''Neural Turing machine''' ('''NTMs''') is a [[recurrent neural network]] model published by [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] et. al. in 2014.&lt;ref name="arxiv" /&gt; NTMs combine the fuzzy [[pattern matching]] capabilities of [[neural network]]s with the [[algorithm]]ic power of [[programmable computer]]s. An NTM has a neural network controller coupled to [[Auxiliary memory|external memory]] resources, which it interacts with through attentional mechanisms. The memory interactions are differentiable end-to-end, making it possible to optimize them using [[gradient descent]].&lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_May_17_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-minds-interview-googles-alex-graves-koray-sophie-curtis |title=Deep Minds: An Interview with Google's Alex Graves &amp; Koray Kavukcuoglu |newspaper= |date=  |author= |accessdate= May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An NTM with a [[long short-term memory]] (LSTM) network controller can infer simple algorithms such as copying, sorting, and associative recall from input and output examples.&lt;ref name="arxiv"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1410.5401|title= Neural Turing Machines |newspaper= |date=  |author= |last1= Graves |first1= Alex |last2= Wayne |first2= Greg |last3= Danihelka |first3= Ivo |class= cs.NE |year= 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can infer algorithms from input and output examples alone.

'''Neuromodulation''' is "the alteration of nerve activity through targeted delivery of a stimulus, such as electrical stimulation or chemical agents, to specific neurological sites in the body".  It is carried out to normalize – or modulate – [[nervous tissue]] function. Neuromodulation is an evolving therapy that can involve a range of electromagnetic stimuli such as a magnetic field ([[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|rTMS]]), an [[electric current]], or a drug instilled directly in the subdural space (intrathecal drug delivery). Emerging applications involve targeted introduction of genes or gene regulators and light ([[optogenetics]]), and by 2014, these had been at minimum demonstrated in mammalian models, or first-in-human data had been acquired.&lt;ref name=INS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.neuromodulation.com/|title= International Neuromodulation Society home page|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most clinical experience has been with electrical stimulation.

Neuromodulation, whether electrical or magnetic, employs the body's natural biological response by stimulating nerve cell activity that can influence populations of nerves by releasing transmitters, such as [[dopamine]], or other chemical messengers such as the [[peptide]] [[Substance P]], that can modulate the excitability and firing patterns of neural circuits. There may also be more direct electrophysiological effects on neural membranes as the mechanism of action of electrical interaction with neural elements. The end effect is a "normalization" of a neural network function from its perturbed state. Presumed mechanisms of action for neurostimulation include depolarizing blockade, stochastic normalization of [[neural firing]], [[axonal blockade]], reduction of neural firing keratosis, and suppression of neural network oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Karas | first1 = Patrick J. | last2 = Mikell | first2 = Charles B. | last3 = Christian | first3 = Eisha | last4 = Liker | first4 = Mark A. | last5 = Sheth | first5 = Sameer A. | title = Deep brain stimulation: a mechanistic and clinical update. | journal = Neurosurgical Focus | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = E1 |date=2013 | url = http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2013.9.FOCUS13383 | doi = 10.3171/2013.9.focus13383| PMID = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact mechanisms of neurostimulation are not known, the empirical effectiveness has led to considerable application clinically.

==Invasive electrical neuromodulation methods==

Electrical stimulation using implantable devices came into modern usage in the 1980s and its techniques and applications have continued to develop and expand.&lt;ref name=krames&gt;Krames, Elliot S.; Peckham, P. Hunter; Rezai, Ali R., eds. (2009). Neuromodulation, Vol. 1-2. Academic Press. pp. 1–1200. {{ISBN|9780123742483}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
These are methods where an operation is required to position an electrode. The stimulator, with the battery, similar to a pacemaker, may also be implanted, or may remain outside the body.

In general, neuromodulation systems deliver electrical currents and typically consist of the following components: An epidural, subdural or parenchymal electrode placed via minimally invasive needle techniques (so-called percutaneous leads) or an open surgical exposure to the target (surgical "paddle" or "grid" electrodes), or stereotactic implants for the central nervous system, and an implanted pulse generator (IPG).  Depending on the distance from the electrode access point an extension cable may also be added into the system. The IPG can have either a non-rechargeable battery needing replacement every 2–5 years (depending on stimulation parameters) or a rechargeable battery that is replenished via an external inductive charging system.

Although most systems operate via delivery of a constant train of stimulation, there is now the advent of so-called "feed-forward" stimulation where the device's activation is contingent on a physiological event, such as an epileptic seizure. In this circumstance, the device is activated and delivers a desynchronizing pulse to the cortical area that is undergoing an epileptic seizure. This concept of feed-forward stimulation will likely become more prevalent as physiological markers of targeted diseases and neural disorders are discovered and verified.&lt;ref name="pmid18164485"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun FT, Morrell MJ, Wharen RE | title = Responsive cortical stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 68–74 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18164485 | pmc = 5084128 | doi = 10.1016/j.nurt.2007.10.069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The on-demand stimulation may contribute to longer battery life, if sensing and signal-processing demands of the system are sufficiently power-efficient. New electrode designs could yield more efficient and precise stimulation, requiring less current and minimizing unwanted side-stimulation. In addition, to overcome the challenge of preventing lead migration in areas of the body that are subject to motion such as turning and bending, researchers are exploring developing small stimulation systems that are recharged wirelessly rather than through an electrical lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last1 = Deer | first1 = T.R. | last2 = Krames | first2 = E. | last3 = Mekhail | first3 = N. | last4 = Pope | first4 = J. | last5 = Leong | first5 = M. | last6 = Stanton-Hicks | first6 = M. | last7 = Golovac | first7 = S. | last8 = Kaprual | first8 = L. | last9 = Alo | first9 = K. | last10 = Anderson | first10 = J. | last11 = Foreman | first11 = R.D. | last12 = Caraway | first12 = D. | last13 = Narouze | first13 = S. | last14 = Linderoth | first14 = B. | last15 = Buvanendran | first15 = A. | last16 = Feler | first16 = C. | last17 = Poree | first17 = L. | last18 = Lynch | first18 = P. | last19 = McJunkin | first19 = T. | last20 = Swing | first20 = T. | last21 = Staats | first21 = P. | last22 = Liem | first22 = L. | last23 = Williams | first23 = K. | title = The Appropriate Use of Neurostimulation: New and Evolving Neurostimulation Therapies and Applicable Treatment for Chronic Pain and Selected Disease States. | journal = Neuromodulation | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 599–615 |date=Jan 2008 | doi = 10.1111/ner.12204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinal cord stimulation===

{{main|Spinal cord stimulation}}
[[Spinal cord stimulation]] is a form of invasive neuromodulation therapy in common use since the 1980s. Its principal use is as a reversible, non-pharmacological therapy for [[chronic pain]] management that delivers mild electrical pulses to the [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mekhail NA, Cheng J, Narouze S, Kapural L, Mekhail MN, Deer T | year = 2010 | title = Clinical applications of neurostimulation: forty years later | url = | journal = Pain Pract. | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 103–112 | doi=10.1111/j.1533-2500.2009.00341.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In patients who experience pain reduction of 50 percent or more during a temporary trial, a permanent implant may be offered in which, as with a [[cardiac pacemaker]], an implantable pulse generator about the size of a stopwatch is placed under the skin on the trunk. It delivers mild impulses along slender electrical leads leading to small electrical contacts, about the size of a grain of rice, at the area of the spine to be stimulated.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Madeleine. [http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/399395/A-remote-control-turns-off-my-spine "A remote control turns off my spine"], London, UK. The Express. May 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stimulation is typically in the 20–200&amp;nbsp;Hz range, though a novel class of stimulation parameters are now emerging that employ a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz stimulation train as well as 500&amp;nbsp;Hz "burst stimulation". Kilohertz stimulation trains have been applied to both the spinal cord proper as well as the dorsal root ganglion in humans. All forms of spinal cord stimulation have been shown to have varying degrees of efficacy to address a variety of pharmacoresistant neuropathic or mixed (neuropathic and noiciceptive) pain syndromes such as post-laminectomy syndrome, low back pain, complex regional pain syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease and angina.&lt;ref name=NACC&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deer TR, Mekhail N, Provenzano D, Pope J, Krames E, Leong M, Levy RM, Abejon D, Buchser E, Burton A, Buvanendran A, Candido K, Caraway D, Cousins M, DeJongste M, Diwan S, Eldabe S, Gatzinsky K, Foreman RD, Hayek S, Kim P, Kinfe T, Kloth D, Kumar K, Rizvi S, Lad SP, Liem L, Linderoth B, Mackey S, McDowell G, McRoberts P, Poree L, Prager J, Raso L, Rauck R, Russo M, Simpson B, Slavin K, Staats P, Stanton-Hicks M, Verrills P, Wellington J, Williams K, North R|display-authors = 6 | title = The appropriate use of neurostimulation of the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system for the treatment of chronic pain and ischemic diseases: the Neuromodulation Appropriateness Consensus Committee | journal = Neuromodulation | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 515–50; discussion 550 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25112889 | doi = 10.1111/ner.12208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general process for spinal cord stimulation involves a temporary trailing of appropriate patients with an external pulse generator attached to epidural electrodes located in the lower thoracic spinal cord. The electrodes are placed either via a minimally invasive needle technique (so-called percutaneous leads) or an open surgical exposure (surgical "paddle" electrodes).

Patient selection is key, and candidates should pass rigorous psychological screening as well as a medical workup to assure that their pain syndrome is truly medication-resistant.&lt;ref name=NACC /&gt; After recuperating from the implant procedure, the patient will return to have the system turned on and programmed. Depending on the system, the program may elicit a tingling sensation that covers most of the painful area, replacing some of the painful sensations with more of a gentle massaging sensation, although other more recent systems do not create a tingling sensation. The patient is sent home with a handheld remote controller to turn the system off or on or switch between pre-set stimulation parameters, and can follow up to adjust the parameters.

===Deep brain stimulation===

{{main|Deep brain stimulation}}
Another invasive neuromodulation treatment developed in the 1980s is [[deep brain stimulation]], which may be used to help limit symptoms of movement disorder in [[Parkinson's disease]], [[dystonia]], or [[essential tremor]].&lt;ref name="Bronstein 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bronstein | first1 = JM. | last2 = Tagliati | first2 = M. | last3 = Alterman | first3 = RL. | last4 = Lozano | first4 = AM. | last5 = Volkmann | first5 = J. | last6 = Stefani | first6 = A. | last7 = Horak | first7 = FB. | last8 = Okun | first8 = MS. | last9 = Foote | first9 = KD. | displayauthors=8 | title = Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson disease: an expert consensus and review of key issues. | journal = Arch.

It has also shown promise for Tourette syndrome, torticollis, and tardive dyskinesia. DBS therapy, unlike spinal cord stimulation, has a variety of central nervous system targets, depending on the target pathology. For Parkinson's disease central nervous system targets include the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus interna, and the ventral intermidus nucleus of the thalamus. Dystonias are often treated by implants targeting globus pallidus interna, or less often, parts of the ventral thalamic group. The anterior thalamus is the target for epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilner |first=Andrew |date=22 April 2010 |title=Thalamic Stimulation: New Approach to Treatment of Epilepsy |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/720389 |newspaper=Medscape Neurology |location= |accessdate=Oct 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lozano-neuron-2013&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Lozano | first1 = Andres M. | last2 = Lipsman | first2 = Nir |title = Probing and Regulating Dysfunctional Circuits Using Deep Brain Stimulation. | journal = Neuron | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 406–424 |date=6 February 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.01.020 | PMID = | pmid=23395370}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=williams-okun-psych-2013&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Williams | first1 = Noaln R. | last2 = Okun | first2 = Michael S. |title = Deep brain stimulation (DBS) at the interface of neurology and psychiatry. | journal = J.

DBS research targets include, but are not limited to the following areas: Cg25 for depression, the anterior limb of the internal capsule for depression as well as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), centromedian/parafasicularis, centromedian thalamic nuclei and the subthalamic nucleus for OCD, anorexia and Tourette syndrome, the nucleus accumbens and ventral striatum have also been assayed for depression and pain.&lt;ref name="lozano-neuron-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=williams-okun-psych-2013/&gt;

==Non-invasive electrical methods==

These methods use external electrodes to apply a current to the body in order to change the functioning of the nervous system.

Methods include:
* [[Transcranial direct-current stimulation|Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)]]&lt;ref name="Feng 2013"/&gt;
* [[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation|Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)]]
* [[Electroconvulsive therapy|Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)]]

==Non-invasive magnetic methods==

Magnetic methods of neuromodulation are normally non-invasive: no surgery is required to allow a magnetic field to enter the body because the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]] of tissue is similar to that of air. In other words: magnetic field penetrate the body very easily.

The two main techniques are highly related in that both use changes in [[Magnetic flux|magnetic field strength]] to [[Electromagnetic induction|induce]] electric fields and [[ion]]ic currents in the body. There are however differences in approach and hardware. In rTMS the stimulation has a high amplitude (0.5–3 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]]), a low complexity and anatomical specificity is reached through a highly focal magnetic field. In tPEMF the stimulation has a low amplitude (0.01–500 millitesla), a high complexity and anatomical specificity is reached through the specific frequency content of the signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whissell PD, Persinger MA|title=Emerging synergisms between drugs and physiologically-patterned weak magnetic fields: implications for neuropharmacology and the human population in the twenty-first century.|journal=Curr.

==Invasive chemical methods==

Chemical neuromodulation is always invasive, because a drug is delivered in a highly specific location of the body. The non-invasive variant is traditional [[pharmacotherapy]], e.g. swallowing a tablet.

* [[Intrathecal]] drug delivery systems (ITDS, which may deliver micro-doses of painkiller (for instance, [[ziconotide]]) or anti-spasm medicine (such as [[baclofen]]) directly to the site of action)

==History==

Electrical stimulation of the nervous system has a long and complex history. Earlier practitioners of deep brain stimulation in the latter half of the 20th century (Delgado, Heath, Hosbuchi. See Hariz ''et al.'' for historical review&lt;ref name=hariz&gt;Hariz, Marwan I.; Blomstedt, Patric; Zrinzo, Ludvic. ''Neurosurg Focus'' 29 (2):E1 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) were limited by the technology available. Heath, in the 1950s, stimulated subcortical areas and made detailed observations of behavioral changes. A new understanding of pain perception was ushered in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in 1965, with the Gate Theory of Wall and Melzack.&lt;ref name = "Melzack&amp;Wall61–69"&gt;{{vcite book | author = Wall PD &amp; Melzack R | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The challenge of pain | edition = 2nd | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | year = 1996 | pages = 61–69 | isbn = 0-14-025670-9 | oclc = | doi = | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although now considered oversimplified, the theory held that pain transmissions from small nerve fibers can be overridden, or the gate "closed", by competing transmissions along the wider touch nerve fibers. Building on that concept, in 1967, the first dorsal column stimulator for pain control was demonstrated by Dr. Norm Shealy at Western Reserve Medical School, using a design adapted by Tom Mortimer, a graduate student at Case Institute of Technology, from cardiac nerve stimulators by Medtronic, Inc., where he had a professional acquaintance who shared the circuit diagram. In 1973, Hosbuchi reported alleviating the denervation facial pain of anesthesia dolorosa through ongoing electrical stimulation of the somatosensory thalamus, marking the start of the age of deep brain stimulation.&lt;ref name=krames/&gt;{{rp|13–16}}&lt;ref name=lozano-textbook-2009&gt;Textbook of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery, Volume 1 edited by Andres M. Lozano, Philip L. Gildenberg, Ronald R. Tasker. (2009) pp. 16 – 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bittar-meta-analysis&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bittar RG, Kar-Purkayastha I, Owen SL, etal | year = 2005 | title = Deep brain stimulation for pain relief: A meta-analysis | url = | journal = J. Clin. Neurosci. | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 515–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the limited clinical experience in these decades, that era is remarkable for the demonstration of the role technology has in neuromodulation, and there are some case reports of deep brain stimulation for a variety of problems; real or perceived. Delgado hinted at the power of neuromodulation with his implants in the bovine septal region and the ability of electrical stimulation to blunt or alter behavior. Further attempts at this "behavioral modification" in humans were difficult and seldom reliable, and contributed to the overall lack progress in central nervous system neuromodulation from that era. Attempts at intractable pain syndromes were met with more success, but again hampered by the quality of technology. In particular, the so-called DBS "zero" electrode, (consisting of a contact loop on its end) had an unacceptable failure rate and revisions were fraught with more risk than benefit. Overall, attempts at using electrical stimulation for "behavioral modification" were difficult and seldom reliable, slowing development of DBS. Attempts at addressing intractable pain syndromes with DBS were met with more success, but again hampered by the quality of technology. A number of physicians who hoped to address hitherto intractable problems sought development of more specialized equipment; for instance, in the 1960s, Wall's colleague Bill Sweet recruited engineer Roger Avery to make an implantable peripheral nerve stimulator. Avery started the Avery Company, which made a number of implantable stimulators. Shortly before his retirement in 1983, he submitted data requested by the FDA, which had begun to regulate medical devices following a 1977 meeting on the topic, regarding DBS for chronic pain. Medtronic and Neuromed also made deep brain stimulators at the time, but reportedly felt a complex safety and efficacy clinical trial in patients who were difficult to evaluate would be too costly for the size of the potential patient base, so did not submit clinical data on DBS for chronic pain to the FDA, and that indication was de-approved.&lt;ref name=krames/&gt;{{rp|13–16}}&lt;ref name=lozano-textbook-2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bittar-meta-analysis /&gt;

However, near this time in France and elsewhere, DBS was investigated as a substitute for lesioning of brain nuclei to control motor symptoms of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and by the mid-1990s, this reversible, non-destructive stimulation therapy had become the primary application of DBS in appropriate patients, to slow progression of movement impairment from the disease and reduce side effects from long-term, escalating medication use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Benabid | first1 = AL. | last2 = Chabardes | first2 = S. |last3 = Torres | first3 = N. | last4 = Piallat | first4 = B. | last5 = Krack | first5 = P. | last6 = Fraix | first6 = V. | last7 = Pollak | first7 = P.|title = Functional neurosurgery for movement disorders: a historial perspective. | journal = Prog.

In parallel to the development of neuromodulation systems to address motor impairment, cochlear implants were the first neuromodulation system to reach a broad commercial stage to address a functional deficit; they provide sound perception in users who are hearing-impaired due to missing or damaged sensory cells (cilia) in the inner ear. The approach to electrical stimulation used in cochlear implants was soon modified by one manufacturer, Boston Scientific Corporation, for design of electrical leads to be used in spinal cord stimulation treatment of chronic pain conditions.&lt;ref name=krames/&gt;{{rp|13–16}}

==Relationship to electroceuticals==

In 2012, the global pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline announced an initiative in bioelectric medicine in which the autonomic nervous system's impact on the immune system and inflammatory disease might be treated through electrical stimulation rather than pharmaceutical agents. The company's first investment in 2013 involved a small startup company, SetPoint Medical, which was developing neurostimulators to address inflammatory autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cookson |first=Clive |date=31 July 2012 |title=Healthcare: Into the cortex Scientific advances on the brain promise to transform the pharmaceutical industry |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/487fb69e-db1f-11e1-8074-00144feab49a.html |newspaper=Financial Times |location=London |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Famm |first=Kristoffer |last2=Litt |first2=Brian |last3=Tracey |first3=Kevin J. |last4=Boyden |first4=Edward S.|last5= Siaoui |first5= Moncef |date=11 April 2013 |title=Drug discovery: A jump-start for electroceuticals |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v496/n7444/full/496159a.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20130411 |journal=Nature |publisher= |volume= 496 |issue= |pages=159–161 |doi=10.1038/496159a |accessdate=12 October 2014 |pmid=23579662 |pmc=4179459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Carroll |title=GlaxoSmithKline stakes a pioneering effort to launch 'electroceutical' R&amp;D |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/glaxosmithkline-stakes-pioneering-effort-launch-electroceutical-rd/2013-04-10 |newspaper=Fierce Biotech |location= |date=10 April 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the electroceuticals quest aims to find the electro-neural signature of disease and at a cellular level, in real time, play back the more normal electro-signature to help maintain the neural signature in the normal state. Unlike preceding neuromodulation therapy methods, the approach would not involve electrical leads stimulating large nerves or spinal cords or brain centers. It might involve methods that are emerging within the neuromodulation family of therapies, such as optogenetics or some new nanotechnology. Disease states and conditions that have been discussed as targets for future electroceutical therapy include diabetes, infertility, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Birmingham |first1=Karen |authorlink1= |last2=Gradinaru |first2=Viviana |authorlink2= |last3=Anikeeva |first3=Polina |authorlink3= |last4=Grill |first4=Warren M. |last5=McLaughlin |first5=Bryan |last6=Pansricha |first6=Pankaj |last7=Weber |first7=Douglas |last8=Ludwig |first8=Kip |authorlink9= |last9=Kristoffer |first9=Famm |first10=Victor |last10=Pikov |title=Bioelectronic medicines: A research roadmap |script-title= |trans-title= |url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v13/n6/full/nrd4351.html  |journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery |type= |series= |language= |edition= |location= |publisher= |publication-date=30 May 2014 |volume=13 |pages=399–400 |doi=10.1038/nrd4351 |pmid=24875080 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ontetic Reduction''' is the name of final stage of reduction in the Transcendent Method as presented by Persian Philosopher, [[Mahmoud Khatami]].

==Transcendent Method and Ontetic Reduction==
Transcendent Method was already employed in Persian Illuminative philosophy as suggested by Suhravardi, and developed by Mulla Sadra. However, as reconstructed and presented by Khatami, this method is based  on the notion of ''Tashkik'' (the hierarchic degreement structure) of light as Being/Consciousness/ life. The core of this method is a Tashkiki reduction which is ended and rooted in "Ontetic Reduction." Ontetic reduction is the highest and purest stage within which the tashkiki structure of light, in its three indication, appears. Khatami has reconstructed the “transcendent method” and developed an “ontetic logic”.[1] To set up the transcendent method, first, Khatami starts from every day experience and reconstructs a method to transcend from this experience by reducing it to its original source step- by- step. This method leads to three continuous levels of human consciousness each of which follow its relevant level of logic. Let us describe the pillars of this method and its logic very shortly.

“The transcendent method starts with an ideal for a beginningless commence.”[2] This phrase sounds a Husserlian phenomenological epoche. No doubt, Khatami has considered Husserlian phenomenological method in elaborating his transcendent method; but he has intensively inserted Persian illuminative elements here. First of all, he pursues this beginningless commence in the stage of Tubah (meaning: return) in the illuminative practical doctrine of Sayr va Soluk (literal meaning: journey and conduct) and builds up his integral logic. Khatami’s method and logic is constituted from vertical as well as horizontal aspects of consciousness and being in a hierarchic but continuous structure. According to Khatami, “There are two interrelated kinds of sayr va soluk in general: Afaqi which belongs to the horizon of Being, and Anfusi which is vertically directed toward the purest point (or the source) of Being. These two kinds of sayr va soluk are realised for a Truth-seeker (talib al haqq) in four stages of an existential experience which indicates four ek-stasis of the self to achieve the presential cognition.”

==Ontetic Reduction==
Khatami summaries these stages by using Husserlian term of Reduction again; However, he still employs this word in his specific indication: “Each stage [of four stages] implies a reduction: (a) Reduction from appearances (dawaher) to their essences (mahyyat); (b) Reduction from essences to the knowing self (nafs al 'aref); (c) Reduction from the knowing self to the self as presential cognition (al nafs ‘ayn o ma'refateh); (d) Reduction of the
presential cognition to Being which implies a new return to the things (the phenomenal world) through Being itself, with a different outlook; considering neither their appearance (as phenomenalism says) nor their essence (as phenomenology says); rather, their reality as the
emanative entities.”
Khatami tells us that the reductions (a) and (b) belong to the horizontal lines in the structure of Being, and “we can classify them as the eidtic reduction (in Husserlian sense) because they belong to essences and the eidetic field.” While “the reductions (c) and (d)”, Khatami writes, “belong to the vertical line in the structure of Being and we can classify them as the ontetic reduction.”[3]
According to the above levels and reduction we see three level of logic which are only levels of a continuously vertical-horizontal, hierarchic and integrated logic. The general name he uses for this logic is “ontetic logic” which accords the transcendental method. First level of this logic which happens with application of the beginningless commence, is called empirical logic. Empirical logic is the logic of induction and experiential conclusions. The second level happens with the eidetic reduction, in which we are reflectively seeking the essences and their interrelations as they appear in our reflective constituting consciousness. Eidetic logic covers formal logic in its all presentation, being classic or modern, being deductive or abductive. The third level which is disclosed by the ontetic reduction, in which there is no reflection but a pure presence; it is logic of presence which not formal in its nature. According to Khatami, the empirical logic as well as the formal logic are limited to lower regions of human consciousness and being, and have their special field of application. They are parts of the transcendent method and two primary constituents of the ontetic logic. However, the ontetic logic is Logic of Tashkik, that is, a continuous, qualitative, and hierarchic logic with the ability of descending and ascending in vertical, as well as running and returning in horizontal structure, whether in a linear way or circular etc.[4]
This logic and its transcendent method enables Khatami to start by description of the plain common sense experience which everybody has from him and his environment; then goes further and reduces it to the eidetic entities which constitute various subjects of sciences; then he reduces consciousness to its original source which is presential cognition (and not a transcendental ego as we see in Kantian-Husserlian heritage). It is from this point that Khatami extends his philosophy of subjectivity and other issues concerning human subjectivity.
Meanwhile, by the ontetic reduction he recovered the ancient Persian philosophical triadic idea of “Consciousness-Action-Being” and tried to conclude the ontetic logic hidden in this idea. This idea, though constituted the whole structure of reality, shapes the world of human subjectivity which is a qualitative world (macrocosm) in itself.[5] This means for Khatami that human subjectivity accords the world; the ontetic realm would be a human extroversion, that is, the human triad of presence: “Consciousness-Action-Being”. This approach brings Khatami to centralize “human subjectivity” as the main thematic subject of philosophy: “Philosophy is the only science that purely devoted to human subjectivity and its relationships (which build up his world).”[6] According to this thesis, everything we consider as “a being” means for us as appeared in human world and its network of ontetic relations.

'''Paul Edward Lynde''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɪ|n|d|}}; June 13, 1926{{spaced ndash}}January 11, 1982)&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Lynde, age 3-9/12 years. U.S. Census, 1 April 1930, State of Ohio, County of Knox, enumeration district 9, p. 7A, family 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Edward Lynde, born 13 June 1926, died 11 January 1982. Ancestry.com. ''California Death Index, 1940–1997'' [database on-line]. [[Provo, Utah]], US: The Generations Network, Inc., 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American comedian, [[voice artist]], game show panelist and [[actor]].  A [[character actor]] with a distinctively [[campy]] and snarky persona that often poked fun at his barely [[Coming out|in-the-closet]] homosexuality, Lynde was well known for his roles as [[List of Bewitched characters#Uncle Arthur|Uncle Arthur]] on ''[[Bewitched]]'' and the befuddled father Harry MacAfee in [[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|''Bye Bye Birdie'']]. He was also the regular "center square" panelist on the [[game show]] ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' from 1968 to 1981, and he voiced four [[Hanna-Barbera]] productions: he was Templeton the gluttonous rat in ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]'', Mildew Wolf from ''[[Cattanooga Cats#It's the Wolf!|It's the Wolf]]'' (a segment of ''[[Cattanooga Cats]]''), neighbor Claude Pertwee on ''[[Where's Huddles?]]'' and The Hooded Claw in ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]''.

==Early life==
Paul Lynde was born in [[Mount Vernon, Ohio]], the son of Hoy Coradon and Sylvia Bell (Doup) Lynde. He graduated from [[Mount Vernon High School (Ohio)|Mount Vernon High School]] in 1944, and then studied drama at [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]], where his fellow students included [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Charlotte Rae]], [[Patricia Neal]], [[Jeffrey Hunter]] and [[Claude Akins]]. At Northwestern, he joined the Upsilon chapter of [[Phi Kappa Sigma]] and is listed among the more famous members of the fraternity. He graduated in 1948 and moved to [[New York City]], where he initially worked as a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comic]].&lt;ref name="biog"&gt;{{cite web | author= | title= Paul Lynde Biography (1926–1982) | url=http://www.biography.com/people/paul-lynde-9542425 | publisher=Biography.com | date= | accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Lynde made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in the hit revue ''[[New Faces of 1952]]'' in which he co-starred with fellow newcomers [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Robert Clary]], [[Alice Ghostley]], and [[Carol Lawrence]].&lt;ref name="what-a-c"&gt;{{cite web| author=| title=Paul Lynde| url=http://www.what-a-character.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=LyndeP| publisher=What A Character!| date=| accessdate=2008-01-25| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010082557/https://www.what-a-character.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=LyndeP| archivedate=2007-10-10| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his monologue from that revue, the "Trip of the Month Club," Lynde portrayed a man on crutches recounting his misadventures on the African safari he took with his late wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Vincent Canby | title=A Lost Theatrical Form Returns With a Smile | url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r=1&amp;res=9E01E0DD133DF932A15755C0A96E958260&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | date=21 June 1998 | accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was filmed and released as ''[[New Faces (film)|New Faces]]'' in 1954.
[[File:Uncle arthur bewitched 1968.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Lynde as Uncle Arthur with [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] in the 1968 ''Bewitched'' episode, "The No Harm Charm"]]

After the revue's run, Lynde co-starred in the short-lived 1956 sitcom ''[[Stanley (television series)|Stanley]]'' opposite [[Buddy Hackett]] and [[Carol Burnett]], both of whom were also starting their careers in show business. That year, he guest starred on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Martha Raye Show]]''.

Lynde returned to Broadway in 1960 when he was cast as Harry MacAfee, the father in ''[[Bye Bye Birdie]]''. He also played the role in the [[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|1963 film adaptation]]. That year, he recorded a live album, ''Recently Released'', issued as an [[LP record]]. All six tracks were written by him. Once he could afford writers, he rarely used his own material until his tenure on ''Hollywood Squares'' years later.

Lynde was in great demand in the 1960s. During the 1961-62 television season he was a regular on NBC's ''[[The Perry Como Show]]'' as part of the Kraft Music Hall players with [[Don Adams]], [[Kaye Ballard]] and [[Sandy Stewart (singer)|Sandy Stewart]]. He was a familiar face on many [[sitcom]]s, including ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'', ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]'', ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[The Flying Nun]]'', ''[[Gidget (TV series)|Gidget]]'', ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[F Troop]]'', and [[variety show]]s such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''. He also was featured in a number of 1960s films, including ''[[Send Me No Flowers]]'' and ''[[The Glass Bottom Boat]]'', both starring [[Doris Day]].

Lynde's best known sitcom role was on ''[[Bewitched]]'', where he made his debut appearance in the first-season episode "Driving Is the Only Way to Fly." His role as Samantha Stephens' nervous driving instructor Harold Harold was well received by viewers, as well as series star [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and her husband, director/producer [[William Asher]], with whom Lynde became good friends. Asher then created the recurring role of Endora's practical-joking brother [[List of Bewitched characters#Uncle Arthur|Uncle Arthur]]. Lynde made 10 appearances on ''Bewitched'' as the beloved character, and was regularly seen with Montgomery and Asher off the set as well.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;

Lynde also did extensive [[voice actor|voice work]] on [[animated cartoon]]s, particularly those of [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]]. His most notable roles included The Hooded Claw in ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'', Mildew Wolf from ''[[It's the Wolf]]'' (a segment of ''[[Cattanooga Cats]]''), and Pertwee from ''[[Where's Huddles?]]''. He also voiced gluttonous rat Templeton in the [[animated feature]] ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''. Lynde's sardonic inflections added a dimension to such lines as the sly, drawn-out whine, "What's in it for ''meeee?"'' His distinctive voice remains popular among impressionists. Although it is sometimes assumed that actress [[Alice Ghostley]] based her speech patterns and mannerisms on Lynde's, according to actress [[Kaye Ballard]] "it was Paul who was influenced by Alice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Dennis McLellan | title = 'Bewitched's' Esmeralda Dies at 81 | url = http://www.zap2it.com/news/zap-aliceghostleyobit,0,7769067.story | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] | date = 22 September 2007 | accessdate = 2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hollywood Squares''===
{{tone|section|date=June 2018}}
In 1966, Lynde debuted on the fledgling game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' and quickly became its iconic guest star.  Eventually he assumed a permanent spot as the "center square," a move which ensured that he would be called upon by contestants at least once in almost every round. Despite an urban legend to the contrary, Lynde remained in the center at the producers' discretion.

On ''Hollywood Squares'' Lynde was best able to showcase his comedic talents with short, salty one-liners, spoken in his signature sniggering delivery.&lt;ref name="biog" /&gt; Many gags were thinly veiled allusions to his [[homosexuality]]. Asked, "You're the world's most popular fruit. What are you?" Lynde replied, "Humble."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.life.com/gallery/41132/image/2192797 {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked how many men on a hockey team, Lynde said, "Oh, about half." Asked, "Who's generally better looking, a fairy or a pixie?," he objected, "Looks aren't everything!" and then, after a pause, quipped, "I think I'll take the fairy." Asked whether it was against the law in Texas to call a marine a "sissy," Lynde quipped, "I guess I'll have to take the law into my own hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.PaulLynde.info/audioclips/Other/audioclips.htm |title=Paul Lynde Clips |publisher=Paullynde.info |date=1960-06-05 |accessdate=2013-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017153440/http://paullynde.info/audioclips/Other/audioclips.htm |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other jokes relied on [[double entendre]], an alleged fondness for deviant behaviors, his misogyny, or dealt with touchy subject matter for 1970s television. Examples include:
: '''Q:''' "What unusual thing do you do if you have something called 'the gift of tongues'?"
: '''Lynde:''' "I wouldn't tell the grand jury. Why should I tell you?"

: '''Q:''' "The great writer George Bernard Shaw once wrote, 'It's such a wonderful thing, what a crime to waste it on children.' What is it?"	
: '''Lynde:''' "A whipping."&lt;ref&gt;Zingers from the Hollywood Squares LP, Event Records, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Paul Lynde: Off Center'', A&amp;E Home Video, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''Q:''' "Paul, any good boat enthusiast should know that when a man falls out of your boat and into the water, you should yell 'Man overboard!' Now what should you yell if a woman falls overboard?"
: '''Lynde:''' "Full speed ahead!"&lt;ref&gt;''I Love the 70s: 1971'', VH1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynde garnered considerable fame and wealth from the series, appearing a total of 707 times.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peter Marshall (entertainer)|Peter Marshall]]'' ''[[Kaye Ballard]]'' (''E True Hollywood Story'', 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; He bought [[Errol Flynn]]'s old Hollywood mansion&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt; and spent an enormous amount of money on renovations and decorations.

===''The Paul Lynde Show'' and ''Temperatures Rising''===
In 1972, Lynde starred in a short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom, ''[[The Paul Lynde Show]]'', playing an uptight attorney and father at odds with his liberal-minded son-in-law. The series was a contractual fulfillment to ABC in place of an aborted ninth season of ''Bewitched''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/paul-lynde-9542425#synopsis|title=Paul Lynde|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Lynde starred as Paul Simms, the father of a family that consisted of wife Martha ([[Elizabeth Allen (actress)|Elizabeth Allen]]) and daughters Barbara (Jane Actman) and Sally ([[Pamelyn Ferdin]]). It also starred John Calvin as Barbara's husband, Howie, and [[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]] as Howie's parents. Critics perceived the show as a derivative of ''[[All in the Family]],'' then television's most-popular primetime program, although many admitted the writing was top notch and the sexual connotations gave it an extra bit of spice. Lynde was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor Golden Globe]] for the show. Scheduled opposite the first half of the Top 30 hit ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' on [[CBS]] and the Top 20 hit ''[[Adam-12]]'' on NBC, the series garnered low ratings and was canceled after a single season.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Media reports at the time about ABC programs indicated that research showed viewers liked another ABC show, ''[[Temperatures Rising]]'', but disliked co-star [[James Whitmore]], whereas viewers liked Lynde but not ''The Paul Lynde Show''. Whitmore, unhappy with the show himself, left, and ABC moved Lynde to ''Temperatures Rising'' for the 1973–74 season over the objections of [[William Asher]], producer of both shows, who also quit in protest of ABC's meddling. ''The New Temperatures Rising'', in part because Asher's replacements shifted the show's tone to a much darker one than the previous season, were even lower than the previous season. ABC cancelled the show and its time slot was taken by mid-season replacement ''[[Happy Days]]''. ABC decided to resuscitate the program, with additional cast changes (most notably, [[Alice Ghostley]] replaced Sudie Bond in the role of Lynde's sister, Edwina), and convinced Asher, who admitted Lynde's presence likely saved the series, to come back. Seven further episodes were produced for summer 1974 airings, after which the series was permanently canceled.

In addition to the unsuccessful ''The Paul Lynde Show'' and ''Temperatures Rising'', Lynde starred in four failed television pilots in the 1960s:

* ''Howie'' (1962, CBS)
* ''Two's Company'' (1965, ABC)
* ''Sedgewick Hawk-Styles: Prince of Danger'' (1966, ABC)
* ''Manley and the Mob'' (1967, ABC)

Of the four shows, only the Victorian detective spoof ''Sedgewick Hawk-Styles: Prince of Danger'' was initially picked up by ABC, only to be cancelled at the last minute. William Asher commented in the [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' entry on Lynde that ABC had reservations about Lynde, most notably his increasingly erratic offscreen behavior and the persistent rumors of his homosexuality.&lt;ref name="biog"/&gt;

Lynde was regularly admired by his peers during his lifetime. [[Mel Brooks]] once described Lynde as being capable of getting laughs by reading "a phone book, tornado alert, or seed catalogue."&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; In 1976, Lynde received an Entertainer of the Year Emmy award for being voted the funniest man of the year, which he immediately turned over to host [[Jackie Gleason]] (who never won an Emmy award during his lifetime), citing him as "the funniest man ever." The unexpected gesture shocked Gleason.

===Summer stock theatre===
Lynde was a fixture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ecommons.udayton.edu/archives_morse_media/72/ | title=Paul Lynde Interview | publisher=University of Dayton | work=eCommons | accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Kenley Players]] [[summer stock theatre]] circuit, appearing in ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]'' (1970, 1979), ''[[The Impossible Years]]'' (1969, 1978), ''Mother is Engaged'' (1974), ''My Daughter is Rated X'' (1973), ''[[Plaza Suite]]'' (1971), and ''Stop, Thief, Stop!'' (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kenleyplayershistory.com/productions.htm | title=Kenley Players Productions | accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all he appeared in nine Kenley Players productions, more than any other headliner.&lt;ref name="kenplayhistmost"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kenleyplayershistory.com/most.html | title=Most Appearances by a Headliner | work=Kenley Player History | accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
[[File:The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour Paul Lynde Nancy Walker 1975.jpg|thumb|right|''The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour'' (1975) with [[Nancy Walker]] ]]
Lynde's continuing popularity led to his being signed by ABC to host a series of specials from 1975 to 1979, including:
*''The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour'' (November 6, 1975) with [[Jack Albertson]], [[Nancy Walker]] and the [[The Osmonds|Osmond Brothers]];
*''[[The Paul Lynde Halloween Special]]'' (October 29, 1976) featuring the first prime-time network appearance of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], along with [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] recreating her role as the Wicked Witch of the West from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Hamilton and [[Billie Hayes]] (as ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]'''s Witchiepoo) teamed up in a skit where they ask Lynde to help them improve their (witches) image. Other guests included [[Betty White]], [[Donny Osmond|Donny]] and [[Marie Osmond]], [[Tim Conway]], and [[Roz Kelly]];
*''The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour'' (April 23, 1977) with [[Cloris Leachman]] and [[Tony Randall]];
*''T'was the Night Before Christmas'' (December 7, 1977) with [[Alice Ghostley]], [[Martha Raye]], [[George Gobel]] and [[Foster Brooks]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Joan Hanauer | title = Lynde Tries 'Different Christmas TV Special | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=so5IAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pIMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2769,2833107&amp;dq=paul+lynde+house&amp;hl=en | work = [[The Vindicator|The Youngstown Vindicator]] | date = 7 December 1977 | accessdate = 2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour'' (May 20, 1978) with [[Juliet Prowse]], [[Brenda Vaccaro]] and [[Harry Morgan]];
*''Paul Lynde at the Movies'' (March 24, 1979) with Betty White, [[Vicki Lawrence]], [[Robert Urich]] and [[Gary Coleman]];
*''Paul Lynde Goes M-A-A-A-AD'' (May 20, 1979) with Marie Osmond, [[Charo]] and Vicki Lawrence.

Lynde was a regular guest on the 1976–79 variety show ''[[Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny &amp; Marie]]'' until 1978. He lost his guest-starring role following an alcohol-related arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Paul Lynde Arrested | publisher=''[[The Item|The Daily Item]]''| date = 4 January 1978 |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&amp;dat=19780104&amp;id=nYciAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bqoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4795,1302171 | accessdate = 2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As demand for his services declined, he accepted a wider variety of job offers. He appeared as a guest weatherman for [[WTVG|WSPD-TV]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]], in 1978, to publicize both Hollywood Squares and a summer stock performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Paul Lynde doing the Weather | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX_igvcBICc | accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as Indian chief Nervous Elk alongside former ''Bye Bye Birdie'' co-star [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1979 comedy ''[[The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain]]'' (released as "Cactus Jack" in the UK), which was to be his final film role. Lynde had become disenchanted with being what he called "boxed into" ''Hollywood Squares'' and departed the series that same year. Acting jobs continued to be scarce, although it is unclear if this was due to Lynde's known substance abuse and alcohol problems, which made him difficult to work with.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;

In 1980, ''Hollywood Squares'' was experiencing a downward trend in [[Nielsen ratings]]. Lynde was approached about returning to the program and initially declined, but changed his mind when told he would receive co-star billing with host Peter Marshall. He returned to the series in the spring of 1980 and remained with the show until its cancellation in February 1981.

In November 1980, the Beaux Arts Society, Inc. (founded in 1857) designated Paul Lynde "King" of the Beaux Arts Ball. [[Kitty Carlisle]] was designated "Queen" that year. Paul Lynde remained a Life Member of the Beaux Arts Society from 1980 until his untimely death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beauxartssociety.org/royal-family-.html|title=Royal Family|website=Thomas Robert Stevens|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On January 11, 1982, after Lynde had failed to attend a birthday celebration, his friend actor [[Paul Barresi]] became concerned. When he and another friend, actor Dean Ditman, could not get an answer on the phone or from knocking on his door, Barresi broke into the side entrance to Lynde's home in [[Beverly Hills, California]], and found him dead in his bed. He was 55 years old. Stories suggesting Lynde had a visitor at the time of his death who fled the scene circulated but could not be proven,&lt;ref name="biog"/&gt; as the comedian regularly activated his house alarm before retiring for the evening. When Barresi broke in, the alarm blared, implying Lynde was alone at the time of his death and that he had died in his sleep.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news | author = Paul Simon | title = Paul Lynde Suffers Heart Attack: Dead at 55 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xBJGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KNEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6913,912817&amp;dq=paul+lynde+heart+attack&amp;hl=en| work= [[Glasgow Daily Times|The Daily Times]] | date= 12 January 1982 | accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rush-bio"&gt;{{cite news | author = Rush &amp; Molloy | title = Lynde Bio Squarely Denies He OD'd| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/lynde-bio-squarely-denies-od-article-1.644941 | work = [[New York Daily News]] | date = 1 September 2005 | accessdate = 2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[coroner]] ruled the death a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref name=death/&gt; Lynde's cremated remains are interred at Amity Cemetery, in [[Amity, Knox County, Ohio]], next to those of his brother Johnny and sister Helen.

==Legacy==
Lynde's popularity and high regard from the public have been maintained since his death. A biography was published in 2005, titled ''Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story''. Authors Steve Wilson and Joe Florenski described Lynde as "[[Liberace]] without a piano" and that to most 1970s-era viewers, he was "a frustrated bit player and character actor on a daytime game show". To the homosexual community, his reputation was less than stellar: "In some ways, he came to symbolize what's perceived to be a self-loathing era for gay culture."&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;

Lynde's distinctive vocal delivery has also been widely imitated:
*The character of Wilford Wolf in the animated series ''[[The Kwicky Koala Show]]'' is voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] as an impersonation of Lynde.
*Cartoon creator/voice actor [[Seth MacFarlane]] has acknowledged that the voice of [[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger the Alien]] on ''[[American Dad!]]'' was modeled after Lynde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RycYlI3-7DU|title=American Dad! - Seth on Paul Lynde and Patrick Stewart|first=|last=The Paley Center for Media|date=5 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The voice and humor of ''[[Queer Duck]]'' character Bi-Polar Bear, voiced by [[Billy West]], is performed in the style of Lynde, as is supervillain The Scoutmaster in ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)|Radioactive Man]]".
*[[Steve Carell]] reprised Lynde's role as "Uncle Arthur" in the 2005 film ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', very much in Lynde's style.
*The voice of Big Cheese (voiced by [[Dean Hagopian]] in the show's English dub) on ''[[Samurai Pizza Cats]]'' is a Lynde impression.
*The voice and humor of William A. Mummy on the [[Game Show Network|GSN]] game show ''[[Late Night Liars]]'' is performed in the vein of Lynde as well.
*In the 1970s version of ''[[Match Game]]'', regular panelist [[Richard Dawson]] often spoke in the voice and mannerisms of Lynde.
*Escargoon's English voice in 'Kirby: Right Back At Ya!' is performed by Ted Lewis doing a Lynde impression.
*In 2010, Lynde's likeness appeared in the center square in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Lethal Inspection]]", and again in the episode "[[The Six Million Dollar Mon]]". Both performances were delivered by [[Billy West]].
*Actor/comedian Michael Airington portrays Lynde in the show ''Oh My Goodness It's Paul Lynde'' and ''An Evening with Paul Lynde'', recreating Lynde's 1976 live show, and ''Off Center: The Paul Lynde Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/354355/An-Evening-with-Paul-Lynde/overview | title = An Evening with Paul Lynde | publisher = Movies.nytimes.com | date = | accessdate = 2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airington licenses the rights from the Paul Lynde Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/02/paul-lynde-play.html | title = Paul Lynde play at Exit Theatre gets pulled over copyright claim &amp;#124; Culture Monster &amp;#124; Los Angeles Times | publisher = Latimesblogs.latimes.com | date = 28 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael also sang the theme of ''[[Samurai Pizza Cats]]'' in an impersonated Paul Lynde voice.
*In 2018, drag queen [[BenDeLaCreme]] won the "Snatch Game" episode of [[RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars (season 3)|the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars]] with a portrayal of Lynde.

==Personal life==
Despite his campy and flamboyant television persona, Lynde's private life and sexual orientation were not directly acknowledged or discussed on television or in other media during his lifetime. According to an essay on the web site for [[FYI_(U.S._TV_network)#The_Biography_Channel|The Biography Channel]], in the 1970s, entertainment journalists did not investigate the private lives of performers who were best known as game show regulars.&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/news/tv-stars-of-the-1970s|title=TV Stars Who Ruled the 70s|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, a ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine article on Lynde included text about Stan Finesmith; the latter was described as Lynde's "suite mate" and "chauffeur-bodyguard."  The magazine did not include a photograph of Finesmith.  During Lynde's lifetime, this was as close as the media came to hinting at his homosexuality.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Mike Sacks]] | title = Queer as Folk | url = http://www.salon.com/2005/08/23/lynde/ | work = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] | publisher = Salon Media Group | date = 23 August 2005 | accessdate = 2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathy Rudolph, a friend of Lynde's who published a 2013 book entitled ''Paul Lynde: A Biography – His Life, His Love(s) and His Laughter'', stated in a 2018 interview that "being gay and having to hide it frustrated him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/04/18/bewitched-star-paul-lynde-struggled-with-childhood-insecurities-pal-claims.html|title='Bewitched' star Paul Lynde struggled with childhood insecurities, pal claims|last=Nolasco|first=Stephanie|publisher=Fox News|date=18 April 2018|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Lynde was involved in an accident in which a young actor fell to his death from the window of their hotel room in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Kimpton Sir Francis Drake Hotel|Sir Francis Drake Hotel]]. The two had been drinking for hours before 24-year-old James "Bing" Davidson slipped and fell eight stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yiIhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wGUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3437,3717020|title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynde struggled with [[alcoholism]] and had numerous run-ins with the law and frequent arrests for [[public intoxication]].&lt;ref name="biog"/&gt; Marshall&lt;ref&gt;''Florence Henderson Show'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kaye Ballard]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Marshall, Kaye Ballard; ''E! True Hollywood Story'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that Lynde, when inebriated, would sometimes ridicule his friends.
Lynde was involved in an incident at his alma mater, Northwestern University, in October 1977. He was the Grand Marshal for homecoming. At a fast food restaurant after the homecoming parade, he made racist remarks and gestures to African American NU professor James Pitts. Lynde later blamed his behavior on fatigue and inebriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moseley |first=Ray |date=28 October 1977 |title=Lynde Apologizes for Racial Slurs to NU Prof |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1977/10/28/page/1/article/lynde-apologizes-for-racial-slurs-to-nu-prof |work= Chicago Tribune |access-date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynde suffered from weight-control problems and was honored in 1977 by [[Weight Watchers]]. That year, Lynde's beloved dog, Harry MacAfee, died.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = You Asked Us: About Funny, Fussy Actor Paul Lynde | publisher = ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Montreal Gazette]]'' | date = 17 February 1973 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OoMuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4105,5164883&amp;dq=paul+lynde+errol+flynn+house&amp;hl=en| accessdate = 2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynde could not stay in the house without him and later bought a new home. He spent heavily to redecorate and renovate the house.

On January 4, 1978, Lynde was arrested outside of a tavern in [[Salt Lake City]] at approximately 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. for interfering with a police officer. The officer, who was investigating a car burglary, claimed Lynde kept insisting that the officer "attend to Lynde's complaint that his briefcase with $1,000 in cash and valuables inside had been stolen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Paul Lynde Arrested | publisher=''[[The Item|The Daily Item]]''| date = 4 January 1978 |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&amp;dat=19780104&amp;id=nYciAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bqoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4795,1302171 | accessdate = 2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint was later dropped.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Lynde became sober and drug-free in early 1980.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

'''''Project ARMS''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''ARMS'''''|アームズ|Āmuzu|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Ryoji Minagawa]], with assistance from Kyoichi Nanatsuki. The story follows a young man named Ryo Takatsuki, who at the beginning of the series believes that he was in an accident causing his right arm to be severed from his body. However, as the story progresses, it is revealed that he was actually a test subject for experiments involving genetics and an "ARMS" nanomachine implant, along with three other youths: Kei Karuma, Takeshi Tomoe, and Hayato Shingu. They all meet under strange circumstances and after many battles they set off on a journey to rescue Ryo's girlfriend Katsumi Akagi, who is kidnapped by the Egrigori. The Egrigori are the creators of the ARMS technology. In 1999, the series received the 44th [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for [[shōnen manga|''shōnen'']] category. It was adapted into a 2001 [[anime]] television series by [[TMS Entertainment]].

==Characters==

===Main Characters and their ARMS===
'''Ryo Takatsuki'''
: The main character of the anime. He seems like your regular polite and friendly teenager, but he has extraordinary hidden abilities. Ryo's parents, Iwao and Misa Takatsuki, are former mercenaries who knew he would have to combat Egrigori someday, and quietly trained him in survival techniques, martial arts, and strategy. Ryo always calmly analyzes any new situation and figures out the best solution. Ryo also has a high regard for human life and free will, and always fights for these with everything he has. Cool headed most of the time, Ryo is an excellent leader, strategist, and overall combatant, Ryo nonetheless dislikes killing, but will do so if necessary. Ryo cares a great deal about his childhood friend, Katsumi. As of the epilogue, they are married and have a child who is strongly implied to be the reincarnation of the redeemed Black Alice.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Nobutoshi Kanna]]. In the English dub, he is voiced by [[Kirby Morrow]].

: '''The Jabberwock'''
::The Jabberwock is the most powerful of the four original ARMS, due to its ability to evolve extremely quickly in response to any threat; by the end of the series the Jabberwock has developed an extensive list of combat abilities (listed below). Its AI is extremely violent and unstable; the Jabberwock is the embodiment of Black Alice's hatred - for most of the series its transformed state is simply an engine of destruction, though it eventually submits to Ryo's will. It can feed off Ryo's anger and vice versa, allowing them to synchronize much more easily than Hayato, Takeshi or Kei. Initially it was a powerful hand to hand weapon that could elongate, transform into a shield, and exhibited a limited ability to move on its own to protect Ryo, focused in his right arm. The Jabberwock's nano-machines also give Ryo an innate ability to heal much faster than a normal human even in his untransformed state. The Jabberwock's ultimate form is a hulking red demonic humanoid containing nothing but pure rage and destructive force and is triggered by its host's hatred and anger.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Shūichi Ikeda]]. In the English dub, he is voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]].

::*'''Compressed air cannon'''- This ability was first developed during the fight against the Chapel Twins Al and Jeff. It consumes raw materials like concrete or metal, converts them into crude bullets, and fires them with compressed air at extreme speeds. This ability is highly destructive and was able to severely damage and disable the personal combat cyborgs of the Chapel twins. During a full transformation matter does not have to be consumed to create bullets. The Jabberwock is able to create them internally. This is one of the most commonly used powers by Ryo and establishes him as the only original ARMS with any significant long-range firepower.

::*'''Anti-ARMS nano virus'''- This ability is what makes the Jabberwock especially dangerous to other ARMS units. The claws of the Jabberwock contain a virus which permanently kills the nanomachines of other ARMS in a very localized area around the point of contact. This stops any and all ARMS regeneration in all forms. It can only be transmitted to another ARMS by direct physical contact. The nano-machine virus does not appear to be dependant on the Jabberwock itself to be potent as Iwao Takatsuki comes into possession of a claw that had become broken off from the Jabberwock and the nano-virus was still potent and feared by those it was used against.

::*'''Partial transformation'''- though originally a precursor to Ryo losing control of himself and transforming into the Jabberwock, he has learned to control the activation of this ability. It manifests around his head, with the nanomachines becoming visible across his face, as well as his hair and mouth changing to resemble the Jabberwock's. During particularly tough fights when Ryo needs his strength enhanced beyond its normal limits, his ARMS nano-machines begin to spread throughout his entire body. The nano-machines significantly reinforce his body structure making him more resistant to injury, accelerates his regeneration, and amplifies his strength, speed, and endurance far beyond what they normally are. Ryo has also shown that the partial transformation gives him a significant resistance to toxic materials and poisons. The first use of this ability in combat takes place shortly after the incident at Abumisawa village when Ryo is cornered in an abandoned building by some Egrigori cyborgs and he dispatches them with ease. However, during this time he was extremely mentally unstable so it is unclear if he was willingly using this ability or allowing the Jabberwock to feed on his anger and hatred. The first intentional use of this ability happens during the second battle at Gallows Bell while Ryo is fighting against Stinger.

::*'''Telekinetic immunity'''- developed after the fight with Cliff of the X-Army. During their fight and after sustaining severe damage, the Jabberwock evolved so that it could no longer be directly influenced by Cliff's telekinesis and then showed the ability to tear through the telekinetic shields that he erected to protect himself.

::*'''Limited flight'''- During the fight with Cliff of the X-Army the Jabberwock displays the ability to fly via several small thrusters grown from his back and shoulders, though he is nowhere near as fast or agile as the White Rabbit by any means. He seems to be able to keep himself aloft and charge ahead in a single direction.

::*'''Temperature control'''- After recovering from the nanovirus introduced into his systems by Colonel Gall of the Red Caps the Jabberwock showed the ability to increase the temperature of its body by thousands of degrees. This allowed it to breathe fire, create flaming shockwaves simply by waving its hand, and essentially acted as a shield by vaporizing bullets and other munitions in midair before they could even touch his body.

::*'''Electromagnetic distortion'''- During the fight with Keith Silver the Jabberwock evolved the ability to create electromagnetic fields to distort and deflect the laser blasts fired by Keith Silver in his standard and ultimate forms.

::*'''Anti-matter production'''- The most dangerous ability exhibited by the Jabberwock to date. During the fight with Keith Silver in Gallows Bell the Jabberwock absorbed all the energy from Keith's most powerful laser blast and used it to create anti-matter which he used to create a massive explosion that wiped out most of Gallows Bell, dealt severe damage to Keith Silver, and created a powerful EM pulse that disabled all local electronics including Egrigori's top of the line cyborgs. In issue 11 it was stated by Dr. Samuel Tillinghast that the Jabberwock can create large quantities of anti-matter and this ability could lead to the destruction of the entire world. Though this ability currently takes too much power to use under normal circumstances. This ability is also the only one shown thus far that can severely and permanently damage another ARMS unit without the use of a nanovirus. When the ability was first used in Gallows Bell the antimatter was shot through Keith Silver's shoulder before detonating in the city. The sheer amount of damage done to Silver took him out of commission for an extremely long period of time despite the regenerative properties of his ARMS unit as he was recovering at Area 51. When he finally does reappear it is revealed that the damage to his body was so profound that his arm was permanently stuck in its transformed state and his shoulder appeared to be badly misshapen and had several limiter devices implanted in it. After the giant Jabberwock absorbs a nuclear warhead, it evolves to become a "giant particle accelerator" (according to Violet) and no longer needs to absorb energy to create anti-matter.

::*'''Space-time tear immunity'''- After the first encounter with Keith Green the Jabberwock evolved an immunity to the space-time tears he could create and showed the ability to tear through the space-time shields Green used. (Similar to Cliff)

::*'''Hypersonic Vibrations'''- This ability is acquired by the Jabberwock in issue 16 during the fight against Huey and the Successors. The sonic vibrations emitted by these mechanical men are so powerful that they cause the very atomic structure of the target to shatter and crumble. The Jabberwock at first develops counter vibrations strong enough to neutralize those of Huey and the Successors to allow itself to regenerate, but quickly adapts them into an even more powerful form that not only overpowers the vibrations of the Successors but shatters their vibration resistant bodies. The Knight warns Hayato that this new power is equal in strength to his Lance of Mistilteinn and could make it near impossible to destroy the Jabberwock should he go out of control.

::*'''Hyper Acceleration'''- This ability is gained in issue 16 during another fight against the Successors. What is notable about this power is that it is used by Ryo while the Jabberwock is dormant. Ryo sees an image of Alice that calms his and the Jabberwock's rage and convinces him to believe in his own will and not the power of the Jabberwock. This ability allows Ryo to move at speeds equal to, if not greater than, Egrigori's high speed cyborgs and the Successors. When Hayato fearfully wonders whether the Jabberwock has gained a new power the Knight says that Ryo is the one in control, is bending the Jabberwock to his will, and this power is coming from Ryo himself. Therefore, it could be said that this power is more Ryo's than the Jabberwock's.

::*'''Electromagnetic Rail gun'''- This ability is developed in volume 17 during Ryo's rematch with Keith Silver. Due to his compressed air cannon being ineffective against Silver's energy shield, it evolved to utilize the previously defensive magnetic fields used to deflect Silver's particle beams into a rail gun which uses electromagnetic induction to launch projectiles many times faster and with more destructive force than its previous incarnation.

'''Hayato Shingu'''
: He is an incredibly passionate person. He constantly lives in the moment, and can switch from rage to shock to grief all in an instant. He also has a powerful sense of justice, and will instantly leap in to protect the helpless or punish evildoers. When Hayato was seven he saw Egrigori slaughter everyone in his home village and burn it to the ground. Keith Black killed his parents before his eyes and cut off his left arm, which was later replaced by his ARMS. Hayato then went to live with his grandfather Juzo and learned his Shingu style of martial arts. Haunted by his parents' deaths Hayato only lived for revenge, and he hunted down and destroyed Egrigori agents wherever he found them. After Hayato meets Ryo and his fellow ARMS he gains more self-control, self-awareness, and compassion, which allows him to unlock the 'Heart of Water' technique; a skill that allows him to read his opponents - shortly after, he used it to defeat the superhumanly strong mutant martial artist, Kou Karunagi. Eventually Hayato gives up his revenge and becomes a protector rather than a destroyer, allowing him to access the Knight's ultimate form. Hayato and Kei grow closer over the course of the series, and as of the epilogue, have apparently been in a relationship for some time.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Shin-ichiro Miki]]. In the English dub, he is voiced by [[Brian Drummond]].

:'''The White Knight'''
::Hayato's ARMS is called White Knight (or just Knight), and is concentrated in his left arm. The Knight seems to be the manifestation of White Alice's will to protect. Hayato's arm transforms into multiple fighting blades and a projectile launcher for close combat. The blades produced by the Knight are supposedly the hardest substance that an ARMS can produce, however this seems to be influenced to some degree by the emotional state and skill level of Hayato. The Knight's nano-machines allow Hayato to heal injuries much faster than a normal human even in his untransformed state. White Knight's ultimate form is a powerful armored knight whose lance, the "Lance of Mistilteinn", can destroy other ARMS with an Anti-ARMS Nano-Virus, and as such, it negates the regenerative property of ARMS. The Knight's ultimate form is triggered by its host's desire to protect. During his final fight against Kou Karunagi, the knight develops the ability to allow Hayato to enter into a half-transformed state where the ARMS nano-machines spread throughout his entire body and dramatically increase all of his physical attributes (similar to the half-transformation shown by Ryo Takatsuki). In his fight against Keith Violet the Knight's Lance of Mistilteinn evolved into a vastly more powerful form. It is now a double pointed energy lance that is able to destroy ARMS nano-machines by projecting an intense energy field with every swing and was able to instantly disable Violet's Evil Eye of Balor. White Knight's secret mission is to destroy Jabberwock if it gets completely out of control, and Hayato does not want to be his best friend's executioner.

In the anime adaptation, the White Knight is voiced by [[Jūrōta Kosugi]]. In the English dub, he is voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]].

'''Takeshi Tomoe'''
: He is the most unlikely hero of all the ARMS subjects. Takeshi is smart, skinny, sensitive, solitary, and timid, the classic target for high school bullies. Takeshi was constantly tormented at school, which caused his ARMS to first activate. Takeshi then became even more isolated, genuinely loathing his own body and his cowardice. After Takeshi meets Ryo and his fellow ARMS he finally realizes he is not alone. He also realizes his family and friends are what he really cares about, and that he must fight to protect them. Takeshi then becomes a brave, loyal, and powerful member of the team. In addition to his ARMS, Takeshi's reflexes are incredibly fast. Since sustaining crippling injuries at the hands of Kou Karunagi, Takeshi and the White Rabbit was in a dormant, cocoon-like state and was communicating with Alice while the rest of the team was fighting in Carillon Tower. However, when Ryo and the Jabberwock merged with Black Alice, White Alice offered Takeshi his choice of one of many weapons, all of which would give him more power than any earthly weapon. Takeshi declined the power however, and instead took White Alice with him out of her isolation in Carillon Tower, and using their combined power they were able to attack and merge with the Jabberwock which allows White Alice to directly confront her evil half.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Yūji Ueda]]. In the English dub, he is voiced by [[Brad Swaile]].

: '''The White Rabbit'''
:: Takeshi's ARMS is called White Rabbit, and is concentrated in Takeshi's legs. It appears to be the manifestation of White Alice's innocence. Takeshi can run and jump incredibly fast, perform seemingly impossible midair maneuvers, impressive feats of reflex &amp; body coordination and fly up to several hundred feet. Takeshi is also capable of performing astoundingly fast kickboxing capable of shattering concrete and high speed acrobatic manoeuvers. To put it in perspective, he was able to weave in and out of the spinning blades of two helicopters and move and attack so fast that even the Red Caps, using their telepathic abilities to anticipate his moves, couldn't keep up with him. The White Rabbit's nano-machines allow Takeshi to heal injuries much faster than a normal human. White Rabbit's ultimate form is a winged humanoid that can fly faster than the speed of sound - it is hinted that the White Rabbit's speed is only limited by Takeshi's belief. Though initially exhibiting no obvious weapons, the White Rabbit (and takeshi as well) are well versed in high-speed combat, easily outmatching the most advanced high-speed cyborgs in Egrigoi's arsenel. The speeds that the White Rabbit can reach during a full transformation allow it to put massive amounts of kinetic energy behind any attack it makes, able to reach supersonic speeds almost instantly and offensively utilize the supersonic shockwaves generated to severely damage or destroy opponents. Even the Jabberwock, during an out-of-control transformation caused by Black Alice, was crippled by a direct impact at full speed. In addition to the raw speed accessible to the White Rabbit, after being initially reawakened from his coma The White Rabbit could access near superluminal flight speeds. Appearing as a continuous ray of light while in motion carrying enough mass to blast through Space-Time rips created by Keith White. Again after Awakening from dormancy by a reborn White Alice to fight the Modulated ARMS Troopers, the White Rabbit showed that its already impressive existing abilities were enhanced ''and'' it gained the ability to emit a massive pulse of energy that caused those affected by it to completely disintegrate. The White Rabbit's ultimate form is triggered by its host's selflessness. Like the Knight, White Rabbit is also ready to destroy Jabberwock if he gets completely out of control.

In the anime adaptation, the White Rabbit is voiced by [[Kōji Nakata]]. In the English dub, he is voiced by [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]].

Kuruma Kei
: She is the only girl of the four protagonists. Unlike the others, Kei has known about her ARMS her entire life.
: She was raised by the Bluemen, the organization that combats Egrigori and originally implanted ARMS in the four teens. Kei was raised and trained as an elite soldier. But because many of the Bluemen saw her as a weapon and not a person, Kei grew up extremely lonely, bitter, and even a little vicious. This all changes when Kei meets Ryo and the other ARMS subjects, the only people who truly understand Kei. With them she finally learns true friendship and teamwork. Kei and Hayato grow closer over the course of the series, and as of the epilogue, they have apparently been in a relationship for some time.

In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by [[Minami Takayama]]. In the English dub, she is voiced by [[Nicole Oliver]].

:'''The Queen of Hearts'''
:: Kei's ARMS is called the Queen Of Hearts, and is concentrated in her eyes. Unlike the other three original ARMS, the Queen of Hearts doesn't appear to be affiliated with either White or Black Alice; she is possibly a manifestation of Alice's objectivity (as a scientist), which fits her role as a 'judge' (in her own words, the Queen was born "to be a judge of Alice herself.. to judge... ARMS or mankind"). Kei's ARMS is an array of powerful sensors, including magnification and infrared. Kei can figure out a punch before it is thrown, or a bullet's course before it leaves the barrel, and avoid them. Kei can also activate, enhance, and deactivate the ARMS of her teammates. The Queen of Hearts' nano-machines allow Kei to heal from injuries much faster than a normal human even when not transformed. Kei has nicknamed her nano-machines her "nano-babies". The Queen Of Hearts' final form is a magnificent woman made of light. Similar to the White Rabbit, the Queen's ultimate form is unlocked by a wish; however, unlike the other original ARMS, where the host is asked "Do you want Power?", the Queen asks "Do you want Light?". The Queen of Hearts' powers are the least defined of all ARMS, but she has accomplished the following feats: shutting down the out of control Jabberwock, Rabbit and Knight; a powerful shield called the 'Mirror of Aegis' which can block and reverse any attack (even the giant Jabberwock); and the ability to destroy all the ARMS, including Alice herself, though this will also kill the hosts (It is unknown whether Kei has the mental strength to actually use this ability). In the final battle against the Bandersnatch, the Queen's faceplate is lifted and her identity is revealed as White Alice, though it is likely that this is a result of the events following the activation of program JABBERWOCK.

In the anime adaptation, the Queen of Hearts is voiced by [[Nana Yamaguchi]].

'''Katsumi Akagi'''
: Ryo's neighbor and classmate, and is very kind and compassionate. She is also extremely strong willed, and has no problems telling people when they are being idiots. Katsumi has been Ryo's closest friend since early childhood, and secretly loves him. Unknown to Katsumi herself, she is also an Egrigori experiment with a vital part to play in Egrigori's master plan. Katsumi was, in fact, one of the original ARMS-compatible embryos which is why she and Kei bear such a close resemblance to one another. However, she was not given an ARMS implant for unknown reasons. After Ryo's ARMS activates, Katsumi is always beside Ryo trying to keep him calm and sane. Katsumi is taken prisoner by Egrigori in episode 11, but despite her long imprisonment she is always certain that Ryo will come for her. As of volume 18, she has seemingly been killed by the actions of Keith White and Ryo. White used Keith Green's time space jump to pull her into the path of one of Ryo's attacks. However, she is resurrected in the aftermath of Alice's death. In the epilogue, she and Ryo are married and have a child who appears to be the reincarnation of the redeemed Black Alice.

In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by [[Tomoko Miura]]. In the English dub, she is voiced by [[Venus Terzo]].

:'''The Bandersnatch'''
As Black Alice dies, Katsumi reaches out to her and for a moment, comes into contact. This brief contact leads to the implant of an ARMS core inside Katsumi's body: signs of its growing power are shown on many occasions, in the form of grisly nightmares and increasingly unstable behaviour, culminating in the massacre of a group of thugs, and is subsequently possessed by a resurrected Black Alice. The Bandersnatch's ultimate form is a white version of the Jabberwock: its power is exceptional, as opposed to the Jabberwock's ultimate ability of anti-matter production and flame manipulation, the Bandersnatch's ultimate power is Nitrogen Manipulation; able to freeze a town-sized area to absolute zero and create whiteouts with a mere thought. A more proactive usage of her phenomenal power would be the ability to control and guide the absolute cold, emitting and taking it with her wherever she goes as though the ice and freeze were somehow alive and connected to her. Wherever she goes the icing effect will follow, being at its strongest with her at its epicenter.

===The Keiths===
The Keiths are a series of clones created from the base genetic material of Keith White. The Keith series of clones was endlessly experimented on to create a human being that could survive an ARMS implantation. The first to survive the implantation process was Keith Blue; however the first '''successful''' implantation was Keith Black. Following Keith Black's takeover of Egrigori, nearly all of the Keith clones were destroyed. None of the Keith series' ARMS have an AI.

'''Keith White - Humpty Dumpty'''
: Keith White is the original Keith. His genetic material was used as a base for all of the clones in the Keith series. Keith White was one of the founding members of Egrigori along with Doctor Samuel Tillinghast. Unlike Dr. Tillinghast, Keith White has no sense of morality or respect for human life. His only interest in humans is as research subjects. His philosophy to scientific research gives absolutely no concern to the means as long as the ends is accomplished. He had no compunctions against beating Alice when she asked to let the ARMS test subjects see the outside and only showed concern when she had been shot because he was losing a valuable research subject and key member of his research team. Even towards his own clones he showed little compassion or concern to the ones that died in Egrigori's experiments. He is killed by Keith Black shortly after the successful implantation of Black's ARMS unit. He does not resist or try to run, he simply basks in his own feeling of accomplishment as the fruition of his experiments kills him. In actuality Keith White was laying semi-dormant inside of Keith Black for 20 years and was subtly influencing him and gaining more control as time went on. It should also be noted that Keith White seemed to show slightly more mastery over Humpty Dumpty than Keith Black as he was able to compensate for Ryo's immunities and out strategise him. He also showed the ability to fly through the use of branched, wing-like structures grown from his back. The most strange of all the ARMS, appearance-wise, Humpty Dumpty takes form of a shadowy humanoid creature, though underneath it is a comically stick-like figure. This shadow-like exterior acts as a formidable armor, capable of absorbing and nullifying other ARMS attacks and assimilate them, thus granting control over all other ARMS powers and abilities. Ironically it is mere overconfidence in this pitch-black protective coat that brings disaster upon Keith White, as he doesn't notice the fatal damage sustained against Keith Blue, which in the end shatters his core and renders his barrier useless and allows Violet and Hayato to defeat him. Split in half by the Knight's lance and denied by Azazel, he finally sees the absurdity of his beliefs and dies laughing at himself.

In the anime adaptation, Keith White was voiced by [[Kazuhiko Inoue]].

'''Keith Red - Gryphon'''
: An original ARMS prototype, one of several clones created by Egrigori's original ARMS research scientist. Keith Red is one of Keith Black's lower-ranking officers, but still holds a much higher position than many in Egrigori. Keith Red is the Egrigori's top soldier and assassin, and is extremely skilled, cunning, ruthless, and ambitious. He wants to control Jabberwock so he can achieve ultimate power and escape Egrigori's grasp. Keith Red's ARMS is called Gryphon, and is concentrated in Keith's arms. Gryphon's ultimate form is a powerful feathered humanoid with two enormous fighting blades and a destructive sonic projector, capable to break atomic cohesion with its waves. He fights against Ryo and Hayato once, when he kills Al's brother Jeff, and develops a fierce rivalry with Jabberwock when he is injured by him. However, he met his demise at the hands of Hayato and the Knight, where he lost his arms and he was then cut in half. Before crumbling into pieces, Keith Red reveals that he's not the one who killed Hayato's father, in fact no more than a pawn in comparison with his brothers.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Shō Hayami]]. In the English dub, he is voiced by [[Ward Perry]].

'''Keith Blue - Dormouse'''
: An original ARMS prototype, but his ARMS implant surgery was a failure. As a child, he named himself "Edward", as he despised being called by a number and being surrounded by so many others with the same name. He desperately wanted to success in an ARMS implantation to earn himself a unique color name "Black", but his implant failed. Keith Blue has a delimiter implant that suppresses his ARMS and keeps him alive, but he is confined to a life support wheelchair. Keith Blue escaped Egrigori with the help of Doctor Tillinghast and three Bluemen agents (two of which were most likely Misa and Iwao Takatsuki), taking much of Egrigori's classified ARMS data, the original four core chips, and genetic material. Keith Blue set up his own organization, the Bluemen, to halt Egrigori's plans for world conquest. The Bluemen created the four ARMS teens in their labs. Keith Blue is very reclusive, and is only seen by his top lieutenants. He is a brilliant leader who inspires great loyalty among the Bluemen, and is especially adept at reading human nature. Keith Blue values all people, especially his Bluemen colleagues, but he will not hesitate to put them into danger if that will achieve his goals. His "color name" was given to him by Dr. Samuel Tillinghast, one of the foremost scientists of Egrigori who developed the Keith series, along with researching the lifeform "Azazel" and the ARMS technology. While for most of the series he is bound to his wheelchair and, due to his poor health conditions, he actually never fights, towards the end of the series he sacrifices himself and destroys his delimiter implant, gaining the full power of his ARMS for his one and only battle. His ARMS is named the "Dormouse", and is shown only in its full form, that of a massive, armored humanoid covered in short, thick spikes, which can be shot in any direction and explode violently at the slightest vibration. He dubs these miniature missiles "Tathlums" after magical weapons of Celtic myth. He is the first to challenge Keith White and his mighty Humpty Dumpty, and while unable to defeat him, he proves instrumental for his future death when he self-destruct himself, damaging White's core in the process.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Hiroya Ishimaru]]. In the English dub, he is voiced by [[Ross Douglas]].

'''Keith Violet - March Hare'''
: The only surviving woman of the Keith series, and is beautiful, smart, and amazingly powerful. Keith Violet is very different from her brothers, initially neither a friend nor an enemy of the ARMS teens but an interested observer, though she later sides with the original ARMSs. Keith Violet's ARMS is called March Hare, and appears as a crystalline, reflective humanoid female. It has the power to manipulate and refract light, allowing it to create elaborate and incredibly realistic illusions. It does this by dispersing refractive nanomachines into the air that act similar to fiber optic filaments and can redirect, amplify, and focus light to fire lasers whose paths cannot be predicted. She calls this ability "the Evil Eye of Balor". Keith Violet prefers to be called "Violet", to indicate her gender. Keith Violet was also chosen by Keith Black to be one of his higher-ranking officers in Egrigori.

In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by [[Hōko Kuwashima]]. In the English dub, she is voiced by [[Janyse Jaud]].

'''Keith Silver - Mad Hatter'''
: He makes Hayato look calm and collected. Keith Silver doesn't just enjoy battle, he revels in it. He will gladly destroy anyone and anything so he can get his thrills, even disobeying the other Keiths and Alice. Though in his youth, Silver was named Alex and was known to be a gentle child according to his caretakers and was manipulated by Keith Black to kill them when they rebelled against Egrigori. Keith Silver's ARMS is called Mad Hatter, and emits powerful energy shields or high-temperature particle beams he calls "The Brionic Spear". Its ultimate form is a giant skeletal humanoid. After his defeat at the hands of Ryo at Gallows Bell, Silver was so seriously injured by the Jabberwock's anti-matter cannon that it prevented his left arm from returning to human form. In his rematch with Ryo, the Hatter showed the ability to increase its capabilities after receiving damage in a manner similar to the Jabberwock, but Silver didn't have the mental discipline necessary to control this ability and he was ultimately destroyed by it. Keith Silver was chosen by Keith Black as the second of his higher-ranking Egrigori officers.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Yasuhiko Kawazu]]. In the English dub, he is voiced by [[Lee Tockar]].

'''Keith Green - Cheshire Cat'''
: He is a very deceptive individual. On the outside he seems to be courteous, civilized, maybe even a little wimpy. But in reality he is cunning and powerful, and enjoys slaughter as much as the other Keiths. Keith Green's ARMS is called Cheshire Cat. In its final form, it appears to be a large three tailed tiger, with rows and rows of spikes upon its back as well as jutting backwards on its tail. He can manipulate spacetime, appearing and disappearing at will and causing massive destruction. In Volume 15 of the manga it shows that he does this by sending out rips in spacetime, causing what is caught to be cut. These rips appear to form a physical 'blade' of some sort, since both the White Rabbit and Iwao Takatsuki were able to shatter them (although it wasn't Keith Green using them). In his final form, Keith Green's power remains the same as when he first uses it, although he can create significantly more space-time rips and can reach from him to any point in a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} radius. He calls this technique "Answerer", which is another name for [[Fragarach]], the sword of Irish mythology. He can also use his powers to make almost anything simply vanish. Keith Green develops a crush on Katsumi while she is an Egrigori prisoner, and he is determined to eliminate his romantic rival Ryo. Keith Green was assigned the same rank of authority as Keith Red. Therefore, he is lower on the chain of command than Silver or Violet. James Huang's DNA was used in Keith Green's creation which explains why the two have such similar abilities. Although, according to Huang, they are not as refined or powerful. In volume 18 Green is killed by Keith Black while trying to save Katsumi. While fatally wounded, he uses the last of his strength to teleport Ryo to Katsumi, saying there was only room for Ryo in her heart.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Atsushi Kisaichi]]. In the English adaptation, he is voiced by [[Andrew Francis]].

'''Keith Black - Humpty Dumpty'''
: The calculating big brother and leader of the Keiths. As a child, he and his "true brother" (the soon-to-be Keith Blue), named themselves Zero and Edward. Keith Black was originally a timid child of low self-esteem, who shared a bond with his brother, both stating that none of the many Keiths believed that they were all family. He and his brother were often picked on by the other "batches" of Keiths in Egrigori's labs. Following his brother's leave from Egrigori, Zero (as he named himself) became the first successful ARMS implant of the Keith series, thus earning him the name "Black", which ironically was the name his brother wanted. After killing Keith White, former head of Egrigori, he takes the lead as the second head of Egrigori. He is second only to the mysterious and unseen Alice. Keith has a master plan known only to himself, and he needs Jabberwock's full power to complete it. But is he trying to conquer the world, or destroy it? His powers are the ability to copy the abilities of any ARMS he comes into contact with. He showed that he had copied the abilities of both Keith Violet and Silver and in the process of fatally wounding Keith Green, gained his powers as well. But despite his considerable skills with all his abilities and his general combat prowess, Ryo proved to have the advantage in their fight as he had evolved countermeasures and devised strategies against most of Black's abilities at this point. The only weapon his ARMS has been shown using is a weapon that resembles a mix of a lance and a sword, shown in volume 15 chapter 8 (also, it reveals that he was the one who killed Hayato Shingu's family, not Keith Red like the ARMS teens originally thought). Also, what may be his ultimate form was shown as a silhouette of a hulking humanoid. When Ryo deals a lethal blow to Black he begs Ryo to finish the job but before he can he loses control of his body to Keith White, whose essence as it were, was stored inside of Humpty Dumpty for 20 years after his death.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Ryōtarō Okiayu]]. In the English dub he is voiced by [[Samuel Vincent]].

'''Alice'''
: The greatest power in the Egrigori, progenitor of the ARMS and the unseen director of all the events surrounding the ARMS teens. Born when both Keith White and Samuel Tillinghast were in their mid-thirties, she was a child prodigy, a true genius with phenomenal knowledge (possibly the precursor to the Chapel children). She was the first to understand and then communicate with Azazel (whom then took on the shape of Alice and learned humanity from her), and also cared deeply for the many children that Egrigori used as guinea pigs. Creator of a unique breed of blue roses, named "Blue Wish", while a prodigy she was nonetheless a mere nine-year-old girl, and thus began cracking under the constant pressure of her role as a precious specimen and the monstrous treatments administered to the test subjects by her "fathers". What triggered her anger came after her tenth birthday, when with Azazel's aid she tried to escape with the children, at least to let them see what the outside world was like. This attempt failed, and she witnessed the slaughter of all the children by order of Keith White: it was during this massacre that she was mortally wounded and her full rage and hatred awakened, prompting Azazel to absorb and merge with her, thus creating the core of what would become the supercomputer Alice, Egrigori's most powerful entity, and the four original ARMS cores, each one of them a piece of her thoughts and emotions. What wasn't known until much later was that, when she merged with Azazel, Alice's mind split in two personas, those of "White Alice", that showed her positive feelings, and "Black Alice", a psychotic being driven by despair and pure hatred. While White Alice destroys herself to bring down her destructive alter-ego, Black Alice is unintentionally saved when, crumbling to death, she is briefly touched by Katsumi. Fueled by her hatred for mankind but also by a much more simple need of love, she possesses her and attempts to exterminate humanity in the form of the Bandersnatch, but is defeated by Ryo and his Jabberwock. In the end she regains her sanity, having been shown human warmth for the first time in her life, and is reborn as a fully human girl, the daughter of Ryo and Katsumi.

In the anime adaptation, Alice is voiced by [[Aya Hisakawa]]. In the English dub, she is voiced by [[Tabitha St. Germain]].

===Supporting Characters===
'''Misa Takatsuki'''
: Once the legendary mercenary soldier Laughing Panther. With her partner, Iwao Takatsuki, she was one of the Bluemen's elite soldiers. Then the couple was given their toughest mission of all: to raise the most dangerous ARMS subject as their own son. Misa adapted to her civilian life wonderfully, and even to Ryo she was nothing more than a regular stay-at-home mom. But when danger threatens her son, Misa can still haul out the heavy weaponry and kick butt with the best. Misa has extensive training in all kinds of firearms and hand-to-hand weapons. She is extremely well versed in martial arts, infiltration, and stealth combat. She has honed her skills to such a fine degree that they have become second nature to her and are now instinct. This prevents the Red Caps and other telepathic enemies from anticipating her moves. She can take down large numbers of cyborgs and advanced humans with relative ease.

In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by [[Miyuki Ishijō]]. In the English dub, she is voiced by [[Cathy Weseluck]].

'''Iwao Takatsuki'''
: He is almost never seen in this series, but his effect is felt by every person in the series. Code named Silent Wolf, Iwao is one of the world's finest athletes, soldiers, and undercover agents, and a caring and protective human being. But he shrugs off his talents with a calm, disarming grace, saying he's "Just a traveling businessman" called Wind. Iwao taught everything he knew to his son Ryo, and he also teaches the other characters he encounters including Kei and Hayato. Iwao left his family five years ago on "business", doing field assignments for the Bluemen all around the world. Iwao is just as, if not more, skilled as Misa. He can easily handle several high speed cyborgs and advanced humans with very little (if any) strain, at one point defeating Stinger and Kou Karunagi simultaneously, and also showing the ability to dodge his brother's invisible space/time 'tears'. Iwao has been tracking down his murderous brother Takashi Takatsuki, who has been living under the false name James Huang, for several years after Takashi sold out Abumisawa village (the ancestral home of both the Takatsuki and Shingu families) and out of a sense of familial responsibility Iwao let him escape. He has since been hunting him down to correct his mistake leading up to a climactic showdown between the two in the lower levels of Carillon tower. Takashi was able to make a very narrow escape but only after receiving very severe injuries. Later, Iwao tracks him down during the Bandersnatch incident and, despite Takashi using Green's "Magic Sword of Answerer", defeats him with the Jabberwock's claw.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Kinryū Arimoto]].

'''Juzo Shingu'''
: Hayato's paternal grandfather, the person who raised Hayato after his parents were killed. Though Juzo may look like just an old man, he is the master of the Shingu style martial arts and taught Hayato everything he knows about close combat. His body and mind have been honed so finely that, according to Iwao Takatsuki, in his youth Juzo was more than a match for Kou Karunagi. Juzo deeply cares for his grandson, indeed all children, but he also knows when he needs to be tough and knock some sense into these youngsters.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Masaaki Okabe]].

'''Koichi Kabuto'''
: A police detective from Ryo's hometown. While investigating some bizarre incidents he discovers the ARMS teens and Egrigori. Detective Kabuto decides his oath to protect and serve the public means he must fight Egrigori, and he becomes the ARMS teens' ally. Kabuto is a smart and able detective, and helps our heroes as much as he can. But he also knows he is just human, and when he should just back off and let the ARMS teens do the fighting. Since the attack on Aisora city by the Red Caps he has joined the Bluemen and has continued to watch over the ARMS children.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Daiki Nakamura]]. In the English dub, he is voiced by [[Michael Kopsa]].

'''Al Bowen'''
: A kid, and an unlikely ally of the ARMS teens. Al and his twin brother Jeff were scientific geniuses, and as they grew up people persecuted them for being different. This make the twins hate all "normal" people, and determined to get revenge. Egrigori made the twins their top weapons developers, and with their remote-control cyborgs also a top combat team. When the twins try to capture the ARMS teens they get out of hand, and Egrigori murders Jeff and tries to murder Al for disobeying orders. Al then allies with the ARMS teens to get his revenge on Egrigori. In the beginning Al is extremely self-centered, always talking about how brilliant he is and how the ARMS teens are just heartless morons. But after a great deal of tough love and tender loving care he learns to trust and care about other people. The ARMS become his new family, and he uses all his knowledge and intelligence to help them. Eventually Al gets more physical in the way he handles problems. Hayato is usually annoyed with Al's behavior and whacks him on the head as a result,his also whacks by Kei three time after make she anger (Al later whacks the head of the Chapel Children in the same manner, telling them that he learned it was good for stubborn people). By the end of the series, he seems to have become attached to Yugo, hugging her just before she leaves to fight the Jabberwock. When the group returns to Japan, he moves in with Hayato and his grandfather and learn martial arts from them. He also develops romantic feelings for Carol near the end of the series.

In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Megumi Ogata]]. In the English adaptation, he is voiced by Jillian Michaels.

'''Chun-Yan Lee'''
: The Bluemen's number two leader, and handles the face-to-face matters that the disabled and reclusive Keith Blue cannot. She is a multi-talented wonder, equally at home in a board room, in front of a computer, and on the battlefield. She is brilliant, absolutely calm in tense situations, and with a subtle sense of humor. Like all the Bluemen she suffered terrible losses at the hands of Egrigori, and is therefore unswervingly loyal to Keith Blue and the Bluemen. She is both mother and big sister for Kei, giving her good advice and helping her to follow her heart. She seems to be forming a relationship with Detective Kabuto though whether it will develop into anything remains to be seen.

In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by [[Yumi Takatani]].

==Egrigori Agents==
Egrigori is an immense organization that operates in the shadows and has bases, research facilities, and agents all over the world. Due to its goal of artificially guiding and accelerating human evolution there are countless projects being worked on by Egrigori scientists at any one time. As such it has sent many of its most promising agents and experiments to try and capture or destroy the ARMS teens and their associates. The ones listed below are most likely only a very small portion of Egrigori's arsenal.

===The Crimson Triad===
The Crimson triad is an elite three person special ops team composed of three experimental cyborg siblings. They earned the nickname "Crimson" from the vast quantities of blood they have spilled.

'''Gashure'''
: Gashure is a hulking heavy combat cyborg, leader of the crimson triad, and a veteran warrior who enjoys using overwhelming force on his adversaries. Though he is primarily a cyborg made for close-combat, he can be fitted with a high speed chaingun arm that can do serious damage, even to an ARMS unit. Despite his savagery in combat he believes in a warriors spirit and hates to involve civilians in a battle. He loses to Ryo when hit with the Jabberwock's compressed air cannon. Gashure meets his end when Egrigori comes to Abumisawa to wipe it off the map, he is wounded by helicopter machinegun and missile fire while attempting to defend the civilians and killed after speaking to Ryo one last time.

'''Wasp'''
: Wasp is the only female member of the Crimson Triad. She is an experimental high speed cyborg. She is powered by an experimental oscillating generator which gives her the ability to fly and move at high speeds. She also has an advanced sensor package and a sensor-motor accelerator implanted in her brain that allows her to execute complex maneuvers at supersonic speeds. Her fight with Takeshi was so intense that it caused his ARMS to evolve to its current basic form in order to keep up with her. Wasp meets her end in a very similar manner to Gashure, but speaking to Takeshi.

'''Face'''
: Face is a tall gangly man with a very sadistic attitude and fighting style. He is a cyborg who has had all the joints and bones in his body replaced with an extremely malleable and flexible substance. It allows him to flex his body into strange and unnatural shapes which allows him to easily outmaneuver his opponent in close combat and strike from angles that are nearly impossible to dodge. Because of the malleable nature of his body he has the ability to alter his appearance to look like anyone he wants, hence his codename. He is killed by Hayato after his ARMS evolves. Hayato pins Face to a tree with projectiles from his ARMS to prevent him from moving and then stabs him through the chest.

===The X-Army===
The X-Army are a rogue splinter group of Egrigori soldiers genetically modified or hosting unique biophysical abnormalities within their DNA. Many of their forces were either volunteers or raised from birth for the express purpose of eugenic experimentation through any number pertaining to therapeutic sessions and bodily tampering; such as the replicative pathogen sequencing, augmentative pharmaceutical ingestion or psychoanalytic and mentalist evaluation testing. With the right kind of neural or physiological stimulus, The Egrigori would provoke unparalleled spontaneous changes and alterations in the anatomic structure within the groups personnel. In others they simply awakened long dormant potential for paraspycholgical power  within their subjects. The X-Army took great pride in their unique gifts, but were labeled failures by the same organization directors that created them; driving them to assault the ARMS Team in order to prove their worth as assets by defeating the Jabberwock. In truth, Project X-Army was but a testing bed for the development and progression of other Egrigori Projects, partaking of numerous genetic samples from it's operatives and implementing them in further genetic experiments and research.
       
'''Yugo Gilbert'''
: Also known as the "Angel", Yugo was born with extraordinary telepathic powers. She, her brother Cliff, and several others with extraordinary gifts grew up in an Egrigori lab as test subjects. Yugo and some of her companions escaped from the lab and traveled to Japan. Initially Yugo's group attacked the ARMS teens, wanting to prove their value to Egrigori, but when Egrigori became a common enemy they became allies. Yugo has a secret crush on Ryo Takatsuki, but since she knows he is devoted to Katsumi she never pushes herself on him. Yugo selflessly joins the ARMS in their quest to find Katsumi. Yugo is very different from all the other members of the X-Army because she has a soft side, and willingly helps Ryo defeat Kyklops because she believes Cliff's goal is pointless. Her telepathic abilities are among the most powerful exhibited by any character so far. During the Red Caps' assault on Aisora City she is able to simultaneously control four Red Cap failures whose minds had become completely ruined by the experiments to create them. This proved to be a double edged sword as her control over them was so powerful that she began to feel their pain and eventually mimic any injuries they sustained on her own body. She is unable to read the minds of people who have been trained to resist telepathy, people acting on instinct, or other powerful telepaths. When Ryo is fully taken over by the Jabberwock near the end, she fulfills her promise and attacks the Jabberwock mentally. She frees Ryo and tells him she loves him before dying from the exhaustion of the attack. When the group returns to Japan, they bury her under a gravestone that says "Here lies a girl who called an 'angel'. She remains forever in our hearts" and leave flowers for her.

'''Cliff Gilbert'''
: The leader of the X-army and known as the "Demon King". Instead of developing the telepathic abilities of his sister, the various abuse he suffered at the hands of the scientists in the lab caused him to violently develop extremely powerful psychokinetic abilities. Cliff is able to move and manipulate anything he wants with a mere thought, regardless of its size or mass. The only weak point in Cliff's abilities is that he can only manipulate things that he can see. Under his leadership, Cliff had the X-Army capture three of the four ARMS teens in an effort to lure out and capture Ryo Takatsuki and defeat the Jabberwock to validate his existence and the existence of his comrades in the X-Army. In order to achieve this, he uses the X-Army to force Jabberwock to take control of Ryo, but fails three times. When Ryo defeats each of the X-Army, he challenges Ryo in order to eliminate Carol and lure out Jabberwock, even putting Kei's life and the lives of his comrades at risk to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, when he used Yugos telepathic abilities to make Ryo relive Katsumi's "death" and bring out the Jabberwock he got more than he bargained for. While he initially had the advantage and was nearly able to pull the Jabberwock apart, the Jabberwock evolved a resistance to the influence of his telekinesis and led to him being severely injured before the Jabberwock could be stopped. Following this fight, he and the other members of the X-Army briefly team up with the ARMS teens to share information. Shortly afterward, as the X-Army is about to leave the city, they are confronted by the Red Caps under the command of Gauss Gall and Keith Red. Cliff tells Carol and Yugo to run while he attempts to stop them. Unfortunately, he stands no chance against Keith Red in his fully transformed Gryphon state and ends up having the entire lower half of his body completely destroyed but stays alive long enough to say goodbye to Carol and his sister Yugo.

'''Carol'''
: Also known as "Twister", Carol is the youngest member of the X-Army. She was born with latent and fairly powerful telekinetic abilities. Though her abilities are nowhere near as powerful as Cliffs, they are certainly dangerous. Carol has the ability to use her telekinesis to give anything a powerful and violent twist. This includes any object or portion of a person's body. She can easily break bones, snap necks, and twist or bend steel. She revealed in her battle against Ryo that her abilities come from her psychokinetic strength, much like Cliff but for different uses. During their battle she came close to unleashing Jabberwock, but fails. Ryo then refuses to battle Carol simply because she was a girl, and resists both Jabberwock and Carol, who eventually sees the true meaning of power and happiness, and reconciles with Ryo. As a result, Ryo stops the fight. Carol then gains a genuine concern for Ryo's well-being and advises him not to battle Cliff in fear that Ryo will die. During the Red Caps' invasion of Aisora City she aids Hayato, Juzo, and Al in running from the Red Caps and the rioting citizens. After the invasion Carol leaves her in the care of the Bluemen who find her a family to live with. As a final request, Yugo simply asks Carol to live and live happily. When the group returns to Japan, it is revealed that she is living with Hayato, his grandfather and Al, and learning martial arts. She also appears to develop romantic feelings toward Al by the end of the series.

'''Volf'''
: Volf is a statuesque man covered from head to foot in rippling muscles. He is very vain about his appearance and is slightly effeminate. He also has a slight crush on Hayato Shingu (much to Hayato's disgust). His body has been genetically altered to have qualities similar to cancer cells. The cells in his body are constantly regenerating which makes him nearly impervious to injury. He can regenerate broken bones, cuts, and severed limbs in seconds. However, Volf is vulnerable to direct attacks on his nervous system and bodily functions. This is exploited by Ryo when he specifically targets places on Volf's body that affect his balance, depth perception, equilibrium, and vision. Ryo uses blunt force attacks to Volf's head to disrupt his equilibrium and momentarily stun him. To finish him off, Ryo caught Volf in a head lock and choked him until he passed out. Volf meets his end when the X-army tries to leave Aisora City. When he and Kyclops separate from the rest of the group, they are ambushed by the Red Caps, killed, and strung up from a wall.

'''Kyklops'''
: Kyklops is a mute middle aged man who has been an Egrigori test subject for his entire life. As soon as he was able to, he was handed a blade and taught how to kill. He is a master of close quarters combat, using two experimental vibration knives that were able to cut through Ryo's ARMS like soft cheese. Kyklops has also undergone countless drug treatments and gene alterations to give him incredible optic powers. He can see in a large amount of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays, giving him the capability to see clearly in complete darkness, through solid objects, and across vast distances. In addition, he can modulate light waves and emit it so that he can consume anything he sees in flames. His weakness is an inability to see through mirrors. They reflect and distort light waves and even prevent him from using his heat vision because he risks lighting himself on fire. Extended use of his heat vision puts severe stress on his eyes and further use can cause severe damage to them. It was during their battle that Ryo was first tempted by Jabberwock to unleash him, but fails to do so. Ryo then refuses to battle Kyklops because of fear that he will die. Kyklops meets his end when the X-Army tries to leave Aisora city and when he separates from the rest of the group with Volf, they are ambushed by the Red Caps, killed, and strung up from a wall.

===The Red Caps===
The Red Caps are a small army of supersoldiers created from data obtained from the creation of the X-Army and is under the direct command of General Gauss Gall, an incredibly intelligent and merciless military strategist. Each soldier in the Red Caps is a veteran soldier whose mind has been transplanted into a younger cloned body that has had extensive genetic changes done to it. All of the Red caps have the accelerated healing abilities of Volf, the super-enhanced eyesight of Kyklops, and the telepathic abilities of Yugo Gilbert. While their telepathy is nowhere near as powerful as Yugo's, it allows them to communicate with one another and predict the moves of their opponents. The telepathy has the same weaknesses however, they are unable to read the minds of people acting on instinct, other telepaths, or people who have undergone training to resist telepathy. Also, despite their ability to predict movements and their enhanced eyesight, they were unable to stop Takeshi simply because he can move far too fast for them to keep up. The Red Caps then began sieging Aisora City under the command of Keith Red in order to eliminate both the X-Army and the ARMS teens. Colonel Gauss Gall almost defeated the Jabberwock by shooting Ryo with an experimental ARMS killing nano-virus named "Venom". He then proceeded to use four failed Red Cap soldiers to attack Yugo and Kei. Yugo, however, was able to gain control of them and hold off the other Red caps until the Bluemen arrived and Ryo could reassert control of the Jabberwock and neutralize the virus. All of the Red Caps died at the same time when their artificially engineered bodies began to degrade and age at an exponential rate.

In the manga, the Red Caps appear to be children, in the anime, this is changed to appear as young adults.

===The Hounds===
The Hounds are a specialized unit of non-cyborg combat soldiers. They have undergone extensive gene modifications known as the "boosting" process. The result of this process is that it gives them the physical (and some mental) attributes of the subjects to being similar to primitive man. This gives the hounds extremely acute senses, almost superhuman strength, speed, and stamina, and a strong pack-like mentality which makes it very easy for the leader of the "pack" to coordinate their movements and attacks to catch their opponents off guard. This also gives them a strong sense of loyalty towards their leader and each other. An additional ability that all hound possess is that the longer and harder they fight, the more adrenaline their body produces. This exponentially increases their strength and speed and makes them especially dangerous in prolonged fights. However, this has a side effect of putting severe stress on their bodies and prolonged combat in this state will cause their bodies to overheat and eventually cause the catastrophic failure of all of their bodily functions. Most of the Hounds were stationed at the Gallows Bell facility as the personal bodyguards and enforcement squad of the Chapel children. Their superior tactic and abilities allowed them to catch the ARMS team off guard at first and they managed to capture Al, Yugo, Detective Kabuto, and Takeshi. But on their second encounter Kei, Hayato, and Ryo managed to devise a battle plan to disrupt the group tactics of the Hounds and used diluted rat poison to overwhelm the hounds by using their boosted sense of smell against them. The leader of the Hounds is a man named Stinger. He is the leader of the "pack" and all other members of the hounds default to him for orders unless otherwise told. At the height of an adrenaline induced frenzy he was able to fight evenly with Ryo in his half-transformed state. After his defeat at the hands of the Arms teens he quickly becomes very benevolent towards them. He often refers to the ARMS teens with nicknames referring to the body part they represent with their ARMS unit (Ryo = Right Arm, Hayato = Left Arm). Despite being a savage fighter and very adept tactician, he is a surrogate father figure to one of the Chapel children and cares deeply for them and his fellow hounds.

===Mutants===
Though Egrigori has spent decades shaping and steering the path of human evolution artificially, they also seek out, capture, and study natural genetic aberrations that pop up around the world. These mutations are kept imprisoned in an isolated and heavily fortified prison complex under strict guard so they can be studied. Due to the huge problems the ARMS teens were causing, the top brass at Egrigori recruited several of the most powerful mutants from the complex to go after them in exchange for their freedom.

:'''Kou Karunagi'''- Kou Karunagi (codenamed "Fang") is a hulking muscular man with an obsessive battle lust and seemingly otherworldly speed, strength, and endurance. He was the only survivor of a viral plague that wiped out his village (which might have been caused by Egrigori). His fighting skills combined with his vastly superior physical abilities put him on a level far above most of Egrigori's most advanced combat cyborgs, and was more than a match for the ARMS teens in their first encounter as evidenced by nearly killing Takeshi, physically and mentally brutalizing Hayato, and steadily overpowering Ryo. Even Kei with her ARMS eyes was unable to keep track of his movements. Though formidable, his combat strategy focuses completely around using overwhelming force to defeat his opponent. He is vulnerable to techniques and strategies that are able to redirect his attacks rather than trying to match them. This is exploited by Hayato after he was instructed in the usefulness of these techniques by Iwao Takatsuki and, combined with a partial ARMS transformation, becomes more than a match for Kou Karunagi and defeats him.

:'''Lavinia'''- Lavinia (codenamed "the Witch") is a middle aged woman with a liking for leather biker gear and a sadistic attitude. She is descended from a long line of European witches and comes from a small village which may have been used as a test site where Egrigori introduced radioactive materials into the water supply. She is an incredibly powerful telepath similar to Yugo Gilbert except that her abilities focus mainly around creating horrifying illusions and monstrous creatures that can drive their victim to insanity or even cause actual physical harm if the victim is convinced enough of the illusion. She can also use her abilities to dig through a person's mind to find their worst memories and make the victim relive them over and over again. When she is released with James Huang and Kou Karunagi to attack the ARMS teens she takes a particular interest in Yugo Gilbert because she sees Yugo as competition and she finds Yugo's seemingly innocent appearance as particularly offensive because she knows how much blood is on Yugo's hands and it appears to have left her unscarred. She is consistently outmatched by Yugo (which confounds and angers her to no end) and is finally beaten when she tries to search Yugo's mind and cause apparitions of Cliff, the X-army, and many others to attack her and Yugo causes her mental attack to rebound on her and causes similar apparitions to attack Lavinia and forces her to relive the death of her son at the hands of the people in her home village.

:'''Takashi Takatsuki'''- (aka. James Huang) Takashi is the wayward brother of Iwao Takatsuki and therefore Ryo's uncle. Takashi is a mutant who inherited many advanced genetic abilities from the Takatsuki bloodline. And as such he considers himself to be a superior being in all respects. This attitude caused him to become extremely jealous of Iwao when he was named as the head of the Takatsuki family. This jealousy, combined with his superiority complex and a powerful lust for violence and self gratification lead him to betray the location of Abumisawa village (The ancestral home of both the Shingu AND Takatsuki families) to Egrigori and he fled into the underworld where he underwent many operations to change his appearance and eventually made so many enemies that he actually LET Egrigori put him into the prison complex for protection. After this Iwao vowed to hunt him down and kill him for allowing their entire village to be destroyed and at some point in the past Iwao caught up with him and blinded him. The first ability he exhibits when he is first introduced (and known as James Huang at the time) is an ability known as "remote viewing" a form of clairvoyance which allows him to remotely see anywhere on the globe and find anything or anyone he chooses by channeling in front of a small mirror. He uses this ability to find the Blumen safehouse where the ARMS team is hoping to make a last stand. It is possible this ability manifested as a replacement for his eyes as he does not use this ability again after he regains his sight. Despite being blind, his other senses combined with his superhuman combat prowess make him more than a match for most beings with sight. Later on it is revealed that his DNA was used as a template for the arms of Keith Green, meaning he has similar time-space manipulation abilities. However, Takashi shows much more skill in wielding his powers and can not only teleport or create space-time "blades" but he can create small tears in space-time that cause a concussive blast of force. This ability requires much more fine control than the blades and has a much higher potential for widespread damage. This ability was initially mistaken for a type of telekinesis by doctor Tillinghast. Yet another genetic gift he was bestowed with is the gene for ARMS compatibility. When he was being beaten by Keith Green in his transformed state, he produced a syringe that contained an experimental mass-produced modulated ARMS. When injected, it healed his eyes and restored his original face. In addition to the considerable regenerative ability of the ARMS, his own natural abilities were enhanced several times over and he was easily able to beat Keith Green. His Arms unit has no artificial intelligence and no unique abilities of its own, but acts as an extremely potent amplifier for Takashi's innate abilities. He is later charged with the training and command of Egrigori's new battalion of modulated ARMS enhanced soldiers. He ultimately died at the hands of Iwao during their final battle, when Takashi disabled the limiter on himself to unleash his ARMS full form, at the cost of being unable to return to human form; Iwao cut Takashi down with energy released from one of the Jabberwock's claws.

===Carrilon Tower===
Carrilon Tower is the main base of Egrigori in America and the location of Alice. As such, it has many of the most lethal and advanced projects based there to act as a defense force. Carrilon Tower has many traps and seems capable of changing its layout to confuse intruders. In actuality, Carrilon Tower is the cyborg body of Dr. Dewey Graham; the foremost developer of all of Egrigori's cybernetics technology and creator of the Successors

'''The Successors''' - The Successors are the absolute pinnacle of Egrigori's cybernetics technology. They are so far advanced that they no longer have any organic parts whatsoever, not even a brain. The successors were once humans who had their thought patterns and memories digitized and stored in a state-of-the-art quantum computer system that is constantly being updated. This allows them to be instantly reincarnated into new bodies should the current body they are inhabiting become too damaged to operate or is destroyed. This makes them effectively immortal as long as the main computer remains operational. When they are first encountered in volume 16, the Successors operate as the security force for Carillon tower but they reveal that they have a much greater ultimate purpose: To completely replace humanity as the dominant life form on earth. According to them, humanity has become a blight upon the earth and once Egrigori achieves its goal of eliminating humankind they will take its place. All the Successors are equipped with standard hypersonic vibration generators which break down matter at the molecular level and cause it to shatter and crumble (including ARMS technology), acceleration modules that allow them to move as fast as high speed cyborgs, and are able to instantly coordinate perfectly with each other via a wireless communication link. In Volume 17 Dr. Graham admits that he might have been wrong in his philosophies and what he did to his son. He then initiates Carilon Tower's self-destruct system and erased the quantum computer backup system for the Successors. Effectively destroying their immortality and leaving them with only one life.

Though they are numerous the Successors only exhibited two main personalities
:'''Huey'''- Huey is the chief of security of Carillon tower and the leader of the Successors. He was the son of Doctor Graham who was afflicted with a disease called tyndalos syndrome which caused malignant tumors to gradually consume his body and could not be cured with modern medicine. To save him Dr. Graham transferred his mind and memories into a quantum computer system. Huey is equipped with the same weapons and technology as all the other Successors but after being destroyed repeatedly by each of the separated groups in Carrilon Tower he was re-equipped with an arm mounted laser cannon in addition to his standard equipment. He is killed permanently when Dr. Dewey Graham erases his backup computer after telling him and the remaining Successors to flee the tower and live the rest of their lives however they want. He is caught in an explosion and destroyed shortly afterward.

:'''Clark'''- All of the other Successors are copies of the original Major Clark Noyman. They all look the same, have the same memories and personalities, and have the same basic equipment. The original Clark was the commanding officer of Johann Horst, the leader of the Bluemen affiliated group Drakken Corps before Horst defected to the Bluemen. Oddly enough, while the Clarks are all copies of the same person, the often converse with one another as though they are separate entities.

===Modulated ARMS Troopers===
The Modulated ARMS troops created by Egrigori are the ultimate culmination of their ARMS research. Led and trained by Takashi Takatsuki, each soldier is implanted with a mass-produced modulated ARMS unit. These units have no artificial intelligence like the original ARMS units and are not as powerful as the Original or the Keith series ARMS units, but are nonetheless extremely potent weapons in their own right. When first encountered, the individual appearance and functions implants of the troopers seems to vary widely from person to person. Whether this is due to design or by the influence of the individual trooper it was implanted in is unknown. However, several troopers exhibited near identical combat abilities to the original ARMS units and others showed new abilities. They share several standard abilities with both the Keith's and ARMS teens including extremely quick healing and rapid evolution and adaptation. They also share several weaknesses with the other ARMS units: due to the metallic composition of their bodies, they are highly suceptable to electricity based attacks(though they later evolved an immunity to them), and the power that the ARMS implants gave the troopers led them to become extremely overconfident in their abilities. This allowed them to be manipulated and outmaneuvered accordingly by the more sedate and tactical minded ARMS teens. Additionally, since the ARMS teens had lived with their ARMS for so long, they knew how to exploit weaknesses in the Trooper's tactics and their ARMS units themselves despite having their own ARMS units in an unusable dormant state at the time. In addition to the basic abilities given by their ARMS units, the troopers all have ultimate forms though they appear unable to transform between their human and ultimate forms at will. Each trooper is equipped with a limiter implant that partially suppresses their ARMS unit enough to keep them in human form but allows them to use their basic forms. The release of these limiters was placed under the control of their leader Takashi Takatsuki via a remote trigger device. When released, each trooper rapidly and violently evolves to their ultimate forms which has a completely unique appearance for each trooper; again, whether this is due to design or the influence of the trooper's personality is unknown. When transformed, they are more than a match for Kou Karunagi and Ryo, Takeshi, and Hayato with their dormant ARMS. However, when the original ARMS units awaken the troopers are obscenely outmatched by their much more powerful and battle hardened predecessors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1436">'''Psychic assault''' is a term used by academic legal writers as a synonym for [[assault]] (or [[common assault]]) in order to distinguish that offence from the related crime of [[battery (crime)|battery]] and so avoid confusion. The need for this term arises from the fact that the word assault is frequently used to refer collectively both to that offence and to battery.

The word 'psychic' is used to denote the fact that the [[actus reus]] of the offence that is correctly described as assault consists of affecting the mind of the other person (whereas battery consists of the application of force).

The '''SS ''City of Everett''''' was an important [[whaleback]] steamship. She sailed from 1894 until 1923, and was the first U.S. steamship to pass through the [[Suez Canal]], as well as the first to circumnavigate the globe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4442/is_200410/ai_n16065472/pg_2 | work=Sea Classics | title=LAST of the WHALEBACKS | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her radio call letters were GF and her signal letters KMCQ.

==Origin==
In the 1890s, [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], the originator of the whaleback ship design, wanted to build ships in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], on the Pacific Coast. His steamer {{SS |Charles W. Wetmore}} (1891 – 265&amp;nbsp;ft) became the first lake vessel to leave the [[Great Lakes]] when she took a load of grain from Duluth to Liverpool, England, shooting the St. Lawrence rapids in the process. ''Wetmore'' was sent around [[Cape Horn]] with a load of supplies for the establishment of a shipbuilding colony near [[Everett, Washington]]. From parts she carried, the ''City of Everett'' was built, commissioned in 1894. Intended to be the first of a line of whaleback ships built out of the facility in Everett, changing fortunes resulted in her being the only ship produced there by McDougall's ill-fated company.

==Her career==
The unarmed steamer “captured” the City of [[Malaga, Spain]], when it entered the harbor seeking fresh water, which occasioned a surrender by the city’s inhabitants during the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name="Zoss"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zP75S5HJA8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq  |isbn=9781439635056|title=McDougall’s Great Lakes Whalebacks |first1=Neel R. |last1=Zoss |date=August 15, 2007 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:City of Everett.jpg|thumb|left|The ''City of Everett'' underway]]

On 8 September 1902, ''City of Everett'' suffered an explosion while loading at [[Port Arthur, Texas]]. Her captain, a mate, and several crew members were seriously injured; the resulting fire engulfed not only the ship, but also destroyed the docks and wharves of the Texas Company (later known as [[Texaco]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles11/port-arthur-7.shtml|title=Bulls And Bears|website=www.oldandsold.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1905, ''City of Everett'' collided with the Norwegian steam freighter ''Leif Eriksson'' north of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. ''Leif Eriksson'' took on water through a deep gash in her hull, and sank in less than 10 minutes with the loss of two lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=25 September 2007: Identification of the "Anchor Wreck" |publisher=Association of Underwater Explorers |author=Barnette, Michael C. |url=http://uwex.us/AUEaugust07.htm |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-09-06 |authorlink=Michael C. Barnette }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near [[Nantucket]] on 23 January 1909, ''City of Everett'' heard a [[CQD|distress signal]] from the [[RMS Republic|RMS ''Republic'']], which was taking on water following a collision. Captain Thomas Fenlon of the ''City of Everett'' twice offered his ship's considerable pumping and towing abilities, but with assistance reportedly on the way from the [[White Star Line]], ''Republic'' declined.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/01/27/101864346.pdf ''New York Times article'', 26 January 1909 ''Could Have Saved Republic, He Says"&lt;/ref&gt; Fog delayed tugs of the White Star Line, and towing efforts by the smaller US Coast Guard cutter [[USCGC Gresham (WPG-85)|''Gresham'']] failed. ''Republic'' sank the next day. Newspapers at the time reported that if the White Star Line had been successful in recovering the ''Republic'' with company ships, instead of using a third-party salvor, it could have recouped some of its salvage expenses from the owners of the recovered cargo aboard the ''Republic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rms-republic.com/sal01.html|title=Practically Unsinkable - RMS - Republic|website=www.rms-republic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inference was that ''Republic's'' captain had refused aid merely to prevent another company from sharing the salvage award if the ship were to be saved. ''Everett's'' Captain Fenlon maintained that, as ''Republic'' had remained afloat until the day after the collision, she could have been saved if she had accepted a tow from ''City of Everett'', stating that his boat was "built for ocean towing" and was equipped with "tremendously powerful machinery and towing cables seven inches (178 mm) in diameter", as well as pumps with a capacity of "two million gallons an hour".&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

While carrying [[molasses]] from [[Santiago, Cuba]] to [[New Orleans]] on 11 October 1923, ''City of Everett'' [[shipwreck|foundered]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. All 26 people on board died in the sinking.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visseraa.piranho.de/International/id614.htm|title=piranho|website=visseraa.piranho.de}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of the shipwreck ''City of Everett''==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3950">[[File:Hydras (8).JPG|thumb|upright|Generally sessile ''Hydra'' attached to a substrate]]
In [[biology]], '''sessility''' (in the sense of positional movement or ''[[motility]]'') refers to [[organisms]] that do not possess a means of self-locomotion and are normally immobile. This is distinct from the [[sessility (botany)|second meaning of sessility]] which refers to an organism or biological structure attached directly by its base without a stalk.

Sessile organisms can move through outside sources (such as water currents) but are usually permanently attached to something. Organisms such as [[coral]]s lay down their own [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] from which they grow.  Other organisms grow from a solid such as a rock, dead tree trunk, or a manmade object such as a buoy or ship's hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Biology of the Invertebrates|last=Pechenik|first=Jan|date=2016|ISBN=9781497006515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobility==
Sessile animals typically have a motile phase in their development. [[Sponge]]s have a motile [[larval]] stage, which becomes sessile at maturity. In contrast, many [[jellyfish]] develop as sessile [[polyp]]s early in their life cycle. In the case of the [[cochineal]], it is in the nymph stage (also called the crawler stage) that the cochineal disperses. The juveniles move to a feeding spot and produce long wax filaments. Later they move to the edge of the cactus pad where the wind catches the wax filaments and carries the tiny larval cochineals to a new host.

==Reproduction==
Many sessile animals, including sponges, [[coral]]s and [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], are capable of [[asexual reproduction]] ''[[in situ]]'' by the process of [[budding]].  Sessile organisms such as [[barnacle]]s and [[tunicate]]s need some mechanism to move their young into new territory. This is why the most widely accepted theory explaining the [[evolution]] of a [[larva]]l stage is the need for long-distance dispersal ability. [[Wayne Sousa]]'s 1979 study in intertidal disturbance added support for the theory of nonequilibrium community structure, “suggesting that open space is necessary for the maintenance of diversity in most communities of sessile organisms.”&lt;ref&gt;WP. Ecology. 1979. Disturbance in Marine Intertidal Boulder Fields: The Nonequilibrium maintenance of species diversity. http://bio.classes.ucsc.edu/bio170/Readings/sousa%201979.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clumping==
{{Main Article|Clumping (biology)}}

'''Clumping''' is a behavior in sessile organisms, in which individuals of a particular species group closely to one another for beneficial purposes, and can be seen in [[coral reef]]s and cochineal populations. This allows for faster reproduction and better protection from predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates|author=James H.

==Predominance in coastal environments==
The circa [[littoral zone]] of [[coast]]al environments and [[biome]]s are dominated by sessile organisms such as [[oyster]]s. [[Carbonate platform]]s grow due to the buildup of skeletal remains of sessile organisms, usually [[microorganism]]s, which induce carbonate precipitation through their metabolism.

==Distinction from anatomical and botanical sessility==
In anatomy and botany, ''sessility'' refers to an organism or biological structure that has no ''peduncle'' or stalk. See [[Peduncle (anatomy)]], [[Peduncle (botany)]] and [[Sessility (botany)]]. A sessile structure has no stalk.

'''Suspension''' is either paid or unpaid  time away from the workplace as ordered by the employer in order for a workplace investigation to take place.

== Workplace ==
Suspension is a common practice in the [[Employment|workplace]] for being in violation of an organization's [[policy]], or major breaches of policy. Work suspensions occur when a business manager or supervisor deems an action of an employee, whether intentional or unintentional, to be a violation of policy that should result in a course of punishment, and when the employee's absence during the suspension period does not affect the company. This form of action hurts the employee because s/he will have no hours of work during the suspended period and therefore will not get paid, unless the suspension is with pay, or is challenged and subsequently overturned. Some jobs, which pay on [[salary]], may have paid suspensions, in which the affected worker will be prevented from coming to work but will still receive pay. Generally, suspensions are deemed most effective if the affected worker remains unpaid. Suspensions are usually given after other means of [[counseling statements]] have been exhausted, but some violations may result in immediate suspension. Suspensions are tracked, and any number of them, even one may prevent one from receiving raises, bonuses or promotions, or could cause [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissal]] from the company.

Suspension clauses are common components of [[collective bargaining]] [[Contract|agreements]]. Suspensions may be challenged by employees in [[Trade union|unionized]] organizations through the filing of a [[grievance (labour)|grievance]].

Suspension on full pay can also be used when an employee needs to be removed from the workplace to avoid prejudicing an investigation. This is used not as a punishment, but in the employer's best interest. For example, a [[police officer]] who shoots a person while on duty will be given a suspension with pay during the investigation, not to punish, but to enable the department to carry out its investigation.

== Sport ==
Suspension is a punishment in [[sport]] where players are banned from playing a certain number of future games. These suspensions may be issued for severe infractions of the rules of play (such as [[personal foul (disambiguation)|personal foul]]s), excessive technical, or flagrant fouls for the duration of a season, fights during the course of the game in which the player was a part of the wrongdoing, or misconduct off the field (such as illegal or banned substance use).

Generally, an athlete who is suspended must forfeit his pay during the course of the suspension, and depending on the team's or league's rules, may not be permitted to don his uniform or be present with the team during the course of play, which often includes attending games in the stands as a typical spectator would.

== Academia ==&lt;!-- [[In-school suspension]] redirects to here --&gt;
{{See also|School discipline}}
In academia, suspension (also known as temporary exclusion) is a mandatory leave assigned to a [[student]] as a form of [[punishment]] that can last anywhere from one [[day]] to several [[week]]s, during which time the student is not allowed to attend regular [[school]] lessons.  

===ISS/In-School Suspension===
In-School Suspension (ISS) or On-Campus suspension (OCS), sometimes known as "internal exclusion/isolation", and by some [[Florida]] schools as "School Center for Special Instruction",&lt;ref name="stateimpact.npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzalez|first= Sarah|url=http://stateimpact.npr.org/florida/2012/05/04/floridas-in-school-suspension-policy-keeps-students-out-of-class/|title=In-School Suspension: a Better Alternative or Waste of Time?|publisher=stateimpact.npr.org|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative setting that removes students from the classroom for a period of time, while requiring students to attend school and complete their work. This form of punishment is often chosen because it provides supervision and structure to the students' days, whereas a student who is given an off-campus suspension receives essentially an unscheduled holiday, as off-campus suspension is widely considered to be nothing more than a pleasant reward to most students, instead of the punishment that it is intended to be, and also gives students more of a reason to misbehave on purpose, to those who would prefer to be suspended out of school, rather than being kept in school. Generally, a student assigned to on-campus suspension spends the entire school day in the designated OCS location, completes work submitted in advance by the student's teachers, and is monitored by school staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandi.net/depts/placement_appeal/discipline_policy/suspension.html Suspension Policy :: San Diego Unified School District] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503113425/http://www.sandi.net/depts/placement_appeal/discipline_policy/suspension.html |date=2008-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One variation of in-school suspension requires the student to arrive at school at a designated time on a Saturday to serve out their punishment, rather than miss class time during the week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murray.spps.org/iss.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301144623/http://www.murray.spps.org/iss.html |date=March 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of punishment is commonly referred to as "Saturday School" or more commonly, "Saturday Detention", but it may go under other names as well. The name "Saturday School" is also used to indicate [[School punishment#Detention|detention]], a less serious punishment. If a student fails to show up at Saturday School, it might result in a more serious punishment being given to the student.

===OSS/Out of School Suspension===
The student's parents or guardians are usually notified as to the reason for and the duration of the suspension. Sometimes students have to complete work during their suspensions for which they will receive no credit (OSS). Also, upon returning to school, it is often mandatory that the student, his/her parents/guardians, and a school administrator have a meeting to discuss and evaluate the matter.  If the suspension is related to the symptoms of a disability or the student is receiving special education or mental health services, students may be required to consult their case manager, counselor, or school psychologist before and/or after the suspension. In some schools, this meeting is prior to the suspension.&lt;ref&gt;[[Delran High School]] Student-Parent Handbook 2008–2009, page 10 section C #1.&lt;/ref&gt; Applications to some colleges ask the student whether or not they have ever been suspended. In some places in the [[United States]], a suspension is noted on one's [[transcript (education)|transcript]]. However, other places do not report suspensions or are expressly forbidden from doing so under state law. Students who breach a suspension (attend the school while suspended) may be arrested for, and charged with [[trespassing]]. This could result in an extension of suspension, community service, and sometimes jail time. Students who continue to breach a suspension could be sentenced to [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] and longer, more severe punishments. Students are also not allowed to attend after school activities (such as proms, sporting events, etc.) while suspended from school.

== Roman Catholic canon law ==
In Roman Catholic canon law, the censure of suspension prohibits certain acts by a cleric, whether the acts are of a religious character deriving from his [[Holy Orders|ordination]] ("acts of the power of orders") or are exercises of his power of governance or of rights and functions attached to the office he holds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4X.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1333]&lt;/ref&gt;

This censure is automatically applied to a cleric who uses physical violence against a bishop,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P53.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1370]&lt;/ref&gt; a deacon who attempts to celebrate the sacrifice of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or a priest who, though not empowered to grant sacramental absolution attempts to do so or who hears sacramental confession,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1378]&lt;/ref&gt; a cleric who celebrates a sacrament through [[simony]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1380]&lt;/ref&gt; and on a person who receives ordination illicitly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1383]&lt;/ref&gt;

The censure of suspension (along with other punishments) is to be inflicted also on a cleric who openly lives in violation of chastity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P56.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1395]&lt;/ref&gt; and on any priest who "in the act, on the occasion, or under the pretext of confession" solicits a penitent to a sexual sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1387]&lt;/ref&gt; Suspension is incurred automatically by any cleric who falsely denounces a priest of having committed this delict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P55.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1390]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Varmint of Burke's Garden''' was the name given to a [[coyote]] that terrorized the community of [[Burke's Garden, Virginia]], in 1952. The animal killed over 400 registered [[sheep]] and caused damages in excess of $32,000 before being killed.

To aid in the creature's capture, the [[county board of supervisors|board of supervisors]] of [[Tazewell County, Virginia|Tazewell County]] contacted [[Clell Lee|Clell]] and [[Dale Lee (hunter)|Dale Lee]], two of the best-known [[big-game hunter]]s then active in the [[United States]]; their [[Hound Group|dog]]s were well known for being able to track most kinds of animals. The men were residents of [[Arizona]], but were requested to come to [[Virginia]] to help local residents.  Dale Lee was in [[Venezuela]] hunting [[jaguar]]s, but his brother Clell was available and answered the call. He arrived in [[Bluefield, Virginia|Bluefield]] to find himself coolly received by local farmers; however, Mrs. Meeks, the wife of one of the men, was kinder, and invited him to stay at her home.

Lee identified the animal by a track that had been left in a block of ice. His diagnosis shocked many, as no coyotes had been seen in the area in memory. Accompanied by the [[sheriff]], as well as by local farmers, hunters, and [[game warden]]s, Lee and his dogs soon found the scent, following it for around five hours before nightfall.

Lee ordered all parties back to the hunt at dawn the next morning. The sheriff objected, saying that nobody in the county hunted on Sundays; Lee, however, explained that he had found a fresh scent, and saw no reason to impose upon locals any longer than necessary. Learning that the animal had struck again that night, killing two sheep, Lee stationed hunters near the site of the attack and set his dogs back on the scent. A Burke's Garden resident, Alfred Jones, killed the coyote after a chase of a few hours.  Alfred was accompanied by Dewey Tibbs and Hugh Cox.  The Varmint was killed in the Joe Moss Cemetery.

The creature was found to be quite large - it was nearly four-and-a-half feet long and weighed 35 pounds, and its fangs were an inch long.

Local residents were jubilant, and a dinner was held in Lee's honor. The coyote was strung up and hung from a tree near the [[courthouse]], and nearly 7,500 people came through to see both the hunter and the dead animal. The animal was stuffed and is currently on display at the [[Crab Orchard Museum]] in [[Tazewell, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="BTD" /&gt;

==Marathon==
In 1993, Burke's Garden began hosting the [http://www.runtricities.net/asp/racecal_manage.asp?action=view&amp;racecalid=188 Varmint] [[Half Marathon]] and [[5000 metres|5K]] race, held annually in June. Winners receive trophies in the shape of sheep to commemorate the destruction caused by the Varmint.&lt;ref name="BTD"&gt;[http://www.bdtonline.com/localsports/local_story_158231930.html?keyword=topstory Varmint: Road race returns for 14th year].

'''Vukašin Šoškoćanin''' ({{lang-sr|Вукашин Шошкоћанин}}; 24 June 1958 – 15 May 1991) was a [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serb]] war commander. He was president of the [[Borovo, Croatia|Borovo commune]] and commander of the [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Borovo Selo Territorial Defense Force]] during the [[Croatian War of Independence|Croatian War]]. Born to Milan and Ljubica Šoškoćanin on 24 June 1958, Vukašin had two brothers, Radovan and Dušan. He became a member of the [[Serb Democratic Party (Croatia)|Serb Democratic Party]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mup.hr/main.aspx?id=10351 Profile], mup.hr; accessed 8 April 2015.{{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the war, he was a [[Paraveterinary workers|veterinary technician]] in [[Vukovar]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Circumstances surrounding his death are largely unknown. On 15 May 1991 at around 10:30 AM, while returning from a visit to a refugee camp in [[Vojvodina]], he drowned in the [[Danube|Danube river]] in a "boating accident."&lt;ref name="Deep Emotion Beneath Belgrade's Calm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1991-05-26/news/25799026_1_serbs-croatia-civil-war|author=Dan Stets, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''|title=Deep Emotion Beneath Belgrade's Calm|accessdate=20 August 2014|date=26 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Milan Paroški]] publicly questioned the official cause of death and claimed that [[Frogman|frogmen]] (either the [[Yugoslav Navy|Yugoslav River Flotilla]] or the [[State Security Service (Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)|Serbian State Security]]) were responsible for Šoškoćanin's death.&lt;ref name="pogledi"/&gt; Paroški also claimed that Šoškoćanin was "an excellent swimmer."&lt;ref name="pogledi"&gt;''[[Pogledi]]'', issue number 138, pp. 16-17, 9 March 1993; YU {{ISSN|0353-3832}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death is still labeled under "mysterious circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.b92.net/specijal/vukovar-eng/press13.php&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, an elementary school in Borovo was named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udbina.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1199:godinjica-otpora-u-borovom-selu-borovo-selo-2-maja&amp;catid=108:domovinski-rat&amp;Itemid=135 School in Borovo named after Šoškoćanin], udbina.com; accessed 8 April 2015. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104075840/http://www.udbina.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1199%3Agodinjica-otpora-u-borovom-selu-borovo-selo-2-maja&amp;catid=108%3Adomovinski-rat&amp;Itemid=135 |date=4 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posthumously awarded the title of "Hero of the People" in [[Beli Manastir]] on 25 September 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.vecernji.hr/sandra-sabljak/2011/04/23/sramota-spomenici-koji-velicaju-krvnika-a-omalovazavaju-zrtvu Profile], blog.vecernji.hr; accessed 8 April 2015.{{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current impact hypothesis states that the air burst(s) or impact(s) of a swarm of [[Chondrite#Carbonaceous chondrites|carbonaceous chondrites]] or [[comet]] fragments set areas of the [[North American]] continent on fire, causing the [[Quaternary extinction event|extinction of most of the megafauna]] in [[North America]] and the demise of the North American [[Clovis culture]] after the [[last glacial period]].&lt;ref name= "Kennett"/&gt; The Younger Dryas ice age lasted for about 1,200 years before the climate warmed again. This swarm is hypothesized to have exploded above or possibly on the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] in the region of the [[Great Lakes]], though no impact crater has yet been identified and no physical model by which such a swarm could form or explode in the air has been proposed. Nevertheless, the proponents suggest that it would be physically possible for such an air burst to have been similar to, but orders of magnitude larger than, the [[Tunguska event]] of 1908. The hypothesis proposed that animal and human life in North America not directly killed by the blast or the resulting coast-to-coast [[wildfire]]s would have likely starved on the burned surface of the continent.

== Evidence ==
The evidence given by proponents of an impact event includes "black mats" of organic-rich soil that have been found at some 50 Clovis sites across the continent. Proponents have reported materials ([[nanodiamonds]], metallic microspherules, carbon spherules, magnetic [[Spherulite|spherule]]s, [[iridium]], [[platinum]], charcoal, soot, and [[fullerene]]s enriched in [[helium-3]]), which they interpret to be potential evidence of an impact event, at the very bottom of black mats of organic material that marks the beginning of the Younger Dryas,&lt;ref name="Dalton"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/447256a |pmid=17507957 |title=Blast in the past? |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7142 |pages=256–257 |year=2007 |last1=Dalton |first1=Rex }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wittke b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wittke JH, Weaver JC, Bunch TE, Kennett JP, Kennett DJ, Moore AM, Hillman GC, Tankersley KB, Goodyear AC, Moore CR, Daniel IR, Ray JH, Lopinot NH, Ferraro D, Israde-Alcántara I, Bischoff JL, DeCarli PS, Hermes RE, Kloosterman JB, Revay Z, Howard GA, Kimbel DR, Kletetschka G, Nabelek L, Lipo CP, Sakai S, West A, Firestone RB | title = Evidence for deposition of 10 million tonnes of impact spherules across four continents 12,800 y ago | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 23 | pages = E2088–97 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23690611 | pmc = 3677428 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1301760110 | bibcode = 2013PNAS..110E2088W }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is claimed these cannot be explained by volcanic, anthropogenic, or other natural processes.&lt;ref name=Bunch/&gt;

Research has been reported that at [[Lake Cuitzeo]], in the central Mexican state of [[Guanajuato]], evidence supporting a modified version of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis—involving a much smaller, non-cometary impactor—was found in lake bed cores dating to 12,900&amp;nbsp;BP. The reported evidence included nanodiamonds (including the hexagonal form called [[lonsdaleite]]), carbon spherules, and magnetic spherules. Multiple hypotheses were examined to account for these observations, though none were believed to be terrestrial. Lonsdaleite occurs naturally in asteroids and cosmic dust and as a result of extraterrestrial impacts on Earth. The analysis of the study has not been confirmed or repeated by other researchers.&lt;ref name="ISRADE-ALCÁNTARA2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Israde-Alcántara I, Bischoff JL, Domínguez-Vázquez G, Li HC, DeCarli PS, Bunch TE, Wittke JH, Weaver JC, Firestone RB, West A, Kennett JP, Mercer C, Xie S, Richman EK, Kinzie CR, Wolbach WS | title = Evidence from central Mexico supporting the Younger Dryas extraterrestrial impact hypothesis | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 13 | pages = E738–47 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22392980 | pmc = 3324006 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1110614109 | bibcode = 2012PNAS..109E.738I }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lonsdaleite has also been made artificially in laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1841236|title=Hexagonal Diamond—A New Form of Carbon|year=1967|author=Bundy, F.

Another study, related to this hypothesis, by Antonio Zamora&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.01.019 |title=A model for the geomorphology of the Carolina Bays |journal=Geomorphology |volume=282 |pages=209–216 |year=2017 |last1=Zamora |first1=Antonio }}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a model of the formation of the Carolina Bays as an indirect consequence of an impact of a comet-like body on the Laurentide Ice Sheet that ejected ice boulders in ballistic trajectories that created the Bays all heading to the Great Lakes Region. It also provides an explanation about the formation of Nebraska's rainwater basins and why they are all pointing to the Lakes Region too. However, this study does not apply the widely accepted standards for identifying and confirming terrestrial impact structures. &lt;ref name="FrenchKoeberl2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=French|first1=Bevan M.|last2=Koeberl|first2=Christian|title=The convincing identification of terrestrial meteorite impact structures: What works, what doesn't, and why|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=98|issue=1-2|year=2010|pages=123–170|issn=00128252|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, evidence of a 31km diameter [[impact crater]] along with evidence of impact shock quartz, was found below the [[Hiawatha Glacier]] in [[Greenland]], which - it was speculated - might have been connected with the Younger Dryas period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46181450 BBC News - Greenland ice sheet hides huge 'impact crater']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of hypothetical impact==
It is conjectured that this impact event brought about the extinction of many species of North American [[Pleistocene megafauna]]. These animals included [[camel]]s, [[mammoth]]s, the [[giant short-faced bear]], and numerous other species that the proponents suggest died out at this time.&lt;ref name="Haynes b"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Haynes G |title=The catastrophic extinction of North American mammoths and mastodonts|journal=World Archaeology|date=5 November 2010|volume=33|issue=3|pages=391–416|doi=10.1080/00438240120107440}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed markers for the impact event are claimed to appear at the end of the [[Clovis culture]].&lt;ref name=Carrasco&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrasco MA, Barnosky AD, Graham RW | title = Quantifying the extent of North American mammal extinction relative to the pre-anthropogenic baseline | journal = PLOS One | volume = 4 | issue = 12 | pages = e8331 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20016820 | pmc = 2789409 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0008331 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.8331C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the hypothesis==
[[File:Tunguska event fallen trees.jpg|thumb|200px|Forest destroyed by the prototypical [[Tunguska airburst event]]]]
The initial description of this hypothesis was published in a 2006 book.&lt;ref name="Firestone2006"/&gt; The following year, a paper with the same principal authors suggested that the impact event may have led to an immediate decline in human populations in North America at that time.&lt;ref name="PNAS07A"/&gt;

Additional data purported to support the synchronous nature of the black mats was published. The authors stated that the data required further analysis, and independent analysis of other Clovis sites for verification of this evidence. The authors stated that they remained skeptical of the bolide impact hypothesis as the cause of the Younger Dryas and the megafaunal extinction. They also concluded that "...something major happened at 10,900 B.P. (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C uncalibrated) that we have yet to understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haynes CV | title = Younger Dryas "black mats" and the Rancholabrean termination in North America | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 18 | pages = 6520–5 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18436643 | pmc = 2373324 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0800560105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.6520H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electron microscopy#Transmission Electron Microscope .28TEM.29|Transmission electron microscopy]] evidence purported to show nanodiamonds from a layer assumed to correspond to the geologic moment of the event was published in the journal ''Science''.&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr RA | title = Planetary impacts.

Kennett reported that the nanodiamonds were evidence for bolide impacts from a rare swarm of carbonaceous [[chondrite]]s or [[comet]]s at the start of Younger Dryas, resulting from multiple airbursts and surface impacts. This resulted in substantial loss of plant life, megafauna and other animals.&lt;ref name="Kennett"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kennett DJ, Kennett JP, West A, Mercer C, Hee SS, Bement L, Bunch TE, Sellers M, Wolbach WS | title = Nanodiamonds in the Younger Dryas boundary sediment layer | journal = Science | volume = 323 | issue = 5910 | pages = 94 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19119227 | doi = 10.1126/science.1162819 | bibcode = 2009Sci...323...94K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study has been strenuously disputed by some scientists for a variety of technical and professional reasons. 

The disputing scientists claim that the study's conclusions could not be repeated, that further research suggests that no nanodiamonds were found,&lt;ref name="Daulton"/&gt; and that the supposed carbon spherules were, in fact, either fungus or insect feces and included modern contaminants.&lt;ref name="Boslough"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "spherules"/&gt;

'''Zachary Taylor''' (November 24, 1784 – July 9, 1850) was the 12th [[President of the United States]], serving from March 1849 until his death in July 1850. Taylor previously was a career officer in the [[United States Army]], rose to the rank of [[Major general (United States)|major general]] and became a national hero as a result of his victories in the [[Mexican–American War]]. As a result, he won election to the [[White House]] despite his vague political beliefs. His top priority as president was preserving the Union, but he died sixteen months into his term, before making any progress on the status of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], which had been inflaming tensions in Congress.

Taylor was born into a prominent family of planters who migrated westward from [[Virginia]] to [[Kentucky]] in his youth. He was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army in 1808 and made a name for himself as a [[captain (United States)|Captain]] in the [[War of 1812]]. He climbed the ranks establishing military forts along the [[Mississippi River]] and entered the [[Black Hawk War]] as a [[colonel (United States)|Colonel]] in 1832. His success in the [[Second Seminole War]] attracted national attention and earned him the nickname "Old Rough and Ready". In 1845, during the [[annexation of Texas]], President [[James K. Polk]] dispatched Taylor to the [[Rio Grande]] in anticipation of a battle with Mexico over the disputed Texas–Mexico border. The [[Mexican–American War]] broke out in April 1846, and Taylor defeated Mexican troops commanded by General [[Mariano Arista]] at the battles of [[Battle of Palo Alto|Palo Alto]] and [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma|Resaca de la Palma]] and drove his troops out of Texas. Taylor then led his troops into Mexico, where they defeated Mexican troops commanded by [[Pedro de Ampudia]] at the [[Battle of Monterrey]]. Defying orders, Taylor led his troops further south and, despite being severely outnumbered, dealt a crushing blow to Mexican forces under [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]]. Taylor's troops were transferred to the command of Major General [[Winfield Scott]], but Taylor retained his popularity.

The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] convinced the reluctant Taylor to lead their ticket in the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 presidential election]], despite his unclear political tenets and lack of interest in politics. At the [[1848 Whig National Convention]], Taylor defeated Scott and former Senator [[Henry Clay]] to take the nomination. He won the general election alongside [[New York (state)|New York]] politician [[Millard Fillmore]], defeating Democratic Party candidates [[Lewis Cass]] and [[William Orlando Butler]], as well as a third-party effort led by former president [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.]] of the [[Free Soil Party]]. Taylor became the first president to be elected without having served in a prior political office.

As president, Taylor kept his distance from Congress and his cabinet, even though partisan tensions threatened to divide the Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the [[Mexican Cession]] dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push for the expansion of slavery, and sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in [[New Mexico]] and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for [[U.S. state|statehood]], setting the stage for the [[Compromise of 1850]]. Taylor died suddenly of a stomach-related illness in July 1850, with his administration having accomplished little aside from the ratification of the [[Clayton–Bulwer Treaty]]. Fillmore served the remainder of his term. Historians and scholars have [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|ranked]] Taylor in the bottom quartile of U.S. presidents, owing in part to his short term of office (16 months), and he has been described as "more a forgettable president than a failed one."&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/special-reports/the-worst-presidents/articles/2014/12/17/worst-presidents-zachary-taylor-1849-1850|title=Worst Presidents: Zachary Taylor (1849–1850)||last=Tolson|first=Jay|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Hare Forest Farm, Orange County, VA.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Hare Forest Farm, Orange County, Virginia – Taylor's supposed birthplace]]
Zachary Taylor was born on November 24, 1784, on a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] in [[Orange County, Virginia]], to a prominent family of planters of [[English people|English]] ancestry. His birthplace may have been [[Hare Forest Farm]], the home of his maternal grandfather William Strother, though this has not been determined with certainty.&lt;ref name="vaNRHPnom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Orange/068-0124_HareForest_Final_Nomination.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Hare Forest Farm |author=Geoffrey Henry| date=March 1991|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the third of five surviving sons in his family (a sixth died in infancy) and had three younger sisters. His mother was Sarah Dabney (Strother) Taylor. His father, [[Richard Taylor (colonel)|Richard Taylor]], had served as a lieutenant colonel in the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bauer|Bauer]], pp. 1–2; [[#Hamilton-1|Hamilton, vol. 1]], pp. 21–24, 261–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor was a descendant of Elder [[William Brewster (Pilgrim)|William Brewster]], a [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrim]] leader of the [[Plymouth Colony]], a ''[[Mayflower]]'' immigrant, and a signer of the [[Mayflower Compact]]; and [[Isaac Allerton Jr.]], a [[Colonial America|colonial]] merchant, colonel, and son of ''Mayflower'' Pilgrim [[Isaac Allerton]] and [[Fear Brewster]]. Taylor's second cousin through that line was [[James Madison]], the fourth president.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 22, 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

His family forsook their exhausted [[Virginia]] land, joined the westward migration and settled near future [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], on the [[Ohio River]]. Taylor grew up in a small woodland cabin until, with increased prosperity, his family moved to a brick house. The rapid growth of Louisville was a boon for Taylor's father, who by the start of the 19th century had acquired {{convert|10000|acre|km2}} throughout Kentucky, as well as 26 slaves to cultivate the most developed portion of his holdings. Taylor's formal education was sporadic because Kentucky's education system was just taking shape during his formative years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=K.

Stoddard |date=1913 |title=Sketch of Theodore O'Hara |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5JFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA75 |magazine=The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society |location=Frankfort, KY |publisher=State Journal Company |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayer recalled Taylor as a patient and quick learner, but his early letters showed a weak grasp of spelling and grammar,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Bauer, pp. 2–4; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 25–29.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as poor handwriting. All improved over time, though his handwriting was always difficult to read.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
In June 1810, Taylor married [[Margaret Taylor|Margaret Mackall Smith]], whom he had met the previous autumn in Louisville. "Peggy" Smith came from a prominent family of [[Maryland]] planters—she was the daughter of Major Walter Smith, who had served in the Revolutionary War.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 8–9; Hamilton, vol. 1, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had six children:

===Initial commissions===
On May 3, 1808 Taylor joined the U.S. Army, receiving a [[Commissioned officer|commission]] as a [[first lieutenant]] of the [[7th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Seventh Infantry Regiment]]. He was among the new officers commissioned by Congress in response to the [[Chesapeake–Leopard Affair]], in which an American frigate had been boarded by the crew of a British warship, sparking calls for war.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. 5; Hamilton, vol. 1, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor spent much of 1809 in the dilapidated camps of [[New Orleans]] and nearby [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Terre aux Boeufs]], in the [[Territory of Orleans]]. Under the command of [[James Wilkinson]], the soldiers at Terre aux Boeufs suffered greatly from disease and lack of supplies, and Taylor was given an extended leave, returning to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] to recover.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor was promoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] in November 1810. His army duties were limited at this time, and he attended to his personal finances. Over the next several years, he began to purchase a good deal of bank stock in Louisville.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 5–10; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt; He also bought a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] in Louisville, as well as the [[Cypress Grove Plantation]] in [[Jefferson County, Mississippi|Jefferson County]], [[Mississippi Territory]]. These acquisitions included slaves, rising in number to more than 200.&lt;ref name="ANTI-SLAVERY REPORTER VOL III 1848, p 194-5"&gt;ANTI-SLAVERY REPORTER VOL III, NO XXXVI,  December 1, 1848, p 194-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Nelson, [http://www.hannapub.com/concordiasentinel/article_e62bf2da-1d86-11e4-9b77-001a4bcf6878.html Taylor's Cypress Grove Plantation], ''[[The Ouachita Citizen]]'', August 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1811 he was called to the [[Indiana Territory]], where he assumed control of [[Fort Knox (Vincennes)|Fort Knox]] after the commandant fled. In a few weeks, he was able to restore order in the garrison, for which he was lauded by Governor [[William Henry Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. 10; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor was temporarily called to Washington to testify for Wilkinson as a witness in a [[court-martial]], and so he did not take part in the November 1811 [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] against the forces of [[Tecumseh]], a [[Shawnee]] [[tribal chief|chief]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of 1812===
During the [[War of 1812]], in which U.S. forces battled the British Empire and its [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] allies, Taylor successfully defended [[Battle of Fort Harrison|Fort Harrison]] in Indiana Territory from an Indian attack commanded by Tecumseh. The September 1812 battle represented the first land victory of the war for the American forces, for which Taylor received wide praise, as well as a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] (temporary) promotion to the rank of major. According to Eisenhower, this represented the first brevet ever awarded in United States history.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Taylor joined General [[Samuel Hopkins (congressman)|Samuel Hopkins]] as an aide on two expeditions—the first into the [[Illinois Territory]] and the second to the Tippecanoe battle site, where they were forced to retreat in the [[Battle of Wild Cat Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 13–19; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor moved his growing family to Fort Knox after the violence subsided.

In the spring of 1814, he was called back into action under Brigadier General [[Benjamin Howard (Missouri)|Benjamin Howard]], and after Howard fell sick, Taylor led a 430-man expedition from [[St. Louis]], up the Mississippi River. In the [[Battle of Credit Island]], Taylor defeated Indian forces, but retreated after the Indians were joined by their British allies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt; That October he supervised the construction of [[Fort Johnson]] near present-day [[Warsaw, Illinois]], the last toehold of the U.S. Army in the upper Mississippi River Valley. Upon Howard's death a few weeks later, Taylor was ordered to abandon the fort and retreat to St. Louis. Reduced to the rank of captain when the war ended in 1815, he resigned from the army. He re-entered it a year later after gaining a commission as a major.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 20–30; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 47–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Command of Fort Howard===
For two years, Taylor commanded [[Fort Howard (Wisconsin)|Fort Howard]] at the [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Michigan Territory]] settlement, then he returned to Louisville and his family. In April 1819 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and dined with President [[James Monroe]] and General [[Andrew Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1821, Taylor took the 7th Infantry to [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], [[Louisiana]], on the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]. On the orders of General [[Edmund P. Gaines]], they set out to locate a new post more convenient to the Sabine River frontier. By the following March, Taylor had established [[Fort Jesup]], at the Shield's Spring site southwest of Natchitoches.

That November (1822) he was transferred to [[Pentagon Barracks|Baton Rouge]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.northamericanforts.com/East/laflor.html#brbarracks Baton Rouge Barracks] at NorthAmericanForts.com, accessed 01 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Louisiana]], where he remained until February 1824.&lt;ref name="Bauer pp. 40"&gt;Bauer, pp. 40–47; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 70–77.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the next few years on recruiting duty. In late 1826, he was called to [[Washington, D.C.]], for work on an Army committee to consolidate and improve military organization. In the meantime Taylor acquired his first Louisiana plantation and decided to move with his family to their new home in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].&lt;ref name="Bauer pp. 40"/&gt;

===Black Hawk War===
In May 1828, Taylor was called back to action, commanding [[Fort Snelling]] in [[Michigan Territory]] (now [[Minnesota]]) on the northern Mississippi River for a year, and then nearby [[Fort Crawford]] for a year. After some time on furlough, spent expanding his landholdings, Taylor was promoted to colonel of the [[1st Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Infantry Regiment]] in April 1832, when the [[Black Hawk War]] was beginning in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 47–59; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 77–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor campaigned under General [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]] to pursue and later defend against Chief [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]]'s forces throughout the summer. The end of the war in August 1832 signaled the final Indian resistance to U.S. expansion in the area.

During this period Taylor opposed the courtship of his 17-year-old daughter [[Sarah Knox Taylor]] with Lieutenant [[Jefferson Davis]], the future [[President of the Confederate States of America]]. He respected Davis but did not wish his daughter to become a military wife, as he knew it was a hard life for families. Davis and Sarah Taylor married in June 1835 (when she was 21), but she died three months later of [[malaria]] contracted on a visit to Davis's sister's home in [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 59–74; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 83–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Seminole War===
By 1837, the [[Second Seminole War]] was underway when Taylor was directed to Florida. He defeated the [[Seminole Indians]] in the Christmas Day [[Battle of Lake Okeechobee]], which was among the largest U.S.–Indian battles of the nineteenth century; as a result, he was promoted to brigadier general. In May 1838, Brig. Gen. [[Thomas Jesup]] stepped down and placed Taylor in command of all American troops in Florida, a position he held for two years—his reputation as a military leader was growing and he became known as "Old Rough and Ready."&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 75–95; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 122–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor was criticized for using bloodhounds in order to track Seminole.&lt;ref name="ANTI-SLAVERY REPORTER VOL III 1848, p 194-5"/&gt;

After his long-requested relief was granted, Taylor spent a comfortable year touring the nation with his family and meeting with military leaders. During this period, he began to be interested in politics and corresponded with President [[William Henry Harrison]]. He was made commander of the Second Department of the Army's Western Division in May 1841. The sizable territory ran from the Mississippi River westward, south of the [[37th parallel north]]. Stationed in [[Arkansas]], Taylor enjoyed several uneventful years, spending as much time attending to his land speculation as to military matters.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 96–110; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 142–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican–American War===
{{Main|Mexican–American War}}
In anticipation of the annexation of the [[Republic of Texas]], which had established independence in 1836, Taylor was sent in April 1844 to [[Fort Jesup]] in Louisiana, and ordered to guard against attempts by Mexico to reclaim the territory.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. 111; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 156–158.&lt;/ref&gt; There were more senior generals in the army who might have taken this important command, such as [[Winfield Scott]] and [[Edmund P. Gaines]]. But both were known members of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], and Taylor's apolitical reputation and friendly relations with Andrew Jackson made him the choice of Democratic President James K. Polk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Polk directed him to deploy into disputed territory in Texas, "on or near the [[Rio Grande]]" near Mexico. Taylor chose a spot at [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], and his [[Army of Occupation (Mexico)|Army of Occupation]] encamped there until the following spring in anticipation of a Mexican attack.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 116–123; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 158–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:General Zachary Taylor rides his horse at Palo Alto Battle - May 8, 1846.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|General Zachary Taylor rides his horse at the [[Battle of Palo Alto]], May 8, 1846]]

When Polk's attempts to negotiate with Mexico failed, Taylor's men advanced to the Rio Grande in March 1846, and war appeared imminent. Violence broke out several weeks later, when some of Captain Seth B. Thornton's men were attacked by Mexican forces north of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 123–129, 145–149; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 170–177.&lt;/ref&gt; Polk, learning of the [[Thornton Affair]], told Congress in May that a war between Mexico and the U.S. had begun.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. 166; Hamilton, vol. 1, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Taylor commanded American forces at the [[Battle of Palo Alto]] and the nearby [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]]. Though greatly outnumbered, he defeated the Mexican "Army of the North" commanded by General [[Mariano Arista]], and forced the troops back across the Rio Grande.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 152–162; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 181–190.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor was later praised for his humane treatment of the wounded Mexican soldiers prior to the prisoner exchange with General Arista, giving them the same care as was given to American wounded. After tending to the wounded, he performed the last rites for the dead of both the American and Mexican soldiers killed during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#henry|Montgomery, 1847]], pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt;

These victories made him a popular hero, and in May 1846 Taylor received a brevet promotion to major general and a formal commendation from Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, pp. 186-187&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Taylor was promoted to the full rank of major general.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The national press compared him to George Washington and Andrew Jackson, both generals who had ascended to the presidency, although Taylor denied any interest in running for office. "Such an idea never entered my head," he remarked in a letter, "nor is it likely to enter the head of any sane person."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 198–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

After crossing the Rio Grande, in September Taylor inflicted heavy casualties upon the Mexicans at the [[Battle of Monterrey]], and captured that city in three days, despite its impregnable repute. Taylor was criticized for signing a "liberal" truce, rather than pressing for a large-scale surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 166–185; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 207–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Polk had hoped that the occupation of Northern Mexico would induce the Mexicans to sell [[Alta California]] and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|New Mexico]], but the Mexicans remained unwilling to part with so much territory. Polk sent an army under the command of Winfield Scott to [[Siege of Veracruz|besiege Veracruz]], an important Mexican port city, while Taylor was ordered to remain near Monterrey. Many of Taylor's experienced soldiers were placed under the command of Scott, leaving Taylor with a smaller and less effective force. Mexican General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] intercepted a letter from Scott regarding Taylor's smaller force, and he moved north, intent on destroying Taylor's force before confronting Scott's army.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 62–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning of Santa Anna's approach, and refusing to retreat despite the Mexican army's greater numbers, Taylor established a strong defensive position near the town of [[Saltillo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Anna attacked Taylor with 20,000 men at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] in February 1847, leaving around 700 Americans dead or wounded at a cost of over 1,500 Mexican.{{efn|Estimates of casualties vary widely.&lt;ref name="eb-buenavista"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/83513/Battle-of-Buena-Vista |title=Battle of Buena Vista |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' lists casualties of about 1,500 Mexican to 700 American.&lt;ref name="eb-buenavista" /&gt; Hamilton lists the "killed or wounded" as 673 Americans to "at least eighteen hundred" Mexicans.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer lists "594 killed, 1039 wounded, and 1,854 missing" on the Mexican side, with "272 killed, 387 wounded, and 6 missing" on the American side.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Outmatched, the Mexican forces retreated, ensuring a "far-reaching" victory for the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 186–207; Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 217–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his victory at Buena Vista, on July 4, 1847 Taylor was elected an honorary member of the New York [[Society of the Cincinnati]], the Virginia branch of which included his father as a charter member. Taylor also was made a member of the [[Aztec Club of 1847]], Military Society of the Mexican War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breithaupt, Jr.|first1=Richard Hoag|title=Aztec Club of 1847 Military Society of the Mexican War|date=1998|publisher=Walika Publishing Company|location=Universal City, CA|isbn=1886085056|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor remained at Monterrey until late November 1847, when he set sail for home. While he spent the following year in command of the Army's entire western division, his active military career was effectively over. In December he received a hero's welcome in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, which set the stage for the 1848 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, vol. 1, pp. 248–255.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election of 1848==
{{Main|U.S. presidential election, 1848}}
[[File:TaylorFillmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Taylor/Fillmore 1848 campaign poster]]
In his capacity as a career officer, Taylor had never publicly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time.&lt;ref name=MCCAE/&gt; He thought of himself as an [[Independent (voter)|independent]], believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country, and thought that President [[Andrew Jackson]], a Democrat, should not have allowed the [[Second Bank of the United States]] to collapse in 1836.&lt;ref name=MCCAE/&gt; He believed it was impractical to expand slavery into the western areas of the U.S., as neither cotton nor sugar (both were produced in great quantities as a result of slavery) could be easily grown there through a [[plantation economy]].&lt;ref name=MCCAE/&gt; He was also a firm nationalist, and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare, he believed that [[secession]] was not a good way to resolve national problems.&lt;ref name=MCCAE/&gt;

Well before the American victory at Buena Vista, political clubs were formed which supported Taylor for president. His support was drawn from an unusually broad assortment of political bands, including [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and Democrats, Northerners and Southerners, allies and opponents of national leaders such as Henry Clay and James K. Polk. By late 1846 Taylor's opposition to a presidential run began to weaken, and it became clear that his principles more closely resembled Whig orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hamilton-2|Hamilton, vol. 2]], pp. 38–44.&lt;/ref&gt; As support for Taylor's candidacy grew, he continued to keep his distance from both parties, but made it clear that he would have voted for Whig [[Henry Clay]] in 1844 had he voted. In a widely publicized September 1847 letter, Taylor stated his positions on several issues. He did not favor chartering another national bank, favored a low [[tariffs in United States history|tariff]], and believed that the president should play no role in making laws. Taylor did believe that the president could veto laws, but only when they were clearly unconstitutional.{{sfn|Smith|pp=40–42}} Many southerners believed that Taylor supported slavery and its expansion into the new territory absorbed from Mexico, and some were angered when Taylor suggested that if he were elected president he would not veto the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which proposed against such an expansion.&lt;ref name=MCCAE/&gt; This position did not enhance his support from activist antislavery elements in the Northern U.S., as these wanted Taylor to speak out strongly in support of the Proviso, not simply fail to veto it.&lt;ref name=MCCAE/&gt; Most [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] did not support Taylor, since he was a slave-owner.&lt;ref name=MCCAE/&gt;

[[File:ElectoralCollege1848.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|1848 electoral vote results]]

In February 1848, Taylor again announced that he would not accept either party's presidential nomination. Taylor's reluctance to identify himself as a Whig nearly cost him the party's presidential nomination, but Senator [[John J. Crittenden]] of Kentucky and other supporters finally convinced Taylor to declare himself a Whig.{{sfn|Smith|pp=40–42}} Though Clay retained a strong following among the Whigs, Whig leaders like [[William H. Seward]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]] were eager to support a war hero who could potentially replicate the success of the party's only other successful presidential candidate, William Henry Harrison.{{sfn|Smith|pp=20–21}} At the [[1848 Whig National Convention]], Taylor defeated Clay and Winfield Scott to receive the Whig nomination for president. For his vice presidential nominee the convention chose [[Millard Fillmore]], a prominent [[New York (state)|New York]] Whig who had chaired the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]] and had been a contender for Clay's vice presidential nominee in the [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844 election]]. Fillmore's selection was largely an attempt at reconciliation with northern Whigs, who were furious at the nomination of a slaveowning southerner; all factions of the party were dissatisfied with the final ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 236–238; Hamilton, vol. 2, pp. 94–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor continued to minimize his role in the campaign, preferring not to directly meet with voters or correspond regarding his political views. His campaign was skillfully directed by Crittenden, and bolstered by a late endorsement from Senator [[Daniel Webster]] of Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 239–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Democrats were even less unified than the Whigs, as former Democratic President [[Martin Van Buren]] broke from the party and led the anti-slavery [[Free Soil Party]]'s ticket. Van Buren won the support of many Democrats and Whigs who opposed extension of slavery into the territories, but he took more votes from Democratic nominee [[Lewis Cass]] in the crucial state of New York.{{sfn|Smith|pp=21–23}} Nationally, Taylor defeated Cass and Van Buren, taking 163 of the 290 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. In the popular vote, he took 47.3%, while Cass won 42.5% and Van Buren won 10.1%. Taylor would be the last Whig to be elected president and the last person elected to the U.S. presidency from neither the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] or the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], as well as the last Southerner to win a presidential election until [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s election in [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]].&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Taylor was not the last Whig to serve as president, nor was he the last Southerner to serve as president prior to Woodrow Wilson. Taylor was succeeded in office by Fillmore, who was also a member of the Whig Party. [[Andrew Johnson]], a Southerner, served as president from 1865 to 1869. However, neither Fillmore nor Johnson were directly elected to the presidency.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor ignored the Whig platform, as historian Michael F. Holt explains:

{{quote|Taylor was equally indifferent to programs Whigs had long considered vital. Publicly, he was artfully ambiguous, refusing to answer questions about his views on banking, the tariff, and internal improvements. Privately, he was more forthright. The idea of a national bank "is dead, and will not be revived in my time." In the future the tariff "will be increased only for revenue"; in other words, Whig hopes of restoring the protective [[tariff of 1842]] were vain. There would never again be surplus federal funds from public land sales to distribute to the states, and internal improvements "will go on in spite of presidential vetoes." In a few words, that is, Taylor pronounced an epitaph for the entire Whig economic program.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Holt|Holt]], p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Transition and inauguration===
[[File:Zachary Taylor by Joseph Henry Bush, c1848.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Official White House portrait of Zachary Taylor]]

As president-elect, Taylor kept his distance from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the months following the election formulating his cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to the frustration of his fellow Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he endured a flurry of advances from office-seekers looking to play a role in his administration.&lt;ref name="Bauer, pp. 248–251"&gt;Bauer, pp. 248–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

While he would not appoint any Democrats, Taylor wanted his cabinet to reflect the nation's diverse interests, and so apportioned the seats geographically. He also avoided choosing prominent Whigs, sidestepping such obvious selections as Clay. He saw Crittenden as a cornerstone of his administration, offering him the crucial seat of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], but Crittenden insisted on serving out the Governorship of Kentucky to which he had just been elected. Taylor settled instead on Senator [[John M. Clayton]] of Delaware, a close associate of Crittenden's.&lt;ref name="Bauer, pp. 248–251"/&gt;

With Clayton's aid, Taylor chose the six remaining members of his cabinet. One of the incoming Congress's first actions would be to establish the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], so Taylor would be appointing that department's inaugural secretary. [[Thomas Ewing]], who had previously served as a senator from Ohio and as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] under William Henry Harrison, accepted the patronage-rich position of [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. For the position of [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]], which also served as a center of patronage, Taylor chose Congressman [[Jacob Collamer]] of Vermont. After [[Horace Binney]] refused appointment as Secretary of the Treasury, Taylor chose another prominent Philadelphian in [[William M. Meredith]]. [[George W. Crawford]], a former Governor of Georgia, accepted the position of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], while Congressman [[William Ballard Preston|William B. Preston]] of Virginia became [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]. Senator [[Reverdy Johnson]] of Maryland accepted appointment as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], and Johnson became one of the most influential members of Taylor's cabinet. Vice President Fillmore was not in favor with Taylor, and Fillmore was largely sidelined throughout Taylor's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 90–94, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor began his trek to Washington in late January, a journey rife with bad weather, delays, injuries, sickness—and an [[Ashland, Jefferson County, Mississippi#Deception of President Taylor|abduction]] by a family friend. Taylor finally arrived in the nation's capital on February 24 and soon met with the outgoing President Polk.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 251–253.&lt;/ref&gt; The incumbent Democrat held a low opinion of Taylor, privately deeming him "without political information" and "wholly unqualified for the station" of president.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 247–248.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor spent the following week meeting with political elites, some of whom were unimpressed with his appearance and demeanor. With less than two weeks until his inauguration, he met with Clayton and hastily finalized his cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 253–255, 260–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor's term as president began Sunday, March 4, but his inauguration was not held until the following day out of religious concerns.{{efn|Folklore holds that [[David Rice Atchison]], as ''president pro tempore'' of the Senate, unknowingly succeeded to the presidency for this day, but no major sources accept this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/the-24-hour-president |title=The 24-Hour President |work=History in the Headlines |publisher=[[The History Channel]] |date=February 18, 2013 |author=Klein, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} His inauguration speech discussed the many tasks facing the nation, but presented a governing style of deference to Congress and sectional compromise instead of assertive executive action.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 256–258.&lt;/ref&gt; His speech also emphasized the importance of following President Washington's [[Washington Doctrine of Unstable Alliances|precedent in avoiding entangling alliances]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; During the period after his inauguration, Taylor made time to meet with numerous office-seekers and other ordinary citizens who desired his attention. He also attended an unusual number of funerals, including services for former president Polk and [[Dolley Madison]]. According to Eisenhower, Taylor coined the phrase "[[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]]" in his eulogy for Madison.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the summer of 1849, Taylor toured the northeastern U.S., to familiarize himself with a region of which he had seen little. He spent much of the trip plagued by gastrointestinal illness and returned to Washington by September.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 268–270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sectional crisis===
[[File:Zachary Taylor at the White House daguerreotype by Mathew Brady 1849.jpg|thumb|[[Daguerreotype]] of Taylor at the [[White House]] by [[Mathew Brady]], 1849]]

As Taylor took office, Congress faced a battery of questions related to the [[Mexican Cession]], acquired by the U.S. after the Mexican War and divided into military districts. It was unclear which districts would be established into states and which would become federal territories, while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress. Additionally, many in the South had grown increasingly angry about the aid that northerners had given to [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]]. While a southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; His major goal was sectional peace, preserving the Union through legislative compromise.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 289–290.&lt;/ref&gt; As the threat of Southern secession grew, he sided increasingly with antislavery northerners such as Senator [[William H. Seward]] of New York, even suggesting that he would sign the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 295–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Taylor's view, the best way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery question out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the [[Gold Rush]] was well underway at the time of his inauguration, and California's population was exploding.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 290–291.&lt;/ref&gt; The administration dispatched Rep. [[Thomas Butler King]] to California, to test the waters and advocate on behalf of statehood, knowing that the Californians were certain to adopt an anti-slavery constitution. King found that a constitutional convention was already underway, and by October 1849, the convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 291–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:United States 1849-1850.png|thumb|upright=1.15|left|United States states and territories throughout Taylor's presidency]]

The question of the New Mexico–Texas border was unsettled at the time of Taylor's inauguration. The territory newly won from Mexico was under federal jurisdiction, but the Texans claimed a swath of land north of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and were determined to include it within their borders, despite having no significant presence there. Taylor sided with the New Mexicans' claim, initially pushing to keep it as a federal territory, but eventually supported statehood so as to further reduce the slavery debate in Congress. The Texas government, under newly instated governor [[P. Hansborough Bell]], tried to ramp up military action in defense of the territory against the federal government, but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 292–294.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Latter Day Saint]] settlers of modern-day Utah had established a provisional [[State of Deseret]], an enormous swath of territory which had little hope of recognition by Congress. The Taylor administration considered combining the California and Utah territories, but instead opted to organize the [[Utah Territory]]. To alleviate the Mormon population's concerns over religious freedom, Taylor promised they would have relative independence from Congress despite being a federal territory.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor sent his only [[State of the Union address|State of the Union report]] to Congress in December 1849. He recapped international events and suggested several adjustments to tariff policy and executive organization, but such issues were overshadowed by the sectional crisis facing Congress. He reported on California's and New Mexico's applications for statehood, and recommended that Congress approve them as written and "should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character".&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. 298–299.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy report was prosaic and unemotional, but ended with a sharp condemnation of secessionists. It had no effect on Southern legislators, who saw the admission of two free states as an existential threat, and Congress remained stalled.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign affairs===

Meredith]], Secretary of the Treasury; [[William B. Preston]], Secretary of the Navy; [[George W. Crawford]], Secretary of War; [[Jacob Collamer]], Postmaster General; [[Thomas Ewing]], Secretary of the Interior; and [[John M. Clayton]], Secretary of State. [[Lithograph]] by Francis D'Avignon, published by [[Mathew Brady]], 1849.&lt;/small&gt;]]

Taylor and his Secretary of State, [[John M. Clayton]], both lacked diplomatic experience, and came into office at a relatively uneventful time in American–international politics. Their shared nationalism allowed Taylor to devolve foreign policy matters to Clayton with minimal oversight, although no decisive foreign policy was established under their administration.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, 273–274, 288.&lt;/ref&gt; As opponents of the autocratic European order, they vocally supported German and Hungarian liberals in the [[revolutions of 1848]], although they offered little in the way of aid.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 274–275.&lt;/ref&gt; A perceived insult from the French minister Guillaume Tell Poussin nearly led to a break in diplomatic relations until Poussin was replaced, and a [[reparation (legal)|reparation]] dispute with Portugal resulted in harsh words from the Taylor administration. In a more positive effort, the administration arranged for two ships to assist in the United Kingdom's search for a team of British explorers, led by [[John Franklin]], who had gotten lost in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 275–278.&lt;/ref&gt; While previous Whig administrations had emphasized Pacific trade as an economic imperative, the Taylor administration took no major initiative in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 287–288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1849 and 1850, they contended with [[Narciso López]], the [[Venezuela]]n radical who led repeated [[Filibuster (military)|filibustering expeditions]] in an attempt to conquer the island of [[Cuba]]. The annexation of Cuba was the object of fascination among many in the South, who saw in Cuba a potential new slave state, and López had several prominent Southern supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt; López made generous offers to American military leaders to support him, but Taylor and Clayton saw the enterprise as illegal. They issued a blockade, and later, authorized a mass arrest of López and his fellows, although the group would eventually be acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, 278–280.&lt;/ref&gt; They also confronted Spain, which had arrested several Americans on the charge of piracy, but the Spaniards eventually surrendered them to maintain good relations with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, 280–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably the Taylor administration's definitive accomplishment in foreign policy was the [[Clayton–Bulwer Treaty]] of 1850, regarding a proposed inter-oceanic canal through Central America. While the U.S. and Britain were on friendly terms, and the construction of such a canal was decades away from reality, the mere possibility put the two nations in an uneasy position.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, Britain had been seizing strategic points, particularly the [[Mosquito Coast]] on the eastern coast of present-day [[Nicaragua]]. Negotiations were held with Britain that resulted in the landmark Clayton–Bulwer Treaty. Both nations agreed not to claim control of any canal that might be built in Nicaragua. The treaty promoted development of an Anglo-American alliance; its completion was Taylor's last action as president.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 281–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compromise attempts and final days===
Clay took a central role as Congress debated the slavery question. While his positions had some overlap with Taylor's, the president always maintained his distance from Clay. Historians disagree on his motivations for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 301, 307–308.&lt;/ref&gt; With assistance from Daniel Webster, Clay developed his landmark proposal, the [[Compromise of 1850]]. The proposal allowed statehood for California, giving it independence on the slavery question, while the other territories would remain under federal jurisdiction. This would include the disputed parts of New Mexico, although Texas would be reimbursed for the territory. Slavery would be retained in the District of Columbia, but the slave trade would be banned. Meanwhile, a strict [[Fugitive Slave Law]] would be enacted, bypassing northern legislation which had restricted Southerners from retrieving runaway slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions flared as Congress negotiated and secession talks grew, culminating with a threat from Taylor to send troops into New Mexico to protect its border from Texas, with himself leading the army. Taylor also said that anyone "taken in rebellion against the Union, he would hang ... with less reluctance than he had hanged deserters and spies in Mexico." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/zacharytaylor|title=Zachary Taylor|work=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The omnibus law was a major step forward but ultimately could not pass, due to extremists on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 301–312.&lt;/ref&gt;

No great compromise reached Taylor's desk during his presidency; instead, his last days were overshadowed by the [[Galphin affair]]. Before joining the Taylor cabinet, Secretary of War Crawford had served as a lawyer. He had been involved in a fifteen-year case, representing the descendants of a colonial trader whose services to the British crown had not been repaid at the time of the American Revolution. The British debt to George Galphin was to be assumed by the federal government, but Galphin's heirs only received payment on the debt's principal after years of litigation, and were unable to win an interest payment from the Polk administration. Treasury Secretary Meredith, with the support of Attorney General Johnson, finally signed off on the payment in April 1850. To the president's embarrassment, this payment included a legal compensation of nearly $100,000 to Crawford; two cabinet members had effectively offered a tremendous chunk of the public treasury to another. A House investigation cleared Crawford of any legal wrongdoing, but nonetheless expressed disapproval of his accepting the payment. Taylor, who had already been sketching out a re-organization of his cabinet, now had an unfolding scandal to complicate the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Zachary Taylor-circa1850.jpg|thumb|upright|Zachary Taylor in 1850]]

On July 4, 1850, Taylor reportedly consumed copious amounts of raw fruit and iced milk while attending holiday celebrations during a fund-raising event at the [[Washington Monument]], which was then under construction.&lt;ref&gt;(1) Smith, p. 156.&lt;br /&gt;(2) Bauer, p. 314&lt;br /&gt;(3) {{cite book|last=Perry|first=John|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H4ig_dTZbzkC&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Lee: A Life of Virtue|publisher=Thomas Nelson|location=[[Nashville, Tennessee]]|year=2010|pages=93–94|isbn=1595550283|oclc=456177249}} At [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of several days, he became severely ill with an unknown digestive ailment. His doctor "diagnosed the illness as [[cholera morbus]], a flexible mid-nineteenth-century term for intestinal ailments as diverse as diarrhea and dysentery but not related to Asiatic cholera", the latter being a widespread epidemic at the time of Taylor's death.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 314–316.&lt;/ref&gt; The identity and source of Taylor's illness are the subject of historical speculation (see below), although it is known that several of his cabinet members had come down with a similar illness.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhower, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fever ensued and Taylor's chance of recovery was small. On July 8, Taylor remarked to a medical attendant:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I should not be surprised if this were to terminate in my death. I did not expect to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency. God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty. But I have been mistaken. My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_American_nation.html?id=X7dYAAAAMAAJ |title=The American nation: its executive ... – Google Books |publisher=Williams Publishing Co. |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2014|year=1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite treatment, Taylor died at 10:35&amp;nbsp;p.m. on July 9, 1850. He was 65 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, Vice President Fillmore assumed the presidency and completed Taylor's term, which ended on March 4, 1853. Soon after taking office, Fillmore signed into law the [[Compromise of 1850]], which settled many of the issues faced by the Taylor administration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor was interred in the Public Vault of the [[Congressional Cemetery]] in Washington, D.C., from July 13, 1850, to October 25, 1850. (It was built in 1835 to hold remains of notables until either the grave site could be prepared or transportation arranged to another city.) His body was transported to the Taylor Family plot where his parents were buried on the old Taylor homestead plantation known as "Springfield" in Louisville, Kentucky.

==Historical reputation and memorials==
[[File:Zachary Taylor Grave.JPG|thumb|right|Taylor's mausoleum at the [[Zachary Taylor National Cemetery]] in Louisville, Kentucky]]
Because of his short tenure, Taylor is not considered to have strongly influenced the office of the Presidency or the United States.&lt;ref name=MCIL&gt;{{cite web |title = Zachary Taylor: Impact and Legacy |publisher = Miller Center of Public Affairs |url = http://millercenter.org/president/taylor/essays/biography/9 |accessdate = January 12, 2009 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101217094438/http://millercenter.org/president/taylor/essays/biography/9 |archivedate = December 17, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians believe that Taylor was too inexperienced with politics, at a time when officials needed close ties with political operatives.&lt;ref name=MCIL/&gt; Despite his shortcomings, the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty affecting relations with Great Britain in Central America is "recognized as an important step in scaling down the nation's commitment to [[Manifest Destiny]] as a policy."&lt;ref name=MCIL/&gt; While [[historical rankings of Presidents of the United States]] have generally placed Taylor in the bottom quarter of chief executives, most surveys tend to rank him as the most effective of the four presidents from the Whig Party.

Taylor was the last president to [[Slavery in the United States|own slaves]] while in office. He was the third of four Whig presidents,&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;This numbering includes [[John Tyler]], who served as vice president under the Whig [[William Henry Harrison]] but was expelled from his party shortly after becoming president.&lt;/ref&gt; the last being Fillmore, his successor. Taylor was also the second president to die in office, preceded by [[William Henry Harrison]], who died while serving as president nine years earlier.

In 1883, the [[Commonwealth of Kentucky]] placed a 50-foot monument topped by a life-sized statue of Taylor near his grave. By the 1920s, the Taylor family initiated the effort to turn the Taylor burial grounds into a national cemetery. The Commonwealth of Kentucky donated two adjacent parcels of land for the project, turning the half-acre Taylor family cemetery into {{convert|16|acre|m2}}. On May 6, 1926, the remains of Taylor and his wife (who died in 1852) were moved to the newly constructed Taylor mausoleum, made of limestone with a granite base and marble interior, nearby. The cemetery property has been designated as the [[Zachary Taylor National Cemetery]].

The US Post Office released [[US Presidents on US postage stamps|the first postage stamp issue]] honoring Zachary Taylor on June 21, 1875, 25 years after his death. In 1938, Taylor would appear again on a US postage stamp, this time on the 12-cent [[Presidential Issue|Presidential Issue of 1938]]. Taylor's last appearance (to date, 2010) on a US postage stamp occurred in 1986, when he was honored on the [[U.S. Presidents on U.S. postage stamps#AMERIPEX issues of 1986|AMERIPEX presidential issue]]. After Washington, Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln, Zachary Taylor was the fifth American president to appear on US postage.&lt;ref&gt;Scotts Identifier of US Definitive Issues&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination theories==
[[File:TAYLOR, Zachary-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|B.E.P.]] engraved portrait]]
Almost immediately after his death, rumors began to circulate that Taylor was poisoned by pro-slavery Southerners, and similar theories persisted into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willard and Marion|title=Killing the President|year=2010|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/5/29/117856/- "The Strange Death of Zachary Taylor", by Tony Seybert, ''The Daily Kos'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Hamilton Smith based his assassination theory on the timing of drugs, the lack of confirmed cholera outbreaks, and other material.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Smith, "The Interpretation of the Arsenic Content of Human Hair," ''Journal of the Forensic Science Society'', vol.&amp;nbsp;4, summarized in Sten Forshufvud and Ben Weider, ''Assassination at St. Helena'' (Vancouver, Canada: Mitchell Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, Clara Rising, a former professor at University of Florida, persuaded Taylor's closest living relative to agree to an exhumation so that his remains could be tested.&lt;ref name="orlando_july2593"&gt;{{cite news |last=McLeod|first=Michael |title=Clara Rising, Ex-uf Prof Who Got Zachary Taylor Exhumed |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-07-25/news/9307230997_1_zachary-taylor-arsenic-daniel-webster |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |date=July 25, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains were exhumed and transported to the Office of the [[Kentucky]] Chief Medical Examiner on June 17, 1991. Samples of hair, fingernail, and other tissues were removed, and radiological studies were conducted. The remains were returned to the cemetery and reinterred, with appropriate honors, in the mausoleum.&lt;ref name="Marriott"/&gt;

[[Neutron activation analysis]] conducted at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] revealed no evidence of poisoning, as [[arsenic]] levels were too low.&lt;ref name="Marriott"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marriott|first=Michel|title=Verdict In: 12th President Was Not Assassinated|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/27/us/verdict-in-12th-president-was-not-assassinated.html?ref=zacharytaylor17841850|accessdate=October 17, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ORNL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev27-12/text/ansside6.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710051721/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev27-12/text/ansside6.html |archivedate=July 10, 2013 |title=President Zachary Taylor and the Laboratory: Presidential Visit from the Grave |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis concluded Taylor had contracted "cholera morbus, or acute gastroenteritis", as Washington had open sewers, and his food or drink may have been contaminated. Any potential for recovery was overwhelmed by his doctors, who treated him with "[[Syrup of ipecac|ipecac]], [[Mercury(I) chloride|calomel]], [[opium]], and [[quinine]]" at 40&amp;nbsp;grains per dose (approximately 2.6 grams), and "bled and blistered him too."&lt;ref name="Sampas"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sampas|first=Jim|title=Scandal and the Heat Did Zachary Taylor In|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/04/opinion/l-scandal-and-the-heat-did-zachary-taylor-in-998691.html|accessdate=October 17, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 4, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Michael Parenti]] questions the traditional explanation for Taylor's death.
