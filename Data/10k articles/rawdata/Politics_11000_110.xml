Davis|title=Dictionary of American Library Biography: Second supplement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91UjM6TLRJgC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=23 September 2013|date=January 2003|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=978-1-56308-868-1|pages=5–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; became one of the United States’ most adamant fighters for the freedom of expression though his work as a lawyer and library advocate.&lt;ref name=mem&gt;"In memoriam: Alexander Peter Allain 1920-1994", ''Louisiana Libraries'', Winter 2006, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; His career was devoted to securing [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights for libraries.

Allain is recognized as one of ''[[American Libraries]]''' “100 of the Most Important Leaders we had in the 20th Century” for being “a true visionary” in his battle to uphold the First Amendment; his work with the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) included helping with the creation of the Office for Intellectual Freedom in 1967 and cofounding the [[Freedom to Read Foundation]].&lt;ref name=al&gt;Kniffel, L., Sullivan, P., &amp; McCormick, E. (December 1999). "100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century", ''American Libraries'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born in [[Louisiana]], as a young man, Allain served as a liaison officer in the [[French Navy]] during [[World War II]], stationed in [[Casablanca]].  After serving time in the navy, he received his law degree from [[Loyola University New Orleans]] in 1942.  In 1953, Allain was appointed to the St. Mary Parish Library Board of Control in Louisiana.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;Allain, Alexander Peter, in ''Directory of Library &amp; Information Professionals'' (Vol. 1, pp. 13-14). Woodbridge, CN: Research Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that the United States feared [[communism]] and scrutinized libraries for harboring any information that could potentially influence the public opinion.&lt;ref name="mem" /&gt; This was an influential time in Allain’s life as he went on to make [[intellectual freedom]] cases his life’s work.

== The Louisiana Library Association ==
Allain was very involved in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090318105420/http://llaonline.org/ Louisiana Library Association (LLA)] as well as the ALA. In 1964, he was the first chair of the Louisiana Library Association Intellectual Freedom Committee,&lt;ref name="mem" /&gt; and he continued to stay active in the state association throughout his life. He was instrumental in the formation of the Council of Louisiana Trustees (COLT), which worked to organize library trustee activity in Louisiana.&lt;ref name="mem" /&gt; He also served in numerous other capacities such as chair and vice-chair of the LLA Trustees Section.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

== The Freedom to Read Foundation and the American Library Association ==
One of Allain’s biggest contributions to fight for intellectual freedom within libraries was the work he did with ALA’s Office of Intellectual Freedom to co-founded the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090505042606/http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/othergroups/freedomtoreadfoundation/index.cfm Freedom to Read Foundation] (FTRF) in 1969.&lt;ref name=ftrf&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/othergroups/freedometoreadfoudnation/aboutftrf/aboutftrf.cfm About the Freedom to Read Foundation]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (cited 26 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the Freedom to Read Foundation Web site, the organization was founded as “the American Library Association’s response to its members’ interest in having adequate means to support and defend librarians whose positions are jeopardized because of their resistance to abridgments of the First Amendment; and to set legal precedent for the freedom to read on behalf of all people”.&lt;ref name="ftrf" /&gt;

The FTRF has four core purposes which include: “Promoting and protecting the [[freedom of speech]] and of the press; protecting the public’s right to access to information and materials stored in the nation’s libraries; safeguarding libraries’ right to disseminate all materials contained in their collections; and supporting libraries and librarians in their defense of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights by supplying them with legal counsel or other means to secure it”.&lt;ref name="ftrf" /&gt; The services that the FTRF provide to carry out their mission and purpose involve raising funds through grants and disseminating this monetary aid to people and institutions that need the assistance in court proceedings; aside from providing monetary assistance, the FTRF is something involved directly in the cases.&lt;ref name="ftrf" /&gt;

The FTRF was set up in conjunction with the ALA’s office of Intellectual Freedom instead of as a separate entity because of the work ALA was already doing to protect the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and intellectual freedom. When the Foundation was being planned for and organized, Allain expressed concern in a letter to the Director of the Intellectual Freedom Office, [[Judith Krug]], that ALA members would forget what the ALA has done and continues to do for intellectual freedom by covering themselves in this new umbrella of aid and assistance in the FTRF.&lt;ref name=jk&gt;Allain, Alex P. Letter to Judith F. Krug. 7 October 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Allain felt that there should be overlap of both organizations so that the focus remained centered on intellectual freedom and could be worked on in harmony.&lt;ref name="jk" /&gt;

Allain also felt that in forming the FTRF with the ALA, the Foundation would be able to benefit from some of the clout and connections that ALA already had.&lt;ref name="jk" /&gt; He also suggested keeping policies between the two organizations similar because of his belief in the good work that the ALA does; he was continuously concerned about the ALA in his creation of the foundation and did not want members to see the foundation as a replacement but rather an addition to.&lt;ref name="jk" /&gt;

== Other works, achievements and involvements ==
Library trustees, along with intellectual freedom, were another area of Allain’s interest and expertise. Some of his publications in this area include, “Trustees &amp; Censorship,” The Library Trustee: a Practical Guidebook, 1964; “Public Library Governing Bodies &amp; Intellectual Freedom”, Library Trends, July 1970; and “The First &amp; Fourteenth Amendment as They Support Libraries, Librarians, Library Systems &amp; Library Development”, Illinois Libraries, January 1974.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

According to an article in memory of Allain in Louisiana Libraries, he won many awards including: LLA’s Modisette Award for Trustees (1965), ALA’s Trustee Award (1969), the University of Illinois’ Robert B. Downs Award (1973), ALA Honorary Life Membership (1975), the John Phillip Immroth Memorial Award (1979), the Freedom to Read Foundation Roll of Honor Award (1989 and 1999), the Southeastern Library Association President’s Award (1990) and the LLA Intellectual Freedom Award (1991).&lt;ref name="mem" /&gt; The Franklin branch of the St. Mary Parish Library in Louisiana is named in Allain's memory.

Outside of his professional life, Allain was an avid volunteer in the community. He was a member of [[Rotary International]], [[Knights of Columbus]], [[Scouting]] and his Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

[[File:Apollinariya Yakubova c. 1900.png|thumb|Apollinariya Yakubova as a prisoner in Siberia, c. 1900.]]

'''Apollinariya Yakubova''' (Аполлинария Александровна Якубова, died 1913 or 1917) was a Russian [[Marxist]] revolutionary and, with [[Vladimir Lenin]], one of the founders of the [[League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian 5 May 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Topping|first1=Alexandra|title=Lenin's lover? Picture of woman described as his true love uncovered|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/05/lenin-lover-photograph-discovered-russia-communist|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakubova was the daughter of a priest, and studied physics and mathematics in St. Petersburg. After escaping a prison camp in Siberia where she had been held for her revolutionary activity, Yakubova and her husband fled to London around 1900, where she was active in organizing debates on communist doctrine.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 5 May 2015" /&gt;

She became close friends with Lenin's wife [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] and also associated closely with Lenin when he was in  London, although the two eventually fell out over doctrinal disagreements. The American journalist Louis Fischer advanced, in 1964, the theory that she rejected a proposal of marriage by Lenin, and whether for this reason or another, she also earned the enmity of her former friend Krupskaya.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 5 May 2015" /&gt;

Yakubova returned to Russia with her husband in 1908, but what became of her then is unknown, and her date of death is variously given as 1913 or 1917. According to the historian Robert Henderson, "be it by decree of Lenin, or Krupskaya, or for some other entirely different reason, [Yakubova] appears to have been almost written out of history".&lt;ref name="The Guardian 5 May 2015" /&gt;

{{for|consideration of bills by the Senate 'in committee'|Committee of the Whole}}

The '''committees of the Australian Senate''' are [[committee]]s of [[Senate of Australia|Senator]]s, established by the [[Australian Senate]], for purposes determined by that body. Senate committees are part of the operation of the Australian parliament, and have for some decades been involved in maintenance of government [[accountability]] to the Australian parliament, particularly through hearings to scrutinise the [[government budget|budget]], and through public inquiries on policy questions.

==History of the committees==
[[File:Australian Parliament Parliamentary Committees.webm|thumb|A short video on Australian Parliamentary Committees]]
The existence of parliamentary committees is mentioned in section 49 of the [[Constitution of Australia]], which makes reference to 'The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House...' However, the Senate had few committees, engaged in limited activities, until 1970.&lt;ref name="J.R. Odgers"&gt;J.R. Odgers, ''Australian Senate Practice'' (11th edn), Department of the Senate, Canberra, Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ''domestic'' committees had operated since the establishment of the parliament, but prior to 1970 the only significant committee to be established was the [[Regulations and Ordinances Committee]] in 1932, one of the ''legislative scrutiny'' committees (see below).

In 1970, the present committee system was created, with a series of [[standing committee|standing (permanent) committees]] established that mirrored the portfolio activities of government.&lt;ref name="J.R. Odgers"/&gt; These reforms significantly enhanced the expertise and power of the Senate:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Senate is now undergoing the most fundamental and dramatic changes witnessed in the Commonwealth Parliament since the States decided to federate 70 years ago. The introduction of a wide-ranging committee system will make the red-carpeted Upper House potentially the most powerful parliamentary chamber in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', 3 November 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These reforms were also significant in that they gave to Senate committees the role of examining the budget (what is referred to as the ''estimates process'' or ''estimates hearings''), which had hitherto been confined to the Senate and its [[committee of the whole]]. The role of the committees was enhanced by three subsequent developments. First, in 1982 the [[Scrutiny of Bills Committee]] was established, which, in examining all bills, played a role that complemented that of the examination of all delegated legislation by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic referral of bills to committees, increasing the level of legislative scrutiny taking place within parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Vander Wyk, J. and Lilley, A., (2005), 'Reference of Bills to Australian Senate Committees', ''Papers on Parliament'', no. 43, Department of the Senate, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt; Third, in 1993, the committees adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial budget estimates hearings. These second hearings are referred to as ''supplementary budget estimates''. Though the committee system was restructured in 1994, 2006 and again in 2009, the range of functions has remained essentially the same.

==Purposes of committees==
The functions of committees depend on the type of committee and on the work it is undertaking. Most of the committees are established under the Senate's [[Rules of order|Standing Orders]].

===Standing committees===
The Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees (often referred to simply as 'standing committees') are established by Standing Order 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/standing_orders/b05.htm#25 Senate Standing Order 25], retrieved September 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129011549/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/standing_orders/b05.htm#25 |date=29 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standing committees are actually made up of pairs of committees&amp;nbsp;–  a legislation committee and a references committee. The '''legislation committees''' are responsible for scrutinising bills referred to them by the chamber; examining the government's budget and activities (in what is called the budget estimates process);&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/briefs/brief5.htm 'Consideration of Estimates by the Senate’s Legislation Committees'], ''Senate Brief'' number 5, February 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630074222/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/briefs/brief5.htm |date=30 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for examining departmental annual reports and activities. The '''references committees''' are responsible for conducting inquiries into topics referred to them by the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;From 2006 to 2009 these pairs of committees were integrated into one committee. Details are provided elsewhere in the article.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Select committees===
[[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select committees]] are temporary committees, established by the Senate to deal with particular issues. This may occur when a particular group of Senators wishes to examine an issue in depth, or where there is no existing committee suited to addressing a particular topic. Australian Senate select committees have included ones set up to examine the Administration of Indigenous Affairs{{dead link|date=September 2012}}, and Mental Health{{dead link|date=September 2012}}. Select committees usually cease to exist upon reporting back to the chamber. One exception to this was the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation{{dead link|date=September 2012}} which in various forms existed for a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/pops/pop45/pop45.pdf ''A Light of Reason: The Work of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation''], Papers on Parliament No. 45, Department of the Senate, August 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605024617/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/pops/pop45/pop45.pdf |date=5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic committees===
Domestic committees are responsible for administering aspects of the Senate's own affairs. The '''selection of bills committee''' meets each sitting fortnight to consider which of the [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] coming before the Senate will be referred to committees for detailed consideration. The '''procedure committee''' considers "any matter relating to the procedures of the Senate referred to it by the Senate or by the [[President of the Australian Senate|President]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/standing_orders/b05.htm#17 Senate Standing Order 17], retrieved September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129011549/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/standing_orders/b05.htm#17 |date=29 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This committee thus regularly examines and reports back to the chamber on suggested changes to the operation of the Senate and its committees, such as what times of day the chamber will sit and what rules should govern its order of business.

Established by Standing Order 18 of the Senate, the '''privileges committee''' is responsible for reporting on matters of [[parliamentary privilege]] referred to it by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/priv_ctte/ctte_info/index.htm Senate Standing Committee of Privileges], retrieved September 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605024127/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/priv_ctte/ctte_info/index.htm |date=5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protections afforded by parliamentary privilege are essential to parliament and its committees to be able to operate effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/briefs/brief11.htm 'Parliamentary Privilege'], ''Senate Brief'' No 11, September 2006, retrieved September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103224005/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/briefs/brief11.htm |date=3 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the work of the privileges committee's work is associated with facilitating a 'right of reply' for people adversely named in the Senate, as well as involving investigations of unauthorised disclosures of Senate committee proceedings,&lt;ref&gt;Committee of Privileges [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/priv_ctte/report_122/report/index.htm ''Parliamentary privilege — unauthorised disclosure of committee proceedings''], 122nd Report, 2005, retrieved September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713161424/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/priv_ctte/report_122/report/index.htm |date=13 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; complaints from witnesses in connection with evidence given to committees, and allegedly misleading evidence given to committees.&lt;ref&gt;Committee of Privileges, [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/priv_ctte/completed_inquiries/2002-04/report_107/index.htm ''Parliamentary Privilege Precedents, Procedures and Practice in the Australian Senate 1966–2002''], 107th Report, 2002, retrieved September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605024253/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/priv_ctte/completed_inquiries/2002-04/report_107/index.htm |date=5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative scrutiny committees===
The purpose of the '''scrutiny of bills committee''' is to assess "legislative proposals against a set of accountability standards that focus on the effect of proposed legislation on individual rights, liberties and obligations, and on parliamentary propriety".&lt;ref&gt;Australian Parliament website, ''Scrutiny of bills committee'' http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/scrutiny/cominfo.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The '''regulations and ordinances''' committee performs a similar task, but for all [[delegated legislation|subordinate legislation]].

===Other committees===
Senators may be members of [[joint committee]]s: committees jointly established by both chambers of the [[Australian parliament]]. In addition, political parties will often have [[caucus]] committees comprising members of the parliamentary party; these committees will often have a policy focus, but are not committees of the parliament and are not bound by any of parliament's rules of procedures.

==Membership and rules of committees==
The Senate's committees are formed at the commencement of each new parliament, in accordance with rules set out in the Standing Orders. The committees exist until the first day of the following parliament, in contrast to the lower house committees, which cease to exist as soon as parliament is [[Legislative session|prorogued]] for an election.

The most important and high profile of the committees are the pairs of standing committees. These each have six members. The chairman of each legislation committee is chosen from amongst the government members, the deputy chair from amongst non-government members. The reverse is the case for the references committees. Because the chair has a [[casting vote]] in the event of a committee vote being tied, the government effectively controls the legislation committees, while the non-government parties control the references committees.&lt;ref&gt;This system has operated since 1994, with a brief hiatus from September 2006 to May 2009. During that period, reforms were implemented that were intended to streamline committee operations, and which reflected the fact that the government secured a majority of seats in the chamber at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 election]]. See:
*Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin, [http://www.financeminister.gov.au/media/2006/mr_462006.html 'Senate adopts Committee reform'] u/7.30/content/2006/s1668754.htm 'Senate changes threaten democracy: Beazley'], ''7:30 Report'' (ABC TV), 21 June 2006, retrieved September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829113051/http://www.financeminister.gov.au/media/2006/mr_462006.html |date=29 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Committees have two types of members: full members and participating members. In the case of standing committees, full members are the six outlined above. In addition, however, any Senator may arrange for the Senate to agree to their being made a participating member of the committee. This gives them the same rights as full members, with the important exception of being unable to vote on motions in private meetings of the committees.

The committees are governed by the Standing Orders of the Senate, as well as being able to pass their own resolutions to govern certain aspects of their operations (such as the processing of correspondence and submissions to inquiries).

Committees are designed to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/standing_orders/b05.htm#38 Senate Standing Order 38], retrieved September 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129011549/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/standing_orders/b05.htm#38 |date=29 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/standing_orders/b05.htm#35 Senate Standing Orders 35 and 36], retrieved September 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129011549/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/standing_orders/b05.htm#35 |date=29 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel from place to place to hear evidence.&lt;ref&gt;The following committees are empowered to travel for meetings: privileges committee (Standing Order 18); appropriations and staffing (Standing Order 19), scrutiny of bills (Standing Order 24), legislative and general purpose (Standing Order 25)&lt;/ref&gt; Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Copy_of_standingorders/~/link.aspx?_id=407AE92897D9482981EC62840CF0FB33&amp;_z=z Senate Standing Order 34], retrieved April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief13 'Rights and Responsibilities of Witnesses before Senate Committees'], ''Senate Brief'' No 13, February 2013, retrieved April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (''[[in camera]]''), and regularly do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/standing_orders/b05.htm#37 Senate Standing Order 37], retrieved September 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129011549/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/standing_orders/b05.htm#37 |date=29 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of [[New South Wales]] [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories#New South Wales|parliamentary]] committees).&lt;ref&gt;New South Wales Legislative Assembly, ''Standing Orders'', 21 November 2006, SO 303&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules governing committees are slightly different when conducting budget estimates hearings.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/briefs/brief05.htm ' Consideration of Estimates by the Senate Committees'], ''Senate Brief'' No 5, September 2006, retrieved September 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103224038/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/briefs/brief05.htm |date=3 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, during estimates hearings, 
* any Senator may ask questions of the officials appearing before the committee (normally only members can ask questions)
* no evidence can be taken on a confidential basis (normally this is an option available to a committee)
* under Standing Orders, Senators may direct questions to any government agency, but only within the portfolio areas for which the committee has oversight. The committee cannot restrict the agencies to which Senators may direct questions (although the committee can control whether this happens at the public hearing, or whether it must be done in writing afterwards).

==The work of Senate committees==
A typical year in the life of a Senate legislation committee will see it conduct eight days of hearings around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (supplementary budget estimates). In addition, it will typically conduct several inquiries into pieces of legislation being considered by the parliament. A references committee will conduct inquiries into policy issues referred to it by the Senate. Each of these inquiries will usually result in a report tabled in the Senate (there may be exceptions if an election intervenes during the committee's deliberations). A consolidated list of the reports{{dead link|date=September 2012}} prepared by all Senate committees since 1970 is published by the Department of the Senate.

They face a second desk at which an individual is also seated behind a microphone. Off to the side is a third desk with technical staff seated behind sound recording and mixing equipment. |A Senate committee hearing, showing witness (left), transcription and broadcasting staff (back) and Senators (right)]]

===Inquiries into topics and bills===
Committee inquiries typically begin with the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/briefs/brief04.htm 'Senate Committees'], ''Senate Brief'' No 4, September 2006, retrieved September 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026021602/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/briefs/brief04.htm |date=26 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee will make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put to the committee.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Holland,  'Parliamentary committees as an arena for policy work', in Colebatch, H. (ed.), ''Beyond the Policy Cycle: The Policy Process in Australia'', Allen &amp; Unwin, Sydney, 2006, pp 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Dermody, Ian Holland, and Elton Humphery, 'Parliamentary Committees and Neglected Voices in Society', ''The Table'', vol. 74, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver a report to the Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/standing_orders/d10.htm#37 Resolution of the Senate 14 March 1973], retrieved September 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909211325/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/standing_orders/d10.htm#37 |date=9 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scrutiny of the budget===
Following the introduction of [[appropriation bill]]s into the Parliament, the expenditure proposed in those bills is referred to Senate legislation committees for inquiry.&lt;ref name="J.R. Odgers"/&gt; Such referrals result in what are generally known as budget estimates hearings. Senate standing committees will usually conduct eight days of hearings around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (supplementary budget estimates).

During these hearings ministers, assisted by senior public servants, answer questions put to them by any Senator that relate to the operations and expenditure of departments and agencies that receive federal government funding.&lt;ref&gt;Vander Wyk, J., (2006), ''The Senate&amp;nbsp;–  Guide to Committee Procedure and Practice'', Senate Committee Office, Canberra, chapter 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In such hearings, ministers from the House of Representatives are represented by a minister who is also a Senator.

Budget and management reforms in the 1980s and 1990s saw a change in [[government budget|budgeting]], including a greater emphasis on outcomes, and decreasing emphasis on inputs. This has been reflected in the activities of Senate committees, with Senators' questions being increasingly focussed on the 'results of government activities and away from a concern with inputs'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mulgan, 'The accountability priorities of Australian parliamentarians', ''Australian Journal of Public Administration'', Vol. 67, no. 4, 2008, pp 457–469.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Impact of Senate committees==
The impact of the Senate's committees varies and has been the subject of debate. The work of the committees is frequently more consensual and less partisan than activity in the parliamentary chambers, and unanimous committee reports that agree recommendations across party lines are not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Bach, ''Platypus and Parliament: The Australian Senate in Theory and Practice'', Department of the Senate, Canberra, 2003, pp 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, these recommendations may contribute to subsequent government policy announcements and occasionally to changes in government actions. The work of the regulations and ordinances committee has led to revisions of subordinate legislation in significant respects.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Smith, 'Parliament', in Judith Brett, James Gillespie and Murray Goot (eds), ''Developments in Australian Politics'', Macmillan, Melbourne, 1994, pp 126–129&lt;/ref&gt; Committee scrutiny of bills has contributed to them being amended&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, [http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/10/06/1757544.htm Senate committee urges changes to proposed media laws], 6 October 2006, retrieved September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; or withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200606/s1662531.htm 'Calls mount for Govt to drop migration bill'], 14 June 2006, retrieved September 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409090912/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200606/s1662531.htm |date=9 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of committees on legislation overall has however been described as 'rather limited',&lt;ref&gt;Graham Maddox, ''Australian Democracy in Theory and Practice'' (3rd edition), Longman, Melbourne, 1996, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as the committees that review bills are controlled by a government majority.

Senate committees can be affected by the party composition of the Senate. The [[Clerk of the Australian Senate|Clerk of the Senate]], Harry Evans, argued that a government majority of seats in the Senate resulted in limitations on what the committees inquired into, and how readily governments responded to their queries and requests for information.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, H. "The government majority in the Senate: A nail in the coffin of responsible government?", [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/evans/031006/031006.htm address to Victorian Chapter of the Australasian Study of Parliament Group], 3 October 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605002628/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/evans/031006/031006.htm |date=5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics published by centrist political party the Australian Democrats have been used to support the contention that committee operations have been inhibited by government control of the Senate, particularly in respect of selection of topics for committee inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Democrats, [http://www.democrats.org.au/campaigns/senate_watch/ ''Senate Watch''], retrieved September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922060103/http://www.democrats.org.au/campaigns/senate_watch/ |date=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However Senator Minchin, the leader of the government in the Senate in the mid-2000s, pointed out that their political rivals had previously [[Cloture|cut off]] debate on more bills in the Senate than had his government.&lt;ref&gt;Senator Nick Minchin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070829103245/http://www.financeminister.gov.au/media/2007/mr_502007.html 'Senate majority used responsibly'], media release, 26 June 2007, retrieved September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prominent Senate committee inquiries===
One of the most high-profile Senate committee inquiries was the Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident, which in 2002 investigated what became known as the [[Children Overboard Affair]]. The events and subsequent Senate committee inquiries were widely reported,&lt;ref&gt;See for example David Marr and Marian Wilkinson, ''Dark Victory'', Allen &amp; Unwin, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and the transcripts of the inquiry formed the basis of a play, ''A Certain Maritime Incident''.&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Nolan, [http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2004/s1074637.htm 'A Certain Maritime Incident: Pure Theatre'], ABC Radio, ''The World Today'', 26 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Other high-profile inquiries included the Community Affairs committee's inquiry into Children in Institutional Care{{dead link|date=September 2012}}, which brought to wide public notice the experiences of children who had been placed in care in sometimes inhumane circumstances and was directly responsible for state governments and churches making public apologies to the victims of abuse or neglect;&lt;ref&gt;Anglican Church Diocese of Sydney, [http://www.psu.anglican.asn.au/images/uploads/CARE_LEAVERS_RESPONSE.pdf ''Response to Care Leavers''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902080730/http://www.psu.anglican.asn.au/images/uploads/CARE_LEAVERS_RESPONSE.pdf |date=2 September 2007 }}, 25 October 2005, retrieved September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Minister for Children, Sherryl Garbutt, [http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/bc348d5912436a9cca256cfc0082d800/5c2159e2f617fc0fca2571b8008079db!OpenDocument 'Victoria to apologise to former children in state care'], ''Media Release'' 27 July 2006, retrieved September 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207025703/http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/bc348d5912436a9cca256cfc0082d800/5c2159e2f617fc0fca2571b8008079db!OpenDocument |date=7 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Select Committee on Mental Health{{dead link|date=September 2012}}, which contributed to widespread discussion of mental health issues and to a major funding boost for services in 2006;&lt;ref&gt;The Hon.

'''Autonomedia''' is based in Brooklyn, New York, and is one of the main [[North America]]n publishers of radical theoretical works, especially in the [[anarchist]] tradition. For many years, it was linked with [[Semiotext(e)]], a press that published English-language translations of [[post-structuralist]] literature, especially in the 1980s. 

According to [[Hakim Bey]], Semiotext(e) 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"was founded in 1974 by [[Sylvère Lotringer]], a French scholar working for [[Columbia University]] whose self-appointed task was to introduce the Paris of '68 philosophers to America. That would include [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]], [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], etc. And then, somewhere around 1982, Autonomedia become the umbrella book company."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyberpsychos.netonecom.net/cpaod6/6bey.html Bruce Young, "Hakim Bey: The T.A.Z. and You"], ''[[CyberPsychos AOD]]' #6, page 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In early 2001, however, the two presses split; Semiotext(e) became part of [[MIT Press]].

Autonomedia publishes books on a variety of topics, such as [[anarchism]], [[Autonomist Marxism|"autonomist"]] and extraparliamentary [[marxism]], [[cyberfeminism]], [[psychedelics]] and drug literature, turn of the 21st century [[queer]] individualist anarchist novels, etc. Well-known authors include [[Antonio Negri]], [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]], [[Michael Muhammad Knight]], [[Silvia Federici]], PM, [[John Moore (anarchist)|John Moore]], and others. They also are known for publishing the "Autonomedia Calendar of Jubilee Saints," in which every day of the [[calendar]] commemorates a deceased person of significance to [[Progressivism|progressive movements]] or thought, and also is a [[holiday]] of some sort.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4270">In [[economics]], the '''benefitive treasury measure''' ('''BTM''') is an [[economic indicator]] that attempts to correlate a relationship between immigration and government tax receipts/government spending; put more simply, it is cost-benefit analysis of [[immigration]] on a [[macroeconomic]] scale. Originally coined in a policy report by G. Ing and R. McGowan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.votelib.org VoteLib]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Liberal Democrat Policy Research Unit, it was later popularised by the [[BBC]]'s Business Editor, Robert Peston,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Peston ''Who Runs Britain? ...and who's to blame for the economic mess we're in''. 2008. {{ISBN|0-340-83944-9}}. pages 239–242 and 249&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[late-2000s recession]], in reference to the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s proposal for a cap on inwards migration, referred to as the "immigrant cap".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservatives.com/Policy/Where_we_stand/Immigration.aspx Conservative policy manifesto] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414152358/http://www.conservatives.com/Policy/Where_we_stand/Immigration.aspx |date=April 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

BTM analysis typically takes one of two forms. The first, growth analysis or 'absolute BTM', charts the net benefits and net costs of total inward migration occurring within the last 12 months (for example, increased welfare payments, tax receipts, and social unrest). 

The second form of BTM analysis, 'Schengen BTM', has its parametres limited to immigration originating from European Union member states. Schengen BTM is unique in that it as much a political tool as an economic one, having originated from the research unit of a British political party. 

The result of BTM analysis is displayed as BTM points, with each point corresponding to 0.01% of [[economic growth]], relative to [[real GDP]]; for example, 4 on the BTM scale would suggest annual [[economic growth]] of 0.04% ([[real terms]]) within an economy, directly resultant of the previous year's net immigration. -4, in contrast, would indicate a contraction of −0.04%, perhaps as a result of social disorder, falling productivity or some other cause.

These factors may be described as benefitive treasury indicators, the [[socio-economic]] factors used to predict and calculate the annual BTM. BTI ranges from additional [[key worker]] housing construction costs, increases in law and order expenditure (as a result of additional need for [[social cohesion]] initiatives in deprived areas), to rises in the level of [[social security]] outpayments.

== History ==
In 1985, the member states of the European Union ratified the [[Schengen Agreement]], a quasi-[[Treaties of the European Union|Treaty]] that abolished the vast majority of border controls within the so-called [[Schengen Area]]. This process enabled freedom of labour movement across the [[Schengen Zone]], in the spirit of furthering a [[Common Market]] and a free trade area. 

The long-term effects of the Schengen Agreement are not yet clear and are still subject to some debate, with British [[Eurosceptics]] pointing to "unprecedented" immigration figures as evidence of unintended consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5273356.stm 2006 BBC article]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 [[enlargement of the EU]] only fanned this debate; particularly-[[eurosceptic]] member states became even more concerned that they would not be able to weather the impacts of both increased immigration, and emigration, on their respective economies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/uk-faces-major-issues-over-eu-immigration-414075.html 2006 Independent article]&lt;/ref&gt; Benefitive treasury measure, to try to calm fears by correlating with growth patterns, was a response from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], the UK's primary integrationist party, who cooperated with EU researchers work on a preliminary assessment of the effect of the free movement of labour on each member state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/doc_centre/immigration/studies/docs/emn_immigration_2006_en.pdf Immigration impact, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1106">'''Bharat Stree Mahamandal''' ({{lang-bn|ভারত স্ত্রী মহামন্ডল}}) was the first women's organisation in [[India]] founded by [[Sarala Devi Chaudhurani]] in [[Allahabad]] in 1910. One of the primary goals of the organisation was to promote [[female education]], which at that time was not well developed. The organisation opened several offices in [[Lahore]] (then part of undivided India), Allahabad, [[Delhi]], [[Karachi]], [[Amritsar]], [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], [[Kanpur]], [[Bankura]], [[Hazaribagh]], [[Midnapur]] and [[Kolkata]] (formerly Calcutta) to improve the situation of women all over India.

==History==
===2005–2012: creation and early years===
[[File:Andrew Breitbart by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andrew Breitbart]] in 2012]]
Andrew Breitbart launched Breitbart.com as a news aggregator in 2005. The website featured direct links to wire stories at the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], [[Fox News]], the ''[[New York Post]]'', [[TMZ]] as well as a number of other outlets. The website's initial growth was largely fueled by links from the ''[[Drudge Report]]''. In 2007, Breitbart.com launched a video blog, Breitbart.tv.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rob Owen (journalist)|Owen, Rob]]. [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07075/769897-96.stm The next wave: Ex-WTAE anchor Scott Baker changes channel to run Web news site], ''[[Post-Gazette]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf-121101"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/breitbartcom-struggles-with-the-contradictions-of-its-namesake/264372/ | title=Breitbart.com Struggles With the Contradictions of Its Namesake | work=[[The Atlantic]] | date=November 1, 2012 | accessdate=January 4, 2015 | last=Friedersdorf|first= Conor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the site, the current incarnation of the website was conceived by Breitbart during a visit to [[Israel]] in mid-2007 as a website that would, in his own words, be "unapologetically pro-freedom and pro-Israel".&lt;ref name=SolovOrigins&gt;Solov, Larry (November 17, 2015).

Breitbart.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, Andrew Breitbart told the [[Associated Press]] that he was "committed to the destruction of the old media guard." As part of that commitment, he founded Breitbart.com, a website designed to become "the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' of the right" according to Breitbart News's former executive chairman, [[Steve Bannon]].&lt;ref name="Rainey_20120801" /&gt; Breitbart News exclusively re-posted the [[Anthony Weiner sexting scandal]], the [[resignation of Shirley Sherrod]], and the [[ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy]]. Following Andrew Breitbart's death in 2012, the site was redesigned, bringing the formerly distinct "Big" websites under one umbrella website at Breitbart.com.&lt;ref name="Rainey_20120801"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rainey|first1=James|title=Breitbart.com sets sights on ruling the conservative conversation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/01/entertainment/la-et-breitbart-20120801|accessdate=October 8, 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boyle|first1=Matthew|title=Breitbart legacy lives on in relaunched websites, final column|url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/05/breitbart-legacy-lives-on-in-relaunched-websites-final-column/|accessdate=October 8, 2015|publisher=The Daily Caller|date=March 5, 2012|quote=... newly redesigned website that includes all of his 'Big' sites under a single umbrella.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bannon assumes leadership====

Andrew Breitbart died in March 2012. The website hosted a number of memorials for him.

The company also hired [[Joel Pollak]] as editor-in-chief and [[Alex Marlow]] as managing editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/03/breitbart-to-announce-new-management-117836|title=Breitbart to announce new management|newspaper=Politico|accessdate=November 14, 2016|first=Keach|last=Hagey|date=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An October 2012 article in [[BuzzFeed]] suggested there were internal tensions in the organisation in the year after Andrew Breitbart's death as staffers battled for ownership of his legacy.&lt;ref name="ABLegacy"&gt;{{Cite web| url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/breitbarts-inheritors-battle-over-his-legacy#.dgaAW90Ng| title = Breitbart's Inheritors Battle Over His Legacy| last = Coppins| first = McKay| website = BuzzFeed| accessdate = March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his death, Andrew Breitbart had begun a redesign of the Breitbart News website to transform it from a links-aggregator into a more tabloid-style website. The redesign was launched shortly after his death in March 2012.&lt;ref name="ABLegacy" /&gt;

In February 2014, Bannon announced the addition of approximately 12 staff members and the opening of Texas and London-based operations. The new offices were the beginning of an expansion plan that included the addition of a new regional site roughly every 90 days, with new locations to include [[Florida]], [[California]], [[Cairo, Egypt|Cairo]], and [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/business/media/breitbart-news-network-plans-global-expansion.html|title=Breitbart News Network Plans Global Expansion|date=February 16, 2014|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 10, 2015|last=Kaufman|first= Leslie}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2014 [[Pew Research Center]] study, 3% of respondents got their news from Breitbart in a typical week, and 79% of its audience report having political values that are right-of-center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=October 21, 2014 |title=Where News Audiences Fit on the Political Spectrum: Consumers of Breitbart |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |url=http://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/breitbart/|accessdate=October 26, 2015 |quote=Just 3% of respondents get news from Breitbart in a typical week, and its audience is decidedly conservative: 79% have political values that are right-of-center..."

Breitbart News strongly supported [[Donald Trump]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016]].

====Big Journalism====
In January 2010, Andrew Breitbart launched Big Journalism. Upon the launch of Big Journalism, he told [[Mediaite]]: "Our goal at Big Journalism is to hold the mainstream media's feet to the fire. There are a lot of stories that they simply don't cover, either because it doesn't fit their world view, or because they're literally innocent of any knowledge that the story even exists, or because they are a dying organization, short-staffed, and thus can't cover stuff like they did before."&lt;ref name=exclusive/&gt; Big Journalism was edited by [[Michael Walsh (author)|Michael A.

===ACORN undercover videos===
Breitbart News played a central role in the [[ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy|2009 ACORN video controversy]], which resulted in the reorganization of the [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]], as well as its loss of private and government funding. Breitbart News contributor [[Hannah Giles]] posed as a prostitute fleeing an abusive [[pimp]] and seeking tax and legal advice on how to run an illegal business that included the use of underage girls in the sex trade, while [[James O'Keefe]], another contributor, posed as her boyfriend. They clandestinely videotaped meetings with [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]] staff who "gave advice on house-buying and how to account on tax forms for the woman's income."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate Votes to Cut Off ACORN Housing Funding|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/09/14/senate-votes-cut-acorn-housing-funding.html|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=September 14, 2009|access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CA AG Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1888_acorn_report.pdf|title=Report of the Attorney General on the Activities of ACORN|publisher=[[California Department of Justice]], [[California Attorney General|Office of the California Attorney General]]|date=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shirley Sherrod's remarks at NAACP fundraiser===
{{Main|Firing of Shirley Sherrod}}
In July 2010, Breitbart News released an edited video titled "Proof NAACP Awards Racism" which featured [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] official [[Shirley Sherrod]] speaking at a [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] fundraising dinner in March 2010. In the video, Sherrod admits to a racial reluctance to help a white farmer obtain government aid. As a result of the video, the NAACP condemned Sherrod's remarks, and U.S. government officials called on Sherrod to resign, which she did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gay Stolberg|first1=Sheryl|last2=Dewan|first2=Shaila|last3=Stelter|first3=Brian|title=With Apology, Fired Official Is Offered a New Job|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/us/politics/22sherrod.html|accessdate=March 15, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=snookered&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Tristan|last2=Adriano|first2=Joneil|last3=Malveaux|first3=Suzanne|title=NAACP 'snookered' over video of former USDA employee|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/07/20/agriculture.employee.naacp/|accessdate=March 15, 2016|publisher=CNN|date=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was investigating rumors that Hagel had been paid for speaking to "controversial organizations", and asked sarcastically whether he had addressed "Friends of Hamas." Friedman followed with an email to the congressional staffer asking if Hagel had received a $25,000 fee from "Friends of Hamas" for his speaking engagement. No reply to the email was received, and the next day, Breitbart News ran a story with the headline "Secret Hagel Donor?: White House Spox Ducks Question on 'Friends of Hamas'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Friedman| first = Dan| date = February 19, 2013| title = 'Friends of Hamas': My role in the birth of a rumor| publisher = [[New York Daily News]]| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/friends-hamas-rumor-started-article-1.1268284}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Taintor| first = David| date = February 20, 2013| title = NY Daily News Reporter: It Seems I Created 'Friends Of Hamas' Hagel Rumor| publisher = [[Talking Points Memo]]| url = http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/ny-daily-news-reporter-it-seems-i-created}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nancy Pelosi/Miley Cyrus ad campaign===
In April 2014, Breitbart News created an advertising campaign to launch ''Breitbart California'', which included posters bearing an image of House minority leader [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s head superimposed onto singer [[Miley Cyrus]]'s body as seen [[twerking]] on California governor [[Jerry Brown]], spoofing the 2013 [[MTV Video Music Award|VMAs]]. [[Democratic National Committee|DNC]] Chairwoman and Florida Congresswoman [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] denounced the images as disrespectful to women. In response, House Majority Whip [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] requested that his column be removed from the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/8/house-majority-whip-kevin-mccarthy-pulls-breitbart/|title=House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy pulls Breitbart column over twerking Nancy Pelosi pic|author=Jessica Chasmar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/democrats-breitbart-california-nancy-pelosi-105433.html|title=Democrats blast Breitbart Nancy Pelosi posters|author=Tal Kopan|website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2014/04/07/democrats-pelosi-breitbart-california-ads/|title=Democrats slam 'offensive' Pelosi image on Breitbart site|work=OnPolitics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/04/nancy-pelosi-says-breitbart-altered-pic-of-her-twerking-is-tasteless/|title=Nancy Pelosi Says Breitbart-Altered Pic of Her Twerking Is 'Tasteless'|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/dnc-blasts-disgusting-breitbart-california-pelosi-ad|title=Democrats: Breitbart Ad Depicting Nancy Pelosi As Miley Cyrus Is 'Disgusting' (Photo)|publisher=TalkingPointsMemo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/08/breitbart-twerks-pelosi-with-credibility-destroying-ad.html|title=Breitbart Twerks Pelosi With Credibility-Destroying Ad|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Breitbart News, the inspiration for the ad campaign was a 2013 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit in which Cyrus appeared as a highly sexualized version of Republican Congresswoman [[Michele Bachmann]] alongside a feminine, homosexual version of Republican Congressman and Speaker of the House [[John Boehner]].&lt;ref name="Breitbart News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/04/07/Wasserman-Schultz-Pelosi-Condemn-Tasteless-and-Undignified-Breitbart-California-Viral-Art|title=Pelosi, Wasserman Schultz Condemn 'Tasteless and Undignified' Breitbart California Viral Art|publisher=Breitbart News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misidentification of Loretta Lynch===
On November 8, 2014, Breitbart News posted an article by Warner Todd Huston, which erroneously reported that [[Loretta Lynch]], President Barack Obama's nominee for attorney general, had been part of [[Bill Clinton]]'s defense team during the [[Whitewater scandal]] about the [[Whitewater Development Corporation]]. In fact, the Whitewater lawyer was a different Loretta Lynch. After this mistake was pointed out by ''[[Talking Points Memo]]'' and [[Media Matters for America]], Breitbart News noted that the two Lynches were different people by correcting and appending the original article.&lt;ref name=WaPoLynch/&gt; Andrew Rosenthal of ''The New York Times'' editorial page editor criticized this, writing: "The appended correction didn't really do justice to the scope of the misidentification."&lt;ref name=NYTLynch&gt;[http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/no-comment-necessary-the-wrong-loretta-lynch/?_r=0 "No Comment Necessary: The Wrong Loretta Lynch"]. Rosenthal, Andrew. ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[American Journalism Review]]'' said "that Breitbart had let the mistaken fact stand in the headline and the article itself," and had published a second story containing the incorrect information on November 9. By November 10, the initial story had been deleted from Breitbart.com.&lt;ref name="WaPoLynch"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/10/breitbart-news-attacked-the-wrong-loretta-lynch/ Breitbart News attacked the wrong Loretta Lynch].

===Conspiracy theories about President Obama===
According to ''The New York Times'', Breitbart News promoted the [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|falsehood that President Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim]]&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/alt-right-salutes-donald-trump.html|title=Alt-Right Gathering Exults in Trump Election With Nazi-Era Salute|last=Goldstein|first=Joseph|date=November 21, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|quote=Mr. Bannon was the chief executive of Breitbart, an online news organization that has fed the lie that Mr. Obama is a Kenyan-born Muslim.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birtherism]]").

In June 2016, Breitbart News falsely claimed President Obama supported terrorists.&lt;ref name="FactCheck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JacobsonConspiracy" /&gt;

In March 2017, Breitbart News published a story by [[conservative talk radio]] host [[Mark Levin]] claiming that Obama had [[wiretap]]ped Donald Trump during [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump's 2016 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/us/politics/trump-twitter-talk-radio-conspiracy-theory.html|title=A Conspiracy Theory's Journey From Talk Radio to Trump's Twitter|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=March 5, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 6, 2017|last2=Haberman|first2=Maggie|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/03/05/trumps-evidence-for-obama-wiretap-claims-relies-on-sketchy-anonymously-sourced-reports/|title=Analysis {{!}} Trump's 'evidence' for Obama wiretap claims relies on sketchy, anonymously sourced reports|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Trump repeated the claims on his Twitter feed less than 24 hours after Breitbart News ran the story.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/us/politics/trump-obama-tap-phones.html|title=Trump, Offering No Evidence, Says Obama Tapped His Phones|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=March 4, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 6, 2017|last2=Schmidt|first2=Michael S.|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Breitbart News published an article by Dellingpole that claimed that 58 scientific papers disproved [[Global warming|anthropogenic climate change]].

===Wrongly picturing Lukas Podolski as a refugee===
In August 2017, Breitbart News featured a picture of professional German soccer player [[Lukas Podolski]] in an article entitled "Spanish Police Crack Gang Moving Migrants on Jet-Skis".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/breitbart-lukas-podolski-picture-migrant-jet-ski-donald-trump-steve-bannon-a7903531.html|title=Breitbart forced to apologise after mistaking Lukas Podolski for a migrant on a jet-ski|date=August 20, 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=August 20, 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/menschen/breitbart-blamiert-sich-mit-bild-von-podolski-15159977.html|title="Breitbart" blamiert sich: Lukas Podolski, ein Flüchtling aus Nordafrika?|date=August 20, 2017|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|access-date=August 20, 2017|language=de-DE|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/article167838977/Lukas-Podolski-mahnt-Breitbart-News-ab.html|title=Jetski-Foto: Lukas Podolski mahnt "Breitbart News" ab - WELT|website=DIE WELT|access-date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Podolski is neither a migrant gang member nor a victim of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The picture was of Podolski riding a jet-ski in the summer of 2014 in Brazil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Breitbart News apologized to Podolski after the picture drew attention.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===False story about Northern California wildfires===
In October 2017, Breitbart News published a false story claiming that an undocumented immigrant was arrested in connection with the [[October 2017 Northern California wildfires]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/briannasacks/no-an-undocumented-immigrant-did-not-start-the-deadly|title=Breitbart Made Up False Story That Immigrant Started Deadly Sonoma Wildfires, Sheriff's Office Says|last=Ansari|first=Brianna Sacks, Talal|website=BuzzFeed|access-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonoma County's sheriff department responded to Breitbart's reporting, "This is completely false, bad, wrong information that Breitbart started and is being put out into the public."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A '''building estimator''' or cost estimator is an individual that quantifies the [[Raw material|material]]s, [[manual labour|labor]], and equipment needed to complete a [[construction]] project.  Building cost estimating can concern diverse forms of construction from residential properties to hi-rise and civil works.   
Both estimators and quantity surveyors must have a background education in the construction industry. 
Representative [[professional bodies]] which regulate property professionals:
* Entry to membership of the [[Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors]] is via four main routes: [[academic]], [[graduate school|graduate]], [[Vocational education|technical]], and senior [[professional]] and has links with a number of universities worldwide, with whom they have accredited approved courses.
*The American Society of Professional Estimators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspenational.org|title=American Society of Professional Estimators|website=www.aspenational.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; - a non profit association which promotes [[construction]] estimating as a professional field of endeavor. Professional estimators use [[Construction Estimating Software]].
*The Consulting Estimator Forum is a non profit group which promotes professional [[construction]] [[bidding]] and estimating practices. Professional estimators use [[Construction Estimating Software]].

'''[[Fiji]]'s''' four '''[[coups]]''' in the past two decades have had '''church involvement'''. At the center of each coup lies the tension between the ethnic Fijians and [[Indians in Fiji|Indian Fijians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6209486.stm | work=BBC News | title=Background to Fiji's four coups | date=December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religion]] plays a significant role, as the majority of ethnic Fijians belong to the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church while the majority of Indian Fijians are [[Hinduism|Hindu]].

In each of the four coups, one of the sides sought to reduce rights for Indian Fijians, whereas the other side sought to grant equality to Indian Fijians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/830926.stm | work=BBC News | title=Future bleak for Fiji's Indians | date=July 12, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coup by Colonel [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] in 1987 led to a constitution that ensured Indian Fijians could only have less than half of all seats in parliament and banned Indians from the post of prime minister. The [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|coup of 2000]], by [[George Speight]], removed the elected Prime Minister [[Mahendra Chaudhry|Mahendra Chaudry]], who is a Hindu of Indian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/754876.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ethnic split haunts Fijian politics | date=May 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Methodist Church==
{{See|Military–church relations in Fiji}}

The powerful Methodist Church backed the past three coups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/tribal-chiefs-critical-of-coup/2006/12/07/1165081060811.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Tribal chiefs critical of coup | date=December 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has opposed the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|2006 coup]].

The Church plays a major role in Fiji politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=52499 Let us pray, churches say], Fiji Times Online, November 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, some politicians appeal to Fijians addressing them as "Christians", even though Hindus are 38% of the 
population in Fiji, compared with 52% Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1834.htm Fiji (10/07)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged by Commodore Frank Bainimarama that the [[2000 Fijian coup d'état]] that removed the elected PM [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], was supported by many people within Methodist church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?id=18901&amp;op=read |title=Fiji military dismisses GCC and Methodist support for reconciliation bill |date=August 25, 2005 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Methodist church leaders supported a subsequent proposal to pardon those involved.

There are some people within the Methodist church that have raised the possibility of declaring Fiji a theocratic Christian state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/link.asp?id=u250pmj6q7047403 Roots of Land and Church: the Christian State Debate in Fiji - International journal for the Study of the Christian Church&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has brought [[Frank Bainimarama|Josaia Voreqe "Frank" Bainimarama]], leader of the December 2006 coup, into conflict with the Methodist church in the past.

==Proposal to establish a Christian state in Fiji==

Some Methodist Church authorities have continued to advocate the establishment of a Christian state. In a letter of support from the head of the Methodist Church, Reverend Tomasi Kanilagi, to George Speight, the leader of the May 19, 2000, armed takeover of Parliament,  Reverend Kanilagi publicly expressed his intention to use the Methodist Church as a forum under which to unite all ethnic Fijian political parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/23828.htm Fiji&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Methodist church also supported forgiveness to those who plotted the coup in form of so-called "[[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill]]".

==Opposition to practice of Hinduism==

The Methodist church general secretary Reverend Ame Tugaue has expressed concern about the practice of Hinduism in Fiji. Fiji Times reported his views on March 27, 2005:

:"Because if God does get angry with the heathens, Christians will be punished because they allowed the worship of idols and other lesser gods in Fiji.  Sodom and Gomorrah were only destroyed after the Lord removed the faithful from there and not because of a few would we allow God's wrath to befall the whole of Fiji. It was clearly stated in the 10 Commandments that God gave to Moses that Christians were not allowed to worship any other gods and not to worship idols." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianaggression.org/item_display.php?type=NEWS&amp;id=1112408217 Christian Aggression&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926230135/http://www.christianaggression.org/item_display.php?type=NEWS&amp;id=1112408217 |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverend Tuikilakila Waqairatu of the Fiji Council of Churches and Assembly of Christian Churches has stated that the 2006 coup is "un-Christian" and is "[a] manifestation of darkness and evil" and pointed out that "52% of Fijians are Christian and the country's Christian values are being undermined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/latest/200612061204/fiji_military_monitoring_the_media |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118042641/http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/latest/200612061204/fiji_military_monitoring_the_media |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exodus of Indians from Fiji==

Fiji is one of the few countries in the world that officially imposes disabilities on a group that constitutes a large part of the population, on the basis of [[racism|race]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120728002920/http://www.cdnn.info/special-report/fiji_coup/fiji_coup.html 403 Forbidden&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/wire/may2001/index Amnesty International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230084057/http://web.amnesty.org/wire/may2001/index |date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[religion]]. It has caused an exodus of the Indians, who until recently formed slight majority in Fiji.&lt;ref&gt;[http://migration.ucdavis.edu/MN/more.php?id=2176_0_5_0 Migration News - Migration Dialogue&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906070438/http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=2176_0_5_0 |date=2006-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Civil Center for National Initiative''' is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] think-tank which aims to promote the role of [[civil society]] in Lebanese politics, as well as establish a civil and non-confessional state in Lebanon.

Created in 2008, its founding members include statesman [[Hussein el-Husseini]], former prime minister [[Najib Mikati]], journalist [[Ghassan Tueni]], poet [[Adunis]], among others,  which include members of parliament, university professors and journalists.

In 2009, following a long campaign, the Center succeeded in persuading the Lebanese Ministry of Interior to allow citizens to remove sectarian affiliation from civil records, a landmark in Lebanese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ID card petitions prompt religious reform|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/id-card-petitions-prompt-religious-reform|accessdate=27 September 2014|work=The National|date=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eco-capitalism''', also known as '''environmental capitalism''' or '''green capitalism''', is the view that [[capital (economics)|capital]] exists in nature as "[[natural capital]]" ([[ecosystem]]s that have [[ecological yield]]) on which all [[wealth]] depends, and therefore, [[Market (economics)|market-based]] government policy instruments (such as a [[carbon tax]]) should be used to resolve environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Eco-Capitalism|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/eco-capitalism|website=collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''Blue Greens'''" is often applied to those who espouse eco-capitalism. It is considered as the right-wing equivalent to [[Eco-socialism|Red Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The rise of green capitalism|url=http://roadtoparis.info/top-list/rise-green-capitalism/|website=roadtoparis.info|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The roots of eco-capitalism can be traced back to the late 1960s. The "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]", an essay published in 1968 in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' by [[Garrett Hardin]], claimed the inevitability of [[malthusian catastrophe]] due to liberal or democratic government's policies to leave family size matters to the family, and enabling the welfare state to willingly care for potential [[human overpopulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardin|first=Garrett|date=1968-12-13|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/162/3859/1243|journal=Science|language=en|volume=162|issue=3859|pages=1243–1248|doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17756331|bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin argued that if families were given freedom of choice in the matter, but were removed from a welfare state, parents choosing to overbear would not have the resources to provide for their "litter", thus solving the problem of overpopulation. This represents an early argument made from an eco-capitalist standpoint: overpopulation would technically be solved by a free market. [[John Baden]], a collaborator with Garrett Hardin on other works including ''Managing the Commons,'' founded the Political Economy Research Center (now called the [[Property and Environment Research Center]] ) in 1982. As one of the first eco-capitalist organizations created, PERC's ongoing mission is "improving environmental quality through property rights and markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perc.org/about-perc/percs-mission-vision|title=PERC's Mission &amp; Vision {{!}} PERC – The Property and Environment Research Center|website=www.perc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303130554/http://www.perc.org/about-perc/percs-mission-vision|archive-date=2017-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular eco-capitalist idea was [[emissions trading]], or more commonly, cap and trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/air/the-political-history-of-cap-and-trade-34711212/|title=The Political History of Cap and Trade|last=Conniff|first=Richard|date=August 2009|website=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emissions trading, a market-based approach that allows polluting entities to purchase or be allocated permits, began being researched in the late 1960s. International emissions trading was significantly popularized in the 1990s when the [[United Nations]] adopted the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~danov20d/site/history.htm|title=The Kyoto Protocol :: History|website=www.mtholyoke.edu|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Terry L. Anderson]] is a graduate of the University of Montana, and received his Ph.D from Washington University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perc.org/staff/terry-anderson|title=Terry Anderson {{!}} PERC – The Property and Environment Research Center|website=www.perc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson is currently serving as the co-chair of the Hoover Institution's Property Rights, Freedom and Prosperity task force. Anderson advocates that free markets can be both economically beneficial and environmentally protective. Anderson specializes in how markets impact Native American communities and their economies.
*[[Bruce Yandle]], a graduate of Mercer University, attended Georgia State University where he earned a MBA and PhD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercatus.org/bruce-yandle|title=Bruce Yandle|date=2008-08-15|work=Mercatus Center|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yandle is currently serving as dean emeritus of Clemson University's college of business. Yandle is prominent in the field of eco-capitalism for his story of the "Bootlegger and the Baptist". Yandle's theory of the Bootlegger and the Baptist posits that ethical groups, religious institutions and business captains can align their organizations in the interest of regulation and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Yandle]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry L.

Hawken's continued to make an impact on the business world by founding the research organization, Natural Capital Institute, and developed, [[Wiser.org|Wiser Earth]], a program focused on providing a platform for all to communicate about the environment. Not only has Paul Hawken set a good example for how to transform economy into eco-capitalism, but also has authored hundreds of publications, including four best selling books.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulhawken.com|title=paul hawken|website=www.paulhawken.com|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his writings, Hawken stresses that many smart ecological options are out there for businesses that will help save the environment, while also continuing to bring [[economic profit]]. One idea discussed in his book, ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution'', is the possibility of developing lightweight, electricity-powered cars as an alternative to our current transportation issue. Hawken attributes the hesitancy of adopting these options to lack of knowledge of these alternatives and high initial costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution|last=Hawken|first=Paul,|last2=Lovins|first2=Amory|last3=Lovins|first3=Hunter|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Hawken is now the head of OneSun, Inc., an energy corporation concentrated on low-cost solar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*[[Lester R. Brown|Lester Brown]] began his career as a tomato farmer in New Jersey, until earning his degree at Rutgers University and traveling to a rural India for a six-month study of the country's food and population crisis. From this point on, Brown's focus was mostly on finding alternatives that would solve the world’s population and resources problem. With financial support from [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]], Brown created the [[Worldwatch Institute]], the first dedicated to researching global environmental problems. In 2001, Brown found the [[Earth Policy Institute]], an organization that outlined a vision for creating an environmentally sustainable economy. Over the course of his career, Lester Brown has authored over 50 books and received 25 honorary degrees.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-policy.org/|title=Earth Policy Institute – Building a Sustainable Future {{!}} Home|website=www.earth-policy.org|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his publications, Brown discusses how the key to an eco-friendly economy is an honest market and replacing harmful aspects of the environment, like fossil fuels with renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/lester-brown|title=An interview with Lester Brown »  American Scientist|website=www.americanscientist.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2015, Lester Brown retired from Earth Policy and closed the institute.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Transition to eco-capitalism==
The ideology of eco-capitalism was adopted to satisfy two competing needs:
#the desire for generating profit by businesses in a capitalist society and
#the urgency for proper actions to address a struggling environment negatively impacted by human activity.
Under the doctrine of eco-capitalism, businesses commodify the act of addressing environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prothero|first1=Andrea|last2=Fitchett|first2=James|title=Greening Capitalism: Opportunities for a Green Commodity|journal=Journal of Macromarketing|date=June 2000|volume=20|issue=1|pages=46–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="god"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Richard|title=Green Capitalism: the god that failed|date=2015|publisher=World Economics Association|isbn=978-1-911156-22-2|pages=55–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are common principles in the transition to eco-capitalism.

=== Externalities: Correcting of a free market failure ===

A central part of eco-capitalism is to correct for the [[market failure]] seen in the externalization of [[pollution]]. By treating the issue of pollution as an [[externality]] it has allowed the market to minimize the degree of accountability. To correct for this market failure eco-capitalism would have to internalize this cost. A prime example of this shift towards internalizing externalities is seen in the adoption of a system for [[carbon trading]]. In a system like this people are forced to factor the pollution cost into their expenses.&lt;ref name=Zenghelis2015&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-923X.12239 |title=10. Decarbonisation: Innovation and the Economics of Climate Change |journal=The Political Quarterly |volume=86 |issue=S1 |pages=172–90 |year=2015 |last1=Zenghelis |first1=Dimitri }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system as well as other systems of internalization function on large and small scales(often times both are tightly connected). On a corporate scale, the government can regulate [[carbon emissions]] and other polluting factors in business practices forcing companies to either reduce their pollution levels, externalize these costs onto their consumers by raising the cost of their goods/services, and/or a combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1674446 |title=Pollution Externalities in a Schumpeterian Growth Model |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |year=2010 |last1=Koesler |first1=Simon }}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of systems can also be effective in indirectly creating a more environmentally conscious consumer base. As the companies who are creating the most pollution face falling profit levels and rising prices their consumers and investors are inclined to take their business elsewhere. This migration of investment and revenue would then be expected to make its way to business who have already incorporated the minimization of pollution into their business model thus allowing them to provide lower prices and higher profit margins attracting the migrating consumers and investors.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

===Green consumption===
{{further|Green consumption}}
At the conception of the ideology, major theorists of eco-capitalism, Paul Hawken, Lester Brown, and Francis Cairncross, saw an opportunity to establish a different approach to environmentalism in a capitalist society.&lt;ref name="god"/&gt; These theorists thought that not only producers but also consumers could shoulder the social responsibility of environmental restoration if "green technology, green taxes, green labeling, and eco-conscious shopping" existed.&lt;ref name="god"/&gt; The resulting "shopping our way to sustainability" mentality encouraged the development of organic farming, renewable energy, green certifications as well as other eco-friendly practices.&lt;ref name="god"/&gt;

A 2015 report from Nielsen lends credence to this theory. According to the report, consumers have more brand loyalty and are willing to pay higher prices for a product that is perceived as being sustainable. This is especially true among Millenials and Generation Z.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/green-generation-millennials-say-sustainability-is-a-shopping-priority.html|title=Green Generation: Millennials Say Sustainability Is a Shopping Priority|website=www.nielsen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These generations currently make up 48% of the global marketplace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2017/the-nielsen-total-audience-report-q1-2017.html|title=The Nielsen Total Audience Report: Q1 2017|website=www.nielsen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and still haven't hit their peak spending levels. As these generations' preferences continue to shape how businesses operate and market themselves, they could drive a continued shift toward green consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesinsights/2017/09/26/millennials-and-gen-z-are-the-new-bosses-of-the-boardroom/#7e3e1e7e67f4|title=Millennials And Gen Z Are The New Bosses Of The Boardroom|first=Stuart R.|last=Levine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the Annual Review of Environmental Resources, "the focus of policy makers, businesses, and researchers has mostly been on the latter (consuming differently), with relatively little attention paid to consuming less".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-032609-094328 |title=Green Consumption: Behavior and Norms |journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources |volume=35 |page=195 |year=2010 |last1=Peattie |first1=Ken }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of how to encourage sustainable consumption from the University of Surrey shows that, "Government policies send important signals to consumers about institutional goals
and national priorities."&lt;ref name="sustainablelifestyles.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainablelifestyles.ac.uk/sites/default/files/motivating_sc_final.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Motivating SC final.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments can pull a variety of levers to signal this including product, trading, building, media, and marketing standards.&lt;ref name="sustainablelifestyles.ac.uk"/&gt;

===Carbon trading===
{{further|Carbon trading}}
Creating perhaps the first major eco-capitalist endorsement, many political and economic institutions support a system of pollution credits. Such a system, which assigns property rights to emissions, is considered to be the most "efficient and effective" way for regulating [[greenhouse gas emissions]] in the current [[neoliberal]] global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bailey |first1=Ian |title=Neoliberalism, climate governance and the scalar politics of EU emissions trading |journal=Royal Geographical Society |date=2007 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=431–42 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4762.2007.00770.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the case of tradable pollution credits, the resulting market-based system of emissions regulation is believed to motivate businesses to invest in technology that reduce greenhouse gas emissions using [[positive reinforcement]] (i.e. ability to trade unused credits) and [[punishment]] (i.e. the need to buy more credits).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prudham |first1=Scott |title=Pimping climate change: Richard Branson, global warming, and the performance of green capitalism |journal=Environment and Planning |date=2009 |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=1594–613 |doi=10.1068/a4071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Full cost accounting===
[[Environmental full-cost accounting]] explains corporate actions on the basis of the triple bottom line, which is best summarized as "people, planet, and profit". As a concept of corporate social responsibility, full cost accounting not only considers social and economic costs and benefits but also the environmental implications of specific corporate actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffiths|first1=M.R|last2=Lucas|first2=J.R.|title=Value economics: the ethical implications of value for new economic thinking|date=November 16, 2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-137-54186-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Full Cost Accounting.jpg|thumb|A breakdown of accounting methodologies by what they include.]]

While there has been progress in measuring the cost of harm to the health of individuals and the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/how-to-measure-the-environmental|title=How to measure environmental pressures from production and consumption?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the interaction of environmental, social, and health effects makes measurement difficult. Measurement attempts can be broadly categorized as either behavioral in nature, like [[hedonic pricing]], or dose-response which looks at indirect effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.06.040 |title=A comprehensive review of full cost accounting methods and their applicability to the automotive industry |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=108 |page=1123 |year=2015 |last1=Jasinski |first1=Dominik |last2=Meredith |first2=James |last3=Kirwan |first3=Kerry }}&lt;/ref&gt; A standardized measurement of these costs has yet to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/sustainability/full-cost-accounting/en/|title=Sustainability Pathways: Full-cost accounting|website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with the full-cost method used by organizations searching for oil and gas that "does not differentiate between operating expenses associated with successful and unsuccessful exploration projects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/full-cost-method.asp|title=Full-Cost Method|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=14 May 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genuine progress indicator===
The current standard of using the gross domestic product (GDP) as an indicator of welfare is criticized for being inaccurate. An alternative to GDP, the [[genuine progress indicator]] compensates for the shortcomings of the GDP as a welfare indicator by accounting for environmental harms as well as other factors that affect consumption, such as crime and income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Talberth |first1=John |last2=Cobb |first2=Clifford |last3=Slattery |first3=Noah |title=The Genuine Progress Indicator 2006: A Tool for Sustainable Development |journal=Redefining Progress |date=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Majority of the criticism from traditionally unregulated [[capitalism]] is due to eco-capitalism's increased regulation. Pollution credits (as a means for regulating greenhouse gas emissions) is traditionally at odds with economically conservative ideologies. Elements of unregulated capitalism prefer environmental issues to be addressed by individuals who may allocate their own income and wealth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meltzher |first=Alan H. |year= |title=Why Capitalism?|url=http://wpweb2.tepper.cmu.edu/facultyadmin/upload/url4_933269885961_why_capitalism.pdf |journal=Carnegie Mellon University and American Enterprise Institute |volume= |page=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305224131/http://wpweb2.tepper.cmu.edu/facultyadmin/upload/url4_933269885961_Why_Capitalism.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; oppose the [[commodification]] of by-products like carbon emissions, and emphasize positive incentives to maintain resources through free-market competition and entrepreneurship.

Proponents of eco-capitalism view environmental reform like pollution credits as a more transformative and progressive system. According to these Proponents, since free market capitalism as inherently expansionist in tendency, ignoring environmental responsibility is a danger to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/26/capitalism-environment-green-greed-slow-life-symposium-tony-juniper|title=Capitalism v environment: can greed ever be green?|website=theguardian.com|last1=Juniper|first1=Tony|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 36% of Americans are deeply concerned about climate issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/04/the-politics-of-climate/|title=The Politics of Climate|date=4 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of Eco Capitalism typically favor political [[environmentalism]], which emphasizes negative incentives like regulation and taxes to encourage the conservation of resources and prevent environmental harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newpol.org/content/myths-%E2%80%9Cgreen-capitalism%E2%80%9D |title=The Myths of 'Green Capitalism' |first=Brian |last=Tokar |date=Winter 2014 |access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political theorist, [[Antonio Gramsci]], cites theories of [[common sense]], which suggests that, in general, free market capitalism absent of environmental reform, is ingrained in the minds of its members as the only viable and successful form of economic organization through [[cultural hegemony]]. Therefore, the proposal of any alternate economic system, like eco-capitalism, must overcome the predominant common sense and economic status quo in order to develop opposing theories. Nonetheless, movements in the United States and abroad have continued to push for reforms to protect the environment in current capitalistic systems.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Another political theorist, Daniel Tanuro, explains, in his book "Green Capitalism: Why it Can't Work", that for green capitalism to be successful, it would have to replace current mainstream capitalism with Eco-socialist methods, while defying corporate interests:
* “If by ‘green capitalism’ we understand a system in which the qualitative, social and ecological parameters are taken in account by the numerous competing capitals, that is to say even within economic activity as an endogenous mechanism, then we are completely deluded. In fact, we would be talking about a form of capitalism in which the law of value was no longer in operation, which is a contradiction in terms”(112)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green Capitalism: Why it Can't Work|last=Tanuro|first=Daniel|publisher=Merlin Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-55266-668-5|location=|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Tanuro adds that social and economical change to the current capitalist systems is necessary, because technology will invariably increase emissions as manufacturing processes and distribution systems progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green Capitalism: Why it Can't Work|last=Tanuro|first=Daniel|publisher=Merlin Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-55266-668-5|location=|pages=}}{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanuro argues for changes in three areas: 
# Use of transportation methods
# [[Agriculture]] and dietary changes
# Overall [[consumer]] lifestyle and market spending
Despite this argument, critics still claim that green consumption, sustainable behavior on the part of the consumer, is not enough to be instituted as a socio-environmental solution. In accordance with [[hegemony]], capitalism agrees that the government has little control over market and buyers, sellers, and consumers ultimately drive the market. In contrast, in green capitalism, the government would have more control therefore; consumers do not have direct power over the market, and should not be held accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S1414-49802012000100010 |title='Consumo consciente': O ecocapitalismo como ideologia |trans-title='Conscious Consumption': Ecocapitalism as Ideology |language=pt |journal=Revista Katálysis |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=95–111 |year=2012 |last1=Silva |first1=Maria das Graças e |last2=Araújo |first2=Nailsa Maria Souza |last3=Santos |first3=Josiane Soares }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, going against the established monetary system of capitalism in the U.S. and spread throughout the globally.

Environmental Scholar Bill McKibben proposes "full scale climate mobilization" to address environmental decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/135684/declare-war-climate-change-mobilize-wwii|title=We Need to Literally Declare War on Climate Change|date=2016-08-15|website=New Republic|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, vehicle manufacturers and general goods manufacturers shifted to producing weapons, military vehicles and war time goods. McKibben argues that, to combat environmental change, the American Military Industrial Complex and other national arms producers could shift to producing solar panels, wind turbines and other environmental products in an Eco-Capitalist system.

Scholar Elliot Sperber counters McKibben's argument, citing that industrial environmental mobilization favoring eco-capitalism would exacerbate socioeconomic stratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/08/22/clean-green-class-war-bill-mckibbens-shortsighted-war-on-climate-change/|title=Clean, Green, Class War: Bill McKibben’s Shortsighted ‘War on Climate Change’|date=2016-08-22|website=www.counterpunch.org|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sperber counters the notion that "full scale climate mobilization" and the production it implies is the best immediate solution for addressing climate change. Because Eco Capitalism is still capitalistic, it relies on production of goods. Sperber argues for the production of fewer goods (i.e. fewer plastics, fewer vehicles) to minimize carbon footprints.

Apparent criticisms have risen concerns and need for social and economical transformation on both ends of the political and theoretical divide. Nonetheless, they have shaped the way the majority public has viewed and contributed to capitalism and continue to both actively change the innate structure of the economic system and enhance it for further economic stability.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

== Appeal of renewable energy in the capitalist market ==
Tom Randall, a correspondent specializing in renewable energy for Bloomberg, calls to attention that wind and solar (energy sources) are "outperforming" [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/wind-and-solar-are-crushing-fossil-fuels|title=Wind and Solar Are Crushing Fossil Fuels|date=2016-04-06|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of investments, clean energy outperforms both gas and coal by a 2-1 margin. This positive margin may be attributed to the consistently falling price of renewable energy production. [[Renewable energy|Renewable energy sources]] hold assertive advantages over fossil fuels because they exist as technologies, not fuels. As time proceeds, renewable energy becomes inevitably more efficient as technology adapts. Technologies for extracting fuels may change, but the fuels remain as constants. Both the solar and wind industries have proven growth over time: Over the last 15 years, the solar industry has doubled seven times and the wind industry has doubled four times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, the fossil fuel industry has declined over the last 15 years. America's coal industry has lost 75 percent of its value within the past few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontracker.org/fossil-fuels-are-dead-the-rest-is-just-detail/|title=Fossil fuels are dead – the rest is just detail|website=www.carbontracker.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy sources also gain advantages over the fossil fuel industry through [[Paris Agreement|international governmental support]]. Globally, governments implement subsidies to boost the [[renewable energy industry]]. Concurrently, various global efforts fight against fossil fuel production and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnsjournal.org/green-capitalism-builds-big-solar-should-we-throw-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater/|title="Green" Capitalism builds Big Solar: Should we throw the baby out with the bathwater?|date=2016-04-10|work=CNS web|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for renewable energy sources has skyrocketed in the last 15 years, while fossil fuels have drastically fallen in demand (in capitalist societies).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/wind-and-solar-are-crushing-fossil-fuels|title=Wind and Solar Are Crushing Fossil Fuels|date=2016-04-06|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The worldwide concern of [[climate change]] (also known as [[global warming]]) is notably the largest contributor to the [[Sustainable energy|green energy]] industry's rapid acceleration, just as it is largely responsible for the decline of the [[fossil fuel industry]]. The overwhelming scientific consensus of climate change's reality and its potential catastrophic effects have caused a large part of the world's population to respond with panic and immediate action. While the world's response has been strong, environmentalists and climate scientists do not believe the response has been strong enough to counter climate change's effects, and that the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is moving far too slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnsjournal.org/green-capitalism-builds-big-solar-should-we-throw-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater/|title="Green" Capitalism builds Big Solar: Should we throw the baby out with the bathwater?|date=2016-04-10|work=CNS web|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global efforts and concerns of both governments and individuals to take action regarding implementing and transforming a society's energy sources from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources show the enormous potential of the green energy market. This potential is seen in the countless renewable energy projects under way. Currently, there are over [https://web.archive.org/web/20170301182310/http://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/resources/MajorProjectsList_20160914_0.pdf 4,000 major solar projects] being implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seia.org/research-resources/major-solar-projects-list|title=Major Solar Projects List|website=SEIA|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These, and all renewable energy projects, set goals of long-term economic benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-energy/renewable-energy/public-benefits-of-renewable-power#.WLX9nxC2CuV|title=Benefits of Renewable Energy Use|work=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Global Apollo Programme]], set up by both economists and scientists, has a goal of creating a solar capability that can stand as a cheaper alternative to coal-fueled power plants by 2025.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/06/economist-explains-1|title=How renewable energy can become competitive|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Capitalism|capitalist markets]], solar energy has the very real potential of becoming a direct competitor to coal plants in less than a decade.

=== Barriers to transition ===

While there can be many barriers to the transition to a eco-capitalist system, one of the most daunting and forgotten is the systemic barrier that can be created by former models. Dimitri Zenghelis explores the idea of path dependence and the how continuing to build infrastructure without foresight seriously impedes the implementation and benefits of future innovations.&lt;ref name=Zenghelis2015/&gt; Zenghelis uses the term “locked-in” to describe situations where the full implementation of a new innovation cannot be seen because an earlier infrastructure prevents it from functioning well. This barrier is exemplified in older cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York where the infrastructure was designed around urban sprawl to accommodate private vehicles. The sprawl has been researched with the results returning that the moving forward mega-cities need to be constructed as eco-cities if the hope of curving emission levels down is going to have any hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2013.09.003 |title=Incentives for China's urban mayors to mitigate pollution externalities: The role of the central government and public environmentalism |journal=Regional Science and Urban Economics |volume=47 |page=61 |year=2014 |last1=Zheng |first1=Siqi |last2=Kahn |first2=Matthew E |last3=Sun |first3=Weizeng |last4=Luo |first4=Danglun }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erythritol''' ('''(2''R'',3''S'')-butane-1,2,3,4-tetrol''') is a [[sugar alcohol]] (or [[polyol]]) that has been approved for use as a food additive in the [[United States]]&lt;ref name="cfsan.fda.gov"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/GenerallyRecognizedasSafeGRAS/GRASListings/ucm154185.htm FDA/CFSAN: Agency Response Letter: GRAS Notice No. GRN 000076&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout much of the world.  It was discovered in 1848 by Scottish chemist [[John Stenhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;The discovery of erythritol, which Stenhouse called "erythroglucin", was announced in: {{ cite journal | author = Stenhouse, J. | title = Examination of the proximate principles of some of the lichens | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 138 | pages = 63–89; see especially p. 76 | date = January 1, 1848 | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1848.0004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Erythritol was first isolated in 1852, but didn't become commercialized as a sugar alcohol until the 1990s in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Boesten, D.M.P.H.J.| author2=den Hartog, G.J.M. | author3=de Cock, P. | title=Health effects of erythritol | journal=Nutrafoods | volume=14 | issue=3 | date=2015 | doi=10.1007/s13749-014-0067-5 | doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It occurs naturally in some fruit and fermented foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shindou, T. |author2=Sasaki, Y. |author3=Miki, H. |author4=Eguchi, T. |author5=Hagiwara, K. |author6=Ichikawa, T. | title = Determination of erythritol in fermented foods by high performance liquid chromatography | journal = Shokuhin Eiseigaku Zasshi | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 419–22 | year = 1988 | doi = 10.3358/shokueishi.29.419 | url =https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/shokueishi1960/29/6/29_6_419/_pdf | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the industrial level, it is produced from glucose by fermentation with a [[yeast]], ''[[Moniliella]] pollinis''.&lt;ref name="cfsan.fda.gov"/&gt; Erythritol is 60–70% as sweet as sucrose (table sugar) yet it is almost noncaloric,&lt;ref name="Vasudevan2013"&gt;{{cite book | last=Vasudevan | first=D.

Under U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) labeling requirements, it has a caloric value of 0.2 kilo[[calorie]]s per gram (95% less than sugar and other carbohydrates), though nutritional labeling varies from country to country.  Some countries, such as [[Japan]] and the [[United States]], label it as zero-[[calorie]]; the [[European Union]] labels it 0 kcal/g.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:285:0009:0012:EN:PDF European Commission Directive 2008/100/EC] changed the energy conversion values of erythritol to zero calories:
:Erythritol is a polyol, and according to the current rules as provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 90/496/EEC, its energy would be calculated using the conversion factor for polyols, namely 10 kJ/g (2,4 kcal/g). Using this energy conversion factor would not fully inform the consumer about the reduced energy value of a product achieved by the use of erythritol in its manufacture. The Scientific Committee on Food in its opinion on erythritol, expressed on March 5, 2003, noted that the energy provided by erythritol was less than 0,9 kJ/g (less than 0,2 kcal/g). Therefore it is appropriate to adopt a suitable energy conversion factor for erythritol. Current regulations (Reg. (EC) 1169/2011) preserve this conversion factor at 0 kcal/g for energy value calculation purposes.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human digestion==
In the body, most erythritol is absorbed into the bloodstream in the [[small intestine]], and then for the most part excreted unchanged in the [[urine]]. About 10% enters the colon.&lt;ref name="Arrigoni-2005"/&gt; Because 90% of erythritol is absorbed before it enters the [[large intestine]], it does not normally cause [[laxative]] effects, as are often experienced after consumption of other sugar alcohols (such as [[xylitol]] and [[maltitol]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Munro, I.

==Side effects==
The known side effects for the regular use of erythritol are [[Stomach rumble|stomach rumbling]], nausea, and diarrhea in higher doses (over {{convert|50|g|oz}}).&lt;ref name="Storey-2007" /&gt; Rarely, erythritol can cause allergic hives ([[urticaria]]).&lt;ref name="Hino-2000"&gt;{{ cite journal | last1 = Hino | first1 = H. | last2 = Kasai | first2 = S. | last3 = Hattori | first3 = N. | last4 = Kenjo | first4 = K. | title = A case of allergic urticaria caused by erythritol | journal = Journal of Dermatology | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 163–5 | date = Mar 2000 | pmid = 10774141 | url = http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/10016271926/en/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When compared with other sugar alcohols, it is also much more difficult for intestinal bacteria to digest, so it is less likely to cause gas or bloating than other polyols,&lt;ref name="Arrigoni-2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Arrigoni, E. | author2=Brouns, F. | author3=Amadò, R. | title = Human gut microbiota does not ferment erythritol | journal = British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 94 | issue = 5 | pages = 643–6 | date = November 2005 | doi = 10.1079/BJN20051546 | pmid = 16277764 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=924276&amp;jid=BJN&amp;volumeId=94&amp;issueId=05&amp;aid=924264&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession= | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[maltitol]], [[sorbitol]], or [[lactitol]]. Erythritol absorption is not affected by glucose levels, and therefore has great potential to be an effective substitute for sugar in diabetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Boesten, D.M.P.H.J.| author2=den Hartog, G.J.M. | author3=de Cock, P. | title=Health effects of erythritol | journal=Nutrafoods | volume=14 | issue=3 | date=2015 | doi=10.1007/s13749-014-0067-5 | doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2014 study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Baudier, K.M.| author2=Kaschock-Marenda, S.D. | author3=Patel, N. | author4=Diangelus, K.L. | author5=O'Donnell, S.| author6=Marenda, D.R. | title=Erythritol, a Non-Nutritive Sugar Alcohol Sweetener and the Main Component of Truvia&amp;reg;, Is a Palatable Ingested Insecticide | journal=PLoS ONE | volume=9 | issue=6  |pages=e98949 | date=2014 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0098949 | doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; erythritol functions as an insecticide toxic to the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', impairing motor ability and reducing longevity even when nutritive sugars were available.

==Production==
Erythritol is produced industrially beginning with enzymatic [[hydrolysis]] of the starch from corn to generate [[glucose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.decodedscience.org/erythritol-made-manufacture-low-calorie-sugar-substitute/42248 | publisher = Decoded Science | title = How Is Erythritol Made? Manufacture of a Low-Calorie Sugar Substitute | date = January 28, 2014 | author = Clara Piccirillo, PhD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glucose is then fermented with yeast or another fungus to produce erythritol.  Other methods such as electrochemical synthesis are in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Suppliers2/Green-electrochemistry-could-pave-way-for-more-cost-effective-production-of-erythritol-says-trailblazing-DFI-Corp | title = ‘Green electrochemistry’ could pave way for more cost effective production of erythritol, says trailblazing DFI Corp | author = Elaine Watson | date = April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A genetically engineered mutant form of Yarrowia lipolytica, a yeast, has been optimized for erythritol production by fermentation, using glycerol as a carbon source and high osmotic pressure to increase yields up to 62%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fickers | first1 = P.| author1-link = P.

==Physical properties==

===Heat of solution===
Erythritol has a strong cooling effect ([[endothermic]], or positive [[heat of solution]])&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = Wohlfarth, C. | title = CRC handbook of enthalpy data of polymer-solvent systems | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e2XyFi-bMY8C&amp;pg=PA3 | year = 2006 | publisher = CRC / Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn = 978-0-8493-9361-7 | pages = 3– }}&lt;/ref&gt; when it dissolves in water, which is often compared with the cooling effect of [[Mentha|mint]] flavors. The cooling effect is present only when erythritol is not already dissolved in water, a situation that might be experienced in an erythritol-sweetened frosting, chocolate bar, chewing gum, or hard candy. The cooling effect of erythritol is very similar to that of [[xylitol]] and among the strongest cooling effects of all sugar alcohols.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Jasra, R. V. |author2=Ahluwalia, J. C. | title = Enthalpies of Solution, Partial Molal Heat Capacities and Apparent Molal Volumes of Sugars and Polyols in Water | journal = Journal of Solution Chemistry | year = 1982 | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 325–338 | doi = 10.1007/BF00649291 | issn = 1572-8927 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00649291#page-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Erythritol has a pKa of 13.903 at 18˚C.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=O'Neil, M. J. | title = Erythritol | journal = The Merck Index - An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs, and Biologicals. | year = 2006 | page = 629 | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blending for sugar-like properties===
Erythritol is commonly used as a medium in which to deliver high-intensity sweeteners, especially [[stevia]] derivatives, serving the dual function of providing both bulk and a flavor similar to that of table sugar. Diet beverages are made with this blend, thus contain erythritol in addition to the main sweetener. Beyond high-intensity sweeteners, erythritol is often paired with other bulky ingredients that exhibit sugar-like characteristics to better mimic the texture and mouthfeel of [[sucrose]]. The cooling effect of erythritol is rarely desired, hence other ingredients are chosen to dilute or negate that effect. Erythritol also has a propensity to crystallize and is not as soluble as sucrose, so ingredients may also be chosen to help negate this disadvantage. Furthermore, erythritol is not [[hygroscopic]], meaning it does not attract moisture, which can lead to the drying out of products, in particular baked goods, if another hygroscopic ingredient is not used in the formulation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Inulin]] is often combined with erythritol because of inulin's offering a complementary negative [[heat of solution]] ([[exothermic]], or warming effect when dissolved, which helps cancel erythritol's cooling effect) and noncrystallizing properties. However, [[inulin]] has a propensity to cause gas and bloating in those having consumed it in moderate to large quantities, in particular in individuals unaccustomed to it. Other sugar alcohols are sometimes used with erythritol, in particular [[isomalt]], because of its minimally positive heat of solution, and [[glycerin]], which has a negative heat of solution, moderate hygroscopicity, and noncrystallizing liquid form.

==Bacteria==
Erythritol is [[tooth-friendly]]; it cannot be [[metabolism|metabolized]] by oral [[bacteria]], so it does not contribute to [[Dental caries|tooth decay]].&lt;ref name="Kawanabe April 1994" /&gt;

Erythritol is preferentially used by the [[Brucella|''Brucella'' bacteria spp]]. The presence of erythritol in the placentas of goats, cattle, and pigs has been proposed as an explanation for the accumulation of ''Brucella'' bacteria found at these sites.&lt;ref name="PetersenRajashekara2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petersen|first1=Erik|last2=Rajashekara|first2=Gireesh|last3=Sanakkayala|first3=Neelima|last4=Eskra|first4=Linda|last5=Harms|first5=Jerome|last6=Splitter|first6=Gary|title=Erythritol triggers expression of virulence traits in Brucella melitensis|journal=Microbes and Infection|volume=15|issue=6–7|year=2013|pages=440–449|issn=1286-4579|doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2013.02.002|pmc=3686989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synonyms==
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, several synonyms were in use for erythritol: erythrol, erythrite, erythoglucin, eryglucin, erythromannite and phycite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Anaytical and Applied Chemistry|title=A list of words whose use should be avoided in favor of the accompanying synonyms|volume=6|page=160|year=1892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RogMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zerose is a [[tradename]] for erythritol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cargill unveils new products featuring Zerose natural sweetener |url=https://www.newhope.com/sweeteners/cargill-unveils-new-products-featuring-zerose-natural-sweetener |publisher=New Hope Network |accessdate=13 November 2018 |date=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frances Freeborn Pauley''' (1905-2003) was a southern [[civil rights activist]] in Georgia, who battled against racial injustice and discrimination throughout her life. Due to her actions in the civil rights movement, she led to the eventual desegregation and integration of African Americans in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tal|first=Kali|year=2002|title=Biographies of Frances Freeborn Pauley and Fannie Lou Hamer|url=|journal=Feminist Collections|volume=23.3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Pauley was born on September 11, 1905, in [[Wadsworth, Ohio|Wadsworth Ohio]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/pauley659/|title=Frances Freeborn Pauley papers, 1919-1992|last=1905-2003.|first=Pauley, Frances Freeborn,|date=2006-11-10|website=findingaids.library.emory.edu|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born to William Freeborn and Josephine Andrews Freeborn. Pauley's only sibling was her brother William Elbridge Freeborn. In 1908 at the age of three, Pauley moved with her family to [[Decatur, Georgia]] in [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]]. Pauley attended [[Decatur High School (Georgia)|Decatur High School]] for her primary education, following onto [[Agnes Scott College]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTGlAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=frances+freeborn+pauley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwr4jV34zQAhVFy1QKHQu4BKkQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=frances%20freeborn%20pauley&amp;f=false|title=Georgia Women: Their Lives and Times Volume 2|first=Kathryn L. |last=Nasstrom |chapter=Frances Freeborn Pauley (1905-2003) : Working for Justice in Twentieth-Century Georgia |pp=212–235 |editor1-last=Chirhart|editor1-first=Ann Short|editor2-last=Clark|editor2-first=Kathleen Ann|year=2014|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|isbn=9780820337845|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pauley graduated in 1927 with a degree of Mathematics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At that time, due to the upbringing in both the Mid-west and the South, Pauley adopted a dual identity growing up.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/frances-pauley-1905-2003|title=Frances Pauley (1905-2003)|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
Pauley began to work in public service during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She formed a church group with other women that worked to provide food and services to the impoverished citizens of [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her organization raised money to provide lunches to all students in public schools in the county. Pauley continued to work to provide services for those that did not have access to basic care, setting up a medical clinic in Decatur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pauley was a prominent voice in her community in advocating for racial integration. As president of the [[League of Women Voters]] she repealed bylaws that restricted membership to only white women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Pauley gathered support from other politicians and activists in the area, including [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and became the executive director of the [[Georgia Council on Human Relations|Georgia Council on Human relations]] in 1960 where she continued to work for further integration of schools and began to advocate for community organizations that encouraged participation and cooperation between citizens of differing races.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Pauley was then appointed to the [[U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] in 1968 where she worked and advocated for the continued desegregation and protection of schools in Georgia and across the country. Pauley served in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare until 1973 when officially retired.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
Throughout her activism career, Pauley held many positions which resulted in her having a crucial role in the civil rights movement. These positions include: President of the DeKalb County League of Women Voters, President of the Georgia chapter of the [[League of Women Voters]], Head of [[Georgia Council on Human Relations]],  and working as an administrator in Office of Civil Rights of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7U2tk4xO8tEC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=frances+freeborn+pauley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwr4jV34zQAhVFy1QKHQu4BKkQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=frances%20freeborn%20pauley&amp;f=false |title=Everybody's Grandmother and Nobody's Fool: Frances Freeborn Pauley and the Struggle for Social Justice |last=Nasstrom |first=Kathryn L. |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0801437822 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The culmination of these positions resulted in Frances Freeborn Pauley cementing her legacy as an influential individual in the southern civil rights moment.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2003|title=Civil-rights activist Frances Freeborn Pauley dies at age 97|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/430201562?pq-origsite=summon|journal=ProQuest|volume=|pages=|via=Philadelphia Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In every position which she held, Pauley attempted to promote equality and actively attempted to integrate African Americans into the structure of the institution. She was posthumously inducted into the [[Georgia Women of Achievement]] in 2015.

== Personal life ==
After Graduation from [[Agnes Scott College]] in 1927 with a degree in mathematics,  Pauley proceeded to assist in theatrical productions throughout [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] as well as [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whilst directing a play at St. Philip's Episcopal Church, Frances Freeborn Pauley met a landscape architect by the name of William Crooks Pauley. This encounter resulted in their eventual marriage on May 25, 1930. Frances and William Pauley remained married throughout the extent of their lives and served as the parents to two daughters, Joan Pauley Lamb, and Marylin Pauley Beittel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/pauley659/|title=Frances Freeborn Pauley papers, 1919-1992|last=1905-2003.|first=Pauley, Frances Freeborn,|date=2006-11-10|website=findingaids.library.emory.edu|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Home safety''' refers to the awareness and education of risks and potential dangers in and around a home which may cause bodily harm, injury, or even death to those residing in and around the physical structure of a home. It includes mitigating or preventing the unwanted dangers through testing, research and accepted standards of applications and practices.

==Most common risks==

===Mold===
Molds &lt;ref&gt;[http://iaq.supportportal.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=23007 US Environmental Protection Agency -  Indoor Air Quality]&lt;/ref&gt; are microscopic organisms that thrive in damp environments. They can be found on tiles and fabric, in bathrooms and kitchens, nearly any damp, warm place. [[Mold]]s are usually not a problem indoors, unless mold spores land on a wet or damp spot and begin growing. Allergic reactions to molds are common. Allergic responses include high fever-type symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose, and red eyes.

=== Home safety practices ===

'''Slip and trip-''' [[falling accident]]s at home are very common and can cause serious and life-threatening injuries, so prevention of [[slip and trip]] accidents is essential in the good design of living quarters. The objective is especially important for the elderly and disabled, who may be of restricted movement and more susceptible to [[hazard]]s. It includes of adequate supports such as [[handrail]]s and [[balustrade]]s as well as ensuring walking surfaces are of high [[friction]] and thus [[:wikt:slip|slip]] resistant. [[Lighting]] is also vital for being bright enough to enable the user to see obstacles when walking into a room, for example. Users may also be provided with a [[walking stick]] or [[crutches]] to aid walking and personal support. [[Fall prevention]] is an active form of protection for users.

'''Radon testing and mitigation –''' The two types of [[radon gas]] testing devices are, passive and active. A person can set up a kit in their home or hire a professional to perform the test. If the test result comes back with high concentrations of radon, there are ways to reduce radon gas and bring it to acceptable levels. There are proven methods to reduce radon in a home or building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friv.com/radon/healthrisks.html US Environmental Protection Agency -  Health Risks]&lt;/ref&gt; One method uses a vent pipe system and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside. This system, known as a soil suction radon reduction system, involves minor changes to your home.

'''Carbon monoxide detectors –''' [[Carbon monoxide]] (CO) detectors located in key areas inside the home is a preventative measure against CO poisoning.  The gas is created during [[incomplete combustion]] in [[central heating]] [[boiler]]s as well as in open fires for example. [[Chimney]]s to such devices can become blocked, and so the gas can enter living spaces. Only very low levels are toxic and since the gas is odorless, is a serious [[hazard]]. For multi-level homes, it is recommended having a minimum of one carbon monoxide detector per floor. For added protection, put a CO detector in each room and a utility/furnace room.

''' Toxic mold -''' Preventative steps include drying water damage and moisture control in the home. Inhaling or touching mold or mold spores may cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.

'''Burns/Fire:'''

'''Family safety plans''' – Family safety plans are an essential tool in fire safety because the plan helps family members to identify a fire escape plan. A safety plan includes knowing two ways out of every room, a safe place for members to meet outside of a burning home, and essential emergency telephone numbers.  It is important to practice fire escape plans.

'''Sprinklers''' – [[Fire sprinkler]]s offer a layer of protection because the sprinkler can respond to fire while it is still small. Fire sprinklers &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homefiresprinkler.org/images/HomeFireSprinklerFacts.pdf Home Fire Sprinkler Coalition]&lt;/ref&gt; respond only the sprinkler closest to the heat source. Smoke alone will not set a fire sprinkler to discharge.

:'''Fire extinguishers''' – There are five different classes of fires; A, B, C, D, and K. Class A consists of burning paper, wood, cloth or other combustible solids.  Class B consists of liquids and gasses such as propane. Class C fires consist of electrical fires. While class D fires (which is less common) consists of burning metal and class K fires (the most common) consists of kitchen type materials, i.e., grease and oil.

:[[Fire extinguisher]]s use a variety of substances to put out fires; dry powder, dry chemical, water, halogenated, carbon and foam. Since different substances burn differently, fire extinguishers are labeled (and often color-coded) according to the type or class of fire they can extinguish. It is, therefore, necessary to choose the correct fire extinguisher for home use.

:'''Fire alarms'''– [[Fire alarm]]s monitors the environmental changes associated with combustion.  Once the alarm has been triggered by fire or smoke, a loud sound emanates to warn of danger and sends a message to a central monitoring center, which then notifies the local fire department.

:'''Smoke alarms''' – [[Smoke detector|Smoke alarms]] also known as smoke detectors, generally sound an audible and visual alarm. Smoke alarms are usually housed in a disk-shaped plastic enclosure about 6 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick and are often powered by a disposable battery.

:'''Heat detectors''' – Heat detectors are a device that responds to changes in ambient temperature. Heat detectors are not meant to replace smoke detectors. They are often placed in rooms where standard smoke detectors are not suitable, such as laundry rooms, garages, and attics.

'''Home Fire Escape Plans'''- Create a fire escape plan with two exits from every room, and conduct practice drills with the entire family at least once every six months. When creating the fire escape plan, draw a layout that shows each room and potential escape route in the home. Explain the escape plan to children and ensure that they recognize the sound of the fire alarm and know to check the door for heat and how to stay low to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movoto.com/blog/home-safety/home-fire-safety-movoto/ Home Fire Safety by Movoto]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poison''' - Always have the number of your local [[Poison control center|Poison Control Center]] available and familiarize yourself with what to do in case of poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/poisoning.htm Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -  Poisoning: Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Know which plants are poisonous and remove them from your home. Keep all medications, including over-the-counter medications secured and out of the reach of children. DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care professional.

==Standards organizations==

There are a number of organizations in the United States and other jurisdictions that release or maintain standards on the topic of home safety, including:

* [[Home Safety Council]]
* [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]
* National Fire Safety Council
* [[National Safety Council]]

In Africa, the idea of ''human rights'' is a comparatively recent phenomenon. Contributing to the establishment of human rights system in Africa are the United Nations, [[international law]] and the [[African Union]] which have positively influenced the betterment of the human rights situation in the country. However, extensive human rights abuses still occur in many sections of the continent. Most of the violations can be attributed to political instability (as a consequence of civil war), racial discrimination, corruption, post-colonialism, economic scarcity, ignorance, illness, religious bigotry, debt and bad financial management,  monopoly of power, lack/absence of judicial and press autonomy, and border conflicts. Many of the provisions contained in regional, national, continental, and global agreements remained unaccomplished.  

== African human rights system ==
The '''African Charter''' is a human rights document made up of 68 articles carved up into four sections -- Human and Peoples’ Rights; Duties; Procedure of the Commission; and Applicable Principles. It merges the three clusters of rights, namely, civil and political rights, economic, social, and cultural rights, and group and peoples’ rights. It enforces obligations on individual members of each African society and connects the ideas of human rights, peoples’ rights, and duties on people.&lt;ref&gt;''The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights'', June 27, 1981, OAU Doc. CAB/LEG/67/3/Rev.5 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The organ commissioned to interpret the Charter, as well as investigate individual complaints is the '''African Commission on Human and People's Rights''' (ACHPR). The ACHPR was established based on Art. 30 of the Charter and was inaugurated in November 1987. The ACHPR meets two times a year and its secretariat is headquartered in Banjul (Gambia).&lt;ref&gt;Killander, M. and Abebe, A. (2011). "Human rights developments in the AU." ''African Human Rights Journal.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Promotion of human rights and its protection ==

== Human rights education ==
Human rights are “rights one has simply because one is a human being.”&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly, Jack. (2003). ''Universal human rights in theory and practice''. 2nd edition. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;  These privileges and civil liberties are innate in every person without prejudice and where ethnicity, place of abode, gender, cultural origin, skin color, religious affiliation, or language, do not matter.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (2009). "What are human rights?" Retrieved 24 August 2018 from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Pages/WhatareHumanRights.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to learn and to be knowledgeable about human rights is known as ''human rights education''. It basically refers to “all learning that develops the knowledge, skills, and values of human rights.”&lt;ref&gt;Stone, A. (2002). "Human rights education and public policy in the United States: Mapping the road ahead." ''Human Rights Quarterly'', ''24'', 537-557.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights education covers an extensive array of ideals and standards that include peace, justice and tolerance, egalitarianism, diplomacy, and value for human dignity. By upholding recognition of and advancing respect for human rights in all civilizations, it allows learners to dynamically contribute in putting together a sustainable and a non-violent future.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. (2011). ''Contemporary issues in human rights education''. France: United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and Cultural Organization, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Amnesty International, human rights education is a purposeful, participatory practice intended to empower people and communities by nurturing the love for knowledge, encourage the acquisition of skills, and development of attitudes and mindset aligned with globally accepted standards. It aspires to put together a culture of respect for prompt action in the protection and encouragement of human rights for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, ''Human Rights Education.'' Retrieved 28 August 2018 athttp://www.amnestymena.org/en/WhoWeAre/HumanRightsEducation.aspx?media=print&lt;/ref&gt;

In law enforcement, human rights education aims to elevate learners’ consciousness  and understanding of rights agreements in order to guarantee the safeguarding of people's rights in a community, transparency in government dealings and activities, liability/responsibility in civic transactions, and the balanced and impartial employment of force.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE (2012). ''Guidelines on Human Rights Education for Law Enforcement Officials.'' Vienna, Austria: Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, human rights education manifests through popular education or community education with the purpose of organizing people and activating constituencies in the expansion and intensification of social movements.These community-based models have been created and established in rustic areas of Latin America, Asia, and Africa.  

Such human rights education efforts are seen as both a political and an academic approach to assist democratic processes and achieve dynamic citizenship. Given focus in these education efforts are civil, political, social, economic, and cultural rights and a combination of equality rights for certain type of groups. As a result, human rights education differs in substance, method and strategy, extent, concentration, profundity, and accessibility.

== African women's rights ==
Significant improvements have been made toward the development of African women’s rights and female political involvement at both the national and local levels. The continent has espoused a number of lawful mechanisms, like the Maputo Protocol, declarations, such as the African Union Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa, and resolutions aimed to guarantee women’s rights. These instruments likewise created numerous monitoring entities to ensure the fulfillment of African women’s ideals.&lt;ref&gt;UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (2016). ''Women’s Rights in Africa.'' African Union Commission Women, Gender &amp; Development. Retrieved 29 August 2018 from https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/WomensRightsinAfrica_singlepages.pdf, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; However, African women have continuously been confronted with absurd challenges in the sphere of economics, in their social lives, and in their positions within the community, specifically when it comes to healthcare and education. Sufficient healthcare, contraception awareness, and understanding of safe abortion is deficient because of the continent’s derisory health infrastructure, making it tough for women to have satisfactory access to health clinics. &lt;ref&gt;UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (2016). ''Women’s Rights in Africa.'' African Union Commission Women, Gender &amp; Development. Retrieved 29 August 2018 from https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/WomensRightsinAfrica_singlepages.pdf, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, African women incessantly tail behind African men in their facility to have access, use, and control of land and other resources, which make them defenseless in states of conflict and unprotected in times of calamities.&lt;ref&gt;UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (2016). ''Women’s Rights in Africa.'' African Union Commission Women, Gender &amp; Development. Retrieved 29 August 2018 from https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/WomensRightsinAfrica_singlepages.pdf, page 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maputo Protocol''' fixes the values for women’s human rights in Africa. In this treaty, the description of violence against women distinguishes both physical and emotional aggression as well as threats of cruelty and sadism. It identifies the role of women in political and public life while persuading state parties to allocate more in time and money for legislation and other procedures that could secure equal representation of women and men in decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;African Commission on Human and People’s Rights. (2003). ''Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa.'' Retrieved 31 August 2018 from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol/#9&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The protocol provides for the legal ban on female genital mutilation as well as the consent to abortion in cases of rape, incest, sexual mauling, and the continued pregnancy that threatens the mental and physical health/life of the mother or the fetus. It is also the first international human rights agreement to unequivocally talks about HIV/AIDS. Other provisions  contained in the protocol address established but destructive practices, child marriage, polygamy, inheritance, economic empowerment, women’s political participation, education, and women in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Human Rights (2016). ''A guide to the African human rights system.'' South Africa: Pretoria University Law Press (PULP), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  

== African children's rights ==
Different types of violence and maltreatment wreak havoc on the lives of numerous children in Africa. These include economic and sexual abuse, gender bias in education, and being caught in the crossfire during armed conflicts. According to UNICEF, there are approximately 150 million children in the 5-14 age range who are engaged in hard labor and adult work.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. "The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child." Retrieved 31 August 2018 from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.unicef.org/esaro/children_youth_5930.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Created to defend children and safeguard their innate rights, the '''''African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child''''' (ACRWC) was created. It also serves as the major legal instrument within the African human rights system that clarifies the rights and privileges that African nations must guarantee to their children. Other concerns that African states want the charter to address include issues confronting children living under apartheid, child marriage, female genital mutilation (FGM), internal conflicts and displacement, rights of children whose mothers have been incarcerated, unsanitary living conditions, and the role of the family in adoption and fostering.

=== Child soldiers ===

==== Definition ====
According to the ''Paris Principles and Guidelines on Children Associated with Armed Forces or Armed Groups'', a child soldier is a “any person below 18 years of age who has been recruited or used by an armed force or armed group in any capacity, including but not limited to children, boys, and girls used as fighters, cooks, porters, messengers, spies or for sexual purposes."&lt;ref&gt;De Villiers, Shirley. “FACTSHEET: How many child soldiers are there in Africa?” 26 August 2015. Retrieved 3 September 2018 from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-how-many-child-soldiers-are-there-in-africa/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Child soldiers are often compulsorily drafted by use of force, by kidnapping them or by issuing grave threats to them. Others willingly sign up to avoid extreme hardships and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Vindevogel, S., Coppens, K., Derluyn, I., Loots, G,\. and Broekaert, E. (2011). "Forced conscription of children during armed conflict: Experiences of former child soldiers in Northern Uganda." ''Child Abuse &amp; Neglect,'' ''35'', 551–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest reasons for employing child soldiers is that they are viewed as dispensable, or “throwaways” and maintaining them does not cost much. They are also seen as more susceptible compared to adults, who already have more defined personalities. Since children lack a sense of apprehension, they accept more hazardous errands without analyzing what they are getting into.&lt;ref&gt;Wessels, Michael (2006). ''Child Soldiers: From Violence to Protection''. London: Harvard University Press, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations safeguarding African human rights ==
There are nine international organizations working for the protection of African human rights, namely, ''Human Rights Watch'', ''International Committee of the Red Cross'', ''Global Rights'', ''Amnesty International'', ''International Federation for Human Rights'', ''Refugees International'', ''UN Watch'', ''Human Rights Foundation'', and ''Protection International''. &lt;ref&gt;Mouneimne, Jess (2017). “Human rights: Nine of the best and worst in Africa.” Retrieved 31 August 2018 from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.africanindy.com/news/human-rights-nine-of-the-best-and-worst-in-africa-8309517&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human rights situation by country ==
{{List|section|date=December 2017}}
===North Africa===
In '''Algeria''', major human rights issues include unauthorized intrusion of privacy, establishment of laws barring specific of free expression, criminal defamation laws that are usually indistinct, restrictions on freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and association, corruption of government officials, lack or absence of independence and neutrality in the judiciary, gross domestic violence against women, prohibition of same sex activities, sexual abuse on LGBTI persons, and human trafficking. While the government took efforts in examining, taking legal action, and punishing public officials who commit violations, impunity for police and security officials still exists and remains a problem in this country.&lt;ref&gt;''Algeria 2017 Human Rights Report'', retrieved 28 August 2018 from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://dz.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/236/Human_Rights-Report_2017-Algeria.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016 in '''Egypt''', public criticism of the government was declared banned. People get arrested when they have been suspected or proven to be involved in protests or attended protest rallies. Travel bans were ordered and assets of known human rights organizations were seized or frozen. Criminal charges were directed at NGO directors and the head of the Press Syndicate and against Egypt's leading anti-corruption personality. Members of the security forces continue to persecute and torment detainees and hundreds of people have mysteriously disappeared with little or no accountability in the part of government officials for infringement of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, ''World Report 2017.'' Retrieved 28 August 2018 from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/egypt&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2018, a UN document reported that thousands of horrible human rights violations have been performed by state-affiliated militias in '''Libya'''.&lt;ref&gt;Zaptia, Sami, “Thousands of human rights violations carried out by state-affiliated Libyan militias: UN report,” ''April 2018, Libya Herald. Retrieved 28 August 2018 from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.libyaherald.com/2018/04/10/thousands-of-human-rights-violations-carried-out-by-state-affiliated-libyan-militias-un-report/&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Amnesty International reports, forces allied to existing competing governments -- in addition to the armed groups and private armies – continuously commit with grave callousness the desecration of global decrees and aggression towards human rights. These groups carry out random attacks in densely populated areas leading to thousands of civilian deaths. They persistently abduct, capriciously arrest and detain thousands of people for an indefinite period. Ruthless persecution and employment of other cruel methods were conducted inside prison cells. Women are confronted with abject discrimination, including illogical limitations on their right to travel. The death penalty continues to be in force.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, “LIBYA 2017/2018.” Retrieved 28 August 2018 from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/libya/report-libya/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Independent Payment Advisory Board''', or '''IPAB''', was to be a fifteen-member [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] [[Government agency|agency]] created in 2010 by sections 3403 and 10320 of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] which was to have the explicit task of achieving specified savings in Medicare without affecting coverage or quality. Under previous and current law, changes to Medicare payment rates and program rules are recommended by [[MedPAC]] but require an act of Congress to take effect.  The system creating IPAB granted IPAB the authority to make changes to the Medicare program with the Congress being given the power to overrule the agency's decisions through supermajority vote.  The [[Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018]] repealed IPAB before it could take effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|115|123}} sec. 52001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2013, the Chief Actuary of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] determined in particular years the projected per capita growth rate for Medicare for a multi-year period ending in the second year thereafter (the "implementation year"). If the projection exceeded a target growth rate, IPAB was to develop a proposal to reduce Medicare spending in the implementation year by a specified amount. If it was required to develop a proposal, the Board was to submit that proposal in January of the year before the implementation year; thus, the first proposal could have been submitted in January 2014 to take effect in 2015. If the Board failed to submit a proposal that the Chief Actuary certifies would achieve the savings target, the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] was to submit a proposal that would achieve that amount of savings.  The Secretary was then to implement the proposal unless [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted resolutions to override the Board's (or the Secretary's) decisions under a fast-track procedure that the law set forth.&lt;ref name="AMA"&gt;[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/399/hsr-payment-advisory-board.pdf Independent Payment Advisory Board] American Medical Association. "By Jan 1, 2015, and at least every other year thereafter, the IPAB will submit recommendations to slow the growth in national health care expenditures while preserving or enhancing quality of care."&lt;/ref&gt;

A related group, the [[Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee]] (or Relative Value Update Committee; RUC), composed of [[physician]]s associated with the [[American Medical Association]], also advises the government about pay standards for Medicare patient procedures, according to news reports.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150531"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pear |first=Robert |title=Federal Investigators Fault Medicare's Reliance on Doctors for Pay Standards |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/us/federal-investigators-fault-medicares-reliance-on-doctors-for-pay-standards.html |date=May 31, 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=June 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 9, 2018, the United States Congress voted to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board as a part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018,&lt;ref name= p610&gt;"[https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Bipartisan%20Budget%20Act%20of%202018.pdf#page=610 Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018]".

"[http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/373092-senate-passes-bill-to-end-shutdown Senate passes bill to end shutdown, sending it to House]". ''The Hill''.&lt;/ref&gt; and by a vote of 240−186 in US House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll069.xml  Final Vote Results for Roll Call 69]". ''United States House of Representatives''. February 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter that day, President Trump signed the budget bill into law,&lt;ref&gt;Kamisar, Ben; Zanona, Melanie; Marcos, Cristina (February 9, 2018). "[http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/373107-trump-signs-budget-deal-ending-shutdown Trump signs budget deal ending shutdown]". ''The Hill''.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby repealing the IPAB.&lt;ref name= p610/&gt;

==Background==
Congress created IPAB as a strengthened version of the [[Medicare Payment Advisory Commission]] (MedPAC), a body with no regulatory power that solely advises Congress, but cannot enact regulations in and of itself. Since 1997, MedPAC had recommended cuts totaling "hundreds of billions of dollars" to Medicare that were ignored by Congress.&lt;ref name="Hill2"&gt;Mike Lillis. [http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/health-reform-implementation/111425-gop-leaders-push-to-repeal-medicare-cost-cutting-panel- “GOP leaders push to repeal Medicare cost-cutting panel.”] ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''. (July 28, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Congress has pressured Medicare administrators to cover "ineffective or needlessly costly methods of care," while Medicare's founding legislation says "Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize any Federal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control over the practice of medicine."&lt;ref name="Aaron"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= [[Henry J. Aaron]] | title = The Independent Payment Advisory Board – Congress's 'Good Deed' | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |date=May 2011 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1105144 | pmid = 21561342 |url=http://healthpolicyandreform.nejm.org/?p=14433 | volume=364 | issue=25 | pages=2377–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Aaron, a health care expert at the [[Brookings Institution]], said that many observers saw that some in Congress are "in thrall to campaign contributors and producers and suppliers of medical services" and most are not well enough informed to wisely use Medicare's buying power to reform health care.&lt;ref name="Aaron"/&gt; The idea behind the IPAB was to take power away from Congress (and [[special interests]]&lt;ref name="EconMan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rockefeller: The Economists' Man in the Senate? |author=[[David Leonhardt]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 8, 2009 |url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/rockefeller-the-economists-man-in-the-senate/ |accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in order to give it to those knowledgeable in health care policy.&lt;ref name="Canwe"&gt;{{cite news|title=Can we control costs without Congress? |author=[[Ezra Klein]] |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 26, 2010 |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/03/can_we_control_costs_without_c.html |accessdate=June 18, 2011 |archivedate=June 18, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zXef5Wni?url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/03/can_we_control_costs_without_c.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative history===
On June 25, 2009, Senator [[Jay Rockefeller]] introduced the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission Reform Act of 2009, which would have changed MedPAC into an executive branch agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|S.|1380}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, 2009, the Obama Administration submitted to Congress a similar proposal called the Independent Medicare Advisory Council Act, which would have created an independent five-member executive council to make recommendations to the president. From June 17 to September 14, 2009, three Democratic and three Republican [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] members met for a series of thirty-one meetings to discuss the development of a health care reform bill. During this period, Senators [[Max Baucus]] (D-Montana), [[Chuck Grassley]] (R-Iowa), [[Kent Conrad]] (D-North Dakota), [[Olympia Snowe]] (R-Maine), [[Jeff Bingaman]] (D-New Mexico), and [[Mike Enzi]] (R-Wyoming), met for more than sixty hours, and their discussions established the principles upon which the health care reform legislation that later passed was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Care Reform from Conception to Final Passage|accessdate=November 23, 2010|url=http://finance.senate.gov/issue/?id=32be19bd-491e-4192-812f-f65215c1ba65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Finance Committee included a provision establishing an independent Medicare advisory board in its health reform legislation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GOP Faces Choice If Health Bill Passes |author=Ronald Brownstein |newspaper=[[National Journal]] |date=November 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which passed the Senate on December 24, 2009.&lt;ref name="Stockdale"&gt;Holly Stockdale. [http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/R40915_20100126.pdf ''An Overview of Proposals to Establish an Independent Commission or Board in Medicare''.] Washington, D.C.: Congressional Research Service, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
IPAB was tasked with developing specific proposals to bring the net growth in Medicare spending back to target levels if the Medicare Actuary determines that net spending was forecast to exceed target levels, beginning in 2015.

With regard to IPAB's recommendations, the law said: "The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums under section 1818, 1818A, or 1839, increase Medicare beneficiary cost sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|111|490}}; to be codified at {{USC|42|1899A(c)(2)(A)(ii).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) was to implement these proposals unless Congress adopted equally effective alternatives. The board was also to be required to submit to Congress annual reports on [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]], access, quality, and utilization. IPAB was to submit to Congress recommendations on how to slow the growth in total private health care expenditures.&lt;ref name="Jost"/&gt;

Every year, on September 1, IPAB was to submit a draft proposal to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. On January 15 of the next year, IPAB was to submit a proposal to Congress. If IPAB failed to meet this deadline, the HHS was to create its own proposal. Congress was to consider this proposal under special rules. Congress could not consider any amendment to the proposal that would not achieve similar cost reductions unless both houses of Congress, including a three-fifths super majority in the Senate, voted to waive this requirement. If Congress failed to adopt a substitute provision by August 15, HHS was to implement the proposal as originally submitted to Congress.&lt;ref name="Jost"/&gt;

==Membership and term of office==
IPAB was to be composed of fifteen members appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]], subject to [[Advice and consent|Senate confirmation]]. The [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]], the Administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the [[Health Resources and Services Administration|Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration]] were to serve ''[[ex officio]]'' as nonvoting members.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|111|502}}; to be codified at {{USC|42|1899A(g)(1)(A).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making the appointments, the President was to consult with the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Majority Leader of the Senate]] concerning the appointment of three members; the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] concerning the appointment of three members, the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Minority Leader of the Senate]] concerning the appointment of three members, and the [[Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader of the House of Representatives]] concerning the appointment of three members.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|111|503}}; to be codified at {{USC|42|1899A(g)(1)(E).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first members appointed to the Board were to be divided into three staggered classes in order to ensure that their terms would not expire simultaneously. Five were to be appointed for a term of one year, five were to be appointed for a term of three years, and five were to be appointed for a term of six years. All subsequent appointments were to be made for six years. A member was not to serve more than two full consecutive terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|111|503}}; to be codified at {{USC|42|1899A(g)(2).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appointed members of the IPAB were to include individuals with national recognition for their expertise in health finance and economics, actuarial science, health
facility management, health plans and integrated delivery systems, health facilities reimbursement, and other providers of health services or related fields to provide a mix of professionals, a broad geographic representation, and a balance between urban and rural areas. IPAB members were to include (but will not be limited to) physicians and other health professionals, experts in the area of pharmaco-economics or prescription drug benefit programs, employers, third-party payers, individuals skilled in the conduct and interpretation of biomedical, health services, and health economics research, and expertise in outcomes and effectiveness research and technology assessment. Members also were to include individuals representing consumers and the elderly. Individuals who were directly involved in providing or managing the delivery of Medicare items and services were not to constitute a majority of IPAB's membership.

The President of the United States was to [[executive order|establish a system]] for [[freedom of information|public disclosure]] by IPAB members of any financial and other potential conflicts of interest. No IPAB member was to be engaged in any other business, vocation or employment.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;

Members were to be paid at a rate described in Level III of the [[Executive Schedule]] that determines pay for senior executive branch officials. As of 2010, this was $165,300 a year.&lt;ref name="Jost"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Jost, Timothy Stoltzfus | title = The Independent Payment Advisory Board | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 363 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–105 |date=July 2010 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1005402 | pmid = 20505171 | url = http://healthpolicyandreform.nejm.org/?p=3478 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
Congress appropriated $15 million for IPAB in 2012. Future funding for the agency was to be based on this figure adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref name="Jost"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Predicted outcomes===
A 2009 ''[[Kaiser Health News]]'' article predicted [[primary care doctor]]s would likely see benefits from an "independent Medicare commission because the panel would be more likely to increase their fees and lower specialists' rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Most health industry players would win under overhaul |author=Phil Galewitz |newspaper=[[Kaiser Health News]] |publisher=[[McClatchy Washington DC News Bureau]] |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/08/16/73802/most-health-industry-players-would.html |date=August 16, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While payment cuts to hospitals and hospices were to be off-limits until 2020, and clinical laboratories were to be off limits until 2016, physician fees could have been cut unless a [[doc fix]] to Medicare's sustainable growth rate formula made those cuts off limits.&lt;ref name="Aaron"/&gt; Other "savings would have to have been found in private [[Medicare Advantage]] plans, Medicare's Part D prescription-drug program, or spending on skilled-nursing facilities, home-based health care, [[dialysis]], durable medical equipment, ambulance services, and services of ambulatory surgical centers".&lt;ref name="Aaron"/&gt; According to the New England Journal of Medicine, holding off creation of [[accountable care organization]]s (ACOs) was likely to be a bad long term strategy for physicians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1011712&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of IPAB charged that the board's cost-cutting mandate would inevitably bring about a reduction in care, despite the anti-rationing language in the bill. Congressman [[Phil Roe (politician)|Phil Roe]] from Tennessee, a doctor, warned that IPAB would ration care through payment policy. [[American Medical News]] charged that the bill gave IPAB "unprecedented, dangerous authority to cut Medicare pay rates and strangle access to care."&lt;ref&gt;Fiegl, Charles, [http://www.amednews.com/article/20121015/government/310159952/4/ "Medicare IPAB: Rational or rationing?"], ''American Medical News'', October 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experts===
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
Health economist [[Uwe Reinhardt]] thought that given the "dubious style of [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign financing]] of which we all are victims now," an independent Medicare commission was the U.S.'s only hope to restrain Medicare spending.&lt;ref name="Helping"&gt;{{cite news |title=Helping Or Hurting Medicare? |author=Marilyn Werber Serafini |newspaper=[[National Journal]] |date=December 21, 2009 |url=http://healthcare.nationaljournal.com/2009/12/helping-or-hurting-medicare.php#1402314 |accessdate=July 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reinhardt criticized former chairman of the [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health|House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health]] William Thomas' 1995 comment as emblematic of the spurious reasoning found in Congress. Of a payment system that resembled [[bundled payment]], Thomas said, "I'm not wild about a payment system that involves telling a bunch of innovative entrepreneurs that they can't be in the business anymore". Reinhardt criticized this, saying Thomas "seemed uninterested in what made more clinical and economic sense. His was purely an [[industrial policy]], not a health policy. And his reasoning explains why, year in year out, Congress has rejected economically sensible proposals to attain greater efficiency in the Medicare program."&lt;ref name="Helping"/&gt; Reinhardt compares the IPAB to a similar board in Germany, which he says is efficient, effective and civilized.&lt;ref name="Brickbats"&gt;{{cite news |title=Medicare Payment Board Draws Brickbats |author=Julie Rovner |newspaper=[[Morning Edition]] |date=July 12, 2011 |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/07/12/137774959/medicare-payment-board-draws-brickbats |accessdate=July 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Former CBO directors====
[[Peter Orszag]], who directed the CBO and OMB in the Obama administration, said the IPAB may have been the most important aspect of the Affordable Care Act.&lt;ref name="Motherjones"&gt;James Ridgeway. [http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/07/health-care-rationing-death-panels "Meet the Real Death Panels."] ''Mother Jones''. (July/August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; He said the board was "created to help address our long-term fiscal imbalance while boosting quality in health care".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Jon Meacham]] |date=May 10, 2010&lt;!-- date associated with the volume and issue, not the internet article--&gt; |title=In Search of a Fiscal Cure |journal=[[Newsweek]] |volume=155 |issue=19 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/04/30/in-search-of-a-fiscal-cure.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; "It's a very promising structure," said Orszag, but he cautioned that "whether it realizes its potential depends on how it's implemented."&lt;ref name="Moving"/&gt;

[[Douglas Holtz-Eakin]], a former CBO director and an economist who is currently president of [[American Action Network|a conservative political organization]], thought that despite "requirements that would force Congress to adopt the recommendations or find comparable savings," "cuts will be politically infeasible, as Congress is likely to continue regularly to override scheduled reductions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holtz-Eakin D, Ramlet MJ |title=Analysis &amp; commentary.

Ramlet, who rightly invoke past instances when Congress squeezed the health system and later retrenched under political pressure.

===Politicians===
Sen. [[John Cornyn]], a Republican from Texas, introduced a bill in the Senate to prevent the creation of the IPAB.&lt;ref name="Wrongway"/&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Congressman and retired physician [[Phil Roe (politician)|Phil Roe]] (R-TN) twice sponsored House bills to eliminate the IPAB, which was partially why he was regarded as a "kindred soul" by the [[medical industry]].&lt;ref name="Money"&gt;R. Jeffery Smith [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/06/AR2011020603109.html Health-related money continues to flow to members of Congress] ''The Washington Post''.

January 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Roe charged that IPAB would deny care. However, the legislation governing IPAB bared "any recommendation to ration health care."&lt;ref name="Resurrect"&gt;{{cite news |title=It's Alive!

[[Tom Daschle]], the former Senate Democratic leader who was Obama's first choice for health secretary, argued that IPAB should have been expanded to cover all forms of health insurance in order to prevent doctors from shifting costs onto patients with private medical insurance.&lt;ref name="Moving"&gt;{{cite news |title=After Health Care Passage, Obama Pushes to Get It Rolling |author=Jackie Calmes |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 18, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/health/policy/18cost.html |accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After voting for the 2010 health care reform, [[Pete Stark]] (D-Calif.), said that the IPAB "sets [Medicare] up for unsustainable cuts" that will endanger the health of patients, and that he would "work tirelessly to mitigate the damage" the panel would cause.&lt;ref name="Hill1"&gt;Julian Pecquet.

(October 19, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobbying groups===
The [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] said that elimination of the payment board was its top priority in the 2011 Congress.&lt;ref name="Industry Aims"/&gt; The [[American Hospital Association]] and the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) have spoken out against the board.&lt;ref name="Industry Aims"&gt;Duff Wilson [http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/industry-targets-medicare-board/ "Industry Aims at Medicare Board"] ''The New York Times''. November 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Live Health Chat: Health care law changes |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMA wanted to change the IPAB requirement that members have no outside employment so working physicians could be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SPECIALTY DOCTORS TO VISIT CONGRESS JUNE 23 TO DISCUSS DOC FIX, IPAB, CODES |newspaper=Inside CMS|date=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMA also opposed any independent commission which could cut physician payment rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/399/hsr-hr3590-ipab-provision-letter.pdf |title=Letter to the Honorable Harry Reid &amp; Sen.

Dr. J. Fred Ralston Jr., president of the [[American College of Physicians]] (ACP), expressed support for the idea behind the IPAB, saying "making complex Medicare payment and budgetary decisions is very difficult within a political process with substantial lobbying pressures," but the group wanted to see significant changes. The ACP supported creating a position for a primary care physician on IPAB, additional protections to ensure that cost reductions would not lead to lower quality of care, authority for Congress to reject proposals made by IPAB via a simple majority vote, and equal treatment of all healthcare providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Implementing Health Reform On the Independent Payment Advisory Board |newspaper=Internal Medicine News |date=August 1, 2010 |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |url=http://www.internalmedicinenews.com/views/implementing-health-reform/blog/the-independent-payment-advisory-board/f5efc423af.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Elaine C. Jones, government relations committee cochair of the [[American Academy of Neurology]] stated, "We are also very concerned about the power of the IPAB to cut payments to physicians. The sole function of the IPAB is to cut spending with little guarantee of maintaining quality, access, and scientifically proven care. There may be no physician representation on the board either. These elements are concerning and unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Physicians Offer Rx for Fixing Health Reform Law
 |author=Mary Ellen Schneider |newspaper=Internal Medicine News|date=March 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ron Pollack, the founding executive director of the health care advocacy group [[Families USA]], advised Democrats against being divided and conquered by supporting repeal of specific portions of the health care reform, such as IPAB.&lt;ref name="Dems prepare defense"&gt;Julian Pecquet [http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/health-reform-implementation/134441-with-repeal-threat-looming-democrats-set-to-defend-healthcare-law Dems prepare defense of healthcare law in face of repeal threats] ''The Hill''. December 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major nursing home associations, the [[American Health Care Association]] and the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, along with seventy two other healthcare groups, urged Congress to reject IPAB. They argued that the board would have had too much control over Medicare and would affect the ability of healthcare providers to lobby for changes in how they are reimbursed. The groups also argued that IPAB would have only been accountable to the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Providers try to quash Medicare payment board proposal |newspaper=McKnights Long Term Care News and McKnights Assisted Living
 |date=January 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons]] made IPAB a focus of their advocacy work.  Hospital exemptions from 2015 to 2020 as well as the lack of practicing physicians on the board itself were major concerns. Lobbying efforts in April 2011 focused on making these modifications if not fully eliminating the board.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Medical specialty groups spearheaded efforts to repeal IPAB.  The [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] and [[American Association of Neurological Surgeons]] co-lead a coalition of 26 medical specialties and patient organizations representing more than 350,000 physicians and their patients dedicated to repealing IPAB.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asahq.org/For-Members/Advocacy/Washington-Alerts/IPAB-Repeal-Coalition-endorses-the-Protecting-Seniors-Access-to-Medicare-Act-of-2013.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://politi.co/XVzKV9&lt;/ref&gt;  The coalition endorsed efforts in the [[113th Congress]] to repeal IPAB.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asahq.org/For-Members/Advocacy/Washington-Alerts/~/media/For%20Members/Advocacy/IPAB/Protecting%20Seniors%20Access%20to%20Medicare%20Act%20Endorsement11813.ashx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Dean]], a consultant for [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[lobbying firm]] [[McKenna, Long and Aldridge]] and former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Governor of Vermont]], believed the IPAB would fail to control costs and should be abolished. He opposed the premise of the board, writing in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that it was "a health-care rationing body" and that "rate setting—the essential mechanism of the IPAB—has a 40-year track record of failure."&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Dean|Dean, Howard]] (July 28, 2013). "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324110404578628542498014414 The Affordable Care Act's Rate-Setting Won't Work]". ''The Wall Street Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editorials===
In an editorial opposing Sen. Cornyn's bill to repeal IPAB ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "The political system failed when it came to controlling health-care costs. The 15-member panel that Mr. Cornyn et al. deride as 'beltway bureaucrats' would be a group of experts in the field, nominated by the president, chosen in part by congressional leaders of the opposing party and subject to Senate confirmation. Congress isn't bound by its proposals if lawmakers can come up with what they think is a better approach. Getting costs under control is going to require difficult choices – including, in the case of Medicare, difficult political choices. This unwise bill is not a good sign about Washington's willingness to make them."&lt;ref name="Wrongway"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wrong way on health care; A Republican proposal to eliminate a cost control board is a bad prescription. |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=August 16, 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/15/AR2010081502470.html |accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death panel controversy===
The term "[[death panel]]" was used in conjunction with IPAB.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Avik, [http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/256127/epistemology-death-panels-avik-roy The Epistemology of Death Panels], ''National Review'', December 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Palin wrote in the ''Wall Street Journal'' that the [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform]] "implicitly endorses the use of "death panel"-like rationing by way of the new Independent Payments [sic] Advisory Board."&lt;ref&gt;Palin, Sarah, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703766704576009322838245628 Why I Support the Ryan Roadmap], ''Wall Street Journal'', December 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The New York Times'' reported some Obama administration officials feared the Independent Payment Advisory Board could be "target for attacks of the 'death panel' sort";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=After Health Care Passage, Obama Pushes to Get It Rolling |author=Jackie Calmes |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 17, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/health/policy/18cost.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An October 2010 [[National Right to Life Committee|National Right to Life]] article wrote the IPAB was "a good candidate for the title of 'death panel,'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burke J. Balch | date=October  2010 |title=Are ObamaCare "Death Panels" Truly a Myth? |journal=National Right to Life News |publisher=[[National Right to Life Committee]] |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=10, 18 |url=http://www.nrlc.org/news_and_views/Oct10/nv100110part2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a December 2010 ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial associated 'death panels' with the IPAB.&lt;ref&gt;Rivkin, David and Foley, Elizabeth Price, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203513204576047742746513406 'Death Panels' Come Back to Life], ''Wall Street Journal'', December 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Former OMB Director Orszag responded: "I think it's only in Washington, D.C., that a board created to help address our long-term fiscal imbalance while boosting quality in health care and that is specifically by law prohibited from rationing care could be called a death panel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Jon Meacham]] |date=May 10, 2010&lt;!-- date associated with the volume and issue, not the internet article--&gt; |title=In Search of a Fiscal Cure |journal=[[Newsweek]] |volume=155 |issue=19 |pages= |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/04/30/in-search-of-a-fiscal-cure.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office scoring==
The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimated{{When|date=July 2011}} that IPAB would achieve Medicare spending reductions of $28 billion through 2019—amounting to 0.4 percent of the projected Medicare spending of ~$7 trillion for the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Alain C. Enthoven]] | title = Reforming Medicare by reforming incentives | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 364 | issue = 21 | pages = e44 |date=May 2011 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1104427 | pmid = 21561341 | url = http://healthpolicyandreform.nejm.org/?p=14437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the CBO estimated the Medicare baseline level of spending would not exceed targets throughout the years of 2015 to 2021; thus, the IPAB was not expected to affect any Medicare spending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/budget/factsheets/2011b/medicare.pdf March 2011 Medicare baseline] CBO. p. 2. Retrieved October 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiscal commission report==
The 2010 presidential commission, the [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform]], issued a report on reducing the federal deficit and voted 11 to 7 to strengthen the IPAB. It wished to bring forward the time by which health care providers would be affected by IPAB decisions.&lt;ref name="hill2"&gt;Erik Wasson.

==Lawsuit==
{{main | Coons v. Geithner}}
As part of legal challenges from conservative organizations and state attorneys general in about twenty states to the Affordable Care Act, Arizona's conservative [[Goldwater Institute]], along with three Republican congressman from Arizona, filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of the IPAB.&lt;ref name="Ariz Congressmen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ariz. congressmen join health reform lawsuit |author=Elise Viebeck |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/health-reform-implementation/114165-ariz-congressmen-join-health-reform-lawsuit- |newspaper=The Hill |date=August 13, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Hill'' reported that "while the suit illustrates conservative frustration with the federal government, the courts rarely strike down advisory boards created by Congress."&lt;ref name="Ariz Congressmen"/&gt; The suit was dismissed in 2012. The Ninth Circuit found for the government on appeal, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a further appeal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/supreme-court-obamacare-case-decline-medical-board-116504&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irvine Alan Stewart Laidlaw, Baron Laidlaw''' (born 12 December 1942 in [[Keith, Scotland|Keith, Banffshire, Scotland]]) is a British businessman, and a former member of the [[House of Lords]]. In the ''[[Sunday Times Rich List 2012]]'' ranking of the wealthiest people in the UK he was placed 105th with an estimated fortune of £745 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/richlist ''Sunday Times Rich List 2012'' online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
The son of a [[Banffshire]] mill-owner, Laidlaw was educated at [[Merchiston Castle School]], [[Leeds University]] and New York City's [[Columbia Business School]].&lt;ref name="Times1"&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3822710.ece|title=Tory peer Lord Laidlaw seeks treatment for sex addiction|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=27 April 2008|accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laidlaw, a former member of the House of Lords, also donated $2 million to Columbia Business School for scholarships and increased opportunities for Business students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lord Laidlaw donates $2 million for scholarships|url=http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/newsroom/newsn/3467}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Irvine Laidlaw founded The Laidlaw Undergraduate Internship Programme in research and Leadership at the [[University of St Andrews]], after donating to the cause. He is also an honorary graduate at the university.  As well as the being the founder, Laidlaw is a trustee of The Laidlaw Schools Trust (LST), which was approved by the [[Department for Education|DfE]] as a multi-academy sponsor. It was established on 24 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Laidlaw Schools Trust approved by the DfE as a multi academy sponsor|url=http://www.laidlawschoolstrust.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation, Laidlaw turned a small US publishing company bought in 1973 into the [[Institute for International Research]] (IIR), the world's largest conference organiser. After calling off a £500m flotation in 2001 when the market plunged, he sold in 2005 for a sum believed to be in the order of £768m.&lt;ref name="Times1"/&gt;

Laidlaw previously owned and raced a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], which won [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] a number of times throughout the 1950s, along with a number of other vintage cars, including a [[Ferrari 250 GTO|1962 Ferrari GTO]]. in 2013, Irvine Laidlaw stopped racing.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind farm clinches biggest renewable financing|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-01/racing-baron-s-wind-farm-clinches-biggest-renewable-financing|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recently sold a collection of classic sports cars to raise £17 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irvine Laidlaw poised to raise £17m by selling off his collection of classic sports cars|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lord-irvine-laidlaw-expected-bring-2064604|publisher=Daily Record}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Laidlaw founded Abbey Business Centres, a subsidiary of IIR providing serviced office space, meeting room facilities and virtual office packages in 13 business centres in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2916668/Informa-beats-rivals-to-buy-Laidlaws-firm-for-1.4billion.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Harry | last=Wallop | title=Informa beats rivals to buy Laidlaw's firm for .4billion | date=2 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first business centre opened in [[Glasgow]], and soon the company opened up another centre in [[Slough]], Berkshire. Other centres were added, and in 2009 a total of 13 centres made up the organisation.

In 2015, the University of Leeds launched an official opening for the £26 million Laidlaw Library, named after Irvine Laidlaw, who had previously studied economics at the University in the 1960s. His £9 million donation is the largest the university has received from any donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New state-of-the-art Leeds library|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/lord-melvyn-bragg-opens-new-state-of-the-art-leeds-library-1-7349712|publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laidlaw part owns a $2.1 billion wind-farm project, and earlier this year secured the largest clean-energy financing in 2015 from eight lenders, which included Deutsche Bank AG.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind farm clinches biggest renewable financing|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-01/racing-baron-s-wind-farm-clinches-biggest-renewable-financing|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservative Party donations==
One of the largest financial backers of the UK's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], Laidlaw was made a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Laidlaw''', of [[Rothiemay]] in Banffshire on 14 June 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=57328 |date=17 June 2004 |page=7561}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the records of the [[UK Electoral Commission]], on 27 November 2007, Laidlaw gave a donation of £2,990,532.20 to the Conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/21/partyfunding|title=Party donations hit midterm record of £56m|publisher=The Guardian|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laidlaw donated £25,000 to the 2008 [[London Mayor]]al election campaign of [[Boris Johnson]].&lt;ref name="Times1"/&gt;

==Tax status==
In 2008, Lord Laidlaw was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a "Monaco-based [[tax exile]]".&lt;ref name='R000063'&gt;{{cite news | first=Jamie | last=Doward | author2= | title= How short-selling profited the Tories A group of high-profile hedge fund managers who have been criticised for exacerbating the financial crisis are part of an elite pack of Conservative supporters, reports Jamie Doward.

Lord Laidlaw was criticised in April 2007 in the press for failing to become UK tax resident despite being appointed to the House of Lords. The [[BBC]] said that, in a letter seen by them, Laidlaw "cites a variety of personal reasons" for non-compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3056699.ece Row over Tories’ offshore donor, Irvine Laidlaw] Sunday Times – 16 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism by [[Dennis Stevenson, Baron Stevenson of Coddenham]], chair of the [[House of Lords Appointments Commission]], on assurances given to the Commission by Laidlaw to become a UK tax resident by April 2004, were followed by Laidlaw taking leave of absence from the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/07/partyfunding.uk|title=Tory donor criticised over tax status|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 June 2007|accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 following the enactment of the [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]] he stepped down from his seat in the House of Lords to maintain his non-domiciled status and so be able to avoid paying UK residents' taxes.

==Charity donations==
In 2004, Laidlaw said that he would over the next 20–30 years donate most of his fortune to helping disadvantaged young people. His main vehicle was the Laidlaw Youth Project, which supported a range of charitable work for disadvantaged youngsters in Scotland from 2004 to 2007 when it became the Laidlaw Youth Trust. He has also donated:&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://news.scotsman.com/laidlawscharitydonations/Tycoon-Laidlaw-to-give-away.2830133.jp|title=Tycoon Laidlaw to give away fortune|publisher=The Scotsman|date=26 November 2006|accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he set up the Laidlaw Youth Trust which from 2007 to 2009 spent over £6 million in Scotland on good causes related to disadvantaged children and young people. In 2007, in emerged that the [[Scottish Executive]] had given sufficient donations to pay the salary of the CEO Laidlaw Youth project, Maureen McGinn – who is also the wife of Scotland's most senior civil servant, [[John Elvidge|Sir John Elvidge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1411844.0.executive_funded_tory_tax_exiles_charity_with_taxpayers_money.php|title=Executive funded Tory tax exile's charity with taxpayers' money|publisher=Sunday Herald|date=20 May 2007|accessdate=27 April 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528192155/http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1411844.0.executive_funded_tory_tax_exiles_charity_with_taxpayers_money.php|archivedate=28 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Laidlaw became a sponsor to Excelsior Academy in Newcastle's West End. He donated £30,000,000 towards the construction of the school.

He closed the Trust in 2009 because he was spending more time in South Africa and said he wanted to focus his charitable giving there.  It is not known how much he has gifted in his new adopted country but he was involved in some township housing project.

In 2014, an undergraduate internship scheme was set up at the [[University of St. Andrews]]  through a donation from Lord Laidlaw who is an honorary graduate of the University.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/involve/laidlaw/ | The Laidlaw Undergraduate Internship Programme in Research and Leadership}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex life allegations===
In April 2008, Laidlaw was the target of a sting operation staged by investigative journalist [[Mazher Mahmood]] on behalf of the British tabloid ''[[The News of the World]],'' which revealed that Laidlaw hires up to five £3,000 [[Prostitute|vice girls]] at a time for all-night [[orgies]] involving [[spanking]], [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and [[lesbian]] sex at his Monaco home.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4508">The '''Kameido incident''' took place in 1923 in the aftermath of the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]].

==Background==
On September 1, 1923, the Great Kantō earthquake struck [[Tokyo]] and [[Yokohama]] and martial law was imposed in the aftermath of the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture |publisher= Columbia University Press |author= John Bowman |year= Jan 22, 2005|pages= 151 | isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of September 3, the Kameido police in Tokyo began arresting known social activists, suspecting that they would "spread disorder or forment revolution amid the confusion". During the mass arrests, police arrested union leader Hirasawa Keishichi, and Nakatsuji Uhachi, a member of the Pure Laborers' Union. The [[Special Higher Police]] arrest seven members of the Nankatsu Labor Association. Army troops detained an eighth member of the association, Sato Kinji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Labor and Imperial Democracy in Prewar Japan |publisher= University of California Press |author= Andrew Gordon |year= Jan 21, 1991|pages= | isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between late at night on September 3 and September 5, troops of the 13th Cavalry Regiment on emergency duty in Kameido shot and decapitated Hirasawa and nine others. They disposed of the bodies, together with those of [[Korean people|Korean]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] massacre victims, along the banks of the Arakawa drainage canal. The police issued an official notice on October 14, claiming that troops had shot the men because they were agitating prisoners. The following year, the Liberal Lawyers' Association and union leaders worked to bring the facts to light and establish responsibility, with partial success. Police claimed to have cremated the remains of the victims. With no remains to bury, a memorial service was held in February 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Labor and Imperial Democracy in Prewar Japan |publisher= University of California Press |author= Andrew Gordon |year= Jan 21, 1991|pages= | isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Klain Bund''''' ([[Yiddish]] for 'Little Bund') was a youth organization in the [[Russian empire]], connected to the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia]]. Klain Bund was founded in 1903.&lt;ref name="bund"&gt;Minczeles, Henri. ''Histoire générale du Bund: un mouvement révolutionnaire juif''. Paris: Editions Austral, 1995. pp. 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

Klain Bund recruited secondary school pupils, students, apprentices and young workers. The average age of Klain Bund-members was around fourteen. Sometimes members joined at ages of 10-12. Often Klain Bund members were children of Bund members. Klain Bund provided socialist education for its members. Members also helped the mother party in its activities, such as collecting funds for striking workers or maintaining communications with Bundist self-defense groups.&lt;ref name="bund"/&gt;

Klain Bund was later superseded by a new Bundist youth organization, ''[[Tsukunft]]'' ('Future').&lt;ref name="bund"/&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32153">This is a '''list of bordering countries with the greatest relative differences in GDP (PPP) per person'''; specifically those pairs of neighbouring countries where the richer country is at least twice as wealthy on a per capita basis than the poorer. These statistics however do not consider differences in other economic indicators that measure welfare, such as their [[human development index]], or inequality within countries.

== Characteristics ==
The greatest cases of inequity typically would involve an impoverished and politically unstable country neighbouring a resource-rich and relatively stable one, although neither may be recognised as a [[high-income economy]]. As an extreme example, the GDP per capita for [[Saudi Arabia]], is over 42 times greater to that of its neighbour [[Yemen]]. In the four biggest ratios, the poorer country is either [[Yemen]] or [[North Korea]].


Due to lack of economic data, the [[Vatican City]] (which is surrounded by [[Italy]]), [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]] (which shares the island of [[Saint Martin]] with [[Sint Maarten]]) and the [[British Overseas Territory|British Overseas Territories]] of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] located in the island of [[Cyprus]], are not included in this list.

This '''list of royal saints and martyrs''' enumerates [[Christianity|Christian]] [[monarchs]], [[Royal family|other royalty]], and [[nobility]] who have been [[beatification|beatified]] or [[canonization|canonized]], or who are otherwise venerated as or conventionally given the appellation of "[[saint]]" or "[[Christian martyrs|martyr]]". Their names are in English and, where known, in their own language. When the status of a nominee is dubious the whole entry is ''italicized''.

==Monarchs==

This section enumerates [[Christian]] sovereigns, as opposed to mere [[spouse|consort]]s, who are enumerated in "Other royalty and nobility" below.

==Pre-Christian Saints==

[[David|King David]] of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]] of [[ancient Israel]] and Kings [[Hezekiah]] and [[Josiah]] of the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] are traditionally considered to be in [[Heaven]] by [[Catholic]] dogma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/prayers/prayer.php?p=467 "Litany to Old Testament Saints"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/quickquestions/keyword/Old%20Testament/page4 ''This Rock'' Quick Questions, Volume 14, Issue 5.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114045922/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/quickquestions/keyword/Old%20Testament/page4 |date=14 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are named as saints of the [[Old Testament]] by the [[Orthodox Church]], as numerous calendars, services for their intercession, and the custom of naming them patron saints attest. Some heterodox, however, do not recognise them as saints because they lived before the time of Christ.

The '''Lords Spiritual''' of the [[United Kingdom]] are the 26 [[bishop]]s of the [[State religion|established]] [[Church of England]] who serve in the [[House of Lords]] along with the [[Lords Temporal]]. The [[Church of Scotland]], which is [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], and the Anglican churches in [[Church in Wales|Wales]] and [[Church of Ireland|Northern Ireland]], which are no longer established churches, are not represented.

==Ranks and titles==
The Church of England comprises 42 [[diocese]]s, each led by a [[diocesan bishop]]. The [[Archbishop|Archbishops]] of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]], as Primate of All England and Primate of England, respectively, have oversight over their corresponding [[Ecclesiastical province|provinces]]. The occupants of the five "great sees"—Canterbury, York, [[Bishop of London|London]], [[Bishop of Durham|Durham]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]]—are always Lords of Parliament. The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] and the [[Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe]] may not sit in the House of Lords regardless of seniority as their dioceses lie outside both of England and of the United Kingdom. (The former, however, sits on the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man]] ''[[ex officio]]''.) Of the remaining 35 bishops, the 21 most senior sit in the House of Lords. Seniority is determined by total length of service as an English diocesan bishop (that is to say, it is not lost by translation to another see).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/lords-spiritual-and-temporal/ Lords Spiritual] from ''Parliament.uk'' retrieved 15 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-appointment/ Lords Appointment] from ''Parliament.uk'' retrieved 15 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, the power to elect archbishops and bishops is vested in the diocesan cathedral's college of canons. Practically, however, the [[appointment of Church of England bishops|choice of the archbishop or bishop]] is made prior to the election. The Prime Minister chooses from among a set of nominees proposed by the [[Crown Nominations Commission]]; the sovereign then instructs the college of canons to elect the nominated individual as a bishop or archbishop.

{{anchor|Convenor}}One of the Lords Spiritual is appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury to be the ''convenor'' of the bench; he or she coordinates the work of the bishops in the House. [[David Urquhart (bishop)|David Urquhart]], [[Bishop of Birmingham]], was appointed the current convenor on 18 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2015/05/new-convenor-of-the-lords-spiritual-announced.aspx Church of England — New Convenor of the Lords Spiritual announced] (Accessed 16 JUne 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peers==
Even during the early years of the [[Peerage]], the position of bishops was unclear. During the reign of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], the Archbishop of Canterbury declared, "of right and by the custom of the realm of England it belongeth to the Archbishop of Canterbury for the time being as well as others his suffragans, brethren and fellow Bishops, Abbots and Priors and other prelates whatsoever, — to be present in person in all the King's Parliaments whatsoever as Peers of the Realm". The claim was neither agreed nor disagreed to, however, by Parliament.

The Lords Spiritual at first declared themselves entirely outside the jurisdiction of secular authorities; the question of trial in the House of Lords did not arise. When papal authority was great, the King could do little but admit a lack of jurisdiction over the prelates. Later, however, when the power of the Pope in England was reduced, the Lords Spiritual came under the authority of the secular courts. The jurisdiction of the common courts was clearly established by the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], who declared himself head of the Church of England in place of the Pope, ending the constitutional power of the Roman Catholic Church in England.

Despite their failure to be tried as temporal peers in the House of Lords, it remained unclear whether the Lords Spiritual were indeed peers. In 1688, the issue arose during the trial of the [[Seven Bishops]]—[[William Sancroft]], Archbishop of Canterbury; [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet]], Bishop of Winchester; [[Thomas Ken]], Bishop of Bath and Wells; [[John Lake (bishop)|John Lake]], Bishop of Chester; [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]], Bishop of Worcester; [[Francis Turner (bishop)|Francis Turner]], Bishop of Ely and [[Thomas White (bishop)|Thomas White]], Bishop of Peterborough—by a common jury. The charge was that a petition sent by the Bishops constituted [[seditious libel]]; the Bishops argued that they had the [[right to petition]] the Sovereign at any time, while the prosecution charged that such a right was only permissible when Parliament was in session (which, at the time of the delivery of the petition, it was not). If the bishops were only Lords of Parliament, and not peers, their right to petition would be vitiated while Parliament was dissolved. Peers, however, were and still are counsellors of the Sovereign whether Parliament is in session or not; therefore, if the bishops were indeed peers, they would be free to send petitions.  Since there was no doubt that the petition was actually sent, while the Court still ruled the bishops not guilty, it appears that it was taken for granted that the bishops were counsellors of the Crown.

Nevertheless, the ''Standing Orders of the House of Lords'' provide, "Bishops to whom a writ of summons has been issued are not Peers but are Lords of Parliament."

==Number==
In the early history of the [[Parliament of England]], the Lords Spiritual—including the [[abbot]]s—outnumbered the Lords Temporal. Between 1536 and 1540, however, King Henry VIII [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved the monasteries]], thereby removing the seats of the abbots. For the first time and thereafter, Lords Spiritual formed a minority in the House of Lords.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/lords-history/history-of-the-lords/ History of the Lords] from ''Parliament.uk'' retrieved 15 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the 21 older dioceses (including four in Wales), Henry VIII created six new ones, of which five survived (see [[historical development of Church of England dioceses]]); the Bishops of the Church of England were excluded in 1642 but regained their seats following the Restoration; from then until the early nineteenth century  no new sees were created, and the number of lords spiritual remained at 26.

Bishops, abbots, and priors, of the [[Church of Scotland]] traditionally sat in the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. Laymen acquired the monasteries in 1560, following the [[Scottish Reformation]], and therefore those sitting as "abbots" and "priors" were all laymen after this time. Bishops of the Church of Scotland continued to sit, regardless of their religious conformity. Roman Catholic clergy were excluded in 1567, but [[Episcopal polity|Episcopal bishops]] continued to sit until they too were excluded in 1638. The bishops regained their seats following the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]], but were again excluded in 1689, following the final abolition of diocesan bishops and the permanent establishment of the Church of Scotland as Presbyterian. There are no longer [[bishops in the Church of Scotland]] in the traditional sense of the word, and that church has never sent senior clergy to sit in the House of Lords at Westminster.

Bishops and archbishops of the [[Church of Ireland]] were entitled to sit in the [[Irish House of Lords]] as Lords Spiritual. They obtained representation in the Westminster House of Lords after the union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1801. Of the Church of Ireland's ecclesiastics, four (one archbishop and three bishops) were to sit at any one time, with the members rotating at the end of every parliamentary session (which normally lasted approximately one year). The Church of Ireland, however, was [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|disestablished]] in 1871, and thereafter ceased to be represented by Lords Spiritual.

The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]], although a Bishop of the Church of England, has never been included among the English Lords Spiritual, as the [[Isle of Man]] has never been part of the Kingdom of England or of the United Kingdom. The Lord Bishop is the holder of the oldest office in [[Tynwald]] (the oldest continuous parliament in the world) and remains an ''ex officio'' member of Tynwald and its [[Legislative Council (Isle of Man)|Legislative Council]].

In the 19th century the dioceses of the Church of England began gradually to come under review again. However an increase in the bench of bishops was not considered politically expedient, and so steps were undertaken to prevent it. In 1836, the first new bishopric was founded, [[Bishop of Ripon (modern diocese)|that of Ripon]]; but it was balanced out by the merger of the [[Bishop of Bristol|Bishoprics of Bristol]] and [[Bishop of Gloucester|Gloucester]]. (They were later divided again.) The creation of the [[Bishop of Manchester|Bishopric of Manchester]] was also planned but delayed until St Asaph and Bangor could be merged. They never were; but in 1844, the [[Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847]] went ahead anyway with an alternative means to maintain the 26-bishop limit in the House of Lords: the seniority-based proviso which has been maintained to this day.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; However, the [[Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015]] gives any woman appointed a diocesan bishop in England during the next decade priority in terms of succeeding those among the current 21 who retire during that period. [[Rachel Treweek]] became Bishop of Gloucester and the first woman Lord Spiritual under the Act in 2015; [[Christine Hardman]] became the second later that year.

In 1920, with the independence of the [[Church in Wales]] from the Church of England and its [[Disestablishmentarianism|disestablishment]], the Welsh bishops stopped being eligible for inclusion.

The 26 seats for the Lords Spiritual are approximately {{#expr:2600/{{HOLtotal}}round1}}% of the total membership of the House of Lords.

==Politics==
Although the Lords Spiritual have no [[Political party|party affiliation]], they do not sit on the [[Crossbencher|crossbenches]], their seats being on the Government side of the Lords Chamber. As such, their seats are on the right-hand side of the throne, representing the fact that they, of all the members of the House of Lords, are the most loyal to the Crown.{{failed verification|date=April 2015}} Though in a full sitting the Bishops occupy almost three rows, the Lords Spiritual's front bench is subtly distinguished by being the only one in the House with a single armrest at either end; it is on the front row, close to the throne end of the chamber, indicating their unique status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/the-church-in-parliament/bishops-in-the-house-of-lords.aspx "What do Bishops do in Parliament?"] Church of England website. Retrieved 15 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

By custom at least one of the Bishops reads prayers in each legislative day (a role taken by the [[Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons|Chaplain to the Speaker]] in the Commons).&lt;ref name=shell1&gt;{{cite book|last=Shell|first=Donald|title=The House of Lords|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=2007|edition=3rd|isbn=0-7190-5443-5|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often speak in debates; in 2004 [[Rowan Williams]], then Archbishop of Canterbury, opened a debate into sentencing legislation.&lt;ref name=shell1/&gt; [[List of Church of England Measures|Measures]] ([[Bill (proposed law)|proposed laws]] of the Church of England) must be put before the Lords, and the Lords Spiritual have a role in ensuring that this take place.&lt;ref name=shell1/&gt;

==Ecclesiastics as Lords Temporal==
Other ecclesiastics have sat in the House of Lords as Lords Temporal in recent times: [[Chief Rabbi]] [[Immanuel Jakobovits]] was appointed to the House of Lords (with the consent of the Queen, who acted on the advice of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher), as was his successor Chief Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiefrabbi.org/ReadContent1849.aspx |title=Biography of the Chief Rabbi |publisher=Office of the Chief Rabbi |location=London, United Kingdom |accessdate=16 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001042614/http://www.chiefrabbi.org/ReadContent1849.aspx |archivedate=1 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his work at reconciliation and in the [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace process]] in Northern Ireland, [[Robin Eames]], the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Anglican Archbishop of Armagh]], was appointed to the Lords by [[John Major]]. Other clergymen appointed include the Methodist [[Donald Soper]], the Anglican [[Timothy Beaumont]], and some Scottish clerics.

There have been no Roman Catholic clergymen appointed, though it was rumoured that [[Basil Hume]], the [[Archbishop of Westminster]], and his successor [[Cormac Murphy O'Connor]] were offered peerages, by [[James Callaghan]], Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair respectively, but declined. Hume later accepted the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]], a personal appointment of the Queen, shortly before his death. O'Connor said he had his maiden speech ready, but ordained Roman Catholics  [[Catholic priests in public office|are prohibited]] by [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|the internal Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church]] from holding major offices connected with any government other than the [[Holy See]].

Former Archbishops of Canterbury, having reverted to the status of bishop but who are no longer diocesans, are invariably given [[life peer|life peerages]] and sit as Lords Temporal.

==2011 proposed House of Lords reform==
Under the 2011 [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition Government]] draft proposal for Lords reform, the Lords would be either 80% elected and 20% appointed, or 100% elected. In the former case there would be 12 Church of England bishops in the reformed Upper House.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61215/house-of-lords-reform-draft-bill.pdf House of Lords Reform Draft Bill] retrieved 15 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The total of 12 bishops would include the five "named Lords Spiritual" (the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and the Bishops of Durham, London and Winchester, entitled as they are to sit ''ex officio'') plus seven other "ordinary Lords Spiritual" (diocesan bishops chosen by the church itself through whatever device it deems appropriate). The reduction from 26 to 12 bishops would be achieved in a stepped fashion: up to 21 bishops would remain for the 2015–2020 period and up to 16 for the 2020–2025 period. The ordinary Lords Spirituals' terms would coincide with each "electoral period" (i.e., the period from one election to the next), with the church able to name up to seven to serve during each electoral period. These reforms were later dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18778639 Politics] from ''BBC.co.uk'' retrieved 15 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015]] whenever a vacancy arises among the Lords Spiritual during the ten years (18 May 2015 – 18 May 2025) following the Act coming into force, the vacancy has to be filled by a woman, if one is eligible. This does not apply to the sees of Canterbury, York, London, Durham and Winchester.

==Criticism==
The presence of the Lords Spiritual in the House of Lords has been criticised for being an outdated and non-democratic system by some media commentators and organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/mar/14/lords-reform-bishops-reserved-benches |title=Goodbye to the bishops &amp;#124; Polly Toynbee &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=The Guardian |date= 14 March 2010|accessdate=2013-08-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Humanist Association]] said it was "unacceptable" that "the UK is the only Western democracy to give religious representatives the automatic right to sit in the legislature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/news/UK/070212theosinjusticehol |title=Report on bishops in Lords fails to address justice and equality |publisher=Ekklesia |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://humanism.org.uk/campaigns/secularism/constitutional-reform/bishops-in-the-lords/ Bishops in the House of Lords].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3224">The '''Mica Bay Incident''' was a land and resources dispute in along the shore of [[Lake Superior]] in November 1849. It is partially responsible for the signing of the 1850 [[Robinson Treaty|Robinson-Huron Treaty]].

== Historical background ==
The Mica Bay Incident occurred immediately prior to the signing of the Robinson-Huron Treaty.  The political tensions leading up to it reflect ongoing Indigenous concerns around land rights, mineral extraction, and corporate/crown encroachment on traditional territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blockages &amp; Resistance: Studies in Actions of Peace and the Temagami Blackades of 1988-89|last=Hodgins|first=Bruce W.|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=75–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incident ==
In 1849 a group of [[First Nations]] and [[Métis Nation of Ontario|Métis]] people were displeased with ongoing mineral extraction by local mining companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metisnation.org/media/141020/ontario%20report%20-%20michipicoten.pdf|title=Historic Metis in Ontario: Wawa and Environs|last=|first=|date=August 12, 1999|website=Metis Nation of Ontario|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mining was occurring outside of a negotiated treaty and contrary to the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|1763 Royal Proclamation]]'s statements on Indigenous land and resource rights. In November 1849 a group  traveled from [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]] to Mica Bay on the shore of Lake Superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100028974/1100100028976|title=The Robinson Treaties (1850)|last=Branch|first=Government of Canada; Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Communications|website=www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon arrival at Mica Bay the group attacked copper mining sites established by the Quebec Mining Company, with the goal of forcing the Company off the land. Over 100 soldiers were sent to put down the incident and in December a number of the leaders were arrested and detained in Toronto.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saultstar.com/2010/08/13/more-than-150-years-later-natives-still-fighting-for-their-rights|title=More than 150 years later, natives still fighti...|last=nurun.com|website=Sault Star|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the incident included [[Shingwauk|Chief Shingawukonse]] ([[Garden River First Nation]]), Chief Nebenaigoching ([[Batchewana First Nation of Ojibways|Batchewana First Nation]]), Chief Oshawana, Allan Macdonell, Metcalfe, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saultstar.com/2016/09/27/ability-and-merit-determined-algomas-first-judge|title=Prince’s appointment not punishment|last=nurun.com|website=Sault Star|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mica Bay incident is known as the tipping point which forced the government to negotiate treaty agreements with Indigenous communities in the [[Lake Huron]] and Lake Superior region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4592">'''Military fiat''' is a process whereby a decision is made and enforced by [[military]] means without the participation of other political elements. The [[Latin]] term ''fiat'', translated as "let it be," suggests the [[autocracy|autocratic]] attitude ascribed to such a process. For example, many [[coup d'état|coup]]s involve the imposition of a new [[government]] by military fiat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiatpax.net/unisandmil.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of government ==
Historically, military fiat had no relation to particular theories of economics or how to use the power of the state ("[[political science]]"). It was simply seized by the powerful with some support from empowered citizens - typically resulting in a [[monarchy]] where power was passed on to heirs with no public consultation. Over time, this evolved into consultative systems, e.g. of other nobles holding [[fiefdom]]s, e.g. of public in [[parliament]]s. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In [[Democracy|democracies]], however, the [[political parties]] who run for office to represent the public will, must agree to certain guarantees to use power for public good - the relation between military and police powers is clearer but not obvious. In all countries, some fundamental decisions are made by the administration "without the participation of other political elements", and in general the administration of [[money]] has been one of those functions. Public recourse is limited if the state relies on any other nation for major military support, e.g. then-communist [[Poland|Poland's]] and [[East-Germany|East Germany's]] reliance on the [[Soviet Union]]. So "a decision is made and enforced by military means" could be anything done by the administration or bureaucracy as a normal part of its foreign policy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

== Definition of participation ==
Theories vary on how to measure "participation of other political elements." 

In [[economics]], fiat is one of three ways to guarantee the value of money, [[credit money]] and [[commodity money]] being alternatives - but both relying to some degree on the fiat. True [[fiat money]] has no trust or product value of its own, but is backed only by trust in the issuing government and its ability to collect taxes or require conversion of some other resource into currency.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

This view is questioned by some theories of [[political economy]] that argue that there is always some intrinsic reliance on trust, or expectation of the delivery of the commodity itself. Critics of these views argue that withholding taxes in domestic trade or defying powerful nations regarding trade in narcotics or arms will very rapidly prove dangerous or fatal to some of the participants - and, furthermore, that at least some of these decisions are unpopular and are not reflective of the public will. This is a common accusation made by the [[anti-globalization movement]] which argues that governments have been elected on a mandate to oppose global [[free trade]] and instead pursued it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

== Military vs. monetary ==
The use of the military fiat to back economic transactions is what a given theory of [[political economy]] actually justifies, e.g. in the political economy of [[capitalism]], military force is justified by the protection of property rights (which are presumed to optimize economic outcomes). [[Adam Smith]] defined "[[Defense (military)|defense]], infrastructure, justice, education and a stable currency" as the role of government. All defined, in his time, 1776, strictly by a military fiat in most countries, although Britain had a nascent democracy. When the United States broke with the British Empire and its military hegemony in that same year, it was to establish a fiat of its own.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Smith wrote specifically against monetarism, where fiat would be exploited to protect favored industries, monopolize precious metals, and other goals that were not generally shared between the state and the more general public. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The later contributions of [[David Ricardo]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] led to the first theory of (classical) [[political economy]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The '''Missile Technology Control Regime''' ('''MTCR''') is a [[multilateral export control regime]]. It is an informal and voluntary partnership among 35 countries to prevent the [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] of [[missile]] and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] technology capable of carrying above 500&amp;nbsp;kg payload for more than 300&amp;nbsp;km.

==History==
The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) was established in April 1987&lt;ref name="MTCR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtcr.info/english/index.html|title=MTCR Index|website=mtcr.info|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Group of Seven (G7)|G7]] countries: [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States of America]]. The MTCR was created in order to curb the spread of unmanned delivery systems for [[nuclear weapon]]s, specifically delivery systems that could carry a payload of 500&amp;nbsp;kg for a distance of 300&amp;nbsp;km. 

At the annual meeting in [[Oslo]] on 29 June - 2 July 1992, chaired by Mr. [[Sten Lundbo]], it was agreed to expand the scope of the MTCR to include nonproliferation of [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] (UAVs) for all [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Prohibited materials are divided into two Categories, which are outlined in the MTCR Equipment, Software, and Technology Annex. Membership has grown to 35 nations, with India joining on 27th of June 2016 adhering to the MTCR Guidelines unilaterally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/israel/index.html |title=Research Library: Country Profiles: Israel |publisher=NTI |date=2 October 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its establishment, the MTCR has been successful in helping to slow or stop several [[ballistic missile]] programs, according to the Arms Control Association: “Argentina, Egypt, and Iraq abandoned their joint [[Condor II]] ballistic missile program. Brazil and South Africa also shelved or eliminated missile or space launch vehicle programs. Some Eastern European countries, such as Poland and the Czech Republic, destroyed their ballistic missiles, in part, to better their chances of joining MTCR.” In October 1994, in order to make the enforcement of MTCR Guidelines more uniform, the member states established a “no undercut” policy, meaning if one member denies the sale of some technology to another country, then all members must say no.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/mtcr |title=The Missile Technology Control Regime at a Glance |publisher=Arms Control Association |date= |accessdate=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The People's Republic of China is not a member of the MTCR but has agreed to abide by the original 1987 Guidelines and Annex, but not the subsequent revisions. China first verbally pledged that it would adhere to the MTCR in November 1991, and included these assurances in a letter from its Foreign Minister in February 1992. China reiterated its pledge in the October 1994 US-China joint statement.

Some of these countries, with varying degrees of foreign assistance, have deployed [[medium-range ballistic missile]]s that can travel more than 1,000 kilometers and are exploring missiles with much greater ranges, Israel and China in particular having already deployed strategic nuclear SLCMs and ICBMs and satellite launch systems. Some of these countries, which are not MTCR members, are also becoming sellers rather than simply buyers on the global arms market. North Korea, for example, is viewed as the primary source of ballistic missile proliferation in the world today.

In 2002, the MTCR was supplemented by the [[International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation]] (ICOC), also known as the Hague Code of Conduct, which calls for restraint and care in the proliferation of ballistic missile systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction, and has 119 members, thus working parallel to the MTCR with less specific restrictions but with a greater membership.

The '''National Council of Resistance of Iran''' (NCRI; {{lang-fa|شورای ملی مقاومت ایران|Šurā-ye melli-e moqāwemat-e Īrān}}) is an Iranian [[political organization]] based in [[France]].  The organization has appearance of a broad-based coalition, however many analysts consider NCRI and the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] (MEK) to be synonymous,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} taking the former to be an umbrella organization or alias for the latter,&lt;ref name="Katzman2012" &gt;Kenneth Katzman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cfdMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA317    Document No.9 Iran:U.S. Concerns and Policy: Responses, CRS Report RL32048], in Kristen Boon, Aziz Z.

==History==
The NCRI was originally an [[umbrella organization]] of Iranian dissident groups that shared an opposition to [[Ayatollah Khomeni]] and [[Government of Islamic Republic of Iran|Islamic Republic]],&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt; but it lasted no more than two or three years.&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt;

It was formed by [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] (MEK) leader, Massoud Rajavi, and former president of Iran [[Abolhassan Banisadr]] in 1981,&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt; who co-chaired the council.&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt; They were later joined by [[National Democratic Front (Iran)|National Democratic Front]] (NDF) and [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran]] (KDPI).&lt;ref name="Keddie"/&gt; Unlike KDPI, the other leftist major Kurdish opposition [[Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan]] refused to join the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communist and Marxist parties of the world|p=245|publisher=Longman|year=1990|author1=Charles Hobday, Roger East|editor= David Scott Bell|isbn=9780582060388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council also received unequivocal support from the [[Labour Party of Iran]].&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt; It caused a break up in the [[Fedaian Organisation (Minority)]], when [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas (In Search of Identity Program)]] led by Mehdi Sameh split the former in order to join the NCRI, with less than a handful of members.&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt;

Despite presence of well-known personalities such as [[Nasser Pakdaman]], [[Bahman Nirumand]], [[Mehdi Khanbaba Tehrani]], [[Mansour Farhang]] and several others,&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt; the organization was dominated by MEK.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 1983, elements united with NCRI began to depart the alliance because of conflicts with the MEK.&lt;ref name="Terrornomics"&gt;{{citation|title=Terrornomics|editor=David Gold|page=70|isbn=1317045904|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|chapter=An Analysis of the Role of the Iranian Diaspora in the Financial Support System of the ''Mujahedin-e-Khalq''|author=Mark Edmond Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to "violent pro-[[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] activities of [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|MEK]] in the [[Iran–Iraq War]]", the NDF and Banisadr withdrew from the council.&lt;ref name="Keddie"&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran'', (2006), p.253&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March 1983, Banisadr officially left the council.&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt; On 14 April 1985, the KDPI left the organization because they preserved their independence to decide to negotiate with Iran's regime.&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt;

In January 1983, Deputy Prime Minister [[Tariq Aziz]] and NCRI President [[Massoud Rajavi]] signed a peace plan "based on an agreement of mutual recognition of borders as defined by the 1975 Algiers Agreement." According to James Piazza, this peace initiative became the NCRI´s first diplomatic act as a "true government in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Iran's National Security Doctrine|p=88|publisher=Troubador Publishers|year=2013|author=Manshour Varasteh |isbn= 978-1780885575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piazza|first1=James A.|date=October 1994|title=The Democratic Islamic Republic of Iran in Exile|journal=Digest of Middle East Studies|volume=3|issue=4|pages=9–43|doi=10.1111/j.1949-3606.1994.tb00535.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Iran–Iraq War]] the MEK/NCRI formed an alliance with Saddam Hussein, who was largely responsible for its financing, together with Saudi Arabia at that time, though the NCRI also employed fraud to bolster its funding.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Goulka, Lydia Hansell, Elizabeth Wilke, Judith Larson,Rand Corporation 2009 p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;
NCRI was transformed from an umbrella organization into a [[People's Mojahedin of Iran|MEK]] subsidiary {{when|date=June 2018}}`.&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt; Despite being controlled by MEK, the NCRI disguises itself as the "[[Government in exile|parliament-in-exile]]" of the "Iranian Resistance", claiming to fight for the establishment of a democratic and secular republic in Iran, on a platform espousing such political values as secular government, democratic elections, freedom of expression, equal rights for women and human rights.&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt; It still claims to be an umbrella organization with multiple member groups, such as the "Association of Iranian Scholars and Professionals" and the "Association of Iranian Women", which are in fact [[shell organization]]s established by the MEK to make the NCRI appear more "representative".&lt;ref name="Terrornomics"/&gt; Other MEK front organizations include "Muslim Student Association", the "Towhidi Society of Guilds, the "Movement of Muslim Teachers", the "Union of Instructors in Universities and Institutions of Higher Learning", and the "Society for the Defense of Democracy and Independence in Iran".&lt;ref name="Terrornomics"/&gt;

MEK leader [[Maryam Rajavi]] is the designated "president-elect" of the organization, i.e. [[President of Iran]] for the [[Provisional government|transitional period]].&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt;

==Global reception==
Despite NCRI claims, as of 2009, details of the group remained little known in the West, and very few legislators asctively endorsed it. Resurgence of the group's foreignjh fortunes is tethered to the fact that it exposed Iran's nuclear programme in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Rand Corporation 2009 pp.64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCRI is regarded by the Iranian government as a [[terrorist organization]], and was classified as a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|Foreign Terrorist Organisation]] by the [[United States]], alleging that the NCRI "is not a separate organization, but is instead, and has been, an integral part of the MEK at all relevant times" and that the NCRI is "the political branch" of the MEK rather than ''[[vice versa]]''.&lt;ref name="fasfbi"&gt;{{cite web| title =DC Court of Appeals Rules Against NCRI Petition for Review of "Foreign Terrorist Organization" Designation| publisher =[[United States Court of Appeals]], [[District of Columbia]]| date =July 9, 2004| url =http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/mek-usca070904.pdf| format =pdf|accessdate =2006-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is no longer considered terrorist. On September 28, 2012, the US State Department formally removed MEK from its  list of terrorist organizations in a decision made by then-Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], ahead of an October 1 deadline set by a US appeals court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/world/middleeast/iranian-opposition-group-mek-wins-removal-from-us-terrorist-list.html|work=New York Times|first=Scott|last=Shane|title=Iranian Dissidents Convince U.S. to Drop Terror Label|date=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some top US officials{{who|date=December 2016}} such as [[Dick Armey]] (the former House majority leader 1995–2003) have suggested that the State Department wrongly included MEK in the terrorist list from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/op-eds/empowering-the-democratic-opposition-in-iran-2007-07-24.html |title=Empowering the democratic opposition in Iran |work=The Hill |date=July 24, 2007 |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alireza Jafarzadeh]] was its official representative in the US until the Washington office was closed by the US State Department in 2002 on the grounds that it was only a front group for the MEK by then listed as a [[terrorism|terrorist organisation]] in the US.&lt;ref name="glw22feb06"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2006/657/657p16.htm|title=IRAN: US relies on terrorists for nuke 'intelligence'|accessdate=2006-05-01|work=Green Left Weekly|author=Lorimer, Doug|date=February 22, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308093955/http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2006/657/657p16.htm|archivedate=March 8, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that the inclusion of NCRI and MEK in the list was a token offered to the theocratic regime of Iran rather than based the facts of the matter. According to the ''Wall Street Journal''&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{Citation|title=Iranian Imbroglio Gives New Boost To Odd Exile Group|date=2006-11-29|work=Wall Street Journal|author=Andrew Higgins and Jay Solomon}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Senior diplomats in the Clinton administration say the MEK figured prominently as a bargaining chip in a bridge-building effort with Tehran." The Journal added that: In 1997, the State Department added the MEK to a list of global terrorist organizations as "a signal" of the US's desire for rapprochement with Tehran's reformists, said [[Martin Indyk]], who at the time was assistant secretary of state for Near East Affairs. [[President Khatami]]'s government "considered it a pretty big deal," Indyk said.

The [[European Union]] in May 2004 implied that NCRI is part of the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] (rather than vice versa) and excluded the NCRI itself from a list of organisations considered to be terrorist organisations, including the People's Mujahedin of Iran "minus the National Council of Resistance of Iran" on its list of terrorist organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Council Common Position 2004/500/CESP of 17 May 2004| publisher = [[Council of the European Union]]| date =May 17, 2004| url = http://europa.eu/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2004/l_196/l_19620040603en00120016.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2006-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 26, 2009, [[Council of the European Union|EU Council of Ministers]] agreed to remove the MEK from the EU terror list.

A large majority of Iran's population regards it as a terrorist  group, disliking the assistance it provided to Iran's enemy [[Saddam Hussein]] in the  wake of the [[Iraqi invasion of Iran (1980)|Iraqi invasion of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Nicola |last=Pedde|title=Role and evolution of the Mojahedin e-Khalgh |date=2005 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=113–124 |url=https://ojs.uniroma1.it/index.php/vaseteh/article/view/3153/3137}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has an active global network, and engages in propaganda and lobbying in many Western capitals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony H.

The Middle East department of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] (FCO) in the [[United Kingdom]] stated in early 2006 that it is widely understood that "Iran's [nuclear] program, which was kept secret from the [[IAEA]] for 18 years, became public knowledge largely because of revelations of the NCRI, and this led to heightened international concern."&lt;ref name=MediaLine&gt;{{cite web|title=RESISTANCE GROUP CLAIMS EVIDENCE OF IRANIAN BOMB AMBITIONS|url=http://www.themedialine.org/news/print_news_detail.asp?NewsID=12384|publisher=The Media Line|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time [[Michael Axworthy]], former head of the Iran section at the FCO, claimed that the NCRI is a "tightly disciplined [[front organization]] for the MEK and deemed them unreliable."&lt;ref name="axworthy"&gt;{{cite web| last =Kliger| first =Rachelle| title =Resistance group claims evidence of Iranian bomb ambitions| publisher =The Media Line| date =January 11, 2006| url =http://www.nci.org/06nci/01/02.htm| accessdate =2006-12-28| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100119012003/http://www.nci.org/06nci/01/02.htm| archivedate =January 19, 2010| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rand Corporation analysts, the NCRI has hidden the Marxist-Islamic elements in MEK's programme from Western eyes in advancing a secular democratic platform.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Goulka, Lydia Hansell, Elizabeth Wilke, Judith Larson, [https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2009/RAND_MG871.pdf  The Mujahedin-e Khalqin Iraq: A Policy Conundrum,] [[Rand Corporation]] 2009 p.59:'In another survival shift for Rajavi, the NCRI hid the MeK's Marxist-Islamic philosophy from European and American view and instead promoted a new platform espousing such political values as secular government, democratic elections, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, human rights, and a free-market economy, only some of which the MeK had previously endorsed.'&lt;/ref&gt; The NCRI has in the past three decades recorded and reported human rights violations in Iran to UN Special Rapporteurs, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Amnesty International and other international human rights organisations.&lt;ref name="publications.parliament.uk"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmfaff/267/267vw15.htm UK House of Commons, Foreign Affairs Committee publication], 10 June 2013,&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, despite NCRI claims that it espouses equal rights for women, in practice strict gender segregation is practiced in those areas it has controlled, as, for example, at [[Camp Ashraf]].&lt;ref&gt;Rand Corporation 2009 p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

In a meeting at the Council of Europe in April 2006, Maryam Rajavi, President-elect of the NCRI, elaborated on the movement's vision for a future Iran and presented a Ten Point Plan for Future Iran, according to the organisation's website.&lt;ref&gt;NCRI Website: Maryam Rajavi's Ten Point Plan for Future Iran, http://ncr-iran.org/en/ten-point-plan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="publications.parliament.uk"/&gt;

The plan has been supported by British MPs,&lt;ref name="publications.parliament.uk"/&gt; some arguing that it is a potential programme that "would transform Iran" since it calls for the abolition of the death penalty, the creation of a modern legal system and the independence of judges.&lt;ref name="publications.parliament.uk"/&gt;

At a debate on human rights situation in Iran in the House of Lords on December 8, 2016, [[David Alton|Lord Alton of Liverpool]] said, "The manifesto says: Cruel and degrading punishments will have no place in the future Iran". Madam Rajavi would end Tehran's funding of Hamas, Hezbollah and other militant groups and is committed to peaceful coexistence, relations with all countries and respect for the United Nations charter."&lt;ref&gt;House of Lords Hansard Volume 777, Lords Chamber, Iran: Human Rights, 08 December 2016, https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2016-12-08/debates/1117FCF0-EE8C-4A7A-BED2-DE9108AD65DC/IranHumanRights&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''national myth''' is an inspiring [[narrative]] or [[anecdote]] about a [[nation]]'s past. Such [[Mythology|myths]] often serve as an important [[national symbol]] and affirm a set of national [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. A national myth may sometimes take the form of a [[national epic]] or be incorporated into a [[civil religion]].  A group of related myths about a nation may be referred to as the '''national mythos''' from μῦθος the [[wikt:mythos|original Greek word for "myth"]].

A national myth is a legend or fictionalized narrative which has been elevated to a serious [[mythology|mythological]], symbolic, and esteemed level so as to be true to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Ernest Renan |last=Renan |first=Ernest |year=1882 |title=[[:s:fr:Qu’est-ce qu’une nation ?|Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might simply over-dramatize true incidents, omit important historical details, or add details for which there is no evidence; or it might simply be a fictional story that no one takes to be true literally,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Abizadeh |first=Arash |year=2004 |title=Historical Truth, National Myths, and Liberal Democracy |journal=Journal of Political Philosophy |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=291–313 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9760.2004.00201.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; but contains a symbolic meaning for the nation.  The national folklore of many nations includes a [[founding myth]], which may involve a struggle against [[colonialism]] or a [[war of independence (disambiguation)|war of independence]].  In many cases, the meaning of the national myth is disputed among different parts of the population.

In some places, the national myth may be [[spirituality|spiritual]] in tone and refer to stories of the nation's founding at the hands of a [[God]], several [[gods]], leaders favored by gods, and other supernatural beings.

National myths serve many social and political purposes. National myths often exist only for the purpose of state-sponsored [[propaganda]]. In [[totalitarian]] [[dictatorship]]s, the leader might be given, for example, a mythical supernatural life history in order to make him or her seem god-like and supra-powerful (see also [[cult of personality]]). However, national myths exist in every society. In [[Liberalism|liberal]] regimes they can serve the purpose of inspiring civic virtue and self-sacrifice (Miller 1995), or of consolidating the power of dominant groups and legitimizing their rule.

== Background ==

National myths have been created and propagated by national [[intellectuals]], who have used them as instruments of political mobilization on demographic bases such as [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Safty  |first=Adel |authorlink= |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Leadership and Conflict Resolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAMntG01-lwC&amp;pg=PA273 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |year=2002 |publisher= Universal publishers |location= USA |language= |isbn=1-58112-617-4 |oclc= |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=273 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= Shnirelman (1995) considers nationalist myths ... created by national intellectuals and propagated by the intelligentsia with the aim of using this myths as an instrument of ethno-political mobilization under interethnic conflicts. |laysummary= |laydate=|postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social background ===

The concept of [[national identity]] is inescapably connected with myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cameron  |first=Keith  |authorlink= |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=National identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aL2VArrJnzcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22nationalistic+myths%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=i0dhTsHoOcbY4QTfgbVQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nationalistic%20myths%22&amp;f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |year=1999 |publisher= Intellect|location=Exeter, England |language= |isbn=978-1-871516-05-0 |oclc=40798482 |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=4 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= Myth is inextricably linked with the concept of national identity |laysummary= |laydate=|postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex of myths is at the core of every ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=J.

All modern national identities were preceded by nationalist movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Østergaard|first=Uffe|title=Classical and modern social theory|year=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass.|isbn=978-0-631-21288-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PeGtsC2Hp4C&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=nationalist+myths+first+emerged+%22national+movements%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VG9oTvuLEYWe-QbzkcjiCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nationalist%20myths%20first%20emerged%20%22national%20movements%22&amp;f=false|author2=Heine Andersen |author3=Lars Bo Kaspersen |accessdate=8 September 2011|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "nation" was used in the [[Middle Ages]], it had totally different meaning than in the age of nationalism, where it was linked to the efforts aimed to creation of the [[nation-state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Østergaard|first=Uffe|title=Classical and modern social theory|year=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass.|isbn=978-0-631-21288-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PeGtsC2Hp4C&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=nationalist+myths+first+emerged+%22national+movements%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VG9oTvuLEYWe-QbzkcjiCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nationalist%20myths%20first%20emerged%20%22national%20movements%22&amp;f=false|author2=Heine Andersen |author3=Lars Bo Kaspersen |accessdate=8 September 2011|quote= We can, for example, certainly encounter term "nation" in the Middle Ages, but the word meant something completely different than in the age of nationalism, where it is inextricably linked with the efforts to create an associated state.|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological background ===

Besides their social background, nationalist myths have also a [[Psychology|psychological]] explanation which is connected with nationalist myth of stable [[homeland]] community. The [[complexity]] of relations with the modern external world and incoherence of the inner psychological world can result with anxiety which is reduced by static self-labelling and self-construction and gaining an imaginary emotion of stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Brown  |first=David |authorlink= |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Contemporary nationalism: civic, ethnocultural, and multicultural politics |url=  |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London ; New York |language= |isbn=0-203-38025-8 |oclc= 43286590 |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=24 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= Contemporary nationalism |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=uUPt5HiudwAC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=%22nationalist+myth+is%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Qw1iTqOBPK3a4QTZitWPCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nationalist%20myth%20is%22&amp;f=false|quote= |laysummary= |laydate=|postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary myths ==

Two of nationalism's primary myths are connected with beliefs in:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Brown  |first=David  |authorlink= |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Contemporary nationalism: civic, ethnocultural, and multicultural politics |url=  |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London ; New York |language= |isbn=0-203-38025-8 |oclc= 43286590 |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |pages=23, 24 |nopp= |at= |chapter= Contemporary nationalism |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=uUPt5HiudwAC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=%22nationalist+myth+is%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Qw1iTqOBPK3a4QTZitWPCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nationalist%20myth%20is%22&amp;f=false|quote= |laysummary= |laydate=|postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''community's permanence'' (the myth of the eternal nation), based on its national character, territory and institutions and on its continuity across many generations, and
# ''community's common ancestry'' (myth of the common ancestry).

The nationalist myths portray the [[nation]] as sleeping and waiting to be awakened, but scholarly discourse avoids such images because [[national identity]] either exists or not and can not be asleep and awakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Danforth|first=Loring|title=The Macedonian conflict : ethnic nationalism in a transnational world|year=1995|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|accessdate=8 September 2011|page=15|quote=.. nationalist myths of nation waiting, Sleeping Beauty like, to be awakened....In scholarly discourse this image should be avoided .. national identity is a matter of self-ascription, it either exists or it does not, it can not be asleep and then be awakened...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nobel Peace Center''' ({{lang-no|Nobels Fredssenter}}) in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] is a showcase for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] and the ideals it represents. The Center is also an arena where culture and politics merge to promote involvement, debate and reflection around topics such as war, peace and conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Gunnar Arntzen [http://www.snl.no/Nobels_fredssenter ''Nobels Fredssenter'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Nobel Peace Center.JPG|right|thumb|250 px|Nobel Peace Center entrance]]
The Nobel Peace Center was opened in 2005 by His Majesty King [[Harald V of Norway]] in a ceremony attended by the royal families of Norway and Sweden. Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Wangari Maathai]] was also present. The Center has since welcomed more than 400,000 visitors (as of 1 October 2009). The Nobel Peace Center is located in the former [[Oslo Vestbanestasjon]] (Oslo West railway station) building. Dating from 1872, the former station building was drawn by architect [[Georg Andreas Bull]]. It ceased to be used as a railway station in 1989. It is overlooking the harbor and located close to the [[Oslo City Hall]] where the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Award Ceremony takes place every 10 December, to commemorate Alfred Nobel’s death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norway.org/ARCHIVE/policy/peace/peacecenter/ ''Nobel Peace Center Opens in Oslo'' (Royal Norwegian Embassy in Washington)]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    http://www.artemisia.no/arc/arkitekter/norge/bull.georg.html|title=  Arkitekter:Georg Andreas Bull (1829-1917) |publisher= artemisia.no|author= Geir Tandberg Steigan |accessdate= November  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British architect [[David Adjaye]] is responsible for the Center’s creative design, including its color schemes; the American designer David Small developed its hi-tech installations. The Nobel Peace Center is financed by the Norwegian Ministry of Culture, private sponsors and admission fees. Temporary exhibitions are fully sponsored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelpeacecenter/ ''Nobel Peace Center'' (Nobelprize.org)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center presents the Nobel Peace Prize laureates and their work, in addition to telling the story of  [[Alfred Nobel]]  and the other Nobel prizes. This is done using multimedia and interactive technology, exhibitions, meetings, debates, theater, concerts and conferences, as well as a broad educational program and regular guided tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.frommers.com/destinations/oslo/attractions/nobel-peace-center 
|title=   Nobel Peace Center |publisher= FrommerMedia LLC|accessdate= November  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobel Peace Center is a foundation and part of a network of Nobel institutions represented externally by the [[Nobel Foundation]], which also administers informational activities and arrangements surrounding the presentation of the Nobel Prize. [[Bente Erichsen]] is director of the Nobel Peace Center. [[Geir Lundestad]] is chairman of the Center’s board, which is appointed by the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]].

[[Electric meter]]s with NILM technology are used by utility companies to survey the specific uses of electric power in different homes. NILM is considered a low-cost alternative to attaching individual monitors on each appliance. It does, however, present privacy concerns.

==Background and theory==
Nonintrusive load monitoring was invented by [[George W. Hart]], Ed Kern and Fred Schweppe of [[MIT]] in the early 1980s with funding from the [[Electric Power Research Institute]].&lt;ref name="hart"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = G. W. | authorlink = George W. Hart| title = Residential energy monitoring and computerized surveillance via utility power flows | doi = 10.1109/44.31557 | journal = IEEE Technology and Society Magazine | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 12–16 | year = 1989 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgehart.com/research/nalmrefs.html NALM bibliography 1980–1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NILM fig 1.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 1 from US patent 4858141 showing basic process for NILM]]
The basic process is described in {{US patent|4858141}}. As shown in figure 1 from the patent, a digital AC monitor is attached to the single-phase power going into a residence.  Changes in the voltage and current are measured (i.e. admittance measurement unit), normalized (scaler) and recorded (net change detector unit). A [[cluster analysis]] is then performed to identify when different appliances are turned on and off. If a 60-watt bulb is turned on, for example, followed by a 100-watt bulb being turned on, followed by the 60-watt bulb being turned off followed by the 100-watt bulb being turned off, the NIALM unit will match the on and off signals from the 60-watt bulb and the on and off signals from the 100-watt bulb to determine how much power was used by each bulb and when. The system is sufficiently sensitive that individual 60-watt bulbs can be discriminated due to the normal variations in actual power draw of bulbs with the same nominal rating (e.g. one bulb might draw 61 watts, another 62 watts).

[[Image:NILM fig 8.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 8 from US patent 4858141 showing how differences in reactive power can help distinguish one appliance from another]]
The system can measure both [[reactive power]] and [[real power]]. Hence two appliances with the same total power draw can be distinguished by differences in their [[complex impedance]]. As shown in figure 8 from the patent, for example, a refrigerator electric motor and a pure resistive heater can be distinguished in part because the electric motor has significant changes in reactive power when it turns on and off, whereas the heater has almost none.

NILM systems can also identify appliances with a series of individual changes in power draw.  These appliances are modeled as [[finite state machines]]. A dishwasher, for example, has heaters and motors that turn on and off during a typical dish washing cycle. These will be identified as clusters, and power draw for the entire cluster will be recorded. Hence “dishwasher” power draw can be identified as opposed to “resistor heating unit” and “electric motor”.

==Privacy concerns==
NILM can detect what types of appliances people have and their behavioral patterns. Patterns of energy use may indicate behavior patterns, such as routine times that nobody is at home, or embarrassing or illegal behavior of residents. It could, for example, reveal when the occupants of a house are using the shower, or when individual lights are turned on and off.&lt;ref name="hart" /&gt;

If the NILM is running remotely at a utility or by a third party, the homeowner may not know that their behavior is being monitored and recorded. 

A stand-alone in-home system, under the control of the user, can provide feedback about energy use, without revealing information to others. Drawing links between their behavior and energy consumption may help reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency, flatten peak loads, save money, or balance appliance use with green energy availability. However the use of a stand-alone system does not protect one from remote monitoring.

The accuracy and capability of this technology is still developing and is not 100% reliable in near-real-time, such that complete information is accumulated and analyzed over periods ranging from minutes to hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11449">'''Nínive Clements Calegari''' is an educator in the [[United States]]. Following ten years of classroom experience in public schools, she became an author and founded a national literacy program, [[826 National]]. She also founded [[The Teacher Salary Project]]. Currently she is the CEO of Enterprise for Youth, a job readiness program serving youth all around the Bay Area.    

==Biography==
Calegari went to [[Santa Catalina School]] and graduated in 1989,  later going to [[Middlebury College]] to receive her bachelor's degree in 1993 and a Masters in Teaching and Curriculum from the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.santacatalina.org/upper-school/alumnae/distinguished-alumna-award|title=Distinguished Alumna Award|work=Santa Catalina School web site|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She worked at [[Leadership High School]], [[San Francisco]]'s first charter school, where she also served on the Board of Directors, and then taught in her family's hometown in [[Mexico]].

Calegari was a co-founder of [[826 Valencia]] in April 2002 and the founding executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.826national.org/about/19/staff|title=About 826 National|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|work=826 National web site|archivedate=April 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427065147/http://www.826national.org/about/19/staff|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The group and the seven other related chapters of [[826 National]] (which she also co-founded and headed) are a group of non-profit writing centers for students ages 6–18.

Calegari, along with [[Dave Eggers]] and Daniel Moulthrop, co-authored the book ''Teachers Have It Easy: The Big Sacrifices and Small Salaries of America's Teachers'', published by [[The New Press]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenewpress.com/books/teachers-have-it-easy|title=Teachers Have it Easy|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|work=The New Press web site|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that increasing teachers' salaries is a critical part of meaningful school reform, and essential to ensuring US students receive education from quality teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/23/AR2005062301562_pf.html|title=Unsung Heroes|first=|date=June 26, 2005|work=|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|via=|author=Rafe Esquith|accessdate=October 10, 2016}} Book Review of ''Teachers Have It Easy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calegari founded and serves as CEO of [[The Teacher Salary Project]], a non-profit designed to build the political will necessary to transform how US society values effective teachers.&lt;ref name="salary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachersalaryproject.org/american-teacher-the-movie|title=The Teacher Salary Project|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|work=American Teacher: about the film|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project uses [[film]], [[social media]], and the general public to communicate its mission. The Teacher Salary Project's film, ''American Teacher'', held its first preview screening in May 2011 at the San Francisco International Film Festival. It was also featured in numerous other film festivals, including the United Nations Association Film Festival and Philadelphia International Film Festival.&lt;ref name="salary"/&gt; The film was produced by Calegari and Eggers, and directed and produced by filmmaker [[Vanessa Roth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/a-movie-that-tells-a-real-story-of-american-teachers/2011/05/31/AG7UYtFH_blog.html|title=A movie that tells a real story of American teachers|first=|date=June 1, 2011|work=|newspaper=Washington Post|via=|author=Michael Alison Chandler|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film is narrated by actor [[Matt Damon]] with music composed by San Francisco musician [[Thao Nguyen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebaybridged.com/2011/09/07/thao-nguyen-scores-a-documentary-about-the-national-education-crisis-through-the-eyes-of-the-teachers/|title=Thao Nguyen scores ‘American Teacher,’ a documentary about the national education crisis through the eyes of the teachers|last=Gazdowicz|first=Anna|date=September 7, 2011|website=The Bay Bridged|publisher=|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People become Pashtunized when they settle in [[Pashtunistan|Pashtun-dominated areas]] and adopt [[Pashtun culture]],&lt;ref name=Banting/&gt; either by adapting the [[Pashto language]] or absorbing [[Pashtunwali]] customs. Pashtunization is a specific form of [[cultural assimilation]] and has been taking place in Pashtun-populated regions of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] for several centuries.

The [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]] were originally [[Turkic tribes]] who had long domiciled in Afghanistan and gradually adopted the [[Pashtun culture]].

==Academic preparation==
Torres's academic background includes studies in [[Cultural Anthropology]], Puerto Rican studies, [[Art]] and [[Latin American studies]]. Torres graduated from [[Rutgers University]], the State University of New Jersey at Livingston College in June 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taino-tribe.org/diplo.htm ''A Taino Indian Graduates From Rutgers University, The Newark Star Ledger Newspaper: "A Cap Of A Different Color" ''] Retrieved 31 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural activism==
In the late 1960s and early 1970s Torres did research aimed at documenting [[Taino]] artifacts and history through the [[Institute of Puerto Rican Culture|CPI]] Comite Pro Indigenismo. In the mid 1970s Torres had translated the very first theater script from the Spanish language to the Taino language as a former Actor and member of El Grupo Guazabara (The Guazabara Theater Group). In 1993 he founded the Taino Inter-Tribal Council (TITC, Inc.), a not-for-profit Taino cultural-educational organization. He worked at various archaeological sites, including Puerto De Tierra in the 1970s. For over five (5) decades and many years, Torres has advocated the reclaiming and repatriation of artifacts pertaining to the past Pre-Columbian historical territory of the principal regional Chief [[Orocobix]] of the Jatibonicu Taino tribe, a tribe located in the central mountain region of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taino-tribe.org/t-exhibit.htm ''1973 Pre-Columbian Taino Art Exhibit "Our Profound Taino Roots." '' Retrieved 31 March 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; It should be mentioned that Torres is credited and recognized as being a Taino Native Civil Rights activist and one of the original founding Fathers of the 1968 Taino Indian Movement of Puerto Rico.

He is an activist for the official government recognition of the Taino American Indian people and his Jatibonicu Taino tribal community of Puerto Rico and in New Jersey. As tribal leader, Torres is politically active in Taino tribal council government, national and international political affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taino-tribe.org ''Tribal Government of the Jatibonicu Taino People of Puerto Rico.''] Retrieved 19 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often known as Don Pedro or [[Tribal chief|Chief]] Guanikeyu, in 1996 Torres called for the "Taino national unity of all the Taino Indian people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/Taino/docs/call.html ''A call for Taino national unity: from the great grandson of Chief Orocobix, and tribal Elder of the District of Jatibonicu.''] Retrieved 19 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Torres represented the Jatibonicu Taino Tribal Nation before the U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taino-tribe.org/us-census.html ''A Taino Tribal Leader Meets With Heads of US Census.''] Retrieved 19 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his Taino tribal activism he has written various papers and articles on the relevancy of Taino culture and the history of Tainos in Puerto Rico, Florida and adjacent areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elyunque.com/Taino.htm ''PUERTO RICO HISTORY THE TAINO PEOPLE.''] Retrieved 19 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Torres also performed as a Taino language teacher and researcher. As a tribal leader, he conducted the traditional Taino Guatiao (naming ceremony) and has bestowed the Taino name on many modern Taino people today. He also promoted the Taino language when he was chosen to name a crater on planet Venus that he named Nanichi "My Love or My Heart" in the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/4140?__fsk=-1932054963 ''The Naming of Crater "Nanichi" that was approved and adopted by the International body of the IAU in 2000.''] Retrieved 23 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resignation and subsequent return==
Due to failing health, in 2001, Guanikeyu Torres withdrew from the leading role of his Taino tribal community and assumed the post of tribal elder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/41/274.html ''My Fairwell Letter To The Taino People in the Year 2001.''] World History archives: The contemporary political history of the Taino in general. 1 January 2001.

The '''Presidency of Thabo Mbeki''' began on 14 June 1999, when [[Thabo Mbeki]] became then second [[President of South Africa]]. Mbeki an [[African National Congress]] (ANC) member who had previously been the [[Deputy President of South Africa]] defeated [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA) presidentian, [[Tony Leon]] in the [[South African general election, 1999]]. Mbeki's running mate [[Jacob Zuma]] became the [[Deputy President]] that same day.

==Inauguration==
Mbeki's [[Inauguration]] was held on 6 June 1999, at the [[Union Buildings]] in [[Pretoria]]. Mbeki was sworn in as president by [[Chief Justice of South Africa]], [[Arthur Chasckalon]].

During his inaugural speech Mbeki said the following:
{{quote|As the sun continues to rise to banish the darkness of the long years of [[colonialism]] and [[apartheid]], what the new light over our land must show is a nation diligently at work to create a better life for itself.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39485">'''Proletarian literature''' refers here to the literature created by [[working-class]] writers mainly for the [[class-consciousness|class-conscious]] [[proletariat]]. Though the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' states that because it "is essentially an intended device of revolution", it is therefore often published by the [[Communist Party]] or left wing sympathizers,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421071/novel&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; the proletarian novel has also been categorized without any emphasis on revolution, as a novel "about the working classes and working-class life; perhaps with the intention of making propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Criticism''. (London: Penguin Books, 1999, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; This different emphasis may reflect a difference between Russian, American and other traditions of working-class writing, with that of Britain. The British tradition was not especially inspired by the Communist Party, but had its roots in the [[Chartist movement]], and [[socialism]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hayward, ''Working-Class Fiction: from Chartism to ''Trainspotting''. (London: Northcote House, 1997), pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, writing about the British working-class writers, H Gustav Klaus, in ''The Socialist Novel: Towards the Recovery of a Tradition'' (1982) suggested that "the once current [term] 'proletarian' is, internationally, on the retreat, while the competing concepts of 'working-class' and 'socialist' continue to command about equal adherence".&lt;ref&gt;Brighton: Harvest Press, 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word proletarian is also used to describe works about the working class by working-class authors, to distinguish them from works by middle-class authors such as [[Charles Dickens]] (''[[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]]''), [[John Steinbeck]] (''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''), and [[Henry Green]] (''[[Living (novel)|Living]]'').&lt;ref name="Fordham-p71"&gt;John Fordham, "'A Strange Field’: Region and Class in the Novels of Harold Heslop" in ''Intermodernism: Literary Culture in Mid-Twentieth-Century Britain'', ed. Kristin Bluemel. Published 2009 :Edinburgh University Press, note no.1, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, though some of poet [[William Blake]]'s (1757–1827) works are early examples of working-class literature, including the two "The Chimney Sweeper" poems, published in ''[[Songs of Innocence]]'' in 1789 and ''[[Songs of Experience]]'' in 1794, which deal with the subject of child labour,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://asms.k12.ar.us/classes/humanities/britlit/97-98/blake/POEMS.htm William Blake Page]", The Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, &amp; the Arts&lt;/ref&gt; Blake, whose father was a tradesman, was not a proletarian writer.

==Proletarian novel==
The [[proletariat]] are members of the [[working class]]. The proletarian novel is a subgenre of the [[novel]], written by workers mainly for other workers. It overlaps and sometimes is synonymous with the working-class novel,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gustav Klaus, ''The Socialist Novel in Britain: Towards the Recovery of a Tradition''. ( Brighton: Harvester Press, 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; socialist novel,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gustav Klaus.&lt;/ref&gt; [[social problem novel]] (also problem novel or sociological novel or [[social novel]]),&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook to Literature'' 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1996), p.487; "social problem novel." ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 02 Nov. 2012. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/664323/social-problem-novel]&lt;/ref&gt; propaganda or thesis novel,&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon (revised C. E. Preston), ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory''. (London: Penguin, 1999), pp. 704, 913&lt;/ref&gt; and [[socialist realism]] novel.

The proletarian novel may [[Political commentary|comment]] on [[political]] events, systems and theories, and is frequently seen as an instrument to promote social reform or political revolution among the working classes. Proletarian literature is created especially by [[communist]], [[socialist]] and [[anarchist]] authors. It is about the lives of poor, and the period 1930 to 1945 in particular produced many such novels. However, there were works before and after these dates. In Britain the term [[working class]] literature, novel ''etc''. is more generally used. The intention of the writers of proletarian literature is to lift the workers from the slums, by inspiring them to embrace the possibilities of social change or a political revolution. As such it is a form of [[political fiction]].

==United States==
The most important American working-class writers gathered in the First American Writers Congress of 1935. The [[League of American Writers]] was backed by the [[Communist Party USA]]. Among the famous international writers who attended the Congress were Georg Fink (pseudonym of the German writer [[:de:Kurt Münzer|Kurt Münzer]]), [[Mike Gold]] of New York (both of whom were Jewish), [[José Revueltas]] of Mexico,  [[:es:Nicomedes Guzmán|Nicomedes Guzmán]] of Chile, [[Jorge Icaza Coronel|Jorge Icaza]] of Ecuador, and numerous others.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In the United States, [[Mike Gold]], author of  ''[[Jews Without Money]]'', was the first to promote proletarian literature in [[Max Eastman]]'s magazine ''[[The Liberator (magazine)|The Liberator]]'' and later in ''[[The New Masses]]''. The Communist party newspaper, ''[[The Daily Worker]]'' also published some literature, as did numerous other magazines, including ''The Anvil'', edited by [[Jack Conroy]], ''Blast'', and ''[[Partisan Review]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Other examples of American proletarian writing include [[B. Traven]], ''[[The Death Ship]]'' (1926) (though it is presumed that Traven was born in Germany); [[Agnes Smedley]], ''[[Daughter of Earth]]'' (1929); [[Edward Dahlberg]], ''Bottom Dogs'' (1929);  [[Jack Conroy]], ''[[The Disinherited]]'' (1933); [[James T. Farrell]], ''[[Studs Lonigan]]'' (a trilogy, 1932-5); [[Robert Cantwell]], ''The Land of Plenty'' (1934); [[Henry Roth]], ''[[Call It Sleep]]'' (1934); [[Meridel Le Sueur]], ''Salute to Spring'' (1940) and [[Tillie Olsen]], ''[[Yonnondio: From the Thirties|Yonnondio]]'' (1930s, published 1974).

Writers like [[John Steinbeck]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], and [[John Dos Passos]], who wrote about the working class, but who came from more well-to-do backgrounds, are not included here.

==Soviet Russia==
An important movement In the first years of the [[Russian Revolution]], [[Proletkult]], was an effort to encourage literacy. This was something quite different from the later, traditional and realist proletarian novel of the [[Stalin]] years.

In the 1930s [[Socialist realism]] became the predominant trend in Russia. Its leading figure was [[Maxim Gorky]], who had laid the foundations of this style with his works ''[[The Mother (1906 novel)|The Mother]]'' and his play ''The Enemies'' (both 1906). Gorky described the lives of people in the lowest strata and on the margins of society, revealing their hardships, humiliations, and brutalization.&lt;ref name="kirjasto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/gorki.htm |title=Maxim Gorky |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706084924/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/gorki.htm |archivedate=6 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not come from a working-class family and neither did another prominent writer in the early years after the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, [[Alexander Ostrovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;"Maxim Gorky", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' http://www.britannica.com/biography/Maksim-Gorky&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Revyakin&lt; A.I. A.N. Ostrovsky. Life and Works. Moscow, 1949, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Nikolay Ostrovsky]] is an important writer, of the early Soviet era, from a working-class family. His novel ''[[How the Steel Was Tempered]]'' (1932) has been among the most successful works of [[Russian literature]], with tens of millions of copies printed in many languages around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/e2008/e200804/p28.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="compuart"&gt;http://www.compuart.ru/article.aspx?id=8496&amp;iid=346&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a fictionalized autobiography of Ostrovsky's life, who had a difficult working-class childhood and became a [[Komsomol]] member in July 1919 and went to the front as a volunteer. The novel's protagonist, Pavel Korchagin, represented the "young hero" of Russian literature: he is dedicated to his political causes, which help him to overcome his tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;Soviet literature: problems and people K. Zelinsky, Progress Publishers. Moscow. 1970. p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonid Leonov]]  (1899 — 1994) was a Soviet novelist and playwright. His novel ''The Russian Forest'' (1953) was acclaimed by the authorities as a model Soviet book on [[World War II]] and received the [[Lenin Prize]], but its implication that the Soviet regime had cut down "the symbol of Old Russian culture" caused some nervousness, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] reminded the author that "not all trees are useful ... from time to time the forest must be thinned."&lt;ref&gt;James H. Billington, ''The Icon and the Axe: An Interpretive History of Russian Culture'' (Knopf, 1966), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==

===19th century===
[[Image:Tressell.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Tressell banner]]
Poet [[John Clare]] (1793–1864) was an important early British working-class writer. Clare was the son of a farm labourer, and came to be known for his celebratory representations of the English countryside and his lamentation of its disruption.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Summerfield, in introduction to ''John Clare: Selected Poems'', Penguin Books 1990, pp 13–22.  {{ISBN|0-14-043724-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His poetry underwent a major re-evaluation in the late 20th century and he is now considered to be among the most important 19th-century poets.&lt;ref&gt;Sales, Roger  (2002) ''John Clare: A Literary Life''; Palgrave Macmillan {{ISBN|0-333-65270-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His biographer [[Jonathan Bate]] states that Clare was "the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bate, John Clare: A biography; Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] example of a working-class novel is [[Chartism|chartist]] Thomas Martin Wheeler's ''Sunshine and Shadows'', which was serialized in the ''Northern Star'' 1849-50.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Haywood, ''Working-Class Fiction: from Chartism to 'Trainspotting' ''. (Plymouth: Nortcote House, 1997), p7&lt;/ref&gt; Another chartist writer was the shoemaker poet [[Thomas Cooper (poet)|Thomas Cooper]], who, while in prison for making an inflammatory speech, "followed in the footsteps of [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]] and other radicals and wrote imaginatively about the themes of oppression and emancipation".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Haywood, ''Working-Class Fiction'', pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[Walter Greenwood]]'s ''[[Love on the Dole]]'' (1933) has been described as an "excellent example" of an English proletarian novel.&lt;ref&gt;J. A Cuddon, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; It was written during the early 1930s as a response to the crisis of unemployment, which was being felt locally, nationally, and internationally. It is set in Hanky Park, the industrial slum in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] where Greenwood was born and brought up. The story begins around the time of the [[General Strike]] of 1926, but its main action takes place in 1931.

Several working-class writers  wrote about their experience of life in the [[merchant navy]], including  [[James Hanley (novelist)|James Hanley]], [[Jim Phelan (Irish writer)|Jim Phelan]], [[George Garrett (activist)|George Garrett]], and [[John Sommerfield]]. Liverpool-Irish writer James Hanley wrote a number of works based on his experiences at sea as well as a member of a working-class seafaring family. An early example is the novella ''The Last Voyage'' (1931), in which stoker John Reilly, who is still working only because he lied about his age, now faces his last voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Reilly is in his mid-sixties he has a young family, who will have to live in future on his inadequate pension.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In another sense this is Reilly's last voyage, because despairing of the future he throws himself into the ship’s furnace: “Saw all his life illuminated in those flames. ‘Not much for us. Sweat, sweat. Pay off. Sign on. Sweat, sweat. Pay off. Finish. Ah, well!’”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Binding, "Man Against Fate", a review of James Hanley's ''Last Voyage and Other Stories''. ''Times Literary Supplement'', 5 December 1997, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Last Voyage and Other Stories'' (London: Harvill Press, 1997, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other works by Hanley are ''[[Boy (novel)|Boy]]'' (1931) and ''[[The Furys Chronicle|The Furys]]'' (1935).

There were a number of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] writers who wrote works based on their experiences as coal miners, including novelist (and playwright) [[Jack Jones (novelist)|Jack Jones]] (1884–1970), novelists [[Gwyn Thomas (novelist)|Gwyn Thomas]] (1913–1981). [[Lewis Jones (writer)|Lewis Jones]] (1897–1939), and [[Gwyn Jones (author)|Gwyn Jones]] (1907–1999), and poet [[Idris Davies]] (1905–53). Jack Jones was a miner's son from [[Merthyr Tydfil]] who was himself a miner from the age of 12. He was active in the union movement and politics, starting with the [[CPGB|Communist Party]], but in the course of his life he was involved, to some degree, with all the major British parties. Amongst his novels of working-class life are ''[[Rhondda Roundabout]]'' (1935) and ''Bidden to the Feast'' (1938). The political development of a young miner is the subject of ''Cwmardy'' (1937), [[Lewis Jones (writer)|Lewis Jones]]'s (1897–1939) largely autobiographical novel. [[Gwyn Thomas (novelist)|Gwyn Thomas]] (1913–81) was also a coalminer's son from the Rhondda, but won a scholarship to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and then became a schoolmaster. He wrote 11 novels as well as short stories, plays, and radio and television scripts, most of which focused on unemployment in the [[Rhondda Valley]] in the 1930s. Thomas's first accepted book was a collection of short stories, ''Where Did I Put My Pity: Folk-Tales From the Modern Welsh'', which appeared in 1946. Another writer who escaped from his proletarian background was [[Gwyn Jones (author)|Gwyn Jones]] (1907–1999). He wrote about this world in novels and short stories, including ''Times Like These'' (1936) which explores the life of a working-class family during the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 miners' strike]]. The mining valleys produced a significant working-class poet in [[Idris Davies]] (1905–53), who worked as a coal miner before qualifying as a teacher. He initially wrote in Welsh "but rebellion against chapel religion", along with the "inspirational influence of English" poets, led him to write in English. ''Gwalia Deserta'' (1938) is about the [[Great Depression]], while the subject of ''The Angry Summer'' (1943) is the 1926 miners' strike. [[Rhys Davies (writer)|Rhys Davies]], author of ''A Time To Laugh'' (1937), and [[Menna Gallie]], author of ''Strike for a Kingdom'' (1959) and ''The Small Mine'' (1962), while not working class, also wrote about life in the mining valleys of [[South Wales]]. [[Harold Heslop]], author of the novel ''The Earth Beneath'' (1946) was another coal miner, but from the north-east of [[England]], as was [[Sid Chaplin]], who wrote ''The Thin Seam'' (1949).

Both [[Alan Sillitoe]], ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'' (1958) and [[Stan Barstow]], ''[[A Kind of Loving]]'' (1960), were working class writers associated with the so-called [[Angry young men]]; they were also linked with [[Kitchen sink realism]], a literary movement that used a style of social realism. This often depicted the domestic situations of working class Britons living in cramped rented accommodation and spending their off-hours drinking in grimy pubs, to explore social issues and political controversies. However, some of the writers also associated with these two movements, like [[John Osborne]] and [[John Braine]], did not come from the working-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heilpern|2006|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Braine "John Braine", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' ;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some other important twentieth-century British working class novelists and novels: [[Robert Tressell]], ''[[The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists]]'' (1914); [[James C. Welsh]], ''The Underworld'' (1920); [[Ethel Carnie Holdsworth]], ''This Slavery'' (1925); [[Ellen Wilkinson]], ''[[Clash (novel)|Clash]]'' (1929);  [[Lewis Grassic Gibbon]] ''[[A Scots Quair]]'' (trilogy, 1932-4); [[Barry Hines]], ''[[A Kestrel for a Knave]]'' (1968); [[William McIlvanney]], ''[[Docherty (novel)|Docherty]]'' (1975); [[Pat Barker]], ''[[Union Street (book)|Union Street]]'' (1982); [[James Kelman]], ''[[The Busconductor Hines]]'' (1984); [[Irvine Welsh]], ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Haywood, ''Working-Class Fiction'', pp. 170–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Bond]] is an important working-class dramatist and his play ''[[Saved (play)|Saved]]'' (1965) became one of the best known [[cause célèbre]]s in 20th century British theatre history. ''Saved'' delves into the lives of a selection of South London working class youths suppressed – as Bond would see it – by a brutal economic system and unable to give their lives meaning, who drift eventually into barbarous mutual violence.&lt;ref&gt;''Saved'', Student Edition, with Commentary and Notes by David Davis, London, Methuen Drama, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
Two leading French writers who were born into the working class were [[Jean Giono]] (1895–1970) and [[Henry Poulaille]] (1896–1980).

[[Jean Giono]] was the son of a cobbler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daudin|first1=Claire|title=Jean Giono, "Colline"|date=1999|publisher=Bréal|location=Rosny|page=17|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=-d-pH8ZRQIoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  a laundry woman, who spent most of his life in [[Manosque]], [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]]. He was a voracious reader but had to leave school at sixteen to work in a bank to help support his family. He published his first novel ''Colline'' in 1929, which won him the [[Prix Brentano]] and $1000, and an English translation of the book,&lt;ref name=fay&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fay|first=Eliot G.|year=1930|title=Prix Brentano|journal=[[The French Review]]|volume=3|issue=3|pages=169–73|jstor=380090}}&lt;/ref&gt; he left the bank in 1930 to devote himself to writing on a full-time basis.&lt;ref name="alalettre1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alalettre.com/giono-bio.php |title=Jean Giono (Biographie) |publisher=aLaLettre |date= |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novels Giono published during the nineteen-thirties are set in [[Provence]], with peasants as protagonists, and displaying a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref name="infinit1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.infinit.net/poibru/giono/gionobib.htm |title=Jean Giono: bibliographie |publisher=Pages.infinit.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Pagnol]] based three of his films on Giono's work of this period: ''Regain'', with [[Fernandel]] and music by [[Honegger]], ''Angèle'', and ''La Femme du boulanger'', with [[Raimu]].&lt;ref name="infinit1"/&gt;

After World War II he planned on writing a sequence of ten novels inspired by [[Balzac]]’s [[La Comédie humaine]], in which he would depict characters from all strata of society rather than peasants, and contrast different moments in history by depicting the experiences of members of the same family a hundred years apart. But Giono only completed the four Hussard novels, ''Mort d’un personnage'' (1948)), ''Le Hussard sur le Toit'' (1951), ''Le Bonheur fou'' (1957),  ''Angelo'' (1958).&lt;ref name="infinit1"/&gt;

[[Henry Poulaille]] was the son of a carpenter and cane worker, who was orphaned at fourteen. In addition to writing novels Poulaille was active in encouraging working class writing in France from the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Burin André and Jean Rousselot, ''Dictionary of Contemporary French Literature''. Paris: Larousse, 1966. See especially [[Michel Ragon]], ''History of Proletarian Literature in France''. Paris: Albin Michel, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of numerous novels, essays on the cinema, literature, and popular traditions. Amongst the novels that he wrote are autobiographical works: ''There were four'' (1925); ''Daily Bread'' (1931); ''The Wretched of the Earth'' (1935); ''Soldier of Pain'' (1937); ''The Survivors: Soldier of Pain 2'' (1938); ''Alone in life to 14 years'' (published posthumously in 1980). In these novels, based on his own life, Poulaiile depicts a working-class family, the Magneux.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Ragon, ''History of proletarian literature in France''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korea==
{{main|Korean_literature#Modern_literature|date=April 2018}}
The proletarian literature movement in Korea was initially driven by the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910 and the state of conditions that followed within the country.&lt;ref name="Floyd, Nikki"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bridging the Colonial Divide: Japanese-Korean Solidarity in the International Proletarian Literature Movement |publisher=Yale University |author= Floyd, Nikki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proletarian literature acted as a movement that attempted to unify Korea against the shift into imperialism and capitalism that was brought forth by colonial Japan and its government that occupied Korea from the point of annexation until the end of World War II in 1945.&lt;ref name="Floyd, Nikki"/&gt; The Korean proletarian literature movement became most prominent in the late 1920s and early 1930s, with the formation of multiple social and cultural groups that created, discussed, and revolved around proletarian arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Important Dates in China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan in Proletarian Art |publisher=Duke University Press | author= Author, Unknown }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Floyd, Nikki"/&gt;

Works of Korean proletarian literature written before 1927 revolved around reconstructing and reforming social issues. One such example would be the short story "Starvation and Slaughter" ("Kia wa Saryuk", 1925) by author Ch'oe Sŏ-hae, which detailed problems like discrimination between the wealthy and the poor classes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yun-Sik|first=Kim|date=Fall 2006|title=KAPF Literature in Modern Korea Literary History|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202393|journal=Duke University Press|volume=14|pages=415–416|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1927, Korean proletarian literature started to revolve around ideas that involved intellectuals rather than focus on the struggles between the rich and poor. Examples of these works include ''The Peasant Cho˘ng To-ryong'' by Yi Ki-yo˘ng, ''A Transitional Period'' by Han So˘r-ya, ''Rat Fire'' by So˘hwa, and ''Hometown'' by Kohyang.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cultural movements, especially those of left-wing politics, were fundamental in driving the proletarian genre and movement in Korea. Yŏmgunsa, meaning Torch of the Masses, was a group and movement formed in 1922 that was led by the writer [[Song Yŏng]], and built on a focus towards literature pertaining to social issues and class politics. PASKYULA was a group that reacted to and discussed commonplace literature and art, with more of a focus on the cultural aspects of the materials. These groups were two largely important circles in the movement of unification that represented the mix of proletarian and bourgeois ideals that initially propelled the genre of proletarian literature in Japan-occupied Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Japanese-Korean Exchange within the Proletarian Visual Arts Movement |publisher=Duke University Press |author= Kida, Emiko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite we |title=Proletarian Sensibilities: The Body Politics of New Tendency Literature (1924–27) |publisher=Duke University Press  |author= Chung, Kimberly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leader of Yŏmgunsa, and a key author in KAPF's circle, Song Yŏng primarily wrote with the intention of forming a solidarity within Korea as well as with Japan through his writing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridging the Colonial Divide: Japanese-Korean Solidarity in the International Proletarian Literature Movement |publisher=Yale University  |author= Floyd, Nikki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two works, "Our Love" in 1929, and "Shift Change" in 1930 highlight Yŏng's ideology of unification within his writing, as well as the idea of moving away from cultural nostalgia and an idyllic past.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In "Our Love", the process of industrialization and its resulting urban cities are portrayed as locales of potential opportunity rather than iniquitous environments, depicting a contrasting opinion to other works produced within KAPF. This is first shown through Yong-hee, a primary character within the story who eventually leaves the Korean countryside and travels to Tokyo, in pursuit of escaping her hometown's oppressive patriarchal culture and finding unity, independence, and equality in urban Japan's workforce.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Set in Japan, "Shift Change" focuses more on the working class movement itself through a group of feuding Korean and Japanese workers. The resolution results in a reconciliation through combined effort, encouraging a combined effort from both the Japanese and Korean proletariat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During the Proletarian Movement, there was an urge from Japanese colonialists to “convert” Koreans away from communism. This conversion system was called ''cho˘nhyang.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of Minjung: Democracy and the Politics of Representation in South Korea|last=Namhee|first=Lee|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=0801445663|location=|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Cho˘nhyang'' sparked numerous works from various authors such as ''The Mire'' by Han So˘r-ya, ''New Year’s Day'' by Yi Kiyo˘ng, ''A Prospect'' by Paek Ch’o˘l, ''Barley'' by Kim Nam-ch’o˘n, and ''Management'' by Kim Nam-ch’o˘n, all published between the years 1939 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yun-Sik|first=Kim|date=Fall 2006|title=KAPF Literature in Modern Korean Literary History|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202393|journal=Duke University Press|volume=14|pages=418–419|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
The proletarian literature movement in Japan emerged from a trend in the latter half of the 1910s of literature about working conditions by authors who had experienced them, later called Taisho workers literature. Representative works from this period include Sukeo Miyajima's ''Miners'' (坑夫) and Karoku Miyachi's ''Tomizō the Vagrant'' (放浪者富蔵), as well as works dealing with military experiences which were also associated with the [[Taishō period#Japan after World War I: Taishō Democracy|Taishō democracy]], the emergence of which allowed for the development of proletarian literature in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} In 1921, [[Ōmi Komaki]] and Hirofumi Kaneko founded the literary magazine ''The Sowers'' (種蒔く人), which aimed to reform both the current literary scene and society. ''The Sowers'' attracted attention for recording tragedies that occurred in the wake of the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].

In 1924, ''Literary Front'' (文芸戦線) magazine was launched by Hatsunosuke Hirabayashi and Suekichi Aono, becoming the main magazine of the Japanese proletarian literature movement. New writing such as [[Yoshiki Hayama]]'s ''The Prostitute'' (淫売婦) and [[Denji Kuroshima]]'s ''A Herd of Pigs'' (豚群) also began to appear in the magazine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 1928, the Japanese Proletarian Arts Federation (全日本無産者芸術連盟, Nippona Artista Proleta Federacio, known as '''NAPF''') was founded, bringing together the Japan Proletarian Artists Union (日本プロレタリア芸術連盟), the Labor-Farmers Artists Union (労農芸術家連盟), and the Vanguard Artists Union (前衛芸術家同盟). NAPF was largely the responsibility of two up-and-coming writers called [[Takiji Kobayashi]] and Sunao Tokunaga, and the organization's newsletter ''Battleflag'' (戦旗) published many influential works such as Kobayashi's ''[[Kanikōsen|The Crab Cannery Ship]]'' (蟹工船) and ''March 15, 1928'' (一九二八年三月十五日) and Tokunaga's ''A Street Without Sun'' (太陽のない街). Another important magazine was ''Reconstruction'' (改造) which published writings from [[Ryunosuke Akutagawa]] and [[Yuriko Miyamoto]], who had just returned from the [[Soviet Union]]. Other more renowned publishers like ''Chūo Kōron'' (Central Review), ''Kaizō'' (Reconstruction), and ''Miyako Shinbun'' also published works by proletarian authors, even those who were members of the Communist party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recasting Red Culture in Proletarian Japan: Childhood, Korea, and the Historical Avant-Garde|last=Perry|first=Samuel|publisher=University of Hawaii|year=2014|isbn=9780824838935|location=Honolulu|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Korehito Kurehara traveled secretly to the Soviet Union in 1930 for the [[Profintern]] conference, and upon his return in 1931, he started agitating for the democratization of literary organizations. This sparked the drive to organize literary circles in factories and rural areas, creating a new source of readers and writers there.

In 1931, the NAPF became the Union of Japanese Proletarian Cultural Organizations (日本プロレタリア文化連盟, Federacio de Proletaj Kultur Organizoj Japanaj, also known as '''KOPF'''), incorporating other cultural organizations, such as musicians and filmmakers. KOPF produced various magazines including ''Working Woman'' (働く婦人)

The Japanese government cracked down harshly on proletarian authors, as the Japanese Communist Party had been outlawed since its founding in 1922. Though not all authors were associated with the party, the KOPF was, leading to mass arrests such as the [[March 15 incident]]. Some authors, such as Takiji Kobayashi were tortured to death by police, while others were forced to [[Tenkō|renounce their socialist beliefs]].

''[[Kanikōsen]]'' (1929) is a short novel by [[Takiji Kobayashi]] (translated into English as ''The Cannery Boat'' (1933), ''The Factory Ship'' (1973) and ''The Crab Cannery Ship'' (2013)), which depicts the lives of Japanese crab fishermen. Told from a [[left-wing]] point of view, it is concerned with the hardships that the crew face and how they are exploited by the owners. The book has been made into a film and as [[manga]].

==Romania==
[[Panait Istrati]] (1884–1935), was a [[Romania]]n working class writer, the son of the laundress  and of a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[smuggler]].  He studied in primary school for six years in [[Vădeni, Brăila|Baldovinești]], after being held back twice. He then earned his living as an apprentice to a tavern-keeper, then as a pastry cook and peddler. In the meantime, he was a prolific reader.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Dadoun, ''Panait Istrati'', L'Arc, Aix-en-Provence, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Istrati's first attempts at writing date from around 1907 when he started sending pieces to the [[Socialism|socialist]] periodicals in Romania, debuting with the article, ''Hotel Regina'' in ''[[România Muncitoare]]''. Here, he later published his first short stories, ''Mântuitorul'' ("The Redeemer"), ''Calul lui Bălan'' ("Bălan's Horse"), ''Familia noastră'' ("Our Family"), ''1 Mai'' ("[[May Day]]"). He also contributed pieces to other [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] newspapers such as ''Dimineața'', ''[[Adevărul]]'', and ''Viața Socială''. In 1910, he was involved in organizing a strike in Brăila. He went to [[Bucharest]], [[Istanbul]], [[Cairo]], [[Naples]], [[Paris]] (1913–1914), and [[Switzerland]], where he settled for a while, trying to cure his [[tuberculosis]]). Istrati's travels were marked by two successive unhappy marriages, a brief return to Romania in 1915 when he tried to earn his living as a pig farmer, and long periods of vagabondage.&lt;ref&gt;Édouard Raydon, ''Panaït Istrati, vagabond de génie'', Les Éditions Municipales, Paris, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1923 in literature|1923]] Istrati's story ''Kyra Kyralina'' (or ''Chira Chiralina'') was published with a preface by the famous French novelist [[Romaine Rolland]]. It became the first in his ''Adrien Zograffi'' [[Literature cycle|literary cycle]]. Rolland was fascinated with Istrati's adventurous life, urging him to write more and publishing parts of his work in ''Clarté'', the journal that Rolland and [[Henri Barbusse]] ran.&lt;ref name="Roger Dadoun"&gt;Roger Dadoun.&lt;/ref&gt; The next major work by Istrati was the [[novel]] ''Codine''.&lt;ref name="Roger Dadoun"/&gt;

The next recorder mentioned was [[Joah]], in the reign of [[Hezekiah]] (2 Kings 18:18,37; [[Isaiah]] 36:3,22). In the reign of [[Josiah]] another person named Joah filled this office (2 Chronicles 34:8).

The "recorder" was the chancellor or [[vizier]] of the kingdom. He brought all weighty matters under the notice of the king, "such as complaints, petitions, and wishes of subjects or foreigners. He also drew up papers for the king's guidance, and prepared drafts of the royal will for the scribes. All treaties came under his oversight; and he had the care of the national archives or records, to which, as royal [[historiographer]], like the same state officer in [[Assyria]] and Egypt, he added the current annals of the kingdom."

{{Politics}}

In [[politics]], '''regionalism''' is a [[List of political ideologies|political ideology]] focusing on the "development of a political or social system based on one or more" [[region#Political regions|regions]]&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regionalism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 422257|title = A Rational Choice Approach to Political Regionalism|journal = Comparative Politics|volume = 23|issue = 4|pages = 401–421|last1 = Meadwell|first1 = Hudson|year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or the national, normative or economic interests of a specific region, group of regions or another subnational entity,&lt;ref&gt;https://study.com/academy/lesson/regionalism-in-politics-definition-characteristics-types.html&lt;/ref&gt; gaining strength from or aiming to strengthen the "consciousness of and loyalty to a distinct region with a homogeneous population",&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"/&gt; similarly to [[nationalism]]. More specifically, "regionalism refers to three distinct elements: movements demanding territorial autonomy within unitary states; the organization of the central state on a regional basis for the delivery of its policies including regional development policies; political decentralization and regional autonomy".&lt;ref&gt;https://pesd.princeton.edu/?q=node/264&lt;/ref&gt;

Regions may be delineated by [[administrative division]]s, [[cultural area|culture]], [[Regional language|language]] and [[Religion and geography#Community and identity|religion]], among others. 

Regionalists aim at increasing the [[Power (social and political)|political power]] and influence available to all or some residents of a region. Their demands occur in "strong" forms, such as [[sovereignty]], [[separatism]], [[secession]] and [[independence]], as well as more moderate campaigns for greater [[autonomous administrative division|autonomy]] (such as [[states' rights]], [[decentralization]] or [[devolution]]). Strictly, regionalists favour [[confederation]]s over [[unitary state|unitary]] [[nation state]]s with strong [[central government]]s. They may, however, embrace intermediate forms of [[federalism]].

Proponents of regionalism usually claim that strengthening the governing bodies and political powers within a region, at the expense of a central government, will benefit local populations by improving regional or local economies, in terms of better [[balanced budget|fiscal responsibility]], [[regional development]], allocation of resources, implementation of local policies and plans, [[competition (companies)|competitiveness]] among regions and, ultimately, the whole country, consistently with the principle of [[subsidiarity]].

==Regionalism, autonomism, nationalism==
Regionalism, [[autonomism (political doctrine)|autonomism]], [[secession]]ism and [[nationalism]] are interrelated concepts, yet they often have different and sometimes opposite meanings. For instance, in [[Spain]] "regionalism" is regarded as strongly associated with "nationalism" and, often, "secessionism", whereas in [[Italy]], it is generally seen as a synonym of "[[federalism]]" and the opposite of "nationalism". In some cases movements or parties campaigning for independence may push for federalism or autonomy within the pre-existing [[nation state]].

In [[developed country|developed]], [[Western world|western]], [[liberal democracy|liberal-democratic]] countries, secessionist parties include the ''[[Parti Québécois]]'' in [[Quebec]] ([[Canada]]), the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] and ''[[EH Bildu|Euskal Herria Bildu]]'' in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] (Spain and [[France]]), the [[New Flemish Alliance]] and [[Vlaams Belang]] in [[Flanders]] ([[Belgium]]), the [[Catalan European Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] in ''[[Països Catalans]]'' (Spain and France), the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] and the [[Galician Left Alternative]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (Spain), the [[Scottish National Party]] and the [[Scottish Green Party]] in [[Scotland]], the ''[[Plaid Cymru]]'' in [[Wales]] and, to some extent, ''[[Sinn Féin]]'' in [[Northern Ireland]] ([[United Kingdom]]).

In [[developing country|developing countries]] they include the [[Polisario Front]] in [[Western Sahara]] ([[Morocco]]), the [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad]] in [[Azawad]] ([[Mali]]), the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]] in the [[Cabinda Province]] ([[Angola]]), and all [[wars of national liberation|national liberation movements]].

Federalist/autonomist regional parties include the ''[[Coalition Avenir Québec]]'' in Quebec (Canada), the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico]] and the [[Popular Democratic Party (Puerto Rico)|Popular Democratic Party]] in [[Puerto Rico]] (a [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] of the [[United States]]), ''[[Lega Nord]]'' in [[Northern Italy]] (the party has, at times, advocated [[Padania]]'s independence and its "national section" in [[Veneto]], ''[[Liga Veneta]]'', is a proponent of Venetian independence), the [[Party of the Corsican Nation]] in [[Corsica]] (France), the [[Martinican Progressive Party]] in [[Martinique]] and the [[Communist Party of Réunion]] in [[Réunion]] (both [[Overseas departments and territories of France|French overseas territories]]), and the [[New Macau Association]] in [[Macau]] ([[China]]).

In some countries, the development of regionalist politics may be a prelude to further demands for greater autonomy or even full separation, especially when ethnic, cultural and economic disparities are present. This was demonstrated, among other examples, in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in the early 1990s.

==Regional vs. regionalist political parties==
[[Political party|Political parties]] that are ''regional'' are not necessarily ''regionalist'' parties. A "regional party" is any political party with its [[Base (politics)|base]] in a single region, whatever its objectives and platform may be. Whereas "regionalist" parties are a subset of regional parties that specifically campaign for greater autonomy or independence in their region.

Because regional parties – including regionalist parties – often cannot receive enough votes or legislative seats to be politically powerful, they may join [[political coalition]]s or seek to be part of a [[coalition government]]. Notable examples include the Sinn Féin's participation in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] since 1999, the New Flemish Alliance's participation in the [[Federal Government of Belgium]] since 2014, and ''Lega Nord'''s participation in the [[Council of Ministers (Italy)|Italian government]] in 1994, 2001–2006 and 2008–2011.

Examples of regional parties that do not generally campaign for greater autonomy or federalism include most [[List of political parties in Canada#Provincial and territorial parties|provincial parties in Canada]], most [[list of regional and minority parties in Europe|regional and minority parties in Europe]], notably including the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] in [[Bavaria]] ([[Germany]]), most [[political parties in Belgium|parties in Belgium]], most [[list of political parties in Northern Ireland|parties in Northern Ireland]], the [[Istrian Democratic Assembly]] in [[Istria County|Istria]] and the [[Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar]] in [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County|Primorje-Gorski Kotar]] (both [[Counties of Croatia|counties]] of [[Croatia]]), and most [[list of political parties in India|political parties]] in [[India]].

Regional parties with an autonomist/federalist or secessionist agenda include the aforementioned ''Bloc Québécois'', ''Lega Nord'', the ''Vlaams Belang'', the New Flemish Alliance, the Catalan European Democratic Party, the Republican Left of Catalonia, the Scottish National Party, the ''Plaid Cymru'', and ''Sinn Féin''.

The '''Saramaka''' or '''Saramacca''' are one of six [[Maroon (people)|Maroon peoples]] (formerly called "Bush Negroes") in the Republic of [[Suriname]] and one of the Maroon peoples in [[French Guiana]]. (Note that beginning in mid-2010, the people formerly known as “Saramaka” began identifying themselves, in their official documents in English, as "Saamaka," to conform to their own pronunciation.) In 2007, the Saramaka won a ruling by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights|Inter-American Court for Human Rights]] supporting their land rights in Suriname for lands they have historically occupied, over national government claims. It was a landmark decision for indigenous peoples in the world. They have received compensation for damages and control this fund for their own development goals. 

The word "Maroon" comes from the Spanish ''cimarrón'', which was derived from an [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan root]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arrom |first=José |title=Cimarrón: Apuntes sobre sus primeras documentaciones y su probable origen |journal=Revista Española de Antropología Americana |volume=13 |pages=13-30 |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990 especially, some of the Saramaka have migrated to French Guiana due to extended civil war in Suriname. By the early 16th century, the term "maroon" (''cimarron'') was used throughout the Americas to designate slaves who had escaped from [[slavery]] and set up independent communities beyond colonists' control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Price |editor-first1=Richard |title=Maroon Societies: Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas |date=1996 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore, MD |isbn=978-0801854965 |edition=3rd |pages=xi-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with five other Maroon tribes in Suriname and French Guiana, the Saramaka form the largest group in the world of Maroon peoples of African descent. 

== Setting and language ==
Suriname, formerly called Dutch Guiana, has been independent from the Netherlands since 1975. The 90,000 Saramaka (some of whom live in neighboring [[French Guiana]]) are one minority within this multi-ethnic nation, which includes approximately 27 per cent [[Indian people|Hindustanis]] (East Indian descendants of contract laborers brought in after the abolition of slavery); 14.5 per cent [[Afro-Surinamese|Creoles]] (descendants of Africans brought as slaves); 14 per cent [[Javanese people|Javanese]] (descendants of contract workers brought during the early 20th century from [[Indonesia]]); 23.5 per cent Maroons (descendants of Africans brought as slaves); 3 per cent Chinese, [[Levant]]ines, and Europeans; and 3.7 per cent [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]]. 

The Saramaka, together with the other Maroons in Suriname and French Guiana: the [[Ndyuka people|Ndyuka]] (90,000), and the [[Matawai (people)|Matawai]], [[Paramaka]], [[Aluku]], and [[Kwinti]] (who together number some 25,000), constitute by far the world's largest surviving population of Maroons of African descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Richard |title=The Maroon Population Explosion: Suriname and Guyane |journal=New West Indian Guide |volume=87 |issue=3/4 |year=2013 |pages=323-327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since their escape from [[slavery]] in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Saramaka have lived chiefly along the upper [[Suriname River]] and its tributaries, the Gaánlío and the Pikílío. Since the 1960s, they also live along the lower Suriname River in villages constructed by the [[Colonialism|colonial government]] and [[Alcoa]], a major aluminum company. They were relocated to allow flooding of approximately half their tribal territory for a [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric project]] built to supply electricity for an [[aluminum]] [[Smelting|smelter]]. Today, about one-third of the Saramaka live in French Guiana, most having migrated there since 1990 after warfare in Suriname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Price |first1=Richard |last2=Price |first2=Sally |title=Les Marrons |date=2003 |publisher=Vents d'Ailleurs |location=Chateauneuf-le-Rouge |isbn=978-2911412226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saramaka and the Matawai (in central Suriname) speak variants of a [[creole language]] called [[Saramaccan language|Saramaccan]]. The Ndyuka, Paramaka, and Aluku, (in eastern Suriname), as well as the several hundred Kwinti, speak variants of another creole language, [[Ndyuka language|Ndyuka]]. Both languages are historically related to [[Sranan Tongo]], the creole language of coastal Suriname. About 50 percent of the Saramaccan [[lexicon]] derives from various West and Central African languages, 20 percent from English (the language of the original colonists in Suriname), 20 percent from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (the language of the overseers and slave masters on many Suriname [[plantation]]s), and the remaining 10 percent from Amerindian languages and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (the latter were later colonists).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Price, ''Travels with Tooy: History, Memory, and the African American Imagination'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008, p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; Although lexically different, the grammar resembles that of the other Atlantic creoles and derives from West African models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor-last=Migge |editor-first=Bettina |title=Substrate Influence in the Creoles of Suriname |url=http://linguistics.osu.edu/sites/linguistics.osu.edu/files/dissertations/Migge1998.pdf |journal=Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages |volume=22 |issue=1 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ancestors of the Saramaka were among those Africans sold as plantation [[slaves]] to Europeans in Suriname in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Slay Hydra"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Coming from a variety of West and Central African peoples speaking many different languages, they escaped into the dense [[rainforest]] – individually, in small groups, and sometimes in great collective rebellions. For nearly 100 years, they fought from the rainforest for their independence. They were so feared that late 18th century maps showed the defensive fortifications in the European colony intended to protect against their raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/524/ |title=Extract of the Dutch Map Representing the Colony of Surinam |year=1777 |website=Digital World Library |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1762, a full century before the general [[emancipation]] of slaves in Suriname, the Maroons won their freedom and signed a treaty with the Dutch Crown to acknowledge their territorial rights and trading privileges. The Saramaka have a keen interest in the history of their formative years; they preserve their very rich [[oral tradition]]. Innovative scholarly research since the late 20th century has brought together oral and archival accounts in new histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Price |first1=Richard |title=First-time: The Historical Vision of an Afro-American People |date=1983 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=9780801829857}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slay Hydra"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Price |first1=Richard |title=To Slay the Hydra: Dutch Colonial Perspectives on the Saramaka Wars |date=1983 |publisher=Karoma |location=Ann Arbor, MI |isbn=9780897200660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Richard|title=Alabi's World|date=1995|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801838620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other Suriname Maroons, the Saramaka lived almost as a state-within-a-state until the mid-20th century, when the pace of outside encroachments increased. 

During the late 1980s, a civil war between Maroons and the military government of Suriname caused considerable hardship to the Saramaka and other Maroons. By mid-1989 approximately 3,000 Saramaka and 8,000 Ndyuka were living as temporary refugees in French Guiana. Access to the outside world was severely restricted for many Saramaka in their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Polimé |first1=Thomas |last2=van Velzen |first2=H.U.E. Thoden |title=Vluchtelingen, opstandelingen en andere: Bosnegers van Oost-Suriname, 1986-1988 |date=1988 |publisher=Instituut voor Culturele Antropologie |location=Utrecht |isbn=9789070955229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the war in the mid-1990s initiated a period in which the national government largely neglected the needs of Saramaka and other Maroons while granting large timber and mining concessions to foreign multinationals (Chinese, Indonesian, Malaysian, and others) in traditional Saramaka territory. They did not consult the Saramaka authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kambel |first1=Ellen-Rose |last2=MacKay |first2=Fergus |title=The Rights of Indigenous Peoples and Maroons of Suriname |date=1999 |publisher=International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs |location=Copenhagen |isbn=978-8790730178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, during this period there were numerous social changes, both on the coast of Suriname and in Saramaka territory. [[Peace Corps|United States Peace Corps]] volunteers lived and worked in Saramaka villages, and [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] gold-miners arrived on the Suriname river. Such economic activities as prostitution, casino gambling, and drug smuggling became major industries in coastal Suriname and accompanied the miners to the interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Westoll |first1=Andrew |title=The Riverbones: Stumbling After Eden in the Jungles of Suriname |date=2008 |publisher=Emblem |location=Toronto, Canada |isbn=978-0771088759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, the Association of Saramaka Authorities filed a complaint before the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|Inter-American Commission of Human Rights]] to protect their [[land rights]]. In November 2007, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights|Inter-American Court for Human Rights]] ruled in favor of the Saramaka people against the government of Suriname.&lt;ref name="Case Judgment"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/casos/articulos/seriec_172_ing.pdf |title=Case of the Saramaka People v. Suriname, Judgment of November 28, 2007 |publisher=Inter-American Court of Human Rights (La Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos) |accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this landmark decision, which establishes a precedent for all Maroon and [[indigenous peoples]] in the Americas, the Saramaka were granted collective rights to the lands on which their ancestors had lived since the early 18th century, including rights to decide about the exploitation of [[natural resource]]s such as timber and [[gold]] within that territory. In addition, they were granted compensation from the government for damages caused by previous timber grants made to Chinese companies. This was paid into a special [[Community development|development]] fund, which is now managed by the Saramaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Price |first1=Richard |title=Rainforest Warriors Human Rights on Trial |year=2012 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Pennsylvania |isbn=9780812221374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Case Judgment"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brunner |first1=Lisl |title=The Rise of Peoples' Rights in the Americas: The Saramaka People Decision of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights |journal=Chinese Journal of International Law |date=1 October 2008 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=699–711 |doi=10.1093/chinesejil/jmn031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsistence, economy, and the arts ==
[[File:Maroon Art - Museum - Nieuw Amsterdam (23624931402).jpg|alt=Example of art by the Saramaka folk|thumb|281x281px|Example of art by the Saramaka folk]]
Traditional villages, which average 100 to 200 residents, consist of a core of [[Matrilineality|matrilineal kin]] plus some wives and children of lineage men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Price |first1=Richard |title=Saramaka Social Structure: Analysis of a Maroon Society in Surinam |date=1975 |publisher=Institute of Caribbean Studies, University of Puerto Rico |location=Río Piedras |isbn=9788439938507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Always located near a river, for water, transportation and fishing, they are constructed of an irregular arrangement of small houses, open-sided structures, domesticated trees, occasional chicken houses, various [[shrine]]s, and scattered patches of bush. (In contrast, the so-called transmigration villages, built to house the 6,000 Saramaka displaced by the hydroelectric project, range up to 2,000 people. They are laid out in a European-style [[Grid plan|grid pattern]], used throughout larger South American cities. In many cases they have been located far from the riverside, making life difficult for the occupants.) [[Horticulture|Horticultural camps]], which include permanent houses and shrines, are located several hours by [[canoe]] from each village. They are exploited by small groups of women related through matrilineal ties. 

Due to their matrilineal ties, many women have a house in their own birth village, another in their horticultural camp, and a third in their husband's village. Men divide their time among several different houses, built at various times for themselves and for their wives. Traditional Saramaka houses are compact, wide enough to tie a hammock and not much longer from front to back; with walls of planks and woven [[palm branch (symbol)|palm fronds]], and traditionally roofs of [[thatch]] or, increasingly, of [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated metal]]. They do not have windows but often have elaborately carved [[facade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Price |first1=Sally |last2=Price |first2=Richard |title=Maroon Arts: Cultural Vitality in the African Diaspora |date=1999 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=9780807085509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Suriname civil war, the Saramaka have built an increasing number of houses in coastal, Western style. They use [[concrete]] as well as wood, and feature  windows and more expansive [[floor plan]]s.

For more than two centuries, the economy has been based on full exploitation of the forest environment and on periodic work trips by men to the coast to bring back Western goods. For subsistence, the Saramaka depend on shifting ([[Slash and burn|swidden]]) horticulture done mostly by women, with hunting and fishing done by men, supplemented by the women gathering wild forest products, such as palm nuts. They imported a few key items,  such as [[salt]]. [[Rice]] is the most cultivated crop, in dry (hillside) technique. Other crops include [[cassava]], [[taro]], [[okra]], [[maize]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, [[banana]]s, [[sugarcane]], and [[peanut]]s. Domesticated trees, such as [[coconut]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[breadfruit]], [[papaya]], and [[calabash]] are mainly cultivated in the villages. There are no markets.

Until the late 20th century, the Saramaka produced most of their material culture, much of it embellished with decorative detail. Women sewed [[patchwork]] and embroidered clothing, and carved [[calabash]] bowls. Some men also produced baskets, and some women made pottery. Men built the houses and canoes. In addition, they carved a wide range of wooden objects for domestic use, such as stools, paddles, [[Winnowing|winnowing trays]], cooking utensils, and combs. Today, an increasing number of items, including clothing, are imported from the coast. 

Body [[Scarification|cicatrization]], practiced by virtually all Saramaka women as late as the 1970s and 1980s, had become relatively uncommon by the start of the 21st century. Numerous genres of singing, dance, drumming, and tale telling continue to be a vibrant part of Saramaka culture.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of popular songs, work songs, finger piano pieces, children's riddles, drum language on the ''apínti'' talking drum, and more, see {{cite AV media |author1-last=Price |author1-first=Richard |author2-last=Price |author2-first=Sally |year=1977 |title=Music from Saramaka: A Dynamic Afro American Tradition |medium=CD |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian/Folkways Recordings |oclc=50625762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the men have cleared and burned the fields, horticulture is mainly women's work. Women cultivate and process a variety of crops, choosing which to develop to continue preferred qualities. They process the food for meals and storage of foods such as peanuts. They use parts of plants to make some needed goods.

The men conduct hunting of game with [[shotgun]]s; they also do most of the fishing as well. Men have long devoted a large portion of their adult years to earning money in work in coastal Suriname or French Guiana. This allows them to buy the Western goods considered essential to life in their home villages, such as shotguns and [[Gunpowder|powder]], tools, pots, cloth, hammocks, soap, [[kerosene]], and [[rum]]. During the second half of the 20th century, small stores were established in many villages, making more goods available. [[Outboard motor]]s, [[transistor radio]]s, and [[tape recorder]]s became common consumer items. Today, [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] are ubiquitous; both men and women have greatly increased communication with [[Paramaribo]]. New economic opportunities in the gold industry – mining for men, prostitution for women – are being exploited.

== Social organization ==
Saramaka society is firmly based on a matrilineal [[kinship system]]. A [[clan]] (''lo'') – often several thousand individuals – consists of the matrilineal descendants of an original [[Band society|band]] of escaped slaves. Children are considered born into this clan. It is subdivided into [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineages]] (''bee'') – usually 50 to 150 people – descended from a more recent ancestress. Several lineages from a single clan constitute the core of every village.

The matrilineal clans (''lo'') own land, based on claims staked out in the early 18th century as the original Maroons fled southward to [[Liberty|freedom]]. Hunting and gathering rights belong to clan members collectively. Within the clan, temporary rights to land use for farming are negotiated by village headmen. The establishment of transmigration villages in the 1960s led to land shortages in certain regions. The success of the Saramakas in their [[lawsuit]] against the government of Suriname will now permit them to manage their lands with less outside interference.

Complex marriage prohibitions (including ''bee'' [[exogamy]]) and preferences are negotiated through [[divination]]. Demographic imbalance, owing to labor migration, permits widespread [[polygyny]]. Although co-wives hold equal status, relations between them are expected to be adversarial. The Saramaka treat marriage as an ongoing [[courtship]], with frequent exchanges of gifts such as men's [[woodcarving]] and women's decorative sewing. Although many women live primarily in their husband's village, men never spend more than a few days at a time in the matrilineal (home) village of a wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Price |first=Sally |title=Co-wives and Calabashes |date=1984 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor |isbn=9780472100453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each house belongs to an individual man or woman, but most [[social interaction]] occurs outdoors. The men in each cluster of several houses, whether ''bee'' members or temporary visitors, eat meals together. The women of these same clusters, whether ''bee'' members or resident wives of ''bee'' men, spend a great deal of time in each other's company, often farming together as well.

Matrilineal principles, mediated by divination, determine the inheritance of material and spiritual possessions as well as [[Politician|political offices]]. Before death, however, men often pass on specialized [[ritual]] knowledge (and occasionally a shotgun) to a son.

Each child, after spending its first several years with its mother, is raised by an individual man or woman (not a couple) designated by the ''bee'', girls typically are raised by women, and boys by men. Although children spend most of their time with matrilineal kin, father-child relations are warm and strong. [[Gender identity]] is established early, with children taking on responsibility for gender-typed adult tasks as soon as they are physically able. Girls often marry by age 15, whereas boys are more often in their twenties when they take their first wife. 

A woman is required to go into seclusion during her menstrual cycle. The cycle is considered a time of transgression and destructive of village order. Women are not allowed to perform many of the village's functions and face other restrictions during their menstrual cycle. The Saramaka expression "to be in menstrual seclusion" is the same as "to be in mourning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Price |first=Sally |title=Co-Wives and Calabashes |year=1996 |publisher=The University Michigan Press |location=United States |pages=xi-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political organization and social control ==
The Saramaka people, like the other Maroon groups, are politically and formally run by men. The 2007 ruling of the Inter-American Court for Human Rights helps define the spheres of influence in which the national government and Saramaka authorities hold sway.

Saramaka [[society]] is [[egalitarian]], with [[kinship]] forming the backbone of [[social organization]]. No social or occupational [[Social class|classes]] are distinguished. Elders are accorded special respect and ancestors are consulted, through [[divination]], on a daily basis.

[[Missionary|Protestant missionary schools]] have existed in some villages since the 18th century. State [[elementary school]]s came to most villages only in the 1960s. Schools ceased to function completely during the Suriname civil war of the late 1980s and have been rebuilt only partially since.

Since the 18th-century treaty, the Saramaka have had a government-approved [[paramount chief]] (''gaamá''), as well as a series of headmen (''kabiteni'') and assistant headmen (''basiá''). Traditionally, the role of these officials in political and social control was exercised in a context replete with [[oracle]]s, [[spirit possession]], and other forms of divination. As the national government is intervening more frequently in Saramaka affairs (and paying political officials nominal salaries), the sacred base of these officials’ power is gradually being eroded. These political offices are historically controlled and the property of [[clans]] (''lo''). Political activity is strongly dominated by men.

Council meetings (''kuútu'') and divination sessions provide complementary arenas for the resolution of social problems. Palavers may involve the men of a lineage, a village, or all Saramaka. They treat problems ranging from conflicts concerning marriage or [[fosterage]] to land disputes, political succession, or major crimes. These same problems, in addition to illness and other kinds of misfortune, are routinely interpreted through various kinds of divination as well. In all cases, consensus is found through negotiation, often with a strong role being played by [[Polytheism|gods]] and ancestors. In a type of reconciliation justice, guilty parties are usually required to pay for their misdeeds with material offerings to the lineage of the offended person. In the 18th century people found guilty of [[witchcraft]] were sometimes burned at the stake. Today, men caught [[in flagrante delicto]] with the wife of another man are either beaten by the woman's kinsmen or made to pay them a fine.

Aside from adultery disputes, which sometimes mobilize a full canoe-load of men seeking revenge in a public fistfight, intra-Saramaka conflict rarely surpasses the level of personal relations. The civil war that began in 1986, pitting Maroons against the national army of Suriname, brought major changes to the villages of the interior. Members of the "Jungle Commando" rebel army, almost all [[Ndyuka people|Ndyuka]] and Saramaka, learned to use [[Automatic firearm|automatic weapons]]. They became accustomed to a [[Perpetual war|state of war]] and plunder. Their reintegration into Saramaka (and Ndyuka) society has been difficult, though their migration to the coast and French Guiana has provided a [[safety valve]], if not for the receiving areas.

== Belief system ==
Every aspect of Saramaka [[Phenomenological life|life]] is based in various [[religious]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Price, ''Travels with Tooy: History, Memory, and the African American Imagination'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Such decisions as where to clear a garden or build a house, whether to undertake a trip, or how to deal with theft or adultery are made in consultation with village deities, ancestors, forest [[spirit]]s, and [[Snake worship|snake gods]]. The means of communication with these powers vary from spirit possession and the consultation of oracle-bundles, to the interpretation of dreams. Gods and spirits, which are a constant presence in daily life, are also honored through frequent [[prayer]]s, [[libation]]s, feasts, and dances. 

The [[ritual]]s surrounding birth, death, and other life passages are extensive, as are those relating to more mundane activities, from hunting a [[tapir]] to planting a rice field. Today about 25 per cent of Saramaka are nominal Christians – mainly [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] (some since the mid-18th century), but others [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. Increasingly some are converted to [[Evangelicalism]] of one or another kind.

The Saramaka world is populated by a wide range of [[supernatural]] beings, from localized forest spirits and gods that reside in the bodies of snakes, [[vulture]]s, [[jaguar]]s, and other animals, to ancestors, river gods, and warrior spirits. Within these categories, each supernatural being is named, individualized, and given specific relationships to living people. Intimately involved in the ongoing events of daily life, these beings communicate to humans mainly through divination and spirit possession. ''Kúnus'' are the avenging spirits of people or gods who were wronged during their lifetime and who pledge themselves to eternally tormenting the matrilineal descendants and close matrilineal kinsmen of their offender. Much of Saramaka ritual life is devoted to their appeasement. The Saramaka believe that all [[evil]] originates in human action; not only does each misfortune, illness, or death stem from a specific past misdeed, but every offense, whether against people or gods, has eventual consequences. The ignoble acts of the dead intrude daily on the lives of the living; any illness or misfortune calls for divination, which quickly reveals the specific past act that caused it. Through the performance of [[rite]]s, the ancestors speak, the gods dance, and the world is again made right.

Individual specialists who supervise rites oversee the major village- and clan-owned [[shrine]]s that serve large numbers of clients, as well as the various categories of possession gods, and various kinds of minor divination. These specialists generally pass on their knowledge to selected individuals before death. A large proportion of Saramaka have some kind of specialized ritual expertise, which they occasionally exercise. They are paid in cloth, [[rum]], or, increasingly, cash.

Saramaka [[Ceremony|ceremonial life]] is not determined by the calendar, but rather regulated by the occurrence of particular misfortunes, interpreted through divination. The most important ceremonies include those surrounding funerals and the appeasement of ancestors, public curing rites, rituals in honor of ''kúnus'' (in particular snake gods and forest spirits), and the installation of political officials.

Every case of illness is believed to have a specific cause that can be determined only through divination. The causes revealed vary from a lineage ''kúnu'' to [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], from a broken [[taboo]] to an ancestor's displeasure. Once the cause is known, rites are carried out to appease the offended god or ancestor (or otherwise right the social imbalance). Since the 1960s, Western mission clinics and hospitals have been used by most Saramaka as a supplement to their own healing practices. During the Suriname Civil War of the 1980s and 1990s, most of these facilities were destroyed. They have only been very partially restored since.

The dead play an active role in the lives of the living. Ancestor shrines – several to a village – are the site of frequent prayers and libations, as the dead are consulted about ongoing village problems. A death occasions a series of complex rituals that lasts about a year, culminating in the final passage of the deceased to the status of ancestor. The initial rites, which are carried out over a period of one week to three months, depending on the importance of the deceased, end with the burial of the corpse in an elaborately constructed [[coffin]] filled with personal belongings. These rites include divination with the coffin (to consult the spirit of the deceased) by carrying it on the heads of two men, feasts for the ancestors, all-night drum/song/dance performances, and the telling of [[Folklore|folktale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Price |first1=Richard |last2=Bilby |first2=Sally Price |title=Two Evenings in Saramaka |date=1991 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=9780226680613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some months later, a "second funeral" is conducted to mark the end of the [[Mourning|mourning period]] and to chase the [[ghost]] of the deceased from the village forever. These rites involve the largest public gatherings in Saramaka and also include all-night drum/song/dance performances. At their conclusion, the deceased has passed out of the realm of the living into that of the ancestors.

== Isolation ==
The Saramaka people beyond Gaan Lio lived in relative isolation and as an [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted people group]] from the time of their ancestor's escape from slavery in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE: SARAMAKA (SARAMACCAN) PEOPLE: THE FEARLESS SURINAME LARGEST MAROON TRIBE|url = http://kwekudee-tripdownmemorylane.blogspot.com/2013/06/saramaka-saramaccan-people-fearless.html|website = TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE|date = 2013-06-25|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter part of 1993, a local, independent missionary by the name of Steve Groseclose and a small group of Saramaka men from other less remote villages ventured beyond the main barrier point called Tapa Wata Sula, translated as Shut Off Rapids. This initial excursion led to subsequent trips and began the gradual influx of increasing outside influence throughout the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE: SARAMAKA (SARAMACCAN) PEOPLE: THE FEARLESS SURINAME LARGEST MAROON TRIBE|url = http://kwekudee-tripdownmemorylane.blogspot.com/2013/06/saramaka-saramaccan-people-fearless.html|website = TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE|date = 2013-06-25|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local Saramaka man named Pompeia had left one of the uncontacted villages to visit the capital city of [[Paramaribo]] earlier that year. His knowledge of the villages beyond Tapa Wata Sula made him an invaluable guide on the first trips into the area.

== Ethnographic studies ==
[[Ethnography]] among the Saramaka was first conducted by Americans [[Melville J. Herskovits|Melville and Frances Herskovits]] (during two summers in 1928 and 1929).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Melville J Herskovits |last2=Frances S.

This late-20th century fieldwork complements the modern fieldwork carried out among other groups of Suriname Maroons, such as the [[Ndyuka people|Ndyuka]] ethnography of Dutch scholars [[Bonno]] and Ineke Thoden van Velzen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Velzen |first1=H.U.E.

[[Edward C. Green]], an American medical anthropologist, conducted fieldwork among the Matawais between 1970–73, with intermittent visits since. His doctoral dissertation focused on changes underway then in the matrilineal kinship and indigenous spiritual belief systems. He has become known for his work on processes related to AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, especially in African nations, and making use of indigenous healers.

'''Tarapatie "Tara" Oedayraj Singh Varma''' (born in [[Corriverton|Springlands]] ([[British Guiana]]), August 29, 1948) is a former Dutch politician and former member of the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] for the [[GroenLinks|GreenLeft party]] who gained notoriety after falsely claiming to suffer from an incurable cancer.

== Life before politics ==
Although she was born in British Guiana, she attended vocational education in [[Surinam]], which was a [[Dutch empire|colony of the Netherlands]] at the time, studying [[teaching]] and [[law]], without graduating. She then moved to [[Amsterdam]], in the continental part of the [[Netherlands]]. In Amsterdam she became active for the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands]]. Between 1982 and 1994 she was member of the Amsterdam [[gemeenteraad|municipal council]] for the CPN, between 1986 and 1990 for the Left Accord, a common list of the [[Pacifist Socialist Party]] and the [[Political Party of Radicals]], and between 1990 and 1994 for [[GreenLeft]], which was formed by a merger of CPN, PSP, PPR, and the small [[Evangelical People's Party (Netherlands)|Evangelical People's Party]].

Singh Varma was very active in civil society. She was a member various boards of associations and foundations for migrants, women and other social groups. She founded and led an Amsterdam information point. She had a column in the women's weekly ''Furore'', and was a member of the radio panel of the [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA]] radio show Punch. She also was treasurer of the Grenada Committee.

== Political life ==
After the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election]], Singh Varma became a member of the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]]. She succeeded [[Ina Brouwer]], who had stepped down after the poor election results. She was the first female member of the House of Representatives who was not born in the Netherlands. When she entered parliament questions were raised about her integrity. There were questions surrounding [[fundraising]] efforts for the Grenada Foundation in which Singh Varma was involved. A committee led by former minister [[Dieuwke de Graaff-Nauta]] came to the conclusion that Singh Varma had not embezzled money, but that her actions as [[treasurer]] had been neglectful. In parliament Singh Varma spoke on home affairs, health, and welfare. She paid particular attention to the position of migrant women. While in parliament she took many positions outside of parliament in boards of foundations and associations for migrants, women and other social groups. She chaired the Surinam Women's Council and was member of the board of the Volunteer Centre in Amsterdam, the migrant women centre Zami, and the [[prostitute]]s' [[trade union]] the Red Thread. In 1996 she claimed to be intimidated and attacked by [[far right]] groups. No proof of this was ever found.

In 1997 she was put on the ninth place on the GreenLeft list for the [[Dutch general election, 1998|1998 election]]. The committee for candidacy stated that she "did not excel in parliamentary work,"{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} but because of the unexpectedly good election result for the GreenLeft she was re-elected. She also got a large number of [[voorkeursstem|preference votes]]. In 1998 she was a member of the parliamentary inquiry committee on the airplane crash in the [[Bijlmermeer]]. This position got her national fame.

=== Singh Varma Affair ===
In 2000 Singh Varma claimed that she was less able to perform her work as Member of Parliament. Twice she appeared in the House of Representatives in a wheelchair. She claimed to suffer from an incurable form of cancer and announced that she would leave the House of Representatives to prepare for the end of her life.

In June 2001 the [[TROS]] television show ''[[Opgelicht?!]]'' (in English ''Framed?!'') discovered that Singh Varma did not suffer from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tros.nl/index.php?id=1329 |title=Tara Singh Varma |accessdate=2008-02-02 |author= |work= |publisher=[[TROS]] Opgelicht? !|quote=In totaal tien mensen, van wie de meesten Tara Singh Varma heel goed kennen, verklaren tegenover Opgelicht ! dat ze niet in de ziekte geloven. Ze dragen een groot aantal dingen aan die daar op zouden wijzen. Een paar voorbeelden: op de dag dat Tara in een rolstoel naar de kamer ging, was haar voormalige vriendin die ochtend nog bij haar geweest. De avond daarvoor waren ze flink wezen stappen, en de avond nadat Tara met de rolstoel naar de kamer was gegaan was ze weer kiplekker.Wanneer mensen in haar directe omgeving naar haar behandelend artsen vroegen kregen ze nooit een direct antwoord. Ze noemde ooit drie artsen, maar twee van hen bestonden niet, en de derde kende haar niet.  Met een andere vriendin ging ze 's ochtends nadat ze volgens eigen zeggen een chemokuur had gehad, naar het reisbureau om een reis naar India te boeken. [...] Dit zou de gebeurtenis zijn die heeft geleid tot de ontdekking dat Tara Singh Varma kanker had. |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNPP2001"&gt;{{cite journal

First Singh Varma denied both claims and sued the journalists. In August 2001 she claimed that she had not suffered from cancer and instead suffered from [[post traumatic stress disorder]] after self-fabricated [[far right]] threats and her commitment to the victims of the plane crash in the Bijlmermeer. In 2002 she publicly apologized for her actions. She denied lying on purpose about her diseases and stated that she suffered from delusions and medical condition called [[pseudologia fantastica]].&lt;ref name="parlement.com"&gt;{{Cite web

== Life after politics ==
After leaving parliament Singh Varma became editor of the People's Newspaper Suriname around 2005. Later she worked in a Surinam deli.&lt;ref name="parlement.com"/&gt;

The rule is sometimes referred to as the '''Faith Cap''' on admissions.&lt;ref name=TES&gt;{{cite news |last=George |first=Martin |date=23 November 2017 |title=Bishops launch petition to lift faith school cap |url=https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/bishops-launch-petition-lift-faith-school-cap |work=TES |location= |access-date=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CT&gt;{{cite news |last=Davies |first=Madeleine |date=28 July 2017 |title=Faith cap ‘will not affect our schools’ |url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/28-july/news/uk/faith-cap-will-not-affect-our-schools |work=Church Times |location= |access-date=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the open places are just as accessible to faith applicants as non-faith applicants, in practice the rule does not explicitly prevent such schools from having more than 50% of students with a faith affiliation.&lt;ref name="ADA2638"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansard30April2014"/&gt;

The 50% Rule applies only to ''new'' academies, established under the [[Free school (England)|Free School]] programme, not to maintained schools that have converted to academy status.&lt;ref name="AdmissionsCode"&gt;{{cite web|title=School Admissions Code - December 2014|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==
[[David Laws#Return to government|David Laws, Schools Minister]] at the time the 50% Rule was introduced, described the motivation behind it in a Parliamentary debate.&lt;ref name="Hansard30April2014"/&gt;  He said: "Where the Government fund new Church or faith school provision, it is right that such new schools cater for local demand in the faith, but the needs of children in the broader local community must not be overlooked. We want all local children to have the same opportunity to access high-quality state-funded education. The fact that it is state funded is the point."

He went on to talk about the principle of parental choice, saying there are "two competing rights in a state-funded school system: people’s right to choose to have their children educated in the way that they wish, and the right of [other] taxpayers who live near state-funded schools to have some ability to access them despite the over-representation of people from the faith that the system allows."

== History ==
The 50% Rule was introduced by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|2010 Coalition Government]] formed from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].  In the run up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]], the Liberal Democrat manifesto had stated that "We will ensure that all faith schools develop an inclusive admissions policy."&lt;ref name="LibDemManifesto2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberal Democrat Manifesto 2010|url=http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge10/man/parties/libdem_manifesto_2010.pdf|publisher=Liberal Democrats|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aim was reflected in the [[Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|Coalition Agreement]] as follows: "We will ensure that all new Academies follow an inclusive admissions policy. We will work with faith groups to enable more faith schools and facilitate inclusive admissions policies in as many of these schools as possible."&lt;ref name="LibDemConsCoalitionAgreement"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Coalition: our programme  for government|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78977/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 50% Rule was first applied following the [[Academies Act 2010]], via a condition to the Funding Agreements for all new faith academies established under the Free School programme.&lt;ref name="FirstFreeSchools2011BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=The free schools set to open in 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-13810941|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=BBC|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later documented within the 2014 Schools Admissions Code.&lt;ref name="AdmissionsCode" /&gt;  The [[Michael Gove#Secretary of State for Education 2010–2014|Education Secretary, Michael Gove]], suggested that the rule should also be "voluntarily" applied to other types of new faith school.&lt;ref name="GoveGuardian30Mar2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paton|first1=Graeme|title=Gove backs 50pc limit on faith school admissions|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9176923/Gove-backs-50pc-limit-on-faith-school-admissions.html|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=The Guardian|date=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Education Service]] lobbied for removal of the 50% Rule, saying that they would not open any Free schools while it was in place.&lt;ref name="BCEWStatement2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement: Admissions to Catholic Schools|url=http://www.cbcew.org.uk/CBCEW-Home/The-Bishops/Bishops-Plenary-Meetings/Plenary-November-2013/School-Admissions|website=Birshops Conference of England and Wales|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph27Nov2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bingham|first1=John|title=Catholic Church snub to Michael Gove's flagship free schools plans|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9704078/Catholic-Church-snub-to-Michael-Goves-flagship-free-schools-plans.html|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=Telegraph|date=27 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph15Nov2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bingham|first1=John|title=Roman Catholic Church says no new academies over cap on believers|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10452994/Roman-Catholic-Church-says-no-new-academies-over-cap-on-believers.html|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=15 Nov 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TES4Feb2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barker|first1=Irena|title=Catholics won't invest in free schools and academies unless cap on believers is lifted|url=https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/catholics-wont-invest-free-schools-and-academies-unless-cap-believers|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=Times Educational Supplement|date=4 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheTablet2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamb|first1=Christopher|title=Bishops hope new Government will lift admissions cap on academies|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/2083/0/bishops-hopeful-new-conservative-government-will-lift-admissions-cap-on-academies|accessdate=27 August 2017|work=The Tablet|date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the issue was aired in the House of Commons in a debate led by [[Damian Hinds|Damian Hinds MP]].&lt;ref name="Hansard30April2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Commons Catholic Schools (Admissions) Debate 30 April 2014|url=http://catholicunion.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Catholic-Schools-admission-debate-30-Apr-2014.pdf|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coalition Government was replaced by a Conservative Government in the [[2015 General Election]]. The Schools Minister with responsibility for Free Schools, [[John Nash, Baron Nash|Lord Nash]], told campaigners that there were no plans to review the 50% Rule.&lt;ref name="LordNash2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=No plans to review 50% free schools admissions cap, says DfE|publisher=National Secular Society|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the following year, [[Nick Timothy]], the newly appointed director of the [[New Schools Network]], responsible for encouraging and supporting the establishment of Free Schools, spoke out in favour of ending it.&lt;ref name="NTimothyBBC2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coughlan|first1=Sean|title=Call to end limit on religious free schools|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35411525|accessdate=27 August 2017|work=BBC|date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Theresa May]] became Prime Minister in 2016, Nick Timothy became her Joint Chief of Staff,&lt;ref name="GuardianNickTimothy2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mason|first1=Rowena|title=May appoints former advisers as joint chiefs of staff|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/may-appoints-former-advisers-as-joint-chiefs-of-staff|accessdate=27 August 2017|work=The Guardian|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was credited as responsible when later the same year a national consultation by the Department for Education asked for people's views on removing the 50% Rule, to enable new faith academies to select up to 100% of pupils based on their faith.&lt;ref name="dfeconsultation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools that work for everyone|url=https://consult.education.gov.uk/school-frameworks/schools-that-work-for-everyone/|website=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PaulGoodmanSep2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Paul|title=The treatment of Catholic schools is a "burning injustice" – a wrong that May is now set to right|url=https://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2016/09/the-treatment-of-catholic-schools-is-a-burning-injustice-a-wrong-that-may-is-now-set-to-right.html|website=Conservativehome|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The move was opposed by individuals and groups campaigning for inclusive admissions, including the [[Accord Coalition]], [[Humanists UK]] and the [https://www.secularism.org.uk National Secular Society] as well as other commentators.&lt;ref name="AccordNov2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil society leaders urge Government to rethink removing 50% faith selection cap|url=http://accordcoalition.org.uk/2016/11/07/civil-society-leaders-urge-government-to-rethink-removing-50-faith-selection-cap/|publisher=Accord Coalition|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndependentJune2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romain|first1=Jonathan|title=At a time when social cohesion is needed more than ever, the Tories' pledge to ghettoise religious schools is shocking|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/general-election-2017-faith-schools-religious-50-percent-cap-segregation-a7770856.html|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=The Independent|date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph9Sep2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cantle|first1=Ted|title=Religious selection in school admissions is utterly deleterious for integration|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/09/09/religious-selection-in-school-admissions-is-utterly-deleterious/|accessdate=29 August 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HUKConsultationResponse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools that work for everyone: response of the British Humanist Association|url=https://humanism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016-12-12-FINAL-Schools-that-work-for-everyone-BHA-consultation-response.pdf|publisher=Humanists UK|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CEEJan2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Croft|first1=James|title=Should we allow faith selection?

This announcement means that Catholic dioceses will be able to open new Catholic schools for the first time in six years."&lt;ref name="CESAnnualReport2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 169th Annual Report of the Catholic Education Service (2016)|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org.uk/images/AnnualZReportZ2016ZFinal_2.pdf|publisher=Catholic Education Service|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in April 2017, before the results of the consultation were published, Theresa May called a [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|snap General Election]], with Nick Timothy as a senior advisor for her campaign.&lt;ref name="ITVElection2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Election 2017: Who are the key behind-the-scenes figures directing Tory and Labour campaigns?|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2017-04-19/election-2017-who-are-the-key-behind-the-scenes-figures-directing-tory-and-labour-campaigns/|accessdate=27 August 2017|work=ITV|date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their Conservative manifesto included a pledge to "replace the unfair and ineffective inclusivity rules that prevent the establishment of new Roman Catholic schools."&lt;ref name="ConManifesto2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Forward, Together -  Our Plan for a Stronger Britain and a Prosperous Future|url=https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/manifesto2017/Manifesto2017.pdf|publisher=The Conservative Party|accessdate=27 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615162039/https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/manifesto2017/Manifesto2017.pdf|archivedate=15 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, a Cabinet reshuffle resulted in the incumbent Education Secretary, [[Justine Greening]], being replaced by [[Damian Hinds]], whose record of supporting the Catholic Education Service's position on the 50% Rule fuelled speculation that he planned to implement the Government's manifesto pledge to remove it.&lt;ref name="DamianHindsJan2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whittaker|first1=Freddie|title=Damian Hinds: The new sheriff in town|url=https://schoolsweek.co.uk/damian-hinds-the-new-sheriff-in-town/|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=Schools Week|date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DamianHindsCatholicHerald"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hallett|first1=Nick|title=Church school supporter is new Education Secretary|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2018/01/09/church-school-supporter-is-new-education-secretary/|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=The Catholic Herald|date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, he confirmed that was his intention.&lt;ref name="DHindsFeb2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hepburn|first1=Henry|title=Grammar school expansion and faith school reforms: Damian Hinds sets out his stall|url=https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/grammar-school-expansion-and-faith-school-reforms-damian-hinds-sets|accessdate=19 February 2018|work=Times Educational Supplement|date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent22Feb2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Busby|first1=Eleanor|title=Parliamentary inquiry demanded over minister's plans to allow new faith schools to take fewer pupils from different backgrounds|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/faith-schools-religions-education-select-committee-parliamentary-inquiry-damian-hinds-selection-free-a8222021.html|accessdate=26 February 2018|work=Independent|date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SchoolsWeek23Feb2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whittaker|first1=Freddie|title=Catholics pray for free schools miracle|url=https://schoolsweek.co.uk/catholics-pray-for-free-schools-miracle/|accessdate=26 February 2018|work=Schools Week|date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in May 2018 it was announced that the 50% cap would remain in place.

== Application and Interpretation ==
===Catholic Free Schools===
The Catholic Education Service refused to support the establishment of new faith academies under the 50% Rule because they interpreted it as forcing schools "to turn pupils away because they were Catholics while admitting others because they were not".&lt;ref name="Telegraph27Nov2012" /&gt; They said that this would be against Canon Law,&lt;ref name="Tablet28Aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamble|first1=Rose|title=Church welcomes abolition of cap on faith-school admissions|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/6121/0/church-welcomes-abolition-of-cap-on-faith-school-admissions|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=The Tablet}}&lt;/ref&gt; although campaigners for inclusive admissions argued that their claim was "disingenuous and politically motivated".&lt;ref name="HumanistsUKBriefingOn50pcCap"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious lobbying around the 50% cap on religious selectio|url=https://humanism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016-11-17-BHA-briefing-Religious-lobbying-on-50-per-cent-cap.pdf|publisher=Humanist UK|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairperson of the CES has said: “The Church of England runs schools for the wider community .....

One Catholic Free School ''was'' established, [[St Michael's Secondary School|St Michael's in Camborne]], as a conversion from the private sector.  It originally received "one off" approval from church officials,&lt;ref name="FreebutFettered2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutcliffe|first1=Jeremy|title=Free but Fettered|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/features/2/677/free-but-fettered|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=The Tablet|date=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was later withdrawn and, after it failed to thrive, the school was eventually absorbed into a community academy.&lt;ref name="StMichaelsGuardianMay2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Richard|title=Fate of Cornwall's first free school hangs in balance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/may/01/fate-of-cornwalls-first-free-school-hangs-in-balance|accessdate=29 August 2017|work=The Guardian|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StMichaelsBBCMay2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Camborne's £4.5m St Michael's free school 'not viable'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-32763335|accessdate=29 August 2017|date=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While it was operating as a Catholic free school it was found to misinterpret the 50% Rule, because its oversubscription criteria prioritised 50% of places for "non-Catholics" rather than allocating them "without reference to faith".

Another Free School, [[Trinity Academy, Brixton|Trinity Academy]] in Brixton, opened without a formal Catholic designation (for which it would have needed the support of the church authorities),&lt;ref name="NSNFaithSchoolGuidance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Faith Free Schools Application Guidance|url=https://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/sites/default/files/Faith%20free%20schools.docx.pdf|website=New Schools Network|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with a Catholic ethos, and oversubscription criteria that allocated 100% of places without reference to faith.&lt;ref name="TrinityBrixton"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Trinity|url=http://www.trinityacademylondon.org/headteachers-welcome|website=Trinity Academy|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school's founder has spoken out against the Catholic Education Service's position on the 50% rule, describing it as "stubborn" and a missed opportunity for evangelism.&lt;ref name="SpectatorBlog28Sept2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Damian|title=The knives are out for Christian faith schools|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/07/the-knives-are-out-for-christian-faith-schools/|website=The Spectator|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[St Richard Reynolds Catholic College|St Richard Reynolds Catholic High School and Primary School]] were established in the London Borough of Richmond Upon Thames in 2013, campaign groups accused the local authority of helping the Catholic church to avoid the 50% Rule, by providing financial and political support for them to be set up as [[Voluntary aided school|Voluntary Aided schools]] rather than Free Schools, and setting a legal precedent for interpretation of [[Education Act 2011|2011 Education Act]].&lt;ref name="DWolfeDec2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolfe|first1=David|title=No longer a presumption that new schools will be academies?|url=http://davidwolfe.org.uk/wordpress/archives/1390|website=A Can of Worms|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RTTOct2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bishop|first1=Rachel|title=New Twickenham Catholic school named, despite High Court battle|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/9980383.New_Catholic_school_named__despite_High_Court_battle/|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=Richmond and Twickenham Times|date=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Education Secretary suggested that the school should "voluntarily" adhere to the 50% rule.&lt;ref name="GoveGuardian30Mar2012"/&gt;  In the end, the diocesan authorities did provide 10 open places in the primary school,&lt;ref name="LBRuTConsultation2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Consultation with Richmond upon Thames residents on use of the Clifden Road site, Twickenham|url=https://cabnet.richmond.gov.uk/documents/s33088/Cabinet%2024%20May%20re%20Clifden%20Road%20Appendix%201.pdf|publisher=London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, like St. Michaels in Camborne, they were also required by the Schools' Adjudicator to modify the wording of their policy to ensure that Catholic children could access the open places.&lt;ref name="AdjudicatorADA3114"&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision: St Richard Reynolds Catholic College|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/st-richard-reynolds-catholic-college|publisher=Office of the Schools' Adjudicator|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church of England Free Schools===
The Church of England (CE) is establishing large numbers of new schools under the Free School programme.&lt;ref name="Guardian10July2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherwood|first1=Harriet|title=Church of England is bidding to open scores of free schools|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/10/church-of-england-bidding-open-free-schools|accessdate=28 August 2017|date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FreeSchoolsWithFaithDes"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of free schools in England which are formally designated as faith schools|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/_List_of_free_schools_in_England_which_are_formally_designated_as_faith_schools|website=Wikipedia|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Justin Welby|Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby]], has said that the Church of England is moving away from selecting pupils based on religion.&lt;ref name="JustinWelby2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Philipson|first1=Alice|title=Church 'moving away' from selecting school pupils based on religion|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10448412/Church-moving-away-from-selecting-school-pupils-based-on-religion.html|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the proposal to remove the 50% Rule, their Chief Education Officer stated that “Our schools are not faith schools for the faithful, they are church schools for the community.”&lt;ref name="CofEConsultationResponse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Church of England responds to Government education proposals|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2016/09/church-of-england-responds-to-government-education-proposals.aspx|publisher=Church of England|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, campaign groups have said that the admissions authorities for CE schools frequently do not follow this advice.&lt;ref name="SchoolsWeekOnAccordReportNov2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen-Kinross|first1=Pippa|title=Church schools accused of ‘discriminatory’ admissions|url=https://schoolsweek.co.uk/church-schools-accused-of-discriminatory-admissions/|accessdate=21 November 2017|work=Schools Week|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Church of England free schools go beyond what is required by the 50% Rule and have oversubscription criteria which allocate 100% of places without reference to faith, in line with many of their established [[Voluntary controlled school|Voluntary Controlled schools]].&lt;ref name="StMarysHampton"&gt;{{cite web|title=St Mary's Hampton CE Primary School|url=http://www.stmaryshamptonschool.org.uk/|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WynyardPrimary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wynyard Church of England Primary School|url=http://wynyardprimary.org.uk/|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WalthamstowAdm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Admissions|url=http://www.walthamstowprimaryacademy.org.uk/Information/Admissions|website=Walthamstow Primary Academy|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One school's interpretation of the 50% Rule was judged to be unreasonable, because it designated Church of England primary schools, which themselves had faith-based admissions criteria, as feeder schools for the 50% of places that were being allocated without reference to faith.&lt;ref name="ADA3209"&gt;{{cite web|title=Determination ADA3209|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/becket-keys-church-of-england-school|publisher=Office of the Schools Adjudicator|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Government's consultation on removal of the 50% Rule, one proposed CE Free School apparently published plans for oversubscription criteria that selected only 25% of places without reference to faith, prompting criticism that people were "jumping the gun" in assuming the change would go ahead.  However, the school later said the policy description on their website had been incorrect.&lt;ref name="SchoolsWeek5April2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staufenberg|first1=Jess|title=Church of England school backs down on proposal for 75% faith places at free school|url=http://schoolsweek.co.uk/church-of-england-school-backs-down-on-proposal-for-75-faith-places-at-free-school/|accessdate=29 August 2017|work=Schools Week|date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Faith Free Schools===
The Free School programme has resulted in the establishment of many new schools with several faith designations, including other Christian denominations, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh and Muslim,&lt;ref name="FreeSchoolsWithFaithDes"/&gt; all of which are subject to the 50% Rule.

Some senior members of the Jewish community have publicly supported the removal of the 50% Rule.&lt;ref name="jc9Sep2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Theresa May to remove cap on faith-school admissions|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/theresa-may-to-remove-cap-on-faith-school-admissions-1.52973|accessdate=30 August 2017|work=Jewish Chronicle|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JNOnline9Sep2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Community welcomes plans to relax admission rules for Jewish schools|url=http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/community-welcomes-plans-to-relax-admission-rules-for-jewish-schools/|accessdate=30 August 2017|work=Jewish News Online|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The Government's 2016 consultation document "Schools that Work for Everyone", which was proposing removal of the 50% Rule, said that "in open free schools designated for minority faiths in the English school system (Islam, Judaism, Sikhism and Hinduism) the intake has been predominantly of pupils from similar ethnic backgrounds". They contrasted this with Voluntary Aided Catholic schools which they said have higher levels of diversity on average, despite not being subject to the 50% Rule.&lt;ref name="dfeconsultation"/&gt;

The same document said "“Other Christian” free schools have nearly a fifth of pupils of Asian origin and nearly a tenth from black ethnic families, with just 55% of White ethnic origin".

In response to the consultation, a campaign group in favour of retaining the 50% Rule published analysis indicating that schools subject to the rule are more ethnically diverse than those that aren't, concluding that "if the 50% cap was rolled out across all state-funded secondary schools then .. whilst there would be little difference for the minority faith schools, tens or even hundreds of thousands of non-white pupils would gain access to Christian schools when they haven’t had access before."&lt;ref name="HUKFreeSchoolDiversityPaper"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnic diversity in religious Free Schools|url=https://humanism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016-09-15-FINAL-Ethnic-diversity-in-religious-Free-Schools.pdf|website=Humanist UK|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9063">An '''unfair election''' is a concept used by national and international [[election]] monitoring groups to identify when the [[vote]] of the people for a [[government]] is not free and fair. Unfairness in elections encompasses all varieties of [[electoral fraud]], [[voter suppression]] or intimidation, unbalanced [[campaign finance]] rules, and imbalanced access to the media. Unfair elections violate the [[right to vote]], which is generally recognised as an essential element to a [[deliberative|Deliberative democracy]] and [[representative democracy]].

==History==
{{see also|History of democracy}}
Although some form of elections have been held since antiquity, in every society until 1893, large number of people were excluded based on their status, particularly slaves, poor, women, people with different skin colour, and people without formal education. The first democratic election in the modern sense was the [[New Zealand general election, 1893|1893 general election]] when women won the vote at the age of 21 like men, property qualifications were scrapped, and restrictions on [[Māori people|Maori]] people voting were discarded. In the United Kingdom, some form of representation in government had been guaranteed since the [[Magna Carta 1215]], but only for a tiny elite, and potentially vetoed by the Monarch. The Monarch's power was eliminated following the [[Glorious Revolution 1688]],&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Ashby v White]]'' (1703) 1 Sm LC (13th Edn) 253 right to vote cannot be interfered with by a public official.&lt;/ref&gt; and then elections became progressively more democratic. As [[Forty Shilling Freeholders|property qualifications]] were slowly phased out from [[Great Reform Act 1832|1832]] to in [[Representation of the People Act 1918|1918]], [[women's suffrage]] became non-discriminatory in [[Representation of the People Act 1928|1928]],&lt;ref&gt;It was even asserted (wrongly) by one judge that it was a principle of the English constitution that women would not vote ''[[Nairn v The University Court of the University of St Andrews]]'' (1907) 15 SLT 471, 473, per Lord McLaren, it is "a principle of the unwritten constitutional law of this country that men only were entitled to take part in the election of representatives to Parliament."&lt;/ref&gt; and the last vestiges of double voting were abolished in [[Representation of the People Act 1948|1948]].&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Second Reform Act 1867]] and [[Representation of the People Act 1883]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, elections for the Federal government were administered in each of the states. Around half of all successful [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendments]] since the [[Revolution of 1776]] concerned elections and the franchise. Slavery was abolished in [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|1865]], universal suffrage for men in the [[United States House of Representatives]] was achieved over [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|1868]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|1870]], direct elections to the Senate secured in [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|1913]], women won the vote in [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|1920]], and poll taxes levied by the states were banned in [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|1964]]. Around continental Europe, there were different speeds of progress. [[France]] had granted [[universal suffrage]] for men after the [[Revolutions of 1848]], but did not extend the vote to women until 1944. After the [[First World War]] in Germany, the new [[Weimar Republic]]'s constitution of 1919 guaranteed universal suffrage, overhauling the [[German Empire]]'s system of [[Prussian three-class franchise|three voting classes]] that depended on wealth, and its exclusion of women. However, democracy was abolished again in 1933 by the [[Nazi regime]] until the victory of the Allies in [[World War II]].

:'''''Article 21'''''
:1. Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.
:2. Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country.
:3. The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.|source=[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] 1948, article 21}}
In 1948, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] exhorted that "everyone has the right to take part in the government", that "the will of the people is the basis of the authority of government" and that "this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections." In the post war process of [[decolonialisation]], more and more countries became independent from the crumbling European Empires, and many introduced elections of some form, though many countries' transition slid abruptly back into authoritarian regimes. The [[Soviet Union]] and countries behind the [[Iron Curtain]] had no free elections, until the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989. After that a majority of countries around the world have moved toward democratic electoral systems, at least on paper.

Aside from simply denying the vote by outright discrimination, or by curtailing the power of the democratically elected body, interest groups or governments seeking to usurp or hold onto power employed a variety of methods. An early case of electoral fraud was in an election to the county of [[Northamptonshire]] in England in 1768, when three earls spent more than £100,000 each to buy votes from voters to win their seats.&lt;ref&gt;J Grego, ''A history of parliamentary elections and electioneering in the old days'' (1886) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8QNwwkg784C&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=spendthrift+election%22+came+in+Northamptonshire+in+1768,&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gVXBTe2BFcnliALW8KisAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=spendthrift%20election%22%20came%20in%20Northamptonshire%20in%201768%2C&amp;f=false 226-28]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voter intimidation]] was widespread in the [[German federal election, March 1933]], immediately before the Nazi party abolished Parliament's powers. Hitler had become Chancellor at the start of 1933 in a coalition agreement, and with control over the police, opposition party members and campaigners were beaten up and imprisoned throughout the voting process. As electoral systems became more mature, the focus of unfairness turned toward [[campaign finance]] and [[media bias]]. Almost every country in the developed world introduced limits on the amount that could be spent by any particular candidate in an election. The large exception was the [[United States]], because a majority of judges on the [[US Supreme Court]] who were appointed by the Republican Party continued to strike down campaign finance limits as unconstitutional from 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Buckley v Valeo]]''&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of countries also have some form of media regulation, so that news coverage has to be impartial and accurate in its treatment of political issues. Regulation may also extend to who owns news and television organisations, so that the power to grant access information channels is not unduly limited.

'''''Union Colliery Co of British Columbia v Bryden'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Union Colliery Company of British Columbia, Limited and others v John Bryden|link=|court=UKPC|year=1899|num=58|date=28 July 1899|parallelcite =[1899] AC 580|courtname=[[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|P.C.]]|juris=British Columbia|format = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a famous Canadian constitutional decision of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] where the exclusivity principle in [[Canadian federalism]] and [[pith and substance]] analysis was first articulated.

Bryden was a shareholder in Union Colliery, a coal mining company in British Columbia, and was troubled by the company's practice of employing "Chinamen" and putting them into positions of authority. He sought an injunction against the company for violating section 4 of the provincial Coal Mines Regulation Act of 1890, which prohibited hiring "Chinamen" to work in coal mines. Union Colliery challenged the constitutionality of Act, arguing that the prohibition related to matters of naturalization and was under the jurisdiction of the federal government under section 91(25) of the [[British North America Act, 1867]]. Bryden, however, argued that since the federal government had no laws covering the matter the province was allowed to step in and legislate on it. 

The issue before the Council was whether the provinces could legislate in matters under federal jurisdiction where the federal government has remained silent.

The Council held that the [[pith and substance]] of the provision was in relation to "aliens and naturalized subjects" and did fall within the federal jurisdiction. They also held that the federal government did not need to pass laws in all areas within their jurisdiction, and under the exclusivity principle the province can never intrude upon the federal jurisdiction. It is only where the two governments make an explicit agreement can the province legislate in federal matters.

It is considered to be Europe's most effective anti-[[Axis powers|Axis]] [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement]] during World War II, often compared to the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]], albeit the latter was a mostly non-communist autonomous movement.&lt;ref name="JJR2013_OxfordPress"&gt;[[Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones|Jeffreys-Jones, R.]] (2013): [https://books.google.com/books?id=3gK7e8LpXvcC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=Europe%27s+most+effective+Anti+Nazi+resistance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6eydUaOmMsbm4QTrsoCIBQ&amp;ved=0CC4QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=most%20effective%20Anti%20Nazi%20resistance&amp;f=false In Spies We Trust: The Story of Western Intelligence], Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-958097-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AS_2005"&gt;Adams, Simon (2005): [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cmm4J2Ug4o8C&amp;pg=PA1981&amp;dq=resistance+Europe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1u2dUZT5IKam4gSZ3YCwDQ&amp;ved=0CFMQuwUwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=resistance%20Europe&amp;f=false The Balkans], Black Rabbit Books, {{ISBN|978-1-58340-603-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav Resistance was led by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]]&lt;ref name="Dennison I.

Its commander was Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]].

==Objectives==
[[File:Zgrabimo oružje svi.jpg|thumb|right|"''To arms, everyone!''", a Partisan propaganda poster.]]
One of two objectives of the movement, which was the military arm of the [[Unitary National Liberation Front]] (UNOF) coalition, led by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ)&lt;ref name="Sharon Fisher 2006, p. 27"/&gt; and represented by the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] (AVNOJ), the Yugoslav wartime [[deliberative assembly]], was to fight the occupying forces. Until British supplies began to arrive in appreciable quantities in 1944, the occupiers were the only source of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.znaci.net/00001/3_1_2.htm|title=Basil Davidson: PARTISAN PICTURE|publisher=|accessdate=4 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305044520/http://www.znaci.net/00001/3_1_2.htm|archive-date=5 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other objective was to create a federal multi-ethnic [[communist state]] in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTomasevich2001|Tomasevich 2001]], p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, the KPJ attempted to appeal to all the various ethnic groups within Yugoslavia, by preserving the rights of each group.

The objectives of the rival resistance movement which emerged some weeks earlier, the [[Chetniks]], were the retention of the [[House of Karađorđević|Yugoslav monarchy]], ensuring the safety of ethnic [[Serb]] populations,&lt;ref&gt;[[Milazzo 1975|Milazzo (1975)]], pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberts 1973|Roberts (1973)]], p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and the establishment of a [[Greater Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp.166–178&lt;/ref&gt; through the [[ethnic cleansing]] of non-Serbs from territories they considered rightfully and historically Serbian.&lt;ref name="Banac 1996 p143"&gt;[[#Banac 1996|Banac (1996)]], p. 143&lt;br/&gt;"From the summer of 1941, the Chetniks increasingly gained control over Serb insurgents and carried out gruesome crimes against Muslims of eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Massacres of Muslims, usually by cutting the throats of the victims and tossing the bodies into various water-ways, occurred especially in eastern Bosnia, in Foča, Goražde, Čajniče, Rogatica, Višegrad, Vlasenica, Srebrenica, all in the basin of the Drina river, but also in eastern Herzegovina, where individual villages resisted Serb encirclement with ferocious determination until 1942. Chetnik documents&amp;nbsp;– for example the minutes of the Chetnik conference in Javorine, district of Kotor Varoš, in June 1942 – speak of a determination to 'cleanse Bosnia of everything that is not Serb'. It is difficult to estimate the number of Muslim victims of this original ethnic cleansing, but it can be counted in the tens of thousands."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirsch 2002 p76"&gt;[[#Hirsch 2002|Hirsch (2002)]], p.76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mulaj 2008 p71"&gt;[[#Mulaj 2008|Mulaj (2008)]], p.71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Velikonja_2003|Velikonja (2003)]], p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between the two movements were uneasy from the start, but from October 1941 they degenerated into full-scale conflict. To the Chetniks, Tito's pan-ethnic policies seemed anti-Serbian, whereas the Chetniks' [[royalism]] was anathema to the communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/partisan_fighters_01.shtml|title=Partisans: War in the Balkans 1941–1945|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128065207/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/partisan_fighters_01.shtml|archive-date=28 November 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of the war Partisan forces were predominantly composed of Serbs. In that period names of Muslim and Croat commanders of Partisan forces had to be changed to protect them from their predominantly Serb colleagues.&lt;ref name="Pinson1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Pinson|title=The Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina: Their Historic Development from the Middle Ages to the Dissolution of Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yl3TAkJmztYC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=2 October 2013|year=1996|publisher=Harvard CMES|isbn=978-0-932885-12-8|pages=143, 144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1944, the total forces of the Partisans numbered 650,000 men and women organized in four [[field army|field armies]] and 52 [[Division (military)|divisions]], which engaged in [[conventional warfare]].&lt;ref name=perica&gt;{{cite book|last=Perica|first=Vjekoslav| title=Balkan Idols: Religion and Nationalism in Yugoslav States|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004|page=96|isbn=0-19-517429-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1945, the Partisans numbered over 800,000.

==Name==
The movement was consistently referred to as the "Partisans" throughout the war. However, due to frequent changes in size and structural reorganizations, the Partisans throughout their history held four full official names:
*'''National Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia'''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{lang-sh|Narodnooslobodilački partizanski odredi Jugoslavije}} (NOPOJ), Народноослободилачки партизански одреди Југославије (НОПОЈ); {{lang-mk|Народноослободителни партизански одреди на Југославија (НПОЈ)}}; {{lang-sl|Narodnoosvobodilni partizanski odredi Jugoslavije}} (NOPOJ)&lt;/ref&gt; (June 1941 – January 1942)
*'''National Liberation Partisan and Volunteer Army of Yugoslavia'''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{lang-sh|Narodnooslobodilačka partizanska i dobrovoljačka vojska Jugoslavije}} (NOP i DVJ), Народноослободилачка партизанска и добровољачка војска Југославије (НОП и ДВЈ); {{lang-mk|Народноослободителна партизанска и волонтерска војска на Југославија (НОП и ВВЈ)}}; {{lang-sl|Narodnoosvobodilna partizanska in prostovoljna vojska Jugoslavije}} (NOP in PVJ)&lt;/ref&gt; (January – November 1942)
*'''National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia''' (November 1942 – February 1945). Increasingly from November 1942, the Partisan military as a whole was often referred to simply as the '''National Liberation Army''' (''Narodnooslobodilačka vojska,'' NOV), whereas the term "Partisans" acquired a wider sense in referring to the entire resistance faction (including, for example, the [[AVNOJ]]).
*'''Yugoslav Army''' &lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{lang-sh|Jugoslavenska armija}} (JA), Југословенска армија (ЈА); {{lang-mk|Југословенска армија (ЈА)}}; {{lang-sl|Jugoslovanska Armada}} (JA)&lt;/ref&gt; – on 1 March 1945, the National Liberation Army was transformed into the regular armed forces of Yugoslavia and renamed accordingly.
The movement was originally named National Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (''Narodnooslobodilački partizanski odredi Jugoslavije,'' NOPOJ) and held that name from June 1941 to January 1942. Because of this, their short name became simply the "Partisans" (capitalized), and stuck henceforward (the adjective "Yugoslav" is used sometimes in exclusively non-[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] sources to distinguish them from other [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] movements).

Between January 1942 and November 1942, the movement's full official name was briefly National Liberation Partisan and Volunteer Army of Yugoslavia (''Narodnooslobodilačka partizanska i dobrovoljačka vojska Jugoslavije,'' NOP i DVJ). The changes were meant to reflect the movement's character as a "volunteer army".

In November 1942 the movement was renamed into the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (''Narodnooslobodilačka vojska i partizanski odredi Jugoslavije,'' NOV i POJ), a name which it held until the end of the war. This last official name is the full name most associated with the Partisans, and reflects the fact that the proletarian brigades and other mobile units were organized into the National Liberation Army (''Narodnooslobodilačka vojska''). The name change also reflects the fact that the latter superseded in importance the partisan detachments themselves.

Shortly before the end of the war, in March 1945, all resistance forces were reorganized into the regular armed force of Yugoslavia and renamed Yugoslav Army. It would keep this name until 1951, when it was renamed the [[Yugoslav People's Army]].

==Background and origins==
[[File:Stjepan Stevo Filipović.jpg|thumb|upright|Partisan fighter [[Stjepan Filipović|Stjepan "Stevo" Filipović]] shouting "[[Death to fascism, freedom to the people]]!" seconds before his execution by a [[Serbian State Guard]] (local collaborator) unit in [[Valjevo]], occupied [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. These words became the Partisan slogan afterwards.]]
{{See also|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}

On 6 April 1941, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] from all sides by the Axis powers, primarily by [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces, but also including Italian, Hungarian and Bulgarian formations. During the invasion, [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|Belgrade was bombed]] by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]''. The invasion lasted little more than ten days, ending with the unconditional surrender of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] on 17 April. Besides being hopelessly ill-equipped when compared to the [[Wehrmacht]], the Army attempted to defend all borders but only managed to thinly spread the limited resources available.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tomasevich 1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], p.&amp;nbsp;64–70&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms of the capitulation were extremely severe, as the Axis proceeded to dismember Yugoslavia. Germany occupied northern [[Slovenia]], while retaining direct occupation over a [[wiktionary:rump state|rump]] [[Nedić's Serbia|Serbian state]] and considerable influence over its newly created [[puppet state]],&lt;ref name=britannica2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-1413183/Independent-State-of-Croatia|title=Independent State of Croatia|year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=15 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412145432/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-1413183/Independent-State-of-Croatia|archive-date=12 April 2008|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH), which extended over much of today's [[Croatia]] and contained all of modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Syrmia]] region of modern-day [[Serbia]]. Mussolini's [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] occupied the remainder of Slovenia (annexed and renamed as the [[Province of Ljubljana|Province of Lubiana]]), [[Kosovo]], and large chunks of the coastal [[Dalmatia]] region (along with nearly all its [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]] islands). It also gained control over the newly created [[Independent State of Montenegro|Montenegrin puppet state]], and was granted the kingship in the Independent State of Croatia, though wielding little real power within it. [[Kingdom of Hungary (Regency)|Hungary]] dispatched the [[Hungarian Third Army]] to [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944|occupy part of Serbian Vojvodina]], including [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]] and [[Bačka]], and annexed the Croatian area of [[Međimurje]] and the Slovene area of [[Prekmurje]]. [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Bulgaria]], meanwhile, annexed nearly all of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], and small areas of eastern Serbia and Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], pp. 61–63&lt;/ref&gt; The dissolution of Yugoslavia, the creation of the NDH, Independent State of Montenegro and [[Nedic's Serbia]] and the annexations of Yugoslav territory by the various Axis countries were incompatible with international law in force at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600054?OpenDocument|title=Commentary on Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Part III Status and treatment of protected persons, Section III, Occupied territories, Article 47 Inviolability of Rights|year=1952|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross, Geneva|accessdate=26 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107185619/http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600054?OpenDocument|archive-date=7 November 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Josip Broz Tito Bihać 1942.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Josip Broz Tito]] in [[Bihać]], 1942.]]
The occupying forces instituted such severe burdens on the local populace that the Partisans came not only to enjoy widespread support but for many were the only option for survival. Early in the occupation, German forces would hang or shoot indiscriminately, including women, children and the elderly, up to 100 local inhabitants for every one German soldier killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glenny |first=Misha |authorlink=Misha Glenny|page=485|date=1999 |title=The Balkans: Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804–1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the country experienced a breakdown of law and order, with collaborationist militias roaming the countryside terrorizing the population. The government of the puppet Independent State of Croatia found itself unable to control its territory in the early stages of the occupation, resulting in a severe crackdown by the [[Ustaše militia]]s and the German army.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Amid the relative chaos that ensued, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] moved to organize and unite anti-fascist factions and political forces into a nationwide uprising. The party, led by [[Josip Broz Tito]], was banned after its significant success in the post-World War I Yugoslav elections and operated underground since. Tito, however, could not act openly without the backing of the [[USSR]], and as the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]] was still in force, he was compelled to wait.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Formation and early rebellion==
[[Operation Barbarossa]], the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941.&lt;ref name= higgins&gt;{{cite book|title=Hitler and Russia|first=Trumbull|last=Higgins|publisher=The Macmillan Company|year=1966|pages=11–59, 98–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first communist military unit, the [[1st Sisak Partisan Detachment|Sisak Brigade]], was established on 22 June 1941, the day [[Nazi]] Germany invaded the [[Soviet Union]]. This was ignored in official Yugoslav historiography as it was not related to the Partisan movement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The first uprising, led by Tito, occurred two weeks later, in Serbia.&lt;ref name="cohen94"&gt;[[#refCohen1996|Cohen 1996]], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] formally decided to launch an armed uprising on 4 July, a date which was later marked as Fighter's Day – a public holiday in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. One [[Žikica Jovanović Španac]] shot the first bullet of the campaign on 7 July, later the Uprising Day of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]] (part of SFR Yugoslavia).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

On 10 August in Stanulović, a mountain village, the Partisans formed the Kopaonik Partisan Detachment Headquarters. The area they controlled, consisting of nearby villages, was called the "Miners Republic" and lasted 42 days. The resistance fighters formally joined the ranks of the Partisans later on. In 1941 Partisan forces in Serbia and Montenegro had around 55,000 fighters, but only 4,500 succeeded to escape to Bosnia.&lt;ref name="Ramet2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|title=The Three Yugoslavias: State-building and Legitimation, 1918–2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTw3lEqi2-oC&amp;pg=PA152|year=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-34656-8|page=153|quote=In 1941 Partisans had some 55,000 fighters in Serbia and Montenegro, but barely 4,500 Partisans had escaped to Bosnia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December 1941 they formed the [[1st Proletarian Brigade|1st Proletarian Assault Brigade]] (''1. Proleterska Udarna Brigada'') – the first regular Partisan military unit, capable of operating outside its local area. In 1942 Partisan detachments officially merged into the People's Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (NOV i POJ) with an estimated 236,000 soldiers in December 1942.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,885272,00.html|title=Foreign News: Partisan Boom|date=3 January 1944|work=Time|accessdate=15 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901165133/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,885272,00.html|archive-date=1 September 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of support for the Partisan movement varied according to region and nationality, reflecting the existential concerns of the local population and authorities. The first Partisan uprising occurred in Croatia on 22 June 1941, when forty Croatian Communists staged an uprising in the Brezovica woods between Sisak and Zagreb.&lt;ref name="cohen94"/&gt; In August 1941, 7 Partisan Detachments were formed in [[Dalmatia]] with the role of spreading the uprising. On 26 August 1941, 21 members of the [[1st Split Partisan Detachment]] were executed by firing squad after being captured by Italian and Ustashe forces.{{sfn|Kovač|Vojnović|1976|pp=367–372}}{{sfn|Kvesić|1960|pp=135–145}} An uprising occurred in Serbia two weeks later led by Tito ([[Uzice Republic]]), but it was quickly defeated by the Axis forces and support for the Partisans in Serbia thereafter dropped. Partisan numbers from Serbia would be diminished until 1943 when the Partisan movement gained upswing by spreading the fight against the axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart|first=Stephen|title=BBC History|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/partisan_fighters_01.shtml#two|work=Partisans: War in the Balkans 1941 – 1945|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128112138/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/partisan_fighters_01.shtml#two#two|archive-date=28 January 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increase of number of Partisans in Serbia, similarly to other republics, came partly in response to Tito's offer of amnesty to all collaborators on 17 August 1944.

It was a different story for Serbs in Axis occupied Croatia who turned to the multi-ethnic Partisans, or the Serb royalist Chetniks.&lt;ref name="Cohen 95"&gt;[[#refCohen1996|Cohen 1996]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Tim Judah]] notes that in the early stage of the war the initial preponderance of Serbs in the Partisans meant in effect a Serbian civil war had broken out.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJudah2000|Judah 2000]], p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar civil war existed within the Croatian national corpus with the competing national narratives provided by the Ustashi and Partisans.

===Resistance and retaliation===
{{See also|Seven anti-Partisan offensives}}
{{POV|section|date=July 2015}}
[[File:March of Time - Yugoslav Partisans.ogv|thumb|Yugoslav Partisans engaging in various activities.]]
The Partisans staged a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign which enjoyed gradually increased levels of success and support of the general populace, and succeeded in controlling large chunks of Yugoslav territory. These were managed via the "People's committees", organized to act as civilian governments in areas of the country controlled by the communists, even limited arms industries were set up. At the very beginning, Partisan forces were relatively small, poorly armed and without any infrastructure. They had two major advantages over other military and paramilitary formations in former Yugoslavia:
#A small but valuable cadre of [[Spanish Civil War]] veterans who, unlike anyone else at the time, had experience with modern war fought in circumstances quite similar to those of World War II Yugoslavia
#They were founded on ideology rather than [[ethnicity]], which meant the Partisans could expect at least some levels of support in any corner of the country, unlike other paramilitary formations whose support was limited to territories with Croat or Serb majorities. This allowed their units to be more mobile and fill their ranks with a larger pool of potential recruits.

Occupying and [[quisling]] forces, however, were quite aware of the Partisan threat, and attempted to destroy the resistance in what Yugoslav historiographers defined as seven major enemy offensives. These are:
*The [[First Enemy Offensive]], the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the "[[Republic of Užice]]", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western [[Serbia]]. In November 1941, [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roberts 1973|Roberts(1973)]], p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist [[Chetnik]] movement broke down and turned into open hostility.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tomasevich 1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 151–155&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Second Enemy Offensive]], the coordinated Axis attack conducted in January 1942 against Partisan forces in eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. The Partisan troops once again avoided encirclement and were forced to retreat over [[Igman]] mountain near [[Sarajevo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roberts 1973|Roberts(1973)]], p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Operation Trio|Third Enemy Offensive]], an offensive against Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia, [[Montenegro]], [[Sandžak]] and [[Herzegovina]] which took place in the spring of 1942. It was known as ''Operation TRIO'' by the Germans, and again ended with a timely Partisan escape.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roberts 1973|Roberts(1973)]], pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; This attack is mistakenly identified by some sources as the [[Battle of Kozara]], which took place in the summer of 1942.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
*The [[Fourth Enemy Offensive]], against "[[Republic of Bihać]]", also known as the Battle of the Neretva or ''Fall Weiss'' (Case White), a conflict spanning the area between western [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and northern [[Herzegovina]], and culminating in the Partisan retreat over the [[Neretva]] river. It took place from January to April 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roberts 1973|Roberts(1973)]], pp. 100–103&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Fifth Enemy Offensive]], also known as the Battle of the Sutjeska or ''Fall Schwarz'' (''Case Black''). The operation immediately followed the Fourth Offensive and included a complete encirclement of Partisan forces in southeastern Bosnia and northern Montenegro in May and June 1943.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
*The [[Sixth Enemy Offensive]], a series of operations undertaken by the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' and the ''[[Ustaše]]'' after the [[capitulation of Italy]] in an attempt to secure the [[Adriatic]] coast. It took place in late 1943 and early 1944.
*The [[Seventh Enemy Offensive]], the final attack in western Bosnia in the second quarter of 1944, which included ''Operation Rösselsprung'' (Knight's Leap), an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] and annihilate the leadership of the Partisan movement.

{{quote|It was the nature of partisan resistance that operations against it must either eliminate it altogether or leave it potentially stronger than before. This had been shown by the sequel to each of the previous five offensives from which, one after another, the partisan brigades and divisions had emerged stronger in experience and armament than they had been before, with the backing of a population which had come to see no alternative to resistance but death, imprisonment, or starvation. There could be no half-measures; the Germans left nothing behind them but a trail of ruin. What in other circumstances might possibly have remained the purely ideological war that reactionaries abroad said it was (and German propaganda did their utmost to support them) became a war for national preservation. So clear was this that no room was left for provincialism; Serbs and Croats and Slovenes, Macedonians, Bosnians, Christian and Moslem, Orthodox and Catholic, sank their differences in the sheer desperation of striving to remain alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.znaci.net/00001/3_2_8.htm Basil Davidson: PARTISAN PICTURE] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426114119/http://znaci.net/00001/3_2_8.htm |date=26 April 2013 }}, znaci.net; accessed 16 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Basil Davidson]]}}

===Allied support===

[[File:148 Squadron Halifax Italy WWII IWM CNA 3231.jpg|thumb|A Royal Air Force [[Halifax bomber]] of [[No. 148 Squadron RAF|148 Squadron]], loaded with parachute canisters containing supplies for the Yugoslav Partisans (1944–1945)]]
Later in the conflict the Partisans were able to win the moral, as well as limited material support of the western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], who until then had supported General [[Draža Mihailović]]'s Chetnik Forces, but were finally convinced of their collaboration fighting by many military missions dispatched to both sides during the course of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tito|last=Barnett|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Barnett|year=2006|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London, UK|isbn=1-904950-31-0|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To gather [[military intelligence|intelligence]], agents of the western Allies were infiltrated into both the Partisans and the Chetniks. The intelligence gathered by liaisons to the resistance groups was crucial to the success of supply missions and was the primary influence on Allied strategy in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The search for intelligence ultimately resulted in the demise of the [[Chetniks]] and their eclipse by Tito's Partisans. In 1942, although supplies were limited, token support was sent equally to each. The new year would bring a change. The Germans were executing [[Operation Schwarz]] (the Fifth anti-Partisan offensive), one of a series of offensives aimed at the resistance fighters, when F.W.D. Deakin was sent by the British to gather information.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

His reports contained two important observations. The first was that the Partisans were courageous and aggressive in battling the German [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Mountain]] and 104th Light Division, had suffered significant casualties, and required support. The second observation was that the entire German 1st Mountain Division had traveled from Russia by railway through Chetnik-controlled territory. British intercepts (ULTRA) of German message traffic confirmed Chetnik timidity. All in all, intelligence reports resulted in increased Allied interest in Yugoslavia air operations and shifted policy. In September 1943, at Churchill's request, Brigadier General [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]] was parachuted to Tito's headquarters near Drvar to serve as a permanent, formal liaison to the Partisans. While the Chetniks were still occasionally supplied, the Partisans received the bulk of all future support.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=David|title=Ally Betrayed: The Uncensored Story of Tito and Mihailovich|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|page=34|year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, after the [[Tehran Conference]] the Partisans received official recognition as the legitimate national liberation force by the Allies, who subsequently set up the [[RAF]] [[Balkan Air Force]] (under the influence and suggestion of Brigadier-General [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]]) with the aim to provide increased supplies and tactical air support for Marshal Tito's Partisan forces. During a meeting with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] of 24 November 1943, [[Winston Churchill]] pointed out that:{{quote|It was a lamentable fact that virtually no supplies had been conveyed by sea to the 222,000 followers of Tito.&amp;nbsp;... These stalwarts were holding as many Germans in Yugoslavia as the combined Anglo-American forces were holding in Italy south of Rome. The Germans had been thrown into some confusion after the collapse of Italy and the Patriots had gained control of large stretches of the coast. We had not, however, seized the opportunity. The Germans had recovered and were driving the Partisans out bit by bit. The main reason for this was the artificial line of responsibility which ran through the Balkans. (...&amp;nbsp;) Considering that the Partisans had given us such a generous measure of assistance at almost no cost to ourselves, it was of high importance to ensure that their resistance was maintained and not allowed to flag. |[[Winston Churchill]], 24 November 1943&lt;ref&gt;Walter R.

On 20 October, the Red Army and the Partisans liberated [[Belgrade]] in a joint operation known as the [[Belgrade Offensive]]. At the onset of winter, the Partisans effectively controlled the entire eastern half of Yugoslavia – Serbia, [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]], as well as the [[Dalmatia]]n coast.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 1945, the Partisans, numbering over 800,000 strong&lt;ref name=perica/&gt; defeated the [[Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia]] and the [[Wehrmacht]], achieving a hard-fought breakthrough in the [[Syrmia]]n front in late winter, taking [[Sarajevo]] in early April, and the rest of the NDH and Slovenia through mid-May. After taking [[Rijeka]] and [[Istria]], which were part of Italy before the war, they beat the Allies to [[Trieste]] by two days.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roberts_1973|Roberts (1973)]], p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; The "last battle of World War II in Europe", the [[Battle of Poljana]], was fought between the Partisans and retreating [[Wehrmacht]] and [[quisling]] forces at Poljana, near [[Prevalje]] in [[Slovenian Carinthia|Carinthia]], on 14–15 May 1945.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

 [[File:Flag of the Serbian Partisans.svg|thumb|right|Flag of Serbian Partisans used in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia and in areas of the Independent State of Croatia where Serbs lived.]]

The [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Axis invasion]] led to the division of Yugoslavia between the Axis powers and the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. The largest part of Serbia was organized into the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia]] and as such it was the only example of military regime in occupied Europe.{{sfn|Petranović|1992}} The Military Committee of the [[Provincial Committee for Serbia|Provincial Committee of the Communist Party for Serbia]] was formed in mid-May 1941. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia arrived in Belgrade in late May, and this was of great importance for the development of the resistance in Yugoslavia. After their arrival, the Central Committee held conferences with local party officials. The decision for preparing the struggle in Serbia issued on June 23, 1941 at the meeting of the Provincial Committee for Serbia. On July 5, a communist party proclamation appeared that called upon the Serbian people to struggle against the invaders. Western Serbia was chosen as the base of the [[Uprising in Serbia (1941)|uprising]], which later spread to other parts of Serbia. A [[Republic of Užice|short-lived republic]] was created in the liberated west, the first liberated territory in Europe. The uprising was suppressed by German forces by 29 November 1941. The [[Main National Liberation Committee for Serbia]] is believed to have been founded in Užice on 17 November 1941. It was the body of the Partisan resistance in Serbian territory.

The [[Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Serbia]] was held 9–12 November 1944.

Tito's post-war government built numerous [[List of Yugoslav World War II monuments and memorials in Serbia|monuments and memorials]] in Serbia after the war.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Serbian Partisan detachments entered Bosnian territory after the [[Operation Uzice]] which saw the [[Uprising in Serbia (1941)|Serbian uprising]] quelled. The Bosnian Partisans were heavily reduced during [[Operation Trio]] (1942) on the resistance in eastern Bosnia.

==Services==
[[File:BAF Vis Reviw.jpg|thumb|left|Aircraft and men of the [[Balkan Air Force]] during a review by Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]].]]
Aside from ground forces, the Yugoslav Partisans were the only [[resistance movement]] in occupied Europe to employ significant air and naval forces.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Partisan Navy===
Naval forces of the resistance were formed as early as 19 September 1942, when Partisans in [[Dalmatia]] formed their first naval unit made of fishing boats, which gradually evolved into a force able to engage the Italian Navy and [[Kriegsmarine]] and conduct complex amphibious operations. This event is considered to be the foundation of the [[Yugoslav Navy]]. At its peak during World War II, the Yugoslav Partisans' Navy commanded 9 or 10 armed ships, 30 patrol boats, close to 200 support ships, six coastal batteries, and several Partisan detachments on the islands, around 3,000 men.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} On 26 October 1943, it was organized first into four, and later into six, Maritime Coastal Sectors (''Pomorsko Obalni Sektor'', POS). The task of the naval forces was to secure supremacy at sea, organize defense of coast and islands, and attack enemy sea traffic and forces on the islands and along the coasts.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Partisan Air Force===
The Partisans gained an effective air force in May 1942, when the pilots of two aircraft belonging to the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] (French-designed and Yugoslav-built [[Potez 25]], and [[Breguet 19]] [[biplane]]s, themselves formerly of the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]]), [[Franjo Kluz]] and [[Rudi Čajavec]], defected to the Partisans in Bosnia.&lt;ref name= donlagic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Đonlagić|first1=Ahmet|last2=Atanacković|first2=Žarko|last3=Plenča|first3=Dušan|title=Yugoslavia in the Second World War|publisher=Međunarodna štampa Interpress|page= 85|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, these pilots used their aircraft against Axis forces in limited operations. Although short-lived due to a lack of infrastructure, this was the first instance of a resistance movement having its own air force. Later, the air force would be re-established and destroyed several times until its permanent institution. The Partisans later established a permanent air force by obtaining aircraft, equipment, and training from captured Axis aircraft, the British [[Royal Air Force]] (see [[Balkan Air Force|BAF]]), and later the [[Soviet Air Force]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Composition==
 [[File:IV crnogorska proleterska brigada.JPG|thumb|right|Soldiers of the 4th Montenegrin Proletarian Brigade]]
According to Tito, the national composition of the Partisan army in May 1944 was 44% Serb, 30% Croat, 10% Slovene, 5% Montenegrin, 2.5% Macedonian, and 2.5% Bosnian Muslim.&lt;ref name="Ramet 153"&gt;[[#refRamet2006|Ramet 1996]], p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Italians and Hungarians were also in the army: 20,000 Italian fighters were in [[9th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans)]], [[Partisan Battalion Pino Budicin]], [[Division Garibaldi]] and [[Division Italia]] later.&lt;ref&gt;Giacomo Scotti ''Ventimila caduti. Italiani in Iugoslavia 1943–45'', printed by Mursia in Milan, 1970: in page 492 there is text regarding division Italia&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In partitioned Yugoslavia, partisan resistance developed among the Slovenes in German-annexed Slovenia, engaging mostly in small-scale sabotage. In Serbia, a cetnik resistance organization developed under a former Yugoslav Army Colonel, Draža Mihailovic. After a disastrous defeat in an uprising in June 1941, this organization tended to withdraw from confrontation with the Axis occupying forces. The Communist-dominated Partisan organization under the leadership of Josef Tito was a multi-ethnic resistance force – including Serbs, Croats, Montenegrins, Bosniaks, Jews, and Slovenes. Based primarily in Bosnia and northwestern Serbia, Tito's Partisans fought the Germans and Italians most consistently and played a major role in driving the German forces out of Yugoslavia in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007332|title=Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|publisher=Ushmm.org|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120214424/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007332|archive-date=20 November 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Chetniks were a mainly Serb-oriented group and their Serb nationalism resulted in an inability to recruit or appeal to many non-Serbs. The Partisans played down communism in favour of a [[Popular Front]] approach which appealed to all Yugoslavs. In Bosnia, the Partisan rallying cry was for a country which was to be neither Serbian nor Croatian nor Muslim, but instead to be free and brotherly in which full equality of all groups would be ensured.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJudah2000|Judah 2000]], p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Serbs remained the dominant ethnic group in the Yugoslav Partisans throughout the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Century of genocide: critical essays and eyewitness accounts'', Samuel Totten, William S. Parsons, p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biljana Vankovska, Håkan Wiberg, ''Between past and future: civil-military relations in the post-communist Balkans'', p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chetnik ethnic cleansing policies against the Muslims in Eastern Bosnia, and Dalmatia alienated Croats and Muslims from joining the Chetniks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJudah2000|Judah 2000]], p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian collaboration with Chetniks in northern Dalmatia resulted in atrocities which further galvanized support for the Partisans among Dalmatian Croats. Chetnik attacks on Gala, near [[Split (city)|Split]], resulted in the slaughter of some 200 Croatian civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJudah2000|Judah 2000]], p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Mussolini's policy of forced [[Italianization]] ensured the first significant number of Croats joining the Partisans in late 1941. In other areas, recruitment of Croats was hindered by some Serbs' tendency to view the organisation as exclusively Serb, rejecting non-Serb members and raiding the villages of their Croat neighbours.&lt;ref name="Cohen 95"/&gt; A group of Jewish youths from Sarajevo attempted to join a Partisan detachment in Kalinovnik, but the Serbian Partisans turned them back to Sarajevo, where many were captured by the Axis forces and perished.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCohen1996|Cohen 1996]], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks from Croatian [[Ustaše]] on the Serbian population was considered to be one of the important reasons for the rise of guerrilla activities, thus aiding an ever-growing Partisan resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJudah2000|Judah 2000]], pp.&amp;nbsp;127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===

{{see also|Federal State of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Until early 1942, the Partisans in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who were almost exclusively Serbs, cooperated closely with the Chetniks, and some Partisans in eastern Herzegovina and western Bosnia refused to accept Muslims into their ranks. For many Muslims, the behavior of these Serb Partisans towards them meant that there was little difference for them between the Partisans and Chetniks. However, in some areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina the Partisans were successful in attracting both Muslims and Croats from the beginning, notably in the [[Kozara (mountain)|Kozara]] Mountain area in north-west Bosnia and the [[Romanija]] Mountain area near Sarajevo. In the Kozara area, Muslims and Croats made up 25 percent of Partisan strength by the end of 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tomasevich_2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], pp. 506–07&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hoare, by late 1943, 70% of the Partisans in Bosnia and Herzegovina were Serb and 30% were Croat and Muslim.&lt;ref name="Hoare 10"&gt;[[#refHoare2006|Hoare 2006]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of 1977, Bosnian recipients of war pensions were 64.1% Serb, 23% Muslim, and 8.8% Croat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoare|first=Marko|year=2002|title=Whose is the Partisan movement?

[[File:Partizanski plakat.jpg|thumb|right|Croatian Partisan poster: "''Everybody into the fight for the freedom of [[Croatia]]!''"]]
In 1941–42, the majority of Partisans in Croatia were Serbs, but by October 1943 the majority were Croats. This change was partly due to the decision of a key [[Croatian Peasant Party]] member, Božidar Magovac, to join the Partisans in June 1943, and partly due to the surrender of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tomasevich_2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], pp. 362–363&lt;/ref&gt; According to Goldstein, among Croatian partisans at the end of 1941, 77% were Serbs and 21.5% were Croats, and others as well as unknown nationalities. The percentage of Croats in the Partisans had increased to 32% by August 1942, and 34% by September 1943. After the capitulation of Italy, it increased further. At the end of 1944 there were 60.4% Croats, 28.6% Serbs and 11% of other nationalities (2.8% Muslims, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Italians, Hungarians, Czechs, Jews and ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'') in Croatian partisan units.&lt;ref name="Ramet 153"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein. ''Serbs and Croats in the national liberation war in Croatia''. , p.&amp;nbsp;266–267.&lt;/ref&gt; The Serb contribution to Croatian Partisans represented more than their proportion of the local population.&lt;ref name="Cohen 95"/&gt;&lt;ref name=strugar&gt;{{cite book|last=Strugar|first=Vlado|title=Jugoslavija 1941–1945|publisher= Vojnoizdavački zavod|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anić|first1=Nikola|last2= Joksimović|first2=Sekula|last3=Gutić|first3=Mirko|title=Narodnooslobodilačka vojska Jugoslavije| publisher=Vojnoistorijski institut|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vukovic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vuković| first1=Božidar|last2=Vidaković|first2=Josip|title=Putevim Glavnog štaba Hrvatske|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatian Partisans were integral to overall Yugoslav Partisans; by the end of 1943 Croatia proper, with 24% of the Yugoslav population, provided more Partisans than Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia and Macedonia combined which collectively accounted for 59% of the Yugoslav population.&lt;ref name="Cohen 95"/&gt; Croatian partisans were unique in having the highest numbers of local Jews in their ranks of any other European resistance, {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and in early 1943 they took steps to establish [[ZAVNOH]] (National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Croatia) to act as a parliamentary body for all of Croatia – the only one of its kind in occupied Europe. ZAVNOH held three plenary sessions during the war in areas which remained surrounded by Axis troops. At its fourth and last session, held on 24–25 July 1945 in Zagreb, ZAVNOH proclaimed itself as the Croatian Parliament or [[Sabor]].&lt;ref name=Jelic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jelic|first1=Ivan| title=Croatia in War and Revolution 1941–1945|publisher=[[Zagreb: Školska knjiga]]|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the liberated territories of Croatia after the war, Croatian Partisans proclaimed the Democratic Republic which was referred to by [[Winston Churchill]] as "the Croatian miracle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vuk-Pavlovic|first1=Stanimir|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/16/opinion/l-serbs-remember-who-sided-with-nazis-croatia-s-support-328491.html|newspaper=The New York TImes|publisher=NY Times|title=Serbs Remember Who Sided With Nazis; Croatia's Support|date=16 September 1991|accessdate=20 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307015208/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/16/opinion/l-serbs-remember-who-sided-with-nazis-croatia-s-support-328491.html|archive-date=7 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Slovenia was in a unique situation in Europe. Only Greece shared its experience of being trisected; however, Slovenia was the only country that experienced a further step – absorption and annexation into neighboring [[Nazi]] Germany, Fascist [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Joseph Kranjc (2013).

At the very beginning the Partisan forces were small, poorly armed and without any infrastructure, but [[Spanish Civil War]] veterans amongst them had some experience with [[guerrilla warfare]]. The Partisan movement in Slovenia functioned as the military arm of the [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation]], an Anti-Fascist resistance platform established in the [[Province of Ljubljana]] on 26 April 1941, which originally consisted of multiple groups of left wing orientation, most notable being Communist Party and Christian Socialists. During the course of the war, the influence of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]] started to grow, until its supremacy was officially sanctioned in the [[Dolomiti Declaration]] of 1 March 1943.&lt;ref name="Gow2010-48"&gt;{{cite book |title=Slovenia and the Slovenes: A Small State in the New Europe|last=Gow|first=James|author2=Carmichael, Cathie|edition=Revised and updated|year=2010|publisher=Hurst Publishers Ltd|isbn=978-1-85065-944-0|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the members of Liberation Front and partisans were ex-members of the [[TIGR]] resistance movement.

Representatives of all political groups in Liberation Front participated in Supreme Plenum of Liberation Front, which led the resistance efforts in Slovenia. Supreme Plenum was active until 3 October 1943 when, at the [[Kočevski zbor|Assembly of the Slovenian Nation's Delegates]] in Kočevje, the 120-member Liberation Front Plenum was elected as the supreme body of the Slovenian Liberation Front. The plenum also functioned as Slovenian National Liberation Committee, the supreme authority in Slovenia. Some historians consider the Kočevje Assembly to be the first Slovene elected parliament and Slovene Partisans as its representatives also participated on [[2nd session of the AVNOJ]] and were instrumental in adding the self-determination clause to the resolution on the establishment of a new federal Yugoslavia. The Liberation Front Plenum was renamed the [[SNOS|Slovenian National Liberation Council]] at the conference in Črnomelj on 19 February 1944 and transformed into the Slovenian parliament.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The Slovene Partisans retained their specific organizational structure and [[Slovene language]] as the commanding language until the last months of World War II, when their language was removed as the commanding language. From 1942 till after 1944, they wore the ''[[Triglavka]]'' cap, which was then gradually replaced with the ''[[Titovka (cap)|Titovka]]'' cap as part of their uniform.&lt;ref name="Vukšić2003"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SLix5hc4WRgC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22triglav+cap%22+partisan|title=Tito's partisans 1941–45|last=Vukšić|first=Velimir|date=July 2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-675-1|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1945, the Slovene Partisan Units were officially merged with the [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] and thus ceased to exist as a separate formation.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The partisan activities in Slovenia started in 1941 and were independent of Tito's partisans in the south. In autumn 1942, Tito attempted for the first time to control the Slovene resistance movement. [[Arsa Jovanović]], a leading Yugoslav communist who was sent from Tito's Supreme Command of Yugoslav partisan resistance, ended his mission to establish central control over the Slovene partisans unsuccessfully in April 1943. The merger of the Slovene Partisans with Tito's forces happened in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwBUkHaz76QC&amp;dq=James+Stewart.+%22Slovenia%22|title=Slovenia|last=Stewart|first=James|editor=Linda McQueen|publisher=New Holland Publishers|year=2006 |isbn=978-1-86011-336-9|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORSMBFwjAKcC&amp;dq=The+former+Yugoslavia%27s+diverse+peoples:+a+reference+sourcebook&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The former Yugoslavia's diverse peoples: a reference sourcebook|chapter=Histories of the Individual Yugoslav Nations|publisher=ABC-Clio, Inc|year=2004|pages=167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1943, [[Franja Partisan Hospital]] was built in difficult and rugged terrain, only a few hours from Austria and the central parts of Germany. The partisans broadcast their own radio program called ''Radio Kričač'', the location of which never became known to occupying forces, although the receiver antennas from the local population had been confiscated.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Rescue operations==
The Partisans were responsible for the successful and sustained evacuation of downed Allied airmen from the Balkans. For example, between 1 January and 15 October 1944, according to statistics compiled by the US Air Force Air Crew Rescue Unit, 1,152 American airmen were airlifted from Yugoslavia, 795 with Partisan assistance and 356 with the help of the Chetniks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leary|first=William Matthew|title=Fueling the Fires of Resistance: Army Air Forces Special Operations in the Balkans during World War II|year=1995|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=0-16-061364-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yugoslav Partisans in Slovene territory rescued 303 American airmen, 389 British airmen and prisoners of war, and 120 French and other prisoners of war and slave laborers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTomasevich2001|Tomasevich 2001]], p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Partisans also assisted hundreds of Allied soldiers who succeeded in escaping from German POW camps (mostly in southern Austria) throughout the war, but especially from 1943–45. These were transported across Slovenia, from where many were airlifted from [[Semič]], while others made the longer overland trek down through Croatia for a boat passage to [[Bari]] in Italy. In the spring of 1944, the British military mission in Slovenia reported that there was a "steady, slow trickle" of escapes from these camps. They were being assisted by local civilians, and on contacting Partisans on the general line of the River [[Drava]], they were able to make their way to safety with Partisan guides.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Raid at Ožbalt===
{{Main article|Raid at Ožbalt}}
A total of 132 Allied prisoners of war were rescued from the Germans by the Partisans in a single operation in August 1944 in what is known as the [[Raid at Ožbalt]]. In June 1944, the Allied escape organization began to take an active interest in assisting prisoners from camps in southern Austria and evacuating them through Yugoslavia. A post of the Allied mission in northern [[Slovenia]] had found that at [[Ožbalt]], just on the Austrian side of the border, about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Maribor]], there was a poorly guarded working camp from which a raid by [[Slovene Partisans]] could free all the prisoners. Over 100 POWs were transported from [[Stalag XVIII-D]] at [[Maribor]] to Ožbalt each morning to do railway maintenance work, and returned to their quarters in the evening. Contact was made between Partisans and the prisoners with the result that at the end of August a group of seven slipped away past a sleeping guard at 15:00, and at 21:00 the men were celebrating with the Partisans in a village, {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} away on the Yugoslav side of the border.&lt;ref name=mason&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Walter W.|last2=Kippenberger|first2=Howard K.|title= Prisoners of War|publisher=Historical Publications Branch|page=383|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven escapees arranged with the Partisans for the rest of the camp to be freed the following day. Next morning, the seven returned with about a hundred Partisans to await the arrival of the work-party by the usual train. As soon as work had begun the Partisans, to quote a New Zealand eye-witness, "swooped down the hillside and disarmed the eighteen guards". In a short time prisoners, guards, and civilian overseers were being escorted along the route used by the first seven prisoners the previous evening. At the first headquarters camp reached, details were taken of the total of 132 escaped prisoners for transmission by radio to England. Progress along the evacuation route south was difficult, as German patrols were very active. A night ambush by one such patrol caused the loss of two prisoners and two of the escort. Eventually they reached [[Semič]], in [[White Carniola]], Slovenia, which was a Partisan base catering for POWs. They were flown across to [[Bari]] on 21 September 1944 from the airport of [[Otok, Metlika|Otok]] near [[Gradac, Metlika|Gradac]].&lt;ref name=mason/&gt;

==Post-war==
{{Main article|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
SFR Yugoslavia was one of only two European countries that were largely liberated by its own forces during World War II. It received significant assistance from the Soviet Union during the [[Belgrade Offensive|liberation of Serbia]], and substantial assistance from the [[Balkan Air Force]] from mid-1944, but only limited assistance, mainly from the British, prior to 1944. At the end of the war no foreign troops were stationed on its soil. Partly as a result, the country found itself halfway between the two camps at the onset of the [[Cold War]].

In 1947–48, the Soviet Union attempted to command obedience from Yugoslavia, primarily on issues of foreign policy, which resulted in the [[Tito-Stalin split]] and almost ignited an armed conflict. A period of very cool relations with the Soviet Union followed, during which the U.S. and the UK considered courting Yugoslavia into the newly formed [[NATO]]. This however changed in 1953 with the Trieste crisis, a tense dispute between Yugoslavia and the Western Allies over the eventual Yugoslav-Italian border (see [[Free Territory of Trieste]]), and with Yugoslav-Soviet reconciliation in 1956. This ambivalent position at the start of the Cold War matured into the [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] foreign policy which Yugoslavia actively espoused until its dissolution.

===Reprisals===
A number of Partisan units, and the local population in some areas, engaged in [[Allied war crimes during World War II#Yugoslavia|mass murder]] in the immediate postwar period against [[POW]]s and other perceived Axis sympathizers, collaborators, and/or fascists along with their relatives, including children. These infamous massacres include the [[Bleiburg repatriations]], the [[Foibe massacres]], [[Tezno massacre]], [[Macelj massacre]], [[Kočevski Rog massacre]], [[Barbara Pit massacre]] and the [[communist purges in Serbia in 1944–45]].

The repatriations at Bleiburg (although scholars disagree on how many people died and no number has been officially recognized or agreed upon) of retreating columns of [[Chetnik]] and [[Slovene Home Guard]] troops, and soldiers of the [[Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia]] and thousands of civilians heading or retreating towards Austria to surrender to western Allied forces, have been called a "massacre". The "foibe massacres" draw their name from the "foibe" pits in which Croatian Partisans of the [[8th Dalmatian Corps]] (often along with groups of angry civilian locals) shot Italian fascists, and suspected collaborationists and/or separatists. According to a mixed Slovene-Italian historical commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kozina.com/premik/indexeng_porocilo.htm|title=Slovene-Italian historical commission|publisher=Kozina.com|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1993, which investigated only on what happened in places included in present-day Italy and Slovenia, the killings seemed to proceed from endeavors to remove persons linked with fascism (regardless of their personal responsibility), and endeavors to carry out mass executions of real, potential or only alleged opponents of the Communist government. The [[1944-1945 killings in Bačka]] were similar in nature and entailed the killing of suspected Hungarian, German and Serbian fascists, and their suspected affiliates, without regard to their personal responsibility. During this purge, a large number of civilians from the associated ethnic group were also killed.&lt;ref&gt;Márton Matuska. ''Days of Revenge''. Forum Publisher, Novi Sad, 1991.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Partisans did not have an official agenda of liquidating their enemies and their cardinal ideal was the "[[brotherhood and unity]]" of all Yugoslav nations (the phrase became the motto for the new Yugoslavia). The country suffered between 900,000 and 1,150,000 civilian and military dead during the Axis occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], p. 737&lt;/ref&gt; Between 80,000 and 100,000 people were killed in the partisan purges and at least 30,000 people were killed in the Bleiburg killings, according to Marcus Tanner in his work, ''Croatia: a Nation Forged in War''.

This chapter of Partisan history was a taboo subject for conversation in the [[SFR Yugoslavia]] until the late 1980s, and as a result, decades of official silence created a reaction in the form of numerous data manipulation for nationalist propaganda purposes.&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=David B.|title=Balkan Holocausts?: Serbian and Croatian Victim Centred Propaganda and the War in Yugoslavia|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=2002|isbn=0-7190-6467-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
The first small arms for the Partisans were acquired from the defeated [[Royal Yugoslav Army]], like the [[M24 series|M24 Mauser rifle]]. Throughout the war the Partisans used any weapons they could find, mostly weapons captured from the [[Wehrmacht|Germans]], [[Royal Italian Army|Italians]], [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Army of the NDH]], [[Ustaše]] and the [[Chetniks]], such as the [[Karabiner 98k]] rifle, [[MP 40]] submachine gun, [[MG 34]] machine gun, [[Carcano]] rifles and carbines and [[Beretta]] submachine guns. The other way that the Partisans acquired weapons was from supplies given to them by the [[Soviet Union]] and the United Kingdom, including the [[PPSh-41]] and the [[Sten]] MKII submachine guns respectively. Additionally, Partisan workshops created their own weapons modelled on factory-made weapons already in use, including the so-called "[[Partisan rifle]]" and the anti-tank "[[Partisan mortar]]".

The Yugoslav Partisans mobilized many women.&lt;ref name="BatinićHistory2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jelena Batinić|author2=Stanford University. Dept. of History|title=Gender, revolution, and war: the mobilization of women in the Yugoslav Partisan resistance during world war II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NIpEAQAAIAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav National Liberation Movement claimed 6,000,000 civilian supporters; its two million women formed the [[Women's Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia|Antifascist Front of Women]] (AFŽ), in which the revolutionary coexisted with the traditional. The AFŽ managed schools, hospitals and even local governments.  About 100,000 women served with 600,000 men in Tito's Yugoslav National Liberation Army. It stressed its dedication to women's rights and gender equality and used the imagery of traditional folklore heroines to attract and legitimize the partizanka (Partisan Woman).&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jancar, "Women in the Yugoslav National Liberation Movement: An Overview," ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' (1981) 14#2 pp&amp;nbsp;143–164.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, women returned to traditional gender roles, but Yugoslavia is unique as its historians paid extensive attention to women's roles in the resistance, until the country broke up in the 1990s. Then the memory of the women soldiers faded away.&lt;ref&gt;Vesna Drapac, "Resistance and the Politics of Daily Life in Hitler's Europe: The Case of Yugoslavia in a Comparative Perspective," ''Aspasia'' 2009 3: 55–78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jancar-Webster, ''Women and Revolution in Yugoslavia 1941–1945'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural legacy==
According to [[Vladimir Dedijer]], more than 40,000 works of folk poetry were inspired by the Partisans.&lt;ref name=dedijer&gt;{{cite book|last=Dedijer|first=Vladimir|title=Novi prilozi za biografiju Josipa Broza Tita|publisher=Mladost|year=1980|page=929}}&lt;/ref&gt;
