      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1505">'''Animal digest''' is a common ingredient used in [[pet food]]s.  As defined by the [[Association of American Feed Control Officials]], digest is produced by the chemical or enzymatic [[hydrolysis]] of clean animal tissue that has not undergone decomposition. These animal tissues may not include [[hair]], [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s, [[teeth]], [[hooves]], or [[feathers]], with the exclusion of trace amounts that are unavoidable even after acceptable processing methods.&lt;ref name="Digest"&gt;[https://agr.wa.gov/FP/Pubs/docs/282-AnimalProteinsProhibitedInRuminantFeedAndCattleMaterialsProhibitedInAllAnimalFeed.pdf Animal Proteins Prohibited in Ruminant Feed &amp; Cattle Materials Prohibited in All Animal Feed], WSDA.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), a digest is an additive that has been treated with heat, [[enzymes]], or also acids to produce a concentrated product intended as a natural [[Flavor|flavoring]]. Pet food may legally be labelled as "Chicken Flavored" regardless of the percentage of chicken-derived product it contains, so long as the chicken flavoring is deemed "perceptible."{{cn|date=December 2017}}

If a product is labeled as "flavored" by a certain type of meat, the digest it contains must have been produced from tissues pertaining to the listed animal species. Chicken flavored food must be flavored with chicken digest.&lt;ref name="Digest" /&gt;

[[Image:Bioreporter.jpg|thumb|361px|right|'''Anatomy of a bioreporter organism.''' Upon exposure to a specific analyte, the promoter/reporter gene complex is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translated into a reporter protein that is ultimately responsible for generating a signal.]]

'''Bioreporters''' are intact, living [[microbial]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that have been [[genetically engineered]] to produce a measurable signal in response to a specific chemical or physical agent in their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].  Bioreporters contain two essential genetic elements, a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] gene and a [[reporter gene]].  The promoter gene is turned on ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]) when the target agent is present in the cell’s environment.  The promoter gene in a normal bacterial cell is linked to other genes that are then likewise transcribed and then translated into proteins that help the cell in either combating or adapting to the agent to which it has been exposed.  In the case of a bioreporter, these genes, or portions thereof, have been removed and replaced with a reporter gene.  Consequently, turning on the promoter gene now causes the reporter gene to be turned on.  Activation of the reporter gene leads to production of reporter [[proteins]] that ultimately generate some type of a detectable signal.  Therefore, the presence of a signal indicates that the bioreporter has sensed a particular target agent in its environment.

Originally developed for fundamental analysis of factors affecting [[gene expression]], bioreporters were early on applied for the detection of environmental contaminants&lt;ref&gt;King, J.M.H. et al. (1990) Rapid, sensitive bioluminescence reporter technology for naphthalene exposure and biodegradation. Science 249, 778-781.http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/249/4970/778?ck=nck&lt;/ref&gt; and have since evolved into fields as diverse as [[medical diagnosis|medical diagnostics]], [[precision agriculture]], [[food safety]] assurance, process monitoring and control, and bio-[[microelectronic]] computing.  Their versatility stems from the fact that there exist a large number of [[reporter gene]] systems that are capable of generating a variety of signals.  Additionally, reporter genes can be genetically inserted into [[bacterial]], [[yeast]], [[plant]], and [[mammalian]] cells, thereby providing considerable functionality over a wide range of host vectors.

==Reporter gene systems==

Several types of reporter genes are available for use in the construction of bioreporter organisms, and the signals they generate can usually be categorized as either [[colorimetric]], [[fluorescent]], [[luminescent]], [[chemiluminescent]] or [[electrochemical]].  Although each functions differently, their end product always remains the same – a measurable signal that is proportional to the concentration of the unique chemical or physical agent to which they have been exposed.  In some instances, the signal only occurs when a secondary [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] is added to the [[bioassay]] (''luxAB'', Luc, and aequorin).  For other bioreporters, the signal must be activated by an external light source (GFP and UMT), and for a select few bioreporters, the signal is completely self-induced, with no exogenous substrate or external activation being required (''luxCDABE'').  The following sections outline in brief some of the reporter gene systems available and their existing applications.

===Bacterial luciferase (Lux)===

[[Image:Biolumplate.jpg|thumb|180px|right| Bioluminescence emitted from colonies of microbial cells containing the genes for bacterial luciferase.]]

[[Luciferase]] is a generic name for an [[enzyme]] that [[catalyzes]] a light-emitting reaction.  Luciferases can be found in bacteria, algae, fungi, jellyfish, insects, shrimp, and squid, and the resulting light that these organisms produce is termed bioluminescence.  In bacteria, the genes responsible for the light-emitting reaction (the ''lux'' genes) have been isolated and used extensively in the construction of bioreporters that emit a blue-green light with a maximum intensity at 490&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;Meighen, E.A. (1994) Genetics of bacterial bioluminescence. Annu. Rev. Genet. 28, 117-139. http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ge.28.120194.001001&lt;/ref&gt;  Three variants of ''lux'' are available, one that functions at &lt; 30°C, another at &lt; 37°C, and a third at &lt; 45°C.  The ''lux'' genetic system consists of five genes, ''luxA'', ''luxB'', ''luxC'', ''luxD'', and ''luxE''.  Depending on the combination of these genes used, several different types of [[bioluminescent]] bioreporters can be constructed.

===''luxAB'' Bioreporters===

''luxAB'' bioreporters contain only the ''luxA'' and ''luxB'' genes, which together are responsible for generating the light signal.  However, to fully complete the light-emitting reaction, a [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] must be supplied to the cell.  Typically, this occurs through the addition of the chemical [[decanal]] at some point during the bioassay procedure.  Numerous ''luxAB'' bioreporters have been constructed within bacterial, yeast, insect, nematode, plant, and mammalian cell systems.

===''luxCDABE'' Bioreporters===

Instead of containing only the ''luxA'' and ''luxB'' genes, bioreporters can contain all five [[genes]] of the ''lux'' cassette, thereby allowing for a completely independent light generating system that requires no extraneous additions of substrate nor any [[Excited state|excitation]] by an external light source.  So in this bioassay, the bioreporter is simply exposed to a target [[analyte]] and a [[quantitative property|quantitative]] increase in bioluminescence results, often within less than one hour.  Due to their rapidity and ease of use, along with the ability to perform the bioassay repetitively in [[real-time data|real time]] and on-line, makes ''luxCDABE'' bioreporters extremely attractive.  Consequently, they have been incorporated into a diverse array of detection methodologies ranging from the sensing of environmental contaminants to the real-time monitoring of pathogen infections in living mice.

===Nonspecific ''lux'' Bioreporters===

Nonspecific ''lux'' bioreporters are typically used for the detection of chemical toxins.  They are usually designed to continuously bioluminesce.  Upon exposure to a chemical toxin, either the cell dies or its metabolic activity is retarded, leading to a decrease in [[bioluminescent]] light levels.  Their most familiar application is in the Microtox [http://www.modernwater.co.uk/monitoring/toxicity/] assay where, following a short exposure to several concentrations of the sample, the decreased [[bioluminescence]] can be correlated to relative levels of [[toxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermens, J. et al. (1985) Quantitative structure-activity relationships and mixture toxicity of organic chemicals in Photobacterium phosphoreum: the Microtox test. Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf. 9, 17-25. http://www.springerlink.com/content/m67248753tkj1111/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firefly luciferase (Luc)===

[[Firefly luciferase]] catalyzes a reaction that produces visible light in the 550 – 575&amp;nbsp;nm range.  A click-beetle luciferase is also available that produces light at a peak closer to 595&amp;nbsp;nm.  Both luciferases require the addition of an exogenous substrate (luciferin) for the light reaction to occur.  Numerous ''luc''-based bioreporters have been constructed for the detection of a wide array of [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] and [[organic compound]]s of environmental concern.  The most promising applications, however, probably rely on introducing the genetic code of the firefly luciferase into other eukaryotic cells and tissues. 

====Medical diagnostics====
Insertion of the ''luc'' genes into a human cervical carcinoma cell line ([[HeLa]]) illustrated that tumor-cell clearance could be visualized within a living mouse by simply scanning with a charge-coupled device camera, allowing for [[chemotherapy]] treatment to rapidly be monitored on-line and in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;Contag, C.H. et al. (2000) Use of reporter genes for optical measurements of neoplastic disease in vivo. Neoplasia 2 (1-2), 41-52. http://neoreviews.aappublications.org/cgi/content/extract/1/12/e225&lt;/ref&gt;  In another example, the ''luc'' genes were inserted into human breast cancer cell lines to develop a bioassay for the detection and measurement of substances with potential [[estrogenic]] and antiestrogenic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Legler, J. et al. (1999) Development of a stably transfected estrogen receptor-mediated luciferase reporter gene assay in the human T47D breast cancer cell line. Toxicol. Sci. 48 (1), 55-66. http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/48/1/55&lt;/ref&gt;

====Research on gene regulation====
Particular [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] can be placed upstream of the ''luc'' gene, that is, the ''luc'' sequence can be fused to the promoter sequence at DNA level. If such construct is not too large in size, it can simply be introduced into eukaryotic cells using [[plasmids]]. This approach is widely used to study the activity of a given promoter in a given cell/tissue type, since the amount of light produced by the luciferase is directly proportional to the promoter activity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovács KA, Steinmann M, Halfon O, Magistretti PJ, Cardinaux JR | title = C/EBPbeta couples dopamine signalling to substance P precursor gene expression in striatal neurones. | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 98 | issue = 5 | pages = 1390-9 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16771829 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03957.x  }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to studying the promoters, firefly luciferase assays offer the option of studying [[transcriptional activators]]: in these experiments typically the [[GAL4/UAS_system]] is used and its Gal4 upstream activating DNA sequence (UAS) is placed upstream the ''luc'' gene while the different activators or the different variants/fragments of the same activator are fused to the GAL4 DNA binding module at protein level. This way the transcriptional activity of the different GAL4 fusion proteins can be directly compared using light as a readout. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovács KA, Steinmann M, Halfon O, Magistretti PJ, Cardinaux JR | title = Complex regulation of CREB-binding protein by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 | journal = Cellular Signalling | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 2252–60 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26247811 | doi = 10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.08.001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Aequorin===

[[Aequorin]] is a photoprotein isolated from the bioluminescent jellyfish ''[[Aequorea victoria]]''.  Upon addition of [[calcium]] ions (Ca2+) and coelenterazine, a reaction occurs whose end result is the generation of blue light in the 460 - 470&amp;nbsp;nm range.  Aequorin has been incorporated into human [[B cell]] lines for the detection of [[pathogenic]] bacteria and viruses in what is referred to as the [[Cell CANARY]] assay (Cellular Analysis and Notification of Antigen Risks and Yields).&lt;ref&gt;Rider, T. et al. (1999) In NASA/NCI Biomedical Imaging Symposium.&lt;/ref&gt;  The B cells are genetically engineered to produce aequorin.  Upon exposure to antigens of different pathogens, the recombinant B cells emit light as a result of activation of an intracellular signaling cascade that releases calcium ions inside the cell.

===Green fluorescent protein (GFP)===

[[Green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) is also a photoprotein isolated and cloned from the jellyfish ''[[Aequorea victoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Misteli, T. and Spector, D.L. (1997) Application of the green fluorescent protein in cell biology and biotechnology. Nat. Biotechnol. 15, 961-964.&lt;/ref&gt;  Variants have also been isolated from the sea pansy ''[[Renilla reniformis]]''.  GFP, like aequorin, produces a blue fluorescent signal, but without the required addition of an exogenous substrate.  All that is required is an [[ultraviolet light]] source to activate the fluorescent properties of the photoprotein.  This ability to autofluoresce makes GFP highly desirable in biosensing assays since it can be used on-line and in to monitor intact, living cells.  Additionally, the ability to alter GFP to produce light emissions besides blue (i.e., cyan, red, and yellow) allows it to be used as a multianalyte detector.  Consequently, GFP has been used extensively in bioreporter constructs within bacterial, yeast, nematode, plant, and mammalian hosts.

===Uroporphyrinogen (urogen) III methyltransferase (UMT)===

[[Uroporphyrinogen (urogen) III methyltransferase]] (UMT) catalyzes a reaction that yields two [[fluorescent]] products which produce a red-orange fluorescence in the 590 - 770&amp;nbsp;nm range when illuminated with [[ultraviolet light]].&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, I. et al. (1995) Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the uroporphyrinogen-III methyltransferase cobA gene of Propionibacterium freudenreichii (shermanii). J. Bacteriol. 177, 1564–1569.http://jb.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/177/6/1564&lt;/ref&gt;  So as with GFP, no addition of exogenous substrates is required.  UMT has been used as a bioreporter for the selection of recombinant [[plasmids]], as a marker for gene [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] in bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells, and for the detection of toxic salts such as [[arsenite]] and [[antimonite]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10679">{{short description|Measure of the amount of oxygen that can be consumed by reactions in a solution}}
In [[environmental chemistry]], the '''chemical oxygen demand''' ('''COD''') is an indicative measure of the amount of [[oxygen]] that can be consumed by [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] in a measured [[solution]]. It is commonly expressed in [[mass]] of oxygen consumed over [[volume]] of solution which in SI units is milligrams per litre ([[milligram|mg]]/[[Litre|L]]). A COD test can be used to easily quantify the amount of [[organic compound|organics]] in [[water]]. The most common application of COD is in quantifying the amount of oxidizable [[pollutant]]s found in [[surface water]] (e.g. [[lake]]s and [[river]]s) or [[wastewater]]. COD is useful in terms of [[water quality]] by providing a metric to determine the effect an [[effluent]] will have on the receiving body, much like [[Biochemical oxygen demand|biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)]].

==Overview ==
The basis for the COD test is that nearly all organic compounds can be fully oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]] with a strong [[oxidizing agent]] under [[acid]]ic conditions. The amount of [[oxygen]] required to oxidize an organic compound to carbon dioxide, [[ammonia]], and water is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{C}_n\mbox{H}_a\mbox{O}_b\mbox{N}_c + \left( n + \frac{a}{4} - \frac{b}{2} - \frac{3}{4}c \right)\mbox{O}_2 \rightarrow n\mbox{CO}_2 + \left( \frac{a}{2} - \frac{3}{2}c \right)\mbox{H}_2\mbox{O} + c\mbox{NH}_3&lt;/math&gt;
This expression does not include the oxygen demand caused by [[nitrification]], the oxidation of ammonia into [[nitrate]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{N}\mbox{H}_3 + 2\mbox{O}_2 \rightarrow \mbox{N}\mbox{O}_3^- + \mbox{H}_3\mbox{O}^+&lt;/math&gt;
[[Chromate and dichromate|Dichromate]], the oxidizing agent for COD determination, does not oxidize ammonia into nitrate, so nitrification is not included in the standard COD test.

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] describes a standard method for measuring chemical oxygen demand in ISO 6060 [http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=12260&amp;ICS1=13&amp;ICS2=60&amp;ICS3=50].

== Using potassium dichromate==
[[Potassium dichromate]] is a strong oxidizing agent under acidic conditions. Acidity is usually achieved by the addition of [[sulfuric acid]]. The reaction of potassium dichromate with organic compounds is given by:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{C}_n\ce{H}_a\ce{O}_b\ce{N}_c\ +\ d\ce{Cr2O7^2-}\ +\ (8d\ +\ c)\ce{H+ -&gt; }n\ce{CO2}\ +\ \frac {a + 8d - 3c}{2}\ce{H2O}\ +\ c\ce{NH4+}\ + 2d\ce{Cr^3+}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;d = 2n/3 + a/6 - b/3 - c/2&lt;/math&gt;. Most commonly, a 0.25 [[normality (chemistry)|N]] solution of potassium dichromate is used for COD determination, although for samples with COD below 50&amp;nbsp;mg/L, a lower concentration of potassium dichromate is preferred.

In the process of oxidizing the organic substances found in the water sample, potassium dichromate is reduced (since in all [[redox]] reactions, one reagent is oxidized and the other is reduced), forming Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. The amount of Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is determined after oxidization is complete, and is used as an indirect measure of the organic contents of the water sample.

===Measurement of excess===
For all organic matter to be completely oxidized, an excess amount of potassium dichromate (or any oxidizing agent) must be present. Once oxidation is complete, the amount of excess potassium dichromate must be measured to ensure that the amount of Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; can be determined with accuracy. To do so, the excess potassium dichromate is [[titration|titrated]] with [[ferrous ammonium sulfate]] (FAS) until all of the excess oxidizing agent has been reduced to Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Typically, the oxidation-reduction indicator [[ferroin]] is added during this titration step as well. Once all the excess dichromate has been reduced, the ferroin indicator changes from blue-green to a reddish brown. The amount of [[ferrous ammonium sulfate]] added is equivalent to the amount of excess potassium dichromate added to the original sample. Note: Ferroin indicator is bright red from commercially prepared sources, but when added to a digested sample containing potassium dichromate it exhibits a green hue. During the titration the color of the indicator changes from a green hue to a bright blue hue to a reddish brown upon reaching the endpoint. Ferroin indicator changes from red to pale blue when oxidized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/f.shtml|title=General Chemistry Online: Glossary:|author=|date=|website=antoine.frostburg.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation of ferroin indicator reagent==
A solution of 1.485 g 1,10-[[phenanthroline]] monohydrate is added to a solution of 695&amp;nbsp;mg FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in distilled water, and the resulting red solution is diluted to 100 mL.

===Calculations===
The following formula is used to calculate COD:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{COD} = \frac{8000 (b - s)n}\text{sample volume}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b'' is the volume of FAS used in the blank sample, ''s'' is the volume of FAS in the original sample, and ''n'' is the normality of FAS. If milliliters are used consistently for volume measurements, the result of the COD calculation is given in mg/L.

The COD can also be estimated from the concentration of oxidizable compound in the sample, based on its stoichiometric reaction with oxygen to yield CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (assume all C goes to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (assume all H goes to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (assume all N goes to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), using the following formula:

:COD = (''C''/FW)&amp;middot;(RMO)&amp;middot;32

Where 
:''C'' = Concentration of oxidizable compound in the sample,
:FW = Formula weight of the oxidizable compound in the sample,
:RMO = Ratio of the # of moles of oxygen to # of moles of oxidizable compound in their reaction to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, water, and ammonia

For example, if a sample has 500 Wppm (Weight Parts per Million) of phenol:

:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH + 7O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 6CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

:COD = (500/94)&amp;middot;7&amp;middot;32 = 1191 Wppm

==Inorganic interference==
Some samples of water contain high levels of oxidizable inorganic materials which may interfere with the determination of COD. Because of its high concentration in most [[wastewater]], [[chloride]] is often the most serious source of interference. Its reaction with potassium dichromate follows the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{6Cl^- + Cr_2O_7^{2-} + 14H^+ \rightarrow 3Cl_2 + 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O}&lt;/math&gt;

Prior to the addition of other reagents, [[mercuric sulfate]] can be added to the sample to eliminate chloride interference.

The following table lists a number of other inorganic substances that may cause interference. The table also lists chemicals that may be used to eliminate such interference, and the compounds formed when the inorganic molecule is eliminated.

==Government regulation==
Many governments impose strict regulations regarding the maximum chemical oxygen demand allowed in waste water before they can be returned to the environment. For example, in [[Switzerland]], a maximum oxygen demand between 200 and 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/L must be reached before waste water or [[industrial water]] can be returned to the environment [https://web.archive.org/web/20040310122559/http://www.csem.ch/corporate/Report2002/pdf/p56.pdf].

==History==
For many years, the strong [[oxidizing agent]] [[potassium permanganate]] ([[potassium|K]][[manganese|Mn]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) was used for measuring chemical oxygen demand. Measurements were called ''oxygen consumed'' from permanganate, rather than the ''oxygen demand'' of organic substances. Potassium permanganate's effectiveness at oxidizing organic compounds varied widely, and in many cases [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) measurements were often much greater than results from COD measurements. This indicated that potassium permanganate was not able to effectively oxidize all organic compounds in water, rendering it a relatively poor oxidizing agent for determining COD.

Since then, other oxidizing agents such as [[ceric sulphate]], [[potassium iodate]], and [[potassium dichromate]] have been used to determine COD. Of these, potassium dichromate ([[Potassium_dichromate|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]]) has been shown to be the most effective: it is relatively cheap, easy to [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purify]], and is able to nearly completely oxidize almost all organic compounds.

In these methods, a fixed volume with a known excess amount of the oxidant is added to a sample of the solution being analyzed. After a refluxing digestion step, the initial concentration of organic substances in the sample is calculated from a titrimetric or spectrophotometric determination of the oxidant still remaining in the sample. As with all colorimetric methods [[blank (solution)|blanks]] are used to control for contamination by outside material.

In the context of [[wireless networking]], '''Constant Awake Mode''' ('''CAM''') is a mode that is intended for devices when power is not an issue, such as when [[AC power]] is available to a device.&lt;ref&gt;https://laird-ews-support.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/1430695-power-save-modes-cam-fast-max-?b_id=1982&lt;/ref&gt; This mode provides the best connectivity  from the user perspective. CAM is also appropriate when a portable device will be used for only a short time that the [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] can easily accommodate. This is the most commonly used mode, and can be contrasted with power saving modes, which may or may not be offered by a particular device.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1694">A '''design competition''' is a [[competition]] in which an entity solicits design proposals from the public for a specified purpose.

==Architecture==
An [[architectural design competition]] solicits architects to submit design proposals for a building, bridge, or other structure. Such competitions may be ''open'', receiving bids internationally, domestically, or regionally. The competition may occur in a single stage, or involve two stages, the first of which eliminates non-viable candidates.

Famous early examples of design competitions were for the [[Acropolis of Athens]] in 448 BCE, and the dome of the [[Florence Cathedral]] in 1418.

==Coins and stamps==
Coin and stamp design contests solicit designs to appear on the face of stamps and usually the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of coins. In 1998, the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] held the Millennium Coin Design Contest, a competition for the design of 24 [[Quarter (Canadian coin)|quarters]], one for each month of 1999 and 2000.&lt;!-- was this a project of the Millennium Bureau of Canada ? --&gt;

==Monuments and sculptures==
The design of artistic objects and monuments is a common subject in design competitions. A well-known example is the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in [[Washington D.C.]] designed by [[Maya Lin]].

==Urban space==
Urban and landscape projects may solicit design proposals in a competition. Among them are projects for urban parks, streetscapes, and rehabilitation of natural areas.

==Student design competition==
A [[student design competition]] is a [[student competition]] to introduce students to real-world engineering practices and design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">The '''DigRF''' working group was formed as a [[Mobile Industry Processor Interface|MIPI Alliance]] (MIPI) [[working group]] in April 2007. The group is focused on developing specifications for wireless mobile [[RFIC]] to base-band IC ([[BBIC]]) interfaces in mobile devices.

The group's current charter is split into short-term and long-term development efforts. The short-term development will focus on a specification targeted for completion by end of 2007 for [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]] and [[WiMax]] [[air interface]] standards. The longer term development will focus on future air interface standards which promise further improvements in high speed, data optimized traffic. In addition, the future work will seek to harmonize efforts with the MIPI's [[PHY]] and [[UniPro]] working groups.

These specifications will describe the logical, electrical and timing characteristics of the digital RF-BB Interface with sufficient detail to allow physical implementation of the interface, and with sufficient rigor that implementations of the interface from different suppliers are fully compatible at the physical level.

There is DigRF version v1.12 for usage in GSM/EDGE handsets, which was specified in 2004. DigRF v3.09 from the year 2006 with its 312 Mbit/s can additionally handle [[UMTS]]. The present DigRF v4 draft offers Gbit/s bandwidth for LTE and WiMax.

'''End-user development''' ('''EUD''') or '''end-user programming''' ('''EUP''') refers to activities and tools that allow [[User (computing)|end-user]]s – people who are not professional software developers – to [[Computer programming|program computers]]. People who are not professional developers can use EUD tools to create or modify ''software artifacts'' (descriptions of automated behavior) and complex data objects without significant knowledge of a [[programming language]]. In 2005 it was estimated (using statistics from the U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]) that by 2012 there would be more than 55 million end-user developers in the United States, compared with fewer than 3 million professional programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scaffidi|first=C.|last2=Shaw|first2=M.|last3=Myers|first3=B.|date=2005-09-01|title=Estimating the numbers of end users and end user programmers|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1509505/|journal=2005 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC'05)|pages=207–214|doi=10.1109/VLHCC.2005.34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various EUD approaches exist, and it is an active [[Discipline (academia)|research topic]] within the field of [[computer science]] and [[human-computer interaction]]. Examples include [[natural language programming]],&lt;ref&gt;Little, Greg, and Robert C. Miller.

The most popular EUD tool is the [[spreadsheet]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/end-user_development.html|first1=Margaret M.|last1=Burnett|author1-link=Margaret Burnett|first2=Christopher|last2=Scaffidi|title=End-User Development|publisher=Interaction-Design.org}} at "Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Empowering Users"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/08/empowering-users-to-create-their-own-software.php|title=Empowering Users to Create Their Own Software|first=Peter |last=Hornsby |date=2009-08-03 |accessdate=2014-01-31 |website=UXmatters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their unrestricted nature, spreadsheets allow relatively un-sophisticated computer users to write programs that represent complex data models, while shielding them from the need to learn lower-level programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abraham |first=R. |last2=Burnett |first2=M |last3=Erwig |first3=M |year=2009 |chapter=Spreadsheet programming |title=Wiley Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Engineering |pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of their common use in business, spreadsheet skills are among the most beneficial skills for a graduate employee to have, and are therefore the most commonly sought after&lt;ref&gt;Kruck, S. &amp; Sheetz, S., 2001. [http://www.pucrs.br/ciencias/viali/tic_literatura/artigos/planilhas/KRUCK-SHEETZ_SpreadsheetAccTheory.pdf Spreadsheet accuracy theory]. Journal of Information Systems Education.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States of America alone, there are an estimated 13 million end-user developers programming with spreadsheets&lt;ref&gt;Scaffidi, C., Shaw, M. &amp; Myers, B., 2005. [http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~cscaffid/papers/eu_20050923_vlhcc.pdf Estimating the Numbers of End Users and End User Programmers]. 2005 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC’05), pp.207–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[programming by example]] (''PbE'') approach reduces the need for the user to learn the abstractions of a classic programming language. The user instead introduces some examples of the desired results or operations that should be performed on the data, and the PbE system infers some abstractions corresponding to a program that produces this output, which the user can refine. New data may then be introduced to the automatically created program, and the user can correct any mistakes made by the program in order to improve its definition. [[Low-code development platforms]] are also an approach to EUD.

One evolution in this area has considered the use of mobile devices to support end-user development activities. In this case previous approaches for desktop applications cannot be simply reproposed, given the specific characteristics of mobile devices. Desktop EUD environments lack the advantages of enabling end users to create applications opportunistically while on the move.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/532659/ Paternò F., 2013, ISRN Software Engineering, End User Development: Survey of an Emerging Field for Empowering People]&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recently, interest in how to exploit EUD to support development of Internet of Things applications has increased. In this area trigger-action programming seems a promising approach.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3057861&amp;ftid=1868975&amp;dwn=1&amp;CFID=15395619&amp;CFTOKEN=88b71644acac92dd-68065E67-C078-832A-D6A5CF54EBDFA5C9/ Ghiani, G., Manca, M., Paternò, F., Santoro, C.: Personalization of Context-dependent Applications through Trigger-Action Rules. ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol.24, Issue 2, Article N.14, April 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lessons learned from EUD solutions can significantly influence the [[Software release life cycle|software life cycles]] for [[Software product management|commercial software products]], in-house [[intranet]]/[[extranet]] developments and [[Enterprise resource planning|enterprise application]] deployments.

==Application specific low code development platforms==
Roughly 40 vendors now offer solutions targeted at end users designed to reduce programming efforts. These solutions do not require traditional programming and may be based around relatively narrow functionality, e.g. contract management, customer relationships management, issue and bug tracking. Often referred to as low code development platforms, web based interactions guide a user to develop an application in as little as 40-80 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[[Low-code development platforms]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;End-User Development can be defined as a set of methods, techniques, and tools that allow users of software systems, who are acting as non-professional software developers, at some point to create, modify or extend a software artifact.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ko et al. propose the following definition:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ko|first=Andrew J.|last2=Abraham|first2=Robin|last3=Beckwith|first3=Laura|last4=Blackwell|first4=Alan|last5=Burnett|first5=Margaret|last6=Erwig|first6=Martin|last7=Scaffidi|first7=Chris|last8=Lawrance|first8=Joseph|last9=Lieberman|first9=Henry|date=2011-04-01|title=The State of the Art in End-user Software Engineering|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1922649.1922658|journal=ACM Comput.

&lt;blockquote&gt;End-user programming is programming to achieve the result of a program primarily for personal, rather [than] public use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EUD essentially outsources development effort to the end user. Because there is always some effort to learn an EUD tool, the users' motivation depends on their confidence that it will empower their work, save time on the job or raise productivity. In this model, the benefits to users are initially based on marketing, demonstrations and word-of-mouth. Once the technology is put into use, experience of actual benefits becomes the key motivator.

This study defines costs as the sum of:

* Technical cost: the price of the technology and the effort to install it
* Learning cost: the time taken to understand the technology
* Development cost: the effort to develop applications using the technology
* Test and debugging cost: the time taken to verify the system

The first and second costs are incurred once during acquisition, whereas the third and fourth are incurred every time an application is developed. Benefits (which may be perceived or actual) are seen as:

* Functionality delivered by the technology
* Flexibility to respond to new requirements
* Usability of applications produced
* Overall quality of the applications produced

== Collaborations in end-user development ==
Many end-user development activities are collaborative in nature, including collaboration between professional developers and end-user developers and collaboration among end-user developers.

Mutual development&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andersen|first=Renate|last2=Mørch|first2=Anders I.|date=2009-03-02|title=Mutual Development: A Case Study in Customer-Initiated Software Product Development|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-00427-8_3|journal=End-User Development|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=31–49|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-00427-8_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique where professional developers and end-user developers work together in creating software solutions. In mutual development, the professional developers often “under design” the system and provide the tools to allow the “owners of problems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-03035-6_23|title=User-Centred Requirements for Software Engineering Environments|last=Fischer|first=Gerhard|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=297–306|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03035-6_23}}&lt;/ref&gt;" to create the suitable solution at use time for their needs, objectives and situational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-5386-X_19|title=End User Development|last=Fischer|first=Gerhard|last2=Giaccardi|first2=Elisa|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9781402042201|editor-last=Lieberman|editor-first=Henry|series=Human-Computer Interaction Series|pages=427–457|language=en|doi=10.1007/1-4020-5386-x_19|editor-last2=Paternò|editor-first2=Fabio|editor-last3=Wulf|editor-first3=Volker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the communication between professional developers and end-user developers can often stimulate formalizing ad hoc modifications by the end users into software artifacts, transforming end-user developed solutions into commercial product features with impacts beyond local solutions.

In this collaboration, various approaches such as the Software Shaping Workshop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-5386-X_1|title=End User Development|last=Lieberman|first=Henry|last2=Paternò|first2=Fabio|last3=Klann|first3=Markus|last4=Wulf|first4=Volker|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9781402042201|editor-last=Lieberman|editor-first=Henry|series=Human-Computer Interaction Series|pages=1–8|language=en|doi=10.1007/1-4020-5386-x_1|editor-last2=Paternò|editor-first2=Fabio|editor-last3=Wulf|editor-first3=Volker}}&lt;/ref&gt; are proposed to bridge the communication gap between professional developers and end-user developers. These approaches often provide translucency according to the social translucence model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Thomas|last2=Kellogg|first2=Wendy A.|date=2000-03-01|title=Social Translucence: An Approach to Designing Systems That Support Social Processes|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/344949.345004|journal=ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum. Interact.|volume=7|issue=1|pages=59–83|doi=10.1145/344949.345004|issn=1073-0516}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling everyone in the collaboration to be aware of changes made by others and to be held accountable of their actions because of the awareness.

Besides programming collaboration platforms like GitHub, which are mostly utilized by expert developers due to their steep learning curve, collaborations among end-user developers often take place on wiki platforms where the software artifacts created are shared. End-user development is also often used for creating automation scripts or interactive tutorials for sharing “how-to” knowledge. Examples of such application include CoScripter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leshed|first=Gilly|last2=Haber|first2=Eben M.|last3=Matthews|first3=Tara|last4=Lau|first4=Tessa|date=2008-01-01|title=CoScripter: Automating &amp; Sharing How-to Knowledge in the Enterprise|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1357054.1357323|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '08|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1719–1728|doi=10.1145/1357054.1357323|isbn=9781605580111}}&lt;/ref&gt; and HILC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Intharah|first=Thanapong|last2=Turmukhambetov|first2=Daniyar|last3=Brostow|first3=Gabriel J.|date=2017-01-01|title=Help, It Looks Confusing: GUI Task Automation Through Demonstration and Follow-up Questions|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3025171.3025176|journal=Proceedings of the 22Nd International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces|series=IUI '17|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=233–243|doi=10.1145/3025171.3025176|isbn=9781450343480}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such applications, user can create scripts for tasks using pseudo-natural language or via programming by demonstration. The users can choose to upload the script to a wiki style repository of scripts. On this wiki, users can browse available scripts and extend existing scripts to support additional parameters, to handle additional conditions or to operate on additional objects.

Online and offline communities of end-user developers have also been formed, where end-user developers can collaboratively solve EUD problems of shared interest or for mutual benefit. In such communities, local experts spread expertise and advice. Community members also provide social support for each other to support the collaborative construction of software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=G.|last2=Giaccardi|first2=E.|last3=Ye|first3=Y.|last4=Sutcliffe|first4=A. G.|last5=Mehandjiev|first5=N.|date=2004-09-01|title=Meta-design: A Manifesto for End-user Development|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1015864.1015884|journal=Commun. ACM|volume=47|issue=9|pages=33–37|doi=10.1145/1015864.1015884|issn=0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Commentators have been concerned that end users do not understand how to test and secure their applications. Warren Harrison, a professor of computer science at Portland State University, wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=01309636 |title= The Dangers of End-User Programming |last=Harrison |first=Warren |journal=IEEE Software | volume=21 | issue=4 | date=July–August 2004 | format=PDF | doi=10.1109/MS.2004.13 | accessdate=2009-03-02|page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s simply unfathomable that we could expect security... from the vast majority of software applications out there when they’re written with little, if any, knowledge of generally accepted good practices such as specifying before coding, systematic testing, and so on.... How many X for Complete Idiots (where "X" is your favorite programming language) books are out there? I was initially amused by this trend, but recently I’ve become uneasy thinking about where these dabblers are applying their newfound knowledge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This viewpoint assumes that all end users are equally naive when it comes to understanding software, although Pliskin and Shoval argue this is not the case, that sophisticated end users are capable of end-user development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1017817 |first=Nava |last=Pliskin |author2=Shoval, Peretz |title=End-user prototyping: sophisticated users supporting system development |journal=ACM SIGMIS Database |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=7–17|year=1987|doi=10.1145/1017816.1017817|accessdate=2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, compared with expert programmers, end-user programmers rarely have the time or interest in systematic and disciplined software engineering activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Joel|last2=Guo|first2=Philip J.|last3=Lewenstein|first3=Joel|last4=Klemmer|first4=Scott R.|date=2008-01-01|title=Opportunistic Programming: How Rapid Ideation and Prototyping Occur in Practice|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1370847.1370848|journal=Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on End-user Software Engineering|series=WEUSE '08|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1–5|doi=10.1145/1370847.1370848|isbn=9781605580340}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes ensuring the quality of the software artifact produced by end-user development particularly challenging.

In response to this, the study of '''end-user software engineering''' has emerged. It is concerned with issues beyond end-user development, whereby end users become motivated to consider issues such as reusability, security and verifiability when developing their solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eusesconsortium.org/findings.php |title=End-User Software Engineering: Empirical Findings| publisher=End Users Shaping Effective Software Consortium | accessdate=2008-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative scenario is that end users or their consultants employ [[Declarative programming|declarative]] tools that support rigorous business and security rules at the expense of performance and scalability; tools created using EUD will typically have worse efficiency than those created with professional programming environments. Though separating functionality from efficiency is a valid [[separation of concerns]], it can lead to a situation where end users will complete and document the [[requirements analysis]] and [[Software prototyping|prototyping]] of the tool, without the involvement of [[Business analysis|business analysts]]. Thus, users will define the functions required before these experts have a chance to consider the limitations of a specific [[Application software|application]] or [[software framework]]. Senior management support for such end-user initiatives depends on their attitude to existing or potential [[vendor lock-in]].

A '''field-sequential color system''' (FSC) is a [[color television]] system in which the primary color information is transmitted in successive images and which relies on the human vision system to fuse the successive images into a color picture. One field-sequential system was developed by [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Dr. Peter Goldmark]] for [[CBS]], which was its sole user in commercial broadcasting. It was first demonstrated to the press on September 4, 1940,&lt;ref&gt;"Color Television Achieves Realism", ''New York Times'', September 5, 1940, p. 18. A color 16mm film was shown; live pick-ups were first demonstrated to the press in 1941. "Columbia Broadcasting Exhibits Color Television", ''Wall Street Journal'', January 10, 1941, p. 4. "[http://www.earlytelevision.org/cbs_1941_color_article.html CBS Makes Live Pick-up in Color Television] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014180015/http://www.earlytelevision.org/cbs_1941_color_article.html |date=October 14, 2007 }}", ''Radio &amp; Television'', April 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; and first shown to the general public on January 12, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;"Washington Chosen for First Color Showing; From Ages 4 to 90, Audience Amazed", ''The Washington Post'', January 13, 1950, p. B2.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Communications Commission]] adopted it on October 11, 1950 as the standard for [[color television]] in the [[United States]], but it was later withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;"C.B.S. Color Video Starts Nov. 20; Adapters Needed by Present Sets", ''New York Times'', October 12, 1950, p. 1. {{cite book |title=Radio and Television Regulation: Broadcast Technology in the United States 1920–1960 |author= Hugh Richard Slotten |publisher=JHU Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-8018-6450-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cZLQ9R5GKfsC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22Field+sequential+color+system%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of sequential color systems for moving images predates the invention of fully electronic television. Although usually known at the time simply as "[[Additive color|additive]]" rather than sequential color systems, two-color [[Kinemacolor]], in commercial use since 1906, and its predecessor three-color format, invented by [[Edward Raymond Turner]] and patented in 1899, were both sequential natural color  systems for use with motion picture film. They utilized black-and-white film and rotating color filter wheels to record the amount of each color in the scene on alternating [[Film frame|frames]] of the film, so that when the frames were projected by light of similar colors at a sufficiently rapid rate, those colors blended together in the viewer's eye and produced a wider range of hues. Due to litigation by [[William Friese-Greene]], Kinemacolor ended up in the public domain in 1915, after which several derivative sequential color processes (such as Friese-Greene's ''Biocolour'' and the original [[Prizma|Prisma Color]]) were developed. Some were brought to the point of being publicly shown, but during the 1920s they could not compete with rival [[bipack]] and other [[subtractive color]] processes, which were free of color flicker and did not require special projection equipment—the final multicolored images were right there on the film as transparent coloring matter.

==Operation==
[[File:Goldmark1940color.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Patent diagrams of CBS field-sequential color system: Fig. 1 the transmission system, Fig. 2 the receiving system, Fig. 3 the color filter disk.]]
The CBS field-sequential system was an example of a [[mechanical television]] system because it relied in part on a disc of color filters rotating at 1440 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]] inside the camera and the receiver, capturing and displaying red, green, and blue television images in sequence. The [[field (video)|field]] rate was increased from 60 to 144 fields per second to overcome the flicker from the separate color images, resulting in 24 complete color frames per second (each of the three colors was scanned twice, double [[Interlaced video|interlacing]] being standard for all electronic television: 2 scans × 3 colors × 24 frames per second = 144 fields per second), instead of the standard 30 frames/60 fields per second of monochrome. If the 144-field color signal were transmitted with the same detail as a 60-field monochrome signal, 2.4 times the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] would be required. Therefore, to keep the signal within the standard 6-MHz bandwidth of a channel, the image's vertical [[image resolution|resolution]] was reduced from 525 lines to 405. The vertical resolution was 77% of monochrome, and the horizontal resolution was 54% of monochrome.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Schreiber, "Introduction to 'Color Television—Part I'", ''Proceedings of the IEEE'', vol. 87, no. 1, January 1999, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these variances in resolution and frame rate from the [[NTSC]] standards for television broadcasting, field-sequential color broadcasts could not be seen on existing black and white receivers without an adapter (to see them in monochrome), or adapter-converter (to see them in color).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/cbs_color_ads.html#admiral CBS Field Sequential System: Advertisements], Early Television Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial failure==
CBS purchased its own television manufacturer in April 1951 when no other company would produce color sets using the system.&lt;ref&gt;"Hytron's Deal With CBS Seen TV Color Aid", ''The Washington Post'', April 12, 1951, p. 15. In June 1951, [[Philco]] offered 11 television models that could show CBS color broadcasts in black and white. "Philco Offers 11 TV Sets To Receive CBS Color TV in Black and White", ''Wall Street Journal'', June 4, 1951, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Production of CBS-Columbia color receivers began in September;&lt;ref&gt;"CBS Subsidiary Starts Mass Production of Color Television Sets", ''Wall Street Journal'', September 13, 1951, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; they were first offered for retail sale in October.

Field-sequential color broadcasts were suspended by CBS on October 21, 1951, ostensibly by request of the [[National Production Authority]], which in November 1951 prohibited the manufacture of color sets for the general public during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;"Color TV Shelved As a Defense Step," ''New York Times'', October 20, 1951, p. 1. "Action of Defense Mobilizer in Postponing Color TV Poses Many Question for the Industry," ''New York Times'', October 22, 1951, p. 23. Ed Reitan, [http://colortelevision.info/Color_Sys_CBS.html CBS Field Sequential Color System], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 200 color sets had been manufactured for commercial sale, and only 100 of those had shipped, when CBS suspended its color broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://colortelevision.info/Color_Sys_CBS.html CBS Field Sequential Color System], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; CBS announced in March 1953 that it had abandoned any further plans for its color system.&lt;ref&gt;"CBS Says Confusion Now Bars Color TV," ''Washington Post'', March 26, 1953, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; RCA was the leading company in the television field, with a larger technical staff, more development funds, and more political success in getting the NTSC compatible [[color television]] system. RCA developed the hardware for NTSC  which superseded the field-sequential system as the U.S. standard in December 1953.

==Predecessor inventions==
According to television historian Albert Abramson, A. A. Polumordvinov invented the first field-sequential color system. Polumordvinov applied for his Russian patent 10738 in 1899. This system scanned images with two rotating cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, The History of Television, 1880 to 1941 (Jefferson, North Carolina: 1987), pp. 22, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; A later German patent by A. Frankenstein and Werner von Jaworski described another field-sequential system. Like the CBS System, this patent included a color wheel. Frankenstein and Jaworski applied for their patent 172376 in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, The History of Television, 1880 to 1941 (Jefferson, North Carolina: 1987), pp. 24, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; This patent probably inspired John Logie Baird to use a similar color wheel in his system.

[[John Logie Baird]] demonstrated a version of field-sequential color television on July 3, 1928, using a mechanical television system before his use of [[cathode ray tube]]s, and producing a vertical color image about 4 inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm) high. It was described in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'':
:The process consisted of first exploring the object, the image of which is to be transmitted, with a spot of red light, next with a spot of green light, and finally with a spot of blue light. At the receiving station a similar process is employed, red, blue and green images being presented in rapid success to the eye. The apparatus used at the transmitter consists of a disc perforated with three successive spiral curves of holes. The holes in the first spiral are covered with red filters, in the second with green filters and in the third with blue. Light is projected through these holes and an image of the moving holes is projected onto the object. The disc revolves at 10 revolutions per second and so thirty complete images are transmitted every second — ten blue, ten red, and ten green.

:At the receiving station a similar disc revolves synchronously with the transmitting disc, and behind this disc, in line with the eye of the observer, are two glow discharge lamps. One of these lamps is a neon tube and the other a tube containing mercury vapour and helium. By means of a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] the mercury vapour and helium tube is placed in circuit for two-thirds of a revolution and the neon tube for the remaining third. The red light from the neon is accentuated by placing red filters over the view holes for the red image. Similarly, the view holes corresponding to the green and blue images are covered by suitable filters. The blue and green lights both come from the mercury helium tube, which emits rays rich in both colours.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Alexander Russell, ''Nature'', August 18, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baird demonstrated a modified two-color version in February 1938, using a red and blue-green filter arrangement in the transmitter; on July 27, 1939 he further demonstrated that color scanning system in combination with a cathode ray tube with filter wheel as the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.earlytelevision.org/baird_mechanical_color.html Colour Television: Baird Experimental System Described]", ''Wireless World'', August 17, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later use==
For the first nine months of NTSC color in 1953–1954, CBS continued to use its field-sequential color television cameras, with the field rate and signal adapted for NTSC standards, until RCA delivered its first production model of an NTSC color camera in time for the 1954–55 season.

The [[Soviet Union]] was the only other country to experiment with a field-sequential color system. It manufactured a small number of color receivers in 1954 that used a mechanical color disc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/raduga.html 1954 Russian Raduga (Rainbow) Field Sequential Color Set], Early Television Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field-sequential system was used in specialized applications long after it had been replaced for broadcast television. A notable user of the technology was NASA. Field-sequential color cameras were used on the [[Apollo TV camera|Apollo lunar landing cameras]] which transmitted color television images from the Moon during [[Human spaceflight|missions]] from 1969 to 1972. Another system was used for the [[Voyager program]] in 1979, to take pictures and video of Jupiter. Early [[Space Shuttle]] flights (from 1981 to 1995) used cameras with interchangeable lenses. For color transmissions, a field-sequential color system was built into the lens assembly.  For the NASA transmissions, the video from space was field sequential, converted by a duty cycle extension technique to component RGB color video on the ground, and thereafter converted to NTSC and other world standards like PAL and SECAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poynton.com/notes/bio/Poynton_B_2.html |title=Charles Poynton – Biography |accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/stsref-toc.html#sts-cctv |title=NSTS 1988 News Reference Manual |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern day [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) projectors commonly use color wheels to generate color images, typically running at a multiple of the video frame rate.

Modern day LCD displays implement FSC by using several colors of LED backlight, by cycling the backlights, and gain several advantages such as brighter colors, darker blacks, and lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mbtmag.com/article/2012/02/advantages-field-sequential-color-technology|title=The Advantages to Field Sequential Color Technology |accessdate=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These displays are used in [[LCD]] Camera viewfinders and other industrial applications.

[[Recycling]] operations may range from simple, manually-fed, self-contained machines to extravagant crushing systems complete with [[sieve|screens]], [[conveyors]], [[crushers]] and separators. All non-glass contaminants must generally be removed from the glass prior to recycling. The processes used in glass crushing for [[recycling]] involves the same methods used by the [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] industry for crushing rock into sand ([[rock crusher]]).

==Vertical shaft impactor (VSI) glass crushing==

The use of VSI crushers in large scale operations allow the production of up to 125 tons per hour &lt;ref&gt;({{Citation
 |title=CEMCO Turbo&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; 54 Model Crusher

}}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; of crushed glass [[cullet]].
 
VSI [[crushers]] use a  high speed [[Turbine|rotor]] with wear-resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the glass against. The VSI crushers utilize [[velocity]] rather than surface force as the predominant force to break glass as this allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both across the surface of the material as well as through the mass of the material. In its shattered state, glass has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force ([[pressure]]) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubicle [[wiktionary:Particles|particles]]. As glass is 'thrown' by a VSI rotor against a solid [[anvil]], it fractures and breaks along [[fissures]]. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the glass is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI crushing is generally of a consistent cubicle shape which may optimize yield in consumptive applications such as the fabrication of [[fiberglass]], ceramic ware, flux agents and [[abrasives]]. Due to the highly abrasive nature of the glass material, a VSI crushing process is generally preferred over Horizontal Shaft Impact and most other crushing methods with higher maintenance and lower wear part lives.

VSI crushers generally utilize a high speed spinning rotor at the center of the crushing chamber and an outer impact surface of either abrasive resistant metal anvils or crushed glass (or rock in an aggregate applications). Utilizing cast metal surfaces '[[anvils]]' are traditionally referred to as a "Shoe and Anvil VSI". Utilizing crushed material on the outer walls of the crusher for new material to be crushed against is traditionally referred to as "rock on rock VSI".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3746">The '''hot wire barretter''' was a [[demodulator|demodulating]] detector, invented in 1902 by [[Reginald Fessenden]], that found limited use in early [[radio receiver]]s. In effect it was a highly sensitive [[thermoresistor]] which could recover amplitude modulated signals, something that the [[coherer]] (the standard detector of the time) could not do.&lt;ref name=TKS06&gt;''History of Wireless''
Tapan K. Sarkar, Robert Mailloux, Arthur A. Oliner, Magdalena Salazar-Palma, Dipak L. Sengupta
{{ISBN|978-0-471-78301-5}} January 2006, Wiley-IEEE Press page 369&lt;/ref&gt;

The first device used to demodulate audio signals, it was later superseded by the [[electrolytic detector]], also generally attributed to Fessenden. The barretter principle is still used as a detector for [[microwave]] radiation, similar to a [[bolometer]].

==Description and construction==
Fessenden's 1902 patent describes the construction of the device. A fine [[platinum]] wire, about {{convert|0.003|in|mm|2}} in diameter, is embedded in the middle of a [[silver]] tube having a diameter of about {{convert|0.1|in|mm|1}}. This compound wire is then [[Wire drawing|drawn]] until the silver wire has a diameter of about {{convert|0.002|in|mm|2}}; as the platinum wire within it is reduced in the same ratio, it is drawn down to a final diameter of {{convert|0.00006|in|μm|1}}. The result is called [[Wollaston wire]].

The silver cladding is etched off a short piece of the composite wire, leaving an extremely fine platinum wire;  this is supported, on two heavier silver wires, in a loop inside a glass bulb. The leads are taken out through the glass envelope and the whole device is put under vacuum and then sealed.

== Operation ==
The hot wire barretter depends upon the increase of a metal's resistivity with increasing temperature.  The device is biased by a [[direct current]] adjusted to heat the wire to its most sensitive temperature.  When there is an oscillating current from the antenna through the extremely fine platinum wire loop, the wire is further heated as the current increases and cools as the current decreases again. As the wire heats and cools, it varies its resistance in response to the signals passing through it. Because of the low thermal mass of the wire, it is capable of responding quickly enough to vary its resistance in response to audio signals. However, it cannot vary its resistance fast enough to respond to the much higher radio frequencies. The radio frequencies are essentially removed, and the sound is demodulated because the current through the circuit varies with the changing wire resistance. Headphones are connected in series with the D.C. circuit and the variations in the current are rendered as sound.

'''Hugh Bradner''' (November 5, 1915 – May 5, 2008) was an [[United States|American]] [[physicist]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] who is credited with inventing the [[neoprene]] [[wetsuit]], which helped to revolutionize [[scuba diving]].

A graduate of Ohio's [[Miami University]], he received his doctorate from [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena, California]], in 1941. He worked at the [[US Naval Ordnance Laboratory]] during [[World War II]], where he researched [[naval mines]]. In 1943, he was recruited by [[Robert Oppenheimer]] to join the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]]. There, he worked with scientists including [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], [[John von Neumann]] and [[George Kistiakowsky]] on the development of the [[high explosives]] and [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s required by [[atomic bomb]]s.

After the war, Bradner took a position studying [[high-energy physics]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], under [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]]. Bradner investigated the problems encountered by [[frogmen]] staying in cold water for long periods of time. He developed a [[neoprene]] suit which could trap the water between the body and the neoprene, and thereby keep them warm. He became known as the "father of the wetsuit."&lt;ref name=sfc&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Taylor|title=Hugh Bradner, UC's inventor of wetsuit, dies |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/11/BANR10KEF8.DTL|work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |publisher= |date=May 11, 2008 |accessdate=May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradner worked on the 1951 [[Operation Greenhouse]] nuclear test series on [[Enewetak Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]]. He joined the Scripps Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics as a [[geophysicist]] in 1961. He remained there for the rest of his career, becoming a full professor in 1963, and retiring in 1980. In retirement, continued to work both on oceanographic research, as well as on the [[DUMAND]] deep ocean neutrino astronomy project.

==Manhattan Project==
[[File:Marjorie Bradner Los Alamos ID.png|thumb|right|Marjorie Bradner's identification badge photo from Los Alamos]]
After receiving his doctorate from Caltech, Bradner worked at the [[US Naval Ordnance Laboratory]] where he researched [[naval mines]] until 1943. He was recruited by [[Robert Oppenheimer]] to join the [[Manhattan Project]] in 1943 at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]], which helped to develop the first [[atomic bomb]]. Bradner helped to develop a wide range of technology needed for the bomb, including research on the [[high explosives]] and [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s needed to implode the atomic bomb, developed the bomb's triggering mechanism, and even helped design the new town around the [[laboratory]]. He worked closely with some of the most prominent scientists including [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], [[John von Neumann]] and [[George Kistiakowsky]]. He witnessed the [[Trinity test]], the first [[nuclear weapons test]], at [[Holloman Air Force Base|Alamogordo]] on July 16, 1945.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Bradner met his future wife, Marjorie Hall Bradner, who was also working as a secretary on the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos  Laboratory. The couple were married in Los Alamos in 1943. Security at the [[top secret]] facility was so tight that neither Bradner's nor Hall's parents were allowed to attend the ceremony, though Oppenheimer was among the [[wedding]] guests.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; The couple remained together for over 65 years until she died on April 10, 2008 at the age of 89.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt;

==Wetsuit==
After the war, Bradner took a position studying [[high-energy physics]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] under [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], whom he had worked with at the Manhattan Project. He remained at the University until 1961. He worked on the 1951 atomic bombing test on [[Enewetak Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]], which was part of the [[Operation Greenhouse]] nuclear test series.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Bradner's job at Berkeley required him to do a number of underwater dives. He had previously talked to [[United States Navy]] [[frogmen]] during [[World War II]] concerning the problems of staying in cold water for long periods of time, which causes the diver to lose large amounts of body heat quickly. He worked on developing a new suit that would counter this in the basement of his family's home on Scenic Avenue in [[Berkeley, California]],&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; and researched the new [[wetsuit]] at a conference in [[Coronado, California]], in December 1951.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the wetsuit was invented in 1952.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; Bradner and other engineers founded the Engineering Development Company (EDCO) in order to develop it.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He and his colleagues tested several versions and [[prototypes]] of the wetsuit at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in [[La Jolla, California]].&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; Scripps scientist and [[engineer]] [[Willard Bascom]] advised Bradner to use [[neoprene]] for the suit material, which proved successful.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He found that it  "would trap the water between the body and the neoprene, and the water would heat up to body temperature and keep you warm".&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt;

A 1951 letter showed that Bradner clearly understood that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, and it did not need to be dry to work.&lt;ref name=Rainey&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scilib.ucsd.edu/sio/hist/rainey_wet_suit_pursuit.pdf |title=Wet Suit Pursuit: Hugh Bradner's Development of the First Wet Suit |accessdate=December 24, 2009 |last=Rainey |first=C |work=UC San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography Archives, Scripps Institution of Oceanography}}&lt;/ref&gt; He applied for a [[Patent|U.S. patent]] for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the [[flight suit]]. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater [[sonar]] and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Bradner and his company, EDCO, tried to sell his wetsuits in the [[consumer]] market. However, he failed to successfully penetrate the wetsuit market the way others have done - including [[Bob Meistrell]] and [[Bill Meistrell]], the founders of [[Body Glove]], and [[Jack O'Neill (businessman)|Jack O'Neill]]. Various claims have been made over the years that it was the O'Neill or the Meistrell brothers who actually invented the wetsuit instead of Bradner, but recent researchers have concluded that it was Bradner who created the original wetsuit, and not his competitors. In 2005 the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' concluded that Bradner was the "father of the wetsuit",&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt; and a research paper published by Carolyn Rainey at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1998 provided corroborating evidence.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt;

==Later career and life==
Bradner joined the Scripps Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics as a [[geophysicist]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;
He became a full professor in 1963 and retired in 1980.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; He remained interested in [[oceanography]], [[scuba diving]], seashell collecting and the outdoors throughout his later years,&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; and continued to work both on oceanographic research, as well as on the [[DUMAND]] deep ocean neutrino astronomy project, which combined his two careers in physics and oceanography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inp.demokritos.gr/nestor/2nd/files/001_019_resvanis.pdf |title=NESTOR - A Neutrino Particle Astrophysics Ubnderwater Laboratory for the Mediterranean |publisher=[[NESTOR Project]]  |accessdate=September 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/~dumand/roberts_92_rmp.pdf |publisher=University of Hawaii |title=The Birth of High-Energy Neutrino Astronomy: A Personal History of the DUMAND Project |accessdate=September 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Bradner died at the age of 92 at his home in [[San Diego, California]], on May 5, 2008, from complications of [[pneumonia]]. He was survived by his daughter, Bari Cornet, three grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt;

The '''hydrocollator''', first introduced in 1947 by the Chattanooga Pharmacal Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=HYDROCOLLATOR steam packs accepted|journal=JAMA|date=Feb 17, 1951|volume=145|series=7|pages=487|pmid=14794475|issue=7|doi=10.1001/jama.1951.02920250039010}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of a thermostatically controlled water bath for placing bentonite-filled cloth heating pads. When the pads are removed from the bath, they are placed in covers and placed on the patient. The device is primarily used by [[athletic trainer]]s and [[physical therapist]]s.

== Research ==
The evidence behind the use of the hydrocollator is primarily concerned with achieving rapid heating of the tissue due to the more efficient transfer of energy through water as compared to air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petrofsky|first=J|author2=Bains G |author3=Prowse M |author4=Gunda S |author5=Berk L |author6=Raju C |author7=Ethiraju G |author8=Vanarasa D |author9=Madani P  |title=Does skin moisture influence the blood flow response to local heat?

The '''International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations''' ('''IUF''') is a [[global union federation]] of [[trade union]]s with members in a variety of industries, many of which relate to food processing.

==History==
The federation was founded in 1920 with the merger of three international organisations, representing bakers, brewers, and meat industry employees.  Originally named the '''International Union of Food and Allied Workers' Associations''' (IUFAWA), it affiliates were all European until 1950, but it then rapidly expanded worldwide.  By 1978, the federation was known as the IUF, and it had 2.1 million members.&lt;ref name="docherty"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Docherty|first1=James C.|last2=van der Velden|first2=Sjaak|title=Historical Dictionary of Organized Labor|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0810879883|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, the IUF campaigned against [[Coca-Cola]], which it believed was exploiting plantation workers.  In 1994, it merged with the [[International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers]], and took its present name.  From 1997, it began signing [[collective bargaining]] agreements with various multinational companies.&lt;ref name="docherty" /&gt;

==Current operations==
In 2017, the IUF was composed of 430 member organisations in 130 countries, representing more than 12 million workers.

The organization represents workers employed in agriculture, the preparation and manufacture of food and beverages, hotels, restaurants and [[catering]] services and in tobacco processing.

The international headquarters of IUF is located in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Within the organization, there are autonomous regional organizations for Africa, Asia/Pacific, the Caribbean, Europe and Latin America.

A '''marine sandglass''' is a [[timepiece]] of simple design that is a relative of the common [[hourglass]], a marine (nautical) instrument known since the 14th century (although reasonably presumed to be of very ancient use and origin). They were employed to measure the time at sea or on a given [[navigation]]al course, in repeated measures of small time increments (e.g., 30 minutes). Used together with the [[chip log]], smaller marine sandglasses were also used to measure the boat speed through the water in knots.

Although vital to maritime navigation, marine sandglasses were not accurate measuring instruments for the passage of time; many design and environmental factors could affect the duration of sand's flow, and therefore its reported time. Their use continued through the early 19th century, when they were supplanted by reliable [[Marine chronometer|mechanical timepieces]], and by other advances in [[marine navigation]].

Marine sandglasses were very popular on board ships, as they were the most dependable measurement of time while at sea.  Unlike the [[Water clock|clepsydra]], the motion of the ship while sailing did not affect the hourglass.  The fact that the hourglass also used granular materials instead of liquids gave it more accurate measurements, as the clepsydra was prone to get condensation inside it during temperature changes.&lt;ref name="Balmer"&gt;Balmer, R. T. "The Operation of Sand Clocks and Their Medieval Development." Technology and Culture, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pp. 615-632 Balmer, R. T. "The Operation of Sand Clocks and Their Medieval Development." Technology and Culture, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pp. 615-632.&lt;/ref&gt;  In conjunction with a record of a ship's speed and direction, seamen used the hourglass to determine their position with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref name="Balmer" /&gt;

==Design and use==
Marine sandglasses originally consisted of two glass bottles one inverted above the other, connected by a small tube, with the ends wrapped and so joined together. Over time, the later progress in the art of [[glassblowing]] allowed them to be made in a single piece. The marine glass was filled with sand or a suitable material such as finely ground eggshell, lead or tin chips (used to avoid humidity). This flowing material was chosen with two main objectives: to avoid the humidity and to absorb motion, both required for shipboard use.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

Placed in the upper half, the sand would flow slowly and steadily towards the lower half by the action of gravity, taking a certain time to empty (that was calibrated during their design and manufacture). Once the upper portion of the glass was empty, the glass could be turned to measure another time period.&lt;ref name=MAY&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Marine Navigation|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=UO5yQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=a+history+of+marine+navigation&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CVZVVNOsIczbaN-RguAL&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA| pages=108–110|date=1973| publisher=Norton| isbn=978-0-393-03140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Peleus-Thetis-350.jpg|thumb|350px |Sarcophagus dated ca 350 AD, representing the wedding of Peleus and Thetis (observe the magnification with the hourglass held by Morpheus in his hands)]]
The origin of the hourglass is unclear, although unlike its predecessor the [[Water clock|clepsydra]], or [[water clock]], which may have been invented in ancient Egypt, the first referenced use:
*According to The American Institute of New York: The clepsammia or sand-glass was invented at Alexandria about 150 B. C.&lt;ref name="York1870"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Institute of the City of New York|title=Annual Report of the American Institute of the City of New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3C8LAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1042|date=1870|publisher=C. van Benthuysen.|pages=1042–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the ''Journal of the British Archaeological Association'': the so-called clepsammia were in use before the time of St Jerome (335 AD) &lt;ref name="Association1873"&gt;{{cite book|author=British Archaeological Association|title=The Journal of the British Archaeological Association|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJRYAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA130|date=1873|publisher=Brit.

*M.Llauradó, found during an investigation, the first representation of an hourglass in a sarcophagus dated c. 350 AD, representing the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, discovered in Rome in the 18th century, and studied by Wincklemann in the 19th century, who remarked the hourglass held by Morpheus in his hands.&lt;ref name="Museum1810"&gt;{{cite book|author=British Museum|title=A Description of the Collection of Ancient Terracottas in the British Museum ; with Engravings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4NV9XLg_yUC&amp;pg=PT88|date=1810|publisher=K.

Use of the marine sandglass has been recorded since the 14th century; The written records about it were mostly from logbooks of European ships.&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt; In the same period it appears in other records and lists of ships stores.

This "orloge de mer" or "heures de naviguer" was sent to him, as a present, when he still was a prince (being therefore prior to 1356 when he took the place of his imprisoned father), by his aunt [[Yolande of Aragon]], when asking him for a manuscript of [[John de Mandeville]], to be translated to the Aragonese tongue.&lt;ref name="Yolande"&gt;{{cite book|title=Johan I D'Arago|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kb3SJxHaTpUC&amp;pg=PA128|publisher=Institut d'Estudis Catalans|pages=128–|id=GGKEY:8CXSF5T5A0D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most interesting thing about the second reference, the one from King Charles, is that a common sand-glass is defined as "ung grant orloge de mer" or "a large sea clock", this together with the fact that the first explanation of its use at sea (found by M.Llauradó) appears in the [[Francesc Eiximenis]] work "[[lo dotzé del crestià]]"&lt;ref name="1409Rogers1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eiximenis, Francesc, ca. 1340-ca. 1409|author2=Donna Mary Rogers|title=A Partial Edition of Francesc Eiximenis' Dotzè Del Crestià (Chs. 1-97) &amp;#91;microform&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-b2jcQAACAAJ|year=1988|publisher=Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Toronto|isbn=978-0-315-43411-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that was given to him as a present by his aunt [[Yolande of Aragon]],&lt;ref name="Yolande" /&gt; suggests that, at this period, the importance of a sand-glass was more commonly related to its use at sea and its fabrication demand may have been originated from the navigational needs from the [[Crown of Aragon]] a maritime power of the moment in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Diccionari Català Valencià Balear, Alcover-Moll: Rellotge de sorra.

== Importance in navigation ==
[[File:Wooden hourglass 3.jpg|thumb|Sandglass in a three-legged stand]]
In long-distance navigation through the open ocean, the sandglass or "glass" used to measure the time was a tool as important as the compass (which indicated sailing direction, and so ship's course).&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Filled with the amount of sand suitable for measuring a lapse of half an hour, each time the sand emptied was also called a "glass"; eight glasses (four hours) defined a "watch".&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; The times determined by the sandglass, along with the record in the logbook of the speed measured with the "[[chip log]]", permitted the ship's navigator to plot his map position.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Multiplying the ship's speed by the time the course had been kept (measured with the glass), gave traveled distance,&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; a simple, overall method termed [[dead reckoning]].&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

The marine sandglass was critical for maritime navigation before the 19th century.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; At the beginning of that century it became possible to navigate by the lunar distances, thanks to the tables of [[haversine]]s of [[Josef de Mendoza y Ríos|Joseph de Mendoza y Ríos]].&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Prior to this, dead reckoning navigation based on sandglass-determined times was used, alongside determination of latitude using the [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] (see also [[backstaff]], [[astrolabe]], and [[Octant (instrument)|octant]]);&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; this was the only system available to mariners to navigate the globe.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; The parallel use of relative time measurements at sea, and time measurement by mechanical clocks on land continued from at least 1350 to 1805, i.e., for more than 450 years.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

Although vital to navigation, the marine glass was not an accurate instrument to measure the passage of time.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; The design of the glass affected its accuracy in time measurement; the uniformity in fineness of the sand, the inner diameter of the connecting tube, and design aspects allowing wear that would effect the flow of sand all could contribute.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; In addition, many shipboard factors could affect the duration of sand's flow and therefore influence the time measured, including the humidity inside the glass, the ability for it to be positioned in a perfectly vertical position, and the acceleration or deceleration of the ship's movements.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Finally, the use of short duration glasses to measure long periods of time introduced further error.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Marine glass use was supplanted by reliable [[Marine chronometer|mechanical timepieces]], and by other advances in [[marine navigation]].&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

==Watch sandglasses==
[[Image:Loch à plateau.jpg|right|thumb|300px| Ship log sandglass in the left of the ship's log.]]
Watch sandglasses were used on ships to measure watch times, typically in half-hour periods. The helmsman&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; or ship's page&lt;ref Name=Bergreen&gt;{{Cite book| title = Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe | last = Bergreen | first = Laurence | date = 2003 | publisher = William Morrow | ISBN = 0-06-621173-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the crewmen responsible for turning the watch sandglass, thus supplying the time to be registered on the ship's log; watch measurement began with the sun reaching its highest point—its [[zenith]]—at midday, which was likewise the essential time reference point for navigation.&lt;ref Name=Bergreen/&gt; At that point in time, the ship's bell was struck eight times; after the first glass had emptied (half an hour), the ship's bell was struck once, after another glass, twice, and so on until four hours after midday, when it was again struck eight times.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; At that point, a new watch began, and the sequence was repeated.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

Hence, in the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]], there are records that his crew logged the passage of time using a half-hour "ampolleta" (glass) that was turned every time it emptied to keep track of the "canonical" hours.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Likewise, during the voyage of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] to circumnavigate the globe, 18 hourglasses from Barcelona were in the ship's inventory, after the trip being authorized by emperor Charles V.&lt;ref name="Hakluyt"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pigafetta|title=The First Voyage Around the World, 1519-1522|url=http://www.histo.cat/1/Encomienda-Barna-19-4-1519.jpg|date=1874|publisher=Hakluyt Society Press|isbn=|pages=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ship-log sandglass==

From the 16th century a much smaller 30-second "glass" was used along with the [[chip log]], to measure the speed (in knots) of the vessel over the water. The procedure was as follows:&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=José María Martínez-Hidalgo|title=Enciclopedia general del mar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpLgAAAACAAJ|date=1992|publisher=Garriga|isbn=978-84-7079-090-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|

A sailor ran the [[chip log]] and another sailor the sandglass. The slide of the pulled over the stern and let run the first length of line till the quadrant was stabilized in the water. The sailor was leaving to run the line to pass freely leaving the slide by hand and touching the first [[knot (unit)|knot]] sang "mark!" At the moment of the inverted glass and time began to run while the line was counting the knots as they passed until the sandglass sang "mark!" a second blow when they had dropped all the sand, then he caught the firmly the line, measuring the fraction of knot elapsed to the last mark! and cried P.E.: "Five knots and four fathoms!..&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;}}

[[File:Flux distribution inside the fiber.jpg|thumb|Membrane cartridge]]

While polymeric membranes are economical and technologically useful, they are bounded by their performance, known as the Robeson limit (permeability must be sacrificed for selectivity and vice versa).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jang|first=Kwang-Suk|last2=Kim|first2=Hyung-Ju|last3=Johnson|first3=J.

Membrane materials have expanded into the realm of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], [[zeolite]]s, [[metal-organic framework]]s, and [[perovskite]]s due to their strong thermal and chemical resistance as well as high tunability (ability to be modified and functionalized), leading to increased permeability and selectivity. [[Membrane]]s can be used for separating gas mixtures where they act as a permeable barrier through which different compounds move across at different rates or not move at all. The membranes can be nanoporous, polymer, etc. and the gas molecules penetrate according to their size, [[diffusivity]], or solubility.

==Membrane Governing Methodology==

[[File:Mechanisms of transport in membranes.jpg|thumb|upright=3.4|right|(a) Bulk flow through pores; (b) Knudsen diffusion through pores; (c) molecular sieving; (d) solution diffusion through dense membranes.]]
There are 3 main [[diffusion]] mechanisms, the first (b), [[Knudsen diffusion]] holds at very low pressures where lighter molecules can move across a membrane faster than heavy ones, in a material with reasonably large pores.&lt;ref name="Smit"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Carbon Capture and Sequestration|author1=Berend Smit |author2=Jeffrey A. Reimer |author3=Curtis M. Oldenburg |author4=Ian C. Bourg |publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-78326-328-8|location=|pages=281–354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second (c), [[Molecular sieve|molecular sieving]], is the case where the pores of the membrane are too small to let one component pass, a process which is typically not practical in gas applications, as the molecules are too small to design relevant pores. In these cases the movement of molecules is best described by pressure-driven convective flow through capillaries, which is quantified by [[Darcy's law|Darcy’s Law]]. However, the more general model in gas applications is the solution-diffusion (d) where particles are first dissolved onto the membrane and then diffuse through it both at different rates. This model is employed when the pores in the polymer membrane appear and disappear faster relative to the movement of the particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Membrane Technology and Applications|last=Richard W. Baker|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=2004|isbn=0-470-85445-6|location=|pages=15–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical membrane system the incoming feed stream is separated into two components: permeant and retentate. Permeant is the gas that travels across the membrane and the retentate is what is left of the feed. On both sides of the membrane, a gradient of [[chemical potential]] is maintained by a pressure difference which is the driving force for the gas molecules to pass through. The ease of transport of each species is quantified by the [[Permeation|permeability]], P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. With the assumptions of ideal mixing on both sides of the membrane, [[ideal gas law]], constant diffusion coefficient and [[Henry's law|Henry’s Law]], the flux of a species can be related to the pressure difference by [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick’s Law]]:&lt;ref name="Smit" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J=\frac{D_i K_i(p_i'-p_i'')}{l}=\frac{P_i(p_i'-p_i'')}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

where, (J&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is the [[Mass flux|molar flux]] of species i across the membrane, (l) is membrane thickness, (P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is permeability of species i, (D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is diffusivity, (K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is the Henry coefficient, and (p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;) and (p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;"&lt;/sup&gt;) represent the partial pressures of the species i at the feed and permeant side respectively. The product of D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is often expressed as the permeability of the species i,  on the specific membrane being used.

:&lt;math&gt;P_i=D_i K_i &lt;/math&gt;

The flow of a second species, j, can be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;J=\frac{P_j(p_j'-p_j'')}{l}&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Membrane separation process.jpg|thumb|upright=2|A simplified design schematic of a membrane separation process]]

With the expression above, a membrane system for a binary mixture can be sufficiently defined. it can be seen that the total flow across the membrane is strongly dependent on the relation between the feed and permeate pressures. The ratio of feed pressure (p&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;) over permeate pressure (p&lt;sup&gt;"&lt;/sup&gt;) is defined as the membrane pressure ratio (θ).

:&lt;math&gt;\theta=\frac{P'}{P''} &lt;/math&gt;

It is clear from the above, that a flow of species i or j across the membrane can only occur when:

:&lt;math&gt; p_i'-p_i'' =p' n_i'-p'' n_i'' \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the membrane will experience flow across it when there exists a concentration gradient between feed and permeate. If the gradient is positive, the flow will go from the feed to the permeate and species i will be separated from the feed.

:&lt;math&gt;p'n_i'-p''n_i''&gt;0 \rightarrow \frac{n_i''}{n_i'} \leq \frac{p'}{p''}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the maximum separation of species i results from:

:&lt;math&gt; n_i'',max'' = \frac{p'}{p''}n_i'= \theta n_i'&lt;/math&gt;

Another important coefficient when choosing the optimum membrane for a separation process is the membrane selectivity α&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; defined as the ratio of permeability of species i with relation to the species j.

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha_{ij}= \frac{P_i}{P_j} &lt;/math&gt;

This coefficient is used to indicate the level to which the membrane is able to separates species i from j. It is obvious from the expression above, that a membrane selectivity of 1 indicates the membrane has no potential to separate the two gases, the reason being, both gases will diffuse equally through the membrane.

In the design of a separation process, normally the pressure ratio and the membrane selectivity are prescribed by the pressures of the system and the permeability of the membrane . The level of separation achieved by the membrane (concentration of the species to be separated) needs to be evaluated based on the aforementioned design parameters in order to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the system.

==Membrane Performance==
The concentration of species i and j across the membrane can be evaluated based on their respective diffusion flows across it.

:&lt;math&gt; n_i'' = \frac{J_i}{\sum{J_k}} , \quad   n_j ''= \frac{J_j}{\sum{J_k}} &lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a binary mixture, the concentration of species i across the membrane:

:&lt;math&gt; n_i'' = \frac{J_i}{J_i+J_j}&lt;/math&gt;
This can be further expanded to obtain an expression of the form:

:&lt;math&gt; n_i'' = n_i''(\phi, \alpha_{ij}, n_i^')&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; n_i'' = \frac{J_i}{J_i+J_j}= \frac{P_i(p_i'-p_i'')}{P_i(p_i'-p_i'')+P_j(n_j'-\frac{1}{\phi}n_j'')}    &lt;/math&gt;

Using the relations:

:&lt;math&gt; p_i'=p'n_i' ,\quad  p_j'=p'n_j' = \frac{p'}{\phi}n_i'   &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; p_i''=p''n_i' ,\quad  p_j''=p''n_j'' = \frac{p'}{\phi}n_i''   &lt;/math&gt;

The expression can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt; n_i''=\frac{P_ip'(n_i'-\frac{1}{\phi}n_i'')}{P_ip'(n_i'-\frac{1}{\phi}n_i'')+P_jp'(n_j'-\frac{1}{\phi}n_j'')}&lt;/math&gt;

Then using &lt;math&gt; n_j'=1-n_i'\quad  and \quad n_j'' =1-n_i'' &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; n_i''=\frac{P_ip'(n_i'-\frac{1}{\phi}n_i'')}{P_ip'(n_i'-\frac{1}{\phi}n_i'')+P_jp'((1-n_i')-\frac{1}{\phi}(1-n_i''))}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (1-\alpha)(n_i'')^2+(\phi+\phi(\alpha-1)n_i'+\alpha-1)n_i''-\alpha\phi n_i' =0 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilcox|first1=Jennifer|title=Carbon Capture|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4939-0125-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution to the above quadratic expression can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; n_i = \frac{-(\phi+\phi(\alpha-1)n_i'+\alpha-1)\pm \sqrt{\phi+\phi(\alpha-1)n_i'+\alpha-1)^2+4(1-\alpha)\alpha\phi n_i'}}{2(1-\alpha)} &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, an expression for the permeant concentration is obtained by the following:

:&lt;math&gt; n_i''(\phi \alpha n_i')=\frac{\phi}{2}\left(n_i'+\frac{1}{\phi}+\frac{1}{\alpha-1}-\sqrt{\left(n_i'+\frac{1}{\phi}+\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\right)^2-\frac{4\alpha n_i'}{(\alpha-1)\phi}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Along the separation unit, the feed concentration decays with the diffusion across the membrane causing the concentration at the membrane to drop accordingly. As a result, the total permeant flow (q"&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;) results from the integration of the diffusion flow across the membrane from the feed inlet (q'&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;) to feed outlet (q'&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;). A mass balance across a differential length of the separation unit is therefore:

:&lt;math&gt; q'(x)=q'(x+dx)+\int_{x}^{x+dx} q''(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;q''(x)=J_i(x)+J_j(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Because of the binary nature of the mixture, only one species needs to be evaluated. Prescribing a function n'&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=n'&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(x), the species balance can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt; q'(x)n'_i(x)=q'(x+\Delta x)n'_i(x+\Delta x) +\int_{x}^{x+dx}q''(x)dx \bar{n_i''} &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{x}^{x+dx} q''(x)dx= \delta q'', \quad \bar{n_i''}=\frac{n_i''(x)+n_i''(x+\Delta x)}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \delta q''= \frac{n'_i(x)-n'_i(x+\Delta x)}{\bar{n_i''}-n'_i(x+\Delta x)} q'(x) &lt;/math&gt;

Lastly, the area required per unit membrane length can be obtained by the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt; A=\frac{\delta q''}{J_i+J_j}&lt;/math&gt;

==Membrane Materials for Carbon Capture in Flue Gas Streams==
The material of the membrane plays an important role in its ability to provide the desired performance characteristics. It is optimal to have a membrane with a high permeability and sufficient selectivity and it is also important to match the membrane properties to that of the system operating conditions (for example pressures and gas composition).

Synthetic membranes are made from a variety of polymers including polyethylene, polyamides, polyimides, cellulose acetate, polysulphone and polydimethylsiloxan.&lt;ref name="gas_sep"&gt;{{cite book | title = Separation of Gases | last1 = Isalski | first1 = W. H. | year = 1989 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | series = Monograph on Cryogenics | volume = 5  | pages = 228–233  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymer Membranes===
[[Polymeric membranes]] are a common option for use in the capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from flue gas because of the maturity of the technology in a variety of industries, namely petrochemicals. The ideal polymer membrane has both a high [[Reactivity–selectivity principle|selectivity]] and [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]]. Polymer membranes are examples of systems that are dominated by the solution-diffusion mechanism. The membrane is considered to have holes which the gas can dissolve (solubility) and the molecules can move from one cavity to the other (diffusion).&lt;ref name="Smit" /&gt;

It was discovered by Robeson in the early 1990s that polymers with a high selectivity have a low permeability and opposite is true; materials with a low selectivity have a high permeability. This is best illustrated in a Robeson plot where the selectivity is plotted as a function of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeation. In this plot, the upper bound of selectivity is approximately a linear function of the permeability. It was found that the solubility in polymers is mostly constant but the diffusion coefficients vary significantly and this is where the engineering of the material occurs. Somewhat intuitively, the materials with the highest diffusion coefficients have a more open pore structure, thus losing selectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robeson|first1=L.M.|title=Correlation of separation factor versus permeability for polymeric membranes|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|date=1991|volume=62|issue=165|doi=10.1016/0376-7388(91)80060-j}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robeson|first1=L.M.|title=The upper bound revisited|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|date=2008|volume=320|issue=390|doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2008.04.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two methods that researchers are using to break the Robeson limit, one of these is the use of glassy polymers whose phase transition and changes in mechanical properties make it appear that the material is absorbing molecules and thus surpasses the upper limit. The second method of pushing the boundaries of the Robeson limit is by the facilitated transport method. As previously stated, the solubility of polymers is typically fairly constant but the facilitated transport method uses a chemical reaction to enhance the permeability of one component without changing the selectivity.&lt;ref name="Merkel"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merkel|first=Tim C.|last2=Lin|first2=Haiqing|last3=Wei|first3=Xiaotong|last4=Baker|first4=Richard|date=2010-09-01|title=Power plant post-combustion carbon dioxide capture: An opportunity for membranes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376738809007832|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|series=Membranes and CO2 Separation|volume=359|issue=1–2|pages=126–139|doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2009.10.041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanoporous Membranes===
[[File:Microscopic model of a nanoporous membrane.jpg|thumb|upright=2|right| Microscopic model of a nanoporous membrane. The white open area represents the area the molecule can pass through and the dark blue areas represent the membrane walls. The membrane channels consists of cavities and windows. The energy of the molecules in the cavity is U&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and the energy of a particle in the window is U&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
Nanoporous membranes are fundamentally different than polymer-based membranes in that their chemistry is different and that they do not follow the Robeson limit for a variety of reasons. The simplified figure of a nanoporous membrane shows a small portion of an example membrane structure with cavities and windows. The white portion represents the area where the molecule can move and the blue shaded areas represent the walls of the structure. In the engineering of these membranes, the size of the cavity (L&lt;sub&gt;cy&lt;/sub&gt; x L&lt;sub&gt;cz&lt;/sub&gt;) and window region (L&lt;sub&gt;wy&lt;/sub&gt; x L&lt;sub&gt;wz&lt;/sub&gt;) can be modified so that the desired permeation is achieved. It has been shown that the permeability of a membrane is the production of adsorption and diffusion. In low loading conditions, the adsorption can be computed by the Henry coefficient.&lt;ref name="Smit" /&gt;

If the assumption is made that the energy of a particle does not change when moving through this structure, only the entropy of the molecules changes based on the size of the openings. If we first consider changes the cavity geometry, the larger the cavity, the larger the entropy of the absorbed molecules which thus makes the Henry coefficient larger. For diffusion, an increase in entropy will lead to a decrease in free energy which in turn leads to a decrease in the diffusion coefficient. Conversely, changing the window geometry will primarily effect the diffusion of the molecules and not the Henry coefficient.

In summary, by using the above simplified analysis, it is possible to understand why the upper limit of the Robeson line does not hold for nanostructures. In the analysis, both the diffusion and Henry coefficients can be modified without affecting the permeability of the material which thus can exceed the upper limit for polymer membranes.&lt;ref name="Smit" /&gt;

==== Silica Membranes ====
Silica membranes are [[Mesoporous material|mesoporous]] and can be made with high uniformity (the same structure throughout the membrane). The high porosity of these membranes gives them very high permeabilities. Synthesized membranes have smooth surfaces and can be modified on the surface to drastically improve selectivity. Functionalizing silica membrane surfaces with amine containing molecules (on the surface [[silanol]] groups) allows the membranes to separate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from flue gas streams more effectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Surface functionalization (and thus chemistry) can be tuned to be more efficient for wet flue gas streams as compared to dry flue gas streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chew|first=Thiam-Leng|last2=Ahmad|first2=Abdul L.|last3=Bhatia|first3=Subhash|date=2010-01-15|title=Ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) as an adsorbent and membrane for separation of carbon dioxide (CO2)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001868609001092|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=153|issue=1–2|pages=43–57|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2009.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; While previously, silica membranes were impractical due to their technical scalability and cost (they are very difficult to produce in an economical manner on a large scale), there have been demonstrations of a simple method of producing silica membranes on hollow polymeric supports. These demonstrations indicate that economical materials and methods can effectively separate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hyung-Ju|last2=Chaikittisilp|first2=Watcharop|last3=Jang|first3=Kwang-Suk|last4=Didas|first4=Stephanie A.|last5=Johnson|first5=Justin R.|last6=Koros|first6=William J.|last7=Nair|first7=Sankar|last8=Jones|first8=Christopher W.|date=2015-04-29|title=Aziridine-Functionalized Mesoporous Silica Membranes on Polymeric Hollow Fibers: Synthesis and Single-Component CO2 and N2 Permeation Properties|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie503781u|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|volume=54|issue=16|pages=4407–4413|doi=10.1021/ie503781u|issn=0888-5885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordered mesoporous silica membranes have shown considerable potential for surface modification that allows for ease of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation. Surface functionalization with [[amine]]s leads to the reversible formation of [[carbamate]]s (during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flow), increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity significantly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Zeolite Membranes ====
[[File:Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png|thumb|A typical zeolite. Thin layers of this crystalline zeolite structure can act as a membrane, since CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can adsorb inside of the pores.]]
Zeolites are crystalline [[aluminosilicate]]s with a regular repeating structure of molecular-sized pores. Zeolite membranes selectively separate molecules based on pore size and polarity and are thus highly tunable to specific gas separation processes. In general, smaller molecules and those with stronger zeolite-[[adsorption]] properties are adsorbed onto zeolite membranes with larger selectivity. The capacity to discriminate based on both molecular size and adsorption affinity makes zeolite membranes an attractive candidate for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Scientists have found that the gas-phase enthalpy (heat) of adsorption on zeolites increases as follows: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poshusta|first=Joseph C|last2=Noble|first2=Richard D|last3=Falconer|first3=John L|date=2001-05-15|title=Characterization of SAPO-34 membranes by water adsorption|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376738800006669|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|volume=186|issue=1|pages=25–40|doi=10.1016/S0376-7388(00)00666-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the largest adsorption energy because it has the largest [[Quadrupole|quadrupole moment]], thereby increasing its affinity for charged or polar zeolite pores. At low temperatures, zeolite adsorption-capacity is large and the high concentration of adsorbed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules blocks the flow of other gases. Therefore, at lower temperatures, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectively permeates through zeolite pores. Several recent research efforts have focused on developing new zeolite membranes that maximize the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity by taking advantage of the low-temperature blocking phenomena.

Researchers have synthesized Y-type (Si:Al&gt;3) zeolite membranes which achieve room-temperature separation factors of 100 and 21 for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kusakabe|first=Katsuki|last2=Kuroda|first2=Takahiro|last3=Murata|first3=Atsushi|last4=Morooka|first4=Shigeharu|date=1997-03-01|title=Formation of a Y-Type Zeolite Membrane on a Porous α-Alumina Tube for Gas Separation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie960519x|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|volume=36|issue=3|pages=649–655|doi=10.1021/ie960519x|issn=0888-5885}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://america.iza-structure.org/IZA-SC/framework.php?STC=DDR DDR-type] and [http://www.acsmaterial.com/sapo-250.html SAPO-34] membranes have also shown promise in separating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a variety of pressures and feed compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Himeno|first=Shuji|last2=Tomita|first2=Toshihiro|last3=Suzuki|first3=Kenji|last4=Nakayama|first4=Kunio|last5=Yajima|first5=Kenji|last6=Yoshida|first6=Shuichi|date=2007-10-01|title=Synthesis and Permeation Properties of a DDR-Type Zeolite Membrane for Separation of CO2/CH4 Gaseous Mixtures|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie061682n|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|volume=46|issue=21|pages=6989–6997|doi=10.1021/ie061682n|issn=0888-5885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=S.|last2=Falconer|first2=J.

==== Metal-organic Framework (MOF) Membranes ====
There have been advances in [[Zeolitic imidazolate framework|zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks]] (ZIFs), a subclass of [[metal-organic framework]]s (MOFs), that have allowed them to be useful for carbon dioxide separation from flue gas streams.

[[File:CMR1.PNG|thumb|Structure of a perovskite. A membrane would consist of a thin layer of the perovskite structure.]]

==== Perovskite Membranes ====
[[Perovskite]] are mixed metal oxide with a well-defined cubic structure and a general formula of ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where A is an [[Alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]] or [[lanthanide]] element and B is a [[transition metal]]. These materials are attractive for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation because of the tunability of the metal sites as well as their stabilities at elevated temperatures.

The separation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was investigated with an α-alumina membrane impregnated with BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037673889400109X|title=Separation of CO2 with BaTiO3 membrane prepared by the sol—gel method |language=en|access-date=2017-05-05|doi=10.1016/0376-7388(94)00109-X|volume=95|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|pages=171–177 | last1 = Kusakabe | first1 = Katsuki}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was favorable at high temperatures due to an endothermic interaction between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the material, promoting mobile CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption-desorption rate and surface diffusion. The experimental separation factor of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found to be 1.1-1.2 at 100&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C to 500&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, which is higher than the separation factor limit of 0.8 predicted by [[Knudsen diffusion]]. Though the separation factor was low due to pinholes observed in the membrane, this demonstrates the potential of perovskite materials in their selective surface chemistry for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation.

==Current Status of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture with Membranes==
A great deal of research has been undertaken to utilize membranes instead of absorption or adsorption for carbon capture from flue gas streams, however, no current projects exist that utilize membranes. Process engineering along with new developments in materials have shown that membranes have the greatest potential for low energy penalty and cost compared to competing technologies.&lt;ref name="Smit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Merkel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brunetti" /&gt;

=== Background ===
Today, membranes are used for commercial separations involving: N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from air, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from ammonia in the [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch process]], [[Natural-gas processing|natural gas purification]], and tertiary-level [[Enhanced oil recovery|Enhanced Oil Recovery]] supply.&lt;ref name="Bernardo"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernardo P., Clarizia G.|first=|date=|title=30 Years of Membrane Technology for Gas Separation|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/af85/934fa668a312d3e71c284ced478c12edfd16.pdf|journal=The Italian Association of Chemical Engineering|volume=32 | year = 2013 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Single-stage membrane operations involve a single membrane with one selectivity value. Single-stage membranes were first used in natural gas purification, separating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from methane.&lt;ref name="Bernardo" /&gt; A disadvantage of single-stage membranes is the loss of product in the permeate due to the constraints imposed by the single selectivity value. Increasing the selectivity reduces the amount of product lost in the permeate, but comes at the cost of requiring a larger pressure difference to process an equivalent amount of a flue stream. In practice, the maximum pressure ratio economically possible is around 5:1.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Richard W.|date=2002-03-01|title=Future Directions of Membrane Gas Separation Technology|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie0108088|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|volume=41|issue=6|pages=1393–1411|doi=10.1021/ie0108088|issn=0888-5885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat the loss of product in the membrane permeate, engineers use “cascade processes” in which the permeate is recompressed and interfaced with additional, higher selectivity membranes.&lt;ref name="Bernardo" /&gt; The retentate streams can be recycled, which achieves a better yield of product.

=== Need for multi-stage process ===
Single stage membranes devices are not feasible for obtaining a high concentration of separated material in the [[permeate]] stream. This is due to the pressure ratio limit that is economically unrealistic to exceed. Therefore, the use of multi stage membranes is required to concentrate the permeate stream. The use of a second stage allows for less membrane area and power to be used. This is because of the higher concentration that passes the second stage, as well as the lower volume of gas for the pump to process.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Merkel"/&gt; Other factors, such as adding another stage that uses air to concentrate the stream further reduces cost by increasing concentration within the feed stream.&lt;ref name="Merkel" /&gt; Additional methods such as combining multiple types of separation methods allow for variation in creating economical process designs.

=== Membrane Use in Hybrid Processes ===
Hybrid processes have long standing history with gas separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernardo P., Clarizia G|first=|date=|title=30 Years of Membrane Technology for Gas Separation|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/af85/934fa668a312d3e71c284ced478c12edfd16.pdf|journal=The Italian Association of Chemical Engineering|volume=32 | year = 2013 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, membranes are integrated into already existing processes such that they can be retrofitted into already existing carbon capture systems.

MTR, Membrane Technology and Research Inc., and [[University of Texas at Austin|UT Austin]] have worked to create hybrid processes, utilizing both absorption and membranes, for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture.  First, an [[Carbon dioxide scrubber|absorption]] column using [[piperazine]] as a solvent absorbs about half the carbon dioxide in the flue gas, then the use of a membrane results in 90% capture.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610214018803?via=ihub|title=Hybrid Membrane-absorption CO2 Capture Process |last=Brice Freeman, Pingjiao Hao, Richard Baker, Jay Kniep, Eric Chen, Junyuan Ding, Yue Zhang Gary T. Rochelle.|first=|date=|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-28|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2014.11.065|volume=63|journal=Energy Procedia|pages=605–613}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A parallel setup is also, with the membrane and absorption processes occurring simultaneously.  Generally, these processes are most effective when the highest content of carbon dioxide enters the amine absorption column. Incorporating hybrid design processes allows for retrofitting into [[fossil fuel]] power plants.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt;

Hybrid processes can also use [[Air separation|cryogenic distillation]] and membranes.&lt;ref name="Lin"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Haiqing|last2=He|first2=Zhenjie|last3=Sun|first3=Zhen|last4=Kniep|first4=Jay|last5=Ng|first5=Alvin|last6=Baker|first6=Richard W.|last7=Merkel|first7=Timothy C.|date=2015-11-01|title=CO2-selective membranes for hydrogen production and CO2 capture – Part II: Techno-economic analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376738815001635|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|volume=493|pages=794–806|doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2015.02.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] can be separated, first using cryogenic gas separation, whereby most of the carbon dioxide exits first, then using a membrane process to separate the remaining carbon dioxide, after which it is recycled for further attempts at cryogenic separation.&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt;

=== Cost Analysis of Current Membrane Technology for CCS Relative to Well Established Techniques ===
Cost limits the pressure ratio in a membrane [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] separation stage to a value of 5; higher pressure rations eliminate any economic viability for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture using membrane processes.&lt;ref name="Merkel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Yu|last2=Merkel|first2=Tim C.|last3=Baker|first3=Richard W.|date=2014-08-01|title=Pressure ratio and its impact on membrane gas separation processes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037673881400194X|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|volume=463|pages=33–40|doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent studies have demonstrated that multi-stage CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture/separation processes using membranes can be economically competitive with older and more common technologies such as amine-based [[Carbon dioxide scrubber|absorption]].&lt;ref name="Merkel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt; Currently, both membrane and amine-based absorption processes can be designed to yield a 90% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture rate.&lt;ref name="Brunetti"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brunetti|first=A.|last2=Scura|first2=F.|last3=Barbieri|first3=G.|last4=Drioli|first4=E.|date=2010-09-01|title=Membrane technologies for CO2 separation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376738809008540|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|series=Membranes and CO2 Separation|volume=359|issue=1–2|pages=115–125|doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2009.11.040}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merkel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hao"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hao|first=Pingjiao|last2=Wijmans|first2=J.

== Controversial practices ==

===Security===
Mint asks users to provide both the user names and the passwords to their bank accounts, credit cards, and other financial accounts, which Mint then stores in their databases in a decryptable format.  This has raised concerns that if the Mint databases were ever hacked, both user names and passwords would become available to rogue third parties.  Some banks support a separate "access code" for read-only access to financial information, which reduces the risk to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In January 2017, Intuit and [[JPMorgan Chase]] settled a longstanding dispute, and agreed to develop software where Chase customers send their data, for financial purposes, to Mint without having Intuit store customers' names and passwords. It was also agreed Intuit would never sell Chase’s customer data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2017/01/25/chase-mint-reach-deal-faster-more-secure-data-sharing/97059434/|title=Chase, Mint reach deal for faster, more secure data-sharing|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Silver]] is ductile enough to be stretched into a monatomic wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.5772/62288 |isbn=978-953-51-2252-4 |chapter=Combined Transmission Electron Microscopy – In situ Observation of the Formation Process and Measurement of Physical Properties for Single Atomic-Sized Metallic Wires |author=Masuda, Hideki |title=Modern Electron Microscopy in Physical and Life Sciences |editor=Janecek, Milos |editor2=Kral, Robert |publisher=InTech |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
{{example farm|section|date=January 2018}}
Monomolecular wire is often used as a weapon in fiction. It has applications in cutting objects and severing adjacent molecules. A similar or identical concept may be called a '''microfilament wire''' or, as a weapon, a '''microfilament whip'''.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Among the first references in fiction to a monofilament is in [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'' (1968), where hobby terrorists deploy this over-the-shelf General Technics product across roads to kill or injure the people passing there. According to Brunner, the monofilament will easily cut through glass, metal and flesh, but in any non-strained structure the molecules will immediately rebond. No harm is done if the cut object is not under mechanical stress.

An early example of a substance similar to monomolecular wire is '[[borazon]]-tungsten filament' from [[Randall Garrett|G. Randall Garrett]]'s "Thin Edge." (Analog, Dec 1963)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30869/&lt;/ref&gt;  The main character uses a strand from an asteroid towing-cable to cut jail bars and to [[booby-trap]] the door of his room.  [[Frank Herbert]] later described [[shigawire]] in his ''Dune'' novels. First making its appearance in ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965), shigawire is a metallic extrusion produced naturally from a ground vine found on the planets [[Salusa Secundus]] and [[III Delta Kaising]]. It varies in diameter from approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm down to monomolecular (micronic) diameters, and is notable for its incredible tensile and mechanical strength.
Shigawire is able to cut through almost any material cleanly, possessing edges that are incredibly sharp. It is a weapon of choice for assassins.

Monomolecular wire is a plot element in the short story "[[Johnny Mnemonic]]" by [[William Gibson]]. The assassin following the protagonist has a [[diamond]] spindle of monomolecular wire (or filament) implanted in his thumb, the idea being that diamond is also made of a single molecule and thus hard enough to not be cut by a monomolecular wire. The top of a prosthesis, attached to the other side of the wire, was used as a weight and the wire could be used as a whip-like weapon or a [[garotte]].

Monomolecular wire (in the form of wide 'tapes' of a "pseudo-one-dimensional modified diamond crystal") is used as the basic building material of the space elevator in Arthur C. Clarke's novel ''[[The Fountains of Paradise]]''.

Monomolecular wires are seen in the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]], ''[[Cyber City Oedo 808]]'', ''[[Hyperion Cantos]]'', [[Robert J. Sawyer|Robert J. Sawyer's]] ''[[Illegal Alien (Sawyer novel)|Illegal Alien]]'', ''[[Battle Angel Alita]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Akame ga Kill]]'', ''[[Hellsing]]'', ''[[Trinity Blood]]'', ''[[My-Hime]]'', [[Vampire Knight]], [[Simon R. Green|Simon R. Green's]] ''[[Deathstalker]]'' series, [[Alastair Reynolds|Alastair Reynolds's]] ''[[Revelation Space]]'' universe, as well as the [[roleplaying game]]s ''[[Shadowrun]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'' as Doflamingo's string-string devil fruit and ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]''. Monomolecular wires are also seen in [[Larry Niven]]'s "[[Known Space]]" universe as human-produced "Sinclair Molecule Chain".

In the [[One Piece]] manga, the character Donquixote Doflamingo ate the Ito Ito no Mi, a devil fruit that grants the user the ability to create and manipulate strings. He is capable of creating strings so thin that they cannot be seen, and he can use this ability to ensnare people and control them like a puppet. His strings are also incredibly strong, being able to cut through stone with ease.

Various [[Imperium of Man|Imperial]] and alien technologies in the ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' universe use monomolecular blades or wire offensively. Possibly the most notable example are [[Eldar (Warhammer 40,000)|Eldar]] Warp Spiders, whose [[Weapons, equipment and vehicles of the Craftworld Eldar (Warhammer 40,000)#Monofilament weapons|Deathspinner]] weaponry traps targets in a mesh of such filaments or the Dark Eldar Shredder weapon which shoots meshes of it.

The game [[Chaos Overlords]] featured a weapon 'monom rod' which used this technology.

Sion Eltnam Atlasia wields a monofilament whip called the Etherlite in [[Melty Blood]]. 

In the 2000 film ''[[XChange (film)|XChange]]'', the main character acquires an Urban survival Kit which includes a monomolecular wire.

Monomolecular swords are used by some [[Kzin]] in [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[Known Space]]'' series.

Monomolecular wire ranks 14th on [[IGN]]'s list of the "25 Coolest Sci-Fi weapons".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/29/the-25-coolest-sci-fi-movie-weapons?page=3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multi-channel length''' is a technique for reducing power leakage in both active and idle modes on [[CMOS]] technology.  Other techniques to reduce leakage, like [[power gating]] and [[SRAM retention]], are targeted at reducing leakage power when the device, or portions of it, are not operating.  

Short channel length devices provide higher performance than longer channel length devices, but the longer channel length has significantly reduced [[subthreshold leakage]] current. In this generation of the power management tool box, two channel lengths summarized in the table below were used for the speed vs. leakage trade-off.

Timing-critical paths are constructed of short channel length cells, but for non timing-critical paths, the longer channel length cells can be used to trade off speed for lower leakage. Multiple channel length synthesis achieves up to 30% leakage reduction.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} One additional usage of longer channel length transistors is for always-on logic and for special power management cells (isolation cells, always on buffers, etc.) where speed is not critical.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6502">[[Image:Needle-gun-uss-kitty-hawk.jpg|thumb|right|A U.S. Navy Seaman uses a needle-gun to remove old paint and corrosion aboard [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk'']].&lt;ref name="nn"&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/view_single.asp?id=33020 U.S. Navy, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''needlegun scaler''', '''needle scaler''' or '''needle-gun''' is a tool used to remove [[rust]], [[mill scale]], and old paint from metal surfaces.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;NETC, 2003, p. 11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tool is used in metalwork applications as diverse as home repair, automotive repair and shipboard preservation.&lt;ref name="m08"&gt;Miller, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="park"&gt;Park, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns"&gt;NAVSEA, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Operation and use==
A needle gun has a set of very fine chisels known as needles.&lt;ref name="m08"/&gt;  The tool forces these needles against a work surface at variable speeds up to around 5,000 times per minute.&lt;ref name="m08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;  Different models offer choices of number of needles, operating speed, and power levels.&lt;ref name="m08"/&gt;  Many models use [[compressed air]], although electrical needle-guns do exist.&lt;ref name="m08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nk"&gt;Nitto Kohki, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pneumatic unit, compressed air forces a piston forwards and backwards.&lt;ref name="m08"/&gt;  This movement causes the needles to move back and forth against the work surface.&lt;ref name="m08"/&gt;

[[Image:Able-seaman-scaling-winch.JPG|thumb|right|An [[able seaman]] uses a needlegun to remove scale while refurbishing a mooring winch.]]The needle gun has advantages over other scaling tools. Its main advantage is that the needles automatically adjust themselves to contours, making the tool a good choice for cleaning irregular surfaces.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; A needle gun can clean an area to bare metal in seconds, and compares well to other scaling tools in terms of accuracy and precision.&lt;ref name="m08"/&gt;

It is recommended that before needlegunning, a surface should be prepared by removing oil, grease, dirt, chemicals and water-soluble contaminants.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt; This can be done with solvents or with a combination of detergent and fresh water.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt;
Then, the needle gun is used to remove rust, loose scale, and paint, leaving bare metal.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt; It is used most effectively by holding it at a 45° angle to the work surface.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt; It is recommended that an area no larger than six to eight inches be cleared at once.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt; Two to three passes over an area is generally sufficient to clean it.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt; Then the process is repeated until the desired area is completed.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt;

Prior to painting, it is desirable to feather any edges between metal and old paint.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt; It is also important to check the surface for oil deposited during chipping, and if necessary, clean the area with solvents.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt; Since bare metal surfaces will flash rust soon after exposure to the atmosphere, paint should be applied as soon as possible after  chipping.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt;  If flash rusting occurs prior to coating, further chipping, cleaning and sanding may be necessary.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt;

The '''Network Test Automation Forum (NTAF)''', founded in 2010, is a nonprofit international industry alliance, dedicated to promoting interoperability of commercial network testing tools and testing infrastructure, by defining and facilitating adoption of technical specifications.

The forum is composed of leading service providers, network equipment vendors, and other networking companies that share an interest in test automation and interoperability. As of November 2012, it has 14 members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntaforum.org/members/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2009, 11 founding members (BreakingPoint, [[BT Group|BT]], [[Cisco]], [[Fanfare]], [[Empirix]], [[Ericsson]], [[EXFO]], [[Ixia]], [[JDSU]], [[Spirent]] and [[Verizon]]) met in Chicago and expressed an interest in forming an industry alliance to bring together commercial testing vendors, test equipment vendors, and other industry experts to create interoperable testing solutions for service providers, network equipment manufacturers (NEMs), and other enterprise organizations with large network deployments. The result was the Network Test Automation Forum entity, which was set up in 2010 following the first face-to-face meeting in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fanfaresoftware.com/news-and-events/press-releases/global-companies-demand-testing-interoperability&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiercetelecom.com/story/network-test-automation-forum-addresses-time-market-pressures/2010-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lightwaveonline.com/articles/2010/03/network-test-automation-forum-launches-advocates-collaboration-and-interoperability-of-vendor-test-tools--87980227.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goal==
To facilitate and promote the interoperability of commercial testing tools and test infrastructure for the data communications and telecommunications industry.

NTAF will bring together commercial testing vendors, test equipment vendors, and other industry experts to create interoperable testing solutions for service providers, network equipment manufacturers (NEMs), and other enterprise organizations with large network deployments.

==Objectives==
The objectives of NTAF are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntaforum.org/about/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Build consensus and unite service providers, network equipment manufacturers, and test equipment vendors on network test automation technical specifications and interoperability.
* Create, facilitate and enable the implementation of network test automation specifications.
* Enhance market awareness of the benefits of interoperable network test automation.

==Members==
As of July 2013, NTAF has the following members:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntaforum.org/members/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
In June 2011, NTAF ratified two sets of specifications dealing with registration, discovery and activation of tools and defining tool harnesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eetimes.com/design/industrial-control/4218488/Network-test-specs-promote-multi-vendor-interoperability-in-the-lab?Ecosystem=industrial-control&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4216721/NTAF-releases-specification-for-network-test-automation?Ecosystem=test-and-measurement&lt;/ref&gt;

===TS-001: Tool Registration, Discovery and Activation===
This specification describes an XMPP extension that allows an application or tool to register itself in a way that other interested entities can discover its existence. It also describes the mechanism by which a tool can be activated so that its automation harnesses are available for use.

===TS-002: Tool Automation Harness===
This specification describes an XMPP extension that allows an application or tool, with or without its own specialized man-machine user interface to expose an "automation harness" that allows that tool to be controlled and/or monitored by another tool via XMPP packet exchanges.

==Future Direction==
The NTAF Technical Committee is currently working on draft specifications for resource and inventory management:

===WT-003: Tool Resource===
This working document describes an NTAF extension that allows tools to communicate resource data. It is based on the TS-001 and TS-002 specifications and its primary focus is to support automated inventory management.

===WT-004: Inventory===
This working document describes an NTAF extension that supports the automatic population of inventory records with key equipment/resource parameters within a test lab environment. It is based on the TS-001 and TS002 specifications and the WT-003 proposal.

'''Open Agent Architecture''' or '''OAA''' for short is a [[Application framework|framework]] for integrating a community of heterogeneous [[software agent]]s in a distributed environment. It is also a research project of the [[SRI International]] [[Artificial Intelligence Center]].

Roughly, the architecture is that a central "blackboard" server holds a list of tasks, while a group of agent machines executes these tasks based on their specific capabilities.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to human–computer interaction:

'''[[Human–computer interaction]]''' – the intersection of computer science and behavioral sciences, this field involves the study, planning, and design of the interaction between people (users) and computers. Attention to human-machine interaction is important, because poorly designed human-machine interfaces can lead to many unexpected problems. A classic example of this is the [[Three Mile Island accident]] where investigations concluded that the design of the human–machine interface was at least partially responsible for the disaster.

== What ''type'' of thing is human–computer interaction? ==

Human–computer interaction can be described as all of the following:
* A field of science – systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.&lt;ref&gt;"... modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by mathematics; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions."&amp;nbsp;—p.vii, [[J. L. Heilbron]], (2003, editor-in-chief) ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science'' New York: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-511229-6}}
*{{cite dictionary |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |title=science |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/science |accessdate=2011-10-16 |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]], Inc |quote='''3 a:''' knowledge or a system of knowledge covering general truths or the operation of general laws especially as obtained and tested through scientific method '''b:''' such knowledge or such a system of knowledge concerned with the physical world and its phenomena }}
&lt;!--{{sfn|Popper|2002|p=3}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
** An [[applied science]] – field that applies human knowledge to build or design useful things.
*** A field of [[computer science]] – scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications.
** An application of engineering – science, skill, and profession of acquiring and applying scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge, to design and also build structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes.
*** An application of software engineering – application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software.&lt;ref name="BoDu04"&gt;[[Software Engineering Body of Knowledge|SWEBOK]] {{Cite book| editors = Pierre Bourque and Robert Dupuis |   title = Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge – 2004 Version | publisher = [[IEEE Computer Society]] | year = 2004 | pages = 1–1 | isbn = 0-7695-2330-7 | url = http://www.swebok.org | author = executive editors, Alain Abran, James W.

&lt;/ref&gt;
**** A subfield of [[computer programming]] – process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written in one or more programming languages (such as Java, C++, C#, Python, Php etc.). The purpose of programming is to create a set of instructions that computers use to perform specific operations or to exhibit desired behaviors.
** A [[social science]] – academic discipline concerned with society and human behavior.
*** A [[behavioural sciences|behavioural science]] – discipline that explores the activities of and interactions among organisms. It involves the systematic analysis and investigation of human and animal behaviour through controlled and naturalistic observation, and disciplined scientific experimentation. Examples of behavioural sciences include psychology, psychobiology, and cognitive science.
* A type of [[system]] – set of interacting or interdependent components forming an integrated whole or a set of elements (often called 'components' ) and relationships which are different from relationships of the set or its elements to other elements or sets.
** A system that includes software –  software is a collection of computer programs and related data that provides the instructions for telling a computer what to do and how to do it. Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer. In other words, software is a set of programs, procedures, algorithms and its documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system.
* A type of technology – making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, methods of organization, to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments.
** A form of computer technology – computers and their application.

A '''penetration''', in [[firestop]]ping, is an ''opening'', such as one created by the use of a cast-in-place [[Sleeve (construction)|sleeve]], in a wall or floor assembly required to have a [[fire-resistance rating]], for the purpose of accommodating the passage of a mechanical, electrical or structural [[penetrant (mechanical, electrical, or structural)|penetrant]]. The penetration may or may not contain a firestop system. A ''penetration'' is not a ''penetrant''. A penetration may or may not include a penetrant.

==Old terminology==

The nuclear industry in particular used to refer to firestops as "penetration seals" or "penseals". These terms are superseded by the term [[firestop]]. Whereas penetration seals or penseals only dealt with openings made to accommodate [[penetrant (mechanical, electrical, or structural)|penetrants]], firestops now also include [[Joint (building)]].

==Why the term "Penetration (firestop)"?==

It is useful to have clarity in [[construction]] communications, to differentiate between the ''opening'', whether sealed or not, and the [[penetrant (mechanical, electrical, or structural)|penetrants]], which are optional components of a penetration, as sometimes openings (penetrations of the fire barrier) are created for future use, especially in electrical service rooms. A firestop, after all, tends to be easier to remove than [[concrete]], which requires coredrilling equipment, cooling water, etc. A firestopped penetration may also be referred to as a firestop, as a firestop, by definition, is a [[system]]. Therefore, the terms ''firestop'' and ''penetration'' can at times be deemed to be interchangeable.

'''Pentolite''' is a composite [[high explosive]] used for military and civilian purposes, e.g., warheads and [[explosive booster|booster charges]]. It is made of PETN [[phlegmatized]] with TNT by melt casting.&lt;ref name=LLNL&gt;B. M. Dobratz &amp; P. C. Crawford, ''LLNL Explosives Handbook'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, UCRL-52997, Change 2, January 31, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common military variety of pentolite (designated "Pentolite 50/50") is a mixture of 50% pentaerythritol tetranitrate ([[PETN]]) and 50% [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT).&lt;ref name=LLNL/&gt; (Unlike other compound explosives, the number before the slash is the mass percentage of TNT and the second number is the mass percentage of PETN). This 50:50 mixture has a density of 1.65 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a [[detonation velocity]] of 7400 m/s. 

Civilian pentolite sometimes contains a lower percentage of PETN, usually around 2% ("Pentolite 98/2"), 5% ("Pentolite 95/5") or 10% ("Pentolite 90/10"). Civilian pentolites have a [[detonation velocity]] of about 7,800 metres per second.

A '''portable emissions measurement system''' ('''PEMS''') is a [[Vehicle emissions control|vehicle emissions]] testing device that is small and light enough to be carried inside or moved with a [[motor vehicle]] that is being driven during testing, rather than on the stationary rollers of a [[dynamometer]] that only simulates real-world driving. 

Early examples of mobile vehicle emissions equipment were developed and marketed in the early 1990s by Warren Spring Laboratory UK during the early 1990s, which was used to measure on-road emissions as part of the UK Environment Research Program.  Governmental agencies like [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA), [[European Union]],{{Which?|reason=The EU isn't an agency. Which agency is this referring to?|date=April 2018}}, and various states and private entities have begun to use PEMS in order to reduce both the costs and time involved in making mobile emissions decisions.

==Introduction of PEMS==

Leo Breton of the US EPA invented the Real-time On-road Vehicle Emissions Reporter (ROVER) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-03/documents/02132002mstrs_johnson.pdf| title = ROVER - Real-time On-road Vehicle Emissions Reporter Dennis Johnson, US EPA| last = Johson| first = Dennis| date = 2002-02-13| website = Real-time On-road Vehicle Emissions Reporter Dennis Johnson, US EPA

These early field devices used engine data from either an [[on-board diagnostics]] (OBD) port, or directly from an engine sensor array. The first unit was developed for, and sold to - Dr. H. Christopher Frey of North Carolina State University (NCSU) for the first on-road testing project, which was sponsored by the North Carolina Department of Transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10473289.2003.10466245]&lt;/ref&gt;  David W. Miller, who co-founded CATI, first coined the phrase "Portable Emissions Measurement System" and "PEMS" when working on a 2000 [[File:WTC 2002 - CATI PEMS.jpg |thumb|upright|A CATI PEMS testing in the field at the World Trade Center in 2002]] New York City Metropolitan Transportation Agency bus project with Dr. Thomas Lanni of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749103000241]&lt;/ref&gt; as a short-hand description of the new device. Other governmental groups and universities soon followed, and quickly began to use the equipment due to its balance of accuracy, low cost, light weight, and availability. From 1999 through 2004, research groups such as Virginia Tech,&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.research.vt.edu/scholar-of-the-week/hesham-rakha Virginia Tech]&lt;/ref&gt; Penn State, and  Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tti.tamu.edu/group/airquality/]&lt;/ref&gt; Texas Southern University and others began to use PEMS in border crossing projects,  roadway evaluations],  traffic control methods, before-and-after scenarios,{{what?|date=April 2018}} and ferries, planes, and off-road vehicles, to explore what was possible outside of a lab environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.harc.edu/Projects/AirQuality/Projects/H008B.2003/BY/H8BBYFinalReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tti.tamu.edu/group/airquality/files/2010/11/Emissions-of-Mexican-Domiciled-Heavy-Duty-Diesel-Trucks-Using-Alternative-Fuels.pdf border crossing projects]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~frey/conf_pr/Unal_Frey_Rouphail_Colyar_2002.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246054490_EMISSIONS_AND_TRAFFIC_CONTROL_AN_EMPIRICAL_APPROACH traffic control methods]&lt;/ref&gt;  A project performed in April 2002 by the [[California Air Resources Board]](CARB) - using non-1065 PEMS equipment,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/onroadhd/hdiut.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; tested 40 trucks over a period of 2½ days;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/m17/cati.doc]&lt;/ref&gt; of which, 22 trucks were tested on road in Tulare, California.  During this time, a high-profile project performed with early PEMS equipment was the World Trade Center (WTC) Ground Zero Project in lower Manhattan,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cleanaircommunities.org/projects/wtc.html World Trade Center (WTC) Ground Zero Project in lower Manhattan]&lt;/ref&gt; testing concrete pumpers, bulldozers, graders, and later - diesel cranes on Building #7 - 40 stories high. Other early PEMS projects such as Dr. Chris Frey's field work was used by the USEPA in the development of the MOVES Model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.epa.gov/otaq/models/moves/index.htm MOVES Model]&lt;/ref&gt; However, users such as regulators and vehicle manufacturers had to wait for ROVER to be commercialized to conduct actual measurements of mass emissions rather than depend on estimates of mass emissions using data the OBD port, or a direct engine measurement, in order to have a more defensible data set.  This push led to a new 2005 standard known as CFR 40 Part 1065.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6aca586aebc6de74a06dea2a85f5a5ab&amp;mc=true&amp;node=sp40.37.1065.j&amp;rgn=div6 CFR 40 Part 1065]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many governmental entities (such as the USEPA and the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] or [[UNFCCC]]) have identified  target mobile-source pollutants in various mobile standards as [[CO2]], [[NOx]], [[Atmospheric particulate matter|Particulate Matter]] (PM), [[Carbon Monoxide]] (CO), [[Hydrocarbons]](HC), to ensure that emissions standards are being met.  Further, these governing bodies have begun adopting in-use testing program for [[non-road diesel engine]]s, as well as other types of internal combustion engines, and are requiring the use of PEMS testing.  It is important to delineate the various classifications of the latest 'transferable' emissions testing equipment from-time PEMS equipment, in order to best understand the desire of portability in field-testing of emissions.

==Economic advantage of PEMS equipment==
[[File:Next generation iPEMS 1.jpg|thumb|A next generation "integrated PEMS" (iPEMS) device.]]
Because a PEMS unit is able to be carried easily by one person from jobsite to jobsite, and can be used without the requirement of 'team lifting', the required emissions testing projects are economically viable.  Simply put, more testing can be done more quickly, by less workers, dramatically increasing the amount of testing done in a certain time period.  This in turn, significantly reduces the 'cost per test', yet at the same time increases the overall accuracy required in a 'real-world' environment.&lt;ref&gt;El-Shawarby I., Ahn K., and Rakha H. (2005), Comparative Field Evaluation of Vehicle Cruise Speed and Acceleration Level Impacts on Hot Stabilized Emissions. Transportation Research Part D, 10 (1), pp 13–30.&lt;/ref&gt;   Because the [[law of large numbers]] will create a convergence of results, it means that repeatability, predictability, and accuracy are enhanced, while simultaneously reducing the overall cost of the testing.

==On-road emissions patterns identified by PEMS==

Nearly all modern engines, when tested new and according to the accepted testing protocols in a laboratory, produce relatively low emissions well within the set standards. As all individual engines of the same series are supposed to be identical, only one or several engines of each series get tested.  The tests have shown that:

# The bulk of the total emissions can come from relatively short high-emissions episodes
# Emissions characteristics can be different even among otherwise identical engines
# Emissions outside of the bounds of the laboratory test procedures are often higher than under the operating and ambient conditions comparable to those during laboratory testing
#Emissions deteriorate significantly over the useful life of the vehicles
#There are large variances among the deterioration rates, with the high emissions rates often attributable to various mechanical malfunctions

These findings are consistent with published literature, and with the data from a myriad of subsequent studies. They are more applicable to spark-ignition engines and considerably less to diesels, but with the regulation-driven advances in diesel engine technology (comparable to the advances in [[spark-ignition]] engines since the 1970s) it can be expected that these findings are likely to be applicable to the new generation diesel engines.  Since 2000, multiple entities have used PEMS data to measured in-use, on-road emissions on hundreds of diesel engines installed in school buses, transit buses, delivery trucks, plow trucks, over-the-road trucks, pickups, vans, forklifts, excavators, generators, loaders, compressors, locomotives, passenger ferries, and other on-road, off-road and [[Non-road engine|non-road applications]]. All the previously listed findings were demonstrated; in addition, it was noticed that extended idling of engines can have a significant impact on the emissions during subsequent operation.

Also, PEMS testing identified several engine "anomalies"where fuel-specific NOx emissions were two to three times higher than expected during some modes of operation, suggesting deliberate alterations of the [[engine control unit]] (ECU) settings.  Such data set can be readily used for developing emissions inventories, as well as to evaluate various improvements in engines, fuels, exhaust after-treatment and other areas. (Data collected on "conventional"fleets then serves as "baseline"data to which various improvements are compared.) This data set can also be examined for compliance with not-to-exceed (NTE) and in-use [[emissions standards]], which are 'US-based' emission standards that require on-road testing.

==Accuracy of PEMS==

[[File:AVL PEMS - attached on a passenger car.jpg|thumb|1065 PEMS manufactured by AVL - attached on a passenger car]]
It is often difficult for PEMS to offer the same accuracy and variety of species measured as is possible with top of the line laboratory instrumentation because PEMS are typically limited in size, weight and power consumption. For this reason, objections were raised{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} against using PEMS for compliance verification. But there is also the potential for inaccuracy in fleet emissions deduced from laboratory measurements. For this reason, European [[Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure|WLTP]] results from PEMS will be weighted with a conformity factor of 2.1 (1.5 after 2019), i.e. the emissions measured by the PEMS are allowed to be a factor 2.1 higher than the limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-2821_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - EU action to curb air pollution by cars: Questions and Answers|website=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is expected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fulper|first1=Carl|title=Chemical Engineer|url=http://www.cert.ucr.edu/events/pems2013/agenda/04_fulper_carl.pdf|website=https://www.epa.gov/moves/mobile-source-emission-factors-research|publisher=CE-CERT|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a variety of on-board systems will be designed, ranging from bread-box sized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ropkins|first1=Karl|title=Dr.|url=http://www.cert.ucr.edu/events/pems/20b%20-%20AndrewBurnette_parSYNCiPEMS-DieselInspectionMaintenance.pdf|website=http://www.cert.ucr.edu/events/pems/|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=David|title=Inventor|url=http://www.3datx.com/products-services/|website=www.3DATX.com|publisher=3DATX|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEMS to instrumented trailers towed behind the tested truck&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Durbin|first1=Tom|title=Dr.|url=https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/seminars/durbin3/durbin3.pdf|website=https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/seminars/|publisher=CARB|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The benefits of each approach need to be considered in light of other sources of errors associated with emissions monitoring, notably vehicle-to-vehicle differences, and the emissions variability within the vehicle itself.

==Additional PEMS criteria==
[[File:Semtech in a car.jpg|thumb|Sensors Inc. PEMS equipment]]
PEMS need to be safe enough to use on public roads. During testing, portable emissions systems could attach extensions of the tailpipe, add lines and cables outside the vehicle, carry [[lead-acid batteries]] in the passenger compartment, have hot components accessible to bystanders, block emergency exits, or interfe with the driver, or have loose components that could be caught in moving parts. Modifications to or disassembly of the tested vehicle such as drilling into the exhaust, removing intake air system) need to be examined for their acceptance by both fleet managers and drivers, especially on passenger-carrying vehicles. The test equipment can not draw excessive electrical load from the test vehicle. Instead, sealed lead-acid batteries, [[fuel cells]] and [[Electric generator|generators]] have been used as external power sources, though they may add other hazards during driving.

The more time and expertise installation of the equipment requires, the greater the cost of testing, limiting the number of vehicles that can be tested. More testing is also possible with equipment that is versatile enough to be used on more than one type of vehicle. The weight and size of the equipment and consumables like calibration gases might limit moving to a sufficient number locations. Any restrictions on transport of hazardous materials (i.e.[[Flame ionization detector]] (FID) fuel or calibration gases) need to be taken into the account. The ability of the test crew to repair PEMS in the field using locally available resources can also be essential.

==PEMS suitability to application==
Ultimately, it should be demonstrated to show that a PEMS is suitable to the desired application. If the ultimate goal is to verify the compliance with in-use emissions requirements, a fleet of vehicles with known characteristics – including engines with dual-mapping and otherwise non-compliant engines – should be made available for testing. It should be then up to the PEMS manufacturers to practically demonstrate how these non-compliant vehicles can be identified using their system.

==Testing volume and safe repeatability==

In order to achieve the required amount of 'testing volume' needed to validate real-world testing, three points must be considered:
#System accuracy
#Federal and/or state health and safety guidelines and/or standards
#Economic viability based on the first two points.

Once a particular portable emissions system has been identified and pronounced as accurate, the next step is to ensure that the worker(s) are properly protected from work hazards associated with the task(s) being performed in the use of the testing equipment.  For example, typical functions for a worker may be to transport the equipment to the jobsite (i.e. car, truck, train, or plane), carry the equipment to the jobsite, and lift the equipment into position.

==Advantages of PEMS==

On-road vehicle emissions testing is very different from the laboratory testing, bringing both considerable benefits and challenges: As the testing can take place during the regular operation of the tested vehicles, a large number of vehicles can be tested within a relatively short period of time and at relatively low cost. Engines than cannot be easily tested otherwise (i.e., [[ferry boat]] propulsion engines) can be tested. True real-world emissions data can be obtained. The instruments have to be small, lightweight, withstand difficult environment, and must not pose a safety hazard. Emissions data is subject to considerable variances, as real-world conditions are often neither well defined nor repeatable, and significant variances in emissions can exist even among otherwise identical engines.

Emissions data is subject to considerable variances, as real-world conditions are often neither well defined nor repeatable, and significant variances in emissions can exist even among otherwise identical engines.
On-road emissions testing therefore requires a different mindset than the traditional approach of testing in the laboratory and using models to predict real-world performance. In the absence of established methods, use of PEMS requires careful, thoughtful, broad approach. This should be considered when designing, evaluating and selecting PEMS for the desired application.

A recent example of PEMS advantages over laboratory testing is the [[Volkswagen emissions scandal|Volkswagen (VW) Scandal of 2015]].  Under a small grant from the [http://www.theicct.org International Council for Clean Transportation] Dan Carder and Arvind Thiruvengadam of [http://www.wvu.edu West Virginia University] (WVU) uncovered on-board software "cheats" that VW had installed on some diesel passenger vehicles ([[Dieselgate]] scandal).  The only way the discovery could have been made was by a non-programmed, random, on-road evaluation - utilizing a PEMS device.  VW is now liable for over 14 billion USD in fines.  In 2016, these latest developments led to a global resurgence of interest in smaller, lighter, integrated and cost-effective "non-1065" PEMS, similar to the demonstration on the [http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/bikes-and-bullets/ Mythbusters 2011 Premiere Episode of "Bikes and Bazookas"], in which a non-1065 PEMS was used to establish the difference between car and motorcycle pollution.

==Subcategory: integrated PEMS (iPEMS)==
[[File:3DATX iPEMS Unit.jpg|thumb|upright|Next generation "integrated' PEMS equipment]]


'''Overiew of integrated PEMS (iPEMS) development'''

In response to [[Dieselgate]], the "[[Real Driving Emissions]]" (RDE) standard has been developed in the European Union (EU) which has, in turn, increased the demand for smaller, lighter, more portable, less expensive and integrated PEMS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=David|title=President|url=https://real-driving-emissions.iqpc.de/sponsors/3datx-corporation|website=www.3DATX.com|publisher=Automotive IQ - Real Driving Emissions|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; equipment kits. It should be noted that iPEMS equipment is not presently able to be used as a "certification" device in the U.S.  


'''Definition of iPEMS'''

The following features are common to the smaller and lighter class of iPEMS equipment:  

# A complete, self-contained, and internally modular Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) kit  
# including a built-in, on-board power source,
# no more than 7kg in total weight (including carrying case, exhaust connectors, and any additional equipment required for use), 
# able to be carried by one (1) person, 
# which can be transported through an airport terminal and stored in the overhead bin of an airplane;
# once deployed at a field site, the iPEMS has the ability to be testing vehicles within 30 minutes (assuming that the required onboard power pack has been charged);
# the length of testing time capability from the integrated power pack is a minimum of two (2) hours;
# minimum pollutant testing capabilities must include: Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), and either Particulate Matter (PM) or Particulate Number (PN); 
# testing accuracy must be within 10% (or better) of a 1065 PEMS.


'''Advantages of iPEMS over 1065 PEMS equipment''' 

The advantage of iPEMS equipment is that they are designed to both complement 1065 PEMS in addition to providing expanded capabilities, which are being driven by the requirements for quicker decision-making compounded by the 2015 Volkswagen scandal.  These devices are presently being pursued by both the European Union (EU) and China for their RDE Programs.

Roughs Tower is a disused [[Maunsell Sea Forts|Maunsell Sea Fort]], originally called HM Fort Roughs, built as an anti-aircraft gun platform by the British during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="sealandgov.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sealandgov.org/about |title=History of Sealand |publisher=The Principality of Sealand |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001184858/http://www.sealandgov.org/about |archive-date=1 October 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/all-hail-sealand/ |title=All Hail Sealand |date=20 March 2012 |work=The New York Times |first=Frank |last=Jacobs |access-date=4 April 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BWB8fp1L?url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/all-hail-sealand/ |archive-date=19 October 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===HM Fort Roughs===
{{Main article|HM Fort Roughs}}
In 1943, during [[World War II]], HM Fort Roughs (sometimes called Roughs Tower) was constructed by the United Kingdom as one of the [[Maunsell Forts]],&lt;ref name="seaswaterways"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zumerchik |first=John |title=Seas and Waterways of the World: An Encyclopedia of History, Uses, and Issues |year=2008 |publisher=ABC-CLIO Ltd |isbn=978-1-85109-711-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBKoUXrF5p0C&amp;pg=PA563 |page=563}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily to defend the vital [[shipping lane]]s in nearby [[estuaries]] against Nazi [[Kriegsmarine]] mine-laying aircraft. It consisted of a floating [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon]] base with a superstructure of two hollow towers joined by a deck upon which other structures could be added. The fort was towed to a position above the Rough Sands [[sandbar]], where its base was deliberately flooded to sink it on its final resting place. This is approximately {{convert|7|nmi|km|0}} from the coast of [[Suffolk]], outside the then [[three-mile limit|{{convert|3|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} claim]] of the United Kingdom and, therefore, in [[international waters]].&lt;ref name="seaswaterways"/&gt; The facility was occupied by 150–300 [[Royal Navy]] personnel throughout World War II; the last full-time personnel left in 1956.&lt;ref name="seaswaterways"/&gt;

===Occupation and establishment===
[[File:Sealand Passport Stamp.png|thumb|Passport stamp from Sealand]]
Roughs Tower was occupied in February and August 1965 by Jack Moore and his daughter Jane, squatting on behalf of the pirate station [[Wonderful Radio London]].

On 2 September 1967, the fort was occupied by Major [[Paddy Roy Bates]], a British subject and pirate radio broadcaster, who ejected a competing group of pirate broadcasters.&lt;ref name="Micronations"&gt;{{cite book |title=Micronations |first1=John |last1=Ryan |first2=George |last2=Dunford |first3=Simon |last3=Sellars |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2006 |isbn=1-74104-730-7 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates intended to broadcast his pirate radio station&amp;nbsp;– called Radio Essex&amp;nbsp;– from the platform.&lt;ref name="Gould1966"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gould |first=Jack |date=25 March 1966 |title=Radio: British Commercial Broadcasters Are at Sea; Illegal {{not a typo|Programs}} Are Beamed From Ships |work=The New York Times |access-date=19 December 2015 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E06E6DC1E39E735A75756C2A9659C946791D6CF |subscription=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222170906/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E06E6DC1E39E735A75756C2A9659C946791D6CF |archive-date=22 December 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having the necessary equipment, he never began broadcasting.&lt;ref name="Essex"&gt;Edwards, Chris; Parkes, James (19 October 2000).

Off Shore Echoes. Retrieved 11 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Bates declared the independence of Roughs Tower and deemed it the Principality of Sealand.&lt;ref name="Micronations"/&gt;

In 1968, British workmen entered what Bates claimed to be his [[territorial waters]] to service a navigational buoy near the platform. Michael Bates (son of Paddy Roy Bates) tried to scare the workmen off by firing warning shots from the former fort. As Bates was a [[British subject]] at the time, he was summoned to court in England on firearms charges following the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Welcome to Sealand.

In 1975, Bates introduced a constitution for Sealand, followed by a [[national flag]], a [[national anthem]], a currency and [[passports]].&lt;ref name="sealandgov.org"/&gt;

====Attack in 1978 and the Sealand Rebel Government====
In August 1978, Alexander Achenbach, who describes himself as the Prime Minister of Sealand, hired several German and Dutch [[mercenary|mercenaries]] to spearhead an attack on Sealand while Bates and his wife were in England.&lt;ref name=LP11&gt;{{cite book |title=Micronations |first1=John |last1=Ryan |first2=George |last2=Dunford |first3=Simon |last3=Sellars |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2006 |isbn=1-74104-730-7 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stormed the platform with [[speedboats]], [[Jet Ski]]s and [[helicopters]], and took Bates's son Michael hostage. Michael was able to retake Sealand and capture Achenbach and the mercenaries using weapons stashed on the platform. Achenbach, a German lawyer who held a Sealand passport, was charged with [[treason]] against Sealand&lt;ref name="LP11"/&gt; and was held unless he paid [[German mark|DM]]&amp;nbsp;75,000 (more than US$35,000 or £23,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Attempt to free captive from private 'island' fails |date=5 September 1978 |page=3 |work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of the Netherlands, Austria and Germany petitioned the British government for his release, but the United Kingdom disavowed his imprisonment, citing the 1968 court decision.&lt;ref name="sealandgov.org"/&gt; Germany then sent a diplomat from its London embassy to Sealand to negotiate for Achenbach's release. Roy Bates relented after several weeks of negotiations and subsequently claimed that the diplomat's visit constituted ''de facto'' recognition of Sealand by Germany.&lt;ref name="LP11"/&gt;

Following the former's repatriation, Achenbach and Gernot Pütz established a [[government in exile]], sometimes known as the Sealand Rebel Government or Sealandic Rebel Government, in Germany.&lt;ref name="LP11"/&gt; Achenbach's appointed successor, Johannes Seiger, continues to claim via his website that he is Sealand's legitimate ruling authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://principality-of-sealand.eu/welcome_e.html |title=Homepage of Sealandic Government in Exile |accessdate=13 November 2007 |publisher=Sealandic Government in Exile }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Since 1990 ===
[[File:Sealandafterfire2.JPG|thumb|Sealand several months after the devastating fire of 2006]]
In 1997, the Bates family revoked all Sealand passports, including those that they themselves had issued over the previous 22 years.&lt;ref name="LP11"/&gt; There were thought to have been about 150,000 in circulation.&lt;ref name="sealandgov.org"/&gt; 

On the afternoon of 23 June 2006, the top platform of the Roughs Tower caught fire due to an electrical fault. A [[Royal Air Force]] rescue helicopter transferred one person to Ipswich hospital, directly from the tower. The [[Harwich]] [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] stood by the Roughs Tower until a local fire tug extinguished the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5110244.stm |title=Blaze at offshore military fort |publisher=BBC |date=23 June 2006 |accessdate=15 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530054922/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5110244.stm |archive-date=30 May 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All damage was repaired by November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchandeast.co.uk/Sealand%20update%204.html |title=Church and East renovation completion |archive-date=4 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304151403/http://www.churchandeast.co.uk/Sealand%20update%204.html |dead-url=yes |publisher=Church and East |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, [[The Pirate Bay]] attempted to purchase Sealand after harsher [[copyright]] measures in Sweden forced them to look for a base of operations elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Graham |first=Flora |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7893223.stm |title=Technology: How The Pirate Bay sailed into infamy |publisher=BBC News |date=16 February 2009 |accessdate=9 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419012716/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7893223.stm |archive-date=19 April 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2007 and 2010, Sealand was offered for sale through the Spanish estate company InmoNaranja,&lt;ref name="bbc_sealand"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiny North Sea tax haven for sale |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1823039.htm |publisher=[[ABC Online|ABC News]] |date=8 January 2007 |location=Sydney, Australia |agency=Agence France-Presse |archive-date=24 March 2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324010702/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1823039.htm |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at an asking price of €750&amp;nbsp;million ([[GBP|£]]600&amp;nbsp;million, US$906&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name="bbc_sealand"&gt;{{cite news |title='Smallest state' seeks new owners |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6239967.stm |publisher=BBC |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=8 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110081146/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6239967.stm |archive-date=10 January 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=£65m price tag for Sealand tenancy |url= http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/news/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=ESTOnline&amp;tCategory=News&amp;itemid=IPED06%20Jan%202007%2006%3A41%3A18%3A723 |work=Evening Star |location=Ipswich |date=6 January 2007 |accessdate=6 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111222049/http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/news/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=ESTOnline&amp;tCategory=News&amp;itemid=IPED06%20Jan%202007%2006%3A41%3A18%3A723 |archivedate=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For sale, World's smallest country |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/for-sale-worlds-smallest-country/2007/01/08/1168104905597.html |work=The [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=8 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224164904/http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/for-sale-worlds-smallest-country/2007/01/08/1168104905597.html |archive-date=24 February 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
The claim that Sealand is an independent sovereign state is based on an interpretation of a 1968 decision of an English court, in which it was held that Roughs Tower was in international waters and thus outside the jurisdiction of the domestic courts.&lt;ref name="sealandgov.org"/&gt;

[[File:Map of Sealand with territorial waters.svg|thumb|255px|Map of Sealand and the United Kingdom, with territorial water claims of {{convert|3|and|12|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} shown.]]
In [[international law]], the most common schools of thought for the creation of statehood are the [[constitutive theory of statehood|constitutive]] and [[declarative theory of statehood|declaratory]] theories of state creation. The constitutive theory is the standard nineteenth-century model of statehood, and the declaratory theory was developed in the twentieth century to address shortcomings of the constitutive theory. In the constitutive theory, a state exists exclusively via recognition by other states. The theory splits on whether this recognition requires 'diplomatic recognition' or merely 'recognition of existence'. No other state grants Sealand official recognition, but it has been argued by Bates that negotiations carried out by Germany following a brief [[Principality of Sealand#Attack in 1978 and the Sealand Rebel Government|hostage incident]] constituted 'recognition of existence' (and, since the German government reportedly sent an ambassador to the tower, diplomatic recognition). In the declaratory theory of statehood, an entity becomes a state as soon as it meets the minimal criteria for statehood. Therefore, recognition by other states is purely 'declaratory'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ryan |first=John |author2=George Dunford |author3=Simon Sellars |title=Micronations, The Lonely Planet Guide to Home-Made Nations |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2006 |pages=5–6 |isbn=1-74104-730-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have no territorial sea of their own, and their presence does not affect the delimitation of the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf'.&lt;ref name=UN_conv/&gt; In the opinion of law academic John Gibson, there is little chance that Sealand would be recognised as a nation because it is a man-made structure.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;

In a [[Radio Newyork International#Court_cases|1990 court case]] (and a 1991 appeal) in the United States regarding registering ships in Sealand as a [[flag of convenience]], the court ruled against allowing Sealand flagged vessels; the case was never contested by the Bateses.

Irrespective of its legal status, Sealand is managed by the Bates family as if it were a recognised sovereign entity and they are its hereditary [[royal family|royal]] rulers.

==Business operations==
Sealand has been involved in several commercial operations, including the issuing of coins and postage stamps and the establishment of an offshore Internet hosting facility, or '[[data haven]]'.&lt;ref name="Economist2001"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.economist.com/node/471742 |title=Stop signs on the web; The battle between freedom and regulation on the Internet |work=The Economist |date=13 January 2001 |page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106220031/http://www.economist.com/node/471742 |archive-date=6 November 2015 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann2012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Grimmelmann |first=James |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/sealand-and-havenco/ |title=Death of a data haven: cypherpunks, WikiLeaks, and the world’s smallest nation |date=27 March 2012 |work=Ars Technica |dead-url=no |archive-date=18 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018022757/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/sealand-and-havenco/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sealand also has an official website and publishes an online newspaper, ''Sealand News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sealandnews.com |title=Sealand News |accessdate=11 November 2007 |work=Sealand News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110013151/http://www.sealandnews.com/ |archivedate=10 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a number of amateur athletes 'represent' Sealand in sporting events, including unconventional events like the [[World Egg Throwing Federation|World Egg Throwing Championship]], which the Sealand team won in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sealand wins sporting accolade |url=http://www.sealandnews.com/sealand-wins-sporting-accolade_207.html |publisher=Sealand News |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=30 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727232041/http://www.sealandnews.com/sealand-wins-sporting-accolade_207.html |archivedate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coins and stamps===
{{Main article|Coins and postage stamps of Sealand}}
[[File:Sealand Coins Flag.jpg|250px|thumb|Sealandic coins, from left to right: half dollar, silver one dollar and quarter dollar]]
Several dozen different Sealand coins have been minted since 1972. In the early 1990s, Achenbach's German group also produced a coin, featuring a likeness of 'Prime Minister Seiger'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imperial-collection.net/sealand03.html |title=The Imperial Collection&amp;nbsp;– Principality of Sealand |publisher=Empire of Atlantium |accessdate=11 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102083747/http://www.imperial-collection.net/sealand03.html |archivedate=2 November 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sealand's coins and postage stamps are denominated in 'Sealand dollars', which it deems to be at [[purchasing power parity|parity]] with the US dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sealandgov.org/About.html |title=Principality of Sealand |publisher=Government of the Principality of Sealand |accessdate=17 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704190134/http://www.sealandgov.org/About.html |archivedate=4 July 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sealand first issued postage stamps in 1969, and issues through 1977. No further stamps were produced until 2010. Sealand is not a member of the [[Universal Postal Union]], therefore its inward address is a [[PO Box]] in the British borough of [[Ipswich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/addressfinder;jsessionid=I1BCVKJXHDFL0FB2IGEUQEQUHRAYOQ2K?catId=400145&amp;pageId=pcaf_a_one_result_rm&amp;_requestid=116508&amp;gear=postcode |title=Royal Mail address for Sealand |work=Royal Mail |accessdate=10 November 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once an item is mailed to Sealand's tourist and government office, it will then be taken to Sealand.

===Titles of nobility ===
Sealand also sells titles of individual nobility including [[Lord]], [[Baron]], [[Count]] and those titles' distaff equivalents. Following Roy Bates's 2012 death, Sealand also began publicly offering [[knighthoods]] &amp; Coats of Arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-20831502|title=Ed Sheeran given title of 'baron'|date=23 December 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=23 January 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516035144/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-20831502|archive-date=16 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sealandgov.org/shop/titles-ids/become-a-count-or-countess/|title=Become a Count or Countess|publisher=Government of Principality of Sealand|accessdate=27 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126172112/http://www.sealandgov.org/shop/titles-ids/become-a-count-or-countess/|archive-date=26 January 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, following the invasion, the Knights of the Sovereign Military Order of Sealand were formed by Prince Roy and Prince Michael to provide for the Principality's defence should it come under threat or attack. In 2012, following the death of Prince Roy, membership in the Order was opened to sale to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Join the Knights of the Sovereign Military Order of Sealand|url=http://www.sealandgov.org/shop/titles-ids/join-the-knights-of-the-sovereign-military-order-of-sealand/|website=Sealand|publisher=Government of the Principality of Sealand|accessdate=27 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123175211/http://www.sealandgov.org/shop/titles-ids/join-the-knights-of-the-sovereign-military-order-of-sealand/|archive-date=23 January 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HavenCo===
{{Main article|HavenCo}}
In 2000, worldwide publicity was created about Sealand following the establishment of a new entity called HavenCo, a [[data haven]], which effectively took control of Roughs Tower itself; however, [[Ryan Lackey]], HavenCo's founder, later quit and claimed that Bates had lied to him by keeping the 1990–1991 court case{{clarify|date=October 2012}} from him and that, as a result, he had lost the money he had invested in the venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sealand, Havenco, and the Rule of Law |last=Grimmelmann |first=James |year=2012 |publisher=University of Illinois Law Review |accessdate=14 June 2012 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/87058288/Grimmelmann-Havenco-Sealand |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902111842/http://www.scribd.com/doc/87058288/Grimmelmann-Havenco-Sealand |archive-date=2 September 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, operations of HavenCo ceased without explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://securityandthe.net/2008/11/18/havenco-data-center-offline/ HavenCo "data center" offline?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122174805/http://securityandthe.net/2008/11/18/havenco-data-center-offline/ |date=22 January 2009 }}, Security and the Net, 18 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
Sealand is not recognised by any major international sporting body, and its population is insufficient to maintain a team composed entirely of Sealanders in any team sport. However, Sealand claims to have official national [[sportsperson|athletes]], including non-Sealanders. These athletes take part in various sports, such as [[curling]], [[Miniature golf|mini-golf]], [[Association football|football]], [[fencing]], [[ultimate frisbee|ultimate]], [[Subbuteo|table football]] and [[Sport of athletics|athletics]], although all its teams compete out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sealandfootball.dk/index.asp |title=Homepage of the Sealand National Football Team |accessdate=9 November 2007 |publisher=Sealand National Football Team |language=Danish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030175312/http://www.sealandfootball.dk/index.asp# |archive-date=30 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sealand National Football Association]] is an associate member of the [[Nouvelle Fédération-Board]], a football sanctioning body for non-recognised states and states not members of [[FIFA]].

A '''radial tire''' (more properly, a '''radial-ply tire''') is a particular design of vehicular [[tire]].  In this design, the cord [[Tire#Ply|plies]] are arranged at 90 degrees to the direction of travel, or radially (from the center of the tire). Radial tire construction climbed to 100% market share in North America, following [[Consumer Reports]] finding the superiority of the radial design in 1968.&lt;ref name="jags.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jags.org/TechInfo/2001/05May01/tires/historyoftires.htm|title=History|website=www.jags.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Tale of Two Tires"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-05-04/a-tale-of-two-tiresbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|work=Bloomberg|title=A Tale of Two Tires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first radial tire designs were patented in 1915 by [[Arthur William Savage#San Diego, CA, Savage Tire|Arthur W. Savage]], a tire manufacturer (1915–1919), and inventor in [[San Diego, CA]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 1203910, May 21, 1915, Vehicle Tire, Inventor Arthur W. Savage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forgottenweapons.com/biographies/arthur-w-savage/ Forgottenweapons.com Arthur W. Savage] Retrieved July 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Savage's patents expired in 1949.

[[Michelin]] in [[France]] designed, developed, patented, and commercialized the radial tire.&lt;ref name="Kraus"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://autouniversum.wordpress.com/2011/03/07/michelin-and-the-birth-of-the-radial-tire/ |title=Michelin and the birth of the radial tire |publisher= Autouniversum |author=James Kraus |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that Michelin had knowledge of Arthur Savage's earlier work. The first Michelin X radial tire for cars was developed in 1946 by Michelin researcher Marius Mignol.&lt;ref name="Kraus"/&gt; Michelin owned the leading automaker [[Citroën]], so it was quickly able to introduce its new design, including on the new 1948 [[Citroën 2CV]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Giles [https://books.google.com/books?id=KDrsOwZnK1QC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=1948+citroen+2cv+tires&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VU0gjYa2L1&amp;sig=rEJ__TIVPEpQNw0irUQ7ih_W4LE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCDgKahUKEwjXvZXDuPnGAhXUXIgKHfEXAaM#v=onepage&amp;q=1948%20citroen%202cv%20tires&amp;f=false Illustrated Encyclopedia of Extraordinary Automobiles] page 104 {{ISBN|978-0756695767}} April 16, 2012 Retrieved July 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, Michelin developed a radial truck tire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialmotor.com/big-lorry-blog/let-s-get-rolling---michelin-celebrates-the-60th-anniversay-of-radial-tyres-on-biglorryblog|title=Big Lorry Blog Archives - Truckanddriver.co.uk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its significant advantages in durability and fuel economy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michelinag.com/Innovating/Radial-vs.-Bias-technology|title=Michelin Agricultural Tires|first=|last=Michelin|website=www.michelinag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; this technology spread quickly in Europe and Asia in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="Kraus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tedlow, Richard S.

In 1968, [[Consumer Reports]], an influential American magazine, acknowledged the superiority of the radial tire design, documenting its longer tread life, better steering characteristics, and less rolling resistance, which increases [[Fuel economy in automobiles|gas mileage]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Consumer Reports, "Tires," Consumer Reports, (August 1968): 404-409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welch, David [https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-05-04/a-tale-of-two-tiresbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] A Tale of Two Tires] May 4, 2006 Retrieved July 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, [[Ford Motor Company]] produced the first [[American automobile industry in the 1950s#Tires|American-made]] vehicle with radial tires as standard equipment, [[Michelin]] tires fitted to the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Daniel [http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z10204/Lincoln-Continental.aspx Conceptcarz.com 1969 Lincoln Continental news, pictures, specifications, and information] September 2008 Retrieved July 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Charles J. Pilliod, Jr.]], the new [[CEO]] of [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company#Radial tire transition|Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]], faced a major investment decision regarding retooling for the radial tire, following the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Despite heavy criticism at the time, Pilliod invested heavily in new factories and tooling to build the radial tire.&lt;ref name="WSJ050116"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/charles-pilliod-kept-goodyear-out-of-rivals-hands-1918-2016-1461922202| title=Charles Pilliod Kept Goodyear Out of Rivals’ Hands: 1918-2016 World War II bomber pilot led tire maker when it was besieged by Japanese and European competitors |publisher=Wall Street Journal |page=A6 |date=1 May 2016| accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, only Goodyear, Cooper, Titan and Specialty Tires of America remain independent among US tire manufacturers, and the radial has a market share of 100%.&lt;ref name="jags.org"/&gt; Sam Gibara, who headed Goodyear from 1996 to 2003, has noted that without the action of Pilliod, Goodyear "wouldn't be around today." &lt;ref name="WSJ050116"/&gt;

In 1974, [[Leopoldo Pirelli]] created the ''wide radial tire'' in [[Italy]], upon a request from the [[Lancia]] rally racing team for a tire sufficiently strong enough to withstand the power of the new [[Lancia Stratos]]. At that time, racing tires were either slick tires made with the cross ply technique (very wide tires with a reduced sidewall height), or radial tires, which were too narrow to withstand the Stratos' power and did not provide enough grip. Both were unusable for the Lancia Stratos, as the radials were destroyed within 10&amp;nbsp;km, and the slicks too stiff. Lancia asked Pirelli for a solution, and in the succeeding year Pirelli also made a wide tire with a reduced sidewall height like a slick, but with a radial structure.

Radial technology is now the standard design for essentially all automotive tires.&lt;ref name="jags.org"/&gt;

Bias tires are still used on [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] due to their weight carrying ability and resistance to swaying when towed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westmarine.com/WestAdvisor/Trailer-Tire-Basics|title=Trailer Tire Basics - West Marine|website=www.westmarine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For aircraft, the transition is happening more slowly - tires are [[Certification|certified]] along with the [[airframe]]. A radial has less material in the sidewall, so it weighs less, runs cooler and lasts longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/am/issue/productfocus/Aircraft-Tires_24839.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817032142/http://www.aviationtoday.com/am/issue/productfocus/Aircraft-Tires_24839.html |archivedate=2016-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For smaller planes, bias tires afford more stability at higher speeds and have stronger sidewalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunlopaircrafttyres.com/tech_support/aircraft-tyre-technology.aspx|title=Dunlop Aircraft Tyres - Manufacturer and Retreader of Aircraft Tires|website=www.dunlopaircrafttyres.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
A series of plies of [[rope|cord]] reinforces a tire. Without this, a tire would be flexible and weak. The network of cords that gives the tire strength and shape is called the carcass. Since the 1960s, all common tires have a carcass of cords of polyester, steel, or other textile materials, inlaid with several layers of rubber.

In the past, the fabric was built up on a flat steel drum, with the cords at angles of about +60 and −60 degrees from the direction of travel, so they criss-crossed over each other. They were called [[cross ply]] or bias ply tires. The plies were turned up around the steel wire beads and the combined tread/sidewall applied. The green (uncured) tire was loaded over a curing bladder and shaped into the mold. This shaping process caused the cords in the tire to assume an S-shape from bead to bead. The angle under the tread, the crown angle, stretched down to about 36 degrees. In the sidewall region the angle was 45 degrees, and in the bead it remained at 60 degrees. The low crown angle gave rigidity to support the tread and the high sidewall angle gave comfort. To increase strength, the manufacturer would increase the number of plies, and the [[Heat transfer|heat buildup in the tire]].&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, James [https://autouniversum.wordpress.com/2011/03/07/michelin-and-the-birth-of-the-radial-tire/ Autouniversum.wordpress.com Michelin and the birth of the radial tire] March 7, 2011 Retrieved July 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, radial tires lay all of the cord plies at 90 degrees to the direction of travel (that is, across the tire from lip to lip). This design avoids having the plies rub against each other as the tire flexes, reducing the tire's rolling friction. This allows vehicles with radial tires to achieve better [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] than with bias-ply tires. It also accounts for the slightly "low on air" (bulging) look that radial tire sidewalls have, especially when compared to bias-ply tires.

With only radial cords, a radial tire would not be sufficiently rigid at the contact with the ground. To add further stiffness, the entire tire is surrounded by additional belts oriented closer to the direction of travel, but usually at some "spiral" angle. These belts can be made of steel (hence the term steel-belted radial), [[polyester]], or [[Aramid]] fibers such as [[Twaron]] or [[Kevlar]].

In this way, low radial tires separate the tire carcass into two separate systems:
* The radial cords in the sidewall allow it to act like a spring, giving flexibility and ride comfort.
* The rigid steel belts reinforce the tread region, giving high mileage and performance.

Each system can then be individually optimized for best performance.

==Application==

Radial tires have different characteristics of springiness from those of [[Tire#Construction_types|bias-ply tires]], and a different degree of slip while steering.  A benefit was that cars could now be made lighter because they would not have to make up for the deficiencies of bias-ply tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moran |first=Tim |title=The Radial Revolution |work=Invention &amp; Technology Magazine |publisher=American Heritage Publishing |date=2001-04-28 |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2001/4/2001_4_28.shtml |accessdate=2008-08-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226064252/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2001/4/2001_4_28.shtml |archivedate=2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, motorists were not accustomed to the feel, hence the suspension systems of cars had to be modified. [[Ford Motor Company]] engineer Jack Bajer experimented in the 1960s on a [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], by giving it less tight steering, and adding both isolators to the drive shaft and bushings to the suspension, the latter being to absorb the thump of riding over asphalt expansion joints in a concrete roadway. 
Radial tires have occasionally found application on bicycles, used on the 1980s Miyata touring bicycle; models 1000 and 610,&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Brown: Japanese cycles in the American market: http://www.sheldonbrown.com/japan.html#miyata&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently in 2009 on the [[Maxxis]] Radiale.&lt;ref&gt;Maxxis Radiale: {{cite web |url=http://www.maxxis.com/Bicycle/Road-Racing/Radiale-22c.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219023255/http://www.maxxis.com/Bicycle/Road-Racing/Radiale-22c.aspx |archivedate=2009-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Panaracer radial tires were also standard on the Jamis Gentry model bicycle in 1985.

The steel wires in radial tires become magnetized with use, so as they rotate, an alternating magnetic field is created. It is quite measurable with an EMF meter close to the wheel well when the wheel is rotating, and is rich in harmonics up to several hundred hertz.[https://prof.hti.bfh.ch/fileadmin/home/mik1/Magnfields_HPJ_revision.pdf]

==Features==

The advantages of radial tires over bias ply :&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* Flexible sidewalls
* Reduced fuel consumption due to less rolling resistance
* A softer ride because of the layout of the tire's plies and because of the flex of the sidewalls more stable contact with the road service.
* Steel Belted – Results in tougher overall construction
* Longer Tread Life
* Wider Footprint
* Less ground compaction and damage
* Reduction in tire replacement due to less heat generated by the tire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agricultural.michelinman.com/us/Properly-use-your-tires/Radial-or-bias-the-right-choice|title=Radial or bias, the right choice / Properly use your tires     - Michelin Agricultural Tires|first=|last=Michelin|website=agricultural.michelinman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rice color sorter.jpg|thumb]]
==Features==
A [[rice]] color sorting machine, also named rice [[colour sorter]], separates rice grains according to color differences in raw rice arising from anomalies like bits of stone, bad rice, black rice, half-husked rice, etc. A high-resolution CCD optical sensor drives a mechanical sorter to separate different granular materials, automatically [[sorting]] heterochromatic particles out of the batch of raw rice; removing such impurities in this process improves the quality of the rice.

==Working principle==
Rice processing begins in a milling plant, where the harvested grains run through a production line where the rice is boiled, dried, de-stoned, husked, hulled and shelled. It then is taken to the color sorter machine. At this point, the rice mixture will travel by elevator belt into a hopper on top of the machine, from which it will flow down along chutes in the colour sorter, streamlining their flow to so that they may be scanned by CCD sensors. The moment the camera detects any color defects, the camera instructs ejectors fitted in the machine to open the nozzle. The nozzle is connected to valves containing compressed air. This air is then used to shoot out the color defected material from the input rice. The types of defects in rice include black tipped, chalky, yellow, mouse droppings, immature grain, etc.

==Working Environment==
# The working environment: normal temperature, normal pressure, aeration-drying, dust-free place. Working temperature: 50–350 °C.
# Air system: [[air compressor]], air tank, air dryer connect color sorter [[solenoid valve]]. Usually working pressure at least is 0.2 MPa.
# Common Voltage: air compressor 380 V, 50 Hz. Color Sorter: 220 V, 50 Hz.

==Model &amp; Brand==
# Photoelectric camera color sorter(technology is too old and went out of market): 160Channel,240Channels, 320Channels.
# CCD color sorter(Latest technology)

[[File:Exhibition Road, segregation 20160312.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Pedestrians and cars on [[Exhibition Road]] in London]]

'''Shared space''' is an [[urban design]] approach that minimises the segregation between modes of road user. This is done by removing features such as [[curb (road)|kerbs]], [[road surface marking]]s, [[traffic sign]]s, and [[traffic light]]s. [[Hans Monderman]] and others have suggested that, by creating a greater [https://www.asla.org/2012awards/572.html sense of uncertainty] and making it unclear who has priority, drivers will reduce their speed, in turn reducing the dominance of vehicles, reducing road casualty rates, and improving safety for other road users.

Shared space design can take many different forms depending on the level of demarcation and segregation between different transportation modes. Variations of shared space are often used in urban settings, especially those that have been made nearly car-free ("autoluwe"), and as part of [[living street]]s within residential areas. As a separate concept, "shared space" normally applies to semi-open spaces on busier roads, and here it is controversial.

Shared space is opposed in particular by organisations representing the interests of [[Blindness|blind]], [[Visual impairment|partially sighted]] and [[Deafness|deaf]] people, who often express a preference for the clear separation of pedestrian and vehicular [[traffic]].

== History ==
The origin of term is generally linked with the work of Dutch traffic engineer [[Hans Monderman]], who pioneered the method in the Dutch province of Friesland.&lt;ref name="uwe"/&gt; Prior to the adoption of the term, street design projects carried out in [[Chambéry]], France, by Michel Deronzier from the 1980s used the term "pedestrian priority".{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The term was used by Tim Pharoah to describe informal street layouts with no traffic demarcation (for example "Traffic Calming Guidelines", Devon County Council, 1991).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The term has been widely applied, especially by [[Ben Hamilton-Baillie]], since the preparation of a European co-operation project in 2003.&lt;ref name="bhb_1"/&gt; The European Shared Space project (part of the Interreg IIIB-North Sea programme) developed new policies and methods for the design of public spaces with streets between 2004 and 2008 under the leadership of Hans Monderman until his death in 2008.&lt;ref name="shared-space"&gt;{{cite web |title=Shared Space |publisher=Shared Space Institute |url=http://www.sharedspace.eu/en/publications/downloads/cat_view/15-boeken-en-brochures/17-eigen-uitgaven/ |quote=Booklets published by the EU partnership.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the evolution of the shared space concepts (2014) is offered in [[Transport Reviews]]: A Transnational Transdisciplinary Journal.&lt;ref name="transport reviews"&gt;{{cite web

The [[Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation]] has identified three broad types of street design approach that have been called shared space but which have a number of important differences. They suggest that the term "shared space" should be replaced by three new labels: pedestrian prioritised streets, informal streets and enhanced streets.&lt;ref&gt;Creating better streets: Inclusive and accessible places.

[[Hans Monderman]] suggested that an individual's behavior in traffic is more positively affected by the [[built environment]] of the public space than by conventional [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals|traffic control devices]] and [[Traffic#Rules of the road|regulations]].&lt;ref name="bhb_1"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Shared Space? |author=Ben Hamilton-Baillie |url=http://www.hamilton-baillie.co.uk/_files/_publications/6-1.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214145233/http://www.hamilton-baillie.co.uk/_files/_publications/6-1.pdf |archivedate=14 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UK traffic engineers lack skills for shared-space |author=Damian Arnold |date=2007-11-15 |publisher=New Civil Engineer |url=http://www.nce.co.uk/news/uk_traffic_engineers_lack_skills_for_sharedspace.html |accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="room"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shared Space: Room for Everyone: A New Vision for Public Spaces|url=http://www.eukn.org/dsresource?objectid=146375|publisher=Shared Space (A European co-operation project)|date=June 2005|format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A reason for the apparent paradox that reduced regulation leads to safer roads may be found by studying the [[risk compensation]] effect.&lt;ref name="room"/&gt;

Such schemes are claimed to have had positive effect on road safety, traffic volume, economic vitality, and community cohesion where a user's behaviour becomes influenced and controlled by natural human interactions rather than by artificial regulation.&lt;ref name="shared-space"/&gt; Monderman has stated that objections are more a matter of communication than design, stressing the importance of consulting all relevant groups during the design stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The UK's [[Department for Transport]] issued national guidance on shared space in 2011.&lt;ref name="dft" /&gt; However in July 2018 it reversed its position and instructed local authorities to halt all new shared space projects, with Transport Minister Nusrat Ghani stating they "just don't work" for blind and partially-sighted people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-44971392&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Reviewing the research that underpinned national policy in the UK,&lt;ref name="dft"/&gt; Moody and Melia (2011) found that some of the claims made for shared space schemes were not justified by the evidence—particularly the claims that pedestrians are able to follow [[desire line]]s, and that shared space reduces traffic speeds.&lt;ref name="uwe"/&gt; Their primary research in Ashford, Kent, suggested that in streets with high volumes of traffic, pedestrians are more likely to give way to vehicles than vice versa. Most people, but particularly women and older people, found the shared space intimidating and preferred the previous layout with conventional crossings. A study by Hammond and Musselwhite&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, V. and Musselwhite, C B A (2013). The attitudes, perceptions and concerns of pedestrians and vulnerable road users to shared space: a case study from the UK. Journal of Urban Design 18(1),[https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa14532] H 78-97.&lt;/ref&gt; using a case study of Widemarsh Street in Hereford found that if traffic volume was relatively low and speeds of vehicles slow anyway then vulnerable road users found it easier to share the area with vehicles, including those blind or partially sighted and older people with mobility impairments.

There are wide-ranging reservations about the practicality of the shared space philosophy. In a 2006 report from the [[Associated Press]], it was commented that traditionalists in [[town planning]] departments say the schemes rob the motorists of vital information, and reported that a spokesman for [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]] criticised the removal of familiar features such as railings, kerbs, and barriers.&lt;ref name="ap_20061121"&gt;{{cite news |title=In Europe, less is more when it comes to road signs |agency=Associated Press |work=International Herald Tribune |date=21 November 2006 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/21/europe/EU_GEN_Britain_Naked_Roads.php |accessdate=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shared space is opposed by many organisations representing blind, partially sighted and deaf people. Some of their members avoid shared space areas entirely. ''Shared surfaces'', which are generally used in shared space schemes, can cause concern for the blind and partially sighted who cannot visually negotiate their way with other road users, as the lack of separation implicit in these features has also removed their safe space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What's the Problem |author=Guide Dogs for the Blind Association |accessdate=4 December 2010 |url=http://www.guidedogs.org.uk/sharedstreets/index.php?id=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's [[Guide Dogs for the Blind Association]]s "Say No to Shared Streets" campaign has the support of more than thirty other disability organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Shared street' problem for blind |date=20 May 2009 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8058604.stm |accessdate=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been similar concerns raised by other groups representing disabled people, including [[Leonard Cheshire Disability]], the [[Royal National Institute for Deaf People]], and [[Mencap]], who have noted problems when negotiating a route with motor vehicle users, leading them to challenge its fundamental premise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shared Surfaces Campaign Report - "Stop shared surfaces, keep our pavements" |author=Guide Dogs for the Blind Association |accessdate=27 September 2008 |format=pdf |url=http://www.guidedogs.org.uk/uploads/media/Shared_Surfaces_Campaign_Report_01.pdf}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Holmes' 2015 report ''Accidents by Design'' found that sixty-three per cent of respondents reported a negative experience of shared space, and thirty-five per cent said they actively avoided it. Lord Holmes attacked the concept as a recipe for "confusion, chaos and catastrophe".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accidents by Design: The Holmes Report into Shared Space - Lord Holmes of Richmond MBE|url = http://chrisholmes.co.uk/news/accidents-by-design-the-holmes-report-into-shared-space/|website = Lord Holmes of Richmond MBE|accessdate = 2015-10-17|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Holmes report also noted serious issues for wheelchair users "Respondents who used wheelchairs stated that it was virtually impossible to locate a safe crossing point on roads with shared space."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transportforall.org.uk/about/news/new-report-calls-for-a-moratorium-on-shared-space-schemes&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, the UK DfT reversed its position on shared spaces due to the risk to disabled people, with Transport Minister Nusrat Ghani stating "they just don't work". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-44971392&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Dutch ''Fietsberaad'' (Centre of Expertise on Bicycle Policy) has demonstrated ambivalence over shared space schemes, describing some benefits but also some drawbacks for the less assertive cyclist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fietsberaad.nl/views/voorbeeldenbank/detail_modal.cfm?lang=en&amp;section=voorbeeldenbank&amp;mode=openModal&amp;repository=Shared-space-intersection+De+Kaden Shared-space-intersection De Kaden]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fietsberaad'' has noted that shared space has decreased car speeds but that "some cyclists do not dare take priority. Instead, they dismount and wait for priority to be clearly given, then walk or ride across the intersection. A problem may be that they are met halfway by cars from the other direction and must rely on the drivers to give way of their own volition. Owing to low speeds and the cyclists' defensive behaviour this crossing strategy need not be unsafe in itself, but it most certainly is not convenient."

In New Zealand, concerns about such limitations of the shared space concept have led, in cooperation with disability organisations, to the introduction of vehicle- and obstruction-free corridors ("accessible zones") along the building lines (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;in the areas where footpaths would normally be located), to provide a safe route in the shared spaces being introduced.&lt;ref name=ACCESS&gt;{{cite web|title=Elliot Street - Accessibility|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/elliottdarby/designs.asp|publisher=[[Auckland City Council]]|accessdate=3 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118062223/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/elliottdarby/designs.asp|archivedate=18 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, [[Graz]] opened a shared space zone around a five-point intersection known as Sonnenfelsplatz next to the [[University of Graz]] with the intention of easing congestion from 4 separate city bus lines and auto, bike and pedestrian traffic as well as reducing the number of accidents.  This was the first shared space concept for Austria.&lt;ref&gt;

There is a traffic sign at the entrance to the town that reads ''Verkeersbordvrij'', meaning "free of traffic signs". Parking meters and stopping restrictions are also absent.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; [[Drachten]] is another pioneer town for such schemes. Accident figures at one junction where traffic lights were removed have dropped from thirty-six in the four years prior to the introduction of the scheme to two in the two years following it.

The concept of a shared space where no right of way is defined for all participants is presently not legally possible. The Strassenverkehrsgesetz (SVG) requires that at least one of the participants has a right of way. As a result, the Swiss concept of ''Begegnungszone'' has become popular. However here pedestrians have right of way.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19580266/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is reported that, based on two years of 'before and after' monitoring, casualties fell from 71 in the period before the street was remodelled to 40 afterwards{{spaced ndash}}a drop of 43%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Life on the open road |work=The Guardian |date=12 April 2006  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/apr/12/communities.guardiansocietysupplement | location=London | first=Mark | last=Gould | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gwynedd Council rebuilt the foreground to [[Caernarfon Castle]]. The scheme uses local slate and granite surfacing and high-quality street furniture, and a new fountain, intended to create a change in the behaviour of drivers.

Brighton City Council transformed the whole of New Road, adjacent to the Royal Pavilion, into a fully shared space designed by Landscape Projects and Gehl Architects, with no delineation of the carriageway except for subtle changes in materials. The route for vehicles along New Road is only suggested through the location of street furniture, such as public seating and street lights. The re-opening of the street has led to a 93% reduction in motor vehicle trips (12,000 fewer per day) and lower speeds (to around 10 MPH), alongside an increase in cyclist and pedestrian usage (93% and 162%, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Road City Centre Shared Space, Brighton (December 2007) |work=Scheme of the Month: January 2008 |date=December 2007 |publisher=Cycling England |url=http://www.cyclingengland.co.uk/scheme-of-the-month.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702044930/http://www.cyclingengland.co.uk/scheme-of-the-month.php |archivedate=2 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = New street designs are leaving blind people with the prospect of teaching their guide dogs new tricks. |publisher = NCE magazine |date = 31 December 2007 | url = http://www.nce.co.uk/transport/features/new_street_designs_are_leaving_blind_people_with_the_prospect_of_teaching_their_guide_dogs_new_tricks.html |accessdate = 25 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2008, shared space was introduced in [[Ashford, Kent]]. The scheme replaced a section of Ashford's former four-lane [[ring road]] with two-way streets on which drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians have equal priority. Unnecessary street furniture, road markings and traffic lights have been removed and the speed limit cut to 20&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name=rtpi&gt;{{cite web |title=Ringing the Changes: The Ashford Ring Road Project Kent County Council |date=27 January 2010 |publisher=[[Royal Town Planning Institute]] |url=http://www.rtpi.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?ap=1&amp;id=3336 |accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The scheme has been claimed to have improved safety records. Between November 2008 and January 2011, there have been four road casualties there, resulting from the six reported accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Just six accidents since Shared Space

Following the initial reports claiming a success for the Ashford scheme, other UK local councils planned to use a similar approach; these include [[Southend-on-Sea]], [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]], [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]], [[Hereford]], and [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=grontmij&gt;{{cite web |title=Winning streak continues for Ashford shared space scheme |date=5 October 2009 |publisher=[[Grontmij]] |url=http://grontmij.co.uk/mediacentre/news/Pages/winningstreak.aspx |accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been trials in [[Ipswich]], with ''shared space'' being a key feature of the design of the new [[Ravenswood, Ipswich|Ravenswood]] community being built on the site of the former [[Ipswich Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://online.ipswich.gov.uk/ppc/getDoc.aspx?s_Type=pad&amp;s_DocType=LAYO&amp;s_File=e%3a%5cplanning_application_documents%5c2005%5c05-00285-REM_APPLLAYO.pdf|title=Planning Application 05/00285/REM, Planning Layout |accessdate=4 March 2007 |date=18 February 2005 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Princess Royal Square (formerly Pier Square) in [[Weston-super-Mare]], the conventional road system has been replaced by a seafront open area. This has been complemented by the restoration of the Coalbrookdale fountain in its centre.

In [[Poynton]], Cheshire, it was found that as well as providing significant safety improvements, and regenerating the retail and social centre, the road capacity was not reduced after the redevelopment of a busy junction in the town incorporated shared space elements. In the scheme, the redevelopment of a multi-lane signalised crossroads, with a traffic flow of 26,000 vehicles per day, which was completed in March 2012, traffic lanes, signals, road markings, road signs and street clutter were all removed. In the first three years after the redevelopment there was one minor personal injury accident, compared to 4-7 serious incidents in each of the three years leading up to the project. Although no speed limit changes were made, average traffic speeds fell to around 20&amp;nbsp;mph and there were reductions in vehicle journey times as well as reductions in pedestrian delays at the junction.&lt;ref name=ice&gt;{{cite web|title=Poynton Town Centre: streetscape and place-making project|url=http://www.ice.org.uk/topics/community/Case-studies/Poynton-Town-Centre|publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Savannah, Georgia]], the [[Oglethorpe Plan]] has been adapted to accommodate pedestrian and vehicular traffic throughout a network of wards, each with a central square. The size and configuration of the squares restrains vehicular traffic to speeds under 20 miles per hour, a threshold speed beyond which shared space tends to break down.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6860">Shell tools, in the archaeological perspective, were tools fashioned by pre-historic humans from shells in lieu of stone tools. The use of shell tools during pre-historic times was a practice common to inhabitants of environments that lack the abundance of hard stones for making tools. This was the case with the islands surrounding the Pacific, including the [[Philippines]].
Shells were fashioned into tools, as well as ornaments. From adzes, scoops, spoons, dippers and other tools to personal ornaments such as earrings, anklets, bracelets and beads. These different artefacts made of shells were unearthed from various archaeological sites from the country.

==Shell Tools in the Philippines==

===Production and Manufacturing===

Shell adzes were made by percussion flaking and grinding. A piece of shell was extracted from the main shell by either direct percussion flaking or possibly by sticking against an anvil underneath as in bipolar percussion flaking. The final shaping and finishing work was done by either grinding the shell against a wet abrasive surface such as sandstone or by grinding against loose wet sand placed on a hard surface.  There are two locations on a giant clam that produces the largest pieces of shell. One is at the hinge and the other is at the ribs. Sections cut from these locations provide the thickest pieces of shell and the largest adzes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palmer|first1=Arthur Beau|title=Pacific Shell Adze|url=http://www.arthurbeaupalmer.com/cms/index.php/gallery/pacific/14-consultant-investment-fine-and-tribal-art/pacific/114-pacific-shell-adze-tridacna-gigas|website=arthurbeaupalmer.com|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shells of giant clams were fashioned into large spherical beads with holes drilled end to end at the center while pendants for the ear were ground from cone shells. Perforations were drilled at the center of the disk. Bracelets and anklets were both made from giant clams and cone shells. Shell bracelets made from the top shoulder of the body whorls of cone shells ([[Conus litteratus]]) are characteristic of the Late [[Neolithic]] Age. The natural spiral found along the shoulders of the shell serves as a decorative motif.&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum.gov.ph"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shell Bracelets and Pendants - New Stone Age|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Bracelets.html|website=nationalmuseum.gov.ph|publisher=National Museum of the Philippines|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidences==

===Duyong Cave Artefacts===

The oldest known ornaments made from cone shells were found in the early 1960s in the grave of an adult male in Duyong Cave in [[Palawan]]. A shell disk with a hole in the center was found next to his right ear and a disk with a hole by the edge was found on his chest. The shell ornaments were dated 4854 B.C.&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum.gov.ph"/&gt;

Duyong Cave, near the [[Tabon Caves]] of Palawan's western coast (Philippines) produced a "Neolithic Burial" with four [[Tridacna]] shell adzes and two different types of shell ornaments as well as other types of shell tools. The calibrated Carbon 14 date for the burial is 3,675 - 3,015 B.C. and 4,575 - 4,425 B.C. for a nearby fire hearth that also had shell debris associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;Solheim, WG (2006). Archaeology And Culture In Southeast Asia: Unraveling The Nusantao&lt;/ref&gt;

====Duyong Shell Adze====

Manufactured from the hinge line of a [[giant clam]] (Tridacna gigas), the shell adze was found associated with a Neolithic burial assemblage in Duyong Cave, Quezon, Palawan. This shell tool is similar to the shell adzes recovered in [[Okinawa]], Japan. Shells were used as tools in the Pacific as a replacement for hard stones which were not available on the islands. The presence of shell adzes not only in Palawan but also in [[Tawi-Tawi]] is very significant in the study of movements of people from the insular Southeast Asia to the Pacific. This shell tool is similar to the shell adzes recovered in [[Micronesia]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]] in Okinawa, Japan.&lt;ref name="masterpieces.asemus.museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=10638|title= Duyong Shell Adze|publisher= Virtual Collection of Asian Masterpieces|website=masterpieces.asemus.museum|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manunggul Shell Scoop===

The Manunggul Shell Spoon is a concave utensil with a sharp point at one end and a figure at the other end. The latter has a right extremity that forms to what appears like an arm with five digits. The left extremity and the head are missing. The outer surface of the body whorl near the figure has an angular shoulder. This shell spoon is not bilaterally symmetrical.&lt;ref name="masterpieces.asemus.museum"/&gt;

===Mataas Shell Scoop===

The Mataas shell scoop is a concave utensil with a sharp point at one end and a figure at the other end. The latter has a right extremity that forms to what appears like an arm with five digits. The left extremity and the head are missing. The outer surface of the body whorl near the figure has an angular shoulder. This shell scoop, recovered in [[Cagraray Island]], Albay is not bilaterally symmetrical.
Shell scoops made from the body whorl of [[Turbo marmoratus]] first appeared in the Late Neolithic Period at Manunggul Cave, Quezon, Palawan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Cultural Treasures of Philippine Archaeology|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/NCT.html|website=nationalmuseum.gov.ph|publisher=National Museum of the Philippines|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continued Use==

Up to the [[Metal Age]], shells were the major material for the manufacture of both tools and ornaments but shell technology attained its highest development during the Neolithic Period.
At present, the people of Palawan living near Tabon Caves still fashion bracelets from shells. The boring and polishing of the shell ornaments is done with stone tools.&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum.gov.ph"/&gt;

Shells were found to be useful during pre-historic times when they provided an alternative material for the production of tools which made the development of pre-historic humans possible. These tools were found in various sites which suggests the vast reaches of its utility. Even up to the present many cultures and traditions still make use of these shells as either tools or ornaments. Although the use of shells as tools may have become just a ceremonial practice but its use as ornamentation still persists.

The '''Smart Personal Objects Technology''' ('''SPOT''') is a discontinued initiative by [[Microsoft]] to create intelligent and personal [[home appliance]]s, [[consumer electronics]], and other objects through new hardware capabilities and software features.

Development of SPOT began as an incubation project initiated by the [[Microsoft Research]] division.&lt;ref name="Thurrott"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://winsupersite.com/article/mobile-computing-devices/smart-personal-object-technology-spot-preview-127881 |title=Smart Personal Object Technology (SPOT) Preview |last=Thurrott |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Thurrott |date=January 16, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721001244/http://www.winsupersite.com/article/mobile-computing-devices/smart-personal-object-technology-spot-preview-127881 |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |publisher=[[Penton (company)|Penton]] |work=SuperSite for Windows |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.microsoft.com/2003/01/09/qa-microsoft-and-watch-making-partners-announce-first-smart-personal-objects-technology-wristwatches/ |title=Q&amp;A: Microsoft and Watch-making Partners Announce First Smart Personal Objects Technology Wristwatches |date=January 9, 2003 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=News Center |accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicrosoftCES2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.microsoft.com/2003/01/09/microsoft-presents-smart-personal-objects-technology-spot-based-wristwatches-at-ces/ |title=Microsoft Presents Smart Personal Objects Technology (SPOT)-Based Wristwatches at CES |date=January 9, 2003 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=News Center |accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPOT was first announced by [[Bill Gates]] at the [[COMDEX]] computer exposition event in 2002,&lt;ref name="SPOT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.microsoft.com/2002/11/17/microsoft-launches-smart-personal-object-technology-initiative/ |title=Microsoft Launches Smart Personal Object Technology Initiative |date=November 17, 2002 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=News Center |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and additional details were revealed by Microsoft at the 2003 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] where Gates demonstrated a set of prototype [[smartwatch|smart watches]]—the first type of device that would support the technology.&lt;ref name="Thurrott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/technology/articles/CES_2003.htm |title=Web Special: Consumer Electronics Show 2003 |last=Walker |first=Leslie |date=January 16, 2003 |publisher=[[Jeff Bezos|Nash Holdings]] |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike more recent technologies, SPOT did not use more traditional forms of connectivity, such as [[3G]] or [[Wi-Fi]], but relied on [[FM broadcasting]] [[subcarrier]] [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] as a method of data distribution.&lt;ref name="AtariConnection"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/53284-microsofts-spot-the-atari-connection |title=Microsoft’s SPOT: The Atari Connection |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=January 31, 2003 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media]] |work=[[ExtremeTech]] |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArsTechnica"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/11/lessons-learned-from-microsofts-pioneering-and-standalone-smartwatches/ |title=Lessons learned from Microsoft's pioneering—and standalone—smartwatches |last=Bright |first=Peter |date=September 11, 2014 |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |work=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While several types of electronics would eventually support the technology throughout its lifecycle, SPOT was considered a [[commercial failure]]. Reasons that have been cited for its failure include its [[subscription business model|subscription-based business model]], support limited to [[North America]], the emergence of more efficient and popular forms of data distribution, and mobile feature availability that surpasses the features that SPOT offered.&lt;ref name="ArsTechnica"/&gt;

==History==

===Development===
Development of SPOT began as an incubation project led by Microsoft engineer, Bill Mitchell, and initiated by the Microsoft Research division.&lt;ref name="Thurrott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MicrosoftCES2003"/&gt; Mitchell would enlist the help of Larry Karr, president of SCA Data Systems, to develop the project. Karr had previously worked in the 1980s to develop technology for [[Atari]] that would distribute games in a manner distinct from the company's competitors; Karr proposed FM broadcasting subcarrier transmission as a method of distribution, technology which would also be used by Microsoft's SPOT.&lt;ref name="AtariConnection"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCWorld"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/48208/ces_-_microsoft_spot_technology_has_humble_origins/ |title=CES - Microsoft's SPOT technology has humble origins |last=Niccolai |first=James |date=January 13, 2003 |publisher=[[IDG]] |work=[[PC World]] |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft Research and SCA Data Systems would ultimately develop the [[DirectBand]] subcarrier technology for SPOT.&lt;ref name="SCA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scadata.com/clients.htm |author=SCA Data Systems Inc. |title=Clients |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{citation |title=How Microsoft Lost the Wrist-Top |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |volume=18 |issue=7 |page=27 |last=Baker |first=Chris |date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Semiconductor]] would aid in the development of device [[chipset]]s, which would feature a [[ARM7]] [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]] and [[read-only memory|ROM]], [[static random-access memory|SRAM]], and a 100&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] [[RF module|RF receiver chip]].&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A2003"/&gt;

SPOT was unveiled by Bill Gates at the annual COMDEX computer exposition event in fall of 2002.&lt;ref name="SPOT"/&gt; Gates stated that "new devices and technologies will help bring about the next computing revolution" and demonstrated [[refrigerator magnet]]s that displayed the current time and [[score (sport)|sports scores]], and an [[alarm clock]] that could display a list of upcoming appointments, [[traffic reporting|traffic updates]], and [[weather forecasting|weather forecasts]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2487787.stm |title=Bill Gates spots the next big thing |last=Anderson |first=Kevin |date=November 18, 2002 |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MS-COMDEX"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.microsoft.com/2002/11/17/at-comdex-bill-gates-reports-on-state-of-the-digital-decade/ |title=At COMDEX, Bill Gates Reports on State of the 'Digital Decade' |date=November 17, 2002 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=News Center |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ExtremeTech"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/52564-gates-proposes-webenabled-alarm-clocks |title=Gates Proposes Web-Enabled Alarm Clocks |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=November 18, 2002 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |work=[[ExtremeTech]] |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Windows Hardware Engineering Conference]] of 2003, Gates unveiled a new set of hardware-based navigational controls codenamed XEEL, designed to create a consistent navigation experience across [[Windows (operating system)|Windows]]-based devices, such as [[smartphone|smart phones]], [[tablet computer|tablet PCs]], and those powered by SPOT.&lt;ref name="BillGatesWinHEC2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.microsoft.com/2003/05/06/bill-gates-unveils-next-wave-of-windows-pc-innovation-at-winhec-2003/ |title=Bill Gates Unveils Next Wave of Windows PC Innovation at WinHEC 2003 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=News Center |date=May 6, 2003 |accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DirectionsOnMicrosoft"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://directionsonmicrosoft.com/sample/DOMIS/update/2003/06jun/0603mtofoc.htm |title=Message to OEMs: Focus on Consumers |last=Rosoff |first=Matt |date=May 19, 2003 |publisher=Directions on Microsoft |archivedate=June 2, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030602055949/http://www.directionsonmicrosoft.com/sample/DOMIS/update/2003/06jun/0603mtofoc.htm |accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft intended for XEEL to create a consistent navigation experience across hardware devices that equaled the software interface navigation consistency introduced by the [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] [[scroll wheel]].&lt;ref name="WillPoole"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.microsoft.com/speeches/speech-transcript-will-poole-windows-hardware-engineering-conference-winhec-2003/ |title=Speech Transcript – Will Poole, Windows Hardware Engineering Conference (WinHEC) 2003 |date=May 7, 2003 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=News Center |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003, Microsoft unveiled its [[MSN Direct]] wireless service developed specifically for SPOT, which would be made available across North America. The company stated that the service would enable the delivery of personalized information on devices and, as an example of this functionality, would allow users to receive messages sent from [[Windows Live Messenger|MSN Messenger]] or calendar appointment reminders from [[Microsoft Outlook]].&lt;ref name="MSNDirect"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.microsoft.com/2003/06/04/microsoft-announces-wireless-service-plans-for-smart-watches-available-this-fall/ |title=Microsoft Announces Wireless Service Plans For Smart Watches Available This Fall |date=June 4, 2003 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=News Center |accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCNews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97621 |title=A Wristwatch of Wireless Data |last=Preston |first=Cheri |date=June 13, 2003 |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |work=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSN Direct would use a subscription-based business model, available through monthly or yearly service plans.&lt;ref name="MSNDirect"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SharesDetails"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,111035,00.asp |title=Microsoft Shares Smart Watch Details |last=Evers |first=Joris |date=June 5, 2003 |publisher=[[IDG]] |work=[[PCWorld]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030622193157/http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,111035,00.asp |archivedate=June 22, 2003 |accessdate=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSN Direct relied on the DirectBand subcarrier technology developed by Microsoft in conjunction with SCA Data Systems.&lt;ref name="SCA"/&gt;

==Overview==
SPOT extended functionality of traditional devices to include features not originally envisaged for them; a SPOT-powered coffeemaker, for example, would be able to display information such as weather forecasts on an electronic visual display.&lt;ref name="ArsTechnica"/&gt; Smartwatches featured digital watch displays, referred to as ''Channels'', that presented information in a manner that could be customized by a user—a user could also specify the default channel to be displayed; this feature was functionally analogous with a [[home screen]] commonly seen in [[mobile operating system]]s. Additional channels could be [[download]]ed from a specialized website,&lt;ref name="Thurrott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MicrosoftCES2003"/&gt; and a ''Glance'' feature would allow a user to cycle through downloaded information.&lt;ref name="Thurrott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPOTWatchFirstLook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1427911,00.asp |title=SPOT Watch First Look |last=Miller |first=Michael |date=January 7, 2004 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |work=[[PCMag]] |accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social viewing''' describes a recently developed practice revolving around the ability for multiple users to aggregate from multiple sources and view [[online]] [[video]]s together in a synchronized viewing experience.

Typically the experience also involves some form of [[Instant messaging &amp; messengers|instant messaging]] or [[communication]] to facilitate discussion pertaining to the common viewing experience.

The term in this context originated with the [[Toronto]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]-based company View2Gether&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.view2gether.com/ View2gether – Welcome to Social Viewing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213230139/http://www.view2gether.com/ |date=2007-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has created proprietary technology for aggregating content from sources not controlled by the user for synchronized play and inclusion in common [[playlist]]s by multiple participants with a commensurate instant messaging chat function. Other sites which provide similar functionality include Oortle (Photophlow),&lt;ref&gt;[http://oortle.com/ Oortle home page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429201312/http://www.oortle.com/ |date=2008-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SeeToo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seetoo.com/ SeeToo home page]&lt;/ref&gt; and development of social viewing for existing portals such as Yahoo have recently been announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timetags.research.yahoo.com/zync/ Zync from Yahoo! Research Berkeley&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610232321/http://timetags.research.yahoo.com/zync/ |date=2008-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been used in some cases to describe online viewing within the framework of a social network,&lt;ref&gt;http://paidcontent.org/article/419-bebo-launches-open-media-platform-for-social-viewing-22-tv-partners/&lt;/ref&gt; however View2gether and similar sites have reconfigured the term to mean a common viewing experience as a social activity.

Social viewing has also been used in the past to describe activities such as gathering for the viewing of particular [[television program]]s, such as [[soap opera]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.sabinet.co.za/images/ejour/comcare/comcare_v23_n2_a2.pdf Soap opera viewing in a communal context : an ethnographic examination of the viewing experiences of black Zulu-speaking students living in university residences&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of modern social viewing sites include [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]], [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]].

[[Image:Sherry cellar, Solera system, 2003.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sherry]] solera]]

'''''Solera''''' is a process for [[aging (wine)|aging]] liquids such as [[wine]], [[beer]], [[vinegar]], and [[brandy]], by fractional blending in such a way that the finished product is a mixture of ages, with the average age gradually increasing as the process continues over many years. The purpose of this labor-intensive process is the maintenance of a reliable style and quality of the beverage over time.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Hugh, ''Modern encyclopedia of wine'', 1983 ed. New York:Mitchell Beasley (Simon and Schuster], p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Solera'' means "on the ground" in Spanish, and it refers to the lower level of the set of barrels or other containers used in the process; the liquid (traditionally transferred from barrel to barrel, top to bottom, the oldest mixtures being in the barrel right "on the ground"), although the containers in today's process are not necessarily stacked physically in the way that this implies, but merely carefully labeled. Products which are often ''solera'' aged include [[Sherry]], [[Madeira wine|Madeira]], [[Lillet]], [[Port wine]], [[Marsala wine|Marsala]], [[Mavrodafni]], [[Muscat Grape|Muscat]], and [[Muscadelle]] wines; [[Balsamic vinegar|Balsamic]], [[Commandaria]], some [[Vins doux naturels]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cellartracker.com/classic/wine.asp?iWine=1236161, accessioned 4/2/2016,&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sherry Vinegar|Sherry]] vinegars; [[Brandy de Jerez]]; [[beer]]; [[rum]]s; and [[whisky|whiskies]]. Since the origin of this process is out of the Iberian peninsula, most of the traditional terminology is in Spanish and Portuguese.

== Solera process ==

In the ''solera'' process, a succession of containers are filled with the product over a series of equal aging intervals (usually a year). A group of one or more containers, called scales, '''criaderas''' ('nurseries'), or '''clases''' are filled for each interval. At the end of the interval after the last scale is filled, the oldest scale in the ''solera''&lt;ref&gt;the word 'Solera' is also used for the last scale.&lt;/ref&gt; is tapped for part of its content, which is bottled. Then that scale is refilled from the next oldest scale, and that one in succession from the second-oldest, down to the youngest scale, which is refilled with new product. This procedure is repeated at the end of each aging interval. The transferred product mixes with the older product in the next barrel.

[[File:ValdiviaJerez55.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sherry]] solera]]
No container is ever drained, so some of the earlier product always remains in each container. This remnant diminishes to a tiny level, but there can be significant traces of product much older than the average, depending on the transfer fraction. In theory traces of the very first product placed in the ''solera'' may be present even after 50 or more cycles.&lt;ref&gt; Some of the oldest Soleras may be of the order of a hundred or more years old.  In this case it is mathematically unlikely that even a few molecules of the earliest wines would be present, unless the transfer fraction is impractically infinitesimal.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Andalusia, Spain, the latest regulations for labeling requires careful labeling and record-keeping, usually via computer, allowing the winemaker or regulator to easily access the average age of each container, which depends not only on the refreshment interval and number of scales, but also the relative volumes that are chosen for the refreshment process—a larger refreshment and final removal for bottling will result in a younger average age (see [[Aging]]).  The upper quality levels implied by the labeling system requires the bottled wine to be greater in age than the regulatory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;(for Sherries, there is a body called the '''Consejo Regulador''' is responsible for overseeing this system, and the age requirements are as shown here--see New York: Mantius, 2012; Liem, Peter and Barquín, Jesús, ''Sherry, Manzanilla, and Morilla, a guide to the traditional wines of Andalusia'', pages 67-69&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aging ==
[[File:Pedro ximenez wine.jpg|left|thumb|A Pedro Ximénez Sherry whose wine label indicates that the wine was aged in a solera that has purportedly been in operation since 1827.]]
The age of product from the first bottling is the number of containers times the aging interval. As the ''solera'' matures, the average age of product [[Asymptote|
asymptotically]] approaches one plus the number of scales (excluding the top scale) (K) divided by the fraction of a scale transferred or bottled (α), or (1 + K/α).&lt;ref&gt;Mike Voelkel, Actuary; Ari Weinstein, Sommelier/Mathematician/Philosopher&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, suppose the ''solera'' consists of three barrels of wine, and half of each barrel is transferred once a year.  At the end of the third year (and each subsequent year), half the third barrel is bottled. This first bottling is aged three years. The third barrel is then refilled with by transferring half of the wine from the second barrel.  The wine transferred from the second barrel has an average age of 2.5 years (at the end of year 2, after barrel transfers, it was half 2-year old wine, half 1-year old wine, for an average age of 1.5 years; at the end of year 3, before barrel transfers, it will have aged another year for an average age of 2.5 years).  The second bottling will then be half 3.5 years old and half four years old (the wine left in the last barrel at the previous cycle), for an average age of 3.75 years. The third bottling will be an average age of 4.25 years (one half wine that was left over from the second bottling - average age 4.75 years, and one half wine transferred from the second barrel after the second bottling - average age 3.75 years).  After 20 years, the output of the ''solera'' would be a mix of wine from 3 to 20 years old, averaging very slightly under five years. The average age asymptotically converges on five years as the ''solera'' continues.

== Solera production ==

The output of the solera is the fraction of the last scale taken off for bottling each cycle. The amount of product tied up in the ''solera'' is usually many times larger than the production. This means that a ''solera'' is a very large capital investment for a winemaker. If done with actual barrels, the producer may have several ''soleras'' running in parallel. For a small producer, a ''solera'' may be the largest capital investment, and a valuable asset to be passed down to descendants. An economic concomitant of the Andalusian wine industry are '''Almacenistas''' ('warehousers', small or larger investors who purchase solera-produced material and carefully maintain it over many years so that it can be purchased for current needs by bodegas who are actively blending for the market.

[[File:Bodega-TioPepe-Jerez-Dsc02980.jpg|thumb|[[Brandy de Jerez]] barrels aging]]
Wine produced from a solera cannot formally have a vintage date because it is a blend of vintages from many years. However, some bottlings are labeled with an age for marketing reasons, which could be the date that the solera was founded. In most instances, It is unclear whether such age indications denotes the average age, or the age of the oldest batch.  In Andalusia, the various average age categories, up to 30 years of age at present, are much better documented to the regulatory body and on the bottle labels at present than they were just a decade or two ago.

== Solera in different countries ==

This process is known as ''solera'' in Spanish, and was developed by the producers of sherry. In a Spanish sherry ''solera'', the vintner may transfer about a third of each barrel a year. A solera sherry has to be at least three years old when bottled.

A quite similar process is called '''sostrera''',&lt;ref&gt;CellarTracker'' ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; used to produce fortified wines in the Mediterranean regions of France.

In [[Sicily]], where [[Marsala wine]] is made, the system is called ''in perpetuum''.

Solera vinification is used in the making of [[Mavrodafni]] ("Black Laurel"), a fortified red dessert wine made in the Northern [[Peloponnese]] in [[Greece]]. Exceptional ''Mavrodafni'' vintages are released every 20 or 30 years: they are of minimal availability and expensive.

Vintners in [[Rutherglen, Victoria|Rutherglen, Australia]] produce fortified muscat-style and [[Tokaji|Tokay]]-style wines using the solera process. In [[South Australia]], some fortified wines (akin to tawny port) are made from blends of [[Shiraz]], [[Grenache]] and [[Mourvedre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grantburgewines.com.au/wine/fortified-wines-10-year-old-tawny-10-yo&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glenfiddich]], a [[Strathspey, Scotland|Speyside]] distillery in [[Scotland]], has a 15-year-old [[whisky]] that uses a vatting process similar to the solera. The whisky is labelled as their "15 year old single malt Scotch Whisky". For Scotch whisky, the stated age must refer to the youngest of whisky's components. Barrels are emptied into the solera vat and mixed. Then whisky is drawn from the vat to be bottled, with the vat never being more than half emptied. Since the process began in 1998, the vat has never been emptied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A HERITAGE OF INNOVATION: OUR SOLERA VAT|url=http://www.glenfiddich.com/uk/explore/expert-blog/2013/a-heritage-of-innovation-our-solera-vat/|website=Glenfiddich|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France some producers use the "perpétuelle" method to blend base wines for [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] across the years for non-vintage [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] such as Francis Boulard Cuvée Petraea.

The oldest [[port wine]] producer in America, Old Vine Tinta Solera at Ficklin, has used a solera since 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ficklin.com/wine.php|title=Old Vine Tinta Port|accessdate=2014-01-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202100814/http://www.ficklin.com/wine.php|archivedate=2014-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ficklin.com/blog/?p=149|title=The Tinta Solera|accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Okinawa]], [[Japan]], where ''[[awamori]]'' is made, the traditional system similar to the solera is called ''shitsugi''.

The solera process has been used since the 17th century to produce sour ales in Sweden, where it is known as "hundraårig öl" (hundred-year beer). The beer is rarely commercially available, being instead made at the large manors for private consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Ölets historia i Sverige, volume 1, Harald Thunæus, Almqvist &amp; Wicksell, Stockholm, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Comment this out as it lacks sources while also raising possible accusations. That NEEDS to be sourced
== Possible ''solera'' abuse==
[[Italy|Italian]] labeling laws permit blended vinegar to be labeled with the age of the oldest vinegar in the blend. Some balsamic vinegar producers have established ''solera'' aging facilities, and claimed the age of the entire ''solera'' as the age of the vinegar produced. In the case of the more strictly-controlled and more expensive vinegars, such as ''[[balsamic vinegar|aceto balsamico tradizionale]]'', this labeling practice is not permitted.--&gt;

(2015). Sousveillance: Implications for Privacy, Security, Trust, and the Law. Consumer Electronics Magazine, IEEE, 4(2), 92-94.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The term "sousveillance", coined by [[Steve Mann]],&lt;ref&gt;Monahan, Torin (2006). ''Surveillance And Security: Technological Politics And Power in Everyday Life'', p.158. {{ISBN|9780415953931}}.&lt;/ref&gt; stems from the contrasting French words ''sur'', meaning "above", and ''sous'', meaning "below", i.e. "[[surveillance]]" denotes the "[[Eye in the sky (camera)|eye-in-the-sky]]" watching from above, whereas "sousveillance" denotes bringing the camera or other means of observation down to human level, either physically (mounting cameras on people rather than on buildings), or hierarchically (ordinary people doing the watching, rather than higher authorities or architectures doing the watching).&lt;ref&gt;Course developed by New York based artist [[Joy Garnett]] and taught initially at the City College of New York's Digital and Interdisciplinary Art Practice MFA program (DIAP): "Sousveillance: The Art of Networked Surveillance: Decoding the Social and the Private"[http://newsgrist.typepad.com/diap_sousveiller/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=defs|
Alternative definitions of both ''sur-'' and ''sous-'' ''veillance'' (the act of watching), in addition to the definition above, include:

* Surveillance is defined as cameras (or other sensors) affixed to property (real-estate, e.g. land, by way of posts or poles, or buildings), whereas sousveillance is defined as cameras (or other sensors) borne by people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sousveillance: Inventing and Using Wearable Computing Devices for Data Collection in Surveillance Environments|date=2002|publisher=|journal=Surveillance &amp; Society|volume=1|issue=3|pp=331–355|author1=S.

While surveillance and sousveillance both generally refer to visual monitoring, the terms also denote other forms of monitoring such as audio surveillance or sousveillance.  In the audio sense (e.g. recording of phone conversations), sousveillance is referred to as "one party consent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anonequity.org/weblog/archives/2006/01/exploring_equiv_1.php|title=blogging ''On the Identity Trail''|website=www.anonequity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Undersight''' (inverse oversight) is sousveillance at high-level, e.g. "citizen undersight" being reciprocal to a congressional oversight committee or the like.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/conferences.html CACR] (Centre For Applied Cryptographic Research), [http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/conferences/2001/isw-eighth/announcement.html 8th CACR Information Security Workshop &amp; 2nd Annual Privacy and Security Workshop], The Human Face of Privacy Technology, November 1–2, 2001, The University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada; [http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/conferences/2001/isw-eighth/slides/slides.html Slides and recordings.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sousveillance: Wearable Computing and Citizen "Undersight"", h-Plus Magazine, 2009jul10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Is "Undersight" Unconstitutional?", Ian Ayres, Yale Law School, New York Times, January 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inverse surveillance''' is a subset of sousveillance with a particular emphasis on the "watchful vigilance from underneath" and a form of [[surveillance]] inquiry or legal protection involving the recording, monitoring, study, or analysis of surveillance systems, proponents of surveillance, and possibly also recordings of authority figures and their actions. Inverse surveillance is typically an activity undertaken by those who are generally the subject of surveillance, and may thus be thought of as a form of an [[ethnography]] or [[ethnomethodology]] study (i.e. an analysis of the surveilled from the perspective of a participant in a society under surveillance).&lt;ref name=wearcam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wearcam.org/sousveillance.pdf |title=Sousveillance: Inventing and Using Wearable Computing Devices for Data Collection in Surveillance Environments, Surveillance &amp; Society 1(3): 331–355 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sousveillance typically involves community-based recording from first person perspectives, without necessarily involving any specific political agenda, whereas inverse-surveillance is a form of sousveillance that is typically directed at, or used to collect data to analyze or study, surveillance or its proponents (e.g., the actions of police or protestors at a protest rally).&lt;ref&gt;Sousveillance, direct action and the anti-corporate globalization movement.

Sousveillance is not necessarily counter-surveillance; i.e. sousveillance can be used to "counter" the forces of surveillance, or it can also be used together with surveillance to create a more complete "veillance" ("Surveillance is a half-truth without sousveillance"&lt;ref&gt;[Mann, Steve, et al. "Declaration of Veillance (Surveillance is Half-Truth)." in Games Entertainment Media Conference (GEM), 2015 IEEE. IEEE, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;).  The question of "[[Who watches the watchmen?|Who watches the watchers]]" is dealt with more properly under the topic of metaveillance&lt;ref&gt;["Surveillance (oversight), Sousveillance (undersight), and Metaveillance (seeing sight itself)", IEEE CVPR 2016, pages 1408-1417, http://wearcam.org/kineveillance.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (the veillance of veillance) than sousveillance.

== Inverse surveillance ==
Inverse surveillance is a type of sousveillance. The more general concept of sousveillance goes beyond just inverse surveillance and the associated twentieth century political "us ''versus'' them" framework for citizens to photograph [[police]],  shoppers to photograph shopkeepers, or passengers to photograph taxicab drivers. [[Howard Rheingold]] commented in his book ''[[Smart Mobs]]'' that this is similar to the pedestrian−driver concept, i.e. these are roles that many of us take both sides of, from time to time. Many aspects of sousveillance were examined in the general category of "reciprocal accountability" in David Brin's 1997 non-fiction book The Transparent Society, and also in Brin's novels. The first ''International Workshop on Inverse Surveillance'', IWIS, took place in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;IWIS Website, http://wearcam.org/iwis/&lt;/ref&gt; chaired by Dr. Jim Gemmell, ([[MyLifeBits]]), [[Joi Ito]], [[Anastasios Venetsanopoulos]], and [[Steve Mann]], among others.

One of the things that brought inverse surveillance to light was the reactions of security guards to electric seeing aids and similar sousveillance practices.  It seemed, early on, that the more [[camera]]s that were in an establishment, the more the guards disliked the use of an electric seeing aid, such as the [[EyeTap]] eyeglasses.  It was through simply wearing electric seeing aids, as a passive observer, that it was discovered that surveillance and sousveillance can cause conflict and sometimes confrontation.  This led some researchers to explore why the perpetuators of surveillance are suspicious of sousveillance, and thus defined the notion of inverse surveillance as a new and interesting facet of studies in sousveillance.&lt;ref name=wearcam/&gt;

Since the year 2001, December 24 has been [[World Sousveillance Day]] with groups of participants in [[New York City]], [[Toronto]], [[Boston]], [[Florida]], [[Vancouver]], [[Japan]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]].  However, this designated day focuses only on hierarchical sousveillance, whereas there are a number of groups around the world working on combining the two forms of sousveillance.

An essay from Wired magazine predicts that sousveillance is an important development that will be on the rise in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Neil M., Watching the Watchers (November 4, 2013). Wired Magazine [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2350002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sousveillance of a state by its citizens has been credited with addressing many problems such as election fraud or electoral misdeeds, as well as providing good governance. For example, mobile phones were used in [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Ghana]] in 2007 for checking malpractices and intimidation during elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/04a981ce-c553-11dd-b516-000077b07658.html#axzz1PQRqTRu5 Ghana puts faith in humble text message] Matthew Green, Financial Times,  December 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent area of research further developed at IWIS was the equilibrium between surveillance and sousveillance. Current "[[equiveillance]] theory" holds that sousveillance, to some extent, often reduces or eliminates the need for surveillance.  In this sense it is possible to replace the Panoptic God's eye view of surveillance with a more community-building ubiquitous personal experience capture. [[Crime]]s, for example, might then be solved by way of collaboration among the citizenry rather than through the watching over the citizenry from above. But it is not so black-and-white as this dichotomy suggests.  In particular, citizens watching over their neighbors is not necessarily "better" than the alternative: an increase in community self-reliance might be offset by an uncomfortable "nosy neighbor" effect. "Personal sousveillance" has been referred to as "coveillance" by Mann, Nolan and Wellman.

[[Copwatch]] is a network of [[United States|American]] and [[Canadians|Canadian]] volunteer organizations that "police the police." Copwatch groups usually engage in monitoring of the police, videotaping police activity, and educating the public about police misconduct. Fitwatch is a group who photograph [[Forward Intelligence Team]]s (police photographers) in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8010098.stm When all video all] Finlo Rohrer, BBC News Magazine April 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal sousveillance ==
[[File:WearableWirelessWebcamSteveMannVisualFilter1994December13th.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Steve Mann]]'s Visual Filter for continuous live webcast as well as viewing (i.e. visual reality modification in realtime).]]

Personal sousveillance is the art, science, and technology of personal experience capture, processing, storage, retrieval, and transmission, such as lifelong audiovisual recording by way of [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] [[prosthetics]], such as seeing-aids, visual memory aids, and the like. Even today's personal sousveillance technologies like [[camera phone]]s and [[Blog|weblogs]] tend to build a [[sense of community]], in contrast to surveillance that some have said is corrosive to [[community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=Gordon|author2=Marie Griffiths |author3=Maria Kutar |title=A day in the digital life: a preliminary sousveillance study|ssrn=1923629|date=7 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal, ethical, and policy issues surrounding personal sousveillance are largely yet to be explored, but there are close parallels to the social and legal norms surrounding [[telephone tapping|recording of telephone conversations]].  When one or more parties to the conversation record it, it is called "sousveillance", whereas when the conversation is recorded by a person who is not a party to the conversation (such as a prison guard violating a client-lawyer relationship), the recording is called "surveillance".

"Targeted sousveillance" refers to sousveillance of a specific individual by one or more other individuals.  Usually, the targeted individual is a representative or proponent of surveillance, so targeted sousveillance is often inverse surveillance or '''hierarchical sousveillance'''. "Hierarchical sousveillance" refers, for example, to citizens photographing police, shoppers photographing shopkeepers, or taxicab passengers photographing cab drivers.  So, for example, targeting former White House security official Admiral [[John Poindexter]] with sousveillance follows this more political narrative.

Classy's Kitchen describes sousveillance as "another way to add further introspection to the commons that keeps society open but still makes the world smaller and safer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classy.dk/log/archive/2003_02.html |title=Avoiding Big Brother  |date=February 26, 2003 |website=Classy's Kitchen |accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way sousveillance may be regarded as a possible replacement for surveillance.  In this sur/sousveillance replacement, one can consider an operative social norm that would require cameras to be attached to a human operator.  Under such a scenario, any objections to the camera could be raised by another human more easily than it would be to interact with a lamp post upon which is mounted a surveillance camera.  Thus, the argument is that cameras attached to people ought to be less offensive than cameras attached to inanimate objects, because there is at least one responsible party present to operate the camera.  This responsible-party argument is analogous to that used for operation of a motor vehicle, where a responsible driver is present, in contrast to remote or automated operation of a motor vehicle.

Beyond the political or breaching of hierarchical structure explored in academia, the more rapidly emerging discourse on sousveillance within industry is "personal sousveillance", namely the recording of an activity by a participant in the activity.

As the technologies get smaller and easier to use, the capture, recording, and playback of everyday life gets that much easier to initiate spontaneously in unexpected situations. For example, David Ollila, a manufacturer of video camera equipment, was trapped for four hours aboard a [[Comair]] plane at [[JFK Airport]] in [[New York City]]. When he recorded an interview with the [[Aviator|pilot]] about the situation, the pilot called the police who then removed Ollila for questioning and removed everyone from the plane.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas McArthur, "Flights of Fancy", ''Toronto Globe and Mail'', December 29, 2007, p. R16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording a situation is only part of the sousveillance process. Communicating is also important. Video-sharing sites such as [[YouTube]] and photo-sharing sites such as [[Flickr]] play a vital role. For example, police ''[[agent provocateur|agents provocateur]]'' were quickly revealed on YouTube when they infiltrated a demonstration in [[Montebello, Quebec]], against the leaders of [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and the United States (August 2007). When the head of the Quebec police publicly stated that there was no police presence, a sousveillance video showed him to be wrong. When he revised his statement to say that the police provocateurs were peaceful observers, the same video showed them to be masked, wearing police boots, and in one case holding a rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|pages=A5 |last=Clark |first=Campbell |author2=Ingrid Peritz |author3=Ian Bailey |title=Sûreté du Québec to review practices |work=Globe and Mail |accessdate=2007-08-31 |date=2007-08-25 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070825.wyoutube25/BNStory/National/home |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930060012/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070825.wyoutube25/BNStory/National/home |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many similar examples, such as the widely viewed [[YouTube]] video of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] campus policemen [[UCLA Taser incident|tasering a student]]. In Russia, as well as in some other countries where road users trust neither each other nor police, [[onboard camera]]s are so ubiquitous that thousands of videos of automobile accidents and near-miss incidents have been uploaded. The unanticipated [[2013 Russian meteor event]] was well documented from a dozen angles via the use of these devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghosttheory.com/2013/02/19/russian-dash-cam-craze |title=Russian Dash Cam Craze |publisher=Ghost Theory |date=2013-02-19 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in February 2015, dashcams caught valuable footage of the crash of [[TransAsia Airways]] Flight GE235.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/transasia-airways-flight-ge235-taiwan-plane-crash-caught-by-dashcam-1.2944464 |accessdate=2015-03-04&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alibi sousveillance==
[[File:BikeCamera.jpg|thumb|200px|Cameras can easily be mounted on bicycles, to record sports activities — or record acts of [[road rage]].]]
Alibi sousveillance is a form of sousveillance activity aimed at generating an [[alibi]] as evidence to defend against allegations of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;"Sousveillance: Wearable Computing and Citizen "Undersight"", by: Steve Mann, [http://hplusmagazine.com/2009/07/10/sousveillance-wearable-computing-and-citizen-undersight/ hplus magazine], Published: July 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hasan Elahi]], a [[University of Maryland]] professor, has produced a sousveillance for his entire life, after being detained at an airport because he was erroneously placed on the [[Terrorist Screening Database|US terrorist watchlist]]. Some of his sousveillance activities include using his cell phone as a [[tracking device]], and publicly posting [[debit card]] and other transactions that document his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clive Thompson |url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-06/ps_transparency/ |date=May 2007 |publisher=Wired.com |title=The Visible Man: An FBI Target Puts His Whole Life Online |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913190505/http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-06/ps_transparency |archivedate=September 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One specific use of alibi sousveillance is the growing trend of [[Body worn video (police equipment)|police officers wearing body cameras]] while on patrol. Well-publicized events involving police-citizen altercations (such as the case of [[Ferguson unrest|Michael Brown]] in Ferguson, Missouri) have increased calls for police to wear body-cameras and so capture evidence of the incidents, for the benefit of them personally plus the criminal justice system as a whole.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nunes|first=Iesha S.|date=2015|title=Hands up, Don't Shoot: Police Misconduct and the Need for Body Cameras|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/uflr67&amp;amp;div=47&amp;amp;g_sent=1&amp;amp;collection=journals|journal=Florida Law Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By having officers use sousveillance, police forces can generate hours of video evidence to be used in cases like that of Michael Brown, and the video evidence can act as an important alibi in the judicial proceedings in regards to who is truly at fault.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Regardless of the outcome of such events, contemporaneous audio-video evidence can be extremely valuable in respect of compliance- and enforcement-related events.

==Police use==
[[Body worn video|Use of wearable cameras by police officers]] combined with video streaming and recording in an archive results in a record of the interactions of the officer with civilians and criminals. The small cameras are made by [[Axon (company)|Axon]], [[Looxcie]], and probably other firms. Experiments with police use in [[Rialto, California]] in 2012 to 2013 resulted in a reduction of both complaints against officers and reduction in use of violence by officers. The public is shielded from police misconduct and the police officer from bogus complaints.&lt;ref name=NYT4613&gt;{{cite news|title=Wearing a Badge, and a Video Camera|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/business/wearable-video-cameras-for-police-officers.html|accessdate=April 7, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 6, 2013|author=Randall Stross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because these body cameras are turned on for every encounter with the public, privacy issues have been brought up with specific emphasis on special victim cases such as rape or domestic violence.  Police worry that with a camera right in front of the victim, they will not feel comfortable in revealing all the information that they know.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-body-cameras-20140927-story.html|title=Growing use of police body cameras raises privacy concerns|last=Pearce|first=Matt|date=September 27, 2014|work=|access-date=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been two case studies done in the United States that have revealed that police officers who have cameras have fewer encounters with citizens than officers who do not have cameras, due to fear of being reprimanded for committing a mistake.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Sousveillance cultures ==
In the era of web-based participatory media and convergence cultures, non-governmental and non-state actors, with their own virtual communities and networks that cut across national borders, use what Bakir (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Bakir, V. Sousveillance, Media and Strategic Political Communication: Iraq, USA, UK. Continuum: New York (2010). Available at: http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/sousveillance-media-and-strategic-political-communication-9780826430083/&lt;/ref&gt; calls the sousveillant assemblage to wield discursive power. The sousveillant assemblage comprises Haggerty &amp; Ericson's (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Haggerty, K.D. &amp; Ericson, R.V.  (2000).  The surveillant assemblage.  British Journal of Sociology, 51(4), 605-622.&lt;/ref&gt; surveillant assemblage (or loosely linked, unstable, systems of data flows of people's activities, tracked by computers, and data-mined so that we are each reconfigured as (security) risks or (commercial) opportunities, but data-fattened by the proliferation of web-based participatory media and personal sousveillance that we willingly provide online).

Features of sousveillance cultures:
* Dissent, and holding power-holders to account, is easier 
Undoubtedly, the urge and practice of dissent has always been with us, and people exploit the participatory media technologies at hand to mark and spread their dissent.{{Citation needed|reason=Unverifiable opinion|date=August 2015}} However, the rise of web-based participatory media and sousveillance cultures have made it easier for many more to record and spread this dissent globally, unimpeded by traditional media's commercial distribution restrictions such as pre-defined circulation runs or paid-for airtime, or the need for expert knowledge in media production. Mann has long maintained that the 'informal nature of sousveillance, with its tendency to distribute recordings widely, will often expose inappropriate use to scrutiny, whereas the secret nature of surveillance will tend to prevent misuse from coming to light' (Mann, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;641).&lt;ref&gt;Mann S. (2005). Sousveillance and cyberglogs. A 30-year empirical voyage through ethical, legal and policy issues. Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 14(6), 625–646.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Just as Foucault's Panopticon operates through potential or implied surveillance, so sousveillance might also operate through the credible threat of its existence. As the ubiquity and awareness of sousveillance widens, it is this that may most empower citizens – by making officials realise that their actions may, themselves, be monitored and exposed at any time. The permanent potential for sousveillance from so many (as opposed to more formalised exposés at the hands of investigative reporters, a small media elite) raises the likelihood that power abuses will be captured on record which can then be used to hold power-abusers and manipulators to account, providing of course, that there is a functioning legal system and/or public sphere (with mechanisms in place to translate popular demands and moral outrage into real-world change). 
* Emancipation, resistance and social change are unpredictable.
In the case of police body camera implementation in the US, there are multiple responses and social implications to this form of sousveillance. The case against police brutality and the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement has garnered an immense and impassioned following in a very short amount of time. There are two different social movements that have arisen in response to police body cameras. One school of thought that has manifested support is that police body cameras are necessary in fighting and ending police brutality. The other is the opposing stance to this one that raises the issue of privacy that police body cameras may violate. There have not been many case studies that have taken place in implementing police body cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Will the widespread use of police body cameras improve police accountability?|last=Scheindlin|first=Shira A.|publisher=Peter K. Manning|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that police worn body cameras have not been proven as a definite method to solve the problem of police brutality.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/12/do-police-body-cameras-work-ferguson/383323/|title=Do Police Body Cameras Actually Work?|last=Friedman|first=Uri|date=December 3, 2014|work=|access-date=|via=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have also shown that people, both policemen and civilians, act differently when they are aware that they are being surveilled on camera.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This leaves a lot of room for unpredictability surrounding the consequences of the use of this form of sousveillance.

In Mann's original conception, sousveillance had an emancipatory political thrust, with hierarchical sousveillance a conscious act of resistance to surveillance. Yet, the nature of the social change generated is unpredictable, and dependent on the sousveillant content, the context of its subsequent sharing, and, of course, the strength of the traditions of deliberation for democratic purposes. [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]' use of sousveillance, then, may result in social change, but not in a progressive fashion.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}
* Sousveillers' anonymity is crucial.
Given the lack of secrecy inherent in placing sousveillant content online, the anonymity of the sousveillers is of prime importance if hierarchical (politically or legally motivated) sousveillance is to proliferate. There is a real need for spaces online that are willing to protect users' anonymity and keep their subversive content online despite political or corporate pressure. With this sort of situation in mind, whistle-blowing web sites have been set up that guarantee anonymity, such as Wiki-leaks, launched in December 2006. More such sites are needed.
* Agenda-building power comes from the searchable and recirculated, semi-permanent, eyewitness archive.
Social media provide what could be described as a semi-permanent, and easily accessible, database of eyewitness accounts. Given that the web can be used and searched in the manner of a database to find examples of sousveillance; and given the recirculation of sousveillant footage in memes and in mainstream media, ever-hungry for new content in a media environment of convergence and expanding capacity, the longevity of sousveillant footage is perhaps what gives sousveillance its agenda-building power. It allows journalists, citizens, activists, insurgents, strategic communicators and researchers the opportunity to discover and partially relive both the eye-witnessed, sousveillant account, and the discourse surrounding specific moments of sousveillance, as well as reflecting on, and marshalling, their significance.

Invisibility/Aposematic Suit, S. Mann, 2001, is a wearable art piece that has two modes of operation: it either (1) becomes "transparent", suggestive of a [[chameleon]]'s invisibility cloak (to hide from predators).&lt;ref name="MannNolanWellman"&gt;[https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/surveillance-and-society/article/view/3344 "Sousveillance: Inventing and Using Wearable Computing Devices...] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325090745/http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/articles1(3)/sousveillance.pdf |date=2009-03-25 }}", by Steve Mann, Jason Nolan and Barry Wellman, in Surveillance &amp; Society 1(3), 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In this mode of operation the video displays show what is behind the wearer, as if we can see through the wearer from both front and back; or

A potential attacker, whether approaching the wearer from the front, or sneaking up behind the wearer, sees themselves displayed on the aposematic suit, in a manner similar to the way that department stores often place large video displays of their surveillance camera feed at the entrance to let potential shoplifters know they are being watched.&lt;ref name=MannNolanWellman/&gt;

Other similar projects include the work of Shinseungback Kimyonghun: "[the] Aposematic Jacket is a wearable computer for self-defense. The lenses on the jacket give off the warning signal, " ... I can record you"..., to prevent possible attack. When the wearer pushes a button under threat, the jacket records the scene in 360 degrees and sends the images to the Web."

== In fiction ==
David Brin's 1989 novel ''[[Earth (Brin novel)|Earth]]'' portrays citizens equipped with both augmented reality gear ("Tru-Vu Goggles") and cameras exercising reciprocal accountability, with each other and with authority figures, discussing effects on crime and presaging today's "cop cam" developments. Elites are allowed only temporary, cached secrecy. In Robert Sawyer's [[Neanderthal Parallax]] trilogy, the [[Homo neanderthalensis]] occupying a parallel universe have what are called companion implants. These are comprehensive recording and transmission devices, mounted in the forearm of each person. Their entire life is constantly monitored and sent to their alibi archive, a repository of recordings that are only accessible by their owner, or by the proper authorities when investigating an infraction, and in the latter case only in circumstances relevant to the investigation. Recordings are maintained after death; it is not made clear what the reasoning is for this and under what circumstances and or by whom a deceased person's archive can be accessed.

The plot of the 1995 movie ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'' is based on a future where sousveillance recordings are made and sold as entertainment. The plot of the movie revolves around the murder of a celebrity by police officers that is recorded by a person secretly wearing one of the devices. In the movie, the recordings are made by a flat array of sensors that pick up signals from the brain stem. The sensors are usually hidden under a wig, and they record everything the person wearing them sees and hears. Recordings made while the person making them dies are called "blackjack" tapes.

The plot of the 1985 [[John Crowley]] short story ''[[Snow (Crowley short story)|Snow]]'' revolves around a suspended camera recording the whole of a subject's life being sold as a consumer product.

The 2007 novel ''[[Halting State]]'' by [[Charles Stross]] and its sequel ''[[Rule 34 (novel)|Rule 34]]'' depict a 2020s Scotland in which wearable computing has a level of ubiquity similar to that of 2013's cell phones. The implications of a society in which anyone might be recording anything at any time are explored at length, particularly with respect to policing.

The [[open source]] science fiction role-playing game ''[[Eclipse Phase]]'' has sousveillance as a common part of life in the setting, as a result of data storage technology and high definition digital cameras becoming commonplace and often integrated into any and all objects.

== Sousveillance efficiency or efficacy ==
There is a need for efficacy, efficiency or effectiveness of sousveillance,
which can be met by social media, such as through widespread dissemination on social media, and when  used as an output modality in conjunction with sousveillance as an input modality,
is called "swollag", or [[gallows]] spelled backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Steve, and Joseph Ferenbok. "New media and the power politics of sousveillance in a surveillance-dominated world." Surveillance &amp; Society 11, no. 1/2 (2013): 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Janet, ed. Wearable Technology and Mobile Innovations for Next-Generation Education. IGI Global, 2016.  Page 115, in Chapter 6, Wearable Cameras, Alessio Drivet, University of Turin, Italy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mehdi Khosrow-Pour, DBA; Steve Clarke; Murray E. Jennex; Annie Becker; and Ari-Veikko Anttiroiko, Wearable Technologies: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications, IGI Publishing Hershey, PA, USA 2018, Page 509, ISBN:152255484X 9781522554844&lt;/ref&gt; For example, filming or streaming an abusive situation, like police abuse, doesn't always lead to justice and punishment of the abuser without some means (i.e. swollag) for sousveillance to take effect.  For example, in 2014, a man named [[Eric Garner]] was choked to death by a police officer in Staten Island after being arrested on suspicion of selling loose cigarettes.  "Garner's death was documented by his friend Ramsey Orta, and the video was widely disseminated. Despite the video evidence, a grand jury declined to indict Garner's killer, leading to widespread outrage and protest. (In an ironic twist, the only person indicted in connection with Garner's death was Orta, who came under police scrutiny and was arrested on an "unrelated" weapons possession charge. Orta is now in prison in New York. Sousveillance is not without its costs.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601878/why-we-must-continue-to-turn-the-camera-on-police/|title=How citizen surveillance could reform a broken American police system|last=Zuckerman|first=Ethan|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it appeared that a filmed abusive behavior is more likely to be punished if the video is widely spread. This makes sousveillance more efficient and politically meaningful , insofar it shows to a significant proportion of the population the abuses of the authority. Thus, the development of video platforms, like Youtube and Snapchat, and streaming platforms like Periscope and Twitch, are key components to sousveillance's efficiency. This was shown during French demonstrations against the "Loi Travail" in 2016, during which a Periscope stream showing authority forces, called abusive by one part of the demonstrants, was watched by 93,362 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La sousveillance. Vers un renseignement ordinaire ?|last=Alloing|first=Camille|publisher=Hermès|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=68–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This video was posted on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Twitter|id=NorthScope518/status/742759328235573248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it can be considered whether this creates a dangerous dependence on private platforms, often ruled by Internet giants (like Google, for YouTube) which have common interests with governments, and who adapt their content through algorithms users don't have control on.

In addition, some argue that sousveillance may aid in state surveillance, despite being conducted by the people. Examples include [[Mobile app|mobile apps]] used to help people signal public threats, such as the Israeli app c-Now (previously known as Reporty). In January 2018, c-Now was tested in [[Nice]] by mayor [[Christian Estrosi]], sparking virulent public debates, with security advocates reporting spyware associated with the app&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.numerama.com/politique/322446-application-reporty-la-mairie-de-nice-va-demander-le-retrait-des-mouchards-dans-son-application.html|title=Application Reporty : la Mairie de Nice va demander le retrait des mouchards dans son application - Politique - Numerama|last=Durand|first=Corentin|date=2018-01-18|work=Numerama|access-date=2018-03-19|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the director of c-Now is [[Ehud Barak|Ehud Barack]], former prime minister of Israel, who is suspected to have kept close links with Israeli and American governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nicematin.com/vie-locale/cinq-questions-pour-tout-savoir-sur-reporty-la-nouvelle-appli-securite-qui-fait-polemique-a-nice-200902|title=Cinq questions pour tout savoir sur Reporty, la nouvelle appli sécurité qui fait polémique à Nice|date=2018-01-20|work=Nice-Matin|access-date=2018-03-19|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, security advocates consider the app to serve America's global surveillance program (revealed by [[Edward Snowden]] in 2013), and raise the question of whether sousveillance really serves as "inverse surveillance".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8327">The '''St Albans Press''' was the third [[printing press]] set up in England, in 1479. It was situated in the [[Abbey Gateway, St. Albans|Abbey Gateway, St Albans]], a part of the [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] Monastery of [[St Albans Cathedral|St Albans]]. The name of the printer is unknown, only referred to by [[Wynkyn de Worde]] in a reprinting of one of the St Albans books as 'Sometime schoolmaster'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/bibliographyofpr02bigmrich |title=A bibliography of printing : with notes and illustrations : Bigmore, E. C. (Edward Clements), 1838?-1899 |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has sometimes been identified as John Marchall, master of [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St Albans School]]; however, a passage written by Worde in 1497 implies that the printer was deceased, and Marchall is known to have lived until 1501. Recent research has produced the name John Haule as a possible candidate for the Schoolmaster Printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Debbie White |url=http://www.hertsad.co.uk/news/education/st_albans_school_solves_mystery_of_whereabouts_of_lost_centuries_old_latin_book_1_4848854 |title=St Albans School solves ‘mystery’ of whereabouts of lost centuries-old Latin book - Education - Herts Advertiser |website=Hertsad.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented the school with its first printed textbook, the ''[[Agostino Dati#The Elegantiolae|Elegantiolae]]'', which was the first book printed at the press, and he was a printer, probably in St Albans in 1479.

However, the historian [[Nicholas Orme]], in his “Medieval Schools, From Roman Britain to Renaissance England”, states, “Books were also acquired by schools and institutions. One of the earliest known is a ''Priscian Major'' [the first sixteen books of [[Priscian]]'s Latin grammar, the ''Institutiones grammaticae''] given to St Albans school by John Haule, apparently before 1310." Orme was citing the register of the abbots of St Albans: “Item, Johannes Haule praedictis Scolis dedit Priscianum magnum.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Thomas Riley, editor, Chronica Monasterii S. Albani, Registra Quorundam Abbatam Monasterii S. Albani, Qui Saeculo XVmo Floruere, Volume 2, Longman &amp; Co. London, 1873, page 314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Orme, Medieval Schools, From Roman Britain to Renaissance England, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2006, page 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Schoolmaster Printer of St Albans|author=Charles Ashdown|date=1908|url=http://www.stalbanshistory.org/documents/1924_07_.pdf|format=PDF|website=Stalbanshistory.org|accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lotte Hellinga&lt;ref&gt;Lotte Hellinga, “William Caxton and early printing in England”, The British Library (2010), Chapter 11, The Press at St Albans (1479-81, 1486), pages 90-99&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that “there were several people working successively at the abbey.” Printing was done in St Albans in two distinct phases, probably by two printers or teams of printers. During the first phase, from 1479 to 1481, they printed six books in Latin for grammar school and university students, with a high standard of typesetting and printing. Then there was an interval of five years, after which printing resumed in 1486. During the second phase, they printed two books in English for a more general audience, with a lower standard of technical skill. 

One possible candidate for the Schoolmaster Printer is William Waren.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Printing Historical Society, New Series, No. 24, Summer 2016, “Printers, stationers and bookbinders in the plea rolls of the Court of Common Pleas, 1460-1540”, by Vance Mead, pages 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; He was identified as William Waren, Master of Grammar and warden of the Grammar School of St Albans in a case in Common Pleas recorded from 1486 to 1489. He was the plaintiff against the [[William of Wallingford|Abbot of St Albans]] for a debt of 36 pounds. William Waren was awarded Master of Grammar at Cambridge in 1468-9. In his will, written in February and proven in March 1489/90, he requests to be buried in the nave of the Abbey church. 

There was another printer active in St Albans in the 1530s.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid page 16&lt;/ref&gt; In cases in Common Pleas in 1535, he is recorded as Richard Baugh, of St Albans, printer, and as Richard Baugh alias Waters, of St Albans, stationer.

'''Sunless tanning''', also known as '''UV filled tanning''', '''self tanning''', '''spray tanning''' (when applied [[topical]]ly), or '''fake tanning''', refers to the application of chemicals to the skin to produce an effect similar in appearance to a [[sun tanning|suntan]]. The popularity of sunless tanning has risen since the 1960s after health authorities confirmed links between [[UV]] exposure (from sunlight or [[tanning bed]]s) and the incidence of [[skin cancer]].

Since [[sunscreen]] absorbs [[ultraviolet]] light and prevents it from reaching the skin, it will prevent tanning. It has been reported that sunscreen with a [[sun protection factor]] (SPF) of 8 based on the [[UVB]] spectrum can decrease [[vitamin D]] synthetic capacity by 95 percent, whereas sunscreen with an SPF of 15 can reduce synthetic capacity by 98 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Carotenaemia]] (xanthaemia) is the presence in blood of the yellow pigment carotene from excessive intake of carrots or other vegetables containing the pigment resulting in increased serum carotenoids. It can lead to subsequent yellow-orange discoloration (xanthoderma or carotenoderma) and their subsequent deposition in the outermost layer of skin. Carotenemia and carotenoderma is in itself harmless, and does not require treatment. In primary carotenoderma, when the use of high quantities of carotene is discontinued the skin color will return to normal. It may take up to several months, however, for this to happen.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Lycopene===
[[Lycopene]] is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of beta-carotene and xanthophylls.

Lycopene may be the most powerful carotenoid quencher of [[singlet oxygen]].&lt;ref name="Di Mascio Kaiser Sies 1989 pp. 532–538"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Di Mascio |first=Paolo |last2=Kaiser |first2=Stephan |last3=Sies |first3=Helmut |title=Lycopene as the most efficient biological carotenoid singlet oxygen quencher |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |publisher=Elsevier BV |volume=274 |issue=2 |year=1989 |issn=0003-9861 |doi=10.1016/0003-9861(89)90467-0 |pages=532–538 |oclc=4922826134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its strong color and non-toxicity, lycopene is a useful [[food coloring]] (registered as '''E160d''') and is approved for usage in the USA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=73.585|title=21CFR73.585|last=|first=|date=|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov|series=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927063849/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=73.585|archive-date=2006-09-27|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and New Zealand (registered as '''160d''')&lt;ref&gt;Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011C00827 |title=Standard 1.2.4 - Labelling of ingredients |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the EU.&lt;ref&gt;UK Food Standards Agency: {{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist |title=Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beta-carotene===
Sunless-tanning pills often contain [[beta-carotene|β-carotene]]. The [[American Cancer Society]] states that "Although the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has approved some of these additives for coloring food, they are not approved for use in tanning agents." Also that "They may be harmful at the high levels that are used in tanning pills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/skin-cancer/prevention-and-early-detection/tanning-pills-and-products.html|title=Tanning pills and accelerators|access-date=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Chronic, high doses of synthetic β-carotene supplements have been associated with increased rate of [[lung cancer]] among those who smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tanvetyanon T, Bepler G |title=Beta-carotene in multivitamins and the possible risk of lung cancer among smokers versus former smokers: a meta-analysis and evaluation of national brands |journal=Cancer |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=150–7 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18429004 |doi=10.1002/cncr.23527 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canthaxanthin===
[[Canthaxanthin]] is most commonly used as a color additive in certain foods. Although the FDA has approved the use of canthaxanthin in food, it does not approve its use as a tanning agent. When used as a color additive, only very small amounts of canthaxanthin are necessary. As a tanning agent, however, much larger quantities are used. After canthaxanthin is consumed, it is deposited throughout the body, including in the layer of fat below the skin, which turns an orange-brown color. These types of tanning pills have been linked to various side effects, including [[hepatitis]] and canthaxanthin [[retinopathy]], a condition in which yellow deposits form in the retina of the eye. Other side effects including damage to the digestive system and skin surface have also been noted.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The FDA withdrew approval for use of canthaxanthin as a tanning agent, and has issued warnings concerning its use.&lt;ref name="US FDA/CFSAN - Tanning Pills"/&gt;

==Other agents==

===DHA-based products===
DHA ([[Dihydroxyacetone]], also known as glycerone) is not a dye, stain or paint, but causes a chemical reaction with the [[amino acids]] in the dead layer on the skin surface. One of the pathways is a free radical-mediated Maillard reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Namiki |first1=Mitsuo |last2=Hayashi |first2=Tateki |year=1983 |chapter=A New Mechanism of the Maillard Reaction Involving Sugar Fragmentation and Free Radical Formation |pages=21–46 |doi=10.1021/bk-1983-0215.ch002 |title=The Maillard Reaction in Foods and Nutrition |volume=215 |series=ACS Symposium Series |isbn=0-8412-0769-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.01448.x | title = In Vivo Formation of Maillard Reaction Free Radicals in Mouse Skin | year = 2001 | last1 = Lloyd | first1 = Roger V | last2 = Fong | first2 = Anna J | last3 = Sayre | first3 = Robert M | journal = Journal of Investigative Dermatology | volume = 117 | issue = 3 | pages = 740–2 | pmid = 11564185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other pathway is the conventional [[Maillard reaction]], a process well known to food chemists that causes the browning that occurs during food manufacturing and storage. It does not involve the underlying [[skin pigmentation]] nor does it require exposure to [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] to initiate the color change. However, for the 24 hours after self-tanner is applied, the skin is especially susceptible to ultraviolet, according to a 2007 study led by Katinka Jung of the Gematria Test Lab in Berlin.&lt;ref name=pmid18024196&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jung K, Seifert M, Herrling T, Fuchs J |title=UV-generated free radicals (FR) in skin: their prevention by sunscreens and their induction by self-tanning agents |journal=Spectrochimica Acta. Part A, Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=1423–8 | date=May  2008 |pmid=18024196 |doi=10.1016/j.saa.2007.09.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty minutes after the researchers treated skin samples with high levels of DHA they found that more than 180 percent additional free radicals formed during sun exposure compared with untreated skin. Another self-tanner ingredient, [[erythrulose]], produced a similar response at high levels. For a day after self-tanner application, excessive sun exposure should be avoided and sunscreen should be worn outdoors, they say; an antioxidant cream could also minimize free radical production. Although some self-tanners contain sunscreen, its effect will not last long after application, and a fake tan itself will not protect the skin from UV exposure.
The study by Jung et al. further confirms earlier results demonstrating that dihydroxyacetone in combination with dimethylisosorbide enhances the process of (sun-based) tanning. This earlier study also found that dihydroxyacetone also has an effect on the amino acids and nucleic acids which is bad for the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Benamar N, Laplante AF, Lahjomri F, Leblanc RM |date=Oct 2004 | title = Modulated photoacoustic spectroscopy study of an artificial tanning on human skin induced by dihydroxyacetone | url = | journal = Physiological Measurement | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 1199–210 | doi = 10.1088/0967-3334/25/5/010 | pmid = 15535185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free radicals are due to the action of UV light on AGE ([[advanced glycation end-products]]) as a result of the reaction of DHA with the skin, and the intermediates, such as [[Amadori product]]s (a type of AGE), that lead to them. AGEs are behind the damage to the skin that occurs with high blood sugar in diabetes where similar glycation occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oak J, Nakagawa K, Miyazawa T |title=Synthetically prepared Aamadori-glycated phosphatidylethanolaminecan trigger lipid peroxidation via free radical reactions |journal=FEBS Letters |volume=481 |issue=1 |pages=26–30 | date=September  2000 |pmid=10984609 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(00)01966-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; AGEs absorb and provide a little protection against some of the damaging factors of UV (up to SPF 3),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Faurschou A, Wulf HC |title=Durability of the sun protection factor provided by dihydroxyacetone |journal=Photodermatology, Photoimmunology &amp; Photomedicine |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=239–42 | date=October  2004 |pmid=15379873 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0781.2004.00118.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Petersen AB, Na R, Wulf HC |title=Sunless skin tanning with dihydroxyacetone delays broad-spectrum ultraviolet photocarcinogenesis in hairless mice |journal=Mutation Research |volume=542 |issue=1–2 |pages=129–38 | date=December  2003 |pmid=14644361 |doi=10.1016/j.mrgentox.2003.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they do not have melanin's extended electronic structure that dissipates the energy, so part of it goes towards starting free radical chain reactions instead, in which other AGEs participate readily. Overall tanner enhances free radical injury.&lt;ref name=pmid18024196/&gt;
Although some self-tanners contain sunscreen, its effect will not last as long as the tan. The stated SPF is only applicable for a few hours after application. Despite darkening of the skin, an individual is still susceptible to UV rays, therefore an overall sun protection is still very necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dermnetnz.org/treatments/dihydroxyacetone.html/ |title=Dihydroxyacetone, tanning cream, sunless tanning. DermNet NZ |publisher=Dermnetnz.org |date=2015-08-29 |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be some inhibition of vitamin D production in DHA-treated skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Armas LA, Fusaro RM, Sayre RM, Huerter CJ, Heaney RP |title=Do melanoidins induced by topical 9% dihydroxyacetone sunless tanning spray inhibit vitamin d production?

The color effect is temporary and fades gradually over 3 to 10 days. Some of these products also use [[erythrulose]] which works identically to DHA, but develops more slowly. Both DHA and erythrulose have been known to cause [[contact dermatitis]].

Professional spray tan applications are available from spas, salons and gymnasiums by both hand-held sprayers and in the form of sunless or UV-Free spray booths. Spray tan applications are also available through online retail distribution channels and are widely available to purchase for in home use.&lt;ref name="prod info"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductandIngredientSafety/ProductInformation/ucm134064.htm FDA Comments on Sunless Tanners and Bronzers]&lt;/ref&gt; The enclosed booth, which resembles an enclosed shower stall, sprays the tanning solution over the entire body. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) states when using DHA-containing products as an all-over spray or mist in a commercial spray "tanning" booth, it may be difficult to avoid exposure in a manner for which DHA is not approved, including the area of the eyes, lips, or mucous membrane, or even internally. DHA is not approved by the FDA for inhalation.&lt;ref name="prod info" /&gt;

An opinion&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_048.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; issued by the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, concluding spray tanning with DHA did not pose risk, has been heavily criticized by specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/safety-popular-spray-tans-question-protected/story?id=16542918&amp;page=4 |title=Safety of Popular 'Spray On' Tans in Question; Are You Protected? - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2012-06-12 |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the cosmetics industry in Europe chose the evidence to review, according to the commission itself. Thus, nearly every report the commission's eventual opinion referenced came from studies that were never published or peer-reviewed and, in the majority of cases, were performed by companies or industry groups linked to the manufacturing of DHA. The industry left out nearly all of the peer-reviewed studies published in publicly available scientific journals that identified DHA as a potential mutagen. A study by scientists from the Department of Dermatology, Bispebjerg Hospital, published in [[Mutation Research (journal)|Mutation Research]] has concluded DHA 'induces DNA damage, cell-cycle block and apoptosis' in cultured cells.&lt;ref name="deepdyve.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/elsevier/dihydroxyacetone-the-active-browning-ingredient-in-sunless-tanning-UtUd1Dv207 |title=Dihydroxyacetone, the active browning ingredient in sunless tanning lotions, induces DNA damage, cell-cycle block and apoptosis in cultured HaCaT keratinocytes |publisher=DeepDyve |date=2004-06-13 |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SIK-inhibitors ===
A novel class of compounds has been found to stimulate [[melanogenesis]] in a mechanism that is independent from [[α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] (α-MSH) activation of the [[melanocortin 1 receptor]] (MC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor). This is accomplished via small molecule inhibition of salt-inducible kinases (SIK). Inhibition of SIK increases transcription of MITF which is known to increase [[melanin]] production. Work published in Cell Reports in June 2017 by Mujahid et al. from [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] Department of Dermatology has demonstrated compounds that have efficacy when applied topically to human skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mujahid|first=Nisma|last2=Liang|first2=Yanke|last3=Murakami|first3=Ryo|last4=Choi|first4=Hwan Geun|last5=Dobry|first5=Allison S.|last6=Wang|first6=Jinhua|last7=Suita|first7=Yusuke|last8=Weng|first8=Qing Yu|last9=Allouche|first9=Jennifer|date=2017-06-13|title=A UV-Independent Topical Small-Molecule Approach for Melanin Production in Human Skin|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.05.042|journal=Cell Reports|language=English|volume=19|issue=11|pages=2177–2184|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2017.05.042|issn=2211-1247}}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds are still however in pre-clinical stages of development. Future directions may include the incorporation of SIK-inhibitor compounds with traditional UV-blocking sunscreens to minimize UV-related DNA damage in the short term while providing longer term protection through endogenous melanin production.

=== Tyrosine-based products ===
Tanning accelerators—lotions or pills&lt;ref name="US FDA/CFSAN - Tanning Pills"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductandIngredientSafety/ProductInformation/ucm134217.htm US FDA/CFSAN - Tanning Pills]&lt;/ref&gt; that usually contain the amino acid [[tyrosine]]—claim that they stimulate and increase [[melanin]] formation, thereby accelerating the tanning process. These are used in conjunction with UV exposure. At this time, there is no scientific data available to support these claims.

===Melanotan peptide hormones===
The role of [[alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone|alpha-melnocyte-stimulating hormone]] (α-MSH) in promoting melanin diffusion has been known since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=BI|title=The role of melanin-concentrating hormone in color change.|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=31 May 1993|volume=680|pages=279-89|pmid=8390154}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, scientists at University of Arizona began attempting to develop α-MSH and analogs as potential sunless tanning agents, and synthesized and tested several analogs, including [[afamelanotide]], then called melanotan-I.&lt;ref name=HadleyDorr2006/&gt;

To pursue the tanning agent, melanotan-I was licensed by Competitive Technologies, a [[technology transfer]] company operating on behalf of University of Arizona, to an Australian startup called Epitan,&lt;ref name=PL2004&gt;{{cite news|title=EpiTan focuses on Melanotan, a potential blockbuster|url=https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/epitan-focuses-on-melanotan-a-potential-blockbuster|work=The Pharma Letter|date=1 November 2004|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HadleyDorr2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hadley|first1=ME|last2=Dorr|first2=RT|title=Melanocortin peptide therapeutics: historical milestones, clinical studies and commercialization.|journal=Peptides|date=April 2006|volume=27|issue=4|pages=921-30|doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2005.01.029|pmid=16412534}}&lt;/ref&gt; which changed its name to Clinuvel in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Epitan changes name to Clinuvel, announces new clinical program|url=http://www.labonline.com.au/content/life-scientist/news/epitan-changes-name-to-clinuvel-announces-new-clinical-program-161764385|work=LabOnline|date=27 February 2006|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other melanogenesis stimulants===
{{Main|Melanogenesis#Stimulations}}
[[Eicosanoid]]s, [[retinoids]], [[oestrogen]]s, [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]], [[endothelin]]s, [[psoralens]], [[hydantoin]], [[forskolin]], [[cholera toxin]], [[isobutylmethylxanthine]], [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]] analogues, and UV irradiation all trigger melanogenesis and, in turn, pigmentation.

===Temporary bronzers===
Bronzers are a temporary sunless tanning or bronzing option. These come in powders, sprays, mousse, gels, lotions and moisturizers. Once applied, they create a tan that can easily be removed with soap and water. Like make-up, these products tint or stain a person's skin only until they are washed off.

They are often used for "one-day" only tans, or to complement a DHA-based sunless tan. Many formulations are available, and some have limited sweat or light water resistance. If applied under clothing, or where fabric and skin edges meet, most will create some light but visible rub-off. Dark clothing prevents the rub-off from being noticeable. While these products are much safer than tanning beds, the color produced can sometimes look orangey and splotchy if applied incorrectly.

A recent trend is that of lotions or moisturizers containing a gradual tanning agent. A slight increase in color is usually observable after the first use, but color will continue to darken the more the product is used.

Air brush tanning is a spray on tan performed by a professional. An air brush tan can last five to ten days and will fade when the skin is washed. It is used for special occasions or to get a quick dark tan. At-home airbrush tanning kits and aerosol mists are also available.

===Risks===
Tanners usually contain a [[sunscreen]]. However, when avobenzone is irradiated with UVA light, it generates a triplet excited state in the keto form which can either cause the avobenzone to degrade or transfer energy to biological targets and cause deleterious effects.&lt;ref name="Paris2009"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UV-A light in a day of sunlight in a temperate climate is sufficient to break down most of the compound. It's important to continue wearing SPF while self-tanning, as self-tanner is generally a fake and temporary tan, and your skin is still sensitive to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://99centrazor.com/self-tanner-tips/|title=Self Tanner Tips to Keep Your Tan Alive in the Fall {{!}} 99 Cent Razor|date=2017-09-29|work=99CentRazor|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If avobenzone-containing sunscreen is applied on top of tanner, the photosensitizer effect magnifies the free-radical damage promoted by DHA, as DHA may make the skin especially susceptible to free-radical damage from sunlight, according to a 2007 study led by Katinka Jung of the Gematria Test Lab in Berlin.&lt;ref name=pmid18024196/&gt; Forty minutes after the researchers treated skin samples with 20% DHA they found that more than 180 percent additional free radicals formed during sun exposure compared with untreated skin.

A toxicologist and lung specialist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine (Dr. Rey Panettieri) has commented, "The reason I'm concerned is the deposition of the tanning agents into the lungs could really facilitate or aid systemic absorption -- that is, getting into the bloodstream. These compounds in some cells could actually promote the development of cancers or malignancies, and if that's the case then we need to be wary of them."&lt;ref name="Greenblatt Ahuja 2012"&gt;{{cite web | last=Greenblatt | first=Mark | last2=Ahuja | first2=Gitika | title=Are 'Spray-On' Tans Safe?

'''Wood gas''' is a [[syngas]] fuel which can be used as a fuel for furnaces, stoves and vehicles in place of [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] or other fuels. During the production process [[biomass]] or other carbon-containing materials are [[gasification|gasified]] within the oxygen-limited environment of a [[wood gas generator]] to produce [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]]. These gases can then be burnt as a fuel within an oxygen rich environment to produce [[carbon dioxide]], [[water]] and heat. In some gasifiers this process is preceded by [[pyrolysis]], where the biomass or coal is first converted to [[char]], releasing [[methane]] and [[tar]] rich in [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s.

== History ==
[[File:Petrol Substitutes in USE For Public Transport in Leeds, England C 1943 D15675.jpg|thumb|right|A bus, powered by wood gas generated by a gassifier on a trailer, Leeds, England c.1943]] 
The first wood gasifier was apparently built by [[Gustav Bischof]] in 1839. The first vehicle powered by wood gas was built by [[Thomas Hugh Parker]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Thomas Hugh Parker | url = http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/genealogy/Parker/ThomasHughParker.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 1900, many cities delivered [[syngas]] (centrally produced, typically from [[coal]]) to residences. [[Natural gas]] began to be used only in 1930.

Wood gas vehicles were used during [[World War II]] as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels. In Germany alone, around 500,000 "[[producer gas]]" vehicles were in use at the end of the war.  Trucks, buses, tractors, motorcycles, ships and trains were equipped with a wood gasification unit. In 1942, when wood gas had not yet reached the height of its popularity, there were about 73,000 wood gas vehicles in Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;Ekerholm, Helena. 'Cultural Meanings of Wood Gas as Automobile Fuel in Sweden, 1930-1945'. In Past and Present energy Societies: How Energy Connects Politics, Technologies and Cultures, edited by Nina Möllers and Karin Zachmann. Bielefeld: Transcript verlag, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 65,000 in France, 10,000 in Denmark, and almost 8,000 in Switzerland. In 1944, Finland had 43,000 "woodmobiles", of which 30,000 were buses and trucks, 7,000 private vehicles, 4,000 tractors and 600 boats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/01/wood-gas-cars.html Wood gas vehicles: firewood in the fuel tank] Low-tech Magazine, January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood gasifiers are still manufactured in China and Russia for automobiles and as power generators for industrial applications. Trucks retrofitted with wood gasifiers are used in [[North Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/how-north-korea-fuels-its-military-trucks-with-trees/|title=How North Korea Fuels Its Military Trucks With Trees|author=David Wogan|publisher=Scientific American|date=January 2, 2013|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in rural areas, particularly on the roads of the east coast.

== Usage ==
===Internal combustion engine ===
[[Image:Wood gasifier on epa tractor.jpg|thumb|A [[Wood gas generator]] fitted to a Ford truck converted, into a tractor, Per Larsen Tractor Museum, Sweden, 2003]]
[[File:Planet Mechanics wood gasifier.png|thumb|right|Wood gasifier system]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-V00670, Berlin, Pkw mit Holzgasantrieb.jpg|thumb|right|A wood-gas powered car, Berlin, 1946. Note the secondary radiator, required to cool the gas before it's introduced into the engine]]
Wood gasifiers can power either spark ignition engines, where all of the normal fuel can be replaced with little change to the carburation, or in a Diesel engine, feeding the gas into the air inlet that is modified to have a throttle valve, if it didn't have it already. On Diesel engines the Diesel fuel is still needed to ignite the gas mixture, so a mechanically regulated Diesel engine's "stop" linkage and probably "throttle" linkage must be modified to always give the engine a little bit of injected fuel, often under the standard idle per-injection volume. Wood can be used to power cars with ordinary [[internal combustion engine]]s if a [[Wood gas generator|wood gasifier]] is attached. This was quite popular during World War II in several European, African and Asian countries, because the war prevented easy and cost-effective access to oil. In more recent times, wood gas has been suggested as a clean and efficient method to heat and cook in developing countries, or even to produce electricity when combined with an internal combustion engine. Compared to World War II technology, gasifiers have become less dependent on constant attention due to the use of sophisticated electronic control systems, but it remains difficult to get clean gas from them. Purification of the gas and feeding it into natural gas pipelines is one variant to link it to the existing refueling infrastructure. Liquefaction by the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] is another possibility.

Efficiency of the gasifier system is relatively high. The gasification stage converts about 75% of fuel energy content into a combustible gas that can be used as a fuel for internal combustion engines. Based on long-term practical experiments and over {{convert|100000|km|mi}} driven with a wood gas-powered car, the energy consumption has been 1.54 times higher compared to the energy demand of the same car on petrol, excluding the energy needed to extract, transport and refine the oil from which petrol is derived, and excluding the energy to harvest, process, and transport the wood to feed the gasifier. This means that {{convert|1000|kg|lb}} of wood combustible matter has been found to be equivalent to {{convert|365|l|gal}} of petrol during real transportation in similar driving conditions and with the same, otherwise unmodified, vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mikkonen |first= Vesa |title=Wood Gas for Mobile Applications |year= 2010 |publisher= Published by the author, available at www.ekomobiili.fi| pages= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be considered to be a good result, because no other refining of the fuel is required. This study also considers all possible losses of the wood gas system, like preheating of the system and carrying of the extra weight of the gas-generating system. In power generation, reported demand of fuel is {{convert|1.1|kg|lb}} wood combustible matter per kilowatt-hour of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mikkonen |first= Vesa |title=Wood Gas for Mobile Applications |year= 2010 |publisher= Published by the author, available at www.ekomobiili.fi| pages= 142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gasifiers have been built for remote Asian communities using rice hulls, which in many cases have no other use. One installation in Burma uses an 80&amp;nbsp;kW modified Diesel-powered electric generator for about 500 people who are otherwise without power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/135/ Burmese village rice husk gasifier]&lt;/ref&gt; The ash can be used as [[biochar]] fertilizer, so this can be considered a renewable fuel.

Exhaust gas emission from an internal combustion engine is significantly lower on wood gas than on petrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mikkonen |first= Vesa |title=Wood Gas for Mobile Applications |year= 2010 |publisher= Published by the author, available at www.ekomobiili.fi| pages= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially the hydrocarbon emissions are low on wood gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mikkonen |first= Vesa |title=Wood Gas for Mobile Applications |year= 2010 |publisher= Published by the author, available at www.ekomobiili.fi| pages= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A normal catalytic converter works well with wood gas, but even without it, emission levels less than 20 ppm HC and 0.2% CO can be easily achieved by most automobile engines. Combustion of wood gas generates no particulates, and the gas renders thus very little [[carbon black]] amongst motor oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mikkonen |first= Vesa |title=Wood Gas for Mobile Applications |year= 2010 |publisher= Published by the author, available at www.ekomobiili.fi| pages= 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stoves, cooking and furnaces ===
[[File:Wood gas stove Principle of operation.png|thumb|Coaxial downdraft gasification stove]]
Certain stove designs are, in effect, gasifiers working on the updraft principle:  The air passes up through the fuel, which can be a column of rice hulls, and is combusted, then reduced to carbon monoxide by the residual char on the surface.  The resulting gas is then burnt by heated secondary air coming up a concentric tube.  Such a device behaves very much like a gas stove. This arrangement is also known as a Chinese burner.

An alternative stove based on the down-draft principle and typically built with nested cylinders also provides high efficiency. Combustion from the top creates a gasification zone, with the gas escaping downwards through ports located at the base of the burner chamber. The gas mixes with additional incoming air to provide a secondary burn. Most of the CO produced by gasification is oxidized to {{CO2}} in the secondary combustion cycle; therefore, gasification stoves carry lower health risks than conventional cooking fires.

Another application is the use of producer gas to displace light density [[fuel oil]] (LDO) in industrial furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;Rajeev Jorapur and [[Anil K. Rajvanshi]], [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953497000147 Sugarcane leaf-bagasse gasifiers for industrial heating applications] [[Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute]], 11 April 1997, {{doi|10.1016/S0961-9534(97)00014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
[[Image:Holzvergaser_Güssing.jpg|thumb|Fluidized bed gasifier in [[Güssing]], [[Austria]], operated on wood chips]]
A wood gasifier takes wood chips, sawdust, charcoal, coal, rubber or similar materials as fuel and burns these incompletely in a fire box, producing wood gas, solid ash and [[soot]], the latter of which have to be removed periodically from the gasifier. The wood gas can then be filtered for tars and soot/ash particles, cooled and directed to an engine or [[fuel cell]].&lt;ref name="Nagel"&gt;[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these engines have strict purity requirements of the wood gas, so the gas often has to pass through extensive gas cleaning in order to remove or convert, ''i.e.'', "[[Cracking (chemistry)|crack]]", tars and particles. The removal of tar is often accomplished by using a water [[scrubber]]. Running wood gas in an unmodified gasoline-burning internal combustion engine may lead to problematic accumulation of unburned compounds.

The quality of the gas from different gasifiers varies a great deal. Staged gasifiers, where pyrolysis and gasification occur separately, instead of in the same reaction zone as was the case in, ''e.g.'', the World War II gasifiers, can be engineered to produce essentially tar-free gas (less than 1&amp;nbsp;mg/m³), while single-reactor fluid-bed gasifiers may exceed 50,000&amp;nbsp;mg/m³ tar. The fluid bed reactors have the advantage of being much more compact, with more capacity per unit volume and price.  Depending on the intended use of the gas, tar can be beneficial, as well by increasing the heating value of the gas.

The heat of combustion of "producer gas"&amp;nbsp;— a term used in the United States meaning wood gas produced for use in a combustion engine&amp;nbsp;— is rather low compared to other fuels. Taylor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first= Charles Fayette |title=Internal-Combustion Engine in Theory and Practice - Vol.1 |year= 1985 |publisher= The MIT Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 0-262-70027-1 | pages= 46–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that producer gas has a lower [[heat of combustion]] of  5.7 MJ/kg versus 55.9 MJ/kg for natural gas and 44.1 MJ/kg for gasoline. The heat of combustion of wood is typically 15-18 MJ/kg. Presumably, these values can vary somewhat from sample to sample.  The same source reports the following chemical composition by volume which most likely is also variable:
[[File:Nambassa 1981 Alt Energy centre Gas Producer Photographer Michael Bennetts.jpg|thumb|A charcoal gas producer at the [[Nambassa]] alternative festival in New Zealand in 1981]]
During the production of [[charcoal]] for [[blackpowder]], the volatile wood gas is vented.  Extremely-high-surface-area carbon results, suitable for use as a fuel in black powder.

* [[Nitrogen]] N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 50.9%
* Carbon monoxide CO: 27.0%
* [[Hydrogen]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 14.0%
* Carbon dioxide CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 4.5%
* [[Methane]] CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: 3.0%
* [[Oxygen]] O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 0.6%.

It is pointed out that the gas composition is strongly dependent on the gasification process, the gasification medium (air, oxygen or steam) and the fuel moisture. Steam-gasification processes typically yield high hydrogen contents, downdraft fixed bed gasifiers yield high nitrogen concentrations and low tar loads, while updraft fixed bed gasifiers yield high tar loads.&lt;ref name="Nagel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solar Technical Information Program"&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/old/3022.pdf Handbook of Biomass Downdraft Gasifier Engine Systems] (Section 5.2 paragraph 2, pg 30), prepared by the Solar Energy Research Institute, U.S. Department of Energy Solar Technical Information Program, Solar Energy Research Institute, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The reflector element is slightly longer than the driven dipole, whereas the directors are a little shorter.&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt; The parasitic elements absorb and reradiate the radio waves from the driven element with a different [[phase (waves)|phase]], modifying the dipole's [[radiation pattern]].  The waves from the multiple elements [[Superposition principle|superpose]] and [[interference (wave motion)|interfere]] to enhance radiation in a single direction, achieving a very substantial increase in the antenna's [[antenna gain|gain]] compared to a simple dipole.

Also called a "beam antenna",&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt; or "parasitic array", the Yagi is very widely used as a high-gain antenna on the [[high frequency|HF]], [[very high frequency|VHF]] and [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] bands.&lt;ref name="Balanis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt;   It has moderate to high [[antenna gain|gain]] which depends on the number of elements used, typically limited to about 20&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dBi]],&lt;ref name="Balanis" /&gt;  [[linear polarization]],&lt;ref name="Balanis" /&gt;  unidirectional (end-fire) beam pattern&lt;ref name="Balanis" /&gt;  with high [[front-to-back ratio]] of up to 20&amp;nbsp;db. and is lightweight, inexpensive and simple to construct.&lt;ref name="Balanis" /&gt;   The [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a Yagi antenna, the [[frequency]] range over which it has high gain, is narrow, a few percent of the center frequency, and decreases with increasing gain,&lt;ref name="Balanis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt; so it is often used in fixed-frequency applications.

== Origins ==

The antenna was invented in 1926 by [[Shintaro Uda]] of [[Tohoku University|Tohoku Imperial University]], [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="Uda1925" /&gt; with a lesser role played by his colleague [[Hidetsugu Yagi]].&lt;ref name="Yagi1926" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarkar"&gt;{{cite book | last1  = Sarkar | first1 = T.

However the "Yagi" name has become more familiar with the name of Uda often omitted. This appears to have been due to Yagi filing a patent on the idea in Japan without Uda's name in it, and later transferring the patent to the [[Marconi Company]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sm.rim.or.jp/~ymushiak/sub.hist.corner.htm###|title=Y.

Yagi antennas were first widely used during [[World War II]] in [[radar]] systems by the British, US, Germans and Japanese.&lt;ref name="Sarkar" /&gt;  After the war they saw extensive development as home [[television antenna]]s.

==Description==
[[File:A8-8.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antenna with a [[passive radiator|reflector]] (''left''), half-wave driven element (''centre''), and [[passive radiator|director]] (''right''). Exact spacings and element lengths vary somewhat according to specific designs.]]

The Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antenna consists of a number of parallel thin rod elements in a line, usually half-wave long, typically supported on a perpendicular crossbar or "boom" along their centers.&lt;ref name="wiseGEEK" /&gt;  There is a single [[driven element]] driven in the center (consisting of two rods each connected to one side of the transmission line), and a variable number of [[parasitic element]]s, a single ''reflector'' on one side and optionally one or more ''directors'' on the other side.&lt;ref name="wiseGEEK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Balanis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt;  The parasitic elements are not electrically connected to the transmitter or receiver, and serve as [[passive radiator]]s, reradiating the radio waves to modify the [[radiation pattern]].&lt;ref name="wiseGEEK" /&gt;    Typical spacings between elements vary from about {{frac|1|10}} to ¼ of a wavelength, depending on the specific design. The directors are slightly shorter than the driven element, while the reflector(s) are slightly longer.&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt;  The [[radiation pattern]] is unidirectional, with the [[main lobe]] along the axis perpendicular to the elements in the plane of the elements, off the end with the directors.&lt;ref name="Balanis" /&gt;

Conveniently, the dipole parasitic elements have a [[node (physics)|node]] (point of zero [[radio frequency|RF]] [[voltage]]) at their centre, so they can be attached to a conductive metal support at that point without need of insulation, without disturbing their electrical operation.&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt;  They are usually bolted or welded to the antenna's central support boom.&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt;  The driven element is fed at centre so its two halves must be insulated where the boom supports them.

The gain increases with the number of parasitic elements used.&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt;  Only one reflector is used since the improvement of gain with additional reflectors is negligible, but Yagis have been built with up to 30&amp;ndash;40 directors.&lt;ref name="Balanis" /&gt;

The [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the antenna is the frequency range between the frequencies at which the gain drops 3&amp;nbsp;dB (one-half the power) below its maximum. The Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda array in its basic form has very narrow bandwidth, 2&amp;ndash;3 percent of the centre frequency.&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt;  There is a tradeoff between gain and bandwidth, with the bandwidth narrowing as more elements are used.&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt;   For applications that require wider bandwidths, such as [[terrestrial television]], Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antennas commonly feature trigonal reflectors, and larger diameter conductors, in order to cover the relevant portions of the VHF and UHF bands.&lt;ref name=hdtvprimer&gt;[http://www.hdtvprimer.com/antennas/types.html Common TV Antenna Types]&lt;/ref&gt; Wider bandwidth can also be achieved by the use of "traps", as described below.

Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antennas used for [[amateur radio]] are sometimes designed to operate on multiple bands. These elaborate designs create electrical breaks along each element (both sides) at which point a parallel [[LC circuit|LC]] ([[inductor]] and [[capacitor]]) circuit is inserted. This so-called ''trap'' has the effect of truncating the element at the higher frequency band, making it approximately a half wavelength in length. At the lower frequency, the entire element (including the remaining inductance due to the trap) is close to half-wave resonance, implementing a ''different'' Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antenna. Using a second set of traps, a "triband" antenna can be resonant at three different bands. Given the associated costs of erecting an antenna and rotor system above a tower, the combination of antennas for three amateur bands in one unit is a very practical solution. The use of traps is not without disadvantages, however, as they reduce the bandwidth of the antenna on the individual bands and reduce the antenna's electrical efficiency and subject the antenna to additional mechanical considerations (wind loading, water and insect ingress).

==Theory of operation==
[[File:Two meter yagi.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|A portable Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antenna for use at 144&amp;nbsp;MHz (2&amp;nbsp;m), with segments of yellow tape-measure ribbon for the arms of the driven and parasitic elements.]]

Consider a Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda consisting of a reflector, driven element and a single director as shown here. The driven element is typically a [[Dipole antenna#Half-wave antenna|½&amp;#x202f;''λ'' dipole]] or [[folded dipole]] and is the only member of the structure that is directly excited (electrically connected to the [[feedline]]). All the other elements are considered ''parasitic''. That is, they reradiate power which they receive from the driven element (they also interact with each other).

One way of thinking about the operation of such an antenna is to consider a parasitic element to be a normal dipole element of finite diameter fed at its centre, with a short circuit across its feed point. As is well known in [[transmission line]] theory, a short circuit reflects all of the incident power 180 degrees out of phase. So one could as well model the operation of the parasitic element as the superposition of a dipole element receiving power and sending it down a transmission line to a matched load, and a transmitter sending the same amount of power up the transmission line back toward the antenna element. If the transmitted voltage wave were 180&amp;nbsp;degrees out of phase with the received wave at that point, the superposition of the two voltage waves would give zero voltage, equivalent to shorting out the dipole at the feedpoint (making it a solid element, as it is). Thus a half-wave parasitic element radiates a wave 180° out of phase with the incident wave.

The fact that the parasitic element involved is not exactly resonant but is somewhat shorter (or longer) than ½&amp;#x202f;''λ'' modifies the phase of the element's current with respect to its excitation from the driven element. The so-called ''reflector'' element, being longer than ½&amp;#x202f;''λ''&amp;#x202f;, has an inductive [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] which means the phase of its current lags the phase of the open-circuit voltage that would be induced by the received field. The ''director'' element, on the other hand, being shorter than ½&amp;#x202f;''λ''&amp;#x202f;, has a capacitive reactance with the voltage phase lagging that of the current.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Poz01|Pozar (2001)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The elements are given the correct lengths and spacings so that the radio waves radiated by the driven element and those re-radiated by the parasitic elements all arrive at the front of the antenna in-phase, so they superpose and add, increasing signal strength in the forward direction. In other words, the crest of the forward wave from the reflector element reaches the driven element just as the crest of the wave is emitted from that element. These waves reach the first director element just as the crest of the wave is emitted from that element, and so on. The waves in the reverse direction [[destructive interference|interfere destructively]], cancelling out, so the signal strength radiated in the reverse direction is small. Thus the antenna radiates a unidirectional beam of radio waves from the front (director end) of the antenna.

==Analysis==
While the above qualitative explanation is useful for understanding how parasitic elements can enhance the driven elements' radiation in one direction at the expense of the other, the assumptions used are quite inaccurate. Since the so-called reflector, the longer parasitic element, has a current whose phase lags that of the driven element, one would expect the directivity to be in the direction of the reflector, opposite of the actual directional pattern of the Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antenna. In fact, that would be the case were we to construct a phased array with rather closely spaced elements all driven by voltages in phase, as we posited.

However these elements are not driven as such but receive their energy from the field created by the driven element, so we will find almost the opposite to be true. For now, consider that the parasitic element is also of length λ/2. Again looking at the parasitic element as a dipole which has been shorted at the feedpoint, we can see that if the parasitic element were to respond to the driven element with an open-circuit feedpoint voltage in phase with that applied to the driven element (which we'll assume for now) then the ''reflected'' wave from the short circuit would induce a current 180° out of phase with the current in the driven element. This would tend to cancel the radiation of the driven element. However, due to the reactance caused by the length difference, the phase lag of the current in the reflector, added to this 180° lag, results in a phase ''advance'', and vice versa for the director. Thus the directivity of the array indeed is in the direction towards the director.

&lt;gallery widths="330px" heights="300px"&gt;
Yagi antenna animation 16 frame 1.6s.gif|How the antenna works. The radio waves from each element are emitted with a phase delay, so that the individual waves emitted in the forward direction ''(up)'' are in phase, while the waves in the reverse direction are out of phase. Therefore, the forward waves add together, ([[constructive interference]]) enhancing the power in that direction, while the backward waves partially cancel each other ([[destructive interference]]), thereby reducing the power emitted in that direction.  At other angles, the power emitted is intermediate between the two extremes.

The wave (green) from the driven element excites a current in the passive director which reradiates a wave (blue) having a particular phase shift (see explanation in text). The addition of these waves (bottom) is increased in the forward direction, but leads to cancellation in the reverse direction.

Zij-en.png|Mutual impedance between parallel &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{{\lambda \over 2}}&lt;/math&gt; dipoles not staggered as a function of spacing. Curves '''Re''' and '''Im''' are the resistive and reactive parts of the mutual impedance. Note that at zero spacing we obtain the self-impedance of a half-wave dipole, 73&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;j43&amp;nbsp;Ω.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

One must take into account an additional phase delay due to the finite distance between the elements which further delays the phase of the currents in both the directors and reflector(s). The case of a Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda array using just a driven element and a director is illustrated in the accompanying diagram taking all of these effects into account. The wave generated by the driven element (green) propagates in both the forward and reverse directions (as well as other directions, not shown). The director receives that wave slightly delayed in time (amounting to a phase delay of about 35° which will be important for the reverse direction calculations later), and generating a current that would be out of phase with the driven element (thus an additional 180° phase shift), but which is further ''advanced'' in phase (by about 70°) due to the director's shorter length. In the forward direction the net effect is a wave emitted by the director (blue) which is about 110° (180°&amp;ndash;70°) retarded with respect to that from the driven element (green), in this particular design. These waves combine to produce the net forward wave (bottom, right) with an amplitude slightly larger than the individual waves.

In the reverse direction, on the other hand, the additional delay of the wave from the director (blue) due to the spacing between the two elements (about 35° of phase delay traversed twice) causes it to be about 180° (110°&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;35°) out of phase with the wave from the driven element (green). The net effect of these two waves, when added (bottom, left), is almost complete cancellation. The combination of the director's position and shorter length has thus obtained a unidirectional rather than the bidirectional response of the driven (half-wave dipole) element alone.

A full analysis of such a system requires computing the ''mutual impedances'' between the dipole elements&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Antenna Theory, Kai Fong Lee, 1984, John Wiley and Sons Ltd., {{ISBN|0-471-90167-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which implicitly takes into account the propagation delay due to the finite spacing between elements. We model element number ''j'' as having a feedpoint at the centre with a voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and a current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; flowing into it. Just considering two such elements we can write the voltage at each feedpoint in terms of the currents using the mutual impedances ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; V_1 = Z_{11} I_1 +  Z_{12} I_2 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; V_2 = Z_{21} I_1 +  Z_{22} I_2 &lt;/math&gt;

''Z''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; are simply the ordinary driving point impedances of a dipole, thus 73&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;j43&amp;nbsp;ohms for a half-wave element (or purely resistive for one slightly shorter, as is usually desired for the driven element). Due to the differences in the elements' lengths ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; have a substantially different reactive component. Due to reciprocity we know that ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; =  ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Now the difficult computation is in determining that mutual impedance  ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; which requires a numerical solution. This has been computed for two exact half-wave dipole elements at various spacings in the accompanying graph.

The solution of the system then is as follows. Let the driven element be designated 1 so that  ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  and  ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  are the voltage and current supplied by the transmitter. The parasitic element is designated 2, and since it is shorted at its "feedpoint" we can write that   ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Using the above relationships, then, we can solve for ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  in terms of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;0 = V_2 = Z_{21} I_1 +  Z_{22} I_2 &lt;/math&gt;
and so
: &lt;math&gt;I_2 = - {Z_{21}  \over Z_{22}}  \, I_1 &lt;/math&gt;.
This is the current induced in the parasitic element due to the current  ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in the driven element. We can also solve for the voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at the feedpoint of the driven element using the earlier equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_1 &amp;= Z_{11} I_1 + Z_{12} I_2 = Z_{11} I_1 - Z_{12}{Z_{21} \over Z_{22}} \, I_1 \\
&amp;= \left( Z_{11} - {Z_{21}^2 \over Z_{22}} \right) I_1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where we have substituted  ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; =  ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;. The ratio of voltage to current at this point is the ''driving point impedance'' ''Z&lt;sub&gt;dp&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the 2-element Yagi:

: &lt;math&gt; Z_{dp}= V_1 / I_1 = Z_{11}  -  {Z_{21}^2  \over Z_{22}}  &lt;/math&gt;
With only the driven element present the driving point impedance would have simply been ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, but has now been modified by the presence of the parasitic element. And now knowing the phase (and amplitude) of  ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in relation to ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as computed above allows us to determine the radiation pattern (gain as a function of direction) due to the currents flowing in these two elements. Solution of such an antenna with more than two elements proceeds along the same lines, setting each ''V''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all but the driven element, and solving for the currents in each element (and the voltage  ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at the feedpoint).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.sm.rim.or.jp/~ymushiak/sub.yubook.htm |title=Yagi-Uda Antenna |author1=S.

==Design==
There are no simple formulas for designing Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antennas due to the complex relationships between physical parameters such as

* element length and spacing
* element diameter
* performance characteristics: gain and input impedance

However using the above kinds of iterative analysis one can calculate the performance of a given a set of parameters and adjust them to optimize the gain (perhaps subject to some constraints). Since with an {{math|''n''}} element Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antenna, there are {{math|2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''1''}} parameters to adjust (the element lengths and relative spacings).
This iterative analysis method is not a straightforward. The mutual impedances plotted above only apply to {{math|''&amp;lambda;''/2}} length elements, so these might need to be recomputed to get good accuracy. 

The current distribution along a real antenna element is only approximately given by the usual assumption of a classical standing wave, requiring a solution of Hallen's integral equation taking into account the other conductors. Such a complete exact analysis considering all of the interactions mentioned is rather overwhelming, and approximations are inevitable on the path to finding a usable antenna.

Consequently, these antennas are often empirical designs using an element of [[trial and error]], often starting with an existing design modified according to one's hunch. The result might be checked by direct measurement or by computer simulation. 

A well-known reference employed in the latter approach is a report published by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) (now the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST)) that provides six basic designs derived from measurements conducted at 400&amp;nbsp;MHz and procedures for adapting these designs to other frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/451.pdf ''Yagi Antenna Design'', Peter P. Viezbicke, National Bureau of Standard Technical Note 688, December 1976]&lt;/ref&gt; These designs, and those derived from them, are sometimes referred to as "NBS yagis."

By adjusting the distance between the adjacent directors it is possible to reduce the back lobe of the radiation pattern.

==History==
[[File:NakajimaJ1N1-S.jpg|thumb|upright=2|A [[Nakajima J1N]]1-S night fighter with quadruple Yagi radar transceiver antennas]]
The Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antenna was invented in 1926 by [[Shintaro Uda]] of [[Tohoku University|Tohoku Imperial University]],&lt;ref name="Uda1925" /&gt; [[Sendai]], [[Japan]], with the collaboration of [[Hidetsugu Yagi]], also of Tohoku Imperial University.&lt;ref name="Yagi1926" /&gt;  Yagi and Uda published their first report on the wave projector directional antenna. Yagi demonstrated a [[proof of concept]], but the engineering problems proved to be more onerous than conventional systems.&lt;ref name=Brown138&gt;Brown, 1999, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Yagi published the first English-language reference on the antenna in a 1928 survey article on short wave research in Japan and it came to be associated with his name. However, Yagi always acknowledged Uda's principal contribution to the design, and the proper name for the antenna is, as above, the Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antenna (or array).

[[File:FuG 220 and FuG 202 radar of Me 110 1945.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Yagi arrays of the German FuG 220 radar on the nose of a late-World War II [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Messerschmitt 110]] fighter aircraft.]]

The Yagi was first widely used during [[World War II]] for airborne [[radar]] sets, because of its simplicity and directionality.&lt;ref name=Brown138/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graf, Rudolf F. (June 1959). [https://books.google.com.my/books?id=0dsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA214 "Make Your Own UHF Yagi Antenna".] ''Popular Mechanics'', pp. 144&amp;ndash;145, 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being invented in Japan, many Japanese radar engineers were unaware of the design until very late in the war, partly due to rivalry between the Army and Navy. The Japanese military authorities first became aware of this technology after the [[Battle of Singapore]] when they captured the notes of a British radar technician that mentioned "yagi antenna".  Japanese intelligence officers did not even recognise that Yagi was a Japanese name in this context.  When questioned, the technician said it was an antenna named after a Japanese professor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.my/books?id=MgpWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=yagi+singapore&amp;dq=yagi+singapore&amp;cd=8 2001 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium By IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society. International Symposium.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=N&gt;This story is analogous to the story of American intelligence officers interrogating German rocket scientists and finding out that [[Robert Goddard]] was the real pioneer of rocket technology even though he was not well known in the US at that time.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Horizontal polarization|horizontally polarized]] array can be seen under the leading edge of [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] carrier-based [[US Navy]] aircraft and the [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] long range patrol seaplane. Vertically polarized arrays can be seen on the cheeks of the [[P-61]] and on the [[nose cone]]s of many WWII aircraft, notably the [[Lichtenstein radar]]-equipped examples of the German [[Junkers Ju 88]]R-1 [[fighter-bomber]], and the British [[Bristol Beaufighter]] night-fighter and [[Short Sunderland]] flying-boat. Indeed, the latter had so many antenna elements arranged on its back &amp;ndash; in addition to its formidable turreted defensive armament in the nose and tail, and atop the hull &amp;ndash; it was nicknamed the ''fliegendes Stachelschwein'', or "Flying Porcupine" by German airmen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.my/books?id=9LVOSdGUGPkC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22Flying+Porcupine%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Dk0GTKy4B4i8rAeWvM3hDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Flying%20Porcupine%22&amp;f=false The Sunderland flying-boat queen, Volume 1 By John Evans, Page 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental ''Morgenstern'' German AI VHF-band radar antenna of 1943&amp;ndash;44 used a "double-Yagi" structure from its 90° angled pairs of Yagi antennas formed from six discrete dipole elements, making it possible to fair the array within a conical, rubber-covered plywood radome on an aircraft's nose, with the extreme tips of the ''Morgenstern's'' antenna elements protruding from the radome's surface, with an [[NJG 4]] [[Ju 88]]G-6 of the wing's staff flight using it late in the war for its Lichtenstein SN-2 AI radar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hyperscale.com/images/aims_48D001%201%20-%203.jpg |title=HyperScale 48D001 Ju 88 G-6 and Mistel S-3C Collection decals  |date= |work= |publisher=Hyperscale.com |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War 2, the advent of [[television broadcasting]] motivated extensive development of the Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antenna as a rooftop television reception antenna in the [[very high frequency|VHF]] and [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] bands, and to a lesser extent an [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] antenna. Until the development of the [[log-periodic antenna]] in the 1960s, it was the only type of  antenna that could give adequate [[fringe reception]] in areas far from the television transmitter. A major drawback was the Yagi's inherently narrow bandwidth. Very complicated Yagi designs were developed to give adequate gain over the broad television bands. TV antennas are still a major application of the Yagi antenna.

The Yagi&amp;ndash;Uda antenna was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Directive_Short_Wave_Antenna,_1924 |title=Milestones:Directive Short Wave Antenna, 1924 |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Raid on Abole oil exploration facility}}

The company was operating in 2007 in the volatile, predominantly Somali [[Ogaden]] region of [[Ethiopia]] in 2007. At the time the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]] waged an insurgency against the Ethiopian government. The company and its employees suffered grievously as collateral damage in the war at 4:30 AM on April 24, 2007 when 200 ONLF militants attacked the company's camp in Abole, [[Somali Region]]. A firefight raged for 50 minutes between the attackers and 100 Ethiopian troops guarding the camp. The attack left 9 Chinese and 65 Ethiopians dead and 9 Chinese were taken as hostage.&lt;ref name="bokong"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kong|first1=Bo|title=China's International Petroleum Policy|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zyvex Marine''' is a division of [[Zyvex Technologies]], a [[molecular engineering]] company. Zyvex Marine develops boats that use Zyvex Technologies' proprietary [[nanomaterials]].

==History==

Zyvex Marine was formally announced as a division of Zyvex Technologies on November 4, 2011. It is headquartered in Bothell, Washington. Zyvex Marine launched its first production boat on November 4, 2011.

In 2009, prior to becoming a formal division, Zyvex Marine created the world's first commercialized carbon nanotube enhanced (CNTe) carbon fiber prototype vessel called the 540SE. It was designed to offer a 75% reduction in fuel consumption costs based on lightweight nanomaterials used in its hull design.

In 2010, it created the first prototype vessel called the [[Piranha Unmanned Surface Vessel]], which is a 54-foot (16.4 meter) boat made out of the same lightweight nanomaterials as the 540SE.

In 2011, Zyvex shipped its first production craft, a 54-foot lightweight boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zyvex-technologies-launches-new-maritime-division-zyvex-marine-133236563.html |title=Zyvex Technologies Launches New Maritime Division: Zyvex Marine |date=4 November 2011 |work=PR Newswire |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
