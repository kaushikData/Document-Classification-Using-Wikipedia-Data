&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Krishna with a flute.jpg|right|thumb|Devotional image of Lord Krishna]] --&gt;
In [[Hinduism]], '''Achyuta''' ([[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Acyuta}}'') is another name of [[Vishnu]]&lt;ref&gt;"‘Achyuta’ means immovable. Arjuna calls Lord Krishna ‘Achyuta’. He wants the immovable to start moving for him! ‘Achyuta’ also means one who has never fallen. Thereby Arjuna wants to suggest to Lord Krishna that He will never fail him." — Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1–6. Penguin Books, 1969, p 42 (verse 1:21), p 47 (verse 1:25)&lt;/ref&gt; and appears as the 100th&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/vishnu/vishnu_2.html Vishnu Sahasranamam]&lt;/ref&gt; and 318th names in the [[Vishnu sahasranama]]. It is also often used in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] as a personal name of [[Krishna]]. According to [[Adi Shankara]]'s commentary on the 1000 Names of Vishnu, Achyuta means "one who will never lose his inherent nature and powers". The name also means "immovable", "unchangeable", and as such is used for "the One who is without the six transformations, beginning with birth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140909235755/http://srilaprabhupadasaid.net/the-six-transformations/4557251155 Birth, lifespan, growth, actions, illusions, decay, death (or: hunger, thirst, grief, illusion, old age, death) Srila Prabhupada]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptural Quotations==
*''"[[Arjuna]] said: O infallible one (Achyuta), please draw up my chariot between the two armies so that I may see those present here desiring to fight, and know with whom I must contend in this great trial of arms."'' ([[Bhagavad Gita]] Chapter 1, verses 21-22)
*Arjuna speaking: ''"Thinking of You as my friend, I have rashly addressed You "O [[Krishna]]", "O [[Yadava]]", "O my friend", not knowing Your glories. Please forgive whatever I may have done in [[Insanity|madness]] or in [[love]]. I have dishonoured You many times, jesting as we relaxed, lay on the same bed, or sat or ate together, sometimes alone and sometimes in front of many friends. O infallible one (Acyuta), please excuse me for all those offences."'' (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 11, verses 41-42)
*Arjuna speaking:'' "Destroyed is my delusion, as I have gained my memory (knowledge) through your grace, O Achyuta. I stand firm with my doubts dispelled. I shall act according to your word."'' (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 18, verse 73)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1703">'''Aichmomancy''' (from Greek aikhmē, spearhead and manteia, prophecy) is a form of [[divination]] somewhat similar to [[Acultomancy]] in that it uses sharp pointed objects to show patterns to read.

Aichmomancy readers use pins, knives, forks, nails, and handmade pieces of wood sharpened to a point.  Readers drop sharp pointed objects onto a flat surface, find patterns and interpret them.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:aichmomancy with pins.jpg|thumb|Basic patterns and their interpretation]] --&gt;
In the most ancient form of this divination a spearhead was spun in the sand.  Several centuries later, during the [[Early Middle Ages]], divinations with pins became popular in [[Europe]].  Readers used seven pins and a table covered with cloth.  Pins were thrown over the table, and the patterns were read and interpreted.

The basic patterns and their interpretations:

'''Al-Maktoum College Of Higher Education '''is a college located in [[Dundee]], sponsored by [[Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Hamdan Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum]], deputy ruler of [[Dubai]] and minister of finance of the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Formerly known as Al-Maktoum Institute for Arabic and Islamic Studies, the college was established in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almcollege.org.uk/|author=Al-Maktoum College of Higher Education|title=Al-Maktoum College of Higher Education|publisher=Al-Maktoum College 2015|accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has built a mosque at the cost of  £1.3 million on its campus for the local Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-23929216|title=New £1.3m mosque opens on Dundee city campus|last=|first=|date=2 September 2013|work=BBC|access-date=17 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute has its own publishing press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almipress.com/ Al-Maktoum Institute Academic Press] [Retrieved 2015-07-11]&lt;/ref&gt;

The&amp;nbsp;College's&amp;nbsp;partnership agreement with the University of&amp;nbsp;Aberdeen&amp;nbsp;was terminated in September 2012. All students previously enrolled on higher education programmes at the&amp;nbsp;College&amp;nbsp;were transferred to the University of&amp;nbsp;Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/15380/1/RG988Al-Maktoum.pdf|title=Al-Maktoum College of Higher Education Review for Educational Oversight|last=|first=|date=May 2012|website=dera.ioe.ac.uk|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malory Nye controversy ==
Malory Nye was [[Head teacher|principal]] of the college until June 2011 when he was dismissed from his post together with his wife, Isabel Campbell-Nye, who was head of the English language centre.

The couple alleged that the [[Chief operating officer|director of operations]], and [[chairman]] of the college's [[board of directors]] decided to force them out because they're white, British Christians, among other claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/education/i-was-fired-for-being-a-white-christian-claims-professor-1-2331635|title=I was fired for being a white Christian, claims professor|last=McKlevie|first=Geraldine|date=June 1, 2012|work=The Scotsman|access-date=2018-01-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mailonline&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2080195/Malory-Nye-claims-sacked-white-Christian.html#ixzz54BHOy8o3|title='We were sacked for being white and Christian', claim principal and his wife dismissed from Dubai-backed 'multicultural' college|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=heraldscot&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13079212.Academics_lose_dismissal_claims |title= Academics lose dismissal claims |website= HeraldScotland.com |language=en |access-date= 2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all claims were dismissed at an [[employment tribunal]] in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=heraldscot/&gt;

The couple also lodged grievances against the [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the college, the [[Lord]] [[Murray Elder, Baron Elder|Baron Elder]] for his handling of what they describe as a ‘sham’ disciplinary process.&lt;ref name=mailonline/&gt; Lord Elder was then investigated by the [[House of Lords]] Conduct Committee and was found to have broken the House of Lords' Code of Conduct for incorrect registering of lord interest and misuse of the House of Lords stationery for his private business at the College by using a  House of Lords envelope to send the former college principal his termination letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldselect/ldprivi/75/7505.htm|title=Annex 2: Report from the commissioner for standards|last=Kernaghan|first=Paul|date=|website=publications.parliament.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the investigation, he issued an apology for his minor breaches of the Code of Conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13082643.Lord_Elder_sorry_for_code_breach/|title=Lord Elder sorry for code breach|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tobia Aoun.jpg|thumb|[[Tobia Aoun]] named Assistant at the Pontifical Throne in 1862]]
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
The '''Bishops-Assistant at the Pontifical Throne''' were ecclesiastical titles in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It designated [[prelate]]s belonging to the [[Papal Chapel]], who stood near the throne of the [[Pope]] at solemn functions.
The title has not been in use since Pope Paul VI issued his "motu proprio" ({{lang-la|Pontificalis Domus}}) on 28 March 1968, which reformed the Papal Court, renaming it the Papal Household and eliminated all previous titles of nobility.  Unless specified otherwise, all Assistants at the Pontifical Throne immediately entered the Papal nobility as Counts of Rome.
Assistants at the Pontifical Throne ranked immediately below the [[College of Cardinals]] and were also [[Palatinus (Roman Catholic Church)|Counts of the Apostolic Palace]].

==History==
All [[patriarch]]s and some [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] selected by the Pope, were made Assistants at the Pontifical Throne.

On 22 May 1862, during the canonization ceremony of the [[Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan|twenty-six Catholic martyrs of Japan]], Pope [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX]] elevated all the bishops present to the rank of Assistant at the Pontifical Throne. 
On 8 January 1866, [[Ruggero Luigi Emidio Antici Mattei]] was named Dean of the Assistants at the Pontifical Throne after Pope [[Pope_Pius_IX|Pius IX]] named him [[Latin_Patriarchate_of_Constantinople|Latin Patriarch of Constantinople]].
On 17 June 1867, during the 1800th anniversary of the martyrdom of Saints Peter and Paul, Pope Pius IX elevated all the bishops present to the rank of Assistant at the Pontifical Throne.

The title has not been in use since Pope [[Paul VI]]'s reform of the Pontifical Household in 28 March 1968 which eliminated all previous titles of nobility.

{{Zoroastrianism}}

The '''Avesta''' {{IPAc-en|ə|'|v|ɛ|s|t|ə|}} is the primary collection of [[religious text]]s of [[Zoroastrianism]], composed in the otherwise unrecorded [[Avestan]] language.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=1}}

The Avesta texts fall into several different categories, arranged either by [[dialect]], or by usage. The principal text in the [[liturgical]] group is the ''[[Yasna]]'', which takes its name from the Yasna ceremony, Zoroastrianism's primary act of worship, and at which the ''Yasna'' text is recited. The most important portion of the ''Yasna'' texts are the five [[Gathas]], consisting of seventeen hymns attributed to [[Zoroaster]] himself. These hymns, together with five other short Old Avestan texts that are also part of the ''Yasna'', are in the Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan language. The remainder of the ''Yasna''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; texts are in Younger Avestan, which is not only from a later stage of the language, but also from a different geographic region.

Extensions to the Yasna ceremony include the texts of the ''[[Vendidad]]'' and the ''[[Visperad]]''.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=3}} The ''Visperad'' extensions consist mainly of additional invocations of the divinities (''[[yazata]]''s),{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=2}} while the ''Vendidad'' is a mixed collection of prose texts mostly dealing with purity laws.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=2}} Even today, the ''Vendidad'' is the only liturgical text that is not recited entirely from memory.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=2}} Some of the materials of the extended Yasna are from the ''[[Yasht]]''s,{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=2}} which are hymns to the individual ''yazata''s. Unlike the ''Yasna'', ''Visperad'' and ''Vendidad'', the ''Yasht''s and the other lesser texts of the Avesta are no longer used liturgically in high rituals. Aside from the ''Yasht''s, these other lesser texts include the ''Nyayesh'' texts, the ''Gah'' texts, the ''Siroza'', and various other fragments. Together, these lesser texts are conventionally called ''[[Khordeh Avesta]]'' or "Little Avesta" texts. When the first ''Khordeh Avesta'' editions were printed in the 19th century, these texts (together with some non-Avestan language prayers) became a book of common prayer for lay people.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=3}}

The term ''Avesta'' is from the 9th/10th-century works of Zoroastrian tradition in which the word appears as [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian]] ''abestāg'',{{sfn|Kellens|1987|p=239}}{{sfn|Cantera|2015}} [[Book Pahlavi]] ''ʾp(y)stʾkʼ''.&lt;!-- Mackenzie, p. 3--&gt; &lt;!-- also [[Pazand]] ''avastak'' --&gt; In that context, ''abestāg'' texts are portrayed as received knowledge,&lt;!-- in the sense of Greek ''[[:wikt:ἐπιστήμη|epistéme]]''--&gt; and are distinguished from the exegetical commentaries (the ''[[Zend|zand]]'') thereof. The literal meaning of the word ''abestāg'' is uncertain; it is generally acknowledged to be a learned borrowing from Avestan, but none of the suggested etymologies have been universally accepted. The widely repeated derivation from [[linguistic reconstruction|*]]''upa-stavaka'' is from Christian Bartholomae (''Altiranisches Wörterbuch'', 1904), who interpreted ''abestāg'' as a contraction of a hypothetical [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] Old Iranian word for "praise-song" (Bartholomae: ''[[wikt:Lob#Derived terms|Lobgesang]]''); that word is not actually attested in any text.&lt;!-- gloss "reconstruction" for readers that do not know what reconstruction entails --&gt;

==Historiography==
The surviving texts of the Avesta, as they exist today, derive from a single master copy produced by [[Sasanian Empire]]-era (224–651 CE) collation and recension. That master copy, now lost, is known as the 'Sassanian archetype'. The oldest surviving manuscript (''K1''){{refn|1=''K1'' represents 248 leaves of a 340-leaf ''Vendidad Sade'' manuscript, i.e. a variant of a ''[[#Yasna|Yasna]]'' text into which sections of the ''[[#Visperad|Visperad]]'' and ''[[#Vendidad|Vendidad]]'' are interleaved. The colophon of ''K1'' (K=Copenhagen) identifies its place and year of completion to Cambay, 692Y (= 1323–1324 CE). The date of ''K1'' is occasionally mistakenly given as 1184. This mistake is due to a 19th-century confusion of the date of ''K1'' with the date of ''K1''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; source: in the postscript to ''K1'', the copyist – a certain Mehrban Kai Khusrow of Navsari – gives the date of his ''source'' as 552Y (= 1184 CE). That text from 1184 has not survived.|name="K1"|group="n"}} of an Avestan language text is dated 1323 CE.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=1}} Summaries of the various Avesta texts found in the 9th/10th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition suggest that a significant portion of the literature in the Avestan language has been lost.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=3}} Only about one-quarter of the Avestan sentences or verses referred to by the 9th/10th century commentators can be found in the surviving texts. This suggests that three-quarters of Avestan material, including an indeterminable number of juridical, historical and legendary texts, have been lost since then. On the other hand, it appears that the most valuable portions of the canon, including all of the oldest texts, have survived. The likely reason for this is that the surviving materials represent those portions of the Avesta that were in regular liturgical use, and therefore known by heart by the priests and not dependent for their preservation on the survival of particular manuscripts.

A pre-Sasanian history of the Avesta, if it had one, is in the realm of legend and myth. The oldest surviving versions of these tales are found in the ninth to 11th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition (i.e. in the so-called "Pahlavi books"). The legends run as follows: The twenty-one ''nask''s ("books") of the Avesta were created by Ahura Mazda and brought by [[Zoroaster]] to his patron [[Vishtaspa]] (''[[Denkard]]'' 4A, 3A).{{sfn|Humbach|1991|pp=50–51}} Supposedly, Vishtaspa (''Dk'' 3A) or another [[Kayanian dynasty|Kayanian]], [[Kai Darab|Daray]] (''Dk'' 4B), then had two copies made, one of which was stored in the treasury, and the other in the royal archives (''Dk'' 4B, 5).{{sfn|Humbach|1991|pp=51–52}} Following Alexander's conquest, the Avesta was then supposedly destroyed or dispersed by the Greeks after they translated the scientific passages that they could make use of (''AVN'' 7–9, ''Dk'' 3B, 8).{{sfn|Humbach|1991|pp=52–53}} Several centuries later, one of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] emperors named Valaksh (one of the [[Vologases (disambiguation)|Vologases]]) supposedly then had the fragments collected, not only of those that had previously been written down, but also of those that had only been orally transmitted (''Dk'' 4C).{{sfn|Humbach|1991|pp=52–53}}

The ''Denkard'' also transmits another legend related to the transmission of the Avesta. In that story, credit for collation and recension is given to the early Sasanian-era priest Tansar ([[mobad|high priest]] under [[Ardashir I]], ''r.'' 224–242, and [[Shapur I]], ''r'' 240/242–272), who had the scattered works collected, and of which he approved only a part as authoritative (''Dk'' 3C, 4D, 4E).{{sfn|Humbach|1991|pp=53–54}} Tansar's work was then supposedly completed by Adurbad Mahraspandan (high priest of [[Shapur II]], ''r.'' 309–379) who made a general revision of the canon and continued to ensure its orthodoxy (''Dk'' 4F, ''AVN'' 1.12–1.16).{{sfn|Humbach|1991|p=54}} A final revision was supposedly undertaken in the 6th century under [[Khosrow I]] (''Dk'' 4G).{{sfn|Humbach|1991|p=55}}

In the early 20th century, the legend of the Parthian-era collation engendered a search for a 'Parthian archetype' of the Avesta. In the theory of Friedrich Carl Andreas (1902), the archaic nature of the Avestan texts was assumed to be due to preservation via written transmission, and unusual or unexpected spellings in the surviving texts were assumed to be reflections of errors introduced by Sasanian-era transcription from the [[Aramaic alphabet]]-derived [[Pahlavi scripts]].{{refn|For a summary of Andreas' theory, see {{harvp|Schlerath|1987|pp=29–30}}.|group="n"}} The search for the 'Arsacid archetype' was increasingly criticized in the 1940s and was eventually abandoned in the 1950s after [[Karl Hoffmann (linguist)|Karl Hoffmann]] demonstrated that the inconsistencies noted by Andreas were actually due to unconscious alterations introduced by oral transmission.{{sfn|Humbach|1991|p=57}} Hoffmann identifies{{sfn|Hoffmann|1958|pp=7ff}} these changes to be due{{sfn|Humbach|1991|pp=56–63}} in part to modifications introduced through recitation;{{refn|For example, prefix repetition as in e.g. ''paitī ... paitiientī'' vs. ''paiti ... aiienī'' (''[[Yasna|Y.]]'' 49.11 vs. 50.9), or [[sandhi]] processes on word and syllable boundaries, e.g. ''adāiš'' for ''*at̰.āiš'' (48.1), ''ahiiāsā'' for ''ahiiā yāsā'', ''gat̰.tōi'' for ''*gatōi'' (43.1), ''ratūš š́iiaoϑanā'' for ''*ratū š́iiaoϑanā'' (33.1).{{sfn|Humbach|1991|pp=59–61}}|group="n"}} in part to influences from other Iranian languages picked up on the route of transmission from somewhere in eastern Iran (i.e. Central Asia) via Arachosia and Sistan through to Persia;{{refn|e.g. irregular internal ''hw'' &gt; ''x&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;'' as found in e.g. ''harax&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;ati''- 'Arachosia' and ''sāx&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;an-'' 'instruction', rather than regular internal ''hw'' &gt; ''ŋ&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;h'' as found in e.g. ''aojōŋ&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;hant''- 'strong'.{{sfn|Humbach|1991|p=58}}|group="n"}} and in part due to the influence of phonetic developments in the Avestan language itself.{{refn|e.g. YAv. ''-ō'' instead of expected OAv. ''-ə̄'' for Ir. ''-ah'' in almost all polysyllables.{{sfn|Humbach|1991|p=61}}|group="n"}}

The legends of an Arsacid-era collation and recension are no longer taken seriously.{{sfn|Humbach|1991|p=56}} It is now certain that for most of their long history the Avesta's various texts were handed down orally,{{sfn|Humbach|1991|p=56}} and independently of one another, and that it was not until around the 5th or 6th century that they were committed to written form.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=1}} However, during their long history, only the Gathic texts seem to have been memorized (more or less) exactly.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=2}} The other less sacred works appear to have been handed down in a more fluid oral tradition, and were partly composed afresh with each generation of poet-priests, sometimes with the addition of new material.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=2}} The Younger Avestan texts are therefore composite works, with contributions from several different authors over the course of several hundred years.

The texts became available to European scholarship comparatively late. [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]] travelled to [[India]] in 1755, and discovered the texts among Indian Zoroastrian ([[Parsi]]) communities. He published a set of French translations in 1771, based on translations provided by a Parsi priest. Anquetil-Duperron's translations were at first dismissed as a forgery in poor [[Sanskrit]], but he was vindicated in the 1820s following [[Rasmus Rask]]'s examination of the Avestan language (''A Dissertation on the Authenticity of the [[Zend#misnomer|Zend]] Language'', Bombay, 1821). Rask also established that Anquetil-Duperron's manuscripts were a fragment of a much larger literature of sacred texts. Anquetil-Duperron's manuscripts are at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] ('P'-series manuscripts), while Rask's collection now lies in the [[Royal Library, Denmark]] ('K'-series). Other large Avestan language manuscript collections are those of the [[British Museum]] ('L'-series)&lt;!-- the [[East India House]] collection is now also there--&gt;, the K. R. Cama Oriental Library in [[Mumbai]], the Meherji Rana library in [[Navsari]], and at various university and national libraries in Europe.

==Structure and content==
In its present form, the Avesta is a compilation from various sources, and its different parts date from different periods and vary widely in character. Only texts in the Avestan language are considered part of the Avesta.

According to the ''[[Denkard]]'', the 21 ''nask''s (books) mirror the structure of the 21-word-long ''[[Ahuna Vairya]]'' prayer: each of the three lines of the prayer consists of seven words. Correspondingly, the ''nask''s are divided into three groups, of seven volumes per group. Originally, each volume had a word of the prayer as its name, which so marked a volume's position relative to the other volumes. Only about a quarter of the text from the ''nask''s has survived until today.

The contents of the Avesta are divided topically (even though the organization of the ''nask''s is not), but these are not fixed or canonical. Some scholars prefer to place the categories in two groups, the one liturgical, and the other general. The following categorization is as described by Jean Kellens (see [[#Bibliography|bibliography]], below).

===The ''Yasna''===
{{Main|Yasna}}
[[Image:Bodleian J2 fol 175 Y 28 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Yasna 28.1 (Bodleian MS J2)]]
The ''Yasna'' (from ''yazišn'' "worship, oblations", cognate with Sanskrit ''[[yajna|yajña]]''), is the primary liturgical collection, named after the ceremony at which it is recited. It consists of 72 sections called the ''Ha-iti'' or ''Ha''. The 72 threads of lamb's wool in the ''[[Kushti]]'', the sacred thread worn by Zoroastrians, represent these sections. The central portion of the Yasna is the ''[[Gathas]]'', the oldest and most sacred portion of the Avesta, believed to have been composed by [[Zoroaster|Zarathushtra (Zoroaster)]] himself. The ''Gathas'' are structurally interrupted by the ''[[Yasna Haptanghaiti]]'' ("seven-chapter ''Yasna''"), which makes up chapters 35–42 of the ''Yasna'' and is almost as old as the ''Gathas'', consists of prayers and hymns in honour of the Supreme Deity, Ahura Mazda, the Angels, Fire, Water, and Earth. The younger ''Yasna'', though handed down in prose, may once have been metrical, as the ''Gathas'' still are.

===The ''Visperad''===
{{Main|Visperad}}
The ''Visperad'' (from ''vîspe ratavo'', "(prayer to) all patrons") is a collection of supplements to the ''Yasna''. The ''Visparad'' is subdivided into 23 or 24 ''kardo'' (sections) that are interleaved into the Yasna during a Visperad service (which is an extended Yasna service).

The ''Visperad'' collection has no unity of its own, and is never recited separately from the Yasna.

===The ''Vendidad''===
{{Main|Vendidad}}
The ''Vendidad'' (or ''Vidēvdāt'', a corruption of Avestan ''Vī-Daēvō-Dāta'', "Given Against the Demons") is an enumeration of various manifestations of evil spirits, and ways to confound them. The ''Vendidad'' includes all of the 19th ''nask'', which is the only ''nask'' that has survived in its entirety. The text consists of 22 ''Fargard''s, fragments arranged as discussions between [[Ahura Mazda]] and Zoroaster. The first ''fargard'' is a dualistic [[creation myth]], followed by the description of a destructive winter on the lines of the [[Flood myth]]. The second ''fargard'' recounts the legend of ''[[Jamshid|Yima]]''. The remaining ''fargard''s deal primarily with hygiene (care of the dead in particular) [''fargard'' 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 19] as well as disease and spells to fight it [7, 10, 11, 13, 20, 21, 22]. ''Fargard''s 4 and 15 discuss the dignity of wealth and charity, of marriage and of physical effort, and the indignity of unacceptable social behaviour such as assault and [[breach of contract]], and specify the penances required to atone for violations thereof. The ''Vendidad'' is an ecclesiastical code, not a liturgical manual, and there is a degree of [[moral relativism]] apparent in the codes of conduct. The ''Vendidad''{{'}}s different parts vary widely in character and in age. Some parts may be comparatively recent in origin although the greater part is very old.

The Vendidad, unlike the Yasna and the Visparad, is a book of moral laws rather than the record of a liturgical ceremony. However, there is a ceremony called the ''Vendidad'', in which the Yasna is recited with all the chapters of both the Visparad and the Vendidad inserted at appropriate points. This ceremony is only performed at night.

===The ''Yasht''s===
{{Main|Yasht}}
[[Image:Faravahar.svg|thumb|250px|right|[[Faravahar]], believed to be a depiction of a ''[[Fravashi]]'', as mentioned in the ''Yasna'', ''Yasht''s and ''Vendidad'']]
The ''[[Yasht]]''s (from ''yešti'', "worship by praise") are a collection of 21 hymns, each dedicated to a particular divinity or divine concept. Three hymns of the Yasna liturgy that "worship by praise" are—in tradition—also nominally called ''yasht''s, but are not counted among the ''Yasht'' collection since the three are a part of the primary liturgy. The ''Yasht''s vary greatly in style, quality and extent. In their present form, they are all in prose but analysis suggests that they may at one time have been in verse.

===The ''Siroza''===
The ''Siroza'' ("thirty days") is an enumeration and invocation of the 30 divinities presiding over the days of the month. (cf. [[Zoroastrian calendar]]). The ''Siroza'' exists in two forms, the shorter ("little ''Siroza''") is a brief enumeration of the divinities with their epithets in the genitive. The longer ("great ''Siroza''") has complete sentences and sections, with the ''yazata''s being addressed in the accusative.

The Siroza is never recited as a whole, but is a source for individual sentences devoted to particular divinities, to be inserted at appropriate points in the liturgy depending on the day and the month.

===The ''Nyayesh''es{{anchor|Niyayishn|Niyayish}}===
The five ''Nyayesh''es, abbreviated ''Ny.'', are prayers for regular recitation by both priests and laity.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=3}} They are addressed to the [[Hvare-khshaeta|Sun]] and [[Mithra]] (recited together thrice a day), to the [[Mah|Moon]] (recited thrice a month), and to [[Aban|the Waters]] and to [[Atar|Fire]].{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=3}} The ''Nyayesh''es are composite texts containing selections from the Gathas and the Yashts, as well as later material.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=3}}

===The ''Gah''s{{anchor|Gah|Gāh}}===
The five ''gāh''s are invocations to the five divinities that watch over the five divisions (''[[gāh]]''s) of the [[day]].{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=3}} ''Gāh''s are similar in structure and content to the five ''Nyayesh''es.

===The ''Afrinagan''s{{anchor|Afrinagan}}===
The ''Afrinagan''s are four "blessing" texts recited on a particular occasion: the first in honor of the dead, the second on the five epagomenal days that end the year, the third is recited at the six seasonal feasts, and the fourth at the beginning and end of summer.

===Fragments===
All material in the ''Avesta'' that is not already present in one of the other categories falls into a "fragments" category, which – as the name suggests – includes incomplete texts. There are altogether more than 20 fragment collections, many of which have no name (and are then named after their owner/collator) or only a Middle Persian name. The more important of the fragment collections are the ''Nirangistan'' fragments (18 of which constitute the ''Ehrbadistan''); the ''Pursishniha'' "questions," also known as "Fragments [[Tahmuras]]"; and the ''Hadokht Nask'' "volume of the scriptures" with two fragments of eschatological significance.

==Other Zoroastrian religious texts==
Only texts preserved in the Avestan language count as scripture and are part of the Avesta. Several other secondary works are nonetheless crucial to Zoroastrian theology and scholarship.

The most notable among the Middle Persian texts are the ''Dēnkard'' ("Acts of Religion"), dating from the ninth century; the ''[[Bundahishn]]'' ("Primordial Creation"), finished in the eleventh or twelfth century, but containing older material; the ''Mainog-i-Khirad'' ("Spirit of Wisdom"), a religious conference on questions of faith; and the ''[[Book of Arda Viraf]]'', which is especially important for its views on death, salvation and life in the hereafter. Of the post-14th century works (all in New Persian), only the ''[[Sad-dar]]'' ("Hundred Doors, or Chapters"), and ''[[rivayat]]''s (traditional treatises) are of doctrinal importance. Other texts such as ''Zartushtnamah'' ("Book of Zoroaster") are only notable for their preservation of legend and folklore. The ''Aogemadaeca'' "we accept," a treatise on death is based on quotations from the Avesta.

'''Basava Jayanthi''' is traditionally observed by the [[Lingayatism|Lingayats]] and is observed as a holiday in the [[India|Indian]] state of [[Karnataka]].  It marks the birthday of [[Basavanna]], 12th-century poet-philosopher, and the founding saint of the [[Lingayat]] sect.  It is celebrated with much pomp and gaiety all over south India, majorly in [[Karnataka]], Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Basava Jayanti celebrated |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/basava-jayanti-celebrated/article4712361.ece |publisher=The Hindu, Bangalore |date= May 14, 2013|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beit She'arim''' ({{lang-he-n|בֵּית שְׁעָרִים}}, "House of the Gates") is  the currently used name for the ancient Jewish town of '''Bet She'arāyim''' ({{Hebrew|בּית שערַיִם}}, "House of Two Gates") or '''Kfar She'arāyim''' ({{Hebrew|כְּפר שערַיִם}}, "Village of Two Gates").&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt; The site, located on a hill, was known initially by its [[Arabic]] name '''Sheikh Ibreik''' or '''Sheikh Abreik''',&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt; and which historical geographer [[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Samuel Klein]] in 1936 identified as Talmudic Beit She'arim.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 137 in: {{cite journal |last=Vitto|first=Fanny |title=Byzantine Mosaics at Bet She'arim: New Evidence for the History of the Site |journal='Atiqot |accessdate=31 August 2018 |volume=28|issue= |pages=115-146 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23458348 |date=1996|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}. In the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Kila'im'' 9:3), the town's name is written in an elided-consonant form, ({{Lang-he-n|בית שריי}}), which follows more closely the Greek transliteration in Josephus' ''[[Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' § 24, ({{lang-gr|Βησάραν}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another Arabic name is ''bayt al-ġurabāʾ'' ({{lang|ar|بيت الغرباء}}).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The partially excavated archaeological site consists mainly of an extensive [[necropolis]] of [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut tombs]] and some remains of the town itself. The site is managed by the [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority|National Parks Authority]] as the '''Beit She'arim National Park'''. It borders the town of [[Kiryat Tiv'on]] on the northeast and is located five kilometres west of [[Moshav]] [[Beit She'arim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02881.html Modern Bet She'arim] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated 20&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Haifa]] in the southern foothills of the [[Lower Galilee]].

In 2015 it was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The rationale of the committee was as follows: The town's vast necropolis, carved out of soft limestone, contains more than 30 burial cave systems. Although only a portion of the necropolis has been excavated, it has been likened to a book inscribed in stone. Its catacombs, mausoleums, and sarcophagi are adorned with elaborate symbols and figures as well as an impressive quantity of incised and painted inscriptions in Hebrew, Aramaic, Palmyrene, and Greek, documenting two centuries of historical and cultural achievement. The wealth of artistic adornments contained in this, the most ancient extensive Jewish cemetery in the world, is unparalleled anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4676480,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1471], [[UNESCO world heritage site]],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
According to [[Moshe Sharon]], following [[Yechezkel Kutscher]], the name of the city was Beit She'arayim or Kfar She'arayim (the House/Village of Two Gates).&lt;ref name="Sharon"&gt;Sharon, Moshe (2004), Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae, Vol. III, D-F; page XXXVII [https://books.google.com/books?id=01ogNhTNz54C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR37#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Yemenite Jewish pronunciation of the name is also "Bet She'arayim", which is more closely related to the [[Ancient Greek]] rendition of the name, i.e. Βησάρα, "Besara".&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Talmud, Punctuated'' ({{Hebrew|תלמוד בבלי מנוקד}}), ed. Yosef Amar, Jerusalem 1980, s.v. ''Sanhedrin'' 32b (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular orthography for the Hebrew word for house, {{Hebrew|בֵּית}}, is "beit", while the traditional King James one is "beth", the effort being now to replace both with the etymologically better suited "bet".

==History==

===Iron Age===
Pottery shards discovered at the site indicate that a first settlement there dates back to the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Second Temple period===
[[File:BeitShearimSarcophagus1-v.jpg|thumb|200px|Two lions facing each other, a Greek mythological scene decorating a sarcophagus in the Cave of the Coffins]]
Beit She'arayim was founded at the end of the 1st century BCE, during the reign of King [[Herod the Great|Herod]].&lt;ref name=Mazar19&gt;Benjamin Mazar, ''Beth She'arim : Report on the Excavations during 1936-1940'', Vol. I, p19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus Flavius]], in his [[The Life of Flavius Josephus|''Vita'']], referred to the city in Greek as Besara, the administrative center of the estates of [[Berenice II of Egypt|Queen Berenice]] in the [[Jezreel Valley]].&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt;

===Roman and Byzantine periods===
[[Benjamin Mazar]] described it as a prosperous [[Jew]]ish town eventually destroyed by fire in 352, at the end of the [[Jewish revolt against Gallus]] and that after some time it was renewed as a [[Byzantine]] city,&lt;ref name=Mazar19/&gt; but more recent research shows that the Gallus revolt had a much lesser impact on the town.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; The [[Galilee earthquake of 363]] did damage Bet She'arayim, but without long-lasting effects.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

After the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, the  [[Sanhedrin]] (Jewish legislature and supreme council) moved to Beit She'arayim.&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt; The town is mentioned rabbinical literature as an important center of Jewish learning during the 2nd century.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; Rabbi [[Judah the Prince]] (Yehudah HaNasi), head of the Sanhedrin and compiler of the [[Mishna]], lived there. In the last seventeen years of his life, he moved to [[Sepphoris]] for health reasons, but planned his burial in Beit She'arim. According to tradition, he owned there land he received as a gift from his friend, the Roman emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] Antoninus.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The most desired burial place for Jews was the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]], but in 135 CE, when Jews were barred from the area, Beit She'arim became an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhPlUt1kz-wC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=land+beit+she%27arim&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IHnzWvgzpQ&amp;sig=8ycK-VQl1S8C-BScn4fxQfR8iqI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=czzcSp_6NqSwnQPvpKzaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Holy Land: An Oxford archaeological guide, From earliest times to 1700, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried there led many other Jews from all over the country and from the [[Jewish Diaspora]], from nearby [[Phoenicia]]&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; to far-away [[Himyar]] in [[Yemen]],&lt;ref name="Hymiar"&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946, pp. 53–57, 148, 283–284 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; to be buried next to his grave.

While it was originally thought that Bet She'arayim was destroyed during the [[Jewish revolt against Gallus]] in the mid-4th century, recent research has revealed the destruction to be far less extensive.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; An earthquake in 386 caused some damage, but the town recovered and enjoyed prosperity during the era of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]].&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; Almost 300 inscriptions primarily in [[Greek language|Greek]], but also in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]] were found on the walls of the catacombs containing numerous sarcophagi.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Early Islamic period===
From the beginning of the Early Islamic period (7th century), settlement was sparse.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar, p20.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations uncovered 75 lamps dating to the period of [[Umayyad]] (7th-8th centuries) and [[Abassid]] (8th-13th centuries) rule over Palestine.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; A large Abbasid-period [[glassmaking]] facility from the 9th century was also found at the site (see [[Beit She'arim National Park#Glassmaking industry (Abbasid period)|below]]).

===Crusader period===
There is some evidence of activity in the former city area and necropolis dating to the [[Crusades|Crusader period]] (12th century), probably connected to travellers and temporary settlement.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Ottoman period===
A small Arab village called [[Sheikh Bureik, Lajjun|Sheikh Bureik]] was located here in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hütteroth, Wolf-Dieter; Abdulfattah, Kamal (1977), Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century. Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband, Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fränkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A map by [[Pierre Jacotin]]  from [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Napoleon's invasion of 1799]] showed the place, named as ''Cheik Abrit.''&lt;ref&gt;Karmon, 1960, p. [http://www.jchp.ucla.edu/Bibliography/Karmon,_Y_1960_Jacotin_Map_(IEJ_10).pdf 163]&lt;/ref&gt;

The village is mentioned again in [[Palestine Exploration Fund|The Survey of Western Palestine]] (SWP) citing data from 1859,&lt;ref name=SWP.273&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/273/mode/1up 273]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1875 by [[Victor Guérin]].&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1880, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr01unkngoog#page/n408/mode/1up  395]-397&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the Ottoman authorities sold Shayk Abreik (together with a total of 23 villages and some seventy square miles of land) for £20,000 to the  [[Sursuk family]] of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.  [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/356/mode/1up  356]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Survey of Western Palestine", published in 1881, describes Sheikh Abreik as a small village situated on a hill with a conspicuous [[Maqam (shrine)|''maqam'']] (sanctuary, holy tomb) located to the south. The village houses were made mostly of [[adobe|mud]], and it belonged to the Sursuk family. The population at this time was estimated to be around 150.&lt;ref name=SWP.273/&gt; During [[World War I]], the "finest oaks" of Sheikh Bureik were "ruthlessly destroyed" by the Turkish Army for use as rail fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, report of 1923, quoted by R. El-Eini, British forestry policy in Mandate Palestine 1929-48: Aims and realities, ''Middle Eastern Studies'', Vol. 35, 1999, pp 72–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Mandate===
The October [[1922 census of Palestine]] recorded Sheikh Abreik with a population of 111 Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Haifa, p. [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/PalestineCensus1922/p33.pdf  33]&lt;/ref&gt; At some time during the early 1920s, the Sursuk family sold the lands of the village to the [[Jewish National Fund]], via [[Yehoshua Hankin]], a [[Zionist]] activist who was responsible for most of the major land purchases of the [[World Zionist Organization]] in Ottoman Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Avneri, 1984, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Teb4dKHQcoC&amp;pg=PA122 122]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1925, according to [[Media:ShawSursockTable.png|List of villages sold by Sursocks and their partners to the Zionists since British occupation of Palestine]], evidence to the [[Shaw Commission]], 1930&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, which included lands from the Arab villages of Harithiya, Sheikh Abreik and [[Harbaj]], a total of 59 Arab tenants were evicted from the three villages, with 3,314 pounds compensation paid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth W. Stein]], ''The Land Question in Palestine, 1917-1939'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 an agricultural settlement also named Sheikh Abreik was established by the [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]], a Zionist political party and settlement movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Universal Jewish Encyclopedia'', Vol 6, entry "Colonies, Agricultural", p287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[File:BeitShearimSarcophagus2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Visitors at the Cave of the Coffins]]
The archaeological importance of the site was recognized in the 1880s by the Survey of Western Palestine, which explored many tombs and catacombs but did no excavation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/343/mode/1up Survey of Western Palestine, Vol. I, pp. 325-328 and 343-351]&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] village of Sheikh Bureik was located on the hill until the 1920s, when the land was purchased by the [[Jewish National Fund]].  In 1936, [[Alexander Zaïd]], employed by the JNF as a watchman, reported that he had found a breach in the wall of one of the caves which led into another cave decorated with inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar, p27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s and 1950s, the site was excavated by Benjamin Mazar and [[Nahman Avigad]].

===Jewish necropolis===
Most of the remains date from the 2nd to 4th century CE. A large number of individuals were buried in the more than twenty catacombs of the necropolis. Geographical references in inscriptions on the walls of the catacombs reveal that the necropolis was used by people from the town of Beit She'arim, from elsewhere in Galilee, and even from cities as far away as [[Palmyra]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East'' considers Beth She'arim of international importance (Volume 1, p. 309-11); Tessa Rajak considers its importance regional ("The rabbinic dead and the Diaspora dead at Beth She’arim" in P. Schäfer (ed.), ''The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman culture'' 1 (Tübingen 1997), p. 349-66); S. Schwartz however, in ''Imperialism and Jewish society, 200 B.C.E. to 640 C.E.'' (Princeton 2001), p. 153-8, plays down the importance of Beth She'arim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from an extensive body of inscriptions in several languages, the walls and tombs have many images, engraved and carved in [[relief]], ranging from Jewish symbols and geometric decoration to animals and figures from Hellenistic myth and religion.&lt;ref name="Beth She'arim"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1643/ Beth She'arim], [[UNESCO world heritage site]] "tentative list", summary from 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, two new caves were opened to the public whose burial vaults date to the first two centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1124426.html Row erupts over discovery of Beit Shearim caves, [[Haaretz]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cave of Judah the Prince====
The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] cites Beit She'arim as the burial place of Rabbi [[Judah the Prince]], Yehuda HaNasi in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Kelaim 9, 32a-b&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral is described as follows: "Miracles were wrought on that day. It was evening and all the towns gathered to mourn him, and eighteen synagogues praised him and bore him to Bet Shearim, and the daylight remained until everyone reached his home (Ketubot 12, 35a)." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/97mag/betshearim/betshearim.htm Bet Shearim archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried here is believed to be a major reason for the popularity of the necropolis in Late Antiquity. The catacomb No. 14 is likely to have belonged to the family of Rabbi Judah the Prince.&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Beit She'arim - The Jewish necropolis of the Roman Period |author= |work=www.mfa.gov.il |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=2000 |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/israelexperience/history/pages/beit%20she-arim%20-%20the%20jewish%20necropolis%20of%20the%20roman.aspx |accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clear inscription stating the name and title of Rabbi Judah the Prince in that catacomb identifies it as his burial site.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East'', Volume 1, p. 309-11. For a more cautious view see M. Jacobs, ''Die Institution des jüdischen Patriarchen, eine quellen- und traditionskritische Studie zur Geschichte der Juden in der Spätantike'' (Tübingen 1995), p. 247, n. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; A Hebrew wall inscription from Catacomb 14 reads "Simon [Shimon] my son shall be [[hakham]] [president of the Sanhedrin], Gamaliel my son [[Nasi (Hebrew title)#Late Roman empire to medieval period|patriarch]], Hanania bar Hama shall preside over the great court", in reference to Rabbi Judah's sons Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Gamliel, and to his student, Rabbi [[Hanina bar Hama]].&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt;  Two tombs located next to each other within the same catacomb are identified by bilingual Hebrew and Greek inscriptions as those of "R. Gamliel" and "R. Shimon", believed to refer to Judah's sons, the ''nasi'' [[Gamaliel III]] and the ''hakham'' Rabbi Shimon.&lt;ref name="Zelcer"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to the Jerusalem Talmud |series= |author=Heshey Zelcer |year=2002 |location= |publisher=[[Universal Publishers (United States)|Universal Publishers]] |page=74 |isbn=9781581126303 |quote=In 1954 two adjoining sepulchres in cave 14 in Bet She'arim were discovered bearing the inscriptions in Hebrew and Greek "R.

====Himyarite tombs====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Yemenite Jews]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
[[File:Tomb Inscription of Himyarite buried in Beit She'arim National Park (Israel).jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Himyarite, in Greek uncials]]

In 1937, [[Benjamin Mazar]] revealed at Beit She'arim a system of tombs belonging to the Jews of [[Himyar]] (now [[Yemen]]) dating back to the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946,  pp. 53–57, 148, 283–284 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of ties between Yemenite Jewry and the Land of Israel can be learnt by the system of tombs at Beit She'arim dating back to the 3rd century. It is of great significance that Jews from Ḥimyar were being brought for interment in what was then considered a prestigious place, near the catacombs of the [[Sanhedrin]]. Those who had the financial means brought their dead to be buried in the Land of Israel, as it was considered an outstanding virtue for Jews not to be buried in foreign lands, but rather in the land of their forefathers. It is speculated that the Ḥimyarites, during their lifetime, were known and respected in the eyes of those who dwelt in the Land of Israel, seeing that one of them, whose name was Menaḥem, was coined the epithet ''qyl ḥmyr'' [prince of Ḥimyar], in the eight-character Ḥimyari ligature, while in the Greek inscription he was called ''Menae presbyteros'' (Menaḥem, the community's elder).&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies, 43 (2013): British Museum, London; Article by Yosef Tobi, ''The Jews of Yemen in light of the excavation of the Jewish synagogue in Qanī’'', p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of a woman written in Greek in its genitive form, Ενλογιαζ, is also engraved there, meaning either 'virtue', 'blessing', or 'gratis'; however, its precise transcription remains of scholarly dispute.&lt;ref&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946, pp. 56 – 57; p. 33 plate b. Christian Robin rejects the interpretation of the ligature ''qyl ḥmyr''. He notes that today the inscription ''Menae presbyteros'' can no longer be seen. The only secured inscription is ''Ômêritôn'' [the Ḥimyari].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abbasid period===

====Glassmaking industry====
In 1956, a bulldozer working at the site unearthed an enormous rectangular slab, 11×6.5×1.5 feet, weighing 9 tons. Initially, it was paved over, but it was eventually studied and found to be a gigantic piece of glass. A [[glassmaking]] furnace was located here in the 9th century during the [[History of Palestine#Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid periods|Abbasid period]], which produced great batches of molten glass that were cooled and later broken into small pieces for crafting glass vessels.&lt;ref name=Negev&gt;Negev and Gibson, 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=sheikh+ibreik&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=sheikh%20ibreik&amp;f=false  pp86-87].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/dynamic.aspx?id=9420 The Mystery Slab of Beit She'arim, Corning Glass Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poem inside catacomb====
An [[elegy]] written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] script typical of the 9-10th century and containing the date AH 287 or 289 (AD 900 or 902) was found in the ''Magharat al-Jahannam'' ("Cave of Hell") catacomb during excavations conducted there in 1956. The sophisticated and beautifully worded elegy was composed by the previously unknown poet Umm al-Qasim, whose name is given in [[acrostic]] in the poem, and it can be read in Moshe Sharon's book or [[Sheikh Bureik, Lajjun#Poem from Abbasid period|here]] on Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Sharon.xli&gt;Sharon, 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=01ogNhTNz54C&amp;pg=PR41 xli]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moshe Sharon speculates that this poem might be marking the beginning of the practice of treating this site as the sanctuary of Sheikh Ibreik and suggests the site was used for burial at this time and possibly later as well.&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharon.xlii&gt;Sharon, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=01ogNhTNz54C&amp;pg=PR42  p.xlii]&lt;/ref&gt; He further notes that the cave within which the inscription was found forms part of a vast area of ancient ruins which constituted a natural place for the emergence of a local shrine. Drawing on the work of Tawfiq Canaan, Sharon cites his observation that 32% of the sacred sites he visited in Palestine were located in the vicinity of ancient ruins.&lt;ref name=Sharon.xlii/&gt;

===Recent excavations===
[[File:The gate of Bet Shearim 01.jpg|250px|thumb|The gate of Bet Shearim  that eas published on January 2017]]
The excavations at the site were resumed by  Adi Erlich, on behalf of the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, The [[University of Haifa]]. Erlich is focusing her excavation on the hilltop above the necropolis, where the ancient town had existed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Beth-Shearim-Excavation/556477027790445 Official Facebook page of renewed expedition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bishop of Sodor and Man''' is the [[Ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]] of the [[Diocese of Sodor and Man]] (Manx Gaelic: ''Sodor as Mannin'') in the [[Province of York]] in the [[Church of England]]. The diocese only covers the [[Isle of Man]]. The [[Peel Cathedral|Cathedral Church of St German]] where the bishop's seat is located, is in the town of [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]]. St German's was elevated to cathedral status on 1 November 1980.

[[File:Cathedra Sodor and Man.jpg|thumb|Cathedra (throne) of the Bishop of Sodor and Man, in Peel Cathedral.]]The bishop is an ''ex officio'' member of the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man]] (the upper house of [[Tynwald]], the parliament of the [[Isle of Man]]) and of [[Tynwald Court]]. The bishop's residence is Thie yn Aspick (Bishop's House), [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Crockford| surname = Peter Andrew | forenames = Eagles | id = 24771 | accessed = 26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to appoint the Bishop of Sodor and Man is vested in the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British crown]]; the Monarch acts, perhaps somewhat anomalously (in view of Man's status as a [[Crown Dependency]]), on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. However, unlike diocesan bishops in England, who are formally elected by the canons of the cathedral church in accordance with the monarch's ''congé d'elire'',&lt;ref&gt;Hill M. (2007), ''Ecclesiastical Law'' (3rd ed, Oxford), paras.4.57-4.59&lt;/ref&gt; the Bishop of Sodor and Man is appointed directly by the monarch by letters patent.&lt;ref&gt;Gumbley, K F W (1994), ''Church Legislation in the Isle of Man'', 3 Eccles. L.J. at p.294 [http://www.gumbley.net/article.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Eagles]] was appointed Bishop of Sodor and Man, and was installed at the [[Peel Cathedral|Cathedral Church of St German]] at Peel on 30 September 2017.

== Diocese==
{{main|Diocese of Sodor and Man}}
The name "Sodor and Man" is from an earlier diocese which included not only the Isle of Man but also the [[Hebrides]]. The name for this whole area in the original [[North Germanic languages|Norse]] was ''Suðreyjar'' (''Sudreys'' or "southern isles"). In [[Latin language|Latin]], the corresponding adjective was ''Sodorensis'', later abbreviated in the English title as Sodor. 
In the [[Middle Ages]], the diocese was considered part of Scotland, and was under the control of neither the [[Archbishop of York]] nor the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. During the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]], the [[Pope]] created a different line of bishops in the southern part of the diocese which became part of the [[Church of England]]. An Act of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in 1542, during the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], included the diocese in the [[Province of York]].&lt;ref name=Powicke254&gt;Powicke ''Handbook of British Chronology'' 2nd ed. p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; The termination "and Man" appears to have been added in the 17th century, as later generations did not realise that "Sodor" originally included the Isle of Man. The designation "Sodor and Man" had become a fixture by 1684.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5513">'''The Chandabhoy Galla Case''' is a celebrated case in the history of religion where a human being is challenged for representing God on earth being infallible and immaculate. The case was filed during British rule in India  by Sir Thomas Strangman, the Advocate General of Mumbai at the behest of Adamjee Pirbhai family members against [[Dawoodi Bohra]] 51st Dai Syedna [[Taher Saifuddin]]. The case was filed in 1917AD and decided in 1921AD. The claim was based on the belief of  Imam as representative of the Prophet, and through him the representative of God, having withdrawn from the world, someone must represent him, and so ultimately the Deity on earth.  The Dai, according to community religious belief, is that representative. The ownership of the Chandabhoy ‘Galla’( box kept for  religious offerings) was challenged on the plea of improper succession. Issues raised, however, were of far greater significance than the properties included in the case. The ownership was decided in favor of Syedna, arguing succession proper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0226056767]; Mullahs on the Mainframe: Islam and Modernity Among the Daudi Bohras; By Jonah Blank; p-236,year 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0857735268];  Modern History of the Ismailis: Continuity and Change in a Muslim Community; edited by Farhad Daftary;  2010 - Social Science; legal battle with dissidents:-chandbhai case, internal dissent: legitimacy of nass on abdul qadi nazmuddin –nazim dai 50 yearts&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was also historic in the sense that similar [[Dawoodi Bohra#Intra-Bohra schisms|case]] was put up in the court of Mughal emperor [[Akbar]], in year 1591AD,  where representation was challenged on the legal point of proper accountability and proper succession resulting in royal farman(order) issued in favor of 27th Dai [[Dawood Bin Qutubshah]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010210004257/http://www.bohra.net/archive/ahmedabad.html]; History of Duat Mutlakin's of Ahmedabad&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, similar [[53rd Syedna succession controversy (Dawoodi Bohra)#Court cases|case]] moved to the high court in Mumbai to decide, valid succession of 53rd Syedna (Dai) of the Dawoodi Bohra community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/unique-case-from-akbar-s-court-in-1591-to-bombay-hc/story-u4QNPgu4wyYETNUSa2mjVN.html]; Unique case: From Akbar’s court in 1591 to Bombay HC&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Thomas Strangman observes in his book "Indian Courts and Characters",  the case is remarkable not only for its length, but for the amazing claims put forward on behalf of the 'Mullaji'(Syedna Taher), the like of which have never been put forward in any Court of Law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Indian_Courts_and_Characters.html?id=4JRCAAAAIAAJ]; Indian_Courts_and_Characters&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the Chandabhoy Galla Case, It was contended that 47th Dai Syedna [[Abdul Qadir Najmuddin]]  was not validly appointed as Dai al Mutlaq. If this contention was upheld by the court, then the position of all subsequent Dai al Mutlaqs would be put into question. Syedna [[Taher Saifuddin]]'s  claim to be the Dai al Mutlaq was dependent upon the court deciding that Syedna Najmuddin  was validly appointed. The court upheld the succession of [[Taher Saifuddin]] proper. Considering all the circumstances, the judge held that all the properties in respect of which the declaration was sought were devoted to charitable purposes and that the Mullaji(Syedna Taher) was a trustee thereof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/historicalcases/cases/MULLAJI_CASE.html]; MULLAJI CASE  (CHANDABHOY GULLA CASE)-19l8-19l9&lt;/ref&gt;

During the proceeding of the case, the remark of British judge Mr. Justice Marten is important on clarifying religious trust. The judge observed that "high-ranking people could be trusted not to commit criminal breach of trust; but that did not mean that they were beyond the pale of the law.  For example, His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, could not conceivably commit a criminal offence; but he was nevertheless subject to the criminal law, and this fact involved no slur.  So, too, in theory the Mullaji Saheb was amenable to the criminal and civil law of this country, though it was unthinkable that he would commit any offence. But the existence of this civil restraint is no more a slur upon an honest trustee, than the existence of criminal restraint is upon an honest citizen.  The test of a trust is not whether the alleged trustee can ever commit a breach of trust, which is what the defendants' contention in effect amounts to."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/historicalcases/cases/MULLAJI_CASE.html]; MULLAJI CASE  (CHANDABHOY GULLA CASE)-19l8-19l9&lt;/ref&gt;

During testimony of Syedna Taher, he clarified about knowledge classes of 'Zahir', 'Tavil' and, 'Hakikat' present in community. First two are known to many but third one namely 'Hakikat' content some religious truths known to very few. Some of which are known to only 2 or 3 persons in community, and there is also knowledge which is available with Dai only, and he gets it from his predecessor Dai.&lt;ref&gt; Record

'''Criticism of Protestantism''' covers critiques and questions raised about [[Protestantism]], the Christian tradition based on [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Protestant Reformation]]. While critics praise Protestantism's Christ-centered and Bible-centered faith, Protestantism is faced with criticism mainly from the [[Catholic Church]] and some [[Orthodox Church]]es, although Protestant denominations have also engaged in self-critique and criticized one another.&lt;ref name="christianitytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Fred Sanders |date=21 October 2016 |title=Does Protestantism Need to Die? |work=Christianity Today |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/november/does-protestantism-need-to-die.html?start=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic biblical critique asserts that the ''[[Sola scriptura]]'' principle of [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] [[List of Christian denominations#Protestantism|Churches]]&lt;ref name="Barber2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barber|first=John|title=The Road from Eden: Studies in Christianity and Culture|year=2008|publisher=Academica Press|language=English|isbn=9781933146348|page=233|quote=The message of the Lutheran and Reformed theologians has been codified into a simple set of five Latin phrases: ''Sola Scriptura'' (Scripture alone), ''Solus Christus'' (Christ alone), ''Sola Fide'' (faith alone), ''Sola Gratia'' (by grace alone) and ''Soli Deo Gloria'' (glory to God alone).}}&lt;/ref&gt; is inaccurate according to the Catholic doctrine.
While Catholic tradition agrees with Protestantism that faith, not works, is necessary for "initial" justification, some contemporary Protestant Scholars such as [[N.T. Wright]] affirm that both faith and works are necessary for justification.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_New_Perspectives.htm | title = New Perspectives on Paul | publisher = 10th Edinburgh Dogmatics Conference |date=August 2003 | first = N. T. | last = Wright}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic critics and [[Historical revisionism|revisionists]] also challenge the historicity of the [[Great Apostasy]], a premise of the Protestant Reformation.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2018}}

Protestants also engage in self-criticism, a special target of which is the fragmentation of Protestant denominations.&lt;ref name="christianitytoday.com"/&gt; In addition, due to the fact that Protestantism is not a monolithic tradition, some Protestant denominations criticize the beliefs of other Protestants. For example, the [[Continental Reformed church|Reformed Church]]es criticize the [[Methodist Church]]es for the latter denomination's belief in the doctrine of [[unlimited atonement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalystresources.org/why-wesley-and-not-calvin/|title=Why Wesley, and Not Calvin|last=Thorsen|first=Don|date=18 February 2015|publisher=Catalyst Resources|language=English|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[History of the Calvinist–Arminian debate|long-term debate between Calvinists and Arminians]].

== Criticism of foundational principles ==
=== ''Sola scriptura'' ===
[[File:Folio 109v - The Baptism of Christ.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jean Colombe]], ''Baptism of Christ'' (1485), [[Musée Condé]]]]

''[[Sola scriptura]]'', one of the [[Five solae|Five Principles]] shared by [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]] and [[Reformed Church]]es, originated during the [[Protestant Reformation]],&lt;ref name="Barber2008"/&gt; is a [[formal principle]] of many [[Protestant denominations]]. [[Baptists|Baptist Churches]] as well share the ''Sola scriptura'' principle and state that the [[Protestant Bible|Bible]] alone is the sole source of knowledge,&lt;ref name="SBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/basicbeliefs.asp |title=Basic Beliefs: The Scriptures |year=2018|publisher=[[Southern Baptist Convention]]|accessdate=13 August 2018|quote=The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God's revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of divine instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy. It reveals the principles by which God judges us, and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world the true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions should be tried. All Scripture is a testimony to Christ, who is Himself the focus of divine revelation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BWA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.dudasite.com/site/bwanet_1/default?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bwanet.org%2Fabout-us2%2Fcentennial-statement#2966|title=Centennial Statement: Centenary Congress (Birmingham, United Kingdom, July 2005)|year=2018|publisher=[[Baptist World Alliance]]|accessdate=13 August 2018|quote=We Declare that the divinely inspired Old and New Testament Scriptures have supreme authority as the written Word of God and are fully trustworthy for faith and conduct; [...] we declare, affirm and covenant to the Lord Jesus Christ and to each other, believing the truth found in Him and revealed in the Scriptures.

In contrast, the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Methodist Church]] uphold the doctrine of ''[[prima scriptura]]'', which holds that Sacred tradition, reason and experience are the sources of Christian doctrine, but are nonetheless subordinate to the authority of the Bible as well.&lt;ref name=WELS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wels.net/what-we-believe/questions-answers/christian/methodist-beliefs|title=Methodist Beliefs: In what ways are Lutherans different from United Methodists?|year=2014|publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|accessdate=22 May 2014|quote=The United Methodists see Scripture as the primary source and criterion for Christian doctrine. They emphasize the importance of tradition, experience, and reason for Christian doctrine. Lutherans teach that the Bible is the sole source for Christian doctrine. The truths of Scripture do not need to be authenticated by tradition, human experience, or reason. Scripture is self authenticating and is true in and of itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Humphrey2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Humphrey|first=Edith M.|title=Scripture and Tradition |date=15 April 2013|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=9781441240484|page=16|quote=historically Anglicans have adopted what could be called a ''Prima Scriptura'' position.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Benedict XVI]], the Catholic Church holds a very different view on the [[Catholic Bible|Bible]] and doesn't consider itself to be a "[[Abrahamic religions|Religion of the book]]": "while in the [Catholic] Church we greatly venerate the sacred Scriptures, the Christian faith is not a 'religion of the book': Christianity is the 'religion of the Word of God'...together with the Church’s living Tradition, [the Scripture] constitutes the supreme rule of faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Ratzinger|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20100930_verbum-domini.html|title=Verbum Domini: Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation on the Word of God in the Life and Mission of the Church|date=30 September 2010|website=Vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Justification by faith and grace alone ===
==== ''Sola fide'' ====
At "the crux of the disputes" are the [[Justification (theology)|doctrine on justification]] and ''[[Sola fide]]'',&lt;ref name="declaration"&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Lutheran World Federation]]|author2=[[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]]|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_31101999_cath-luth-joint-declaration_en.html|title=Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification|website=Vatican.va|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; two of the core principles of Protestantism.

The immediate official Catholic response to the Reformation, the [[Council of Trent]], affirmed in 1547 the foundational importance of faith as part of its doctrinal tradition, "we are therefore considered to be justified by faith, because faith is the beginning of human salvation, the foundation, and the root of all Justification...none of those things which precede justification --whether faith or works-- merit the grace itself of justification."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct06.html|title=CT06|website=History.hanover.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many centuries later, in 1999 the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] and the [[Lutheran World Federation]] have found basic doctrinal agreements in the ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'',&lt;ref name="declaration" /&gt; showing "a common understanding" of the justification:&lt;ref name="declaration" /&gt; "By grace alone, in faith in Christ's saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works."&lt;ref name="declaration" /&gt; The document states that the Churches now share "a common understanding of our justification by [[God the Father|God's]] grace through [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] in [[Christ]]."&lt;ref name="declaration" /&gt; To the parties involved, this essentially resolves the 500-year-old conflict over the nature of [[Justification (theology)|justification]] which was at the root of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[World Methodist Council]] formally recognized the ''Declaration'' in 2006.&lt;ref name=labarr&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.1863123/k.FF49/World_Methodists_approve_further_ecumenical_dialogue.htm |title=World Methodists approve further ecumenical dialogue |last=LaBarr |first=Joan G. |date=20 July 2006 |publisher=[[United Methodist Church]] |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721210415/http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.1863123/k.FF49/World_Methodists_approve_further_ecumenical_dialogue.htm |archive-date=21 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wooden&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0604186.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060725190303/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0604186.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 July 2006 |title=Methodists adopt Catholic-Lutheran declaration on justification |last=Wooden |first=Cindy |agency=[[Catholic News Service]] |date=24 July 2006 |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an important step forward in the [[Catholic–Lutheran dialogue]], the ''Declaration'' continues to show the unsurpassable differences of thought that separate the Catholic Church from the Protestant tradition.&lt;ref name="declaration" /&gt; Lutherans uphold Luther's doctrine that "human beings are incapable of cooperating in their salvation ... God justifies sinners in faith alone (''sola fide'')." 
According to [[N. T. Wright]], "[[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], in company with mainstream [[Second Temple Judaism]], affirms that God’s final judgment will be in accordance with the entirety of a life led — in accordance, in other words, with works.”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; [[Benedict XVI]] in 2006 declared that "it is to God and his grace alone that we owe what we are as Christians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Ratzinger|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2006/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20061108.html|title=General Audience of 8 November 2006: St Paul's new outlook|website=Vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Methodist Church]]es have always emphasized that ordinarily both faith and good works play a role in salvation; in particular, the [[works of piety]] and the [[works of mercy]], in Wesleyan-Arminian theology, are "indispensible for our [[Sanctification#Methodism|sanctification]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalystresources.org/wesley-on-faith-and-good-works/|title=Wesley on Faith and Good Works|last=Knight III|first=Henry H.|date=9 July 2013|publisher=Catalyst Resources|language=English|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodist Bishop [[Scott J. Jones]] in ''United Methodist Doctrine'' says that faith is always necessary to salvation unconditionally.&lt;ref name="Jones2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Scott J. |date=2002 |title=United Methodist Doctrine: The Extreme Center |url= |location=Nashville, TN |publisher=Abingdon Press |pp=187-191 |isbn=978-0-687-03485-7 |author-link=Scott J. Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good works are the exterior result of true faith but are necessary only conditionally, that is, if there is time and opportunity.&lt;ref name="Jones2002"/&gt;

==== Criticism of the ''Joint Declaration'' within the Catholic Church ====
The Vatican's note in response to the ''Declaration'' said that the Protestant formula "at the same time righteous and sinner", is not acceptable: "In baptism everything that is really sin is taken away, and so, in those who are born anew there is nothing that is hateful to God. It follows that the concupiscence [disordered desire] that remains in the baptised is not, properly speaking, sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Response of the Catholic Church to the Joint Declaration of the Catholic Church and the Lutheran World Federation on the Doctrine of Justification |website=Vatican.va|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_01081998_off-answer-catholic_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Catholic opinion on the Great Apostasy ====
{{See also|Antichrist#Protestant Reformation|Great Apostasy}}

According to Benedict XVI, the encounter of Christianity with [[Hellenistic period|enlightened Greek culture]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|philosophy]] is not [[Apostasy in Christianity|apostasy]] into [[Paganism]], but rather a natural development in the [[history of early Christianity|history of the early Church]];&lt;ref name="Ratzinger"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Joseph Ratzinger]]|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060912_university-regensburg.html|title=Apostolic Journey to München, Altötting and Regensburg: Meeting with the representatives of science in the Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg|date=12 September 2006|website=Vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratzinger also states that the [[Septuagint|translation of the Old Testament in Greek]] and the fact that the New Testament itself was written in Greek are a direct consequence of the biblical revelation's reception by the Hellenistic world.&lt;ref name="Ratzinger" /&gt;

==== Apostolic succession ====
Some Catholic critics{{who|date=August 2018}} state that Protestant acceptance of the Great Apostasy implies their non-acceptance of the [[apostolic succession]] in the Catholic Church and Orthodox Churches.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2018}} At the same time, a number of Protestant Churches, including Lutheran Churches, the [[Moravian Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]], affirm that they ordain their clergy in line with the apostolic succession;&lt;ref name="GuidryCrossing2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guidry|first1=Christopher R.|last2=Crossing|first2=Peter F.|title=World Christian Trends, AD 30-AD 2200: Interpreting the Annual Christian Megacensus|date=1 January 2001 |publisher=William Carey Library|isbn=9780878086085|page=307|quote=Very many other major episcopal churches, however-Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Old Catholic, Anglican, Scandinavian Lutheran-do make this claim and contend that a bishop cannot have regular or valid orders unless he has been consecrated in this apostolic succession.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1922, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] recognised Anglican orders as valid.&lt;ref name="WrightDutton2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=John Robert|last2=Dutton|first2=Marsha L.|last3=Gray|first3=Patrick Terrell|title=One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism: Studies in Christian Ecclesiality and Ecumenism |year=2006|publisher=[[Wm.

== Criticism of doctrine and practices ==
=== Eucharist ===
Some Catholic critics{{who|date=August 2018}} say that Protestant Churches, including the Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Reformed traditions, each teach a different form of the doctrine of the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]],&lt;ref name="M'Gavin1833"&gt;{{cite book|last=M'Gavin|first=William|title=The Protestant: Essays on the principal points of controversy between the Church of Rome and the Reformed|accessdate=17 September 2017|year=1833|publisher=Hutchison and Dwier|language=English|page=396|quote=... every Protestant church holds the doctrine of the ''real presence'', while it is expressed in this general form.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neal2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Neal|first=Gregory S.|title=Sacramental Theology and the Christian Life|date=19 December 2014|publisher=WestBow Press|language=English |isbn=9781490860077|page=111|quote=For Anglicans and Methodists the reality of the presence of Jesus as received through the sacramental elements is not in question.

Even more, in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith. The "real presence" of Christ in the Holy Sacrament is the means by which the union of faith, effected by God's Word and the sacrament of baptism, is strengthened and maintained.

=== Prayers for the dead ===

==Historical and ecclesiological critique==
Protestant Churches are considered by some Catholic critics as a negative force which "protests" and revolts against the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Pauck"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/004057364800500106|title=The Roman Catholic Critique of Protestantism
|first=Wilhelm|last=Pauck|date=1 April 1948|journal=Theology Today|volume=5|issue=1|pages=34–48|accessdate=11 August 2018|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/004057364800500106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic theologian [[Karl Adam (theologian)|Karl Adam]] wrote: "The sixteenth century revolt from the Church led inevitably to the revolt from Christ of the eighteenth century, and thence to the revolt from God of the nineteenth. And thus the modern spirit has been torn loose from the deepest and strongest supports of its life, from its foundation in the Absolute, in the self-existent Being, in the Value of all values... Instead of the man who is rooted in the Absolute, hidden in God, strong and rich, we have the man who rests upon himself, the autonomous man."&lt;ref name="Pauck"/&gt;

In response to Adam's accusation towards Protestantism, the [[church historian]] and Protestant theologian [[Wilhelm Pauck]] pointed out that "In summing up [...] the Roman Catholic criticism that the Reformation and Protestantism resulted from a revolt against the Church, we conclude that the Roman Catholic leaders of the sixteenth century are not without responsibility for the break-up of Christian unity",&lt;ref name="Pauck"/&gt; therefore the [[Schism]] between Protestants and Catholics was an inevitable consequence of the [[Protestant Reformation]] for which both sides have to be considered responsible.&lt;ref name="Pauck"/&gt;

==Langar==
{{Main article|Langar (Sikhism)}}
Within the gurdwara, the Guru ka Langar (Guru's community kitchen) serves purely [[lacto-vegetarian]] food because the Langar is open to all. Since people of many faiths with varying dietary taboos, and since Sikhs accept these restrictions and accommodate people regardless of their faith or culture, the Sikh Gurus adopt vegetarian food for Langar.

==The Sikh code of conduct on the Sikh diet ([[Rehat Maryada]])==

According to the Sikh code of conduct or [[Rehat Maryada]], Sikhs are free to choose whether or not to include meat in their diet.&lt;ref name="Sgpc.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.sgpc.net/sikh-rehat-maryada-in-english/ |title=Only Meat Killed by Ritual Is Banned for a Sikh |publisher=Sgpc.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikh intellectual views==

I. J. Singh states that throughout Sikh history, there have been many subsects of Sikhism that have espoused vegetarianism.

==Historical dietary behaviour of Sikhs==
There are a number of eyewitness accounts from European travelers as to the eating habits of Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;Siques, Tigers or Thieves  Parmjit Singh &amp; Amandeep Singh Madra {{ISBN|1-4039-6202-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Francklin in his writing about Mr George Thomas 1805: "They are not prohibited the use of Animal food of any kind, excepting Beef, which they are rigidly scrupulous in abstaining from."&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths writes on 17 February 1794: Now become a Singh, he is a heterodox, and distinct from the Hindoos by whom he is considered an apostate. He is not restricted in his diet, but is allowed, by the tenets of his new religion, to devour whatever food his appetite may prompt, excepting beef."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dabistan e Mazhib (a contemporary Persian chronology of the Sikh Gurus), Guru Nanak did not eat meat, and [[Guru Arjan]] thought that meat eating was not in accordance with Nanak's wishes. This differs from I. J. Singh's research that states that Guru Nanak ate meat on the way to [[Kurukshetra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sikhs and Sikhism |author=I. J. Singh |publisher=Manohar |location=Delhi| isbn=978-81-7304-058-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Persian records, Guru Hargobind (the 6th Guru) ate meat and hunted, and his practice was adopted by most Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Sikh History from Persian Sources: Translations of Major Texts |author=J.S. Grewal |isbn=978-81-85229-17-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sarbloh Bibek==
Many Sikhs keep Sarbloh Bibek. ''Sarbloh'' means all-[[iron]]{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} and ''Bibek'' meaning conscious principles{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}. Sikhs who follow this practice eat from iron bowls and iron plates only. According to Sarbloh Bibek, food must be cooked in iron cauldrons or other iron utensils while reciting [[Gurbani]] or [[Simran]] (meditating).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Sikh Review|year=2005|volume=53|issue=7-12; 619-624|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2013}} Sikhs traditionally use [[sand]] to clean the iron utensils, but today Sikhs speed up the process using a mixture of dishwashing soap, sand, water, and a  [[steel wool]] soap pad.

Another key aspect to maintaining Sarbloh Bibek is that Sikhs must only eat food prepared by other [[Amritdhari]] (baptized) Sikhs. Amritdhari Sikhs are also not to eat Jootha food (previously eaten food) from non-Amritdharis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Knut|title=Sikhs in Europe: Migration, Identities and Representations|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=9781409424345|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarbloh was used by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] to prepare Amrit during the Khalsa initiation ceremony in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=Shiv|title=Creation of the Khalsa: Fulfilment of Guru Nanak's Mission : Khalsa Tercentenary Commemorative Volume|year=1999|publisher=Punjabi University.

{{Liturgical year}}

In the [[liturgical calendar]] of the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] churches, '''Ember days''' are four separate sets of three days within the same week &amp;mdash; specifically, the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday &amp;mdash; roughly equidistant in the circuit of the year, that are set aside for [[fasting]] and prayer. These days set apart for special prayer and fasting were considered especially suitable for the ordination of clergy. The Ember Days are known in [[Latin]] as the '''quattuor anni tempora''' (the "four seasons of the year"), or formerly as the ''jejunia quattuor temporum'' ("fasts of the four seasons").

The four quarterly periods during which the ember days fall are called the '''embertides'''.

==Etymology==
Ember days have their origin in the Latin ''Quatuor Tempora'' (four times).&lt;ref name=Mershman&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05399b.htm Mershman, Francis. "Ember Days." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 15 Sept. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various views as to etymology. According to J. M. Neale in ''Essays of Liturgiology'' (1863), Chapter X:
{{quote|"The Latin name has remained in modern languages, though the contrary is sometimes affirmed, ''Quatuor Tempora'', the Four Times. In French and Italian the term is the same; in Spanish and Portuguese they are simply ''Temporas''. The German converts them into ''Quatember'', and thence, by the easy corruption of dropping the first syllable, a corruption which also takes place in some other words, we get the English Ember. Thus, there is no occasion to seek after an etymology in embers; or with Nelson, to extravagate still further to the noun ''ymbren'', a recurrence, as if all holy seasons did not equally recur. Ember-week in [[Wales]] is {{lang-cy|"Wythnos y cydgorian"}}, meaning "the Week of the Processions". In mediæval Germany they were called ''Weihfasten'', ''Wiegfastan'', ''Wiegefasten'', or the like, on the general principle of their sanctity.... We meet with the term ''Frohnfasten'', ''frohne'' being the then word for travail. Why they were named ''foldfasten'' it is less easy to say."}}

Neil and Willoughby in ''The Tutorial Prayer Book'' (1913) prefer the view that it derives from the Anglo-Saxon ''ymbren'', a circuit or revolution (from ''ymb'', around, and ''ryne'', a course, running), clearly relating to the annual cycle of the year. The word occurs in such  Anglo-Saxon compounds as ''ymbren-tid'' ("Embertide"), ''ymbren-wucan'' ("Ember weeks"), ''ymbren-fisstan'' ("Ember fasts"), ''ymbren-dagas'' ("Ember days").  The word ''imbren'' even makes it into the acts of the "Council of Ænham"&lt;ref&gt;More correctly a [[synod]], convoked by King [[Ethelred the Unready|Ethelred]]. "Aenham" was identified as "probably Ensham, in Oxfordshire" by [[Thomas Lathbury]], ''A History of the Convocation of the Church of England'' 1842:54. The site would have been the [[Eynsham Abbey|Abbey of Eynsham]] rather than the [[Eynsham|town]].&lt;/ref&gt; (1009): ''jejunia quatuor tempora quae imbren vocant'', "the fasts of the four seasons which are called "imbren'".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911, ''s.v.'' "Ember Days"&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds also with [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo the Great's]] definition, ''jejunia ecclesiastica per totius anni circulum distributa'' ("fasts of the church distributed through the whole ''circuit of the year''").

Folk etymology even cites the phrase "may ye rem''ember'' (the inevitability of death)" as the source.

==Origins==
The term ''Ember days'' refers to three days set apart for fasting, abstinence, and prayer during each of the four seasons of the year.&lt;ref name=Hardon&gt;[https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=868 Hardon, S.J.,  John. "Explanation of Ember Days", ''Modern Catholic Dictionary'', Doubleday, 1980]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of their introduction was to thank God for the gifts of nature, to teach men to make use of them in moderation, and to assist the needy.&lt;ref name=Mershman/&gt; 

Possibly occasioned by the agricultural feasts of ancient Rome, they came to be observed by Christians for the sanctification of the different seasons of the year.&lt;ref name=Hardon/&gt; James G. Sabak argues that the Embertide vigils were "...not based on imitating agrarian models of pre-Christian Roman practices, but rather on an eschatological rendering of the year punctuated by the solstices and equinoxes, and thus underscores the eschatological significance of all liturgical vigils in the city of Rome."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuislandora.wrlc.org/islandora/object/etd%3A290 Sabak, James George. ''The Theological Significance of "Keeping Vigil" in Rome From the Fourth to the Eighth Centuries'', Catholic University of America, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the [[Diocese of Rome|Church in Rome]] had fasts in June, September, and December. The ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' ascribes to [[Pope Callixtus I]] (217-222) a law regulating the fast, although [[Leo the Great]] (440-461) considers it an [[Apostles|Apostolic]] institution. When the fourth season was added cannot be ascertained, but [[Pope Gelasius I]] (492-496) speaks of all four. The earliest mention of four seasonal fasts is known from the writings of [[Philastrius, bishop of Brescia]] (died ca 387) (''De haeres.'' 119). He also connects them with the great Christian festivals.

As the Ember Days came to be associated with great feast days, they later lost their connection to agriculture and came to be regarded solely as days of penitence and prayer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4gMPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=embertide&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qjM5Tk-GGI&amp;sig=WkzYPjuyaOBtejt0pwrRxgJMX6I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOi6eD_6DPAhWIWD4KHajuAAM4KBDoAQhLMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=embertide&amp;f=false Kellner, Karl Adam Heinrich. ''Heortology: A History of the Christian Festivals from Their Origin to the Present Day'', 1908]&lt;/ref&gt; It is only the Michaelmas Embertide, which falls around the autumn harvest, that retains any connection to the original purpose.  

The Christian observance of the seasonal Ember days had its origin as an ecclesiastical ordinance in Rome and spread from there to the rest of the Western Church. They were known as the ''jejunium vernum, aestivum, autumnale and hiemale'', so that to quote Pope Leo's words (A.D. 440 - 461) the law of abstinence might apply to every season of the year. In Leo's time, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday were already days of special observance. In order to tie them to the fasts preparatory to the three great festivals of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost, a fourth needed to be added "for the sake of symmetry" as the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911 has it.

From Rome the Ember days gradually spread unevenly through the whole of Western Christendom. In [[Gaul]] they do not seem to have been generally recognized much before the 8th century.

Their observance in Britain, however, was embraced earlier than in Gaul or Spain, and Christian sources connect the Ember Days observance with [[Augustine of Canterbury]], AD. 597, said to be acting under the direct authority of Pope Gregory the Great. The precise dates appears to have varied considerably however, and in some cases, quite significantly, the Ember Weeks lost their connection with the Christian festivals altogether. [[Spain]] adopted them with the [[Roman rite]] in the eleventh century. [[Charles Borromeo]] introduced them into [[Milan]] in the sixteenth century.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], ember days have never been observed. Yet in [[Western Rite Orthodoxy]], which is in full communion with the Eastern Orthodox, the Ember days are observed.&lt;ref name=Mershman/&gt;

== Ember Weeks ==
The '''Ember Weeks''', the weeks in which the Ember Days occur, are these weeks:
*between the third and fourth Sundays of [[Advent]] (although the [[Common Worship]] lectionary of the [[Church of England]] places them in the week following the ''second'' Sunday in Advent);
*between the first and second Sundays of [[Lent]];
*between [[Pentecost]] and [[Trinity Sunday]]; and
*the liturgical Third Week of September. According to an old way of counting, the first Sunday of a month (a datum important to determine the appropriate [[Matins]] readings) was considered the Sunday ''proximate to'', not ''on or after'', the first of the month, so this yielded as Ember Week precisely the week containing the Wednesday after [[Holy Cross Day]] (September 14), and as Ember Days said Wednesday and the following Friday and Saturday. It has been preserved in that order by [[Western Rite Orthodoxy]]&lt;ref&gt; http://www.stjohnbaptistorthodox.org/files/calendar/2015-Western-Rite-Calendar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and Anglicans.&lt;ref&gt;1928 Book of Common Prayer: "The Ember Days at the Four Seasons, being the Wednesday, Friday. and Saturday after the First Sunday in Lent, the Feast of Pentecost, September 14, and December 13."&lt;/ref&gt; Yet for [[Roman Catholic]]s, a 20th-century reform of the [[Breviary]] shifted the First Sunday in September to what the name literally implies, and by implication, Ember Week to the Week beginning with the Sunday after Holy Cross day. Therefore, in a year that September 14 falls on a Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday, the Ember Days for Western Rite Orthodox and Anglicans are a week sooner than for those of modern-day Catholics.

==Timing==
The ''Ordo Romanus'' fixed the spring fast in the first week of March (then the first month), thus loosely associated with the first Sunday in Lent; the summer fast in the second week of June, after [[Pentecost|Whitsunday]]; the autumnal fast in the third week of September following the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], September 14; and the winter fast in the complete week next before Christmas Eve, following [[Saint Lucy's Day|St. Lucy's Day]] (Dec. 13).

Other regulations prevailed in different countries, until the inconveniences arising from the want of uniformity led to the rule now observed being laid down under [[Pope Urban II]] as the law of the church, at the [[Council of Piacenza]] and the [[Council of Clermont]], 1095.

These dates are given in the following mnemonic:
:''Sant Crux, Lucia, Cineres, Charismata Dia''
:''Ut sit in angariâ quarta sequens feria''

Or in an old English rhyme
:"Fasting days and Emberings be
:Lent, Whitsun, Holyrood, and Lucie."

The ember days began on the Wednesday immediately following those days. This meant, for instance, that if September 14 were a Tuesday, the ember days would occur on September 15, 17, and 18. As a result, the ember days in September could fall after either the second or third Sunday in September. This, however, was always the liturgical Third Week of September, since the First Sunday of September was the Sunday closest to September 1 (August 29 to September 4). As a simplification of the liturgical calendar, [[Pope John XXIII]] modified this so that the Third Sunday was the third Sunday actually within the calendar month. Thus if September 14 were a Sunday, September 24, 26 and 27 would be ember days, the latest dates possible; with September 14 as a Saturday, however, the ember days would occur on September 18, 20 and 21 - the earliest possible dates.

Prior to the reforms instituted after the [[Second Vatican Council]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] mandated [[Fasting and Abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|fasting]] (only one full meal per day plus two partial, meatless meals) on all Ember Days (which meant both fasting and [[abstinence]] from meat on Ember Fridays), and the faithful were encouraged (though not required) to receive the [[sacrament]] of [[penance]] whenever possible. On February 17, 1966, [[Pope Paul VI]]'s decree [[Paenitemini]] excluded the Ember Days as days of fast and abstinence for Roman Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica article [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9322440 ''Ember days'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The revision of the liturgical calendar in 1969 laid down the following rules for Ember Days and [[Rogation days]]:

{{quote|"In order that the Rogation Days and Ember Days may be adapted to the different regions and different needs of the faithful, the Conferences of Bishops should arrange the time and manner in which they are held. Consequently, concerning their duration, whether they are to last one or more days, or be repeated in the course of the year, norms are to be established by the competent authority, taking into consideration local needs. The Mass for each day of these celebrations should be chosen from among the Masses for Various Needs, and should be one which is more particularly appropriate to the purpose of the supplications."&lt;ref&gt;''Universal Norms of the Liturgical Year and the Calendar'', nos. 46-47 (2010 ICEL translation); for the Latin text see [http://www.binetti.ru/collectio/liturgia/missale_files/deanno3ed.htm ''Normae universales de anno liturgico et de calendario'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

They may appear in some calendars as "days of prayer for peace".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/em/emberday.html Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212114040/http://www.bartleby.com/65/em/emberday.html |date=2007-02-12 }} at Bartleby dot com&lt;/ref&gt;

They were made optional by churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] in 1976.  In the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the September Ember Days are still (optionally) observed on the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday after Holy Cross Day,&lt;ref&gt;1979 Book of Common Prayer, p. 18: "The Ember Days, traditionally observed on the Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays after the First Sunday in Lent, the Day of Pentecost, Holy Cross Day, and December 13"&lt;/ref&gt; so that if September 14 is a Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday, the Ember Days fall on the following Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday (in the second week of September) whereas they fall a week later (in the third week of September) for the Roman Catholic Church.

Some Lutheran church calendars continue the observation of Ember and Rogation days, though the practice has diminished over the past century.

==Ordination of clergy==
{{main article|Ordination}}

The rule that ordination of clergy should take place in the Ember weeks was set in documents traditionally associated with Pope Gelasius I (492-496), the pontificate of Archbishop Ecgbert of York, A.D. 732 - 766, and referred to as a canonical rule in a capitulary of Charlemagne. It was finally established as a law of the church in the pontificate of [[Pope Gregory VII]], ''ca'' 1085.

However, why Ember Saturdays are traditionally associated with ordinations (other than episcopal ones), by the time of at the latest [[Code of Canon Law (1917)|1917]], major orders could also be conferred on the Saturday preceding [[Passion Sunday]], and on the [[Easter Vigil]]; for grave reasons; on Sundays and [[Holy Day of Obligation|holy days of obligation]]; and, for [[minor orders]], even without grave reason, on all Sundays and double feasts (which included most saints' feasts and thus the great majority of the calendar).&lt;ref&gt;See can. 1006, CIC 1917&lt;/ref&gt; Present canon law prefers them to be conferred on Sundays and holy days of obligation, but allows them for pastoral reason on any day. &lt;ref&gt; See can. 1010, CIC 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice the use of Saturdays, though not necessarily Ember Saturdays, still prevails. Subsequently, [[Pentecost Vigil]] and the feast of [[Saints Peter and Paul|Sts. Peter and Paul]] (and Saturdays around it) have come much in use as ordination days.

==History==
[[Image:Fun at devils bathtub.jpg|thumb|250px|Visitors explore Boulder Springs at Falls Creek]]

Falls Creek was established in the summer of 1917, when J.B. Rounds and W. D. Moorer used donated land to host the meeting of the Baptist Young People's Union, with a total of 273 campers.  Since then, Falls Creek has grown astronomically, now averaging 55,000 attendees each summer. In the 1920s, a large outdoor tabernacle was built and remained in use for many years. In 2004, this tabernacle was torn down and construction began on a new one, with services during the 2005 and 2006 sessions being held at an amphitheater. Benches from the old tabernacle, which had been signed by generations of campers, were sold as collector's items. In 2007, the new tabernacle was opened at the 90th Falls Creek session and was the first facility indoors and with [[Public toilet|rest rooms]]. Former Rep. and now US Senator [[James Lankford]] (R-OK) was Program Director for Falls Creek between 1996 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jameslankford.com/about/biography|title=Biography|work=JamesLankford.com|accessdate=February 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312083945/http://www.jameslankford.com/about/biography|archivedate=March 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
Falls Creek emanates from springs of the Arbuckle aquifer and flows over several waterfalls, the most notable being Price Falls, before dumping into the [[Washita River]]. The geologic formations surrounding Falls Creek have been dated to the [[Ordovician]] and contain many fossils of organisms that lived during that time. A large [[graben]] is present in the camp which contains the [[Clastic rock|clastic]] materials of the Royer Dolomite which underwent karsting and was redeposited during the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] as the Collins Ranch Conglomerate.

===Indian Falls Creek===
Since 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.bgco.org/docushare/dsweb/GetRendition/Document-13068/html|title=Indian walk across state to help Falls Creek|author=Koonce, Brian|work=Baptist Messenger|date=2002-08-15|accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falls Creek has hosted a special annual gathering, called "Indian Falls Creek", of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Christian]]s from Christian churches of all denominations across and outside of the United States, and from many churches residing within the state of Oklahoma.

It is chaired and directed by Native American pastors Bill Barnett and Victor Cope. An annual [[blood donation|blood drive]] and [[National Marrow Donor Program|bone marrow registry]] are also held at this time to increase contributions and minority representation to the repository&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shawnee.kfor.com/content/indian-falls-creek-host-blood-drive |publisher=kfor.com |title=Indian Falls Creek to host blood drive |author=Querry, Kim |date=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2010-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713145107/http://shawnee.kfor.com/content/indian-falls-creek-host-blood-drive |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide better matches for those in need, with the blood being stored at the Oklahoma Blood Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallscreekok.org/index.php?id=15|title=Native Americans from 20 States join together at Indian Falls Creek|author=Williamson, Dana|date=2006-08-14|accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other ministries===
[[Major League Baseball]] umpires Ted Barrett and Rob Drake, together with Reverend Dean Esskew, founded "Calling for Christ", an organization ministering to professional umpires. In 2001, Barrett and Drake were introduced to Esskew at a conference in Denver where Esskew told them about Falls Creek's facilities. They decided
to hold their first retreat at Falls Creek and have returned for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpsports.net/bpsports.asp?ID=5643|publisher=BPSports.net|title=Growing number of umpires are ‘Calling for Christ’|author=Williamson, Dana|date=2007-08-15|accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080509&amp;content_id=2668657&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|publisher=MLB.com|title=Umpires bring smiles to sick children|date=2008-05-09|accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tragedy===
In August 2010, a 20-year-old camper from [[Wichita, Kansas]] named Moses Fitchpatrick broke off from his hiking group and went missing. His body was found several days later, two miles south of the Falls Creek property, in rough terrain. The cause of death was undetermined, but likely to have been a result of heat and [[dehydration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/relatives-said-they-were-told-falls-creek-hiker-likely-died-of-heat-and-dehydration/article/3484176|publisher=NewsOk.com|title=Relatives said they were told Falls Creek hiker likely died of heat and dehydration|author=Pittman, Jim|date=2010-08-11|accessdate= 2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4752">'''Flower Communion''' is a [[ritual]] service common in [[Unitarian Universalism]], though the specific practices vary from one congregation to another.&lt;ref name=zottoli&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.uua.org/documents/zottolireginald/flowercommunion.pdf |title="The Flower Communion: A Service of Celebration for Religious Liberals" }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(183&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, by Reginald Zottoli&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually held before summer, when some congregations recess from holding services. During the ritual, congregants contribute flowers to a central location, and later the flowers are distributed among the participants. 

==History==
The Flower Celebration was initiated in Prague on 4 June 1923 by [[Norbert Čapek]], who was also the founder of the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Church in [[Czechoslovakia]]. He saw the need to unite the diverse congregants of his church, from varying [[Protestant]], [[Catholic]], and [[Jewish]] backgrounds, without alienating those who had left these traditions. For this reason he honored the universal beauty of nature by having a communion of flowers instead of the [[Eucharist]]. Though Unitarian Universalists often refer to the ritual as a Flower Ceremony, Festival, or Communion, Čapek's term "Oslava Květin" is more accurately translated as "Flower Celebration," a term which continues to be preferred by Czech Unitarians today.&lt;ref name=Fragile&gt;[http://clf.uua.org/quest/2002-06.html#becelaere "Fragile and Rooted"], by Joan Van Becelaere, ''CLF Quest'', June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual was brought to the United States in 1940 by the Rev. Maja Čapek, Norbert's wife,&lt;ref name=zottoli /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fragile /&gt; and was widely adopted by the American Unitarian churches, and their successor Unitarian Universalist congregations.&lt;ref name=zottoli /&gt; Earlier Unitarian "Flower Services," documented in Midwestern U.S. Unitarian congregations beginning circa 1880, were somewhat different in form from Čapek's service.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

[[Image:The collection of our floral unity.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A floral arrangement created for a Flower Communion at a Unitarian Universalist Church for Easter celebrations 2009]]

==A sample Flower Communion==
In its essentials, the ritual involves the following: each congregant brings a flower to be used in the service; congregants leave their flowers in a central location either as they enter or during the service. Early in the service the bouquets of flowers are carried in, often by children. Towards the end of the service, the flowers are distributed or congregants come forward and choose a flower different from the one they brought.

The actual order of service varies widely in different congregations, and often closely resembles the ordinary order of service. Other service elements might include a sermon, the blessing of or a prayer over the flowers, a reading by Norbert Čapek, the history of the ritual, hymns, etc.

Many congregations include this blessing used by Čapek to consecrate the flowers before they are passed to or distributed among the people:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Infinite Spirit of Life, we ask thy blessing on these, thy messengers of fellowship and love. May they remind us, amid diversities of knowledge and of gifts, to be one in desire and affection, and devotion to thy holy will. May they also remind us of the value of comradeship, of doing and sharing alike. May we cherish friendship as one of thy most precious gifts. May we not let awareness of another's talents discourage us, or sully our relationship, but may we realize that, whatever we can do, great or small, the efforts of all of us are needed to do thy work in this world."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Symbolism==
As with the [[flaming chalice]] there is no one orthodox interpretation of this flower ritual. The beauty and diversity of flowers is seen as symbolic of the beauty and diversity of life. Czech Unitarian Iva Fišerová has written: "The flower is the most beloved symbol for Czech Unitarians... The symbol of various unique beings -- flowers/people -- uniting to create a unique bouquet... Parting and being given a flower as a symbol of anybody in attendance whom I am expected to accept as my brother or sister."&lt;ref&gt;[http://clf.uua.org/quest/2002-06.html#fi%C5%A1erov%C3%A1 "The Flower Celebration"], by Iva Fišerová (Member [[Church of the Larger Fellowship]], Prague, Czech Republic), ''CLF Quest'', June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Status of religious freedom}}

The [[Constitution of Belarus|Constitution]] provides for freedom of religion; however, the [[Government of Belarus|Government]] restricted this right in practice.

Respect for religious freedom has recently worsened. The Government continued to restrict religious freedom in accordance with the provisions of a 2002 law on religion and a 2003 concordat with the [[Belarusian Orthodox Church]] (BOC), a branch of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (ROC) and the only officially recognized Orthodox denomination. Although there is no state religion, the concordat grants the BOC privileged status. Protestants in particular attracted negative attention, presumably for their perceived links with the United States. Numerous anti-Semitic acts and attacks on religious monuments, buildings, and cemeteries occurred with little discernible response from the Government. Authorities kept many religious communities waiting as long as several years for decisions about property registration or restitution. Authorities also harassed and fined members of certain religious groups, especially those that the authorities appeared to regard as bearers of foreign cultural influence or as having a political agenda. Foreign missionaries, clergy, and humanitarian workers affiliated with churches faced many government-imposed obstacles, including deportation and visa refusal or cancellation.

While some members of society took positive actions to promote religious freedom, instances of [[societal abuses]] and [[religious discrimination|discrimination]] occurred, including numerous acts of vandalism and arson of religious sites, buildings, and memorials.

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Belarus}}

The country has an area of {{convert|207600|km2}} and it had a population of 9,498,400 on 1 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belarus.by/en/about-belarus/key-facts |title=Key facts about Belarus |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=© BELARUS.BY, 2009 - 2017 |access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically it has been an area of both interaction and conflict between Belarusian Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, although relations between the two groups improved during the period covered by this report. January 2007 figures from the Office of the Plenipotentiary Representative for Religious and Nationality Affairs (OPRRNA) showed that approximately 50 percent of Belarusians consider themselves religious. The Government claimed that of persons professing a religious faith, approximately 80 percent belong to the BOC, 14 percent identify themselves with the Catholic Church, 4 percent are members of eastern religious groups (including Muslims, Hare Krishnas, and Baha'i), and 2 percent are Protestant (including Seventh-day Adventists, Old Believers, Jehovah's Witnesses, Apostolic Christians, and Lutherans). Of those who identify themselves as Belarusian Orthodox or Roman Catholic, only 18 percent and 50 percent, respectively, regularly attend religious services. There are also adherents of the Greek Catholic Church and of Orthodox groups other than the BOC. Jewish groups claimed that between 50,000 and 70,000 persons identify themselves as Jewish. Most Jews were not religiously active.

In January 2007 OPRRNA reported 3,103 religious organizations of 25 religious confessions and denominations in the country, including 2,953 registered religious communities and 150 national and confessional organizations (monasteries, brotherhoods, missionaries, etc.). This included 1,399 Belarusian Orthodox, 493 Evangelical Christian, 440 Roman Catholic, 267 Evangelical Christian Baptist, 74 Seventh-day Adventist, 54 Full Gospel Christians, 33 Old Believer, 29 Jewish, 27 Lutheran, 26 Jehovah's Witness, 24 Muslim, 21 New Apostolic Church, 17 Progressive Judaism, 13 Greek Catholic, 9 Apostolic Christians, 6 Hare Krishnas, 5 Baha'i, 5 Christ's Church, 4 Mormon, 2 Messianic, 1 Reform Church, 1 Presbyterian, 1 Armenian Apostolic, 1 Latin Catholic, and 1 St. Jogan Church communities.

Foreign clergy and missionaries attempted to operate in the country but were subject to deportation and visa refusal or cancellation.

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; however, the Government restricted this right in practice. Although the 1996 amended Constitution affirms the equality of religions and denominations before the law, it also contains restrictive language stipulating that cooperation between the state and religious organizations "is regulated with regard for their influence on the formation of spiritual, cultural, and state traditions of the Belarusian people." OPRRNA regulates all religious matters.

In 2002 President Lukashenko signed a religion law despite protests from human rights organizations, the European Union, and domestic religious groups. The law recognizes the "determining role of the Orthodox Church in the historical formation and development of spiritual, cultural, and state traditions of the Belarusian people" as well as the historical importance of Catholicism, Judaism, Islam, and Evangelical Lutheranism, groups commonly referred to as "traditional faiths." However, the traditional faiths mentioned by the law do not include religious groups such as the Priestless Old Believers and Calvinist churches, which have historical roots in the country dating to the 17th century.

Despite the law's guarantee of religious freedom, it contains a number of restrictive elements that increase the Government's control of the activities of religious groups. The law requires all religious groups to receive prior governmental approval to import and distribute literature, prevents foreigners from leading religious organizations, and denies religious communities the right to establish schools to train their own clergy. In addition, the law confines the activity of religious communities to areas where they are registered and establishes complex registration requirements that some communities, both "traditional" and "nontraditional," have difficulty fulfilling. The law also required all previously registered groups to reregister by 2004 and bans all religious activity by unregistered groups.

The religion law establishes three tiers of religious groups: religious communities, religious associations, and republican religious associations. Religious communities, or local individual religious organizations, must include at least 20 persons over the age of 18 who live in neighboring areas. Religious associations must include at least 10 religious communities, one of which must have been active in the country for at least 20 years, and may be constituted only by a republican (national level) religious association. Republican religious associations can be formed only when there are active religious communities in the majority of the country's six regions.

A religious community must submit a list of its founders' names, places of residence, citizenship, and signatures, along with copies of its founding statutes, minutes of its founding meeting, and permission from the regional authorities confirming the community's right to occupy or use any property indicated in its founding statutes. Regional executive committees (for groups outside of Minsk) or the Minsk City Executive Committee handle all registration applications. For a community practicing a religion not previously "known" to the Government, information about the faith must also be submitted. No previously "unknown" religious communities were registered during the reporting period.

A religious association must provide a list of members of the managing body with biographical information, proof of permission for the association to be at its designated location, and minutes from its founding congress. Religious associations have the exclusive right to establish religious educational institutions, invite foreigners to work with religious groups, and organize cloistered and monastic communities. All applications to establish associations and republican associations must be submitted to OPRRNA. The Government registered five republican religious organizations during the reporting period. Domestic religious groups continued to call for revocation of at least part of the 2002 law. Christian communities maintained that the law heavily restricts their activities, suppresses freedom of religion, and legalizes criminal prosecution of individuals for their religious beliefs.

The 2003 concordat between the BOC and the Government guarantees the BOC autonomy in its internal affairs, freedom to perform religious rites and other activities, and a special relationship with the state. The concordat recognizes the BOC's "influence on the formation of spiritual, cultural, and national traditions of the Belarusian people." It calls for the Government and the BOC to cooperate in implementing policy in various fields, including education, development and protection of cultural legacies, and security. Although it states that the agreement would not limit the religious freedoms of other religious groups, the concordat calls for the Government and the BOC to combat unnamed "pseudoreligious structures that present a danger to individuals and society." In addition, the BOC possesses the exclusive right to use the word "Orthodox" in its title and to use the image of the Cross of Euphrosynia, the patron saint of the country, as its symbol.

On January 8, 2007, President Lukashenko honored several BOC members with "For Spiritual Revival" awards in recognition of their efforts to develop "moral traditions which contribute to the spiritual values…between various nationalities and religions." In a meeting with BOC bishops on December 21, 2006, President Lukashenko praised the cooperation between the Government and the BOC and stressed their common goals of civil accord and national unity. The President also noted the Government's assistance to the BOC: in 2006 the Government funded $3 million (6.4 billion rubles) in BOC projects.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
The Government restricted religious freedom both actively and indirectly. The Government enforced laws that limit freedom of worship, speech, and assembly. The Government was sometimes responsible for and regularly failed to condemn acts of religious insensitivity or intolerance. The Government frequently referred to groups it did not consider to be traditional as "nontraditional," and government officials and state media widely used the term "sect" when referring to such groups, although it is not an official designation. Foreign missionaries, clergy, and charity workers faced increased government obstacles, including deportation and visa refusal or revocation. With or without official registration, some religious groups encountered difficulty renting or purchasing property to establish places of worship, building churches, or reacquiring state-controlled religious property. The [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim Community is banned in Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwrn.org/articles/7039/ | title=BELARUS: Ahmadiyya Muslims among banned religious organisations | date=November 4, 2003 | accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forum 18 reported that the BOC and government officials pressured the parishioners of the unregistered Russian Orthodox Church Abroad (ROCA), which split from the BOC in 1927, to withdraw their names from the ROCA's registration application. If even 1 of the 20 signatories of the application were to withdraw his or her name, ROCA would be forced to start the process again. ROCA stated that from August to October 2006, two Moscow Patriarchate priests threatened to withhold sacraments from the parishioners if they continued supporting the "illegal and uncanonical sect." ROCA claimed that the two priests received the parishioners' names from local authorities.

On September 14, 2006, Pastor Sergei Heil, chair of the unregistered Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church in the Republic of Belarus, reported that the Government refused to register it as a republic-wide association. The Church has tried since October 2004 to register as an association and held four founding sessions in Bobruysk to comply with the registration requirements. OPRRNA maintained that there were "technical errors" in its application.

Many "traditional" and "nontraditional" religious groups continued to experience problems obtaining property or registering property, particularly when attempting to convert residential property for religious use. According to the Government, the law permits residential property to be used for religious services only after it has been converted from residential use. The housing code permits the use of such property for nonresidential purposes with the permission of local executive and administrative bodies. As a result, several Protestant churches and "nontraditional" groups were at an impasse: denied permission to convert their properties for religious use because they were not registered, but unable to register due to the lack of a legal address. Such groups often were forced to meet illegally or in the homes of individual members.

On March 22, 2007, the Supreme Economic Court adjourned indefinitely a case involving the New Life Church in Minsk. The New Life Church faced closure because authorities refused to register it at the cow barn it owned and wished to use for worship; its unregistered status made all its activities illegal. To protest a July 24, 2006, order by the Minsk City Economic Court to sell the church building to the city at a price far below market value and to vacate the premises by October 8, 2006, New Life Church members and sympathizers began a 23-day hunger strike, which prompted the authorities to review their decision. With the permission of Minsk local authorities, approximately 700 New Life Church parishioners and supporters rallied on Bangalore Square on October 21, 2006, to protest the forced sale. The case remained under consideration at the end of the reporting period.

On December 6, 2006, Grodno authorities granted permission for the Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of Mercy Roman Catholic community to build a church for its 8,000-member parish, which had been worshipping in a small wooden house that could accommodate only 300 persons. Twelve members of the church had launched a hunger strike on December 1, 2006, and continued it until authorities agreed to their request. The community first applied for permission to build a church in 1998.

On December 4, 2006, the Minsk Community of Krishna Consciousness (the Hare Krishnas) was forced out of its office in a vehicle service station following an inspection by the sanitary and emergency management authorities. The inspectors, however, allowed all other tenants to remain. The Minsk and Bobruysk Hare Krishna communities had searched for a legal address since being denied registration in 2004. They had attempted to register at the vehicle service station, but in November 2006 authorities denied the application.

On July 15, 2006, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal of Pastor Georgiy Vyazovskiy against the closure of his Christ Covenant Reformed Baptist Church. The Minsk City Court closed the church in May 2006 because the congregation had attempted to register at a residential building in violation of the law's mandate that all religious groups be registered at a "legal" address.

A government decree specifies measures to ensure public order and safety during general public gatherings. Some meeting hall officials cited the decree as a basis for canceling or refusing to extend agreements with religious groups for the use of their facilities. During the reporting period it remained difficult, particularly for unregistered groups, to rent a public facility. Protestant communities suffered most from this decree, since they were less likely to own their own property and needed to rent public space when their members were too numerous to meet in private homes.

On June 25, 2007, the Minsk Tsentralniy District informed John the Baptist Church that it could not rent space at the state Trade Unions House, allegedly due to scheduling conflicts.

Between February 2006 and the end of the reporting period, the charismatic Living Word Church in Grodno tried at least seven times to rent meeting space, but state proprietors refused each attempt.

On December 28, 2006, State Ideology Officer Oleg Bobryk interrupted without explanation a seminar on family relationships held by a Protestant preacher at the Volozhyn Palace of Culture. Volozhyn authorities dismissed 15 Palace of Culture employees that same day. Vefil Evangelical Christian Baptist Pastor Sergey Yasku alleged the dismissals were an attempt by government officials to "eliminate any cooperation of evangelical Christians with public organizations."

The Government restricted peaceful assembly for religious activities during the reporting period. On June 4, 2007, the Minsk City Executive Committee denied permission for the unregistered Belarus Christian Democracy party (BCD) to stage a June 8 rally protesting authorities' crackdown on freedom of conscience on Freedom Square. In April 2007 authorities similarly denied the BCD permission to stage a rally in support of religious freedom.

There were credible reports that local authorities and teachers sought to identify which children attended Baptist Sunday school. According to Forum 18, Baptist pastor Gennady Brutskiy alleged that children identified as having attended Baptist Sunday school were threatened by the head teacher. Similarly, Pastor Yasku claimed State Ideology Officer Bobryk demanded that teachers find out whether their students attended Protestant Sunday school. If children attended such a school, the teachers had to "have a talk" with their parents.

During the reporting period, the Government monitored peaceful minority religious groups, especially those perceived as "foreign" or "cults." Credible sources reported that state security officers often attended Protestant services to conduct surveillance.

Approval for visits by foreign religious workers often involved a lengthy bureaucratic process. The law requires 1-year, multiple-entry "spiritual activities" visas for foreign missionaries and clergy. An organization inviting foreign clergy must make a written request to OPRRNA, including the proposed dates and reason for the requested visit. Even if the visit is for nonreligious purposes such as charitable activities, representatives must obtain a visa and permission from OPRRNA. OPRRNA has 20 days in which to respond, and there is no provision for appeal of its decision.

Observers expressed concern that lack of uniform government guidance on implementation of February 2006 changes to visa laws affected the ability of missionaries to live and work in the country. Authorities frequently questioned foreign missionaries and humanitarian workers and the local citizens who worked with them about the sources and use of their funding. There were also credible reports that these foreign workers were followed and surveilled by security personnel.

According to Forum 18, in September 2006 authorities refused Israeli citizen Rabbi Boruch Lamdan permission to conduct religious activity due to his alleged "illegal commercial activity," although he was allowed to remain in the country. Rabbi Lamdan denied the allegations, stating that the refusal stemmed from his late tax payments on charitable donations that were sent to him personally. Lamdan departed the country in June 2007 after the Government did not renew his religious visa.

In July 2006 authorities denied permission for the unregistered Full Gospel Union to invite Nigerian pastor Anselm Madubuko to preach at three New Generation member churches. The authorities claimed that the group had "no basis" to invite him since it is unregistered and noted that they considered Madubuko's visit "inexpedient" given the New Generation's alleged "violation of Belarusian law."

The Government does not permit foreign missionaries to engage in religious activity outside of their host institutions. Transferring between religious organizations, including parishes, requires prior state permission. For example, on October 13, 2006, authorities fined Polish citizen and Catholic priest Antoni Koczko $29 (62,000 rubles) for conducting an "unauthorized" religious service in Minsk, since he had been assigned to a church in Slutsk.

Internal affairs agencies may compel the departure of foreign clergy by denying registrations and stay permits. Authorities may act independently or based on recommendations from other government entities.

In spring 2007 the founder/pastor of the Minsk-based New Testament Church and pastor of its Messianic Jewish congregation, an American citizen who had worked in the country for 10 years, was forced to leave the country. Authorities had refused to renew his work permit in spring 2006. In October 2006 authorities refused to renew visas for 12 Polish Catholic nuns and priests from the Grodno region who had been working in the country for more than 10 years, citing the need to provide local graduates of the Catholic seminaries with jobs. Despite hunger strikes, petitions, and protests by the Catholic community, the priests and nuns were told to leave the country by December 31, 2006.

Legislation prohibits "subversive activities" by foreign organizations and the establishment of offices by foreign organizations whose activities incite "national, religious, and racial enmity" or could "have negative effects on the physical and mental health of the people." On May 30, 2007, authorities fined Polish citizen Yaroslav Lukasik, an unofficial pastor of the John the Baptist Church, $15 (31,000 rubles) for conducting unauthorized religious services at a fellow pastor's home on May 27. At the same time, they issued him deportation papers for "repeated violations of the regime governing the presence of foreigners," ordered him to leave the country by June 7, and barred him from reentry for 5 years. Lukasik denied the charges, stating that he had attended, not conducted, religious services on May 27. On May 8, 2007, authorities canceled Lukasik's residency permit due to his alleged involvement in "activities aimed at causing damage to the national security." Lukasik appealed the fine and the deportation order to the local court, but the court denied the appeals on June 20 and June 27, respectively. Lukasik is married to a local citizen and has three local citizen children. Independent media reported that his family also appealed to a higher court in Minsk; however, authorities alleged that the papers related to the case were "lost" and could not be found before the statute of limitations for the appeal expired.

Foreign citizens officially in the country for nonreligious work can be reprimanded or expelled if they participate in religious activities.

On June 21, 2007, a Mogilyov judge overturned penalties involving seven U.S. citizens due to technical errors and sent the case back for a retrial. On February 16, 2007, the Government had deported the seven and banned them from the country for 2 years for two separate counts of illegal teaching and illegal religious activities. On February 13, the police charged the group with violating article 185 of the administrative code, "Violation of Rules of Foreign Citizens' Stay in Belarus" and fined them $15 (32,000 rubles) each for engaging in activities incompatible with the terms of their visas; according to the Government, the seven failed to obtain prior permission from the Education Ministry before they began teaching English at a house of worship in Mogilyov. The charges stemmed from a February 9 police raid on a church building; the results of the retrial were pending at the end of the reporting period.

On March 14, 2007, authorities canceled the residency permit of a U.S. Protestant humanitarian aid worker and deported him. Authorities claimed he was involved in activities "aimed at causing damage to national security" without explaining the alleged threat. The man had served as a charity worker and attended a Protestant church in Minsk.

Baptist Union representative Gennadiy Brutskiy reported that authorities questioned a U.S. citizen who held a humanitarian work visa after he addressed a Bible college graduation ceremony in May 2006. In March 2007 authorities refused to renew the man's visa, forcing him to leave the country.

By law, citizens are not prohibited from proselytizing and may speak freely about their religious beliefs; however, in practice authorities often interfered with or punished some individuals who proselytized on behalf of registered or unregistered religious groups. Authorities regulated every aspect of proselytizing and literature distribution.

The Government continued to harass and fine Hare Krishnas for illegally distributing religious literature. In January 2007 authorities confiscated 14 books from a Hare Krishna and fined the person $15 (32,000 rubles) for illegally distributing religious material.

On June 12, 2007, police removed a sign that read "I have the right to faith" from a bridge in downtown Minsk within 90 minutes of its placement there by opposition activists.

The Government continued to use textbooks that promoted religious intolerance, especially toward "nontraditional" faiths. Leaders of Protestant communities criticized language in the textbook Basics of Home and Personal Security as discriminatory against Protestants, particularly the chapter entitled "Beware of Sects." The chapter includes a paragraph informing students of such "sects" as Seventh-day Adventists, the Church of Maria, White Brotherhood, and Jehovah's Witnesses. The Ministry of Education continued to use the textbook Man, Society, and State, which labels Protestants and Hare Krishnas as "sects," even after protests by religious groups. The authorities promised to change the language in the next edition of the books; neither book was republished by the end of the period covered by this report.

During the reporting period, the Government took steps to "warn" the public of "new" groups and discouraged their growth. On June 15, 2007, the state newspaper Respublika published an article titled "New Crusaders" which compared contemporary Catholic missionary activities to the Crusades and characterized the involvement of Pope John Paul II in the fall of communism as a "devilish enterprise," alleging collaboration with the CIA. The Polish community in the country denounced the article and called for criminal charges against its author and the newspaper's editor. Respublika later issued an apology. On December 12, 2006, Respublika urged government authorities to treat "new" religions with extreme caution because they might lead to tragedy and pose threats to society. The author alleged that new religions, including Scientology, Kabbalah, and Buddhism, are syncretic and do not teach their followers "anything good."

On May 21, 2007, God's Grace Head Pastor Sergey Khomich received a letter from the state-controlled Lad television channel denying any wrongdoing in a May 12 broadcast in which a television host referred to the God's Grace community as a "totalitarian and destructive sect." While broadcasting footage of a God's Grace prayer service and a conference, host Artyom Makhakeyev accused healers of swindling money out of sick people and warned that the wealthy "frequently become the focus of sects' attention."

On December 8, 2006, the Government informed the New Life Church that it would not initiate a case against state-controlled Capital TV (STV). On October 14 and 15, 2006, STV made slanderous allegations against the unregistered Protestant group in a report entitled "Strange Worshippers of a No Less Strange Religion." When STV would not retract its allegations, the New Life Church asked the authorities to open a criminal case against STV and to refute the station's allegations. The Government refused on the grounds that "there was no sign of any crime in their actions."

Despite the BOC's favored status, the Government also warned about the "excessive influence" of the BOC. President Lukashenko met with senior BOC bishops on December 21, 2006, to explain his "pragmatic" approach to the BOC after it complained about an article in a state newspaper by a presidential administration official that warned citizens against the BOC's influence and claimed that it weakens the impact of state ideology.

There were credible reports of government interference with religious travel. The Belarus-based Christian Human Rights House reported that on January 3, 2007, authorities stopped and searched a bus carrying approximately 40 young Catholics and Protestants at the Belarus-Poland border for approximately 5 hours. The group was returning to Belarus after a pilgrimage to Croatia.

On August 9, 2006, border guards took into custody and transported to Minsk 47 Baptist children and adults who were on a religious retreat at a private homestead in the western Grodno region for alleged violations of health and safety regulations. The previous day, local authorities had ordered the gathering to disperse and threatened to take the children to a police facility for juvenile delinquents and abandoned children. After their release, a senior Minsk religious affairs official publicly conceded that the retreat was legal since private individuals had organized the event. According to Forum 18, different government departments conducted up to four daily checks on a Baptist summer youth camp in the Brest region.

Limited restitution of religious property occurred during the reporting period. There is no legal basis for restitution of property seized during the Soviet and Nazi occupations, and the law restricts the restitution of property being used for cultural or educational purposes. The Government did not return buildings if it had nowhere to move the current occupants. For example, most of the Jewish community's past requests for the return of Minsk synagogues, which were in use as theaters, museums, sports complexes, and a beer hall, were refused. However, during the reporting period Jewish communities did not request the return of buildings or other real estate.

On November 28, 2006, local authorities in Volozhyn threatened to rescind the Jewish community's rights to possess a restituted yeshiva building due to lack of renovation work. The Jewish community had started renovations on the yeshiva, which had been returned to the community in the 1990s, but ran out of funds before completing them. The authorities ultimately did not confiscate the 200-year-old building after a U.S.-based committee pledged in May 2007 to raise funds to finance the renovation.

At the end of the reporting period, the St. Joseph Catholic community in Minsk continued a campaign for the Government to return former Bernardine church and monastery buildings, home to the state archives and slated to be converted into a hotel and entertainment center. The community has held regular prayer services at the site since first learning of reconstruction plans in 2004, but in March 2007 the Government announced new conversion plans, after which the community launched the petition drive. As of June 4, 2007, the petition had more than 10,000 signatures. Previously, the OPRRNA chairman said that since the Government did not have funds to construct new archive buildings, the church and monastery could not be handed back. On June 7, authorities prevented the community from gathering to pray, stating that they needed permission to assemble, but did not detain any worshippers. On June 16, approximately 90 persons gathered outside the church and lit candles while police watched.

===Abuses of religious freedom===
The Government continued to abuse the religious freedom of several religious groups. As in the past, the most common charge against religious leaders was organizing or hosting an unauthorized meeting, a charge that arises from a law circumscribing [[freedom of assembly]].

The law allows persons to gather to pray in private homes; however, it imposes restrictions on holding rituals, rites, or ceremonies in such locations and requires prior permission from local authorities. During the reporting period, Protestant and non-BOC Orthodox communities were fined or warned for illegally conducting religious services, carrying out unsanctioned religious activities, or illegally gathering without prior government permission.

On June 26, 2007, the Minsk Central District Court rejected a complaint by Antony Bokun, pastor of the registered John the Baptist Church, that police mistreated him following his arrest earlier in the month. On June 4, 2007, a Minsk District Court Judge sentenced Bokun to 3 days in prison for organizing an unauthorized religious service in his home on June 3. On that day, 10 officials raided Bokun's home during church services and took him and Polish Protestant pastor Yaroslav Lukasik to a police station. The police released Lukasik after a few hours but held Bokun overnight despite his cardiovascular condition. He became ill and needed medical attention. On June 27 and June 20, 2007, respectively, the Minsk City Court dismissed Bokun's appeals of a jail sentence and fine stemming from a separate incident. On May 28, the court had found Bokun guilty of conducting an illegal religious service and fined him $290 (620,000 rubles). Police officers had arrested Bokun on May 27 after entering his house and videotaping the service.

On May 8, 2007, police detained and warned youth activist Ivan Shutko that his participation in the campaign to prevent the Roman Catholic monastery in Minsk from being transformed into a hotel and casino might result in "great problems."

On April 11, 2007, authorities issued an official warning to Sergey Nesterovich of the unregistered God's Transfiguration Brotherhood for regularly conducting illegal religious meetings in his apartment and collecting funds. In March 2007 KGB secret police had conducted a 3-hour raid of Nesterovich's apartment during a prayer meeting. The police searched the apartment, confiscated written materials, and questioned and photographed the attendees. Nesterovich appealed the warning, but authorities denied the appeal.

In December 2006 authorities issued Pastor Nikolay Borichevskiy of the Grace of Jesus Church in Krupki village a written warning for violating residence permit regulations; he ignored the warning and remained in Krupki. When Borichevskiy asked what had brought on the charge, the officials responded that his repeated criticism of the regime drew their attention.

On August 30, 2006, Union of Evangelical Christians Salvation Church (UECSC) pastor Sergey Poznyakovich was fined $2,170 (4.65 million rubles) for performing a baptism ceremony in a nearby lake. In July 2006 UECSC Bishop Nikolay Kurkayev was fined $75 (160,000 rubles) for holding an unauthorized religious service. On July 28, 2006, authorities fined New Life Church Pastor Vyacheslav Goncharenko $470 (1 million rubles) for having conducted an unsanctioned religious service earlier that month. During the previous reporting period, there were at least 13 reported instances of the Government imposing fines ranging from $13 to $2,600 (26,000 to 5.3 million rubles) for illegal religious activity.

There were no reports of forced religious conversion.

===Anti-Semitism===
The number of individual anti-Semitic incidents increased during the reporting period. Anti-Semitism is tolerated by the state. Anti-Semitic acts were only sporadically investigated, and the Government allowed state enterprises to freely print and distribute anti-Semitic material.

Unlike in previous reporting periods, state-owned periodicals did not attack Jewish religious groups; however, the sale and distribution of anti-Semitic literature through state press distributors, government agencies, and stores affiliated with the BOC continued. During the reporting period, anti-Semitic and Russian ultranationalist newspapers and literature, DVDs, and videocassettes continued to be sold at Pravoslavnaya Kniga (Orthodox Bookstore), which sells Orthodox literature and religious paraphernalia. The store was part of the Khristianskaya Initsiativa company, whose general director often wrote xenophobic articles. The store continued to distribute the anti-Semitic and xenophobic newspaper Russkiy Vestnik despite a 2003 order by the Prosecutor General and the Ministry of Information to remove copies from the store. The official BOC website honors Gavril Belostokskiy, a young child allegedly murdered by Jews near Grodno in 1690, as one of its saints and martyrs. A memorial prayer to be said on the anniversary of his death alleges the "martyred and courageous" Gavril "exposed Jewish dishonesty." The book Demons on the Russian Land: Globalism as a Product of Evil, by Belarusian National Academy of Sciences (BNAS) researcher Valeriy Zelenevskiy, was also available at Pravoslavnaya Kniga. Published in Minsk at the end of 2006, the book contains numerous anti-Semitic statements, such as "the Jews still adhere to pro-slavery views." Since the state-run BNAS approved publishing of the book, Jewish leaders and human rights activists considered the book to be a reflection of certain segments of the regime's ideology.

Several Jewish religious sites were vandalized during the reporting period.

On June 28, 2007, local Jewish leaders reported that four gravestones in a Jewish cemetery were knocked down by vandals in Mogilyov earlier in the week. Relatives of those buried in the graves appealed to the police, one of whom theorized that the heavy tombstones may have been knocked down by a wind storm, despite the fact that there were no strong storms around the time of the incident.

On May 9, 2007, vandals set fire to flowers laid at the monument to the victims of the Brest Jewish ghetto. Police opened a criminal case but did not identify any suspects. This was the eighth act of vandalism at the monument since it was erected in 1992 and the third during this reporting period. In February 2007 vandals desecrated the monument, but no suspects were identified. On November 29, 2006, an explosion occurred at the same monument. The blast caused minor damage to the memorial. The Jewish community protested the local authorities' refusal to open a criminal investigation into the November incident, which police described as petty hooliganism. According to a local Jewish community leader, police were still investigating the February incident at the end of the reporting period.

On May 4, 2007, vandals drew a picture of a Star of David hanging from a gallows on the foundation of a bridge in Brest. The graffiti was removed not long after it appeared and the local Jewish community did not file a report with the police.

On March 1, 2007, independent media reported that vandals removed part of a metal plaque attached to a monument built on the site of an old Jewish cemetery in remembrance of the killing of the Minsk ghetto Bremen Jews. Also in early March 2007, a bronze memorial plaque on a residential building in central Minsk placed in remembrance of the killing of the Bremen Jews disappeared. An unidentified man claimed to have found the plaque and returned it to the Jewish community following announcements that the German ambassador would pay a $1,350 (2.9 million rubles) reward for the plaque's return. At the end of February 2007, vandals damaged the Star of David on a memorial plaque in Kurapaty honoring Jewish victims of Stalinism.

On May 3, 2007, police in Borisov opened a criminal case in connection with vandalism at the Jewish cemetery. Vandals had removed and damaged 16 tombstones at the end of April. The case remained open at the end of the reporting period; no suspects were identified.

In late February 2007, neo-Nazi activists attacked Larissa Shukailo, the head of the Mogilyov branch of the Belarusian Association for Victims of Political Repression. Two young persons threw a bottle at Shukailo, shouting "Get away to your Israel!" Shukailo filed a complaint with the authorities, but no suspects were identified by the end of the reporting period.

On November 12, 2006, vandals desecrated the Yama Holocaust memorial in central Minsk with white paint and swastikas. Despite a number of neo-Nazi anti-Semitic leaflets signed by the "Belaya Rus Aryan Resistance Front" found at the site, authorities dismissed the incident as a case of teenage hooliganism. The same day swastikas and "Beat the Jews!" graffiti were painted on the Israeli Information and Cultural Center. State-controlled STV's coverage of the vandal attacks referred to Jewish culture as "alien to Belarus." Despite government officials' promises to prosecute offenders, on March 16, 2007, police closed the criminal cases, citing lack of suspects.

In early October 2006, unidentified vandals damaged a concrete fence surrounding a Jewish cemetery and destroyed 10 tombstones in the northern city of Orsha; 17 gravestones were vandalized at a Christian cemetery. Police refused to open criminal cases, calling the acts minor civil offenses.

In September 2006 vandals damaged five graves in an old Jewish cemetery in the eastern village of Sverzhan. Police opened an investigation, but no suspects were identified by the end of the reporting period.

The Jewish community continued to express concern over the concept of a "greater Slavic union" popular among nationalist organizations active in the country, including the Russian National Union (RNU), which still existed despite being officially dissolved in 2000. Throughout the reporting period, Jewish leaders petitioned the authorities to investigate neo-Nazi activities, citing continued vandalism, anti-Semitic graffiti, and threats to civil society and religious congregations. Authorities responded with empathetic letters but did not open any criminal cases in connection with these complaints.

On August 10, 2006, independent newspaper Vitebskiy Kuryer received a letter from the neo-Nazi group RNU threatening to close the newspaper if it continued publishing articles discrediting the Belarusian president and his policies aimed at making "Slavonic nations superior in comparison with Jews." The letterhead contained the slogan "To clean Russia!" and a picture of a soldier holding a strangled man with the Star of David painted on his breast and U.S. dollars in his pocket. Law enforcement agencies did not investigate the threat, maintaining that since the RNU was not registered in the region, it was impossible to track down the letter's authors.

===Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom===
There have been some positive developments in respect for religious freedom.

Authorities granted the St. John the Baptist Catholic Community permission to build a church in Minsk and gave the community a plot of land for the building. Construction began on June 15, 2007. This was the first Catholic church to be built in Minsk since the 1917 Revolution.

In 2007 authorities returned a building in Grodno to the St. Pokrovskiy Orthodox Cathedral.

In August 2006 civil society activists in Orsha managed to save the remains of an 18th-century church. The activists sent letters and petitions to local government officials protesting the construction of a detention center on the site. In early August construction was suspended, and on August 31 officials agreed to alter the project in an effort to prevent the construction from damaging the church's foundation.

On July 20, 2006, the Prosecutor's Office repealed a warning to preschool teacher Lyudmila Izakson-Bolotovskaya for the "illegal and deliberate dissemination of religious dogma to young children" following her appeal. In April 2006 authorities had issued an official warning to Izakson-Bolotovskaya after she and her children's Jewish musical group were shown on local television celebrating a Jewish holiday at a state-run kindergarten. Authorities had claimed that she violated the law by holding a religious celebration in a government building and illegally propagated Judaism. Izakson-Bolotovskaya maintained that this was a cultural event for nonreligious educational purposes. The authorities forced Izakson-Bolotovskaya to remove "Jewish symbols" from the classroom and threatened her with future prosecution if she continued such activities. The group reconvened in September 2006 to continue studying Jewish history and traditions.

On July 5, 2006, President Lukashenko issued a directive to return the Holy Trinity Church (St. Roch Church) in Minsk and property inside to the Roman Catholic Church. For the previous 15 years, the church was used as the music hall for the Belarusian State Philharmonic Society.

Several religious memorials were unveiled during the reporting period. Although most were privately funded, local government officials participated in most dedication ceremonies.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
While some members of society tried to promote religious freedom, [[societal abuses]] and [[discrimination]] based on religious beliefs occurred, and anti-Semitism and negative attitudes toward minority religious groups persisted.

As in previous years, unknown vandals destroyed crosses, both Orthodox and non-Orthodox, erected at Kurapaty, an area used by the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs to murder more than 300,000 people in the 1930s. In April 2007 vandals attacked the Stalin-era massacre memorial site at Kurapaty, knocking over and breaking six crosses. No criminal investigation took place by the end of the reporting period.

On May 30, 2007, unidentified burglars broke into the St. George Church in Vardomichy, stealing five icons. This was the latest in a string of unsolved church burglaries that resulted in the theft of 16 icons from 3 different churches in 2007. Police did not report any breakthroughs in their investigations of these crimes, which they attributed to a ring of experienced criminals.

There were several incidents of arson during the reporting period. On March 27, 2007, vandals set fire to the Roman Catholic St. Michael Church in Mozyr and drew satanic graffiti on the exterior walls. Ten days earlier, vandals broke a sculpture, crosses, and a window at the church. On March 28, police arrested four members of the satanic group Bloody Moon; the suspects remained in jail, and the investigation was ongoing at the end of the reporting period.

On December 25, 2006, vandals set fire to the Orthodox St. George Church in Mozyr, completely destroying its roof and interior walls. The remaining external walls were covered with graffiti. This was the second time the church had been set on fire in 6 weeks; on November 13, vandals drew satanic symbols on the outside of the church and set it on fire. The four members of the Bloody Moon satanic group who were detained for vandalizing the St. Michael Church in Mozyr pleaded guilty to setting fire to the St. George Church. They remained in police custody and the investigation was ongoing at the end of the reporting period.

On July 13, 2006, there was a suspicious fire at the Roman Catholic St. Francis Xavier (Farny) Church in Grodno. The fire destroyed part of the main altar and four 18th-century sculptures. Police opened a criminal case, but no further information was available at the end of the reporting period.

Several cemeteries and burial grounds were attacked or damaged during the reporting period. On April 27, 2007, police charged a man with damaging historical property after five 10th- and 11th-century burial mounds were vandalized in Zaslavl on March 10 and 16, 2007. No further information was available by the end of the reporting period.

On February 13, 2007, police suspended a criminal investigation into a January 15, 2007, attack on a Muslim cemetery in Slonim that contains the graves of Russian Muslim soldiers killed in World War I due to failure to find suspects. Vandals overturned six gravestones, destroying two. This was the third attack on the cemetery since 1996.

Independent media reported that on November 20, 2006, unidentified vandals painted "Don't Believe Sects!" on a billboard in Baranovichi that directed persons to the Salvation Church, an affiliate of the Union of Evangelical Faith Christians in the Republic of Belarus. Officials and media opined that drunken teenagers might have been the vandals. The church claimed that this was an organized action.

On November 17, 2006, the New Life Church reported that police refused to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the defacing of their church on the night of October 31, 2006. Alleged members of the National Bolshevik Party, a Russian extremist group, splashed black paint on the church and painted in red "No to Totalitarian Sects!" and the party's symbol.

During the reporting period, there were some positive actions undertaken by private actors to promote greater respect and tolerance among different religions and to promote religious freedom.

On June 18, 2007, the General Secretaries of Catholic Bishops' Conferences of Europe concluded a 4-day forum held in Minsk. It was the first time in the contemporary history of the country that the secretaries gathered in Minsk. They discussed migration, ecumenism, pastoral care, relations with Muslim communities, and the issues facing the Roman Catholic communities in the country, including difficulties with building new churches. On June 15, the secretaries had a successful meeting with BOC Head Metropolitan Philaret.

On May 28, 2007, BOC Head Metropolitan Philaret expressed support for the public organizing committee for the commemoration of the victims of Stalinist repressions.

In February 2007 Roma and Baptist communities worked together to provide the Roma population with gospels in Romany at no charge.

On April 19, 2007, the NGO Christian Human Rights House, in cooperation with the BCD, released "Monitoring of the Violations of Christians' Rights in Belarus," which chronicled repression against Christians during 2006. Christian Human Rights House was created in the summer of 2006 to monitor religious freedom violations and to work to alleviate the repression of freedom of conscience in the country.

On June 17, 2007, more than 500 Protestant communities across the country gathered at churches to conduct prayer services calling for changes in the religion law that they see as discriminatory against Protestant congregations. On April 22, Christian communities, including Protestants and Catholics, some individual Orthodox priests, and the BCD launched a campaign to collect 50,000 signatures on a petition calling for the revocation of the 2002 law on religions and religious organizations. On May 8, the Belarusian Exarchate of the ROC urged believers not to sign the petition, claiming that the law helps maintain peace among religious communities and stability in the country. By the end of the reporting period, the campaign reported collecting thousands of signatures.

On June 4, 2007, independent news services reported that approximately 5,000 Protestants gathered at the Church of Grace in Minsk to pray for persecuted religious activists and for freedom of religion, including the right to pray in private homes. The crowd adopted an appeal to President Lukashenko requesting a review of the 2002 religion law and an end to the arrests of ministers.

'''Freedom of religion in Colombia''' is enforced by the State and well tolerated in the Colombian culture. The Republic of [[Colombia]] has an area of 439,735 square miles (1,138,908 square kilometers) and its population is estimated at 46 million. Although the Government does not keep official statistics on religious affiliation, a 2001 poll commissioned by the country's leading newspaper, [http://eltiempo.com El Tiempo], indicated that the religious demography is as follows:

*81% [[Roman Catholic]] Christians. 
*10% Non-evangelical Protestant [[Christian]]s
*3.5% Evangelical Protestant Christians
*1.9% No religious beliefs
*3.6% Other faiths:
**[[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]: about 180,000 members
**[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]: about 130,000 members
**[[Jehovah's Witnesses]]: about 120,000 members.
**[[Judaism]]: between 5,000 and 10,000 members.
**[[Islam]]: figures unknown, probably below 2,000.
*60% reported not practising their faith actively.

== Other religious statistics ==

The [[National Administrative Department of Statistics]] (DANE) does not collect religious statistics, and accurate reports are difficult to obtain. However, based on various studies and a survey, about 90% of the population adheres to [[Christianity]], the majority of which (70.9%) are [[Roman Catholic]], while a significant minority (16.7%) adhere to [[Protestantism]] (primarily [[Evangelicalism]]). Some 4.7% of the population is [[atheist]] or [[agnostic]], while 3.5% claim to believe in God but do not follow a specific religion. 1.8% of Colombians adhere to [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Adventism]] and less than 1% adhere to other religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Hinduism]], [[animism|Indigenous religions]], [[Hare Krishna movement]], [[Rastafari movement]], [[Orthodox Catholic Church]], and spiritual studies. The remaining people either did not respond or replied that they did not know. In addition to the above statistics, 35.9% of Colombians reported that they did not practice their faith actively. &lt;ref name="Religion"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bdigital.unal.edu.co/10780/1/Del%20monopolio%20cat%C3%B3lico%20a%20la%20explosi%C3%B3n%20pentecostal.pdf|title=  Del monopolio católico a la explosión pentecostal’|author = Beltrán Cely, William Mauricio|publisher = Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Facultad de Ciencias Humanas, Centro de Estudios Sociales (CES), Maestría en Sociología|language = Spanish|ISBN = 978-958-761-465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bdigital.unal.edu.co/8486/1/williammauriciobeltran.2011.pdf|title= Descripción cuantitativa de la pluralización religiosa en Colombia |author = Beltrán Cely, William Mauricio | authorlink = William Mauricio Beltrán Cely |publisher = Universitas humanística 73 (2012): 201–238. – bdigital.unal.edu.co}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion in Latin America"&gt;{{cite web|title= Religion in Latin America,  Widespread Change in a Historically Catholic Region|url= http://www.pewforum.org/2014/11/13/religion-in-latin-america/#|website= pewforum.org|publisher= Pew Research Center|date = November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Colombia remains a mostly Roman Catholic country by [[baptism]] numbers, the 1991 Colombian constitution guarantees freedom and equality of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title II – Concerning rights, guarantees, and duties – Chapter I – Concerning fundamental rights – Article 19)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colombian Constitution of 1991 abolished the previous condition of the Roman Catholic Church as state church, and it includes two articles providing for freedom of worship:

*Art. 13: States that "all people are legally born free and equal" and that they will not be discriminated on the basis of "gender, race, national or familial origin, language, ''religion'', political or philosophical opinion".
*Art. 19: Which expressly guarantees freedom of religion.  "Freedom of religion is guaranteed. Every individual has the right to freely profess his/her religion and to disseminate it individually or collectively. All religious faiths and churches are equally free before the law."

Currently, there seem to be no social controversy or problem arising from religious conflict.   Almost all cities and towns in Colombia have a church, but there are also [[temple]]s, [[mosque]]s and [[synagogue]]s, especially in the largest cities.

In the 1980s, religious attaches in the Kingdom's ~70 embassies around the world worked to "get new mosques built in their countries and to persuade existing mosques to propagate the ''dawah wahhabiya''".

The Saudi Arabian government funds a number of international organizations to spread fundamentalist Islam, including the [[Muslim World League]], the [[World Assembly of Muslim Youth]], the [[International Islamic Relief Organization]], and various royal charities.{{#tag:ref|led by Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz, minister of defense at the time who became king in January 2015|group=Note}}  Supporting  proselytizing or preaching of Islam  (''[[Dawah|da'wah]]''), has been called "a religious requirement" for Saudi rulers that cannot be abandoned "without losing their domestic legitimacy" as protectors and propagators of Islam.&lt;ref name=house-groups&gt;{{cite book

Supporting da'wah, which literally means `making an invitation` to Islam, is a religious requirement that Saudi rulers feel they cannot abandon without losing their domestic legitimacy as protectors and propagators of Islam. Yet in the wake of 9/11, American anger at the kingdom led the U.S. government to demand controls on Saudi largesse to Islamic groups that funded terrorism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of  journalist [[Scott Shane]], "when Saudi imams arrived in Muslim countries in Asia or Africa, or in Muslim communities in Europe or the Americas, wearing traditional Arabian robes, speaking the language of the Quran — and carrying a generous checkbook — they had automatic credibility."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-islam.html|title=Saudis and Extremism: ‘Both the Arsonists and the Firefighters’|last=Shane|first=Scott|date=2016-08-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the [[Wahhabi movement|Wahhabi]] interpretation of Islam, other strict and conservative interpretations of Sunni Islam directly or indirectly assisted by funds from Saudi Arabia and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] include those of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] [[Islamist]] organizations.

Critics argue that volunteers mobilized to fight in Afghanistan (such as [[Osama bin Laden]]) and "exultant" at their success against the Soviet superpower, went on to fight Jihad against Muslim governments and civilians in other countries.  And that conservative Sunni groups such as the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan and [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Pakistan]] are attacking and killing not only non-Muslims but fellow Muslims they consider to be [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates]], such as [[Shia]] and [[Sufi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

According to Hind Fraihi, a Moroccan-Belgian journalist, Saudi-trained imams and literature from Saudi Arabia glorifying jihad and advocating Islam  versus non-Muslims thinking was “part of the cocktail” (other factors being "economic frustration, racism, a generation that feels it has no future”) leading to the [[Brussels ISIL terror cell|ISIL terror cell]] in Belgium committing  terrorist acts in Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016.

Eight universities, "including [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]", accepted "more than £233.5 million from Saudi and Muslim sources" from 1995 to 2008, "with much of the money going to [[Islamic studies|Islamic study centres]]".&lt;ref name=donations-teleg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1584954/Extremism-fear-over-Islam-studies-donations.html  |title='Extremism' fear over Islam studies donations |date =13 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 article in [[Arab News]] reported&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia has been the largest source of donations from Islamic states and royal families to British universities, much of which is devoted to the study of Islam, the Middle East and Arabic literature.
A large share of this money went toward establishing Islamic study centers. In 2008, Prince [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]] donated £8 million (SR 48.5 million) each to [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] for this purpose, ''[[Al Eqtisadiah]]'' business daily reported yesterday.
[[Oxford University|Oxford]] has been the largest British beneficiary of Saudi support. In 2005, Prince Sultan, the late crown prince, gave £2 million (SR 12 million) to the [[Ashmolean Museum]]. In 2001, the King Abdul Aziz Foundation gave £1 million (SR 6.1 million) to the Middle East Center.
There are many other donors. Oxford’s £75 million (SR 454.6 million) Islamic Studies Center was supported by 12 Muslim countries. Ruler of [[Oman]], Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said al Said]], gave £3.1 million (SR 18.8 million) to Cambridge to fund two posts, including a chair of Arabic.
Ruler of [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] [in the [[UAE]]], Sheikh [[Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi]], has supported [[University of Exeter|Exeter]]’s Islamic studies center with more than £5 million (SR 30 million) since 2001. Trinity Saint David, part of the [[University of Wales]], has received donations from the ruler of [[Abu Dhabi]] Sheikh [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]].&lt;ref name="BURSF-2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=British universities receive Saudi funds|url=http://www.arabnews.com/british-universities-receive-saudi-funds|accessdate=23 July 2017|agency=ARAB NEWS|date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 2017, following the [[June 2017 London Bridge attack|London Bridge terror attack]], opposition leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] stated that the "difficult conversations" Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] called for should start with "Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states that have funded and fuelled extremist ideology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-saudi-arabia-extremist-funding-terrorism-gulf-states-qatar-isis-al-qaeda-labour-a7773451.html  |title=Jeremy Corbyn calls for 'difficult conversations' with Saudi Arabia and Gulf states over extremism funding |date =5 June 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A July 2017 report by the [[Henry Jackson Society]], commissioned by the government of the UK, stated that Middle Eastern nations are providing financial support to mosques and Islamic educational institutions, which have been linked to the spread of extremist material with "an illiberal, bigoted Wahhabi ideology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40496778 |title=Saudi Arabia has 'clear link' to UK extremism, report says |date=5 July 2017|work=BBC|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/03/theresa-may-report-foreign-funding-extremists-saudi-arabia  |title=Theresa May sitting on report on foreign funding of UK extremists |author=Elgot, Jessica|date=4 July 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report said that the number of Salafi and Wahhabi mosques in Britain had increased from 68 in 2007 to 110 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://themarketmogul.com/extremism-report-puts-saudi-arabia-and-british-pm-may-on-the-spot-strengthens-qatar-in-gulf-crisis/  |title=Saudi Arabian Extremism in the UK: Inside the Henry Jackson Report |author=Dorsey, James M|date=6 July 2017|work=The Market Mogal|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern Europe/Balkans==
Historically parts of the [[Balkans]] were introduced to Islam while under the domination of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and have majority or large minority Muslim populations. The [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Communism]] and [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], provided an opportunity for international Islamic charities to Islamization (or re-Islamization) people who had been living under an irreligious Communist government. Islamic charities—often with the backing of oil-rich Gulf kingdoms—built mosques and madrassas in [[Albania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journalpioneer.com/opinion/columnists/2016/8/21/two-albanian-majority-countries-fear-gro-4620907.html|title=Two Albanian-majority countries fear growth of Islamism|date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and other Balkan countries.

===Albania===

A Muslim majority country, Albania had been under anti-clerical communist control for 45 years when the [[Eastern bloc]] fell in 1991. The pro-Islamic [[Democratic Party of Albania|Democratic Party]] was elected to power in 1992, and the government of [[Sali Berisha]] "turned to Saudi Arabia for financial support," and for assistance in "re-Islamizing" the country. Thirty [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and Islamic associations worked toward re-Islamization of Albania, including thirteen of the organizations formed a `Coordination Council of Arab Foundations.` Saudi Arabia sponsored `Al Haramein` and `Musafaq` (which were based in Britain) foundations which "vied" with Islamic organizations from Libya, Sudan, Iran and Turkey in "instumentalization of humanitarian aid as a means of proselytization." At least the Saudi and Sunni Islamist groups preached for creation of an Islamic society "based principally on Wahhabism." Saudi NGOs built 200 mosques and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia donated one million copies of an Albanian language version of the Quran.&lt;ref name=CWDI/&gt;

According to  Olivier Roy and Antoine Sfeir, the "organized project undertaken by preachers and Islamic NGOs" was to "expunge indigenous Albanian ideas about Islam, before replacing it with a version of the faith more in conformity with the Wahhabi model. ... Islam in its most radical form was taught as the only true faith, while tolerance was seen as an indication of weakness. ... Hatred of the West was raised to the status of a creed."&lt;ref name=CWDI/&gt;

One of the first Islamists to come to Albania was Muhammad al Zawahiri, (the brother of [[Ayman al Zawahiri]], the leader of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] movement and [[Osama Bin Laden]]'s key lieutenant) as an accountant for the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO). (Unbeknownst to Albanians, in addition to helping with relief and spreading correct Islam, IIRO was charged with the task of helping other members of Islamic Jihad find jobs within "charitable organizations building mosques, orphanages and clinics."  By the mid-1980s, the Tirana cell of Islamic Jihad numbered 16 members, including a specialist in false identity documents, a recruit wanted on suspicion of involvement in the attempted assassination.  This was later exposed during an investigation carried out by the American and Albanian secret services,&lt;ref name=CWDI&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sfeir|editor1-first=Antoine|title=The Columbia World Dictionary of Islamism|date=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press.|pages=28–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNrMilgHKKEC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=albania+iiro&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Sr_RKq10Jh&amp;sig=oXyMPACaMKslyGTFC4M_9PyPuUM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Oj8tVd_gMMeZoQT07oCQCQ&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=albania%20iiro&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FTCS&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Freeman|editor1-first=Michael|title=Financing Terrorism: Case Studies|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lQFhQpE0ye4C&amp;pg=PT248&amp;lpg=PT248&amp;dq=albania+iiro&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0XEJx0pkc4&amp;sig=vJphjepF44ZUtEsyVC9kr8rbp_Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Xz8tVc6FFYn1oAT7-4DgCA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=albania%20iiro&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1998 three Egyptian Islamist accused of terrorist activities were arrested in Albania, with further arrests in September after the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]]. )

How successful the proselytizing has been is unclear. Roy and Sfeir believe that with NGO work in the 1990s "Islamists gained an important foothold",&lt;ref name=CWDI/&gt; however, a 2012 Pew Research study found that only 15% of Muslims surveyed considered religion "a very important factor" in their lives—the lowest percentage in the world amongst countries with significant Muslim populations.&lt;ref name=pew&gt;{{cite web|title=August 9, 2012 Infographic: The World’s Muslims: Unity and Diversity|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-infographic/|website=pewforum.org|accessdate=14 April 2015|date=9 August 2012|quote=In the 39 countries surveyed, the percentage saying religion is very important to them ranges from 15% in Albania to 98% in Senegal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewforum.org/Muslim/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-infographic.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnia===

During the [[Bosnian War|1992-1995 Bosnian War]], the state of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (where the approximately 43% of the population that was Muslim formed the largest religious group) received aid from Saudi groups — [[International Islamic Relief Organization]], Saudi High Commission for Relief, Muwaffaq Foundations — as well as from non-Saudi Islamic groups. A 1996 report by the CIA stated that "all of the major and most of the minor Islamic charities are significant players in the former Yugoslavia", particularly in aiding Bosnian Muslims, delivering food, clothing, and medicine; supporting orphanages, schools, hospitals, agricultural,  and refugee camps; and constructing housing, infrastructure. According to the Saudi Embassy to the US, the Saudi Joint Committee for Collection of Donations for Bosnia donated $500 million in aid to Muslims for medical care, refugee camps, education during the Bosnian War, and later reconstruction projects for mosques and religious schools.&lt;ref name="Merdjanova-2013-64"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merdjanova|first1=Ina|title=Rediscovering the Umma: Muslims in the Balkans Between Nationalism and ...|date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6eYRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Merdjanova+%22collision+over%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1-e-u--_UAhWj7oMKHQVFAzMQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Merdjanova%20%22collision%20over%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In just one year (1994) Saudi nationals alone gave $150 million through Islamic NGOs for aid to Bosnia. However, a "growing body of reporting indicates that some of these charities are being used to aid Islamic extremist groups that engage in terrorism."&lt;ref name=wikisource-cia&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA Report on NGOs With Terror Links|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/CIA_Report_on_NGOs_With_Terror_Links |website=wikisource.org|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aid to the local Bosnian Islamist party (the [[Party of Democratic Action|SDA]]) gave it leverage to undermined competing local secular and more traditional Muslim groups.&lt;ref name=CWDI-bosnia/&gt; The SDA prohibited consumption of alcohol and pork, "brought Muslim religious instruction  into the schools, opened up prayer rooms, and used the leverage of its distribution of aid to pressurize the population to adopt Muslim names, to wear the veil, and grow beards."&lt;ref name=CWDI-bosnia&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sfeir|editor1-first=Antoine|title=The Columbia World Dictionary of Islamism|date=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press |pages=89–92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNrMilgHKKEC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=bosnia+IIRO&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Sr_RKs1-De&amp;sig=3KoGE_bV7ml9U3YEwPWfpz_9G54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uIwtVYeTE4vsoASSkoHACg&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=bosnia%20IIRO&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FTCS&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Freeman|editor1-first=Michael|title=Financing Terrorism: Case Studies|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lQFhQpE0ye4C&amp;pg=PT248&amp;lpg=PT248&amp;dq=albania+iiro&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0XEJx0pkc4&amp;sig=vJphjepF44ZUtEsyVC9kr8rbp_Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Xz8tVc6FFYn1oAT7-4DgCA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=albania%20iiro&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1992 conference on the protection of human rights in Bosnia brought together representatives from 30 Muslims countries. It passed resolutions declaring "without ambiguity that the aim of the Bosnian conflict was the extermination of Bosnia's Muslims."&lt;ref name=CWDI-bosnia/&gt;

"[[Afghan Arab]]" veterans fighting Serbs in Bosnia as volunteers took upon themselves ''[[Hisbah]]'' ("enjoin good and forbid wrong") including  attempting to impose the veil on women and the beard on men. In addition they engaged in 
&lt;blockquote&gt;causing disturbances in the ceremonies of [Sufi] brotherhoods they deemed to be deviant, ....  smashing up cafes, and ... [organizing] sharia marriages to Bosnian girls that were not declared to the civil authorities.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:251&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
Rather than spreading strict Islamic practice, these activities were so unpopular with the Bosnian public and media they were condemned by the SDA.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:251/&gt;  According to [[Gilles Kepel]], as of 2003, the only thing left of their presence were "a few naturalized Arab subjects married to Bosnian women."&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:251/&gt;

From the end of the Bosnian War to 2007, Saudi-financed organizations  spent about $700 million in Bosnia,  "often in mosques", according to analysts quoted by the New York Times.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/27/world/europe/27islam.html|title=Islamic Revival Tests Bosnia’s Secular Cast|last=Bilefsky|first=Dan|date=2008-12-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "More than half a dozen new madrasas", (religious secondary schools), have been built throughout the country, as have dozens of mosques. In the capital and largest city Sarajevo, Saudi Arabia financed the [[King Fahd Mosque (Sarajevo)|King Fahd Mosque]], a $28 million complex including a sports and cultural center.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  According to a former Bosnian intelligence agent (Goran Kovacevic)  interviewed by a public television network in the US, ([[PBS]]), the mosque is well financed and "the most radical mosque in the whole Bosnia-Herzegovina.  ... All those guys that actually performed some kind of terrorist activity in Bosnia-Herzegovina were part of that mosque".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/is-saudi-funded-mosque-in-sarajevo-threat-to-bosnias-moderate-muslims/ |title=Is Saudi-funded mosque in Sarajevo threat to Bosnia’s moderate Muslims? |work=PBS NewsHour|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2008,  eight people were injured when men in hoods attacked participants at a gay festival in Sarajevo, dragging some people from vehicles and beating others while they chanted, “Kill the gays!” and “Allahu Akbar!”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Wahhabi aid organizations also physically influenced Bosnian religious culture following the war. Saudis have helped restore some of the hundreds of mosques and monuments Serb nationalist forces destroyed during the war. While this assistance was badly needed, it involved removing the Islamic calligraphy that adorned many Balkan Muslim tombstones, which Wahhabis considered idolatrous and unIslamic.  Critics complain that the graveyards were "often all that was left" of the local Bosnian heritage, and Wahhabis took advantage of Bosnian's desperation.&lt;ref name=Finn-bosnia&gt;{{cite web |last1=Finn |first1=Helena Kane |title=Cultural Terrorism and Wahhabi Islam |url=http://www.cfr.org/world/cultural-terrorism-wahhabi-islam/p5234 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904022946/http://www.cfr.org/world/cultural-terrorism-wahhabi-islam/p5234 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 September 2014 |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |accessdate=4 August 2014 |ref=October 8, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosovo===
One country where Saudi Arabia has been particularly successful in spreading strict and conservative Wahhabism where once tolerant local Islam held sway is Kosovo.&lt;ref name="nyt-21-3-2016"/&gt; 
Following the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing campaign]] of 1999 that helped Muslim Kosovo gain independence from Orthodox Christian Serbia, the Saudi government&lt;ref name="Saudi aid to Kosovo continues"&gt;[http://www.saudiembassy.net/1999News/News/ForDetail.asp?cIndex=2076 Saudi aid to Kosovo continues]. Saudi Embassy, 31 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; 
and private sources began to provide aid.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;Gardner, Frank. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/327453.stm World: Middle East Gulf Arabs aid Kosovo refugees]. [[BBC News]], April 24, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saudi aid to Kosovo continues"/&gt; 
Saudi citizens donated $20 million to Kosovo in cash as well as food and medical supplies, and the Saudi Red Crescent sent medical volunteers.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;  
The Saudi Joint Committee for Collection of Donations for Kosovo and Chechnya sent $45 million  for humanitarian relief services (medical care, refugee camps, education, and later reconstruction of mosques and schools) to Kosovo according to the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in the US.&lt;ref name="Merdjanova-2013-64"/&gt;

240 mosques have been built in Kosovo since the 1999 war.&lt;ref name="nyt-21-3-2016"/&gt;  The Saudi Joint Committee for Relief of Kosovo and Chechnya built approximately 100 mosques in rural areas, some with Quranic schools adjacent, and sent 388 foreign teachers to spread "their interpretations of Islam".&lt;ref name=Merdjanova-65&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merdjanova|first1=Ina|title=Rediscovering the Umma: Muslims in the Balkans Between Nationalism and ...|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AA6ZsZhwU5oC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=saudi+aid+to+kosovo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nfxUVYTZKMraoAT_0IDoBw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=saudi%20aid%20to%20kosovo&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi-sponsored charities sponsored education, classes not only in religion but English and computers, often paying salaries and overhead costs. Families were given monthly stipends. All this was appreciated in the "poor and war ravaged" country but local Kosovar imams complained that stipends were given "on the condition that they attended sermons in the mosque and that women and girls wore the veil". “People were so needy, there was no one who did not join,” according to one Kosovo politician (Ajnishahe Halimi).&lt;ref name="nyt-21-3-2016"/&gt;

According to a critical article by journalist Carlotta Gall, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;corps of extremist clerics and secretive associations funded by Saudi Arabia and other conservative Arab countries in the Persian Gulf region using an obscure, labyrinthine network of donations from charities, private individuals and government ministries ... [They]  transformed this once-tolerant Muslim society at the hem of Europe into a font of Islamic extremism and a pipeline for jihadists.&lt;ref name="nyt-21-3-2016"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Conservatives came to dominate the Islamic Community of Kosovo, the national Islamic organization.&lt;ref name="nyt-21-3-2016"/&gt;

Part of the Wahhabi influence can be found in more strict practices, such as the refusal by some women to shake hands with or talk to male relatives. But threats — or acts — of violence against academics, journalists and politicians have also occurred. One imam in the city of [[Gjilan]], Enver Rexhepi, was "abducted and savagely beaten by masked men" in 2004 after clashing with a Saudi trained student (Zekirja Qazimi) over whether to continue the long-standing practice of displaying the Albanian flag in his (Rexhepi's) mosque. (Qazimi believed the depiction of the dragon on the flag idolatrous.)&lt;ref name="nyt-21-3-2016"/&gt;
Kosovo also had "the highest number" of Muslims per capita of any country in Europe leave to fight for [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] in the two years from 2014-2016. Kosovar police have identified 314 people who have left Kosovo to join the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], "including two suicide bombers, 44 women and 28 children".&lt;ref name="nyt-21-3-2016"/&gt;

After two Muslims from Kosovo killed themselves in suicide bombings in Iraq and Turkey, Kosovo intelligence began an investigation of  "sources of radicalism."  The Saudi charity Al Waqf al Islami and twelve other Islamic charities were shut down, and 40 people arrested.&lt;ref name="nyt-21-3-2016"/&gt;

Saudi aid has also affected the architecture of Islam in Kosovo, leading to the dismantling of centuries-old Ottoman mosques whose ornamentation was offensive to Wahhabism, including the Hadim Suleiman Aga mosque and Library in Djakovica, Kosovo.&lt;ref name=Archnet&gt;{{cite web|title=Hadim Suleiman Aga Library. Djakovica, Kosovo|url=http://archnet.org/sites/6081|website=Archnet|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among the destroyed buildings are "a historic library in Gjakova and several 400-year-old mosques, as well as shrines, graveyards and Dervish monasteries".&lt;ref name="nyt-21-3-2016"/&gt;

According to Carlotta Gall, as of 2016 "Kosovo Central Bank figures show grants from Saudi Arabia averaging €100,000 a year for the past five years", a reduction from the decade earlier, (although payments can be diverted through another country" to obscure their origin and destination"). Picking up the slack in financing "hard-line" Islam have been [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] — each of which average "approximately €1 million a year" in donations.&lt;ref name="nyt-21-3-2016"/&gt;

[[Sudan]], a poor country with a majority Muslim Arab population whose coastline lies just across the [[Red Sea]] from the [[Hijaz]] province of Saudi Arabia, has had close relations with the kingdom since the [[1973 oil crisis|Arab Oil Embargo]].  However, the dominant interpretation of [[Islam in Sudan]] was very different from that of Saudis or Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:177"&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.177&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional popular Islam of the [[Sufi]] or mystical brotherhoods (the [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]] and the [[Khatmiya]]) who were each attached to a political party,&lt;ref&gt;the [[Umma Party (Sudan)|Umma Party]] for Ansar and the [[Democratic Unionist Party (Sudan)|Democratic Unionist Party]] for Khatmiya&lt;/ref&gt; had great influence among the masses of Muslims.  Saudi funding, investment, and labor migration from Sudan has all worked over time to change that.

In the fall of 1977, an Islamic bank with 60% of its start up capital coming from Saudi Arabia opened a branch in Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;Moussa Yaqoub, ''Muhammad Faysal Al Saoud: malamih min tajriba al iqtissadiyya al islamiyya'' (Aspects of Experience in the Islamic Economy) (Jeddah: Saudi Publishing and Distributing House, 1998), esp. pp.54-55, 60, quoted in Kepel, Gilles, ''Jihad'', 2002, p.180&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1980s this bank ([[Faisal Islamic Bank of Sudan]]) was second biggest in Sudan in terms of money held on deposit.&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:180"&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.180&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after another similar bank (Al Baraka Bank) was founded. Both provided rewards for whose affiliated with Hassan al-Turabi's Islamist [[National Islamic Front]]—employment and wealth as a reward for young militant college graduates and low interest loans for investors and businessmen unable to find loans elsewhere.&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:180" /&gt;

In 1983 Saudis persuaded then-President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] to institute [[sharia]] law&lt;ref name="MERIP" /&gt; including interest-free Islamic banking. The  traditional Sudanese banking system was abolished and afterwards
&lt;blockquote&gt;any enterprise that needed capital had to be part of Turabi's network to gain access to financial markets. Over time, this has concentrated economic power in the old families from the "Three Tribes" who were loyal to the new regime"&lt;ref name="Natsios-90"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wuffMW1e5BwC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=offshoot+of+the+Sudanese+branch+of+the+Muslim+Brotherhood,+the+Islamic+Charter+Front&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=90g4Ve_JBszUoASk8oDAAw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=offshoot%20of%20the%20Sudanese%20branch%20of%20the%20Muslim%20Brotherhood%2C%20the%20Islamic%20Charter%20Front&amp;f=false|title=Sudan, South Sudan, and Darfur: What Everyone Needs to Know|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press.|pages=90|last1=Natsios|first1=Andrew S.|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;and who have "transformed themselves into Islamists."

The influx of Sudanese labor migrants to Saudi as truck drivers, electricians, factory workers and sales clerks, was also significant.  By 1985, according to one source, about 2/3 of the professional and skilled Sudanese workers were employed outside the Sudan, many in the Gulf States.&lt;ref name=eprism&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warburg|first1=Gabriel R.|title=THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IN SUDAN: FROM REFORMS TO RADICALISM*|url=http://www.e-prism.org/images/Muslim_BROTHERS.PRISM.pdf|website=e-prism.org|publisher=THE PROJECT FOR THE RESEARCH OF ISLAMIST MOVEMENTS (PRISM)|accessdate=28 April 2015|date=August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (As of 2013 there were 900,000 Sudanese migrant workers in Saudi Arabia.)&lt;ref name="ST-6-11-13"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article48701|title=300,000 Sudanese expat workers could face deportation from Saudi Arabia: report|date=6 November 2013|publisher=sudan tribune|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at the change in religious practices of a village in northern Sudan over a five-year period from 1982 to 1988, anthropology researcher Victoria Bernal found  labor migration of villagers to Saudi Arabia "were catalysts for change, stimulating the rise of `fundamentalist` Islam in the village". Returning migrants "boldly" critiqued the Islamic authenticity of local practices such as "mourning rituals, wedding customs and reverence for holy men in particular."  More well-to-do villagers were "building high brick or cement walls around their homes", women began wearing ankle-length robes. Traditional wedding rituals with singing and mixing of genders were called into question.&lt;ref name="MERIP" /&gt;

"Adopting fundamentalist practices" had become a "way to assert one’s sophistication, urbanity and material success." &lt;ref name="MERIP" /&gt; Migrant workers also formed connections with, and helped finance, the Muslim Brotherhood affiliated [[National Islamic Front]] political party which could remit their salaries back home to families in Sudan evading taxation in exchange for a percentage (that was less than the taxation).&lt;ref name="eprism2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-prism.org/images/Muslim_BROTHERS.PRISM.pdf|title=THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IN SUDAN: FROM REFORMS TO RADICALISM*|date=August 2006|website=e-prism.org|publisher=THE PROJECT FOR THE RESEARCH OF ISLAMIST MOVEMENTS (PRISM)|last1=Warburg|first1=Gabriel R.|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saudi helped found the African Islamic Center (later the [[International University of Africa]]) to help train African Muslim preachers and missionaries "with the [[Salafist]] view of Islam."&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:181"&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.181&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
Muslim Brethren who became wealthy in Saudi Arabia became key contributors to Egypt's Islamist movements.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:51&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Sagiv, ''Fundamentalism and Intellectuals in Egypt, 1973-1999'', (London: Frank Cass, 1995), p.47&lt;/ref&gt;   Many of Egypt's future ''[[ulama]]'' attended the [[Islamic University of Madinah]] in Saudi which was established as an alternative to the Egyptian government-controlled [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo.

=== Algeria ===
Political Islam and/or salafist "Islamic revivalism" became dominant and the indigenous "popular" or Sufi Islam  found in much of North Africa greatly weakened, in large part because  of the 1954-1962 [[Algerian War]]—despite the fact the victorious [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) was interested in socialism and Arab nationalism, not political Islam.

Diminishing indigenous Islam was the dismantling of Sufi mystical brotherhoods and the confiscation and redistribution  of their land in retaliation for their lack of support for the FLN during the [[Algerian War|fight against the French]].&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:166"&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.166&lt;/ref&gt;  Strengthening revivalism was a campaign of Arabization and Islamization by the government (FLN)  to suppress the use of the French language (which was still dominant in higher education and the professions), to promote Algerian/Arab identity over residual French colonial culture. To do this Egyptians were recruited by the Algerian state to Arabize and de-Frenchify the school system. Like Saudi Arabia, Algeria saw an influx of Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]] members hired to teach Arabic and eager to escape government suppression. While the leftist FLN Algerian government was totally  uninterested in Islam as a foundation for conducting worldly affairs (as opposed to building a national identity), the Muslim Brotherhood teachers very much were, and many of the generation of "strictly Arabphone teachers" trained by the Brothers adopted the beliefs of their teachers and went on to form the basis of a "Islamist intelligentsia".&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:162-3"&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.162-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, in the 1980s, as interest in Islam grew and devotion to the ruling [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) party and secular socialism waned in Algeria, the government imported two renowned Islamic scholars, [[Mohammed al-Ghazali]] and [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], to "strengthen the religious dimension" of the "nationalist ideology" of the FLN.  This was less than successful as the clerics supported "Islamic awakening", were "[[fellow traveler]]s" of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], supporters of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies, and had little interest in serving the secularist FLN government.&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:165"&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1980s, several hundred youth left Algeria for the camps of [[Peshawar]] to fight [[Afghan Arabs|jihad in Afghanistan]]. As the FLN government was a close ally of the jihadists' enemy, the [[Soviet Union]], these fighters tended to consider the fight against the Soviets a "prelude" to jihad in Algeria.&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:164"&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

When the FLN followed the example of post-Communist Eastern European government and held elections in 1989, the main beneficiary was the massively popular [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS) political party which sought to establish [[sharia]] law in Algeria.  "Islamist intelligentsia" formed its leadership, FIS second in command, [[Ali Belhadj]], was a state school teacher and a prime example or this.&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:162-3"&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.162-3&lt;/ref&gt; The Saudis supporting the party,&lt;ref name="ORFPI1994:1192"&gt;[[#ORFPI1994|Roy, ''Failure of Political Islam'', 1994]]: p.119&lt;/ref&gt; and the Front's other co-leader [[Abbassi Madani]] received much aid from Saudi Arabia and other oil monarchies. (This did not prevent him from coming out in support of [[Sadam Hussein]]—along with most other Islamists—when Saddam [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded Kuwait]], despite the adamant fear of and opposition to [[Saddam Hussein]] by the Gulf oil states.)&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:172-3"&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.172-3&lt;/ref&gt;

After the FLN saw how unpopular it was and canceled the elections, a bloody civil war broke out. The Salafist-jihadis returning to Algeria supported the FIS and later provided military skill in the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria]] (GIA).&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:164" /&gt;

The [[Algerian Civil War]] ended badly with an estimated 200,000 Algerians, many of them civilians, killed.  FIS did not recover from the war, but by  2002 another strict/conservative Islamic force—Salafism—began to emerge.&lt;ref name="Boukhars" /&gt; To end the war, the government needed help disarming the Islamists fighters and were able to enlist the Salafis—apolitical and nonviolent&lt;ref name="Boukhars" /&gt;—as a religious counterweight and to use their religious influence to persuade the Islamists to stop fighting. In return the government has shown tolerance towards the Salafis.&lt;ref name="Chikhi-10-8-10" /&gt; Culturally, as of 2010 Salafis have exerted "a growing influence over society and how people dress, deal with the state and do business" in Algeria. Their putative quietism notwithstanding they have protested a government plan to make women remove their headscarves for passport photographs, pressuring shopkeepers to stop selling tobacco and alcohol.&lt;ref name="Chikhi-10-8-10"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-algeria-religion-salafism-idUSTRE6791TQ20100810|title=Hard-line Islam steps out of shadows in Algeria|date=10 August 2010|agency=Reuters|last1=Chikhi|first1=Lamine|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boukhars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2015/11/24/quietist-and-firebrand-salafism-in-algeria-pub-62075|title=‘Quietist’ and ‘Firebrand’ Salafism in Algeria|website=carnegie endowment|last1=Boukhars|first1=Anouar|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, a group of Salafist clerics attending an official function along with the minister of religious affairs showed their rejection of modern political systems as an illegitimate innovation or "''[[bid‘ah]]''"  by refusing to stand for the national anthem.&lt;ref name="Chikhi-10-8-10" /&gt; Salafist Sheikh Abdelfettah Zeraoui explains criticism of Salafism as the work of  Western powers who have pressured Muslim governments "to crack down on the Salafi current because it represents the pure Islam."&lt;ref name="Chikhi-10-8-10" /&gt;  The Salafis connection with Saudi Arabia includes Saudi Grand Mufti, Sheikh [[Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh|Abdul-Aziz al-Sheikh]] who has endorsed  opposition to international regulations requiring photographs for passports show a person's forehead and ears even if they are a woman.

== Central Asia and Caucasus ==
Scholar [[Vitaly Naumkin|Vitaliĭ Vi͡acheslavovich Naumkin]] argues that even before the fall of Communism, Saudi Arabia had substantial influence on Islam in Central Asia because of its prestige as the location of the [[Hajj|holy places of Hejaz]], its financial resources and because of the large number of Central Asian pilgrims (and their descendants) who had gone to Saudi on [[hajj]] and decided to stay.&lt;ref name="Naumkin-2005-38"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naumkin|first1=Vitaliĭ Vi͡acheslavovich|title=Radical Islam in Central Asia: Between Pen and Rifle|date=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vwxP3gPUkMC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=Islamic+Movement+of+Uzbekistan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilmpq12PzUAhUm24MKHYZ-A1EQ6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Islamic%20Movement%20of%20Uzbekistan&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the  [[Soviet–Afghan War]], thousands of Soviet Central Asians were drafted into the Soviet Army to fight their co-religionists (and sometimes fellow ethics), the Afghan Mujahideen. As Islam and Central Asian peoples had been repressed by the Soviets—often brutally&lt;ref name="Rashid, 2002-01-14"/&gt;—many were "deeply affected by the dedication" of their putative enemies. "Hundreds of Uzbek and Tajik Muslims travelled secretly to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to study in madrasahs or to train as guerrilla fighters against the Soviets in Afghanistan." Many of these were influenced by the idea of armed jihad taught at Deobandi madrasahs in Pakistan where "places specifically for Central Asian radicals, who arrived without passports or visas and received a free education and a living allowance."&lt;ref name="Rashid, 2002-01-14"/&gt; Wahhabism also made headway thanks to Saudi funding and Saudi-trained preachers.
In the late 1980s, as the same time the Soviets were starting to withdraw from Afghanistan there was "an explosion of interest" in Islam in Central Asia. "Thousands of mosques were built, Qurans and other Islamic literature were brought in from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and distributed free among the population."&lt;ref name="Rashid, 2002-01-14"/&gt;

In Central Asia the term "Wahhabism" has evolved from its original meaning of followers of [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]], to become 'agitprop invective' and a ‘polemic foil in sectarian arguments'  used against Islamic "reformists and ‘troublesome Muslim opponents’", or even against "any and all expressions of nontraditional Islam’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/central-asia/Central_Asian_Topics/sub8_8f/entry-4523.html|title=RELIGION AND ISLAM IN CENTRAL ASIA {{!}} Facts and Details|last=Hays|first=Jeffrey|website=factsanddetails.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi and Islamist forces helped the Afghan Mujahideen in their struggle against the Soviets, with Saudi Arabian  government  providing approximately $4 billion in aid to the mujahidin from 1980-1990.&lt;ref name=DGHK2003:127&gt;[[#DGHK2003|Gold, ''Hatred's Kingdom'', 2003]]: p.127&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the [[Taliban]] were graduates of these schools.&lt;ref name="Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25"&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994–1997'', [[Oxford University Press]], (1999), pp. 25–6&lt;/ref&gt;   (Eight Taliban government ministers came from one school, Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Rashid, ''Taliban'', p.90&lt;/ref&gt;) While in power, the Taliban implemented the "strictest interpretation of [[Sharia|Sharia law]] ever seen in the [[Muslim world]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid,''Taliban,'' (2000), p.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maley"&gt;Dupree Hatch, Nancy.

After the Taliban came to power the Saudis helped them in a number of ways.  Saudi Arabia was one of only three countries (Pakistan and United Arab Emirates being the others) officially to recognize the Taliban as the official government of Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks, (after 9/11 no country recognized it). King Fahd of Saudi Arabia “expressed happiness at the good measures taken by the Taliban and over the imposition of shari’a in our country," During a visit by the Taliban’s leadership to the kingdom in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Algar, Hamid, ''Wahhabism: A Critical Essay'', p.57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Wahhabism practices, influenced the Taliban. One example was the [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|Saudi religious police]], according to Rashid. &lt;blockquote&gt;
`I remember that all the Taliban who had worked or done hajj in Saudi Arabia were terribly impressed by the religious police and tried to copy that system to the letter. The money for their training and salaries came partly from Saudi Arabia.`&lt;/blockquote&gt; The taliban also practiced [[Public executions in Saudi Arabia|public beheadings]] common in Saudi Arabia. Ahmed Rashid came across ten thousand men and children gathering at Kandahar football stadium one Thursday afternoon, curious as to why (the Taliban had banned sports) he "went inside to discover a convicted murderer being led between the goalposts to be executed by a member of the victim's family." &lt;ref name=lacey-200-police&gt;{{cite book|last=Lacey|first=Robert|title=Inside the Kingdom : Kings, Clerics, Modernists, Terrorists, and the Struggle for Saudi Arabia|date=2009|publisher=Viking

|quote=`I remember` says Ahmed Rashid, `that all the Taliban who had worked or done hajj in Saudi Arabia were terribly impressed by the religious police and tried to copy that system to the letter. The money for their training and salaries came partly from Saudi Arabia.` Ahmed Rashid took the trouble to collect and document the Taliban's medieval flailings against the modern West, and a few months later he stumbled on a spectacle that they were organizing for popular entertainment. Wondering why ten thousand men and children were gathering so eagerly in the Kandahar football stadium one Thursday afternoon, he went inside to discover a convicted murderer being led between the goalposts to be executed by a member of the victim's family.

The Taliban's brutal treatment of Shia Muslims, and the destruction of [[Buddhas of Bamiyan#Attacks on the Buddha.27s statue|Buddhist statues in Bamiyan Valley]] may also have been influenced by Wahhabism, which had a history of attacking and [[takfir]]ing Shia, while prior to this attack Afghan Sunnis had never persecuted their Shia minority.&lt;ref name=DGHK2003:133&gt;[[#DGHK2003|Gold, ''Hatred's Kingdom'', 2003]]: p.133&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=August 2018}} (see [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] and [[1888–1893 Uprisings of Hazaras]]).

Another activity Afghan Muslims had not engaged in before this time was destruction of statues. In 2001, the Taliban dynamited and rocketed the nearly 2000-year-old statues Buddhist Bamiyan Valley, which had been undamaged by Afghan Sunni Muslim for centuries prior to then. Mullah Omar declared "Muslims should be proud of smashing idols. It has given praise to Allah that we have destroyed them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Markos Moulitsas Zúniga |coauthors= |title=American Taliban: How War, Sex, Sin, and Power Bind Jihadists and the Radical Right |year=2010 |publisher=Polipoint Press |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Cdx6yTUFxIC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=%22Muslims+should+be+proud+of+smashing+idols%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Hl1nwYSxkK&amp;sig=rG9zIIyemmmJytx4C5aP6fpP8Js&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=D_niTJ6OK8SjnQfH6-zWDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Muslims%20should%20be%20proud%20of%20smashing%20idols%22&amp;f=false |isbn=1-936227-02-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uzbekistan===

The leadership of the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]] (IMU) has been influenced by the Wahhabi and Deobandi traditions. IMU head, [[Juma Namangani]], (who was killed in November 2001) was indirectly influenced by outside Islamic revival when serving in the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet army in Afghanistan]] fighting Afghan mujahideen. He was radicalized by the experience and returning to his home in the [[Fergana Valley]] wanting to fight on the side of the Islamic revival not against it. He associated with local Islamists of the [[Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan|Islamic Renaissance Party]] (IRP) and the local Islamic revolutionary party ''Adolat'' ({{lang-en|Justice}}),&lt;ref name="Rashid, 2002-01-14"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Rashid |first=Ahmed |date=14 January 2002 |title=They're Only Sleeping: Why militant Islamicists in Central Asia aren't going to go away |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/01/14/theyre-only-sleeping |dead-url=no |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6f6GZzyJo?url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/01/14/theyre-only-sleeping |archive-date=6 February 2016 |access-date=6 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a founder of the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="Rashid, 2002-01-14"/&gt;
In 1995, Namangani traveled to Saudi Arabia to undergo "religious and intelligence training from Saudi intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ismor.com/cornwallis/cornwallis_2005/CX_2005_11-Baranick-CX-July%2012.pdf |title=Addressing Terrorist Threats in Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan: Winning Hearts and Minds|last1=Salayeva|first1=Rena|last2=Baranick |first2=Michael J.  |date=|website=ismor.com|page=196|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to journalist Ahmed Rashid, the IMU &lt;blockquote&gt;is believed to have been funded by Saudis, Pakistanis, Turks, Iranians, and Osama bin Laden. Namangani was one of the most important “foreign Taliban” commanders in northern Afghanistan during the recent fighting there. He led a pan-Islamic force of Uzbeks, Tajiks, Pakistanis, Chechens, and Uighurs from Xinjiang province in China. They fought on the side of the Taliban in Afghanistan, but their long-range goal was to establish an Islamic state throughout Central Asia.&lt;ref name="Rashid, 2002-01-14"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Caucasus ===
Wahhabism or Salafism has been particularly successful in the ex-Soviet Muslim-majority areas such as [[Dagestan]] and [[Chechnya]] for a number of reasons, according to [[Robert Bruce Ware]].
* Wahhabi funding, institutions, and missionaries are particularly useful because they fill the gap left by the collapse of the [[USSR]], where traditional Islamic leaders were relatively unknowledgeable, and accustomed to surviving by subservience;&lt;ref name="Ware-91-2" /&gt;
* Wahhabism fills the ideological void left by the collapse of socialism;&lt;ref name="Ware-91-2" /&gt;
* the Wahhabi adversarial role toward non-Wahhabi government (i.e. Russia's) fills the traditional role of Islam toward the Russian government and

Although two-thirds of Azerbaijanis are members of the Shiite branch of Islam,&lt;ref name="RMSARI"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ehrmann|first2=Maya|date=Fall 2013|title=The Rise of Militant Salafism in Azerbaijan and Its Regional Implications|url=http://www.mepc.org/journal/middle-east-policy-archives/rise-militant-salafism-azerbaijan-and-its-regional-implications?print|journal=Middle East Policy Council|volume=XX|issue=3|last1=Souleimanov|first1=Emil|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which Wahhabis/Salafis strongly oppose), and Muslims in Azerbaijan have a tradition of secularism, Wahhabism/Salafism has made headway among the one third of the country that identify themselves as Sunni Muslims and primarily inhabit the northern and western regions,&lt;ref name="RMSARI" /&gt;  specifically those of Dagestani ethnicity (Avars, Lezgins, Tsakhurs, Rutuls) in  areas bordering Dagestan.

Wahhabism/Salafism was introduced and catalyzed  starting with the dissolution of the Soviet Union by missionaries and funds from Arab countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,&lt;ref name="RMSARI" /&gt;  and Salafists mainly from Chechnya and Dagestan.  In 1997, the Azerbaijani branch of the Kuwaiti Revival of Islamic Heritage society, built the Abu Bakr mosque in [[Baku]], the capital.

Although Georgia is predominantly Christian, it has Muslim minorities.

In 2013 when the Bangladeshi government cracked down on Jamaat-e Islami for war crimes during the Bangladesh liberation war, Saudi Arabia expressed its displeasure by cutting back on the number of Bangladeshi guest workers allowed to work in (and sent badly needed remittances from) Saudi Arabia.[55]

Bangladesh also receives a concession from Saudi on the price of oil imports.

One way conservative Saudi religious practices are spread is through schools. Nearly 6 million Bangladeshi children attend schools at (private) Quomi madrassas.

With the help of funding from Saudi Arabia and other sources, thousands of religious schools (madrasses) were established during the 1980s in Pakistan, usually [[Deobandi]] in doctrine and often sponsored by Jamaati Ulama Islam. "This rapid expansion came at the expense of doctrinal coherence as there were not enough qualified teachers to staff all the new schools. Quite a few teachers did not discern between tribal values of their ethnic group, the [[Pashtuns|Pushtuns]] and the religious ideals. The result was an interpretation of Islam that blended [[Pushtun]] ideals and [[Deobandi]] views, precisely the hallmark of the Taliban." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ebooks.rahnuma.org/religion/Muslim_Sects/The-Wahhabi-Mission-and-Saudi-Arabia.pdf|title=The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia|last=Commins|first=David|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2009|pages=191–2|quote=Jamaati Ulama Islam ... figured as a fairly minor part of Pakistan's religious scene until the regime of General Zia al-Haq ... who used an Islamic policy to buttress his military dictatorship.

Their number grew from around 900 in 1971 to over 8000 official ones and another 25,000 unofficial ones in 1988. With financial support from Saudi Arabia, Deobandi madrasas were part of this vast proliferation in religious education, much of it located in Afghan refugee camps that sprang up in the 1980s.  This rapid expansion came at the expense of doctrinal coherence as there were not enough qualified teachers to staff all the new schools. Quite a few teachers did not discern between tribal values of their ethnic group, the Pushtuns and the religious ideals.

Another complaint about religious schools leading to extremism comes from a 2008 US diplomatic cable released by [[WikiLeaks]] concerning southern [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] (specifically the Multan, Bahawalpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan Divisions there),
&lt;blockquote&gt;government and non-governmental sources claimed that financial support estimated at nearly $100 million [[United States dollar|USD]] annually was making its way to Deobandi and Ahl-e-Hadith clerics in the region from "missionary" and "Islamic charitable" organizations in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ostensibly with the direct support of those governments.&lt;ref name="Butt-HP-1-2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Butt|first1=Yousaf|title=How Saudi Wahhabism Is the Fountainhead of Islamist Terrorism |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-yousaf-butt-/saudi-wahhabism-islam-terrorism_b_6501916.html |accessdate=31 October 2015|agency=World Post|date=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wikileaks-ERRSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08LAHORE302_a.html|title=(S/NF) EXTREMIST RECRUITMENT ON THE RISE IN SOUTHERN PUNJAB|date=2008-11-13|website=wikileaks.org|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;But the diplomat complained many of the students ended up in terrorist training camps.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The network reportedly exploited worsening poverty in these areas of the province to recruit children into the divisions' growing Deobandi and Ahl-eHadith madrassa network from which they were indoctrinated into jihadi philosophy, deployed to regional training/indoctrination centers, and ultimately sent to terrorist training camps in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).&lt;ref name="Butt-HP-1-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wikileaks-ERRSP" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;One militant who has fought for Wahhabi-style Islam in Pakistan is [[Sufi Mohammad]].

An example of the conflict between Wahhabi influence and supporters of the traditional popular and (more tolerant) Islam has been described (and criticized) by Pakistani journalist Sayyed Shah. In Shah's home village (in northwest Pakistan), the villagers "were Sunni, but our culture, our traditions were a mixture of Shia and [[Barelvi]] and Deobandi,” and included handing "out sweets and water” during Shia public self-lashings at a local Barelvi shrine. A preacher trained in a Saudi-funded seminary came to the village and denounced the Barelvi and Shiite beliefs as false and heretical. By 2010 “everything had changed.” Some women began wearing full burqas. Militants began attacking "kiosks where merchants sold secular music CDs". Two attempts were made to destroy the Barelvi shrine with bombs. The village, including families, were divided between those who wanted Saudi Wahhabi religion and those who did not.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-islam.html|title=Saudis and Extremism: ‘Both the Arsonists and the Firefighters’|last=Shane|first=Scott|date=2016-08-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Other scholars argue that outside influences are not alone in generating sectarianism and jihadist violence in Pakistan,  which has roots in the country’s origins in the partition of India in 1947.)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Both affluent and poor schools, in both [[Java]] and more remote islands are beneficiaries of Saudi largess. As of 2016, the number of "pesantren" (religious boarding schools) following the Salafi ''manhaj'' (path) had grown to about 100.&lt;ref name="Scott-NYRoB" /&gt;  The libraries of other pesantren — including the prestigious [[Pondok Modern Darussalam Gontor|Gontor pesantren]] in East Java — are filled with books from Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="PERLEZ-indon" /&gt;   The Saudi religious affairs office in Jakarta provides about one million Arabic religious books translated into Indonesian every year. The titles include "Questions and Answers about Islamic Principles," by Bin Baaz, one of Saudi Arabia's most venerated interpreters of Islam.&lt;ref name="PERLEZ-indon" /&gt;  As of 2003, a pew poll found Crown Prince Abdullah, was rated as one of the three leaders Indonesians trusted the most.&lt;ref name="PERLEZ-indon" /&gt;

As the Wahhabism/Salafism has expanded, some Indonesia have become alarmed at what they call the "arabization" of their country and called for an Islam with freedom of opinion and tolerance, that does not reject pluralism and democracy.&lt;ref name="Scott-NYRoB" /&gt;  A graduate of LIPIA (Farid Okhbah) helped found the National Anti-Shia Alliance (ANNAS) of Indonesia (the founder of Wahhabism believed Shia to be heretics and a series of attacks on Shia have occurred in East Java). Although Shia make up only about 1% of the population of the country, Okhbah has called Shia Islam a bigger threat to Indonesia than communism in the 1960s and urged the sect be banded.&lt;ref name="Scott-NYRoB" /&gt;

According to Sidney Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta, Saudi influence “has contributed to a more conservative, more intolerant atmosphere,” and may be behind campaigns  against Shia and [[Persecution of Ahmadis#Indonesia|Ahmadi]] Islam, (both of which Wahhabis consider heretics) but very few of the Indonesians arrested on terrorism charges in Indonesia since 2002, have any ties to "Wahhabi or Salafi institutions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, according to a 2003 article in the New York Times, Saudis have also discretely provided funds for "militant Islamic groups".&lt;ref name="PERLEZ-indon" /&gt; The Saudi foundation [[Al Haramain]] financed educational institutions with the approval of the Indonesian Ministry of Religion, and "served as a conduit"  for money to [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], a Southeast Asian Islamist organization that aims to build Islamic states in the region and has bombed many civilian targets.&lt;ref name="PERLEZ-indon" /&gt; (The spiritual guide of Jemaah Islamiyyah ([[Abu Bakar Bashir]]) has now pledged his allegiance to [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]].)&lt;ref name="Scott-NYRoB" /&gt;

===Malaysia===
In 1980 Prince Muhammad al-Faysal of Saudi Arabia offered that Malaysia $100 million for an interest-free finance corporation, and two years later the Saudis helped finance the government-sponsored Bank Islam Malaysia.&lt;ref name="pipes-314"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x4oNgMS3n6IC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314&amp;dq=pipes+%22in+the+path+of+god%22+%22islamic+economic+system%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E4rZnf_C19&amp;sig=Uxr_vM-rlsgbL_ku1a1pxCGxzng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ln8ZVdmgMNPtoAT6r4LIDA&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pipes%20%22in%20the%20path%20of%20god%22%20%22islamic%20economic%20system%22&amp;f=false|title=In the Path of God: Islam and Political Power|origyear=1980|year=2009|publisher=Transaction Publishers|edition=5th|page=314|quote=When Prince Muhammad al-Faysal of Saudi Arabia visited Malaysia in December 1980, he offered $100 million for an interest-free finance corporation.

'''Islam in Iceland''' is a minority religion. The [[Pew Research Center]] estimated that less than 10,000 people in Iceland were Muslim in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projection-table/|title=Religious Composition by Country, 2010-2050|last=|first=|last2=|date=2015-04-02|website=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-20|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Islam by country}}In 2011 the Muslims of Iceland attracted the interest of [[Al Jazeera]], which planned a documentary dealing with Muslims in Iceland and New Zealand. Al Jazeera was interested in how [[Ramadan]] is honored in the higher latitudes where the night can be of unusual length when compared to the majority-Muslim lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/Al_Jazeera_Shoots_Documentary_on_Icelandic_Muslims_0_381183.news.aspx|title=Al Jazeera Shoots Documentary on Icelandic Muslims|date=17 Aug 2011|newspaper=Iceland Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest mention of [[Iceland]] in [[Muslim]] sources originates in the works of [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] (1099–1165/66) in his famous ''[[Tabula Rogeriana]]'', which mentions Iceland's location in the [[North Sea]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The long-distance trading and raiding networks of the [[Viking]]s will have meant that various Icelanders, like the Norwegians [[Rögnvald Kali Kolsson]] or [[Harald Hardrada]], came into direct contact with the Muslim world during the Middle Ages;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Price, 'The Vikings in Spain, North Africa and the Mediterranean', in ''The Viking World'', ed. by Stefan Brink and Neil Price (Abingdon: Routledge, 2008), pp. 462--69.&lt;/ref&gt; indirect connections are best attested by finds of Arabic coins in Iceland, as also widely in the Viking world.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. the hoard found at the farm Keta in Skefilsstaðhreppur: Fedir Androshchuk and
Ragnheiður Traustadóttir, 'A Viking Age Spearhead from Kolkuós', Hólarannsóknin Framvinduskýrsla 6 (2004), https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Viking_Age_Spearheads.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Iceland's conversion to Christianity around 1000, some Icelanders encountered the Islamic world through pilgrimage, for example to Jerusalem, of the kind described by Abbot Nikulás Bergsson in his ''[[Leiðarvísir og borgarskipan]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

From around the late thirteenth century, a fantastical version of the Islamic world is prominent in medieval Icelandic [[Chivalric sagas|romance]], partly inspired by Continental narratives influenced by the Crusades. Although this image generally characterises the Islamic world as 'heathen', and repeats the misconceptions of Islam widespread in the medieval West,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, John Stanley, 'Attitudes to Islam from the ''Chansons de geste'' to the ''Riddarasögur''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', ''Parergon'', n. s. 8.2 (1990), 81-95. DOI: 10.1353/pgn.1990.0001&lt;/ref&gt; it also varies substantially from text to text, sometimes, for example, associating the Islamic world with great wealth, wisdom, or chivalry.&lt;ref&gt;Sverrir Jakobsson, ''Við og veröldin: Heimsmynd Íslendinga 1100-1400'' (Reykjavík: Háskólaútgáfan, 2005), pp. 130-60. Cf. Sheryl Elizabeth McDonald Werronen, 'Transforming Popular Romance on the Edge of the World: ''Nítíða saga'' in Late Medieval and Early Modern Iceland' (unpublished PhD thesis, University of Leeds, 2013), pp. 150--56; Bjørn Bandlien, 'Muslims in ''Karlamagnúss saga'' and ''Elíss saga ok Rósamundar'' ' and Geraldine Barnes, 'Byzantium in the ''riddarasögur'' ', in ''Á austrvega: Saga and East Scandinavia. Preprint Papers of the 14th International Saga Conference, Uppsala, 9th–15th August 2009''. Eds. Agneta Ney, Henrik Williams, and Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist. Institutionen för humaniora och samhällsvetenskaps skriftserie 14. Gävle: Gävle UP, 2009. 1.85–91 and 1.92–98, http://www.saga.nordiska.uu.se/preprint.&lt;/ref&gt; Romance continued to serve as a medium for Icelanders to contemplate Islam in the post-medieval period, for example in [[Jón Oddsson Hjaltalín|Jón Oddsson Hjaltalín's]] eighteenth-century romance ''[[Fimmbræðra saga]]'', which combined traditional storytelling with Continental Enlightenment scholarship.

Perhaps the earliest known example of Muslims coming to Iceland occurred in 1627, when the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Muslim]] [[Jan Janszoon]] and his [[Barbary pirates]] raided portions of Iceland, including the southwest coast, [[Vestmannaeyjar]], and the eastern fjords.&lt;ref name="NielsenAkgönül2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jørgen Nielsen|author2=Samim Akgönül|author3=Ahmet Alibaši?|author4=Brigitte Maréchal |author5=Christian Moe|title=Yearbook of Muslims in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=068flHho1NEC&amp;pg=PA251|accessdate=9 September 2012|date=11 November 2010|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-18475-6|pages=251–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event is known in Icelandic history as the ''Tyrkjaránið'' (the "[[Turkish Abductions]]"). An estimated 400-800 Icelanders were sold into slavery.

Islam started to gain presence in Icelandic culture around the 1970s, partly through immigration from the Islamic world (for example [[Salmann Tamimi]]) and partly through Icelanders' exposure to Islamic culture while travelling (for example [[Ibrahim Sverrir Agnarsson]]). Some of the immigrants simply came of their own accord; others came as refugees, including groups from [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;Heimir Björnsson, 'Hvaða átt til Mekka? Stofnun trúfélags múslima á Íslandi, þróun þess og starf á Íslandi og barátta gegn fordómum' (unpublished BA thesis, University of Iceland), pp. 8-9. http://skemman.is/item/view/1946/2283; [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71385.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Koran]] was first translated into Icelandic in 1993, with a corrected edition in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;''Kóran'', trans. by Helgi Hálfdánarson, second edn, Reykjvík, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:MuInIce2012.png|right|thumb|Members of Muslim Associations in Iceland as a function of time]]

[[Salmann Tamimi]] estimates that when he came to Iceland in 1971 there were perhaps seven Muslims living there.&lt;ref name="Eygló Svala Arnarsdóttir 2014 p. 66"&gt;Eygló Svala Arnarsdóttir, 'To a Mosque on a Magic Carpet', ''Iceland Review'', 52.1 (2014), 64--68 (p. 66).&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, however,

*"Muslim Association of Iceland" (Félag múslima á Íslandi) has 465 members.
*"The Islamic Cultural Centre of Iceland" (Menningarsetur múslima á Íslandi) has 305 members.&lt;ref name="US"&gt;[http://hagstofan.is/?PageID=2593&amp;src=/temp/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=MAN10001%26ti=Mannfj%F6ldi+eftir+tr%FAf%E9l%F6gum+1998%2D2012++++++++++%26path=../Database/mannfjoldi/Trufelog/%26lang=3%26units=Fj%F6ldi ''Mannfjöldi eftir trúfélögum 1998-2012 '']. Hagstofan.is {{is icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of Muslims born in Iceland probably began with people like Salmann's own children, such as Yousef Ingi Tamimi (b. 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Viðar Þorsteinsson and Yousef Ingi Tamimi, 'Maður verður að hafa húmor fyrir sjálfum sér: Viđar Þorsteinsson og Yousef Ingi Tamimi ræða saman', in ''Íslam með afslætti'', ed. by Auður Jónsdóttir and Óttar Martin Norðfjörð, Afbók, 4 ([Reykjavík]: Nýhil, 2008), pp. 142-51 (p. 143).&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland's Muslim population is of diverse origins, including people born in the Arab world, Albania, Africa, and Iceland.&lt;ref name="skemman.is"&gt;Heimir Björnsson, 'Hvaða átt til Mekka? Stofnun trúfélags múslima á Íslandi, þróun þess og starf á Íslandi og barátta gegn fordómum' (unpublished BA thesis, University of Iceland), p. 13. http://skemman.is/item/view/1946/2283.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==

===Muslim Association of Iceland===
The [[Muslim Association of Iceland]] (''Félag múslima á Íslandi'') was founded in 1997 by [[Salmann Tamimi]], a Palestinian immigrant; it was officially recognised on February 25.&lt;ref&gt;Heimir Björnsson, 'Hvaða átt til Mekka? Stofnun trúfélags múslima á Íslandi, þróun þess og starf á Íslandi og barátta gegn fordómum' (unpublished BA thesis, University of Iceland), p. 6. http://skemman.is/item/view/1946/2283.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010 the chair has been [[Ibrahim Sverrir Agnarsson]].&lt;ref name="Eygló Svala Arnarsdóttir 2014 p. 65"&gt;Eygló Svala Arnarsdóttir, 'To a Mosque on a Magic Carpet', ''Iceland Review'', 52.1 (2014), 64--68 (p. 65).&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the association has 465 members. More than half were born in Iceland; perhaps 40-50 were born to non-Muslim parents.&lt;ref name="Eygló Svala Arnarsdóttir 2014 p. 65"/&gt;

The Muslim Association of Iceland currently runs the [[Reykjavík Mosque]], a [[Sunni]] mosque on the third floor of an office building in Ármúli 38, Reykjavík.&lt;ref name="US" /&gt; It has two [[imam]]s and offers daily and nightly prayers attended by a mix of local Icelanders and visiting Muslims. It also offers weekly Friday prayers for [[Jumu'ah]]. In 2000 the Muslim Association applied to purpose-build a mosque in Reykjavík; after a long process, permission for building was granted on July 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Kári Tulinius, 'So What Is This Reykjavík Mosque I Keep Hearing About?', ''The Reykjavík Grapevine'', 8.8.2013, http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/So-What-Is-This-Reykjavik-Mosque-I-Keep-Hearing-About.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prayers are said in Arabic, but English and Icelandic are also widely used due to the diverse nature of the congregation. The Association regularly runs courses in both Arabic and Icelandic.&lt;ref name="skemman.is"/&gt;

===Islamic Cultural Centre of Iceland===
The [[Islamic Culture Centre of Iceland]] (''Menningarsetur múslima á Íslandi'') was founded in 2008 by [[Karim Askari]], originally from Morocco, and as of 2014 has 305 members.&lt;ref name="Eygló Svala Arnarsdóttir 2014 p. 65"/&gt; The Centre hired Ahmad Seddeeq, originally from Egypt, as Imam in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Eygló Svala Arnarsdóttir, 'To a Mosque on a Magic Carpet', ''Iceland Review'', 52.1 (2014), 64--68 (p. 67).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic Cultural Centre of Iceland runs a mosque in Ýmishúsið on Skógarhlíð in Reykjavík.&lt;ref&gt;Eygló Svala Arnarsdóttir, 'To a Mosque on a Magic Carpet', ''Iceland Review'', 52.1 (2014), 64--68 (pp. 65-66).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination==
One of the main researchers on Icelandic attitudes to racial and religious groups, Kristín Loftsdóttir, has found that many Icelanders exhibit [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant]] discourses linked with Islamophobia in ways parallel those in other European countries, despite Iceland having an often completely different history of contact with Islamic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Kristín Loftsdóttir. 2012b. 'Belonging and the Icelandic Others: Situating Icelandic Identity in a Postcolonial Context', in ''Whiteness and Postcolonialism in the Nordic Region: Exceptionalism, Migrant Others and National Identities'', ed. by Kristín Loftsdóttir and Lars Jensen (Farnham: Ashgate, 2012), pp. 56-72 (p. 63).&lt;/ref&gt; Many public expressions of Islamophobia have in the second decade of the twenty-first century been focused on opposition to the creation of a purpose-built [[Reykjavík Mosque|Reykjavík mosque]]. Opposition to Islam is often presented in terms of support for gender equality, a discourse which in Kristín's assessment is 'used as a way to dwell on the criticism of Muslims in general, and to the glory of European societies'.&lt;ref&gt;Kristín Loftsdóttir. 2012a. Whiteness is from Another World: Gender, Icelandic International Development and Multiculturalism. European Journal of Women’s Studies, 19(1), 41–54 (p. 47). See also Þorgerður H. Þorvaldsdóttir, 'The Gender-Equal North: Icelandic Images of Femininity and Masculinity', in ''Iceland and Images of the North'', ed. by Sumarliði R. Ísleifsson (Québec: Presses de l'Université du Québec, 2011), pp. 405-34 (pp. 410-11).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Óttar M. Norðfjörð|Óttar M. Norðfjörð's]] 2010 novel ''[[Örvitinn eða; Hugsjónamaðurinn]]'' satirises Islamophobic attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;'Fávitinn, Ofvitinn, Örvitinn og Óttar M. Norðfjörð: Strákur Karlsson heldur út í heim', Morgunblaðið, 3 March 2010, http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/1324420/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Icelandic Muslims prefer not to join a formal organisation, considering their relationship with God a personal one.&lt;ref name="Eygló Svala Arnarsdóttir 2014 p. 66"/&gt;

The Comorians are a blend of settlers from many areas: [[Iran]]ian traders, mainland [[Africa]]ns, [[Arab]]s and [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]]. Comorian communities can also be found in other parts of the Comoros chain as well as in [[Madagascar]].

Although young people wear Western style clothing, traditional clothing is still common among adults. While in town, a Comorian man will typically wear a white cotton garment and a knee-length shirt, sometimes with a white jacket and white skull cap. Out of town, a long cloth sarong (colorful skirt) is worn. Most women wear long, colorful cotton dresses with bright shawls as face coverings. Others prefer black robes that cover their heads.

Polygamy has been an acceptable practice among the Comorians. However, on March 29, 2009, 95% of Mayotte citizens voted to become the 101st department of France. Due to the vote becoming effective in March 2011, the island is required to bar all forms of polygamous unions and other forms of practices that "contradict with French culture", including child marriages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iD6Ccua9o2lcqu_7QIPNYPDVjWzgD977TDKO1 French island of Mayotte votes to change in status]&lt;/ref&gt; At the present time, polygamous marriages are presumed to have been stopped being issued by the government.

Traditionally, the Comorians have been very resistant to any kind of religious change.&lt;ref&gt;http://kcm.co.kr/bethany_eng/p_code/1386.html&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of Islam in Mayotte has been described as tolerant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.francesoir.fr/actualite/societe/mayotte-voit-l-avenir-en-tricolore-87198.html|title=Mayotte voit l’avenir en tricolore|date=31 March 2011|publisher=France Soir|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">'''Khusrau''' (died 712) was the ruler of the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarezm]] briefly in 712. He was the relative and successor of [[Azkajwar II]].

Nothing is known about the early life of Khusrau, although he was probably a member of the Afrighid family. In 712, a anti-[[Abbasid]] rebellion broke out in Khwarazm, which resulted in the overthrow and death of king Azkajwar II, who had agreed to become a vassal of the Abbasids. Khusrau claimed the throne. However, the Abbasids invaded Khwarazm and ravaged the region, brutally massacring the rebels and burning several important objects of the Khwarazmian culture. Khusrau was killed and was replaced by Azkajwar's son [[Askajamuk II]] as the new ruler of the kingdom.

{{History of Malaysia}}

'''Setul''', officially the '''Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara''' ({{lang-ms|Kerajaan Setul Mambang Segara}}; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]:نڬري ستول ممبڠ سڬارا; {{Lang-th|เมืองสตูล}}; {{RTGS|''Muang Satun''}}&lt;ref name="DoAsia 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|DoAsia|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a traditional [[Malay people|Malay kingdom]] founded in the northern coast of [[Malay Peninsular]]. The state was established in 1808 in wake of the partition between the rulers in the [[Kedah Sultanate|Royal House of Kedah]].&lt;ref name="Ahmad Jelani Halimi &amp; Mohd Yusoff Mydin Pitchai 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Ahmad Jelani Halimi &amp; Mohd Yusoff Mydin Pitchai|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partition witnessed the territory being seceded to the [[cadet branch]] of the royal family. The sovereignty of the kingdom effectively ended in 1916, following the dissolution by the [[Thailand|Siamese]] government. Her borders was largely inherited to her successive province, the present-day [[Satun Province|Satun]], [[Thailand]].

==Etymology==
Setul derived its name from ''Buah Setul'', a local name for [[Sandoricum koetjape|Cottonfruit]] native to the area, while its honorific title - ''Mambang Segara'' is a Malay variant of the [[List of water deities|Sea Deity]], potentially tied from the ancient Malay mysticism due to its location off the western seaboard of the Malay Peninsular.&lt;ref name="Ahmad Jelani Halimi &amp; Mohd Yusoff Mydin Pitchai 2016"/&gt; The state was also colloquially referred to Setoi, a [[Kedah Malay language|Kedahan Malay]] cognate of the territory. In the [[Thai language]], the state was known as ''Satun'' ({{Lang-th|สตูล}}), the Thai pronunciation was later adopted to the present-day name of the [[Satun Province|province]].

==History==
===Origin===
[[File:Setul.jpg|thumb|left|Kedahan Royal Procession in Setul led by Tunku Abdul Aziz, 1897.]]
Once located in the heartland of [[Kedah Sultanate|Kedah Kingdom]], Setul rise to prominence following the death of [[Abdullah Mukarram Shah of Kedah|Abdullah Mukarram Shah]], the 20th [[Sultan of Kedah]] in 1797. The demise of the monarch resulted the crowning of [[Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II of Kedah|Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II]] as the new Sultan. The election was endorsed and recognised by the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] of [[Thailand|Siam]], who perceived Kedah as their [[vassal]]. The appointment however, rapidly erupted into a severe secession crisis in the Royal House after it was contested by the crown prince, Tunku Bisnu. Aiding to reconcile the two rivalling parties, the Siamese appointed Tunku Bisnu as the ruler of Setul, signifying the birth of Kedah into two separate realms.&lt;ref name="MyKedah 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|MyKedah|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunku Bisnu spends most of his reign in Kedah over [[Satun province|Setul]], with local affairs was mainly administrated by his aide, Dato' Wan Abdullah. Nonetheless, as recorded by ''Syair Sultan Maulana'', it was narrated that Tunku Bisnu was a capable ruler that led the Kedahan troops during the war against [[Konbaung Dynasty]] forces in [[Phuket|Salang]].

===Ratification===
By 1833, the royal courts of Kedah entered another crisis between Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Syah II and Tunku Embun (Tunku Yaakub), the crown price. The crisis was predominantly derived from the sultan's refusal to appoint the crown prince to be the King of Kayang (Perlis) and Setul. This resulted Tunku Embun to request military assistance from the [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Province|Governor of Ligor]] to overthrow the Kedahan government, falsely claiming that the Sultan has allied with the British.&lt;ref name="Mata Hati 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Mata Hati|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The armed conflict was known locally as ''Perang Musuh Berbisik'' (War of the whispering enemies).&lt;ref name="Isma 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Isma|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the War of 1833, the geographical location provided in Setul was used for the advantage by the Kedahan militia led by Dato Wan Mad Ali (Dato Setia Sengkara), to launch an attack against the Siamese in [[Trang Province|Terang]], [[Krabi|Ayer Kelubi]] dan [[Ko Yao Yai (island)|Pulau Panjang]]. Following the fall of Kedah, Dato Wan Mad Ali was forced to move to [[Langkawi]] along with an exodus of 100 Malay families from Setul.&lt;ref name="Ahmad Jelani Halimi &amp; Mohd Yusoff Mydin Pitchai 2016"/&gt;

The [[coup d'état]] led by Tunku Yaakob was proven to be successful, as the sultan was forced to retreat in the British-backed [[Penang]] and later exiled in [[Malacca]].&lt;ref name="Dato' Hj. Wan Shamsudin bin Mohd. Yusof 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Dato' Hj. Wan Shamsudin bin Mohd. Yusof|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Tunku Yaakob's request to be appointed as the Sultan of Kedah was refused. He and his son, Tunku Sulaiwan were later brutally executed by the order of the Siamese King after he was found guilty of spreading malicious news of the previous sultan.&lt;ref name="Mata Hati 2017"/&gt;

Following the victory, the Siamese then formed a border reformation that divide Kedah into 4 separate territories and appointing Tunku Muhammad Akib, the prince of Tunku Bisnu as the new King of Setul.&lt;ref name="Isma 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Isma|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The border reformation was parallel to the Partition of Pattani made by the Siamese earlier in 1809, the earlier partition witnessed the birth of Malay state of Pattani into 7 separate kingdoms.

The partition was ratified by 1843, when [[Zainal Rashid Al-Mu'adzam Shah I of Kedah|Zainal Rashid]], the Sultan of Kedah bought a royal entourage to the Siamese government in [[Bangkok]]. The royal entourage consist of Tunku Anum, the [[Kubang Pasu Kingdom|ruler of Kubang Pasu]]; [[House of Jamalullail (Perlis)|Syed Hussein]], the ruler of Perlis and Tunku Muhammad Akib, the ruler of Setul. They pledged their loyalty to the Siamese crown, together with a [[Bunga Mas]] as a sign of tributary from each of the respective territories. Signifying the birth of the state into four separate dominion.

Despite the fact that Kedah was officially partitioned into 4 distinct kingdoms, all of the states maintained a close economic and kinship ties. Several exemplification can be witnessed during this era, the royal marriage between Tunku Jahara, the member of Kubang Pasu Royalty with Tunku Ahmad the prince of Kedah; and in 1904, between Tunku Jura, a Kedahan princess with Syed Zahir, a royal member of the Setul Kingdom.

===Post-partition===
[[File:Kedah-Satun Nobility.jpg|thumb|left|Kedah and Setul nobility, {{circa|1900}}.]]
Tunku Ismail seceded to the throne of Setul in 1876 after the death of Tunku Muhammad Akib. The king was alleged to be an incompetent leader for the administration of the state. Internal strife in the Royal House of Setul caused a relative of Tunku Ismail, Tunku Muhammad to established a kingdom in [[La-ngu District|Langu]], north of Setul in 1882.&lt;ref name="Ahmad Jelani Halimi &amp; Mohd Yusoff Mydin Pitchai 2016"/&gt;  Both of the territories managed to be reunified afterwards after a consolidation by the Siamese government.&lt;ref name="DoAsia 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|DoAsia|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several infrastructure developments can be witnessed during the reign of Tunku Ismail, including the construction of several roads, fort, the town hall and managing the rivers in Setul. Tunku Ismail also ordered the construction of a brick prison, enlarging the court, improving the telegram network and introducing the postal service. His rule also witnessed a closer relationship with the Siamese, with the kingdom sends 260 individuals to subdue the Chinese rebellion of Phuket in 1878 together with the troops from Kedah and Perlis. He was awarded the [[Order of the White Elephant]] for his active role in aiding the Siamese during the revolt.&lt;ref name="DoAsia 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|DoAsia|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunku Abdul Rahman replaced Tunku Ismail as the king upon his death in 1888, with Tunku Muhammad appointed as the crown prince. He managed to further develop various infrastructures centred around the capital. Towards the end of his 10-year reign, he became permanently insane.&lt;ref name="Ahmad Jelani Halimi &amp; Mohd Yusoff Mydin Pitchai 2016"/&gt;

===Reformation===
[[File:Ku Din.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Tunku Baharuddin bin Ku Meh, the last King of Setul, 1902.]]
The vacant seat of the king has led Kedah to appoint Tunku Baharuddin bin Ku Meh as a Governor for the administrative works in Setul. Better known as Ku Din, he was a commander in the Alor Setar prison.&lt;ref name="Mahani Musa 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Mahani Musa|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ku Din was known to be a capable leader, nonetheless he doesn't received much approval from the general public since he is not a member of the Setul royalty.&lt;ref name="Ooi Keat Gin 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi Keat Gin|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of Ku Din as the Governor of Setul also angered Tunku Muhammad, the crown prince as he was supposed to rule the kingdom. As the crown prince doesn't received much recognition from the Royal Courts of Kedah, he tried to sought assistance in Bangkok. His efforts proved to be vain since Ku Din was far more influential compared to the crown prince. Tunku Muhammad however, was absorbed into the Satun administration after several months since the appointment of Ku Din.

Ku Din rapidly forged closer ties to the Siamese central government upon his appointment as the Governor. He began to send [[Bunga Mas]] tributaries separately from Kedah. The separate Bunga Mas caused a severe strain in the Kedah-Setul diplomatic relationship, as the possession from the state was historically sent via Kedah, since both the Siamese and Kedah perceived Setul as a Kedahan principality. The link between the two kingdoms only began to be restored after a reconciliation by Che Ampuan Manyalara, the Queen of Kedah.&lt;ref name="Ahmad Jelani Halimi &amp; Mohd Yusoff Mydin Pitchai 2016"/&gt;

Ku Din widely emulated many similar features from the Kedahan administration system, including the introduction of the Head of Education Department, Malay School Headmaster, [[Chinese Kapitan]], Royal Officer Service, Head of the Judicial Court, ''[[Qadi|Kadzi]]'', Head of Medical Department, Head of the Police Force, [[Auditor]], [[Translator]] and various other departments. He also improved the police department by recruiting 36 armed-force from [[Punjab]]. Ku Din was also known to introduce uniforms for the government servant.

Towards the end of his rule, he launched many rules and regulations that accommodate his pro-Siamese ideals. He started to introduce the [[Thai language|Siamese language]] as the language of the courts and administration, replacing [[Malay language|Malay]]. This led to the resignation of many government officials who are not familiar with the language. His pro-Siamese leadership also resulted to a resistant movement by the native Malays in the territory, although the movement was later being subdued by the Siamese government.&lt;ref name="DoAsia 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|DoAsia|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1902, he was proclaimed as the King of Setul, bearing the [[regnal name]] of Tunku Baharuddin bin Ku Meh. The proclamation was affirmed by the Governors of southern Siam and the Siamese government.

===Dissolution===
[[File:Kuden Mansion.jpg|thumb|The Kuden Mansion, historically the official residence of Tunku Baharuddin, it has since converted as the Satun National Museum.]]
In 1892, Setul was returned to Kedah.&lt;ref name="MyKedah 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|MyKedah|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Kedahan sovereignty over Setul was gradually being eroded by the Siamese. By 1902, it is evident that Ku Din holds a full-autonomous power over Setul against Kedah.

The Kedahan jurisdiction in Setul was officially ended by 1909 in wake of the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909|Anglo-Siamese Treaty]]. The British had planned for an inclusion of Setul together with Kedah and Perlis due to the strong ties between the states, but did not managed to succeeded in its claim due to the reluctance of the Siamese King.

Tengku Din was officially abdicated in its position in 1916, 6 years after the consolidation of Setul in Siam. He was awarded as "The Devoted King" by the Siamese central government for his efforts in developing Setul. He was however, perceived as a traitor in Kedah for his role in dividing the sultanate.

===Aftermath===
The Siamese decided to discontinued the Malay kingship system in Setul. The King was replaced by a Governor from [[Bangkok]], Prak Khoja Ishak. It was recorded that Setul continued to be developed under his leadership. It was during his rule that the role of Islam continued to flourish and the position of ''Khadi Besar'' (Head Khadi) was introduced, a position filled by Dato’ Yutilamdilantik.&lt;ref name="Ahmad Jelani Halimi &amp; Mohd Yusoff Mydin Pitchai 2016"/&gt;

The Prak Khoja Ishak administration marked the end of the full Malay-medium of education in the area. The education system was reformed and incorporated the [[Thai language]] as the medium of instruction. This resulted a gradual [[language shift|language]] and identity shift among the Malay community in Setul. Today, only a small percentage of [[Islam in Thailand|Thai Muslim]] in Satun that are conversant in the language, a far-cry for her historical sister states down south.&lt;ref name="Ahmad Jelani Halimi &amp; Mohd Yusoff Mydin Pitchai 2016"/&gt; Presently, the Thai government has already reintroduced [[Malay language]] lesson in the curricula in some schools in the province, an act to help preserving the culture and identity of the modern [[Thai Malays]] in Satun.

In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], '''Kondole''' was a mean and rude man.  One night, the performers during a ceremony needed someone to keep a fire going; Kondole was the only one with fire, and he hid in the bush.  The men argued with him, and one got frustrated and threw a [[spear]] into Kondole's [[human skull|skull]].  All the men then turned into [[animal]]s, including [[kangaroo]]s, [[Phalangeriformes|possums]], [[fish]] and [[bird]]s.  Kondole became a [[whale]] and the hole in his head from the spear became his [[blowhole (bio)|blowhole]]. The Kondole was the first whale according to Aboriginal myth.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

{{selfref|This article is not about the Krishna dasa Babaji of Ranabadi who died in 1865, nor the one of Navadvipa who died in 1919, nor the one of Radhakund who died in 1998.}}

'''Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja''' (18th century), often Romanized '''Krishna das Babaji''' or similar, was a [[Vaishnava]] guru from [[Govardhan Hill|Govardhana]]. His birth name is '''Batakṛṣṇa Kanango''', and he is popularly known as '''Siddha Baba of Govardhana'''.

His father was Sanatana Kanango, of [[kanana]] [[caste]]. His mother was Jari, daughter of Mangaraja. He was taught [[bhajan]] by [[Vaishnava Carana dasa Babaji]], from the lineage of [[Narottama Dasa]].

He initiated [[Jagadananda Goswami]] and [[Madhusudana dasa Babaji]]. A festival is held on 25 April to commemorate his disappearance.

[[File:WestminsterCathedralFull.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Westminster Cathedral, considered the Catholic mother church of England and Wales]]

The '''Catholic dioceses in Great Britain''' are organised by two separate hierarchies: the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]], and the [[Catholic Church in Scotland]].  Within [[Great Britain]], the Catholic Church of England and Wales has five [[ecclesiastical province|provinces]], subdivided into 22 [[diocese]]s, and the Catholic Church of Scotland has two provinces, subdivided into 8 dioceses. The Catholic dioceses in [[Northern Ireland]] are organised together with those in the [[Republic of Ireland]], as the Church in Ireland was not divided when [[Partition of Ireland|civil authority in Ireland was partitioned in the 1920s]].

A [[diocese]], also known as a bishopric, is an administrative unit under the supervision of a [[bishop]]. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster|Diocese of Westminster]] is considered the [[mother church]] of English and Welsh Catholics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbcew.org.uk/CBCEW-Home/Dioceses/Westminster|title=Westminster|publisher=The Catholic Church in England and Wales|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although not formally a [[Primate (bishop)|primate]], the [[archbishop of Westminster]] is usually elected President of the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales]] providing a degree of a formal direction for the other English bishops and archbishops.

From the time of the [[English Reformation]] in the 16th century, with Catholicism becoming illegal, there were no Catholic dioceses in England and Wales, with several [[apostolic vicariate|apostolic vicars]], bishops of titular sees governing not in their own name, as diocesan bishops do, but provisionally in the name of the [[Pope]], being appointed instead. However, with the passing of the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829]], legalising the practice of the Catholic faith again, [[Pope Pius IX]] recreated the Catholic Church diocesan hierarchy on 29 September 1850 by issuing the [[papal bull]] ''[[Universalis Ecclesiae]]''. The Hierarchy in Scotland was restored in 1878.

Three Catholic dioceses, those of Leeds, Liverpool, and Portsmouth, share their territorial name with [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[list of Church of England dioceses|dioceses]], the [[Anglican Diocese of Leeds]], the [[Anglican diocese of Liverpool]], and the [[Anglican Diocese of Portsmouth]] respectively. However, in these cases the dioceses cover differing areas.

The [[Catholic]] Church in [[Scotland]] comprises two Latin [[ecclesiastical province]]s each headed by a [[Metropolitan archbishop]]. The provinces in turn are subdivided into 6 [[diocese]]s and 2 [[archdiocese]]s, each headed by a [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] or an [[archbishop]], respectively.

There is an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to Great Britain as papal diplomatic representation (embassy-level) to the British authorities (UK)

'''The Lucis Trust''' is a nonprofit service organization incorporated in the United States in 1922 by [[Alice Bailey]] and her husband Foster Bailey, to act as a [[fiduciary trust]] for the publishing of twenty-four books of [[esoteric]] philosophy published under Alice Bailey's name, and to fund and administer activities concerned with the establishment of "right human relations".  These include the [[Arcane School]], a school for esoteric training, World Goodwill, Triangles, a lending library, ''The Beacon'' magazine, as well as the publishing company.

The objectives of the Lucis Trust as stated in its charter are: "To encourage the study of comparative religion, philosophy, science and art; to encourage every line of thought tending to the broadening of human sympathies and interests, and the expansion of ethical religious and educational literature; to assist or to engage in activities for the relief of suffering and for human betterment; and, in general, to further worthy efforts for humanitarian and educational ends."

The Lucis Trust's publishing company was founded in the early 1920s as the '''Lucifer Publishing Company'''.&lt;ref name=Lucifer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lucistrust.org/en/arcane_school/talks_and_articles/the_esoteric_meaning_of_lucifer |title=The Esoteric Meaning of Lucifer |work=Lucis Trust website |accessdate=July 24, 2014 |quote=[Alice and Foster Bailey] named their fledgling publishing company "Lucifer Publishing Company"....The Baileys' reasons for choosing the original name are not known to us, but we can only surmise that they...sought to elicit a deeper understanding of the sacrifice made by Lucifer. Alice and Foster Bailey were serious students and teachers of Theosophy, a spiritual tradition which views Lucifer as one of the solar Angels, those advanced Beings Who Theosophy says descended...to our planet eons ago to bring the principle of mind to what was then animal-man.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lucis Trust says that the name was probably chosen to honor [[Lucifer]].&lt;ref name=Lucifer/&gt; The name was changed in 1925 to the '''Lucis Publishing Company'''. In Latin ''lucem ferre'' means "to bear light" and ''lucis'' means ''of light''. The company has headquarters in New York City, London, and Geneva.

The Trust is established in Great Britain under the title "Lucis Trust Ltd.", in Switzerland as "Lucis Trust Association", and in the Netherlands as the "Lucis Trust Stichting".

The Lucis Trust runs a blog, "World Goodwill at the UN", which focuses on defining new Sustainable Development Goals for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lucistrust.org/en/service_activities/world_goodwill |title=World Goodwill |accessdate=Aug 13, 2014 |work=Lucis Trust website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lupercal'''  (from Latin ''[[wikt:lupa|lupa]]'' "female [[wolf]]") was a [[cave]] at the southwest foot of the [[Palatine Hill]] in [[Rome]], located somewhere between the temple of [[Temple of Cybele (Palatine)|Magna Mater]] and the [[Sant'Anastasia al Palatino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vuković|first1=Krešimir|title=The Topography of the Lupercalia|journal=The Papers of the British School at Rome|volume=86|pages=1–9|doi=10.1017/S0068246217000381}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the legend of the [[founding of Rome]], [[Romulus and Remus]] were found there by the [[she-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] who suckled them until they were rescued by the shepherd [[Faustulus]]. Luperci, the priests of [[Faunus]], celebrated certain ceremonies of the [[Lupercalia]] at the cave, from the earliest days of the City until at least 494 AD.

==Modern discovery==
In January 2007, Italian archaeologist [[Irene Iacopi]] announced that she had probably found the legendary cave beneath the remains of Emperor [[Augustus]]'s house, the ''Domus [[Livia]]'', on the Palatine. Archaeologists came across the 15-meter-deep cavity while working to restore the decaying palace.&lt;ref name="Valsecchi"&gt;{{cite news

On 20 November 2007, the first set of photos were released showing the vault of the grotto which is encrusted with colourful mosaics, pumice stones and seashells. The center of the ceiling features a depiction of a white eagle, the symbol of the Roman Empire. Archaeologists are still searching for the entrance of the grotto.&lt;ref name="Jaggard"&gt;{{cite news

Its location below Augustus' residence is thought to be significant; Octavian, before he became [[Augustus]], had considered taking the name [[Romulus]] to indicate that he intended to found Rome anew.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 22 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, Vita Divi Augusti, I.7&lt;/ref&gt;

They concluded that the grotto is actually a [[nymphaeum]] or underground [[triclinium]] from [[Nero]]nian times.

A '''muhtasibat''' ({{lang-ru|Мухтасибат}})is an Islamic territorial division of a [[muhtasib]] and is directly subordinate to a [[qadi]] and [[qadiyat]].  A muhtasib oversees a muhtasibat.  &lt;ref&gt;Muslim communities and Islamic network institutions in Ukraine https://www.academia.edu/1206999/Muslim_communities_and_Islamic_network_institutions_in_Ukraine_contesting_authorities_in_shaping_of_Islamic_localities&lt;/ref&gt;   

As [[Sunni Islam]] does not prescribe any formal hierarchy or priesthood, muhtasibats are primarily found in Eastern European and Central Asian Islamic organizations, particularly in countries derived from the former Soviet Union.  &lt;ref&gt; Russian_Nationalism : Message: Bulletin 4:16 - Special Issue: SOVA https://groups.yahoo.com/group/russian_nationalism/message/790&lt;/ref&gt;  

Originally, a muhtasib was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] official charged with supervising proper weights and measures in markets as well as the proper conduct of certain rituals. &lt;ref&gt;History of civilizations of Central Asia, v. 5 http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001302/130205e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, a muhtasibat is a territory containing several [[mahalla]]s or congregations.&lt;ref&gt;IslamRF.ru: Religious Board of Muslims for the Nizhny Novgorod http://islamrf.ru/eng/news/eheritage/emuslims/6606/&lt;/ref&gt; Religious institutions and Islamic parochial schools fall directly under the supervision of muhtasibats.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamrf.ru/eng/news/eheritage/emuslims/6606&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership''' (CLAL) is a leadership training institute, think tank, and resource center. It is an inter-disciplinary and inter-denominational movement, in which rabbis from all of the major [[Jewish denominations]] in North America are participants. The organisation is described by ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' as a "think-tank dedicated to questions of [[Jewish identity]] and religious practice...in its quest to expand the boundaries of Jewish communal life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-07-30|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/7159/|title=‘Rabbi Cool’ and Rock Opera Draw Stars, Upscale Spiritualists|publisher=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbis [[Irwin Kula]] and [[Brad Hirschfield]] presently serve as co-presidents of CLAL.&lt;ref name="Newsweek2009"&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2009/04/03/50-influential-rabbis.html "50 Influential Rabbis"], ''[[Newsweek]]'', April 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clal.org/cms/node/43 "CLAL Faculty, Fellows and Associates"] at CLAL website (accessed June 18, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
CLAL is an acronym formed from the organization's English language name (Center for Leadership and Learning).  It is also a [[transliteration]] of a Hebrew word that can mean community, as in the expressions "Klal Yisrael" which refers to the Jewish people as a whole.  It is intended to suggest the organization's stated mission to serve as a center of interdenominational cooperation in American Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kabbalah-based course offers steps to fulfillment|url=https://www.jlicentral.com/news.php?task=fullstory&amp;NID=114|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CLAL was founded in 1974, by Rabbi [[Irving Greenberg]], Nobel Laureate [[Elie Wiesel]], and [http://rabbiirvinggreenberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CLAL-News-and-Perspective_New-Era_red.pdf Rabbi Steven Shaw].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5440">During the [[recovery of Orthodox Churches in the Second Polish Republic]], a large number of Orthodox churches were demolished for a variety of reasons including:

* to reduce the influence of the [[Polish Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] in Poland because it was seen as a representative of [[Russian Empire|Russian]] power
* to reverse the [[Russification#Poland and Lithuania|Russification]] that had been carried out after the [[November Uprising]] (1830-1831)
* active [[Polonization#Second Polish Republic (1918–1939)|Polonization]] of areas with Orthodox populations
* to remove derelict buildings for safety reasons after they were abandoned or didn't have enough faithful to provide for their upkeep

'''''Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences''''' is a 1964 book about [[psychology]] by [[Abraham Maslow]]. Maslow addressed the motivational significance of peak experiences in a series of lectures in the early 1960s, later published these ideas in book form.&lt;ref&gt;Koltko-Rivera, Mark E. "Rediscovering the later version of Maslow's hierarchy of needs: Self-transcendence and opportunities for theory, research, and unification." ''Review of General Psychology'' 10, no. 4 (2006): 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with the preoccupation of Freudian psychopathology, Maslow insisted on a "psychology of the higher life" which was to attend to the question "of what the human being should grow toward."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Dennis, and Leodones Yballe. "Maslow revisited: Constructing a road map of human nature." ''Journal of Management Education'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Maslow described the experience of one's life as meaningful as being based on a feeling of fulfillment and significance.&lt;ref&gt;Battista, John, and Richard Almond. "The development of meaning in life." ''Psychiatry'' 36, no. 4 (1973): 409-427.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maslow's theory of “peak-experiences” has been compared to [[William James]]' “healthy-minded” religion.&lt;ref&gt;Burris, Christopher T., and W. Ryan Tarpley. "Religion as being: Preliminary validation of the Immanence scale." ''Journal of Research in Personality'' 32, no. 1 (1998): 55-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Maslow hypothesized a negative relationship between adherence to conventional religious beliefs and the ability to experience peak moments.&lt;ref&gt;Breed, George, and Joen Fagan. "Religious dogmatism and peak experiences: A test of Maslow's hypothesis." ''Psychological Reports'' 31, no. 3 (1972): 866-866.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences'', Maslow stated that the peak experience is "felt as a self- validating, self-justifying moment which carries its own intrinsic value with it." Furthermore, the person is the "creative center of his (or her) own activities."&lt;ref&gt;Yeagle, Ellen H., Gayle Privette, and Frances Y. Dunham. "HIGHEST HAPPINESS: AN ANALYSIS OF ARTISTS'PEAK EXPERIENCE." ''Psychological Reports'' 65, no. 2 (1989): 523-530.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19177">'''Religious response to assisted reproductive technology (ART)''' deals with the new challenges for traditional social and religious communities raised by modern [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART). Because many religious communities have strong opinions and religious legislation regarding marriage, sex and reproduction, modern fertility technology has forced religions to respond.

==Sperm collection==
{{See also|Religious views on masturbation}}
Both for male factor testing and in order to use [[sperm]] for [[IUI]] or [[IVF]] the couple must first collect a [[sperm sample]]. For many religious groups this creates a challenge due to a prohibition on [[masturbation]].

==Christianity==

===Catholicism===
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] opposes all kinds of ART and artificial [[contraception]] since they separate the procreative goal of [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church#Matrimony|marital]] sex from the goal of uniting married couples. 
The Roman Catholic Church permits the use of a small number of reproductive technologies and contraceptive methods like [[natural family planning]], which involves charting [[ovulation]] times. The church allows other forms of reproductive technologies that allow conception to take place from normative [[sexual intercourse]], such as a fertility lubricant.

====In vitro fertilization====
[[Pope Benedict XVI]] has publicly re-emphasized the Catholic Church's opposition to [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF), claiming it replaces love between a husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Medical news today | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/38686.php | title = Pope Benedict XVI Declares Embryos Developed For In Vitro Fertilization Have Right To Life | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081229164506/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/38686.php | archivedate = 2008-12-29 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the church opposes IVF because it might cause disposal of embryos; Catholics believe an embryo is an individual with a [[soul]] who must be treated as a such.&lt;ref name=medill /&gt;

{{Quote |&lt;p&gt;This [[Natural law#Contemporary Christian understanding|particular doctrine]], often expounded by the [[Magisterium|magisterium of the Church]], is based on the inseparable connection, established by God, which man on his own initiative may not break, between the unitive significance and the procreative significance which are both inherent to the marriage act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that the fundamental nature of the marriage act, while uniting husband and wife in the closest intimacy, also renders them capable of generating new life—and this as a result of laws written into the actual nature of man and of woman. And if each of these essential qualities, the unitive and the procreative, is preserved, the use of marriage fully retains its sense of true mutual love and its ordination to the supreme responsibility of parenthood to which man is called. We believe that our contemporaries are particularly capable of seeing that this teaching is in harmony with human reason.&lt;ref name="humanae_vitae"&gt;{{cite web | location = Rome | url = http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html | title = Humanae Vitae: Encyclical of Pope Paul VI on the Regulation of Birth, sec 12| author = Pope Paul VI | authorlink = Pope Paul VI|date= 25 July 1968|accessdate= 25 November 2008|publisher = Vatican}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;}}

According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]],
{{Quote |Techniques involving only the married couple (homologous artificial insemination and fertilization) are perhaps less reprehensible, yet remain morally unacceptable.  They dissociate the sexual act from the procreative act.  The act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, but one that "entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children."&lt;ref name = "catechism"&gt;{{cite web| title = Catechism of the Catholic Church. Section 2377| url = http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P86.HTM |accessdate=25 November 2008|publisher = Vatican |year= 1993 | location = Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Catholic Church maintains that it is not objectively evil to be infertile, and advocates adoption as an option for such couples who still wish to have children:
{{Quote |The [[Gospel]] shows that physical sterility is not an absolute evil. Spouses who still suffer from infertility after exhausting legitimate medical procedures should unite themselves with the [[Christian cross|Lord's Cross]], the source of all spiritual fecundity. They can give expression to their generosity by adopting abandoned children or performing demanding services for others.&lt;ref name="catechism" /&gt;}}

The Catholic Church nevertheless is concerned with it because "Some theologians consider this to be a replacement of the marital act, and therefore immoral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/prolife/programs/rlp/98rlphaa.shtml |title=Begotten Not Made: A Catholic View of Reproductive Technology |last=Haas |first=John M |work=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210153922/http://www.usccb.org/prolife/programs/rlp/98rlphaa.shtml |archivedate=February 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LDS Church ===
The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] "strongly discourages the donation of sperm" and likewise strongly discourages in vitro fertilization "using semen from anyone but the husband or an egg from anyone but the wife". However, official church policy also notes that such decisions are personal matters and, as such, "must be left to the judgment of the husband and wife". No disciplinary action is advised for LDS married couples who make use of such in vitro fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/selected-church-policies/21.4?lang=eng#21.4.7 Handbook 2: Administering the Church, section 21.4 Policies on Moral Issues], accessed 02 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protestantism ===
Some of the more liberal Protestant denominations support ART.  Many Evangelicals, however, especially Calvinists, position themselves similarly to Catholics. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Hinduism==
There are several [[Hindu|Hindus]] who have been claimed to be born without intercourse including [[Karna]] &amp; Five [[Pandava|Pandavas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Science in hinduism-Test tube babies | url = http://www.mallstuffs.com/Blogs/BlogDetails.aspx?BlogId=333&amp;BlogType=Spiritual&amp;Topic=Science%20in%20hinduism-Test%20tube%20babies |accessdate=30 May 2016|publisher =  |year= Oct 20, 2013 | location = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
The Islamic community, after the [[fatwa]] on [[Assisted reproductive technology|ART]] by Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak of Egypt's [[Al-Azhar University]], largely accepted ART.{{Sfn | Inhorn | 2006}}

IVF and similar technologies are permissible as long as they do not involve any form of third-party donation (of sperm, eggs, embryos, or uteruses). Regarding third-party donation there is a debate between the [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] streams of Islam. The Sunni community, following the Al-Azhar fatwa, does not allow third-party donations. In 1999, [[Ayatollah Khamenei]], the authority for the Shi'a Muslims, issued a fatwa stating that it was permitted to use third-party donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = My virtual paper | url = http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/Conceive-Magazine/Winter-2008/2008120301/59.html | title = Faith &amp; Fertility | first = Jan | last = Goodwin | journal = Conceive | date = Winter 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090621054742/http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/Conceive-Magazine/Winter-2008/2008120301/59.html | archivedate = 2009-06-21 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conclusions of Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak's ART fatwa are as follows:{{Sfn | Inhorn | 2006}}
# Artificial insemination with the husband’s semen is allowed, and the resulting child is the legal offspring of the couple.
#[[In vitro fertilization]] (IVF) of an egg from the wife with the sperm of her husband and the transfer of the fertilized egg back to the uterus of the wife is allowed, provided that the procedure is indicated for a medical reason and is carried out by an expert physician.
#Since marriage is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, whether he or she is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to ''zina'', or [[adultery]].
#Adoption of a child from an illegitimate form of medically assisted conception is not allowed. The child who results from a forbidden method belongs to the mother who delivered him/her. He or she is considered to be a ''laqid'', or an [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate child]].
#If the marriage contract has come to an end because of divorce or death of the husband, medically assisted conception cannot be performed on the ex-wife even if the sperm comes from the former husband.
#An excess number of embryos can be preserved by [[cryopreservation]]. The frozen embryos are the property of the couple alone and may be transferred to the same wife in a successive cycle, but only during the duration of the marriage contract. [[Embryo donation]] is prohibited.&lt;ref name=medill/&gt;
#[[Selective reduction]]) is only allowed if the prospect of carrying the pregnancy to viability is very small. It is also allowed if the health or life of the mother is in jeopardy.
#All forms of surrogacy are forbidden.
#Establishment of sperm banks with "selective" semen threatens the existence of the family and the "race" and should be prevented.
#The physician is the only qualified person to practice medically assisted conception in all its permitted varieties. If he performs any of the forbidden techniques, he is guilty, his earnings are forbidden, and he must be stopped from his morally illicit practice.

==Judaism==

Defining Jewish views on assisted reproductive technology based solely on branches of [[Judaism]] is problematic since there is substantial overlap in opinions and [[moral authority]].&lt;ref name=medill&gt;[http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=136743 Reconciling religion and infertility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104194217/http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=136743 |date=2013-11-04 }} By Alina Dain. July 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodox Judaism===
Within the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community the concept is debated as there is little precedent in traditional Jewish legal textual sources. Non-legal sources such as [[medrash]] and [[aggadah]] provide stories that have been used to draw conclusions regarding ART by modern Jewish [[Posek|legal decisors]]. In general, traditional Judaism views medical intervention positively.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]], Yoreh Deah 336: 1&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding ART, the positive view of medicine is challenged by the Jewish religious legal system which has numerous laws regarding modesty and sexuality and a strong emphasis on verifiable lineage.

In Orthodox Judaism, insemination with the husband’s sperm is permissible if the wife cannot become pregnant in any other way.&lt;ref name=medill/&gt;

Regarding [[Judaism and sexuality|laws of sexuality]], religious challenges include [[masturbation]] (which may be regarded as “seed wasting”&lt;ref name=medill/&gt;), laws related to sexual activity and menstruation ([[niddah]]) and the specific laws regarding intercourse. Additional issues arise regarding the restrictions of the Sabbath ([[Shabbat]]) and [[Jewish holidays]].

An additional major issue is that of establishing paternity and lineage. For a baby conceived naturally, the father’s identity is determined by a legal presumption ([[chazakah]]) of legitimacy: ''rov bi'ot achar ha'baal'' - a woman's [[Human sexual behavior|sexual relations]] are assumed to be with her husband. Regarding an IVF child, this assumption does not exist and as such Rabbi [[Eliezer Waldenberg]] (among others) requires an outside supervisor to positively identify the father.&lt;ref&gt;Tzitz Eliezer 9 p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors or laboratory workers present at the time of the fertility treatment are not considered supervisors due to a [[conflict of interest]] and their pre-occupation with their work.&lt;ref&gt;Rav [[Yosef Sholom Eliashiv|Sholom Eliashiv]]: “Even if I were to be the lab worker I couldn’t be a valid witness for this matter”.&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, supervisory services are required for all treatments involving lab manipulation or [[cryopreservation]] of sperm, ovum or embryos.

While a range of views exist, both [[egg donation]] and [[surrogacy]] are permitted according to many Orthodox decisors, pending [[Puah Institute#Supervision Services|religious fertility supervision]].&lt;ref name=medill/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/1,7340,L-3721194,00.html Haredi widow to become surrogate mother.] Nissan Shtrauchler, Yediot Acharonot&lt;/ref&gt; (In Israel, the "[[Surrogacy laws by country#Israel|Embryo Carrying Agreements Law]]" was formulated to ensure that surrogacy agreements between Jewish Israelis do not conflict with [[halacha|Jewish laws]] concerning incest and adultery and that the child born of the arrangement will be recognized as a Jew.)&lt;ref&gt;Teman, Elly. 2010. [http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/11401.php Birthing a Mother: the Surrogate Body and the Pregnant Self.] Berkeley: University of California Press. See also Kahn, Susan Martha. 2000. Reproducing Jews: A Cultural Account of Assisted Conception in Israel. Durham: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those interested are recommended to contact their local Orthodox or Hasidic Rabbi, as these laws are obviously complicated, and as is customary.

===Conservative Judaism===

The official [[halachic]] legal authority for American [[Conservative Judaism]] is the [http://Rabbinical%20Assembly Rabbinical Assembly's]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]]. They vote on proposed responsa. A responsa may be approved by either a majority or a minority vote, and individual Rabbis may rely on even minority-approved responsa for their rulings.

Artificial insemination: AI is permitted whether the donor is the husband of the woman to be impregnated or not, although it is preferable to use the husband's sperm whenever possible. The sperm donor is considered the father for purposes of determining the child's tribal status and for issues of ritual consanguinity, therefore, the use of anonymous donors is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref name="DorffTeshuva"&gt;Dorff, Rabbi Elliott. "[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19912000/dorff_artificial.pdf?phpMyAdmin=G0Is7ZE%2CH7O%2Ct%2CZ1sDHpI8UAVD6 Artificial Insemination, Egg Donation, and Adoption]," Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly. Approved 20 in favor, 1 abstention, in 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Egg donation/Surrogacy: Surrogacy and egg donation are permissible and the birth mother, rather than the genetic mother, is considered the mother of the child, therefore conversion may be necessary if a non-Jewish woman acts as a gestational surrogate. A maximum of 3 embryos may be implanted at a time. Freezing and donation of embryos is permitted.&lt;ref name="DorffTeshuva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacklerTeshuva"&gt;Mackler, Rabbi Aaron L. "[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19912000/mackler_ivf.pdf?phpMyAdmin=G0Is7ZE%2CH7O%2Ct%2CZ1sDHpI8UAVD6 In Vitro Fertilization]," Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly. Approved 20 in favor, 1 abstention, in 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative movement's position on "family purity" practices, reducing the amount of time after a woman's period during which she is prohibited to have sex, may also work as a pro-fertility measure. As part of its treatment of [[Niddah|Tohorat HaMishpahah]], the Conservative Assembly in 2006 accepted a position of eliminating the requirement for seven white days after the cessation of menses and establishing this as an optional custom. This is offered as a solution for women dealing with ovulation before mikvah by reducing the number of days with sexual relations being forbidden from an average of 12 to 5.&lt;ref name="Grossman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Susan|date=September 13, 2006|title=Mikveh And The Sanctity Of Being Created Human|url=https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/20052010/grossman_niddah.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mid-cycle staining during ovulation, while ordinarily would prevent sexual relations by being considered ''[[zavah]]'', is to be considered a result of ancillary circumstances (diet, medical treatment, physical exertion, or illness) and as such the emission is considered permissible, and the woman would not become a zavah.&lt;ref name="Grossman" /&gt; Drug therapies to avoid mid-cycle staining are deemed unnecessary with the risks of the drug side-effects outweighing the prohibition of zavah due to the commandment of ''hai bahem'', ("[you shall] live by them").&lt;ref name="Grossman" /&gt;

===Other movements===
[[Reform Judaism]] has generally approved [[artificial insemination by donor]], [[in-vitro fertilization]] and [[surrogate pregnancy|surrogate]] motherhood.&lt;ref name=medill/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6897">'''Rethinking Religion in India''' forms a five-year international conference cluster. It is jointly organised by the [http://www.cultuurwetenschap.be/ Research Centre Vergelijkende Cultuurwetenschap] ([[Ghent University]], Belgium), the [[Centre for the Study of Local Cultures]] ([[Kuvempu University]], India) and the [[Karnataka Academy of Social Sciences and Humanities]] (KASSH).

==Objectives==
[[India]] is home to hundreds of different traditions and virtually all the religions of the contemporary world. The interaction and dialogue among them has produced highly creative cultural forms and ways of living together. Yet, increasingly, scholars have begun to feel that the current knowledge about the Indian culture and its traditions is unsatisfactory at best or erroneous at worst. In the current theoretical paradigm, Indian traditions are conceived of in terms of their respective beliefs, doctrines, holy texts, religious strife, etc. This does not appear to allow for an adequate understanding of the Indian traditions. Not only does this framework determine our understanding of the religions in India, but it also has consequences for the Indians, experiencing their own traditions.

In the domain of religious studies, in postcolonial studies and in the field of comparative science of cultures, scholars have begun to argue that the questions and conceptual framework for the study of India and its religions are firmly embedded within the Western cultural history, namely within the theological framework of Christianity. Therefore, Rethinking Religion in India aims at interrogating the newly emerging attempts to study the religions and traditions of India differently.

During the first conference year the central questions that were explored are the following: Are there religions in India? Is it possible to say that the descriptions of Indian culture and its religions are the products of the Western experience of India? These questions will be explored in different formats in the three modules: (1) In the Platform sessions the different theoretical approaches to the study of religion in India will be discussed. (2) The Roundtable sessions will take up the debate about the construction of Hinduism and investigate the impact of colonialism on our understanding of India. (3) The Parallel Paper sessions will prepare the ground for Platform and Roundtable sessions of the following years. They take up the following themes: Evolutionary explanations of religion; Indians are Aryans, so what?; The caste system and Indian religion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cultuurwetenschap.be/conferences/RRI/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference format==
The 5-year conference cluster Rethinking Religion in India forms an integrated whole, with each conference building on the previous one. Each year the issues and problems to be addressed will get delineated more sharply. In between conferences, intermediary activities are planned, which will feed into the formulation of the subsequent conference themes and questions.

To achieve the overall objective of developing a new paradigm for the study of religion in India, a conference format with distinct conference modules and recurring conference themes will be adopted. Each module will approach the ten themes and questions from different angles: (1) Platform sessions; (2) Roundtable sessions; (3) Parallel Paper sessions; (4) "How to...?" workshops.

'''Platform''': Each year, there will be three plenary Platform sessions. These address one particular theme from Rethinking Religion in India. In the Rethinking Religion in India II, the Platform Sessions will consist of a one-on-one debate between representatives of these two positions. Both participants will have the opportunity to select a fellow advocate of their position, who can be requested to take over the task of developing a particular argument or countering an argument of the opponent, in the midst of the debate. The debate will be held according to the principles of reasonable discussion or rational dialogue. These have been conveniently summarised in the “ten commandments” of reasonable discussion by the pragma-dialectical school of argumentation theory.&lt;ref&gt;F. van Eemeren et al. Fundamentals of Argumentation Theory: A Handbook of Historical Backgrounds and Contemporary Developments (New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1996), 283-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roundtable''': The Roundtable participants will consist of two groups: (1) an expert group of representatives from the opposing sides of a controversial debate in the religious studies will defend their respective standpoints in the form of a short presentation. (2) A group of respondents will challenge these different positions. The aim of the Roundtable is to generate fresh and novel questions. The main part of the session will be dedicated to discussions among the participants of the Roundtable, but there will be sufficient room for questions and reactions from the audience.

'''Parallel Papers''': The Parallel Paper sessions provide young and promising Indian and international scholars a place to actively participate in the conference, and to present and discuss innovative research results. The number of parallel paper sessions has been kept limited so as to ensure the possibility of focused and qualitative discussions. They also intend to foster the academic study of religion in Indian contexts.

The Parallel Paper sessions form an integrated whole with the Platform and Roundtable sessions and a cross-fertilisation between the different modules will take place: On the one hand, these sessions prepare the grounds for the Platform and Roundtable sessions of the subsequent year. On the other hand, they also provide a space to continue the discussions of the previous year and of the intermediary activities.

==The colonial construction of Hinduism==

This edited volume crystallises the ideas generated during the inaugural conference of the five-year conference cluster Rethinking Religion in India (New Delhi, 2008): Esther Bloch, Marianne Keppens and Rajaram Hegde (eds.), [http://www.routledge.com/books/Rethinking-Religion-in-India-ISBN 978-0-415-54890-8 Rethinking Religion in India: the colonial construction of Hinduism] (London: Routledge, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-415-54890-8}}

The book critically engages with recent debates about the construction of Hinduism. Contributors are [[S.N. Balagangadhara]], Sarah Claerhout, Jakob De Roover, Timothy Fitzgerald, Richard King, [[David Lorenzen|David N. Lorenzen]], Geoffrey A. Oddie, Laurie L. Patton, Sharada Sugirtharajah, and John Zavos.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Bloch, Marianne Keppens and Rajaram Hegde (eds.), Rethinking Religion in India: the colonial construction of Hinduism (London: Routledge, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

His real name was Rustam, but was known as Dushmanziyar, which is the [[Daylami language|Daylami]] version of the Persian word ''Dushmanzar'' ("he who brings grief to his enemy").

== Biography ==
Rustam was the brother of the wife of the [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid]] ruler [[Fakhr al-Dawla]], [[Sayyida Shirin]],{{sfn|Huart|1993|p=667-668}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=244}} who was sister, or most likely, the niece of the [[Bavand dynasty|Bavandid]] ruler [[al-Marzuban]].{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=217}} Rustam also had a son named [[Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar]], who would later establish the [[Kakuyid dynasty]] of [[Isfahan]].

Rustam, because of his great service to Fakhr al-Dawla, was rewarded with land in [[Alborz]] in appreciation of his services. His duty was to protect [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and northern [[Jibal]] against the local leaders from [[Tabaristan]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|p=773-774}} Rustam later died at an unknown date before 1007, which was the date Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar established the Kakuyid dynasty.

A '''Standing Baba''', or '''Khareshwari''', is a [[Hindu]] who has vowed to stand, not sitting or lying down even to sleep. The vow is a form of Hindu [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapa (or Tapasas)]], a self-inflicted corporal punishment intended to help bring spiritual enlightenment. Khareshwari are primarily found in [[India]], but are not limited to that country.

The length of the vow is unclear from available references. One source says that the vow lasts for twelve years. Other sources do not attach a specific time frame. 

Khareshwari traditionally stood under a tree. This may be connected to the Yoga position known as Vrikasana, the Tree Position. A seventeenth-century engraving shows some images of what may be Standing Baba.

More recently Khareshwari seem to stand inside. Author [[Gregory David Roberts]] places Babas inside in his description of Khareshwari in the novel [[Shantaram_(novel)|Shantaram]]. Additionally, two online photos of Khareshwari both show men inside, not under a tree. 

The Standing Baba have a swing-like device that allows them to rest their arms during the day. During the night, a Khareshwari will support his torso on the swing as he sleeps. The swing usually has a sling beneath it. The sling can hold one of the Khareshwari's legs at a time. It is unclear if this is intended to rest one leg or to increase the pressure on the other leg. While Khareshwaris may walk about, they usually just stand/hang in their swing. 

Standing for years at a time causes swollen legs and ulcerated feet. Roberts and others describe the Khareshwari tapa as extremely painful and even permanently disabling.

'''Taoist Art''' relates to the [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophy and narratives of Lao-tzu that promote "living simply and honestly and in harmony with nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Taoism|title=Definition of TAOISM|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
The philosophy of Taoism traces back to the late [[Bronze Age]] (third - fifth centuries B.C.), and later developed into a set of religious practices. Currently Taoism is considered a "living religion, practiced in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and many overseas Chinese communities, and one that is undergoing a major revival in mainland Chinas today.” p.&amp;nbsp;13 &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44117921|title=Taoism and the arts of China|last=1954-|first=Little, Stephen,|date=2000|publisher=Art Institute of Chicago|others=Eichman, Shawn.|isbn=9780520227842|edition=1st|location=Chicago|oclc=44117921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520227859|title=Out Of Print : Taoism and the Arts of China : Stephen Little - University of California Press|website=www.ucpress.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition called ''[http://www.artic.edu/taoism/menu.php Taoism and the Arts of China]'', presented at [[Art Institute of Chicago|The Chicago Institute of Art]] (2000) emphasized the art of the late [[Han dynasty|Han]] to [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties and followed "the transformations of Taoism into an organized religion, the Taoist pantheon of gods who inhabit the stars and the heavens, modes of ritual and visualization, the cult of the immortals, and the role of landscape as a symbol of cosmic structure and process.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He has been conducted meditation retreats for thousands of inmates in several Rehabilitation Facilities and Correctional Facilities in South Vietnam, such as Tan Hiep (1200 inmates), Chanh Phu Hoa (1000 inmates), Phu Nghia (400 inmates) and Ba Ria Vung Tau (800 inmates).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giaodiemonline.com/noidung_detail.php?newsid=2424 Hướng dẫn Phật pháp cho phạm nhân]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5 and April 23, 2007, a total of 1850 “long-term” inmates of K.20 Prison, a security jail in Ben Tre Province, and on May 1, 2010 a total of 5500 inmates of Son Phu 4, Thai Nguyen city, under his guidance, have observed vegetarianism and mindfulness practice as a path to inner freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giaodiemonline.com/noidung_detail.php?newsid=2424 Đến trại giam chia sẻ yêu thương với phạm nhân ], Theo Giao Điểm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://giacngo.vn/xahoi/2008/06/04/52D653/ Thích Nhật Từ thuyết pháp và hướng dẫn thiền cho phạm nhân]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Buddhist Youth Club==
He took part in the foundation of The Buddhist Youth Club in 2006. He promoted the youth activities in South Vietnam in 2010 in which there were 4,000 young Buddhists from 24 cities and provinces to participate in the Buddhist Summer Camp in Dai Nam Theme Park, Binh Duong Province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkt.vn/hoang-phap-tre/tin-tuc-hoat-dong/3559-Dai-Nam-Noi-to-chuc-Hoi-Trai-He-2010.html Buddhist Youth Camp in Binh Duong organised by Thich Nhat Tu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays his model of Buddhist Youth Club has been applied by many provincial Buddhist Sanghas to propagate Buddhism and organise retreats for lay followers, as well as giving exam consultation every year.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoalinhthoai.com/news/detail/news-2850/Khoi-dong-chuong-trinh-Hoi-Trai-mua-he-Ly-Cong-Uan-2010.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daophatngaynay.com/vn/tin-tuc/trong-nuoc/4613-hoi-trai-ly-cong-uan-chinh-thuc-be-mac-trong-thanh-cong-tot-dep.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Dhamma Door==
In hundreds of his Dharma talks, Ven. Thich Nhat Tu urges monks, nuns, and lay people to practice the original teachings of the Buddha, in which The Four Noble Truths (sufferings, origin of sufferings, cessation of sufferings, and path leading to cessation of sufferings) and The Noble Eightfold Paths are the central doctrine of all Buddhist traditions, a conceptual framework for all of Buddhist thoughts,  instead of being influenced by the Chinese Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tusachphathoc.com/media/phap-thoai-chu-de/bat-chanh-dao.html Thich Nhat Tu on Eightfold Path]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ven Thich Nhat Tu, there is no such of 84,000 Dharma doors as stated by Chinese schools. In original Buddhism, there is no second Dharma door except threefold learning Discipline, Meditation, and Wisdom. Chinese Dharmas only focus on a few sutras, and tend to ignore all other teachings of the Buddha, as a consequence it is not comprehensive enough to help people cure sufferings completely. To him, 10 Dhamma Doors of China, 14 Dhamma Doors of Japan, and 4 of Tibet are only two parts of The Noble Eightfold Paths which are Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. Dharma doors propagators have ignored Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, and Right Effort. That is why none of the Dharma Doors is comprehensive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tusachphathoc.com/media/phap-thoai-chu-de/dan-nhap-triet-hoc-phat-giao.html Thich Nhat Tu on Buddha's philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

He urges Vietnamese Buddhist monks, nuns and lay followers to come back to the traditional Buddhism, maintain and propagate Vietnamese Buddhist culture in Vietnam, not to let it be influenced by Chinese traditions which have rooted in Vietnam in the past 2,000 years. He calls for a traditional Vietnamese chanting and writing. In Vietnam, all should be chanted and written in Vietnamese language so that everyone understands and follows the Buddha’s teaching appropriately, as the full transition of Chinese tradition has deteriorated the initiatives and growth of Vietnamese Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daophatngaynay.com/vn/tag/Sach-cua-thay-Thich-Nhat-Tu Vietnamese Books on Buddhism indicating Thich Nhat Tu's view on Dharma Doors]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations Day of Vesak 2008 and 2014 in Vietnam==
The greatest contribution of Ven. Thich Nhat Tu to the public relation of Vietnam Buddhist Sangha is successfully calling for the celebration of UN Day of Vesak (UNDV)&lt;ref&gt;[http://tuoitre.vn/Van-hoa-Giai-tri/257542/dai-le-phat-dan-lien-hop-quoc-2008-khai-mac-tai-ha-noi.html ], theo Tuổi Trẻ&lt;/ref&gt; ([[United Nations Day of Vesak]] 2008) 2008 and 2014 in Vietnam. As the Deputy Secretary of International Organising Committee (IOC) of United Nations Day of Vesak in Bangkok, he drafted Charter of UNDV, and introduced Prof. Dr. Le Manh That to IOC of UNDV. As a result, in late 2007, Prof.Dr Le Manh That was appointed by IOC as Chairman and Ven. Thich Nhat Tu as Secretary General of UNDV in 2008, hosted by the Government of Vietnam at National Conference Center, Hanoi, Vietnam.

UNDV 2008 has attracted 550 Buddhist leaders and representatives from 78 countries to attend, while UNDV 2014 attended by 1100 international participants from 95 countries. In 2008, it was one of the 10 biggest events of the country, also a historical record in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vtc.vn/345-179983/xa-hoi/chinh-tri/khai-mac-trong-the-dai-le-phat-dan-lien-hop-quoc-2008.htm UN Vesak Celebrations 2008 in Vietnam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sggp.org.vn/SGGP12h/2007/11/130002/ Tin tức tương tự], theo Sài Gòn Giải Phóng&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vov.vn/Tags/%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i-l%E1%BB%85-Ph%E1%BA%ADt-%C4%91%E1%BA%A3n-Li%C3%AAn-h%E1%BB%A3p-qu%E1%BB%91c.vov Tin tức vế Đại lễ Phật đản LHQ 2008], theo Đài tiếng nói Việt Nam&lt;/ref&gt;

UNDV in 2008 and 2014 proved an amazing spectacle of religious and spiritual festivity, with thousands of Buddhists from the world to spread Buddha's message of peace, love and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phattuvietnam.net/tintuc/4783-%C4%91%E1%BA%A1i-l%E1%BB%85-ph%E1%BA%ADt-%C4%91%E1%BA%A3n-li%C3%AAn-h%E1%BB%A3p-qu%E1%BB%91c-2008-%C4%91%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3c-b%E1%BA%A7u-ch%E1%BB%8Dn-l%C3%A0-1-trong-10-s%E1%BB%B1-ki%E1%BB%87n-n%E1%BB%95i-b%E1%BA%ADt-n%C4%83m-2008.html Đại lễ Phật đản LHQ 2008], theo Phật tử Việt Nam&lt;/ref&gt;

He successfully called for the celebration of World Buddhist Summit in Vietnam in 2010, in the Millennial Anniversary of Hanoi. Unfortunately, it was cancelled due to conflicted views between VN Buddhist Sangha and World Buddhist Summit Organisation. It is believed that Thich Nhat Tu is of Vietnamese Monks who has been able to being a bridge between National Vietnam Buddhist Sangha and international Sanghas. Thanks to that VN Buddhist Sangha has gained its reputation internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daophatngaynay.com/vn/tin-tuc/quoc-te/13524-hong-kong-lien-minh-the-gioi-ve-giao-luu-van-hoa-phat-giao-ra-doi.html Sự thành lập Liên minh thế giới về giao lưu văn hóa Phật giáo], theo Đạo Phật Ngày Nay&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://giaohoiphatgiaovietnam.vn/s7/d215/Hong-Kong--Lien-Minh-The-Gioi-Ve-Giao-Luu-Van-Hoa-Phat-Giao-ra-doi.html Tin tức như chú thích trên], theo Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timnath''' or '''Timnah''' ('''Timnath''') was a [[Philistines|Philistine]] city in [[Canaan]] that is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in {{bibleverse||Judges|14|HE}} and in connection with [[Samson]]. Modern archaeologists identify the ancient site with ''Tel Batash'' (alt. sp. ''Tell Butashi'') ({{lang-he|תל בטש}}), a [[Tell (archaeology)|tel]] lying on a flat, alluvial plain, located in the [[Sorek Valley]] ca. {{convert|7|km}} north-west of [[Beit Shemesh]], near [[moshav]] [[Tal Shahar]] in [[Israel]]. The site is not to be confused with the copper-smelting site of [[Timna valley|Timna]] in the [[Arabah]] near [[Eilat]].

The ''Tel Batash'' mound was discovered in the 19th-century by [[C. Clermont-Ganneau]] who identified it as a Roman military camp.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land'' (ed. E. Stern), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1993, p. 152 {{ISBN|965-220-209-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, the site was uncovered through 1977–1989, in 12 seasons of excavations, by [[Amihai Mazar]] and [[George L. Kelm]] while Kelm was serving as professor of Biblical Backgrounds and Archaeology at [[Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary]], on a dig sponsored by the Seminary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandyinstitute.org/history.cfm Tandy Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Center for Online Judaic Studies, [http://cojs.org/excavating_in_samson_country-_george_l-_kelm_and_amihai_mazar-_bar_15-01-_jan-feb_1989/ Excavating in Samson Country, George L. Kelm and Amihai Mazar, BAR 15:01, Jan-Feb 1989], accessed 11 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land'' (ed. E. Stern), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1993, p. 152 {{ISBN|965-220-209-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Timnath, Colorado]] in the United States is named for the city.

==Geography==
The ''Tel Batash'' site is strategically located in the [[Sorek Valley]], an access point from the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|Coastal Plain]] through the [[Shephelah]] and into the Central [[Judean Mountains]].

==History==
The ''Tel Batash'' site was first settled in the [[Middle Bronze Age]] by creating an earthen rampart that enclosed the 10 acre (4 hectare) site. Excavations under the leadership of Mazar and Kelm during the 1980s-1990s uncovered twelve strata of continuous settlement at the site through the [[Hellenistic]] period, with sparse settlement nearby during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period. It included fortifications and buildings from the [[Kingdom of Judah]] period, dating to the 7th and 8th centuries BCE. In one of the buildings, a ceramic [[potsherd]] bearing a written [[LMLK seal]] was found. Tel Batash during the [[Philistine]] era (Late Bronze Age to Iron Age) was a fortified city with dense mud-brick construction.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land'' (ed. E. Stern), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1993, p. 156 {{ISBN|965-220-209-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not far from the tel, on the edge of [[Nahal Sorek]] are the remains of a [[Roman road]] as well as settlement dating to the [[Chalcolithic]] and [[Canaan]]ite-periods.

Timnah (Timnath) is mentioned in {{bibleverse||Genesis|38|HE}} in the context of the story of [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|38:13|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in {{bibleverse||Judges|14|HE}} in the [[Samson]] saga, although some place the episode of Judah and Tamar in a different Timnah (Timnath), now called ''[[Khirbet et-Tibbaneh]]''. Samson went down to Timnah in order to find a wife. On his way there, he rent open a lion. Samson married a "girl of the [[Philistines]]" from Timnah and posed a riddle for the men of Timnah, which they were only able to resolve following the intervention of his wife.
&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|14:1-20|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruin lies ca. 2 kilometers north-east of Moshav [[Sdot Micha]] and about {{convert|1400|m|ft|}} south-west of ''Bîr el-Leimûn''.&lt;ref&gt;''Bîr el-Leimûn'' lies perpendicular to the ancient ruin of Tibna and the biblical city of Beit Shemesh (''ʻAin Shems''), being a junction on the road between [[Zorah]] and ''Tibna'' and where there is a well. As late as 1835 it was still inhabited, but is now a ruin. See: Edward Robinson &amp; Eli Smith, ''Biblical Researches in Palestine, Mount Sinai and Arabia Petraea'' (vol. III), Boston 1841, Arabic Lists - Second Appendix on p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the site is now restricted, as it sits in a military area, at an elevation of 225 metres (740 ft)&lt;ref&gt;''The Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement'', London 1871, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; above sea-level. Early explorers and historical geographers identified the ruin ''Kh. Tibna'' with the biblical town of Timnah, thought to be associated with stories of the biblical [[Samson]] (Judges 14:1-5).&lt;ref&gt;[[Marten Woudstra|Woudstra, Marten H.]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BfG1svPVYyQC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=khirbet+tibnah+beit+shemesh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TSMsBb2Q0K&amp;sig=MODaal0ZbirkHCEUPGH9fnfGNLM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KHXLTqTTIIagOuKItZQP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=khirbet%20tibnah%20beit%20shemesh&amp;f=false The Book of Joshua]'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Avraham Negev|author2=Shimon Gibson|title=Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&amp;pg=PA509|accessdate=4 October 2010|date=July 2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-8571-7|page=509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Neubauer, ''La Géographie du Talmud'', Paris 1868, pp. 102–103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 29–31 in:{{cite book|last=Guérin|first=Victor|authorlink=Victor Guérin|title=Description Géographique  Historique et Archéologique de la Palestine|url= https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongog02gu#page/28/mode/2up |volume=1: Judee,  pt. 2|year=1869|publisher= L'Imprimerie Nationale|location=Paris|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; French orientalist [[Clermont-Ganneau]] also thought ''Tibna'' to be a corruption of the Hebrew word Timnah.&lt;ref&gt;Page 214 in:{{cite book|last=Clermont-Ganneau|first=Charles Simon |authorlink=Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau|title=[ARP] Archaeological Researches in Palestine 1873-1874,  translated from the French by J.

[[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] visited the immediate area in 1838, and Tibna was already a deserted village.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Robinson, ''Biblical Researches in Palestine'', vol. II, section XI, London 1856, [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearc02smitgoog#page/n34/mode/2up pp. 16–17]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[W.F. Albright]] visited the site in the winter of 1924–25, which he described as "Khirbet Tibneh, the Timnath of the Samson story." He wrote that the site was covered with "masses of [[Graeco-Roman|Græco-Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] débris," although he was unable to come-up with Jewish potsherds.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 10 in: {{cite journal |last=Albright |first=W.F. |title=Topographical Researches in Judæa |journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research |accessdate=13 September 2018 |volume=18 |issue= |pages=7+9-11|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3218963 |date=1925|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, archaeologist [[Benjamin Mazar]] conducted a surface survey in the region - including ''Tell Butashi'', without digging.&lt;ref&gt;[[George L. Kelm|G. Kelm]] &amp; [[Amihai Mazar|A. Mazar]], "Timnah: A Biblical City in the Sorek Valley", in: ''Archaeology'', Vol. 37, No. 3 (May/June 1984), [[Archaeological Institute of America]], p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Some think that the Hebrew patriarch, [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]], may have gone to this Timnah (''Tibna'') to shear his sheep, when he met his daughter-in-law in passing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0138.htm#12 Genesis 38:14]&lt;/ref&gt; while others suggest that this would have happened in the Timnath now known as ''[[Khirbet et-Tibbaneh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See [[George L. Kelm]] &amp; [[Amihai Mazar]], p. 58 in: {{cite journal |last=Kelm |first=George |title=Timnah: A Biblical City in the Sorek Valley |journal=Archaeology |accessdate=20 August 2018 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=58-59, 78-79|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41729127 |date=1984|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[F.M Abel|F.M. Abel]], ''Géographie de la Palestine'' (vol. II), Paris 1938, p. 481, s.v. Thimna (1), citing Conder &amp; Kitchener's SWP, III, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Samuel Klein]], ''Eretz Yisrael: Geography of Israel for High Schools and for the People'' (Heb. ארץ ישראל -- גיאוגרפיה של ארץ ישראל לבתי ספר תיכוניים ולעם), Vienna 1922, p. 42 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, modern archaeologists think the biblical Timnath (Timnah) associated with the saga of Samson to have been situated where ''Tell Butashi'' is now located, a few kilometers to its north, along the Sorek valley, where extensive archaeological excavations have been conducted during the 1980s–1990s and where they have uncovered Middle Bronze Age artifacts. With the town's demise, the name "Timnah" is thought to have migrated to the site now known as ''Khirbet Tibna'', owing to its fame and popularity.

In {{bibleverse||Joshua|15:10|HE}}, the city is mentioned as a point on the border of the [[Tribe of Judah]]. {{bibleverse||Judges|14:5|NKJV}}refers to Timnah's [[vineyard]]s.

'''Umm Al Hassam''' ({{lang-ar|أم الحصم}}) (trans. ''Mother of Sea Shells'') is a middle-class neighbourhood on the southern coast of [[Manama]], which is the capital of [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banijamrah.info/hussain/?p=360 Umm Al Hassam: Photos and History].&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood is home to many members of Bahrain's local Jewish community. It consists of a mixture of grand villas and newer apartment buildings, and is well known for its [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] and [[Indian Cuisine|Indian]] restaurants.

[[Abdulaziz Shamlan]], a Bahraini nationalist leader from the 1950s and later Bahrain's Ambassador in [[Cairo]], is one of the area's most famous ex-residents, along with the late Yousuf Abdulrahman Engineer whose house symbolizes tradition.

'''Walter Joseph Ciszek''', S.J. (November 4, 1904 &amp;ndash; December 8, 1984) was a [[Polish-American]] [[Jesuit]] [[priest]] who conducted  [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] [[missionary]] work in the [[Soviet Union]] between 1939 and 1963.

Fifteen of these years were spent in [[incarceration|confinement]] and [[hard labor]] in the [[Gulag]], plus five preceding them&lt;ref name=ciszek/&gt; in [[Moscow]]'s infamous [[Lubyanka prison]]. He was released and returned to the [[United States]] in 1963, after which he wrote two books, including the [[memoir]] ''[[With God in Russia]]'', and served as a spiritual director.

Since 1990, Ciszek's life has been under consideration by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for possible [[beatification]] or [[canonization]]. His current title is [[Servant of God]].

==Early life and studies==
Ciszek was born on November 4, 1904, in the mining town of [[Shenandoah, Pennsylvania]], to Polish immigrants Mary (Mika) and Martin Ciszek,  who had emigrated to the [[United States]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=league/&gt; A former gang member, he shocked his family by deciding to become a priest. Ciszek entered the Jesuit [[novitiate]] in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]], [[New York State|New York]] in 1928. The following year, he volunteered to serve as a missionary to Russia, which had become the Soviet Union after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] 12 years before. Many religious rights for Soviet residents [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|were curtailed]], the religious believers were [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|openly persecuted]], and few religious believers had access to the services of a priest. Pope [[Pius XI]] made an appeal to priests from around the world to go to Russia as missionaries.&lt;ref name=league&gt;[http://www.ciszek.org/About_Ciszek.html "About Father Ciszek", the Father Walter Ciszek Prayer League]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Ciszek was sent to [[Rome]] to study [[theology]] and [[Russian language]], [[history of Russia|history]] and [[Eastern Catholicism|liturgy]] at the Pontifical Russian College (or '[[Russicum]]'). In 1937, he was ordained a [[priest]] in the [[Byzantine Rite]] in Rome taking the name of Vladimir (see [[Russian Greek Catholic Church]]).&lt;ref&gt;Members of the Byzantine-Rite [[Russian Catholic Church]], like members of other [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], are in [[full communion]] with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] but differ in rites, customs and canon law from the western, or Latin-Rite Catholic Church. The majority of Catholics in Russia have always been members of the Latin Rite church, however.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, Ciszek was sent to the Jesuit mission in Albertyn in eastern [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=league/&gt; With  the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] occupied eastern Poland and forced Ciszek to close his mission. Arriving in [[Lviv]], he realized that it would be very easy for a priest or two to enter the Soviet Union amid the streams of exiles going East. After securing the permission of [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Andrei Sheptytsky]], he crossed the border in 1940 under the assumed identity of ''Władymyr Łypynski''. With two of his fellow Jesuits, he travelled 2400&amp;nbsp;km (1500&amp;nbsp;mi) by train to the logging town of [[Chusovoy]], in the [[Ural Mountains]]. For one year, he worked as an unskilled logger, while discreetly performing religious ministry at the same time.

==Captivity in the Soviet Union==
{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}
Ciszek was arrested in 1941 under accusations of [[espionage]] for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and sent to the [[Lubyanka prison]] in Moscow, operated by the [[NKVD]] (internal security agency). There he spent a total of five years, most of which in [[solitary confinement]]. In 1942, he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]] under severe torture. He was convicted of [[espionage]]; he was [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] to 15 years hard labor in the GULAG.

Ciszek was to remain in Lubyanka for four more years. In 1946, he was sent by train to [[Krasnoyarsk]] then 20 days by boat to [[Norilsk]] in [[Siberia]]. There, he was to shovel coal onto [[Cargo ship|freighter]] [[Ship|vessels]], and later transferred to work in [[coal mine]]s. A year later, he was sent to work in construction at an ore processing plant. From 1953 to 1955, he worked in mines. His memoirs provide a vivid description of the revolts that spread through the GULAG in the aftermath of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death (see [[Norilsk uprising]]).

Throughout his lengthy imprisonment, Ciszek continued to pray, to celebrate [[Divine Liturgy]], hear [[Confession (religion)|confession]]s, conduct [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]]s and perform parish ministry. Until he was allowed to write to America in 1955, he was presumed dead by both his family and the Jesuit Order.

By April 22, 1955, Ciszek's hard labor sentence was complete, and he was released with restrictions in the city of Norilsk. At this time, he was finally able to write to his sisters in the United States.

Ciszek was ordered by the [[KGB]] to move in 1958 to Krasnoyarsk, where he secretly established mission parishes. After the KGB learned of this, he was forcibly transferred to [[Abakan]], 160&amp;nbsp;km (100&amp;nbsp;mi) to the south, where he worked as an automobile mechanic for four more years. In 1963, he finally received a letter from his sisters in the U.S. Several months later, the Soviet Union decided to return him (and an American student [[Marvin W. Makinen]]) to the United States in exchange for two Soviet agents. He was not informed of this until he was delivered to an official of the [[U.S. State Department]] and told he was still an American citizen.

==Release and later life==
{{Jesuit}}
After nearly 23 years of imprisonment, Ciszek was released on October 12, 1963, in exchange for two Soviet agents (Ivan Egorov, a Soviet U.N. functionary, and his wife Alexandra, arrested for espionage in July). After his return, he is quoted as stating, "I am an American, happy to be home; but in many ways I am almost a stranger."  In 1965, he began working and lecturing at the John XXIII Center at [[Fordham University]] (now the Center for Eastern Christian Studies at the [[University of Scranton]] in [[Scranton]], [[Pennsylvania]]), counseling and offering spiritual direction to those who visited him, until his death.

On December 8, 1984, Ciszek died after many years of declining health, and was [[burial|buried]] at the Jesuit Cemetery in [[Wernersville]], [[Pennsylvania]].

==Legacy==
Nine audio tapes of interviews conducted with Ciszek (ca. 1964) remain at [[Georgetown University]].

In 1985, a [[Carmelite]] [[nun]], Mother Marija, who was the [[:wikt:mother superior|mother superior]] of a [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Rite]] Carmelite monastery which Fr. Ciszek helped found, and formerly under his spiritual direction, began to petition for official recognition of Fr. Ciszek and his work within the Catholic Church. In 1990, Bishop Michael J. Dudick of the [[Eparchy]] of [[Passaic, New Jersey]], opened an official diocesan process of investigation for official recognition on the road to beatification, a step toward possible [[canonization]] as a [[saint]]. His case is currently being handled by the [[Diocese]] of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].

Ciszek Hall at [[Fordham University]] in [[New York City]] is named after Fr. Ciszek. It currently houses Jesuit scholastics in the first stage of formal study for the priesthood. Additionally, a small room has been set aside in honor of Fr. Ciszek.  It contains the (Latin) altar, sacred vessels, candle sticks, and crucifix Fr. Ciszek used, as well as a copy (in his own hand) of his final vows and a photocopy of a letter to a friend containing spiritual advice.  There is also a Ciszek Hall at the [[University of Scranton]]. Shenandoah, Pennsylvania also commemorated his legacy by the founding of a Catholic elementary school named Father Walter J. Ciszek School, later renamed Trinity Academy at the Father Walter J. Ciszek Education Center.

==Quotes==
*The power of prayer reaches beyond all efforts of man seeking to find meaning in life. This power is available to all; it can transform man's weaknesses, limitations and his sufferings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imagesofheaven.org/WalterCiszek.html Walter Ciszek, SJ Tribute by Images of Heaven&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Across that threshold I had been afraid to cross, things suddenly seemed so very simple. There was but a single vision, God, who was all in all; there was but one will that directed all things, God's will.  I had only to see it, to discern it in every circumstance in which I found myself, and let myself be ruled by it.  God is in all things, sustains all things, directs all things.  To discern this in every situation and circumstance, to see His will in all things, was to accept each circumstance and situation and let oneself be borne along in perfect confidence and trust.  Nothing could separate me from Him, because He was in all things. No danger could threaten me, no fear could shake me, except the fear of losing sight of Him.  The future, hidden as it was, was hidden in His will and therefore acceptable to me no matter what it might bring.  The past, with all its failures, was not forgotten; it remained to remind me of the weakness of human nature and the folly of putting any faith in self.  But it no longer depressed me.  I looked no longer to self to guide me, relied on it no longer in any way, so it could not again fail me. By renouncing, finally and completely, all control of my life and future destiny, I was relieved as a consequence of all responsibility. I was freed thereby from anxiety and worry, from every tension, and could float serenely upon the tide of God's sustaining providence in perfect peace of soul.&lt;ref name=ciszek&gt;{{cite book|last=Ciszek|first=Walter J.|title=He Leadeth Me|year=1973|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc.|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=0-89870-546-0|pages=79–80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmdVjLpJ5HUC&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;vq=across%20the%20threshold&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=across%20that%20threshold%20I%20had%20been%20afraid%20to%20cross&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yoshikazu Okada''' (岡田 良一), born February 27, 1901 in the [[Aoyama, Tokyo|Aoyama]] area of [[Tokyo]]'s [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]] Ward, also known as '''Kōtama Okada''', (岡田 光玉) was the founder of a [[new religious movement]] in [[Japan]] (''[[Japanese new religions|Shinshūkyō]]'') generally referred to as ''[[Mahikari]]''.

Yoshikazu Okada was born into a wealthy family as the son of Inasaburo, a [[major general]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Okada, who studied with [[Prince Chichibu]] (Yasuhito) and others who came from prominent Japanese families,&lt;ref&gt;SM Monthly teachings, June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; graduated from the Japanese Army Officer Training School in 1922 and was commissioned a lieutenant in the Japanese Imperial Guard. After serving in military campaigns in [[China]] and [[Indochina]], Okada retired from the army in 1941 due to a back injury with the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]]. 

Yoshikazu Okada established the [[Mahikari]] organization in 1959, which became known as ''Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan'' in 1963, and assumed the name of "Kōtama" ("Sphere of Light"). 

In 1974, with Okada's passing, there were court hearings held over several years. An amicable settlement was reached (wakai). Sakae Sekiguchi assumed leadership of Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan, and in 1978, Keishu Okada established Sukyo Mahikari.
