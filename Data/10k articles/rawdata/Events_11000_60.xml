      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5624">The '''South West Surrey by-election, 1984''' was a [[by-election|parliamentary by-election]] held on 3 May 1984 for the [[British House of Commons]] [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of [[South West Surrey (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Surrey]].

== Previous MP ==
The seat had become vacant on 10 March 1984. The constituency's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), [[Maurice Macmillan]], had died suddenly at the age of 63. He had recently acquired the [[courtesy title]] of Viscount Macmillan of Ovendon when his father (who would ultimately outlive him by nearly three years)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/29/newsid_2547000/2547307.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &amp;#124; 29 &amp;#124; 1986: Harold Macmillan dies |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-12-29 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created the [[Earl of Stockton]] on 24 February 1984.

Maurice Macmillan was a Cabinet minister in [[Edward Heath]]'s government in the 1970s, as well as the son of former Conservative Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]], who was still alive when his son died. He had been South West Surrey's MP since the constituency was created for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], having previously been MP for [[Farnham (UK Parliament constituency)|Farnham]] from [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966]].  Macmillan had first entered [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955 general election]] representing the constituency of [[Halifax (UK Parliament constituency)|Halifax]], but had lost his seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]].

== Candidates ==
Six candidates were nominated. They are listed below in descending order of votes.

1. Mrs Virginia Hilda Brunette Maxwell Bottomley (born 1948), was the Conservative candidate. She was a part-time psychiatric social worker, at the time of the by-election. She is married to [[Peter Bottomley]] who has also served as a Conservative MP.

Mrs Bottomley had contested the [[Isle of Wight (UK Parliament constituency)|Isle of Wight]] in the 1983 general election. Subsequent to the by-election she retained the seat, until she retired from the House of Commons and was granted a Life Peerage in 2005. She served as a member of [[John Major]]'s cabinet from 1992 until 1997.

2. The Liberal Party candidate, representing the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]], was freelance journalist and broadcaster [[Gavin Scott|Gavin Douglas Scott]] (born 1950). Since the by-election Scott has become known as a screenwriter.

3. The Labour nominee was [[Barbara Roche|Mrs Barbara Maureen Roche]] (born 1954), a barrister. Mrs Roche has subsequently been elected to Parliament and has served as a junior minister.

4. Victor Litvin was an Independent candidate, who upset some people with his unique ballot paper label.

5. Miss Helen Mary Anscomb was an Independent candidate, who frequently contested by-elections in the 1980s.

6. Peter Reid Smith, was another Independent candidate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45792">The '''2010 Georgian news report hoax''' was a fake news report aired by [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] television station [[Imedi TV]] on 13 March 2010.

==The broadcast==
''Special Report'' is a weekly programme which is broadcast on [[Imedi TV]] on Saturdays at 8:30pm. On 13 March 2010, Imedi brought forward the programme to 7:59pm, the timeslot allocated to ''Chronicle''. ''Chronicle'' which runs at 8:00pm is a major source of information for Imedi TV viewers.&lt;ref name="intentionally"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.geotimes.ge/index.php?m=home&amp;newsid=20848|title=Facts Suggest Imedi Video Was Intentionally Confusing|last=Khachidze|first=Keti|date=16 March 2010|publisher=[[Georgian Times]]|accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili in Tbilisi, March 22, 2008.jpg|thumb|President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] was reported to have been assassinated in the fake report.]]
The fake news report, which heavily utilised footage from the 2008 war in South Ossetia,&lt;ref name="opdemandapolrian" /&gt; began by Imedi accusing the Georgian opposition of the organisation of protests in [[Tbilisi]] due to alleged fraud in the Tbilisi city elections which were scheduled for 30 May. During the protests, unknown gunmen opened fire on the protestors, killing some. As a result, the opposition pleaded for the [[international community]] to assist in ousting the "Saakashvili tyranny".&lt;ref name="pavelexploit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17799&amp;Itemid=132|title=Moscow Exploits TV Invasion Hoax to Isolate Georgia |last=Felgenhauer|first=Pavel|authorlink=Pavel Felgenhauer|date=19 March 2010|publisher=[[Georgian Daily]]|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the protest in Tbilisi, an ambush in the [[South Ossetia]]n capital of [[Tskhinval]]i occurred, which killed the [[President of South Ossetia]] [[Eduard Kokoity]]. Moscow announced that it held proof of the involvement of Georgian security services in the Kokoity assassination, which Russia deemed to be a [[terrorist attack]].&lt;ref name="pavelexploit" /&gt; Allegedly pro-Russian opposition politicians, led by [[Nino Burdzhanadze]] and [[Zurab Nogaideli]] travelled to Tskhinval and accused Saakashvili of the killing of Kokoity.&lt;ref name="pavelexploit" /&gt; After the assassination, [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]] troops were mobilized and put on high alert. [[Georgian Land Forces|Georgian Army]] troops were mobilized, and took defensive positions around Tbilisi with heavy artillery. A ''people's government'' with Burdzhanadze at the helm declared the government of Saakashvili "illegal".&lt;ref name="pavelexploit" /&gt; Other Georgian opposition politicians who were held up as collaborators with the Russians included [[Zurab Dzidziguri]], [[Kakha Kukava]], [[Koba Davitashvili]], [[Levan Gachechiladze]] and [[Giorgi Khaindrava]].&lt;ref name="opdemandapolrian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/exsoviet/20100325/158304323.html|title=Georgian opposition demands apologies for fake invasion report|date=25 March 2010|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100326222716/http://en.rian.ru/exsoviet/20100325/158304323.html| archivedate= 26 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] is shown, with a Georgian voiceover, allegedly saying “Since the Saakashvili regime began open terrorism against South Ossetia, this international criminal must be stopped.

The broadcast stated that the West stood by and issued only "halfhearted protests".&lt;ref name="pavelexploit" /&gt; A speech said to have been given by President Saakashvili is shown, where he stated that Russia wanted to become an Empire, and instructed all eligible Georgians to join the military. Meanwhile, Russian planes are reported to have bombed targets all over Georgia, and Georgian volunteers are reported to be engaged in combat in [[Mtskheta]]. The report also included the scenario of the aircraft carrying [[Polish President]] [[Lech Kaczyński]] to Tbilisi being blown up, leading to the Polish President's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.regnum.ru/news/1263229.html |script-title=ru:Грузинская телекомпания Имеди "похоронила" президента Польши |date=15 March 2010 |publisher=[[Regnum News Agency]] |accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413162805/http://www.regnum.ru/news/1263229.html |archivedate=13 April 2010 |deadurl=no |language=ru |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the broadcast, public panic was sparked in Georgia, as many Georgians did not see the disclaimer at the beginning of the broadcast, and assumed that they were watching live events.&lt;ref name="bogusbbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20100313/158186479.html|title=Georgians panic over mock TV news report of Russian invasion|date=13 March 2010|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100317155910/http://en.rian.ru/world/20100313/158186479.html| archivedate= 17 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mollycorso"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/2010/03/32526-fake-georgia-tv-report-about.html|title=Fake Georgia TV Report About Russian Invasion Stranger Than Fiction |last=Corso|first=Molly|date=16 March 2010|publisher=Eurasia Review|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100323210835/http://www.eurasiareview.com/2010/03/32526-fake-georgia-tv-report-about.html| archivedate= 23 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of telephone calls to emergency services were made, citizens hurried to withdraw cash from [[automatic teller machines]], Georgian mobile phone networks crashed, and many prepared to flee Tbilisi and villages and towns near the border with South Ossetia.&lt;ref name="alberici" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rferlwhitmore"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Saakashvilis_Erratic_Response_To_Invasion_Hoax_Raises_Suspicions/1984530.html |title=Saakashvili's Erratic Response To Invasion Hoax Raises Suspicions |last=Whitmore |first=Brian |author2=RFE/RL Georgian Service |date=15 March 2010 |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |accessdate=28 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323015018/http://www.rferl.org/content/Saakashvilis_Erratic_Response_To_Invasion_Hoax_Raises_Suspicions/1984530.html |archivedate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some units of the [[Georgian Land Forces|Georgian Army]] took up defensive positions after hearing of the alleged invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cWMbWJRokE |title=Primetime Panic: Spoof report sparks fear and protests in Georgia |accessdate=2010-04-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100323032454/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cWMbWJRokE| archivedate= 23 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interfax]] began reporting the news in Russia of the invasion of Georgia and the assassination of Saakashvili, before David Cracknell, an employee of the Georgian government, sent a two-word text message to foreign journalists with the words "Not true".&lt;ref name="timehoax" /&gt;

Three people died while watching the hoax. Gaioz Odishelidze, a 50-year-old man from [[Aragvispiri]] in the [[Dusheti]] district, suffered a fatal heart attack whilst watching the program. According to his son, Odishelidze cried out "What the hell's going on?", before grabbing his chest and collapsing.

Former [[President of Georgia (country)|Georgian President]] [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] condemned the programme and said that it was intimidation by the [[Government of Georgia (country)|Georgian government]] of its own people. Shevardnadze also stated that the programme proved then [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] correct in his decision not to hold discussions with Saakashvili.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/03/18/5419273.html|title=Ex-Georgian President upholds opposition visit to Moscow |date=18 March 2010|publisher=[[Voice of Russia]]|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicos [[Patriarch Ilia II of Georgia]] condemned the programme, saying it was an insult to Georgia's people and [[Georgian Armed Forces|army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=7029|title=Georgian Patriarch slams Imedi TV provocation|date=15 March 2010|publisher=[[Interfax]]|accessdate=25 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a poll run by [[Kviris Palitra]], 63% of the 406 respondents believe that Saakashvili was involved in the preparation of the fake report, whilst 8.7% believe the President was uninvolved, with 28.3% indicating they were unsure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interpressnews.ge/en/index.php/permalink/16424.html |title=63.0 Percent of Respondents Consider Mikheil Saakashvili Participated in Preparation of Simulated Chronicle |date=29 March 2010 |publisher=Interpressnews.ge |accessdate=6 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004201756/http://www.interpressnews.ge/en/index.php/permalink/16424.html |archivedate=October 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.georusparitet.com/official_statement/20100329/151340911.html|script-title=ru:Саакашвили был причастен к "спецрепортажу" "Имеди" ? - опрос|last=Dzhavakhia|first=Eka|date=29 March 2010|publisher=Россиа - Грузиа: Информационный Паритет|accessdate=17 May 2012|location=[[Tbilisi]]|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgian journalist reactions===
The Imedi broadcast was condemned by many Georgian journalists who took part in protests at the Imedi TV building.&lt;ref name="bogusbbc" /&gt; Giorgi Udzilauri, a journalist with the [[Akhali Taoba]] newspaper noted that the programme demonstrated that [[propaganda]] has a large influence in Georgia, and went on to say that the programme was a test of public reaction towards the Georgian government's "next violence and military adventure", and that it appears the Government still holds such plans. Udzilauri also called Imedi a "propaganada trumpet" of the government, and stated his belief that those responsible should be taken to court, as creating panic is a crime against the State.&lt;ref name="journodenounce"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.geotimes.ge/index.php?m=home&amp;newsid=20949|title=Georgian Journalists Denounce Imedi Hoax Video|last=Tsivkarashvili|first=Shorena|date=22 March 2010|publisher=[[The Georgian Times]]|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luba Eliashvili stated their belief that Imedi should be charged, however, new laws in Georgia do not provide significant penalties. Eliashvili also stated that a positive outcome of the report is that people have lost their trust in Imedi and the "Mischists" forever.&lt;ref name="journodenounce" /&gt; Gia Iakobashvili, the Editor-in-Chief of presa.ge, stated their belief that all journalists should protest against Imedi, and that journalists should not participate in any Imedia programming.&lt;ref name="journodenounce" /&gt; Giorgi Mamatsashvili, a journalist with the [[Asaval-Dasavali]] newspaper, regarded the programme as a staged show, and after hearing the alleged telephone conversation between Tsamalashvili and Arveladze, stated his belief that the programme had the intent of creating panic and to implement the Government's ideology. Mamatsashvili also said that "Imedi has become a house of prostitution. This Government’s ideology is to fight against the Patriarch and destroy the Church."&lt;ref name="journodenounce" /&gt;

The Council of the Charter of Journalistic Ethics in Georgia had a meeting on 25 March 2010, in which they discussed journalistic ethics in the Georgian media. ''Special Report'' anchor Natia Koberidze was due to attend the meeting but later withdrew. Koberidze stated that she was ready to attend the Council meeting, but due to its public format, decided to withdraw as the meeting could be used as a mean to attack her. Eter Turadze, the Council head, stated at the meeting that it was not being held to punish anyone, although sanctions could be considered if the Council felt that journalistic ethical norms were breached. Turadze also said that the stated aim of the meeting was to call upon journalists to act according to ethical norms.&lt;ref name="gvantsa" /&gt; As a result of Koberidze's non-attendance at the meeting, the Council sent her 16 questions via email, which among other things asked her who was responsible for the fake news report being broadcast with visible warnings that it was only a simulation, and whether she had been put under any pressure. Koberidze replied to the questionnaire by saying that she did not violate the Charter, as warnings were given to viewers as the programme began that it was a simulation. She also stated she was not aware who was responsible for the absence of visible warnings during the programme.&lt;ref name="gvantsa" /&gt;

===Imedi response===
[[Giorgi Arveladze]], the [[General Director]] of Imedi TV, stated that the purpose of the program was to demonstrate to Georgians the external threats that they were faced with,&lt;ref name="intentionally" /&gt; saying, "The really unpleasant thing about yesterday's report&amp;nbsp;— and I want everyone to understand this well&amp;nbsp;— is that this report is as close to reality as possible, to what may really happen, and to what Georgia's enemies keep in mind".&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/7442366/Russia-invasion-spoof-report-spreads-panic-in-Georgia.html|title=Russia invasion spoof report spreads panic in Georgia|last=Osborn|first=Andrew|date=14 March 2010|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=24 March 2010|location=[[Moscow]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100317132431/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/7442366/Russia-invasion-spoof-report-spreads-panic-in-Georgia.html| archivedate= 17 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arveladze apologised for the panic which the broadcast caused in Georgia, but defended the report, and dismissed calls for him to resign. Whilst Arveladze refused to be drawn into questions on whether the broadcast breached the [[code of conduct]] for broadcasters, the [[Georgian National Communications Commission]] and the Young Lawyers' Association of Georgia said that Imedi had violated the code with its broadcast.&lt;ref name="civilimedidefend"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=22083|title=Imedi TV Chief Defends Fake Report|date=15 March 2010|publisher=[[Civil Georgia]]|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Imedi chief was also forced to defend against allegations that top officials in the Georgian government, including Saakashvili, were informed about the programme before it went to air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/exsoviet/20100316/158208735.html|title=Imedi head denies informing officials of fake report beforehand|date=16 March 2010|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100317162447/http://www.en.rian.ru/exsoviet/20100316/158208735.html| archivedate= 17 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a finding by the GNMC that the broadcast violated the broadcaster's code of conduct,&lt;ref name="frenchrian" /&gt; the broadcaster was directed to make a public apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.trend.az/regions/scaucasus/georgia/1654573.html|title=Imedi television obliged with apology |last=Kirtskhalia|first=N.|date=15 March 2010|publisher=[[Trend News Agency]]|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government response===

On 14 March 2010, speaking to residents in the [[Bolnisi]] region, Saakashvili appeared to defend the broadcast,&lt;ref name="rferlwhitmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="csmonitorweir" /&gt;&lt;ref name="esslemont"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8568762.stm|title=Georgians question un-reality TV |last=Esslemont|first=Tom|date=15 March 2010|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100322231732/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8568762.stm| archivedate= 22 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated "(i)t was indeed a very unpleasant program, but the most unpleasant thing is that it is extremely close to what can happen and to what Georgia's enemy has conceived".&lt;ref name="csmonitorweir" /&gt; The only part of the fake report that Saakashvili specifically objected to was the part which said that some of the [[Army of Georgia|Georgian Army]] had joined forces with the Russians, as it is according to Saakashvili an insult to those who are fighting for Georgia. However, during the [[Mukhrovani Mutiny]] Saakashvili called the same soldiers traitors and accused them of working for Russia. Military expert Giorgi Melitauri accused those behind the Mukhrovani Mutiny; those who carry out Saakashvili's propaganda orders; of being behind the writing of the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.geotimes.ge/index.php?m=home&amp;newsid=20939|title=Giorgi Melitauri: The programme was written by the same people who staged the Mukhrovani Mutiny|last=Bzhalava|first=Dali|author2=Melitauri, Giorgi|date=22 March 2010|publisher=[[The Georgian Times]]|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2010, a written statement appeared on the Georgian President's website, in which, aside from accusing Russia of having aggressive plans against Georgia, he called for higher journalistic ethical standards to prevent such incidents in the future.&lt;ref name="rferlwhitmore" /&gt;

[[Prime Minister of Georgia|Georgian Prime Minister]] [[Nika Gilauri]] speaking in [[Brussels]] rejected the notion that the government exercised any control over Imedi, citing the station's private ownership;&lt;ref name="frustration" /&gt; despite this, the station is widely perceived as being under the control of the government in Tbilisi.&lt;ref name="burnishingspiegel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,684192,00.html |title=Burnishing a Tarnished Image: Georgia Mounts American PR Campaign |last=Bidder |first=Benjamin |date=17 March 2010 |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=28 March 2010 |location=[[Moscow]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322235210/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0%2C1518%2C684192%2C00.html |archivedate=22 March 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taped telephone recordings===
On 15 March 2010, an audio recording alleged to be a telephone conversation between Arveladze and his deputy Eka Tsamalashvili was released by ''Forum.ge''; because of Arveladze's close ties to Saakashvili this raised suspicions that the Saakashvili had been involved in the broadcast.&lt;ref name="rferlwhitmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="messengermzia" /&gt; In the recording, a woman, allegedly Tsamalashvili, says that airing the report as if it were genuine news would be a violation of the Georgian Law on Broadcasting, and stated that a notification should be carried on screen telling viewers of the fake report that it was a simulation. A man, allegedly Arveladze, responds to the suggestion by saying that he had spoken to "Misha"&amp;nbsp;— a nickname for Saakashvili&amp;nbsp;— the day previous, and after being asked by Saakashvili whether the programme would be put to air as a regular Chronicle programme, he told him that it would. The man continued to say that he told Saakashvili that viewers would be told at the beginning of the broadcast that the programme was a simulation, but Saakashvili said not to do so, ostensibly because it would affect the effect of the programme.&lt;ref name="messengermzia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.messenger.com.ge/issues/2065_march_17_2010/2065_mzia.html|title=Taped phone conversation fuels discussions over Imedi TV hoax report|last=Kupunia |first=Mzia|date=17 March 2010|publisher=[[The Messenger (Georgia)]]|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man goes on to say that the general plot outline had been provided to [[Ghia Nodia]] and [[Zurab Davitashvili]], both former members of Saakashvili's government. After being asked about the plot outline, both Nodia and Davitashvili confirmed that they had received it from the television network prior to the broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=22088|title=Phone Tape Adds New Twist to Fake TV Report|date=16 March 2010|publisher=[[Civil Georgia]]|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arveladze denied the conversation took place and accused the Russian special services of fabricating the tape by stitching together phrases from different conversations to produce the recording. Tsamalashvili called the recording "absurd and a lie", and dismissed suggestions that she had received directions from government officials whilst working at Imedi. She also suggested involvement of Russian special services in the alleged fabrication.&lt;ref name="messengermzia" /&gt; Independent analyst Irakli Sesiashvili stated that the recording was "very close" to authentic, and stated his belief that the voices on the recording matched the alleged speakers manner of speaking. Sesiashvili also stated that it is impossible to "maintain natural intonation and idiolect in a fabricated tape".&lt;ref name="messengermzia" /&gt;

On 16 March 2010, an audio recording of an alleged telephone conversation between Saakashvili and the [[Minister of Culture (Georgia)|Georgian Minister of Culture]] [[Nika Rurua]] was anonymously posted online, and was partially aired by [[Rustavi 2]] in its 6pm [[news bulletin]]. In the recording, a man, allegedly Rurua calling from [[Paris]], asks whether the panic caused by the program had "calmed down". In response, another man, allegedly Saakashvili, says that the panic only lasted five minutes, and that Imedi should have placed a caption below the screen to advise viewers it was a simulation. The second man then says that the programme had predicted quite accurately the "Russian scenario", and that he had spoken to Arveladze and told this to him.&lt;ref name="saakrecordcivil"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=22093|title=More Fake TV Report-Related Phone Recording|date=16 March 2010|publisher=[[Civil Georgia]]|accessdate=27 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/recording-alleges-georgian-president-blame-fake-invasion-panic/story?id=10123722&amp;page=1|title=Recording Alleges Georgian President to Blame for Fake Invasion Panic|last=Marquardt|first=Alexander|date=17 March 2010|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=[[Moscow]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rurua accused the [[Federal Security Service|Russian Federal Security Service]] of fabricating the recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=22104|title=Authorities Rule Out Probe into Fake TV Report-Related Phone Recordings|date=19 March 2010|publisher=[[Civil Georgia]]|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irakli Sesiashvili suggested that [[Minister of the Interior (Georgia)|Georgian Interior Minister]] [[Vano Merabishvili]], or [[Ministry of the Interior (Georgia)|his ministry]], which is believed to engage in illegal phone-tapping, was behind the leaking of the telephone recordings to the internet, ostensibly in an attempt to discredit Saakashvili.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Georgian_Minister_Rules_Out_Probe_Into_Incriminating_Tapes/1989195.html|title=Georgian Minister Rules Out Probe Into Incriminating Tapes|date=20 March 2010|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|accessdate=28 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100406224832/http://www.rferl.org/content/Georgian_Minister_Rules_Out_Probe_Into_Incriminating_Tapes/1989195.html| archivedate= 6 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irakli Alasania]], the leader of [[Alliance for Georgia]], pressed authorities to carry out expert analysis of the recordings, and also said that foreign experts should participate in verifying whether the recordings are authentic. [[Giorgi Targamadze]], the leader of the [[Christian-Democratic Movement]], called for an ad-hoc parliamentary commission to investigate the case, but his proposal was knocked back by lawmakers of the ruling party, who dismissed it as "not serious".&lt;ref name="saakrecordcivil" /&gt;

==International reaction==
Andrei Nesterenko, the spokesman for the [[Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] said the Imedi program was irresponsible and immoral, and that Russia understood the anger in Georgia as a result of the airing. He also accused the government in Georgia of "political paranoia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/e78a48070f128a7b43256999005bcbb3/454885fac2ef9b59c32576e7005a574c?OpenDocument|title=Russian MFA Spokesman Andrei Nesterenko Response to Media Query Regarding the Recent Georgian Imedi TV Broadcast|date=15 March 2010|publisher=[[Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]|accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="russiacondemnsbbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8568836.stm|title=Russia condemns Georgian TV's 'immoral' invasion hoax |date=15 March 2010|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=27 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100324004942/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8568836.stm| archivedate= 24 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nesterenko also stated that Saakashvili's comments on the programme amounted to his approval of its contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=22085|title=Russian MFA Slams Imedi TV’s Fake Report|date=15 March 2010|publisher=[[Civil Georgia]]|accessdate=27 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dmitry Rogozin]], the [[Permanent Representative of Russia to NATO]], in an interview with [[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]] said that the programme was a grandiose provocation, and was the continuation of an [[information warfare|information war]] that Saakashvili continued to wage against Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/exsoviet/20100315/158194666.html|title=Georgian TV fake invasion report "part of information war against Russia"|date=15 March 2010|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|accessdate=25 March 2010|location=[[Moscow]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100317155803/http://en.rian.ru/exsoviet/20100315/158194666.html| archivedate= 17 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergey Alexandrovich Markov|Sergey Markov]], a member of the Russian [[State Duma]], opined that the programme was aimed at the opposition forces in Georgia, rather than Russia.

In calling the report irresponsible, [[Éric Fournier]], the [[Ambassador of France to Georgia|French ambassador to Georgia]], condemned the use of his image in the fake report. Imedi used archive footage of Fournier talking to journalists, and portrayed Fournier as telling viewers of results of meetings with the Georgian Foreign Minister, where they were briefed on Russia's military operations. Archive footage of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Czech Republic|Czech]] ambassadors were also used in the same segment.&lt;ref name="frenchrian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20100316/158214073.html|title=French ambassador blasts Imedi hoax report on Russian invasion|date=16 March 2010|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100322194539/http://en.rian.ru/world/20100316/158214073.html| archivedate= 22 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=22094|title=French Ambassador on Fake TV Report|date=16 March 2010|publisher=[[Civil Georgia]]|accessdate=25 March 2010|location=[[Tbilisi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/03/16/5342677.html|title=French ambassador to Georgia perplexed at Imedi hoax|date=16 March 2010|publisher=[[Voice of Russia]]|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis Keefe]], the [[Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Georgia|British ambassador in Tbilisi]], stated the use of archive footage of himself was a discourtesy to him as Ambassador, and that the program did a disservice to Georgia's reputation as having a responsible and independent media.

[[File:RIAN archive 770913 The final speech of the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee M. Gorbachev.jpg|thumbnail|Gorbachev's ending speech to the 27th Congress]]
The '''27th Congress of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]''' was held from 25 February to 6 March 1986 in [[Moscow]]. This was the first congress presided over by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as [[General Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee of the CPSU]]. In accordance with the pattern set 20 years earlier by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the congress occurred five years after the previous [[26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Congress]].  Much had changed in those five years.  Key figures of Soviet politics, [[Mikhail Suslov]], Leonid Brezhnev, [[Yuri Andropov]], [[Dmitriy Ustinov]], and [[Konstantin Chernenko]] had died, and Mikhail Gorbachev had become General Secretary of the Party.  For this reason the congress was widely anticipated, both at home and abroad, as an indicator of Gorbachev's new policies and directions.  The congress was attended by 4993 delegates. It elected the [[27th Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|27th Central Committee]].

The agenda of the congress:
* CC CPSU Report and the Party objectives (Given by Mikhail Gorbachev)
* New Party Statute release
* Political report of CC CPSU
* CPSU Central Revisional Commission report
* Report ''About the economic and social development of the USSR on 1986-1990 and in 2000 perspective''
* Elections of the central Party organs

This Congress became the penultimate in the [[history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

The '''Fifth [[World Festival of Youth and Students]]''' (WFYS) was held in 1955, in [[Warsaw]], the capital of the then [[People's Republic of Poland]].

The [[World Federation of Democratic Youth]] organized this festival during the rise of the [[peaceful coexistence]] concept introduced by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] among the socialist bloc. At the end of the 1950s, the colonialism was in its last years, and in the same year, the [[Bandung Conference]] was held. The conference strongly criticized the western powers for keeping their colonial possessions. The need for a struggle against the danger of nuclear annihilation and for the end of colonialism dominated the festival.

More than 30,000 young people from 114 countries participated in this edition of the festival.

The motto of the festival was '''''For Peace and Friendship – Against the Aggressive Imperialist Pacts'''''.

The festival's sports programme featured an [[Athletics at the 1955 World Festival of Youth and Students|athletics competition]].&lt;ref name=GBR&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/uie.htm World Student Games (UIE)]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2014-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of each broadcast of the film, a series of missing children's photographs and descriptions were displayed on the screen for viewers, and a number was given to call if a viewer had information about them. The 1985 photograph series was introduced by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in a pre-recorded message, "...maybe your eyes can help bring them home."&lt;ref name=adamagaindrawscallers&gt;{{Citation  | title = 'Adam' Again Draws Callers  | newspaper = [[Milwaukee Journal]]  | pages = Life/Style 2  | date = 30 April 1985  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IGoaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TCoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=adam%20walsh%20movie&amp;pg=3542%2C10229378  | accessdate = &lt;!-----6 June 2010-----&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[sequel]], ''Adam: His Song Continues'' followed on September 29, 1986, also starring Travanti and Williams.

The first part of the film portrays the story of the kidnapping and [[murder of Adam Walsh]] on July 27, 1981, along with the effects of this event on the marriage of [[John Walsh (television host)|John]] and Revé Walsh. The second part of the movie focuses on the Walsh's attempts to pass national child protection laws in the wake of Adam's murder, and the formation of awareness groups surrounding child disappearances. The film was written by [[Allan Leicht]] and directed by [[Michael Tuchner]].

==Production==
Filming of the movie was conducted in and around [[Houston, Texas]]. The scenes portrayed at the Hollywood Mall of [[Hollywood, Florida]], were filmed at the now-defunct [[Westwood Mall (Houston, Texas)|Westwood Mall]] in Houston, and at the [[Sears]] which was one of its former anchor stores.{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;ref name=filmingbeginsonadam&gt;{{Citation | title = Filming Begins on Television Movie 'Adam'  | newspaper = [[St. Petersburg Times]]  | pages = 26, TV Dial  | date = 19 June 1983  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0R8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-10DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4918%2C4180091  | accessdate = 5 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FilmingStartsOnTVMovie&gt;{{Citation  | title = Filming Starts on TV Movie About Abduction-Murder Of Adam Walsh  | newspaper = [[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]  | pages = Section D, State  | date = 8 June 1983  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TB0uAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cGgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2261%2C6261883  | accessdate = 30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sears store where some scenes were filmed is still standing.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

A hotline was also active, to take calls regarding the children.

==History and profile==
''Al Raya'' was launched by Gulf company for printing and publishing as a [[weekly newspaper]] on 10 December 1979.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite news|title=About us|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/static/aboutus|accessdate=19 September 2013|newspaper=Gulf Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=emb&gt;{{cite web|title=Information and Media|url=http://www.qatarembassy.net/page/information-and-media#8|publisher=Embassy of Qatar|accessdate=11 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716121901/http://www.qatarembassy.net/page/information-and-media#8|archive-date=16 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company which was founded by Ali bin Jaber Al Thani also owns ''[[Gulf Times]]'', an [[English language]] daily.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Raya newspaper|url=http://www.pressfair.com/publication/index.php?id=154|work=Press Fair|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in Doha,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Raya and Gulf Times Newspaper|url=http://qa.wowcity.com/doha/gpid/114429688224160479258/al-raya-gulf-times-newspaper.htm|work=Wow City|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Al Raya'' is the second Arabic newspaper published in Qatar.&lt;ref name=Rugh2004&gt;{{cite book|author=William A.

In 1996 a corpus was created which included 187 articles published in ''Al Raya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Blaise Cronin|title=Annual Review of Information Science and Technology 2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=km5ENgwjp0sC&amp;pg=PA511|accessdate=4 October 2014|date=1 October 2006|publisher=Information Today, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57387-276-8|page=511}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 April 2012 the paper launched the mapping mangroves project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Raya: Project Mapping Mangroves |url=http://www.qfi.org/news/199/Al-Raya:-Project-Mapping-Mangroves |work=Qatar Foundation International |accessdate=19 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054908/http://www.qfi.org/news/199/Al-Raya%3A-Project-Mapping-Mangroves |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s ''Al Raya'' had a circulation of 10,000 copies and was distributed in [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Egypt]] in addition to its native Qatar.&lt;ref name=arafa/&gt; Until 1995 when the other Arabic daily, ''[[Al-Watan (Qatar)|Al Watan]]'', was launched the paper enjoyed higher levels of circulation, but then lost its one-third of circulation.&lt;ref name=Rugh2004/&gt; In 2000 ''Al Raya'' was the second best selling newspaper in Qatar with a circulation of 18,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Press Trends|url=http://www.wan-press.org/ecrire/upload/wpt2004.pdf|work=World Association of Newspapers|accessdate=8 February 2015|location=Paris|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated circulation of the paper in 2003 was 8,000 copies.&lt;ref name=Rugh2004/&gt; ''Al Raya'''s circulation increased to 18,000 copies in 2008.&lt;ref name=irex/&gt; The online version of the paper was the 47th most visited website for 2010 in the [[MENA region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forbes Releases Top 50 MENA Online Newspapers; Lebanon Fails to Make Top 10|url=http://www.jadaoun.com/2803/forbes-releases-top-50-mena-online-newspapers-lebanon-fails-to-make-top-10/|accessdate=11 September 2014|work=Jad Aoun|date=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political stance and content==
Although ''Al Raya'' is privately owned it is the semi-official newspaper of Qatar.&lt;ref name=apn&gt;{{cite web|title=Qatar |url=http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/newspaysv2.php?id=126 |work=The Arab Press Network |accessdate=19 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053932/http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/newspaysv2.php?id=126 |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qatar profile|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14702519|accessdate=19 September 2013|work=BBC|date=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it has a pro-government stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qatar newspapers|url=http://www.worldpress.org/newspapers/MIDEAST/Qatar.cfm|work=World Press|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major rival of the daily is another Arabic Qatari newspaper ''[[Al Sharq]]'' which has opposite political stance.&lt;ref name=aaweek/&gt;

''Al Raya'' mostly provides news about the receptions and activities of the ruling family, [[Al Thani]], as well as about official events.&lt;ref name=apn/&gt; In addition, the daily has large supplements on sports and business as well as a special supplement called ''He and  She''.&lt;ref name=apn/&gt; The paper offered a weekly page on the [[environmental issues]] from 1999 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Najib Saab |title=The Environment in Arab Media |url=http://www.afedonline.org/afedreport/english/book14.pdf |work=Arab Forum for Environment and Development |accessdate=7 October 2014 |format=Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010170621/http://www.afedonline.org/afedreport/english/book14.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|2013 coup]] in Egypt, ''Al Raya'' concentrated on the ongoing demonstrations of supporters of [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|the Muslim Brotherhood]] and ousted President [[Mohamed Morsi]].&lt;ref name=aaweek&gt;{{cite journal|title=Of Egypt and Arabs|journal=Al Ahram Weekly|date=16 June 2013|volume=3383|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/3383/22/Of-Egypt-and-Arabs.aspx|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, an editorial of the paper argued that possible US-led intervention against Syria would not be celebrated, but the [[Bashar Assad|Assad regime]] was "useless" and caused no other option than such intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Middle East press apprehensive over Syria|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23878821|accessdate=19 September 2013|work=BBC|date=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''baby shower''' is a party of gift-giving or a ceremony that had different names in different cultures. It celebrates the delivery or expected birth of a child or the transformation of a woman into a mother.
[[File:Special occasion cakes (baby shower).jpg|thumb|Baby shower cake (note that the coverlet is turned back waiting for the new baby)]]

==Etymology==
The term ''shower'' is often assumed to mean that the expectant mother is "showered" with gifts. A related custom, called a [[bridal shower]], may have derived its name from the custom in the 19th century for the presents to be put inside a [[Parasol#China|parasol]], which when opened would "shower" the bride-to-be with gifts.&lt;ref name="SOSBIntro"&gt;{{cite book

 | year=2006 |publisher=Rutgers University Press | isbn=0-8135-3811-4 | chapter=Origins of Bridal Showers and Bachelorette Parties
 | pages =  26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively the term possibly denotes a "first showing" of the new baby to the wider family and circle of friends.

==Description==
[[File:Teatime in Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|left|Cake and [[finger food]]s are often served at baby showers.]]
Traditionally, baby showers are given only for the family's first child, and only women are invited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5n9RMTOzZOAC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=baby+shower+history+and+tradition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nNNAU_C4FIKMrgf48oCICA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=baby%20shower%20history%20and%20tradition&amp;f=false | title=The Complete Illustrated Pregnancy Companion | publisher=Fair Winds | author=Robin Elise Weiss | year=2009 | location=153 | pages=320 | isbn=1616734434}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this has changed in recent years, now allowing showers being split up for different audiences: workplace, mixed-sex, and feminist.&lt;ref name="random_history"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ritual and Ceremony: A History of Baby Showers|url = http://www.randomhistory.com/2008/11/01_baby.html|website = www.randomhistory.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities at baby showers include gift-giving and playing themed games.

Baby shower games vary, sometimes including standard games such as bingo, and sometimes being pregnancy-themed, such as "guess the mother's measurements" or "guess the baby". These games help let the close friends attending the shower bond with the mother, and enable the new family to say thanks ahead of time, figuring out who is willing and able to help them with the challenges of bringing up a child.

According to etiquette authority [[Miss Manners]], because the party centers on gift-giving,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nfIWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT499&amp;dq=baby+shower+gift-giving&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=29ZAU9u9EYjmrAfkwIGgDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=baby%20shower%20gift-giving&amp;f=false | title=Anthropology: The Human Challenge | publisher=Cengage Learning |author1=William Haviland |author2=Harald Prins |author3=Dana Walrath |author4=Bunny McBride | year=2013 | location=456 | pages=784 | isbn=1285677587}}&lt;/ref&gt; the baby shower is typically arranged and hosted by a close friend rather than a member of the family, since it is considered rude for families to beg for gifts on behalf of their members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/10/AR2010091005903.html |title =Miss Manners: Modesty is the best party policy |date =10 September 2010 |author =Martin, Judith |publisher =The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this custom varies by culture or region and in some it is expected and customary for a close female family member to host the baby shower, often the baby's maternal grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WYWoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=baby+shower+baby%27s+grandmother&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItVAU5SCG4j00gXx-IHwAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=baby%20shower%20baby's%20grandmother&amp;f=false | title=Understanding Chinese Society | publisher=Routledge | author=Xiaowei Zang | year=2012 | location=25 | pages=208 | isbn=1136632700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a baby shower is held after the birth of a baby, an invitation to attend the shower may be combined with a [[baby announcement]]. In the US, if a baby shower doesn't happen before the arrival of the baby, a sip-and-see party or other similar event can be organized after the birth.

== Gifts ==
Guests bring small gifts for the expectant mother. Mothers are usually given pampering treats. Typical gifts related to babies include [[diaper]]s, blankets, [[baby bottle]]s, clothes, and toys.   It is common to open the gifts during the party; sometimes the host will make a game of opening gifts.

== Family bonding ==
The baby shower is a family's first opportunity to gather people together to help play a part in their child's life. The new parents may wish to call on people to assist in the upbringing of their child, and help educate the child over time. People around the family, who care for them, want to be involved in the child's life, and a baby shower presents an opportunity for them to give gifts and be of help, showing their love for the family.&lt;ref name="thepregnancyzone"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepregnancyzone.com/pregnancy-tips/baby-showers/|title=Why to Have Baby Showers?|website=The Pregnancy Zone|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it happens before the birth, it allows the new family to thank everyone before the stress of a new baby and lack of sleep begins.

== History ==
[[File:Baby shower shortbread biscuits 1 (8515549806).jpg|thumb|Baby shower shortbread biscuits]]
The term "baby shower" is relatively new, but the celebrations and rituals associated with pregnancy and childbirth are both ancient and enduring.&lt;ref name="random_history" /&gt;

;Ancient India: In India, a pregnancy ritual has been followed since the vedic ages: an event called [[Seemantham|seemantha]], held in the 6th or 8th month. The mother-to-be is showered with dry fruits, sweets and other gifts that help the baby's growth. A musical event to please the baby's ears is the highlight of the ritual, as it was common knowledge that the baby's ears would start functioning within the womb.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The ritual prays for a healthy baby and mother, as well as a happy delivery and motherhood.
;Ancient Egypt: In ancient Egypt, rituals relating to the birth of a child took place after the event itself. Quite unlike modern baby showers, this involved the mother and the child being separated to "contain and eliminate the pollution of birth" – this may have included visiting local temples or shrines. After this, there may also have been household rituals that took place, but the specifics have been found hard to study as these are such female-centered events.&lt;ref name="random_history" /&gt;
;Ancient Greece: The ancient Greeks also celebrated pregnancy after the birth, with a shout (''oloyge'') after the labor has ended, to indicate that "peace had arrived". Five to seven days later, there is a ceremony called ''[[Amphidromia]]'', to indicate that the baby had integrated into the household. In wealthy families, the public ''dekate'' ceremony, after ten days, indicated the mother's return to society. (The ten-day period is still observed in modern-day Iran.)&lt;ref name="random_history" /&gt;
;Medieval Europe: Due to the likelihood a mother would die in childbirth, this time was recognized as having a great risk of spiritual danger in addition to the risk of physical danger. Priests would often visit women during labor so they could confess their sins. After the birth, usually on the same day, a baptism ceremony would take place for the baby. In this ceremony, the godparents would give gifts to the child, including a pair of silver spoons.&lt;ref name="random_history" /&gt;
;Renaissance Europe: Pregnancies at this time were celebrated with many different kinds of birth gifts: functional items, like wooden trays and bowls, as well as paintings, sculptures, and food. Childbirth was seen as almost mystical, and mothers-to-be were often surrounded with references to the [[Annunciation]] by way of encouragement and celebration.&lt;ref name="random_history" /&gt;
;Victorian Britain and North America: Victorian women would keep their pregnancies secret, upholding cultural standards of proper behavior, but after the baby was born, other women would often hold tea parties for the new mother. Superstitions sometimes led to speculation that a woman might be pregnant, such as two [[teaspoon]]s being accidentally placed together on a saucer. Gifts were usually hand-made, but the grandmother would give silver.&lt;ref name="random_history" /&gt;
;Modern North America: With the consumer ideology of the 1950s and 1960s, the modern baby shower started during the baby boom era and served the function of providing the mother and her home with material goods. This started the tradition of "showering" the mother with gifts, and brought about a more relaxed atmosphere with regards to the pregnancy.&lt;ref name="random_history" /&gt;
: While continuing the traditions from the 1950s, modern technology has changed the form a baby shower takes: games can include identifying baby parts on an [[Obstetric ultrasonography|sonogram]], and while traditional baby showers were female-exclusive, mixed-sex showers have increased in prevalence.&lt;ref name="random_history" /&gt;

==In different countries==
[[Image:Blue-yellow-diaper-cake.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Diaper cake]]
Baby showers and other social events to celebrate an impending or recent birth are popular around the world. They are often women-only social gatherings.

* In [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United States]], baby shower is a common tradition.
* In the [[United Kingdom]], baby showers are not historically customary, but are becoming more common.
* In [[Bangladesh]], in many places a party named "sadh" (সাধ) or "sadhbhokkhon" (সাধভক্ষণ) is observed on the 7th month of pregnancy. After this the woman resides in her father's house instead of her husband's until the birth.
* In [[Brazil]], a party called "chá de bebê" (baby tea) is offered before birth.
* In [[Bulgaria]], as a superstition, no baby gifts are given to the family prior to the baby's birth. However, family and friend would give or send unsolicited gifts to the newborn baby, even if some babies are kept from the public for the first 40 days to prevent early infections. 
* In [[Culture of China|Chinese]] tradition a baby shower, ''manyue'' (满月), is held one month after the baby is born. 
* In [[Hmong people|Hmong]] culture, a baby shower is called "Puv Hli," and is held one month after the baby is born.  A ceremony would be hosted by the paternal grandparents or the father to welcome the baby to the family by tying the baby's wrist with white yarn and/or strings. 
*In [[Italy]] such a party is not customary, nor part of traditional culture. At least at a national level.
* In [[Armenia]], a baby shower is called "qarasunq" (քառասունք) and is celebrated 40 days after the birth. It is a mixed party for all relatives and friends. Guests usually bring gifts for the baby or parents.
* In [[Iran]], a baby shower ([[Persian language|Persian]]:حمام زایمان) is also called a "sismooni party" ([[Persian language|Persian]]:جشن سیسمونی). It is celebrated 1–3 months before the baby's birth. Family and close friends give gifts intended for the baby such as a cot, toys, and baby clothes.
* In [[Costa Rica]], a baby shower party is called ''té de canastilla'' ("[[basket]] [[tea (meal)|tea]]"), and multiple events are held for a single pregnancy for the family, co-workers, and friends.
* In [[Nepal]], a baby-shower party is called "dahi-chiura" (दही चिउरा) and is celebrated in the 6th or 7th month of pregnancy.
* In [[Mongolia]], a baby shower is called "хүүхдийн угаалга" (huuhdyn ugaalga).
* In [[Hindu]] tradition, they are called by different names depending on the family's community. 
** In northern [[India]] it is known as ''godbharaai'', in western India, especially [[Maharashtra]], the celebration is known as ''dohaaljewan'', and in [[West Bengal]] and [[Odisha]] it is called ''saadhroshi''.
** In southern India, in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]] it is called ''[[seemantham]]'', ''[[valaikaapu]]'' or ''[[poochoottal]]'' (the expecting mother wears bangles and is adorned with flowers).
* In [[Karnataka]] it is called ''seemanta''(ಸೀಮಂತ) or ''kubasa'' (ಕುಬಸ). It is held when the woman is in her 5th, 7th, or 9th month of pregnancy.
* In coastal Karnataka, especially in Tulunadu (Tulu speaking region), the ceremony is also known as "baayake" ('ಬಾಯಕೆ'). Baayake in Tulu means desire. It is popularly considered that the pregnant women have desire to relish certain specific kind of fruits and eatables during the pregnancy period; and the ceremony was designed in the olden days to fulfill the desire or food cravings of the pregnant lady.
 Although these might be celebrated together, they are very different: ''seemantham'' is a religious ceremony, while ''valaikappu'' and ''poochoottal'' are purely social events much like Western baby showers. In a ''valaikappu'' or ''poochoottal'', music is played and the expectant mother is decked in traditional attire with lots of flowers and garlands made of [[jasmine]] or [[Jasminum sambac|mogra]]. A swing is decorated with flowers of her choice, which she uses to sit and swing. At times, symbolic cut-outs of moons and stars are put up. The elderly ladies from the household and community shower blessings on the expectant mother and gifts are given to her.
** In [[Gujarat]], it is known as ''seemant'' or ''kholo bharyo'', a religious ritual for most Gujarati Hindus during the 5th or 7th month of pregnancy, usually only for the first child. The expectant mother can only go to her father's house for delivery after her ''seemant''. They offer special prayer and food to the goddess "Randal, the wife of the Sun". 
** In [[Jain]] tradition, the baby shower ceremony is often called as "Shreemant". The expectant mother can go to her fathers house in the 5th month of [[pregnancy]] and has to come back before the baby shower ceremony. After the ceremony the expectant mother cannot go back to her fathers house. The ceremony is only performed on Sunday, Tuesday or Thursday of the 7th or 9th month of pregnancy. During the ceremony one of the practice is that the younger brother- in - law of the expectant mother dips his hands in [[Kumkuma]] water and slaps the expectant mother seven times on her cheeks and then the expectant mother slaps her younger brother - in - law seven times on his cheeks.
** In [[Kerala]] it is known as ''pulikudi'' or ''vayattu pongala''', and is practiced predominantly in the [[Nair]] community, though its popularity has spread to other Hindu sects over the years. On an auspicious day, after being massaged with homemade ayurvedic oil the woman has a customary bath with the help of the elderly women in the family. After this, the family deity is worshipped, invoking all the ''paradevatas'' (family deities) and a concoction of [[herbal]] medicines prepared in the traditional way, is given to the woman. She is dressed in new clothes and jewellery used for such occasions. A big difference in the western concept of baby shower and Hindu tradition is that the Hindu ceremony is a religious ceremony to pray for the baby's well-being. In most conservative families, gifts are bought for the mother-to-be but not the baby. The baby is showered with gifts only after birth.
* In the [[Islamic]] tradition of [[Aqiqah]], an animal (such as a sheep) is slaughtered on the seventh day after the birth, and the meat is distributed among relatives and the poor. The practice is considered [[sunnah]] and is not done universally.&lt;ref&gt;The sacred meadows : a structural analysis of religious symbolism in an East African town / by Abdul Hamid M. el Zein.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Raise your voices and kill your animals' : Islamic discourses on the Idd el-Hajj and sacrifices in Tanga (Tanzania) : authoritative texts, ritual practices and social identities / by Gerard C. van de Bruinhorst [http://hdl.handle.net/1887/12442 full text]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[South Africa]], a baby shower is called a ''stork party'' (named after the folk myth that a [[White stork#Storks and childbirth|white stork delivers babies]]), and typically takes place during the mother's 6th month. Stork parties, usually not attended by men and often organized as a surprise for the mother, involve silliness such as dressing up, and mothers receive gifts of baby supplies.
* In [[Nepal]] a baby shower is known as "dahi chiura khuwaune". The mother-to-be is given gifts from her elders and a meal is cooked for her according to her preferences. The pregnant mother is often invited by her relatives to eat meals with them. Pasni is a traditional celebration that often marks a baby boy's 6th month or a baby girl's 5th month, marking the transition to a diet higher in carbohydrates and allowing guests to bestow blessings, and money and other gifts. 
* In [[Guatemala]], only women attend this event. Middle-class women usually celebrate more than one baby shower (one with close friends, co-workers, family, etc.).
* In [[Russia]], and [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], there are no baby showers, though some of the younger generation are starting to adapt it.

==Baby showers for fathers==
Some baby showers are directed at the future father.  These may be more oriented towards drinking beer, watching sports, fishing, or playing video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/lifestyles/family/s_759997.html |title=Fathers-to-be get their own baby showers male style |publisher=TribLIVE |date=2011-10-03 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/relationship/125181054.html |title=It's buddies, beers and diapers |publisher=StarTribune.com |date=2011-07-08 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary nature of these gifts is diapers and/or diaper-related items.&lt;ref name="st"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yadegaran |first=Jessica |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/homegarden/2016297534_showers26.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130031319/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/homegarden/2016297534_showers26.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-30 |title=Home &amp; Garden &amp;#124; Diaper parties: Dad-to-be's answer to baby showers &amp;#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2011-09-25 |accessdate=2012-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="miss-manners"&gt;{{cite web|first=Judith |last=Martin |url=http://www.chron.com/life/article/Miss-Manners-Diaper-party-is-beyond-the-pail-1604050.php |title=Miss Manners: Diaper party is beyond the pail - Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization of the diaper party is typically done by the friends of the father-to-be as a way of helping to prepare for the coming child.

There has been some controversy over these, with [[Judith Martin]] calling them a "monstrous imposition",&lt;ref name="miss-manners" /&gt; although she was referring to the attitude of demanding gifts and not necessarily the male version of a baby shower.

==Biochemistry and effects==

A wide variety of [[alkaloid]] and non-alkaloid compounds have been identified in various species of ''ephedra''.  Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in ''ephedra'' (at concentrations of 0.02-3.4%), the most common are [[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abourashed |first=Ehab A. |author2=Abir T. El-Alfy |author3=Ikhlas A. Khan |author4=Larry Walker |title=Ephedra in perspective – a current review |journal=Phytotherapy Research |year=2003 |volume=17 |pages=703–712 |url=http://weightlosster.com/ephedra_in_perspective_a_current_review.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427101636/http://weightlosster.com/ephedra_in_perspective_a_current_review.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-04-27 |doi=10.1002/ptr.1337 |pmid=12916063 |issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are the sources of its [[stimulant]] and [[thermogenic]] effects.&lt;ref name="Abourashed_2003" /&gt; These compounds stimulate the brain, increase [[heart rate]], constrict blood vessels (increasing [[blood pressure]]), and expand bronchial tubes (making breathing easier). Their thermogenic properties cause an increase in metabolism, as evidenced by an increase in body heat.

Ephedra is widely used by athletes as a [[performance-enhancing drug]],&lt;ref name="Bents2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bents R, Marsh E |title=Patterns of ephedra and other stimulant use in collegiate hockey athletes |journal=Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=636–43 |year=2006 |pmid=17342884}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a lack of evidence that it improves athletic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bohn A, Khodaee M, Schwenk T |title=Ephedrine and other stimulants as ergogenic aids |journal=Curr Sports Med Rep |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=220–5 |year=2003 |pmid=12834578 |doi=10.1007/s11932-003-0009-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Calfee R, Fadale P |title=Popular ergogenic drugs and supplements in young athletes |journal=Pediatrics |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=e577–89 |year=2006 |pmid=16510635 |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ephedra may also be used as a precursor in the illicit manufacture of [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barker W, Antia U |title=A study of the use of Ephedra in the manufacture of methamphetamine |journal=Forensic Sci Int |volume=166 |issue=2–3 |pages=102–9 |year=2007 |pmid=16707238 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ephedra has been used as a weight-loss aid, sometimes in combination with [[aspirin]] and [[caffeine]]. Some studies in regulated and supervised environments have shown that ephedra is effective for marginal short-term weight loss (0.9&amp;nbsp;kg/month more than the placebo), although it was untested whether such weight loss is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boozer C, Daly P, Homel P, Solomon J, Blanchard D, Nasser J, Strauss R, Meredith T |title=Herbal ephedra/caffeine for weight loss: a 6-month randomized safety and efficacy trial |journal=Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=593–604 |year=2002 |pmid=12032741 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0802023}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several reports have documented a number of [[adverse event]]s attributable to unregulated ephedra supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woolf A, Watson W, Smolinske S, Litovitz T |title=The severity of toxic reactions to ephedra: comparisons to other botanical products and national trends from 1993–2002 |journal=Clin Toxicol |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=347–55 |year=2005 |pmid=16235509 |doi=10.1081/CLT-200066075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adverse effects]] of ephedra consumption may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, [[headache]], [[insomnia]], profuse perspiration, [[dehydration]], itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and [[hyperthermia]]. More serious potential side effects include [[Heart arrhythmia|irregular heartbeat]], [[seizure]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[stroke]], and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/69213.cfm | title = Ephedra information | publisher= [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] | accessdate = April 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purity and dosage==

There are no formal requirements for [[standardization]] or [[quality control]] of dietary supplements in the United States, and the dosage of effective ingredients in supplements may vary widely from brand to brand or batch to batch.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/health/feature/2000/06/07/ephedra/index.html "Swallowing Ephedra"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012181342/http://archive.salon.com/health/feature/2000/06/07/ephedra/index.html |date=2007-10-12 }}, by Sharon Brownlee.

==Regulation in the United States==
{{see also|Ephedrine#United States}}

Escalating concerns regarding the safety of ephedra supplements led the FDA to ban the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (specifically ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, and methylephedrine) in the United States in 2004. This ban was challenged by supplement manufacturers and initially overturned, but ultimately upheld.

===Initial concerns and industry response===

In 1997, in response to mounting concern over serious side effects of ephedra, the FDA proposed a ban on products containing 8&amp;nbsp;mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids and stricter labeling of low-dose ephedra supplements. The FDA also proposed that ephedra labels be required to disclose the health risks of ephedra, such as [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[stroke]], and death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr97064a.html "Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids; Proposed Rule"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214033309/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr97064a.html |date=2007-02-14 }}, from the [[Federal Register]], June 4, 1997. Accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the [[supplement industry]] created a [[public relations]] group, the Ephedra Education Council, to oppose the changes, and commissioned a scientific review by a private consulting firm, which reported that ephedra was safe.&lt;ref name="consumerreports"&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/health-fitness/drugs-supplements/dangerous-supplements-504/overview/index.htm "Dangerous supplements: Still at large"], from ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' magazine. Published May 2004, accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ephedra Education Council also attempted to block publication of a study confirming wide discrepancies between the labeled potency of supplements and the actual amount of ephedra in the product.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;

[[Metabolife]], makers of the best-selling brand of ephedra supplement, had received over 14,000 complaints of adverse events associated with its product. These reports were not initially provided to the FDA.&lt;ref name="consumerreports"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-08-15-ephedra_x.htm Criminal investigation sought for diet supplement seller], published in ''[[USA Today]]'' on August 15, 2002. Accessed April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founder of Metabolife, Michael Ellis, was sentenced in 2008 to six months in federal prison for his failure to report adverse effects from his company's products to the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10news.com/news/16554203/detail.html Metabolife Founder Sentenced For Lying To FDA]&lt;/ref&gt; Senators [[Orrin Hatch]] (R. Utah) and [[Tom Harkin]] (D. Iowa), authors of the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act, questioned the scientific basis for the FDA's proposed labeling changes and suggested that the number of problems reported were insufficient to warrant regulatory action. At the time, Senator Hatch's son was working for a firm hired to [[lobbying|lobby]] Congress and the FDA on behalf of ephedra manufacturers.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/300234371.html?dids=300234371:300234371&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+5%2C+2003&amp;author=Chuck+Neubauer%2C+Judy+Pasternak+and+Richard+T.+Cooper&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=The+Nation "Senator, His Son Get Boosts From Makers of Ephedra"], published in the [[Los Angeles Times]] on March 5, 2003. Purchase required to view full text. Accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the activities of the Ephedra Education Council, Metabolife spent more than $4 million between 1998 and 2000 lobbying against state regulation of ephedra in Texas.&lt;ref name="sciencewolfe"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfe S |title=Medicine.

Published in ''[[Business Week]]'' on September 2, 2002. Accessed March 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the FDA withdrew the proposed labeling changes and restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr00043a.html "Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids; Withdrawal in Part"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203041741/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr00043a.html |date=2007-02-03 }}, from the [[Federal Register]], April 3, 2000.

A review of ephedra-related adverse reactions, published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' in 2000, found a number of cases of [[sudden cardiac death]] or severe disability resulting from ephedra use, many of which occurred in young adults using ephedra in the labeled dosages.&lt;ref name=Haller_2000 /&gt; Subsequently, in response to pressure from the [[consumer advocacy]] group [[Public Citizen]],&lt;ref name="bw"/&gt; Metabolife was compelled by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in 2002 to turn over reports of over 15,000 ephedra-related adverse events, ranging from [[insomnia]] to death, which the company had previously withheld from the FDA.&lt;ref name="consumerreports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr2002"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=850679 "The Secret of Ephedra's Questionable Success"]. A report on "All Things Considered", [[National Public Radio]], November 22, 2002. Accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of ephedra was considered to have possibly contributed to the death of [[Minnesota Vikings]] [[offensive lineman]] [[Korey Stringer]] from [[heatstroke]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="stringer"&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2003/02/25/stringer_ephedra_ap/ Vikings: Stringer's use of ephedra contributed to death], published online by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' on February 25, 2003. Accessed March 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Bechler]], a [[pitcher]] for the [[Baltimore Orioles]], died of complications from heatstroke following a [[spring training]] workout on February 17, 2003. The [[medical examiner]] found that ephedra toxicity played a "significant role" in Bechler's sudden death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/orioles/2003-03-13-bechler-exam_x.htm "Medical examiner: Ephedra a factor in Bechler death"], from [[USA Today]], published March 13, 2003. Accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Bechler's death, the FDA re-opened its efforts to regulate ephedra use. According to Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]], "All of a sudden [after Bechler's death] Congress dropped objections to an ephedra ban and started demanding that the FDA act."&lt;ref name="consumerreports"/&gt;

Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] (R. Utah), who in 1999 had helped block the FDA's attempts to regulate ephedra, said in March 2003 that "...it has been obvious to even the most casual observer that problems exist", and called FDA action to regulate ephedra "long overdue."&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

===Ephedrine supplement ban===

In response to renewed calls for the regulation of ephedra, the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] commissioned a large [[meta-analysis]] of ephedra's safety and efficacy by the [[RAND Corporation]]. This study found that ephedra promoted modest short-term weight loss, but there was insufficient data to determine whether it was effective for long-term weight loss or performance enhancement. The use of ephedrine alkaloids in this study was associated with significant gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] side effects.&lt;ref name="rand"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shekelle P, Hardy M, Morton S, Maglione M, Mojica W, Suttorp M, Rhodes S, Jungvig L, Gagné J |title=Efficacy and safety of ephedra and ephedrine for weight loss and athletic performance: a meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=12 |pages=1537–45 |year=2003 |pmid=12672771 |doi=10.1001/jama.289.12.1537 | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=196247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost simultaneously, a study in ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' found that ephedrine alkaloids were 100 to 700 times more likely to cause a significant adverse reaction than other commonly used supplements such as [[kava]] or ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]''.&lt;ref name=Bent_2003/&gt;

On December 30, 2003, the FDA issued a [[press release]] recommending that consumers stop buying and using products containing ephedrine alkaloids, and indicating its intention to ban the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing supplements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/ephedra/december2003/ "FDA Announces Plans to Prohibit Sales of Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedra"]: Press release from the FDA website, issued December 30, 2003, accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, on April 12, 2004, the FDA issued a final rule banning the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. [[Tommy Thompson]], the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]], stated that "...These products pose unacceptable health risks, and any consumers who are still using them should stop immediately."&lt;ref name="fdaban"/&gt; Products containing ephedra extract remain legal to this day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Legal challenges===

Nutraceutical Corporation, a supplement manufacturer based in [[Park City, Utah]], challenged the legality of the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah [[Federal District Court]] ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be [[medical ethics|unethical]]. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E0DF113EF936A25757C0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=health&amp;pagewanted=print "Judge's Decision Lifts Ban On Sale of Ephedra in Utah"], from ''[[The New York Times]]'', published April 15, 2005. Accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling was appealed to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] in [[Denver, Colorado]]. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000 page administrative record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers.&lt;ref name="fdaappeal"/&gt; Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a [[writ of certiorari]] seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the [[United States Supreme Court]] declined to hear this petition. The sale of ephedra alkaloid-containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States.&lt;ref name="fdamain"/&gt; Sales of products containing ephedra extract not containing ephedrine remain legal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Use in sports==

Ephedrine is listed as a [[Doping (sport)|banned substance]] by both the [[International Olympic Committee]] and the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/Prohibited_List_2006_EN_FR_SP.pdf |title= World Anti-Doping Agency Prohibited List, 2006 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061213063046/http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/Prohibited_List_2006_EN_FR_SP.pdf |archivedate= 2006-12-13 |df=  }}.&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.50&amp;nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]])}} Accessed March 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Football League]] banned players from using ephedra as a dietary supplement in 2001 after the death of [[Minnesota Vikings]] [[offensive tackle]] [[Korey Stringer]]; ephedra was found in Stringer's locker and lawyers for the team contended that it contributed to his death.&lt;ref name="stringer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sauerbrun"&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_4022235%20Todd%20Sauerbrun Sauerbrun fails test: Broncos punter faces suspension for use of ephedra], by Bill Williamson.

'''Flyting''' or '''fliting''' is a contest consisting of the exchange of insults, often conducted in verse, between two parties.&lt;ref&gt;Parks, Ward. "Flyting, Sounding, Debate: Three Verbal Contest Genres", ''Poetics Today'' '''7'''.3, Poetics of Fiction (1986:439-458) provided some variable in the verbal contest, to provide a basis for differentiating the [[genre]]s of flyting, sounding, and [[debate]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Flyting is a ritual, poetic exchange of insults practised mainly between the 5th and 16th centuries. The root is the [[Old English]] word {{lang|ang|flītan}} meaning quarrel. Examples of flyting are found throughout Norse, Celtic,&lt;ref name="Icelandic vis-à-vis Irish flyting"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/6i/6_sayers.pdf | title=Serial Defamation in Two Medieval Tales: The Icelandic  Ölkofra Þáttr  and The Irish Scéla Mucce Meic Dathó | work=Oral Tradition | date=1991 | accessdate=2016-03-16 | author=Sayers, William | pages=35–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Medieval]] literature involving both historical and mythological figures. The exchanges would become extremely provocative, often involving accusations of [[cowardice]] or [[sexual perversion]].

Norse literature contains stories of the gods flyting. For example, in ''[[Lokasenna]]'' the god [[Loki]] insults the other gods in the hall of [[Ægir]] and the poem ''[[Hárbarðsljóð]]'' in which Hárbarðr (generally considered to be [[Odin]] in disguise) engages in flyting with [[Thor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Byock |first=Jesse |authorlink= |title=Feud in the Icelandic Saga |publisher=University of California Press |year=1983 |origyear=1982 |location=Berkeley |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yPUnnVkWf4sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-520-08259-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the confrontation of [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]] and [[Unferð]] in the poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', flytings were used as either a prelude to battle or as a form of combat in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;Clover, Carol (1980). "The Germanic Context of the Unferth Episode", ''Spoeculum'' '''55'''  pp. 444-468.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Anglo-Saxon England]], flyting would take place in a feasting hall. The winner would be decided by the reactions of those watching the exchange. The winner would drink a large cup of beer or [[mead]] in victory, then invite the loser to drink as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Quaestio: selected proceedings of the Cambridge Colloquium in Anglo-Saxon, Norse, and Celtic'' Volumes 2-3, p43-44, University of Cambridge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13th century poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'' contain elements of flyting.

Flyting became public entertainment in [[Scotland]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, when [[makar]]s would engage in verbal contests of provocative, often sexual and [[Scatology#Literature|scatological]] but highly poetic abuse. Flyting was permitted despite the fact that the penalty for profanities in public was a fine of 20 shillings (over £300 in {{CURRENTYEAR}} prices) for a lord, or a whipping for a servant.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt; [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] and [[James V of Scotland|James V]] encouraged "court flyting" between poets for their entertainment and occasionally engaged with them. ''[[The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie]]'' records a contest between [[William Dunbar]] and [[Walter Kennedy (poet)|Walter Kennedy]] in front of James IV, which includes the earliest recorded use of the word [[shit]] as a personal insult.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;''An encyclopedia of swearing: the social history of oaths, profanity, foul language, and ethnic slurs in the English-speaking world'', Geoffrey Hughes, M.E. Sharpe, 2006, p175&lt;/ref&gt; In 1536 the poet [[David Lyndsay|Sir David Lyndsay]] composed a [[ribaldry|ribald]] 60-line flyte to James V after the King demanded a response to a flyte.

Flytings appear in several of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays. [[Margaret Galway]] analysed 13 comic flytings and several other ritual exchanges in the tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Galway, ''Flyting in Shakespeare's Comedies'', The Shakespeare Association Bulletin'', vol. 10, 1935, pp. 183-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Flytings also appear in Nicholas Udall's ''[[Ralph Roister Doister]]'' and John Still's ''[[John Still#Gammer Gurton's Needle|Gammer Gurton's Needle]]'' from the same era.

While flyting died out in Scottish writing after the Middle Ages, it continued for writers of Celtic background. [[Robert Burns]] parodied flyting in his poem, "[[To a Louse]]," and [[James Joyce]]'s poem "The Holy Office" is a curse upon society by a bard.&lt;ref&gt;"flyting." ''Merriam Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature''. Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, 1995. ''Literature Resource Center''. Web. 1 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce played with the traditional two-character exchange by making one of the characters society as a whole.

In modern portrayals, the climactic scene in [[Rick Riordan]]'s novel ''[[The Ship of the Dead]]'' consists of a flyting between the protagonist [[Magnus Chase]] and the Norse god Loki.

== Similar practices ==
Hilary Mackie has detected in the ''[[Iliad]]'' a consistent differentiation between representations in Greek of Achaean and Trojan speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mackie |first=Hilary Susan |authorlink= |title=Talking Trojan: Speech and Community in the Iliad |publisher=Rowmann &amp; Littlefield |year=1996 |location=Lanham MD |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A3F_so8HNg4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-8476-8254-4}}, reviewed by Joshua T. Katz in ''Language'' '''74'''.2 (1998) pp. 408-09.&lt;/ref&gt; where Achaeans repeatedly engage in public, ritualized abuse: "Achaeans are proficient at blame, while Trojans perform praise poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Mackie 1996:83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taunting songs are present in the [[Inuit]] culture, among many others. Flyting can also be found in [[Arabic poetry]] in a popular form called ''naqā’iḍ'', as well as the competitive verses of Japanese [[Haikai]].

Echoes of the genre continue into modern poetry. [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]'s poem ''[[A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle]]'', for example, has many passages of flyting in which the poet's opponent is, in effect, the rest of humanity.

Flyting is similar in both form and function to the modern practice of [[freestyle battle]]s between rappers and the historic practice of [[the Dozens]], a verbal-combat game representing a synthesis of flyting and its [[Early Modern English]] descendants with comparable African verbal-combat games such as ''Ikocha Nkocha''.&lt;ref name="rap"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3998862/Rap-music-originated-in-medieval-Scottish-pubs-claims-American-professor.html |title=Rap music originated in medieval Scottish pubs, claims American professor |accessdate=2008-12-30 |last=Johnson |first=Simon |work=telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=2008-12-28 |quote=Professor Ferenc Szasz argued that so-called [[rap battles]], where two or more performers trade elaborate insults, derive from the ancient Caledonian art of "flyting." According to the theory, Scottish slave owners took the tradition with them to the United States, where it was adopted and developed by slaves, emerging many years later as rap; see also John Dollard, "The Dozens: the dialect of insult", ''American Image'' '''1''' (1939), pp 3-24; Roger D. Abrahams, "Playing the dozens", ''Journal of American Folklore'' '''75''' (1962), pp 209-18.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finnic [[Kalevala]] the hero [[Väinämöinen]] uses similar practice of ''kilpalaulanta'' (duel singing) to win opposing [[Joukahainen]].

== Recreation ==
In a May 2010 episode of the [[Channel 4]] series ''[[Time Team]]'', archaeologists [[Matt Williams (archaeologist)|Matt Williams]] and [[Phil Harding (archaeologist)|Phil Harding]] engage in some mock flyting in [[Old English]] written by Saxon historian [[Sam Newton]] to demonstrate the practice. For example, "Mattaeus, ic þé onsecge þæt þín scofl is nú unscearp æfter géara ungebótes" ("Matthew, I to thee say that thine shovel is now blunt after years of misuse").

'''''Get Karl! Oh Soo-jung''''' ({{ko-hhrm|칼잡이 오수정||Kal Jabi O Sujeong}}) is a 2007 South Korean romantic comedy [[Korean drama|television series]] starring [[Uhm Jung-hwa]] and [[Oh Ji-ho]]. It aired on [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] from July 28 to September 16, 2007 on Saturdays and Sundays at 21:45 for 16 episodes.

The series is based on the real-life love story of Lee Ju-young, the [[CEO]] of [[Doremi Entertainment|the drama's production company]] who reunited with her current husband ten years after breaking up with him. Moreover, Go Man-soo is the actual name of Lee's pro-golfer husband who incidentally instructed Oh Ji-ho on his golf swings in preparation for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get Karl!

==Plot==
Throughout her school days, Oh Soo-jung ([[Uhm Jung-hwa]]) was the girl every boy wanted to date and every girl wanted to be. But having watched her poor family disintegrate after her mother abandoned her incompetent father, Soo-jung naturally became cynical and demanding when it came to picking her choice of man. She dates Go Man-soo ([[Oh Ji-ho]]), an [[Ivy League]] law student, despite the lack of physical attraction (he is overweight and nerdy). But the moment she finds out that he failed his bar exam, poor Man-soo gets dumped. But eight years later, the tables are turned. Soo-jung, now in her thirties, is no longer in demand. The former "it girl" has since fallen from grace. She manages the jewelry store owned by a less attractive schoolmate who married a lawyer and now barks at Soo-jung every chance she gets.

Man-soo returns from the States a changed man; he has transformed into famous, rich, hunky pro-golfer Karl Go. He hires Jung Woo-tak ([[Kang Sung-jin]]) to play a wealthy bachelor, and once Soo-jungs fall in love with him, he's to jilt her at the altar, just like she did to Man-soo. Meanwhile, Karl pretends to be the debt-ridden boyfriend of Soo-jung's boarder Yook Dae-soon (Park Da-an). But his revenge plans go awry when he and Soo-jung fall in love with each other again. On her wedding day to Woo-tak, Soo-jung runs away and chooses Karl despite believing he's poor. Bitter that Karl chose a girdle-clad "old maid" over her, Dae-soon not only steals her creative ideas for jewelry design but reveals to Soo-jung that Karl has been making a fool of her all this time. In the end, Soo-jung triumphs over Dae-soon professionally, then proposes to Karl and they finally get married.

'''Gig''' is slang for a live [[music]]al performance. Originally coined in the 1920s by [[jazz]] musicians,&lt;ref name=Partridge&gt;{{cite book|last1=Partridge |first1=Eric |last2=Dalzell |first2=Tom |last3=Victor |first3=Terry |title=The concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional English |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UIjVGcSe8MC&amp;pg=PA288 |year=2007 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=0-415-21259-6 |page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term, short for the word "engagement", now refers to any aspect of performing such as assisting with performance and attending musical performance. More broadly, the term "gigging" means having paid work, being employed.&lt;ref name=Partridge/&gt;

A gig is sometimes called a "set", referring to the [[set list]] of compositions played.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/J403400 Set (i)]", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd Edition'' (via [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Oxford Music Online]]), accessed February 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' describes it as "a term commonly applied to a musical engagement of one night's duration only; to undertake such an engagement,"&lt;ref&gt;'Gig', Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 6 Oct 2007), &lt;http://www.grovemusic.com&gt; - Included in R. S. Gold: ''A Jazz Lexicon: an A-Z Dictionary of Jazz Terms'' (New York, 1964, rev. 2/1975 as ''Jazz Talk'')&lt;/ref&gt; (although the term "regular gig" is common in reference to a repeating engagement). The first documented use of this term in this way appears in 1926: ''[[Melody Maker| Melody Maker 7 September 1926]]'', with the story [[byline]] stating, "One Popular Gig Band Makes Use of a Nicely Printed Booklet."&lt;ref&gt;gig, pg.6 ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd ed. 1989. Oxygen University Press. 6 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Louisiana Holiday Trail of Lights''' is eight cities in north Louisiana - Shreveport, Bossier City, Minden, Monroe, West Monroe, Natchitoches and Alexandria, Pineville - that collectively offer festivals, parades, fireworks shows, shopping and dining in each of the cities starting the day after Thanksgiving through the New Year. 

One of the most iconic festivals along the Louisiana Holiday Trail of Lights is the [[Natchitoches Christmas Festival]], also called the "Festival of Lights," in Natchitoches. It was started in 1927, making it one of the oldest light festivals in the US &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisianatravel.com/celebrate-season-along-holiday-trail-lights Louisiana Official Tourism Site] Accessed February 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. In the largest north Louisiana city on the Trail, Shreveport offer Christmas in Roseland at the [[American Rose Center]], Rockets Over the Red Fireworks, Christmas on Caddo Fireworks, nightly blizzards at the Louisiana Boardwalk Outlets and other events. Minden's big holiday celebration is Fasching. Alexandria/Pineville offers WinterFete and Monroe-West Monroe is known for Antique Alley shopping.
[[File:Christmas Parade at the Louisiana Boardwalk Outlets.jpg|alt=Louisiana Boardwalk Outlets Christmas Parade|thumb|Each year the public is invited to a Christmas parade to celebrate the holidays at the Louisiana Boardwalk Outlets in Bossier City, LA.]]
All of the cities are within a one-hour drive of each other on Interstates 20 and 49. The official website is [[www.holidaytrailoflights.com]].

The '''Inter-Regional Deputies' Group''' ({{lang-ru|Межрегиональная депутатская группа, МДГ}}) was the first legal parliamentary opposition in the [[Soviet Union]], a fraction formed in 1989 within the 1st [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]]. It was the base of the formation of the [[Democratic Russia|Democratic Russia Election Bloc]] whose main political goal, suggested by [[Andrei Sakharov]], was to remove the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] from power, in particular to remove the declaration of its leading role from the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union|constitution]]. The Inter-Regional Group operated until 1991. It was dissolved due to lack of the common constructive programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sovsekretno.ru/articles/id/2437/ Вся власть – Моссовету!], Leonid Velekhov's interview with [[Gavriil Kharitonovich Popov|Gavriil Popov]], "Совершенно секретно", No.3/250&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iraq War'''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The conflict is also known as the '''War in Iraq''', the '''Occupation of Iraq''', the '''Second Gulf War''', and '''Gulf War II'''. The period of the war lasting from 2003 to 2010 was referred to as '''Operation Iraqi Freedom''' by the United States military.&lt;/ref&gt; was a protracted armed conflict that began in 2003 with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] by a [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|United States-led coalition]] that overthrew the [[government of Saddam Hussein]]. The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|insurgency]] emerged to oppose the [[Multi-National Force&amp;nbsp;– Iraq|occupying forces]] and the post-invasion Iraqi government.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web |title=Iraq War|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/870845/Iraq-War
|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated [[Casualties of the Iraq War|151,000 to 600,000 or more]] Iraqis were killed in the first 3–4 years of conflict. The U.S. became [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|re-involved in 2014]] at the head of a [[Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve|new coalition]]; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue. The invasion occurred as part of a [[War on Terror|declared war against international terrorism and its sponsors]] under the administration of U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] following the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]].

The invasion began on 20 March 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Iraq-War|title=Iraq War {{!}} 2003–2011|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the U.S., joined by the United Kingdom and several coalition allies, launching a "[[shock and awe]]" bombing campaign. Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as U.S. forces swept through the country. The invasion led to the collapse of the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'athist government]]; Saddam was captured during [[Operation Red Dawn]] in December of that same year and [[Execution of Saddam Hussein|executed by a military court three years later]]. However, the power vacuum following Saddam's demise and the mismanagement of [[Coalition Provisional Authority|the occupation]] led to widespread [[Civil war in Iraq (2006–07)|sectarian violence]] between [[Shia Islam|Shias]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]], as well as a [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|lengthy insurgency against U.S. and coalition forces]]. Many violent insurgent groups were supported by [[Iran]] and [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]]. The United States responded with a [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|troop surge in 2007]]. The winding down of U.S. involvement in Iraq accelerated under President [[Barack Obama]]. The U.S. formally withdrew all combat troops from Iraq by December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |first=Ben |last=Feller |title=Obama sets firm withdrawal timetable for Iraq |date=27 February 2009 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090227/ap_on_go_pr_wh/obama_iraq |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302175610/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090227/ap_on_go_pr_wh/obama_iraq |archivedate= 2 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[George W. Bush Administration|Bush administration]] based its [[Rationale for the Iraq War|rationale for the war]] principally on the assertion that Iraq, which had been viewed by the U.S. as a [[rogue state]] since the 1990-1991 [[Gulf War]], possessed [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) and that the Iraqi government posed an immediate threat to the United States and its coalition allies.&lt;ref&gt;Center for American Progress (29 January 2004) [https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/news/2004/01/29/459/in-their-own-words-iraqs-imminent-threat/ "In Their Own Words: Iraq's 'Imminent' Threat"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115202751/https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/news/2004/01/29/459/in-their-own-words-iraqs-imminent-threat/ |date=15 January 2016 }} ''americanprogress.org''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] (28 January 2004) [https://fas.org/irp/congress/2004_cr/s012804b.html "New Information on Iraq's Possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction",] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420112938/https://fas.org/irp/congress/2004_cr/s012804b.html |date=20 April 2016 }} ''Congressional Record''&lt;/ref&gt; Select U.S.&amp;nbsp;officials accused Saddam of harbouring and supporting [[al-Qaeda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/033jgqyi.asp |publisher=The Weekly Standard |title=Saddam's al Qaeda Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others cited the desire to end a repressive dictatorship and bring democracy to the people of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030226-11.html "President Discusses the Future of Iraq"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801014545/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030226-11.html |date=1 August 2016 }} The White House, 26 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/09/60minutes/main592330.shtml "Bush Sought 'Way' To Invade Iraq?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008111954/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/09/60minutes/main592330.shtml |date=8 October 2013 }} ''60 Minutes''&lt;/ref&gt; After the invasion, no substantial evidence was found to verify the initial claims about WMDs, while [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations|claims of Iraqi officials collaborating with al-Qaeda]] were proven false.

In the aftermath of the invasion, Iraq held [[Iraqi parliamentary election, January 2005|multi-party elections]] in 2005. [[Nouri al-Maliki]] became Prime Minister in 2006 and remained in office until 2014. The al-Maliki government enacted policies that were widely seen as having the effect of alienating the country's [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] minority and worsening sectarian tensions. In the summer of 2014, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) launched a military offensive in Northern Iraq and declared a worldwide Islamic [[caliphate]], eliciting another [[Operation Inherent Resolve|military response from the United States and its allies]]. The Iraq War caused over a hundred thousand civilian deaths and tens of thousands of military deaths (see estimates [[Iraq War#Casualty estimates|below]]). The majority of deaths occurred as a result of the insurgency and civil conflicts between 2004 and 2007.

[[File:WeaponsInspector.JPG|thumb|left|A UN weapons inspector in Iraq, 2002.]]

Strong international opposition to the Saddam Hussein regime began after Iraq's [[invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990.  The international community condemned the invasion,&lt;ref name=Global&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/1990/900816-151051.htm "World Acts Against Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921182559/http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/1990/900816-151051.htm |date=21 September 2016 }}. GlobalSecurity.org.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1991 a military coalition led by the United States launched the [[Gulf War]] to expel Iraq from Kuwait.  Following the Gulf War, the US and its allies tried to keep Saddam in check with a policy of [[containment]]. This policy involved numerous [[Iraq sanctions|economic sanctions]] by the [[UN Security Council]]; the enforcement of [[Iraqi no-fly zones]] declared by the US and the UK to protect the [[Kurds]] in Iraqi Kurdistan and [[Shia]]s in the south from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government; and ongoing inspections to ensure Iraq's compliance with United Nations resolutions concerning [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraqi weapons of mass destruction]].

The inspections were carried out by the [[United Nations Special Commission]] (UNSCOM).  UNSCOM, in cooperation with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], worked to ensure that Iraq destroyed its chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and facilities.&lt;ref name="Zilinskas"&gt;Zilinskas, Raymond A., "UNSCOM and the UNSCOM Experience in Iraq", ''Politics and the Life Sciences'', Vol. 14, No. 2 (Aug. 1995), 230.&lt;/ref&gt; In the decade following the Gulf War, the United Nations passed 16 Security Council resolutions calling for the complete elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Member states communicated their frustration over the years that Iraq was impeding the work of the special commission and failing to take seriously its disarmament obligations. Iraqi officials harassed the inspectors and obstructed their work,&lt;ref name="Zilinskas"/&gt; and in August 1998 the Iraqi government suspended cooperation with the inspectors completely, alleging that the inspectors were spying for the US.&lt;ref name="Fisk2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Fisk|title=The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jp2mZr7BoGsC|date=18 December 2007|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-42871-4}}   Digital copy, does not include page numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; The spying allegations were later substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = U.S. Spied on Iraq Via U.N.| accessdate = 9 November 2017| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/march99/unscom2.htm|newspaper=Washington Post|date=2 March 1999|author=Barton Gellman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1998, removing the Iraqi government became official [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] with enactment of the [[Iraq Liberation Act]]. The act provided $97&amp;nbsp;million for Iraqi "democratic opposition organizations" to "establish a program to support a transition to democracy in Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4655.ENR: |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711034008/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105%3AH.R.4655.ENR%3A |archivedate=11 July 2008 |title=Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (Enrolled as Agreed to or Passed by Both House and Senate) |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=25 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation contrasted with the terms set out in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687]], which focused on weapons and weapons programs and made no mention of regime change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/news/un/iraq/sres/sres0687.htm |title=Resolution 687 (1991) |accessdate=25 May 2006 |date=8 April 1991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523015627/https://fas.org/news/un/iraq/sres/sres0687.htm |archivedate=23 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One month after the passage of the Iraq Liberation Act, the US and UK launched a bombardment campaign of Iraq called [[Operation Desert Fox]].

With the election of George W. Bush as president in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]], the US moved towards a more aggressive Iraq policy.

Bush began formally making his case to the international community for an invasion of Iraq in his 12 September 2002 address to the [[UN Security Council]].&lt;ref&gt;George W. Bush, [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/09/20020912-1.html "President's Remarks at the United Nations General Assembly:] Remarks by the President in Address to the United Nations General Assembly, New York City", official transcript, press release, [[The White House]], 12 September 2002. Retrieved 24 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Key U.S. allies in [[NATO]], such as the United Kingdom, agreed with the US actions, while France and Germany were critical of plans to invade Iraq, arguing instead for continued diplomacy and weapons inspections. After considerable debate, the UN Security Council adopted a compromise resolution, [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441]], which authorized the resumption of weapons inspections and promised "serious consequences" for non-compliance. Security Council members France and Russia made clear that they did not consider these consequences to include the use of force to overthrow the Iraqi government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2364203.stm "France threatens rival UN Iraq draft"].

Resolution 1441 set up inspections by the [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Saddam accepted the resolution on 13 November and inspectors returned to Iraq under the direction of UNMOVIC chairman [[Hans Blix]] and IAEA Director General [[Mohamed ElBaradei]]. As of February 2003, the IAEA "found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq"; the IAEA concluded that certain items which could have been used in nuclear enrichment centrifuges, such as aluminum tubes, were in fact intended for other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statements of the Director General|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2003/ebsp2003n006.shtml|publisher=IAEA|accessdate=7 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903185204/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2003/ebsp2003n006.shtml|archivedate=3 September 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2003, Blix said progress had been made in inspections, and no evidence of WMD had been found.&lt;ref name="blix1"&gt;Blix, H.

In October 2002, the US Congress passed the "[[Iraq Resolution]]". The resolution authorized the President to "use any means necessary" against Iraq. Americans polled in January 2003 widely favored further diplomacy over an invasion. Later that year, however, Americans began to agree with Bush's plan (see [[popular opinion in the United States on the invasion of Iraq]]). The US government engaged in an elaborate domestic public relations campaign to market the war to its citizens. Americans overwhelmingly believed Saddam did have weapons of mass destruction: 85% said so, even though the inspectors had not uncovered those weapons. By February 2003, 64% of Americans supported taking military action to remove Saddam from power.&lt;ref name="CBSnews-20030124"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/23/opinion/polls/main537739.shtml "Poll: Talk First, Fight Later"].

On 5 February 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell [[United Nations Security Council and the Iraq War#Colin Powell's presentation|appeared before the UN]] to present evidence that Iraq was hiding unconventional weapons. However, Powell's presentation included information based on the claims of [[Curveball (informant)|Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, codenamed "Curveball"]], an Iraqi emigrant living in Germany who later admitted that his claims had been false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lee |last=Ferran |url =http://abcnews.com/Blotter/iraqi-defector-al-janabi-codenamed-curveball-admits-wmd/story?id=12922213 |title =Iraqi Defector 'Curveball' Admits WMD Lies, Is Proud of Tricking U.S. |publisher =ABC News |date =15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powell also presented evidence alleging Iraq had ties to al-Qaeda. As a follow-up to Powell's presentation, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Japan, and Spain proposed a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, but NATO members like Canada, France, and Germany, together with Russia, strongly urged continued diplomacy.

In March 2003, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Australia, Spain, Denmark, and Italy began preparing for the invasion of Iraq with a host of public relations and military moves. In an address to the nation on 17 March 2003, Bush demanded that Saddam and his two sons, [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]], surrender and leave Iraq, giving them a 48-hour deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030317-7.html|title=President Says Saddam Hussein Must Leave Iraq Within 48 Hours|date=17 March 2003 |publisher=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary]]|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] held a debate on going to war on 18 March 2003 where the government motion was approved 412 to 149.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030318/debtext/30318-47.htm |work=Hansard |date=18 March 2003 |volume=401 |issue=365 |title=Division No. 117 (Iraq) |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=29 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote was a key moment in the history of the [[Blair administration]], as the number of government MPs who rebelled against the vote was the greatest since the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846. Three government ministers resigned in protest at the war, [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]], [[Lord Hunt of Kings Heath]], and the then Leader of the House of Commons [[Robin Cook]].

In October 2002, former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] warned about possible dangers of pre-emptive military action against Iraq. Speaking in the UK at a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference he said: "As a preemptive action today, however well-justified, may come back with unwelcome consequences in the future....

In the same period, [[Pope John Paul II]] publicly condemned the military intervention. During a private meeting, he also said directly to George W.

Deputy Defense Secretary [[Paul Wolfowitz]] said Shinseki's estimate was "way off the mark," because other countries would take part in an occupying force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/02/27/sprj.irq.war.cost/ |title=Administration fends off demands for war estimates&amp;nbsp;– Mar. 3, 2003 |publisher=CNN |date= 26 February 2003|accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's Foreign Secretary [[Joschka Fischer]], although having been in favour of stationing German troops in [[Afghanistan]], advised [[Chancellor of Germany|Federal Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schröder|Schröder]] not to join the war in Iraq.

There were serious [[Legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq|legal questions]] surrounding the launching of the war against Iraq and the [[Bush Doctrine]] of [[preemptive war]] in general. On 16 September 2004, [[Kofi Annan]], the Secretary General of the United Nations, said of the invasion, "I have indicated it was not in conformity with the [[UN&amp;nbsp;Charter]]. From our point of view, from the Charter point of view, it was illegal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3661134.stm |title=Iraq war illegal, says Annan

In November 2008 [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Lord Bingham]], the former British [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lord]], described the war as a serious violation of [[international law]], and accused Britain and the United States of acting like a "world [[vigilante]]". He also criticized the post-invasion record of Britain as "an occupying power in Iraq".

According to General Tommy Franks, there were eight objectives of the invasion, "First, ending the regime of Saddam Hussein. Second, to identify, isolate, and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Third, to search for, to capture, and to drive out terrorists from that country. Fourth, to collect such intelligence as we can relate to terrorist networks. Fifth, to collect such intelligence as we can relate to the global network of illicit weapons of mass destruction. Sixth, to end sanctions and to immediately deliver humanitarian support to the displaced and to many needy Iraqi citizens. Seventh, to secure Iraq's [[oil field]]s and resources, which belong to the Iraqi people. And last, to help the Iraqi people create conditions for a transition to a representative self-government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sale|first1= Michelle |last2=Khan|first2= Javid|title=Missions Accomplished?|url= http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/missions-accomplished| accessdate= 25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invasion was a quick and decisive operation encountering major resistance, though not what the U.S., British and other forces expected. The Iraqi regime had prepared to fight both a conventional and irregular war at the same time, conceding territory when faced with superior conventional forces, largely armored, but launching smaller scale attacks in the rear using fighters dressed in civilian and paramilitary clothes.

Coalition troops launched air and [[amphibious assault]] on the [[Al-Faw peninsula]] to secure the oil fields there and the important ports, supported by warships of the [[Royal Navy]], [[Polish Navy]], and [[Royal Australian Navy]]. The [[United States Marine Corps]]' [[15th&amp;nbsp; Marine Expeditionary Unit]], attached to 3&amp;nbsp;Commando Brigade and the Polish Special Forces unit [[GROM]] attacked the port of [[Umm Qasr]], while the [[British Army]]'s [[16&amp;nbsp;Air Assault Brigade]] secured the oil fields in southern Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Keegan|author-link=John Keegan|title=The Iraq War|publisher=Vintage Books|date=2005|isbn=1-4000-7920-9|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Allied Participation in Operation Iraqi Freedom|last=Carney|first=Stephen A.|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|date=2011|url=https://history.army.mil/html/books/059/59-3-1/CMH_59-3-1.pdf|pages=10, 98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April, Baghdad fell, ending Saddam's 24‑year rule.

On 1 May 2003, President Bush visited the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']] operating a few miles west of San Diego, California. At sunset, he held his nationally televised [[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|"Mission Accomplished" speech]]", delivered before the sailors and [[airmen]] on the [[flight deck]]: Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq, due to the defeat of Iraq's conventional forces, while still maintaining that much still needed to be done.

Nevertheless, Saddam Hussein remained at large, and significant pockets of resistance remained. After Bush's speech, coalition forces noticed a flurry of attacks on its troops began to gradually increase in various regions, such as the "[[Sunni Triangle]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Operation Iraqi Freedom Maps|publisher=GlobalSecurity.Org|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraqi_freedom-ops-maps.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial Iraqi insurgents were supplied by hundreds of weapons caches created before the invasion by the Iraqi army and [[Iraqi Special Republican Guard|Republican Guard]].

Initially, Iraqi resistance (described by the coalition as "Anti-Iraqi Forces") largely stemmed from [[fedayeen]] and Saddam/[[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party&amp;nbsp;– Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] loyalists, but soon religious radicals and Iraqis angered by the occupation contributed to the insurgency. The three provinces with the highest number of attacks were [[Baghdad Governorate|Baghdad]], [[Al Anbar Governorate|Al Anbar]], and [[Salah ad Din Governorate|Salah Ad Din]]. Those three provinces account for 35% of the population, but by December 2006 they were responsible for 73% of U.S. military deaths and an even higher percentage of recent U.S. military deaths (about 80%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icasualties.org/oif/Province.aspx|title=iCasualties: Iraq Coalition Casualty Count&amp;nbsp;— Deaths by Province Year/Month|publisher=Icasualties.org|accessdate=27 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708203616/http://icasualties.org/oif/Province.aspx |archivedate = 8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurgents used various [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]], including mortars, missiles, [[suicide attack]]s, [[Juba (sniper)|snipers]], [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs), car bombs, small arms fire (usually with [[assault rifle]]s), and RPGs ([[rocket propelled grenades]]), as well as sabotage against the petroleum, water, and electrical infrastructures.

Coalition efforts to establish [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|post-invasion Iraq]] commenced after the fall of Saddam's regime. The coalition nations, together with the United Nations, began to work to establish a stable, compliant democratic state capable of defending itself from non-coalition forces, as well as overcoming internal divisions.&lt;ref name=Soriano&gt;{{cite news|title=Poll: Iraqis out of patience|work=USA Today|date=30 April 2004|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/1/13/232154.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050116031824/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/1/13/232154.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 January 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mariam |last=Karouny |url = http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=49603 |title =Gloom descends on Iraqi leaders as civil war looms |newspaper=Turkish Daily News |agency=Reuters |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165233/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=49603 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |date =23 July 2006 |deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, coalition military forces launched several operations around the [[Tigris]] River peninsula and in the Sunni Triangle. A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle. Toward late-2003, the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase. A sharp surge in guerrilla attacks ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the "[[Ramadan Offensive (2003)|Ramadan Offensive]]", as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of [[Ramadan]].

To counter this offensive, coalition forces began to use air power and artillery again for the first time since the end of the invasion, by striking suspected ambush sites and mortar launching positions. Surveillance of major routes, patrols, and raids on suspected insurgents were stepped up. In addition, two villages, including Saddam's birthplace of [[al-Auja]] and the small town of [[Abu Hishma]], were surrounded by barbed wire and carefully monitored.

[[File:Iraq 2003 occupation.png|left|thumb|Occupation zones in [[Coalition Provisional Authority|Iraq]] as of September 2003]]
Shortly after the invasion, the multinational coalition created the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA; {{lang-ar|سلطة الائتلاف الموحدة}}), based in the [[Green Zone]], as a [[transitional government]] of Iraq until the establishment of a democratic government. Citing [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483]] (22 May 2003) and the [[laws of war]], the CPA vested itself with executive, [[legislative]], and [[judicial]] authority over the Iraqi government from the period of the CPA's inception on 21 April 2003 until its dissolution on 28 June 2004.

The CPA was originally headed by [[Jay Garner]], a former U.S. military officer, but his appointment lasted only until 11 May 2003, when President Bush appointed [[L.&amp;nbsp;Paul Bremer]]. On 16 May 2003, his first day on the job, Paul Bremer issued [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order 1]] to exclude from the new Iraqi government and administration members of the Baathist party. This policy, known as [[De-Ba'athification]], eventually led to the removal of 85,000 to 100,000 Iraqi people from their job,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Articles/CPA%20Orders,%20Iraq%20PDF.pdf " US Blunders in Iraq" ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129181004/http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Articles/CPA%20Orders%2C%20Iraq%20PDF.pdf |date=29 November 2016 }} "Intelligence and National Security Vol. 25, No. 1, 76–85, February 2010"&lt;/ref&gt; including 40,000 school teachers who had joined the Baath Party simply to keep their jobs. U.S. army general Sanchez called the decision a "catastrophic failure".&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez, Wiser in Battle, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt; Bremer served until the CPA's dissolution in June 2004.

In May 2003, the US Advisor to Iraq Ministry of Defense within the CPA, [[Walter B. Slocombe]] advocated changing the pre-war Bush policy to employ the former Iraq Army after hostilities on the ground ceased.&lt;ref&gt;"Reintegration of Regular [IRAQ] Army", DDR Tasks -- The Army, 03/07/2003 10:03 AM&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, hundreds of thousands of former Iraq soldiers who had not been paid for months were waiting for the CPA to hire them back to work to help secure and rebuild Iraq.  Despite advice from US Military Staff working within the CPA, Bremer met with President Bush, via video conference, and asked for authority to change the U.S. policy.  Bush gave Bremer and Slocombe authority to change the pre-war policy.  Slocombe announced the policy change in the Spring of 2003. The decision led to the alienation of hundreds of thousands of former armed Iraq soldiers, who subsequently aligned themselves with various occupation resistance movements all over Iraq. In the week before the order to dissolve the Iraq Army no coalition forces were killed by hostile action in Iraq.  The week after, five U.S. soldiers were killed.  Then, on June 18, 2003, coalition forces opened fire on former Iraq soldiers protesting in Baghdad, who were throwing rocks at coalition forces.  The policy to disband the Iraq Army was reversed by the CPA only days after it was implemented. But it was too late; the former Iraq Army shifted their alliance from one that was ready and willing to work with the CPA to one of armed resistance against the CPA and the coalition forces.

Another group created by the [[multinational force in Iraq]] post-invasion was the 1,400-member international [[Iraq Survey Group]], who conducted a fact-finding mission to find Iraq weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes. In 2004, the ISG's [[Duelfer Report]] stated that Iraq did not have a viable WMD program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/iraq_wmd_2004/|title=Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the DCI on Iraq's WMD – Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capturing former government leaders====

[[File:Iraqi insurgents with MANPADS.jpg|thumb|Two insurgents in Iraq with SA-7b and SA-14 MANPADS]]

In summer 2003, the multinational forces focused on [[Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards|capturing the remaining leaders]] of the former government. On 22 July, a raid by the U.S.&amp;nbsp;[[101st Airborne Division]] and soldiers from [[Task Force&amp;nbsp;20]] killed Saddam's sons ([[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]]) along with one of his grandsons. In all, over 300 top leaders of the former government were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel.

Most significantly, Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003, on a farm near [[Tikrit]] in [[Operation Red Dawn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pentagon: Saddam is POW|publisher=CNN|date=10 January 2004|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/01/09/sprj.nirq.saddam/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was conducted by the [[United States Army]]'s [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] and members of [[Task Force 121]]. Intelligence on Saddam's whereabouts came from his family members and former bodyguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saddam 'caught like a rat' in a hole|publisher=CNN|date=15 December 2003|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/12/14/sprj.irq.saddam.operation/index.html?iref=newssearch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the capture of Saddam and a drop in the number of insurgent attacks, some concluded the multinational forces were prevailing in the fight against the insurgency. The provisional government began training the new Iraqi security forces intended to police the country, and the United States promised over {{Nowrap|$20 billion}} in reconstruction money in the form of credit against Iraq's future oil revenues. Oil revenue was also used for rebuilding schools and for work on the electrical and refining infrastructure.

Shortly after the capture of Saddam, elements left out of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] began to agitate for elections and the formation of an [[Iraqi Interim Government]]. Most prominent among these was the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] cleric [[Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani]]. The Coalition Provisional Authority opposed allowing democratic elections at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why the U.S. is Running Scared of Elections in Iraq |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=19 January 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/19/usa.iraq|accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insurgents stepped up their activities. The two most turbulent centers were the area around [[Fallujah]] and the poor [[Shia]] sections of cities from [[Baghdad]] ([[Sadr City]]) to [[Basra]] in the south.

The start of 2004 was marked by a relative lull in violence. Insurgent forces reorganised during this time, studying the multinational forces' tactics and planning a renewed offensive. However, violence did increase during the [[Iraq Spring Fighting of 2004]] with foreign fighters from around the Middle East as well as [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]] (an affiliated [[al-Qaeda]] group), led by [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] helping to drive the insurgency.{{Citation needed|reason=What is that about?

[[File:Soldiers firing a M120 120mm mortar (Iraq).jpg|thumbnail|U.S. troops fire mortars]]
As the insurgency grew there was a distinct change in targeting from the coalition forces towards the new Iraqi Security Forces, as hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police were killed over the next few months in a series of massive bombings. An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was becoming more powerful throughout Iraq. The Shia [[Mahdi Army]] also began launching attacks on coalition targets in an attempt to seize control from Iraqi security forces. The southern and central portions of Iraq were beginning to erupt in urban guerrilla combat as multinational forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive.

The most serious fighting of the war so far began on 31 March 2004, when [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Iraqi insurgents]] in [[Fallujah]] ambushed a [[Blackwater&amp;nbsp;USA]] convoy led by four U.S. [[private military contractor]]s who were providing security for food caterers [[Eurest Support Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/warriors/contractors/highrisk.html |title=frontline: private warriors: contractors: the high-risk contracting business |publisher=PBS |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four armed contractors, [[Scott Helvenston]], Jerko Zovko, Wesley Batalona, and Michael Teague, were killed with grenades and small arms fire. Subsequently, their bodies were dragged from their vehicles by local people, beaten, set ablaze, and their burned corpses hung over a bridge crossing the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/03/31/iraq.main/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040406012238/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/03/31/iraq.main/|archivedate=6 April 2004|last1=Flower|first1=Kevin|last2=Gray|first2=Melissa|last3=Kroll|first3=Sue|last4=Paulsen|first4=Vivian|last5=Sadik|first5=Auday|title=U.S. expects more attacks in Iraq: Residents hang slain Americans' bodies from bridge |publisher=CNN |date=31 March 2004|accessdate=6 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Photos of the event were released to [[news agency|news agencies]] worldwide, causing a great deal of indignation and [[moral panic|moral outrage]] in the United States, and prompting an unsuccessful "pacification" of the city: the [[First Battle of Fallujah]] in April 2004.

The offensive was resumed in November 2004 in the bloodiest battle of the war: the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], described by the U.S. military as "the heaviest [[urban warfare|urban combat]] (that they had been involved in) since the [[battle of Hue City]] in Vietnam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://osd.dtic.mil/news/Jan2005/n01112005_2005011103.html ScanEagle Proves Worth in Fallujah Fight] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115202751/http://osd.dtic.mil/news/Jan2005/n01112005_2005011103.html |date=15 January 2016 }}, ''DefenseLINK News''&lt;/ref&gt; During the assault, U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces used [[White phosphorus use in Iraq|white phosphorus]] as an incendiary weapon against insurgent personnel, attracting controversy.

Fallujah was totally devastated during the fighting, though civilian casualties were low, as they had mostly fled before the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Ricks (2006) ''Fiasco'': 398–405&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major event of that year was the revelation of widespread [[prisoner abuse]] at [[Abu Ghraib]], which received international media attention in April 2004. First reports of the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]], as well as graphic pictures showing U.S.&amp;nbsp;military personnel taunting and abusing Iraqi prisoners, came to public attention from a ''[[60&amp;nbsp;Minutes&amp;nbsp;II]]'' news report (28 April) and a [[Seymour M. Hersh]] article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (posted online on 30 April.)&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, S.

Ricks (2006) ''Fiasco, The American Military Adventure in Iraq''. Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;

2004 also marked the beginning of [[Military Transition Teams]] in Iraq, which were teams of U.S. military advisors assigned directly to New Iraqi Army units.

===2005: Elections and transitional government===
{{Further|2005 in Iraq|Military transition team}}
[[File:Baghdad Convention Center inside.jpg|right|thumb|Convention center for Council of Representatives of Iraq]]
On 31 January, Iraqis [[Iraqi legislative election, January 2005|elected]] the [[Iraqi Transitional Government]] in order to draft a permanent constitution. Although some violence and a widespread Sunni [[boycott]] marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated. On 4 February, [[Paul Wolfowitz]] announced that 15,000 U.S.&amp;nbsp;troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. to pull out 15,000 from Iraq|publisher=BBC News|date=4 February 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4235787.stm | accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; February to April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the prior average of 70.

The [[Battle of Abu Ghraib]] on 2 April 2005 was an attack on United States forces at Abu Ghraib prison, which consisted of heavy mortar and rocket fire, under which an estimated 80–120 armed insurgents attacked with grenades, small arms, and two vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED). The U.S. force's munitions ran so low that orders to fix bayonets were given in preparation for hand-to-hand fighting. It was considered to be the largest coordinated assault on a U.S. base since the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Insurgents attack Abu Ghraib prison|date=3 April 2005|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/04/02/iraq.main | accessdate=26 March 2014|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopes for a quick end to the insurgency and a withdrawal of U.S. troops were dashed in May, Iraq's bloodiest month since the invasion. Suicide bombers, believed to be mainly disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs, Syrians and Saudis, tore through Iraq. Their targets were often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations of Shias. As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in that month, as well as 79 U.S. soldiers.

The summer of 2005 saw fighting around [[Baghdad]] and at [[Tall Afar]] in northwestern Iraq as U.S. forces tried to seal off the Syrian border. This led to fighting in the autumn in the small towns of the [[Euphrates]] valley between the capital and that border.&lt;ref name="Ricks-2006"&gt;Thomas Ricks (2006) ''Fiasco'': 413&lt;/ref&gt;

A referendum was held on 15 October in which the new [[Constitution of Iraq|Iraqi constitution]] was [[Iraqi constitutional referendum, 2005|ratified]]. An [[Iraqi National Assembly]] was [[Iraqi legislative election, December 2005|elected in December]], with participation from the Sunnis as well as the Kurds and Shia.&lt;ref name="Ricks-2006"/&gt;

Insurgent attacks increased in 2005 with 34,131 recorded incidents, compared to a total 26,496 for the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Ricks (2006) ''Fiasco'': 414&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of 2006 was marked by government creation talks, growing sectarian violence, and continuous anti-coalition attacks. Sectarian violence expanded to a new level of intensity following the [[al-Askari Mosque bombing (2006)|al-Askari Mosque bombing]] in the Iraqi city of Samarra, on 22 February 2006. The explosion at the mosque, one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam, is believed to have been caused by a bomb planted by al-Qaeda.

Although no injuries occurred in the blast, the mosque was severely damaged and the bombing resulted in violence over the following days. Over 100 dead bodies with bullet holes were found on 23 February, and at least 165 people are thought to have been killed. In the aftermath of this attack the U.S.&amp;nbsp;military calculated that the average homicide rate in [[Baghdad]] tripled from 11 to 33 deaths per day. In 2006 the UN described the environment in Iraq as a "civil war-like situation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Decrying violence in Iraq, UN envoy urges national dialogue, international support|publisher=UN News Centre|date=25 November 2006|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=20726&amp;Cr=Iraq&amp;Cr1=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March, five United States Army soldiers of the [[502nd Infantry Regiment]] raped the 15-year-old Iraqi girl Abeer Qassim Hamza al-Janabi, and then murdered her, her father, her mother Fakhriya Taha Muhasen and her six-year-old sister Hadeel Qassim Hamza al-Janabi.

[[File:Bush and al-Maliki.jpg|thumb|upright|Nouri al-Maliki meets with George W. Bush, June 2006]]
On 6 June 2006, the United States was successful in tracking [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the leader of [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]] who was killed in a [[targeted killing]], while attending a meeting in an isolated safehouse approximately {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Baqubah. Having been tracked by a British UAV, radio contact was made between the controller and two United States Air Force [[F-16]]C jets, which identified the house and at 14:15&amp;nbsp;GMT, the lead jet dropped two 500‑pound (230&amp;nbsp;kg) guided bombs, a laser-guided GBU‑12 and GPS-guided GBU‑38 on the building where he was located. Six others—three male and three female individuals—were also reported killed. Among those killed were one of his wives and their child.

The government of Iraq took office on 20 May 2006, following approval by the [[Members of the 1st Iraqi Council of Representatives|members]] of the [[Iraqi National Assembly]]. This followed the [[Iraqi legislative election, December 2005|general election in December 2005]]. The government succeeded the Iraqi Transitional Government, which had continued in office in a [[caretaker government|caretaker capacity]] until the formation of the permanent government.

====Iraq Study Group report and Saddam's execution====
{{Main|Iraq Study Group|Execution of Saddam Hussein}}

The [[Iraq Study Group Report]] was released on 6 December 2006. The Iraq Study Group, made up of people from both of the major U.S.&amp;nbsp;parties, was led by co-chairs [[James Baker]], a former Secretary of State (Republican), and [[Lee H. Hamilton]], a former U.S.&amp;nbsp;Representative (Democrat). It concluded that "the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating" and "U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces seem to be caught in a mission that has no foreseeable end." The report's 79&amp;nbsp;recommendations include increasing diplomatic measures with [[Iran]] and [[Syria]] and intensifying efforts to train Iraqi troops. On 18 December, a Pentagon report found that insurgent attacks were averaging about 960 attacks per week, the highest since the reports had begun in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Attacks in Iraq at All-Time High, Pentagon Report Says|publisher=PBS|date=19 December 2006|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/july-dec06/iraq_12-19.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalition forces formally transferred control of a province to the Iraqi government, the first since the war. Military prosecutors charged eight U.S. Marines with the murders of 24 Iraqi civilians in [[Haditha]] in November 2005, 10 of them women and children. Four officers were also charged with [[dereliction of duty]] in relation to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marine Officers Charged in Haditha Case|publisher=Washington Post|date=22 December 2006|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122200143_pf.html | first=Thomas | last=Watkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saddam Hussein was hanged on 30 December 2006, after being found guilty of [[crimes against humanity]] by an Iraqi court after a year-long trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saddam Hussein executed in Iraq|publisher=BBC News |date=30 December 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6218485.stm |accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 10 January 2007, televised address to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;public, Bush proposed 21,500 more troops for Iraq, a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion for these programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070110-7.html|title=President's Address to the Nation|date=10 January 2007|publisher=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 January 2007, in the [[2007 State of the Union Address]], Bush announced "deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq".

On 10 February 2007, [[David Petraeus]] was made commander of [[Multinational Force Iraq|Multi-National Force&amp;nbsp;– Iraq]] (MNF-I), the four-star post that oversees all coalition forces in country, replacing General [[George William Casey Jr.|George Casey]]. In his new position, Petraeus oversaw all coalition forces in Iraq and employed them in the new [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|"Surge" strategy]] outlined by the Bush administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John|last=Holusha|title=Petraeus Calls Iraq Situation Dire|work=The New York Times|date=23 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael|last=Gordon|title=Bush to Name a New General to Oversee Iraq|work=The New York Times|date=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Iraqi military spokesman claimed that civilian deaths since the start of the troop surge plan were 265 in Baghdad, down from 1,440 in the four previous weeks. ''[[The New York Times]]'' counted more than 450 Iraqi civilians killed during the same 28‑day period, based on initial daily reports from [[Iraqi Interior Ministry]] and hospital officials.

Historically, the daily counts tallied by ''The New York Times'' have underestimated the total death toll by 50% or more when compared to studies by the United Nations, which rely upon figures from the [[Iraqi Health Ministry]] and morgue figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070315/NEWS/703150441/1052 |title=Baghdad violence decrease debatable |author=Damien Cave |agency=The New York Times |location=Worcester, Mass. |date=15 March 2007 |work=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2007, the [[2007 Qahtaniya bombings|deadliest single attack of the whole war]] occurred. Nearly 800&amp;nbsp;civilians were killed by a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks on the northern Iraqi settlement of [[Kahtaniya]]. More than 100&amp;nbsp;homes and shops were destroyed in the blasts. U.S.&amp;nbsp;officials blamed al‑Qaeda. The targeted villagers belonged to the non-Muslim [[Yazidi]] ethnic minority. The attack may have represented the latest in a feud that erupted earlier that year when members of the Yazidi community stoned to death a teenage girl called [[Du'a Khalil Aswad]] accused of dating a Sunni Arab man and converting to Islam.

Investigative reporter [[Bob Woodward]] cites U.S.&amp;nbsp;government sources according to which the U.S.&amp;nbsp;"surge" was not the primary reason for the drop in violence in 2007–08.

====Political developments====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Congbench.PNG|thumb|right|Official Iraq-benchmark of the Congress, 2007]] --&gt;
More than half of the members of Iraq's parliament rejected the continuing occupation of their country for the first time. 144 of the 275 lawmakers signed onto a legislative petition that would require the Iraqi government to seek approval from Parliament before it requests an extension of the UN mandate for foreign forces to be in Iraq, which expires at the end of 2008. It also calls for a timetable for troop withdrawal and a freeze on the size of foreign forces.

====Tensions with Iran====
{{Further|United States-Iran relations|Karbala provincial headquarters raid}}
In 2007, tensions increased greatly between [[Iran]] and [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] due to the latter's giving sanctuary to the militant Kurdish secessionist group [[Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan]] (PEJAK.) According to reports, Iran had been shelling PEJAK positions in Iraqi Kurdistan since 16 August. These tensions further increased with an alleged border incursion on 23 August by Iranian troops who attacked several Kurdish villages killing an unknown number of civilians and militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins |first=Chris |author2=Yaseen Taha |title=Iranians attack Kurdish rebels in Iraq |publisher=McClatchy Washington Bureau |date=23 August 2007 |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/iraq/story/19172.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703071530/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/iraq/story/19172.html |archivedate=3 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalition forces also [[Kill or Capture strategy|began to target]] alleged Iranian [[Quds force]] operatives in Iraq, either [[U.S. raid on the Iranian Liaison Office in Arbil|arresting or killing suspected members]]. The Bush administration and coalition leaders began to publicly state that Iran was supplying weapons, particularly [[Explosively formed penetrator|EFP]] devices, to Iraqi insurgents and militias although to date have failed to provide any proof for these allegations. Further sanctions on Iranian organizations were also announced by the Bush administration in the autumn of 2007. On 21 November 2007, Lieutenant General James Dubik, who is in charge of training Iraqi security forces, praised Iran for its "contribution to the reduction of violence" in Iraq by upholding its pledge to stop the flow of weapons, explosives and training of extremists in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gyE_23JcWcBZt06lpBqxSXqpkOXg|title=US general says Iran helping stop Iraq bloodshed|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=21 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527151841/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gyE_23JcWcBZt06lpBqxSXqpkOXg|archivedate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tensions with Turkey====

Border incursions by [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] militants based in Northern Iraq have continued to harass Turkish forces, with casualties on both sides.

{{Further|2008 in Iraq}}

[[File:080216 3-14 graduation.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers of the 3rd Brigade, 14th Iraqi Army division graduate from basic training.]]

Throughout 2008, U.S.&amp;nbsp;officials and independent think tanks began to point to improvements in the security situation, as measured by key statistics. According to the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Defense Department]], in December 2008 the "overall level of violence" in the country had dropped 80% since before [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|the surge]] began in January 2007, and the country's murder rate had dropped to prewar levels. They also pointed out that the casualty figure for U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces in 2008 was 314 against a figure of 904 in 2007.&lt;ref name="DecDefLink"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=52539 |title=U.S.&amp;nbsp;Deaths in Iraq Decrease in 2008 |publisher=Defenselink.mil |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Brookings Institution]], Iraqi civilian fatalities numbered 490 in November 2008 as against 3,500 in January 2007, whereas attacks against the coalition numbered somewhere between 200 and 300 per week in the latter half of 2008, as opposed to a peak of nearly 1,600 in summer 2007. The number of Iraqi security forces killed was under 100 per month in the second half of 2008, from a high of 200 to 300 in summer 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Centers/saban/iraq-index/index20081120.PDF "''Iraq Index: Tracking Variables of Reconstruction and Security in Post-Saddam Iraq''"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081442/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Centers/saban/iraq-index/index20081120.PDF |date=4 March 2016 }}, [[Brookings Institution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the proficiency of the Iraqi military increased as it launched a spring offensive against Shia militias, which Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] had previously been criticized for allowing to operate. This began with a March [[Battle of Basra (2008)|operation]] against the [[Mehdi Army]] in Basra, which led to fighting in Shia areas up and down the country, especially in the [[Sadr City]] district of Baghdad. By October, the British officer in charge of Basra said that since the operation the town had become "secure" and had a murder rate comparable to [[Manchester]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4304 "DoD News Briefing with Maj.

At the end of March, the Iraqi Army, with Coalition air support, launched an offensive, dubbed "Charge of the Knights", in Basra to secure the area from militias. This was the first major operation where the Iraqi Army did not have direct combat support from conventional coalition ground troops. The offensive was opposed by the [[Mahdi Army]], one of the militias, which controlled much of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dagher|first=Sam|title=Across Iraq, battles erupt with Mahdi Army|work=The Christian Science Monitor|date=26 March 2008|page=2|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0326/p01s13-woiq.html?page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=driveinbasra&gt;{{cite news |author=Stephen Farrell and Ahmar Karim|title=Drive in Basra by Iraqi Army Makes Gains|work=The New York Times|date=12 May 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/world/middleeast/12basra.html?ref=middleeast|accessdate=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting quickly spread to other parts of Iraq: including [[Sadr City]], [[Al Kut]], [[Al Hillah]] and others.

Speaking before the Congress on 8 April 2008, General [[David Petraeus]] urged delaying troop withdrawals, saying, "I've repeatedly noted that we haven't turned any corners, we haven't seen any lights at the end of the tunnel," referencing the comments of then President Bush and former Vietnam-era General [[William Westmoreland]].&lt;ref&gt;Zremski, J.

"This palace is the symbol of Iraqi sovereignty and by restoring it, a real message is directed to all Iraqi people that Iraqi sovereignty has returned to its natural status", al‑Maliki said.

The U.S.&amp;nbsp;military attributed a decline in reported civilian deaths to several factors including the U.S.‑led "troop surge", the growth of U.S.-funded [[Sunni Awakening|Awakening Councils]], and Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's call for his militia to abide by a cease fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/31/iraq.civilians/index.html?iref=newssearch |title=Iraqi civilian deaths down in January |publisher=CNN |date=31 January 2009 |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coalition forces withdraw====
On 30 April, the United Kingdom formally ended combat operations. Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] characterized the operation in Iraq as a "success story" because of UK troops' efforts. Britain handed control of Basra to the United States Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8026136.stm |title=UK combat operations end in Iraq |publisher=BBC News |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July, Australia withdrew its combat forces as the Australian military presence in Iraq ended, per an agreement with the Iraqi government.

The withdrawal of U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces began at the end of June, with 38 bases to be handed over to Iraqi forces. On 29 June 2009, U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces withdrew from Baghdad.

On 30 June and 11 December 2009, the [[Ministry of Oil (Iraq)|Iraqi ministry of oil]] awarded contracts to international oil companies for some of [[Economy of Iraq#2009 Oil services contracts|Iraq's many oil fields]].

On 17 February 2010, U.S.&amp;nbsp;Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] announced that as of 1 September, the name "Operation Iraqi Freedom" would be replaced by "Operation New Dawn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 February 2010 |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/02/exclusive-war-in-iraq-to-be-given-new-name.html |title=Exclusive: War in Iraq to Be Given New Name |publisher=ABC News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220213117/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/02/exclusive-war-in-iraq-to-be-given-new-name.html |archivedate=20 February 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 April, U.S. and Iraqi forces killed [[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]] the leader of [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]] in a joint American and Iraqi operation near [[Tikrit]], Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/04/19/iraqi-al-qaeda-leader-killed-countrys-intelligence-team-pm-maliki-says/ "2 Most Wanted Al Qaeda Leaders in Iraq Killed by U.S., Iraqi Forces"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701141957/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/04/19/iraqi-al-qaeda-leader-killed-countrys-intelligence-team-pm-maliki-says/ |date=1 July 2015}} Fox News, 19 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition forces believed al-Masri to be wearing a suicide vest and proceeded cautiously. After the lengthy exchange of fire and bombing of the house, the Iraqi troops stormed inside and found two women still alive, one of whom was al-Masri's wife, and four dead men, identified as al-Masri, [[Abu Abdullah al-Rashid al-Baghdadi]], an assistant to al-Masri, and al-Baghdadi's son. A suicide vest was indeed found on al-Masri's corpse, as the Iraqi Army subsequently stated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rss.msnbc.msn.com/id/36664251/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/ "US : Al-Qaida in Iraq warlord slain"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113100011/http://rss.msnbc.msn.com/id/36664251/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/ |date=13 November 2016}} MSNBC, 20 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Iraqi Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] announced the killings of Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri at a news conference in Baghdad and showed reporters photographs of their bloody corpses. "The attack was carried out by ground forces which surrounded the house, and also through the use of missiles," Mr Maliki said. "During the operation computers were seized with e-mails and messages to the two biggest terrorists, Osama bin Laden and [his deputy] Ayman al-Zawahiri", Maliki added. U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces commander Gen. [[Raymond Odierno]] praised the operation. "The death of these terrorists is potentially the most significant blow to al‑Qaeda in Iraq since the beginning of the insurgency", he said. "There is still work to do but this is a significant step forward in ridding Iraq of terrorists."

U.S. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] stated that the deaths of the top two al‑Qaeda figures in Iraq are "potentially devastating" blows to the terror network there and proof that Iraqi security forces are gaining ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8630213.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Iraqi al-Qaeda leaders 'killed' |date=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June, Iraq's Central Bank was bombed in an attack that left 15 people dead and brought much of downtown Baghdad to a standstill. The attack was claimed to have been carried out by the [[Islamic State of Iraq]]. This attack was followed by another attack on Iraq's Bank of Trade building that killed 26 and wounded 52 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/world/middleeast/21iraq.html |title=Car Bombs Hit Crowds Outside Bank in Baghdad |first1=Khalid D.|last1=Ali|first2=Timothy|last2=Williams |date=20 June 2010 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2010, insurgents conducted [[25 August 2010 Iraq bombings|a major attack]] with at least 12 car bombs simultaneously detonating from Mosul to Basra and killing at least 51. These attacks coincided with the U.S. plans for a withdrawal of combat troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/world/middleeast/26iraq.html?_r=1&amp;hp |work=The New York Times |title=Insurgents Assert Their Strength With Wave of Bombings Across Iraq |first=Anthony |last=Shadid |date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of August 2010, the United States attempted to dramatically cut its combat role in Iraq, with the withdrawal of all U.S.&amp;nbsp;ground forces designated for active combat operations. [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq#The events of August 19, 2010|The last U.S. combat brigades departed Iraq in the early morning of 19 August]]. Convoys of U.S. troops had been moving out of Iraq to [[Kuwait]] for several days, and [[NBC&amp;nbsp;News]] broadcast live from Iraq as the last convoy crossed the border. While all combat brigades left the country, an additional 50,000 personnel (including Advise and Assist Brigades) remained in the country to provide support for the Iraqi military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38744453/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/|publisher=MSNBC|title=U.S. ending combat operations in Iraq|date=18 August 2010|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/08/201081818840122963.html|title=U.S. ends combat operations in Iraq|publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=18 August 2010|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These troops are required to leave Iraq by 31 December 2011 under an [[U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement|agreement]] between the U.S.&amp;nbsp;and Iraqi governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Final U.S. combat brigade pulls out of Iraq|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/18/AR2010081805644.html?sid=ST2010081805662|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=19 August 2010|date=18 August 2010 |first=Ernesto |last=Londoño}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire to step back from an active counter-insurgency role did not however mean that the Advise and Assist Brigades and other remaining U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces would not be caught up in combat. A standards memo from the Associated Press reiterated "combat in Iraq is not over, and we should not uncritically repeat suggestions that it is, even if they come from senior officials".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/03/ap-memo-iraq-war_n_705446.html |title=AP Issues Standards Memo: 'Combat In Iraq Is Not Over' |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=3 September 2010|accessdate=23 October 2010 |first=Jason |last=Linkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State Department spokesman P.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;Crowley stated "... we are not ending our work in Iraq, We have a long-term commitment to Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11020270|title=Last U.S.&amp;nbsp;combat brigade exits Iraq|publisher=BBC News|date=19 August 2010|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 August, Obama announced the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom from the Oval Office. In his address, he covered the role of the United States' soft power, the effect the war had on the United States economy, and the legacy of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/world/01obama-text.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=world |work=The New York Times |title=President Obama's Address on Iraq |date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day in Iraq, at a ceremony at one of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s former residences at [[Al Faw Palace]] in Baghdad, a number of U.S.&amp;nbsp;dignitaries spoke in a ceremony for television cameras, avoiding overtones of the [[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|triumphalism]] present in U.S. announcements made earlier in the war. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] expressed concerns regarding the ongoing lack of progress in forming a new Iraqi government, saying of the Iraqi people that "they expect a government that reflects the results of the votes they cast". Gen. [[Ray Odierno]] stated that the new era "in no way signals the end of our commitment to the people of Iraq". Speaking in [[Ramadi]] earlier in the day, Gates said that U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces "have accomplished something really quite extraordinary here, [but] how it all weighs in the balance over time I think remains to be seen". When asked by reporters if the seven-year war was worth doing, Gates commented that "It really requires a historian's perspective in terms of what happens here in the long run". He noted the Iraq War "will always be clouded by how it began" regarding Saddam Hussein's supposed [[weapons of mass destruction]], which were never confirmed to have existed. Gates continued, "This is one of the reasons that this war remains so controversial at home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/world/middleeast/02iraq.html?hp|work=The New York Times |title=U.S. Formally Begins a New Era in Iraq |first=Michael |last=Gordon |date=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day Gen. [[Ray Odierno]] was replaced by [[Lloyd Austin]] as Commander of U.S. forces in Iraq.

It was speculated that the militant group responsible for the attack was the same one which attacked JSS Loyalty just over three weeks before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13976476|title=Three U.S. soldiers killed in southern Iraq|publisher=BBC News | date=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the three deaths, June 2011, became the bloodiest month in Iraq for the U.S.&amp;nbsp;military since June 2009, with 15 U.S.&amp;nbsp;soldiers killed, only one of them outside combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/30/501364/main20075656.shtml |title=June bloodiest month for U.S. in Iraq in 2 years |publisher=CBS News |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July, two U.S.&amp;nbsp;troops were killed and one seriously injured in a IED attack at Victory Base Complex outside Baghdad.

In September, Iraq signed a contract to buy 18 Lockheed Martin F-16 warplanes, becoming the 26th nation to operate the F-16. Because of windfall profits from oil, the Iraqi government is planning to double this originally planned 18, to 36 F-16s. Iraq is relying on the U.S.&amp;nbsp;military for air support as it rebuilds its forces and battles a stubborn Islamist insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iraq to buy US warplanes worth around $3&amp;nbsp;billion|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44681548/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/#.ToHJrOxE5_A |publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the collapse of the discussions about extending the stay of any U.S.&amp;nbsp;troops beyond 2011, where they would not be granted any immunity from the Iraqi government, on 21 October 2011, President Obama announced at a White House press conference that all remaining U.S.&amp;nbsp;troops and trainers would leave Iraq by the end of the year as previously scheduled, bringing the U.S.&amp;nbsp;mission in Iraq to an end.&lt;ref name="LeaveIn2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=Barack Obama: All U.S. troops to leave Iraq in 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15410154|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=21 October 2011|date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last American soldier to die in Iraq before the withdrawal was killed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad on 14 November.&lt;ref name=cnndec16&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson|first=Craig|title=N.C. soldier reportedly last to die in Iraq war|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/16/n-c-soldier-reportedly-last-to-die-in-iraq-war/|accessdate=16 December 2011|publisher=CNN|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invasion and occupation led to sectarian violence which caused widespread displacement among Iraqi civilians. The Iraqi Red Crescent organization estimated the total internal displacement was around 2.3&amp;nbsp;million in 2008, with as many as 2 million Iraqis having left the country. Poverty led many Iraqi women to turn to prostitution to support themselves and their families, attracting sex tourists from regional lands. The invasion led to a constitution which supported democracy as long as laws did not violate traditional Islamic principles, and a parliamentary election was held in 2005. In addition the invasion preserved the autonomy of the Kurdish region, and stability brought new economic prosperity. Because the Kurdish region is historically the most democratic area of Iraq, many Iraqi refugees from other territories fled into the Kurdish land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DeFronzo |first=James |editor=Karl Yambert |chapter=Impacts of the Iraq War |title=The Contemporary Middle East |edition=Third |location=Boulder, Colorado |publisher=Westview Press |year=2012 |pages=210–211 |isbn=978-0813348391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iraqi insurgency (post-U.S. withdrawal)|Iraqi insurgency]] surged in the aftermath of the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|U.S.&amp;nbsp;withdrawal]] as insurgent groups, primarily radical Sunni, fought against the central government.  Some 1,000 people were killed across Iraq within the first two months after U.S.&amp;nbsp;withdrawal.

Sectarian violence continued in the first half of 2013. At least 56 people died in April when a Sunni protest in Hawija was interrupted by a government-supported helicopter raid and a series of violent incidents occurred in May. On 20 May 2013, at least 95 people died in a wave of car bomb attacks that was preceded by a car bombing on 15 May that led to 33 deaths; also, on 18 May, 76 people were killed in the Sunni areas of Baghdad. Some experts have stated that Iraq could return to the brutal sectarian conflict of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is Iraq heading toward civil war?|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/244677/is-iraq-heading-toward-civil-war |work=The Week |accessdate=28 May 2013|author=Keith Wagstaff|date=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Attacks Kill 95 in Iraq, Hint of Syrian Spillover |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/iraq-car-bombs-basra-kill-least-10-people|accessdate=28 May 2013|publisher=Associated Press|date=20 May 2013|author=Sinan Salaheddin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 2013, at least five hundred convicts, most of whom were senior members of al-Qaida who had received death sentences, broke out of Iraq's Abu Ghraib jail when comrades launched a military-style assault to free them. The attack began when a suicide bomber drove a car packed with explosives into prison gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/22/iraq-prison-attacks-kill-dozens |title=Iraq: hundreds escape from Abu Ghraib jail |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=19 January 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; James F. Jeffrey, the United States ambassador in Baghdad when the last American troops exited, said the assault and resulting escape "will provide seasoned leadership and a morale boost to Al Qaeda and its allies in both Iraq and Syria ... it is likely to have an electrifying impact on the Sunni population in Iraq, which has been sitting on the fence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/world/middleeast/al-qaeda-asserts-responsibility-for-iraqi-prison-breaks.html |title=Brazen Attacks at Prisons Raise Worries of Al Qaeda's Strength in Iraq |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Michael R.

By mid-2014 the country was in chaos with a new government yet to be formed following national elections, and the insurgency reaching new heights. In early June 2014 the [[Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS) took over the cities of Mosul and Tikrit and said it was ready to march on Baghdad, while Iraqi Kurdish forces took control of key military installations in the major oil city of Kirkuk. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked his parliament to declare a state of emergency that would give him increased powers, but the lawmakers refused.&lt;ref name="IraqImploding"&gt;{{cite news |title=Iraq crisis: Isis gains strength near Baghdad as Kurdish forces seize Kirkuk|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/12/crisis-in-iraq-insurgents-take-major-cities-live-blog|accessdate=12 June 2014|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2014, President Obama announced the return of U.S. forces to Iraq, but only in the form of aerial support, in an effort to halt the advance of ISIS forces, render humanitarian aid to stranded refugees and stabilize the political situation.&lt;ref name="AirSupport"&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama Authorizes Air Strikes in Iraq|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/middleeast/obama-weighs-military-strikes-to-aid-trapped-iraqis-officials-say.html?_r=0|date=8 August 2014|accessdate=22 August 2014|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 August 2014, Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] succumbed to pressure at home and abroad to step down. This paved the way for [[Haidar al-Abadi]] to take over on 19 August 2014. A [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017)|civil war]] between ISIS and the central government continued for the next three years, until the government declared victory in December 2017.&lt;ref name="end of war"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mostafa |first=Nehal |date=9 December 2017 |title=Iraq announces end of war against IS, liberation of borders with Syria: Abadi |url=https://www.iraqinews.com/iraq-war/iraq-announces-end-war-liberation-borders-syria-abadi/ |work=Iraqi News |access-date=9 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2018, violence in Iraq was at its lowest level in ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdobs.com/archive/featured/violence-in-iraq-at-lowest-level-in-10-years/|title=Violence in Iraq at Lowest Level in 10 years|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bush Administration's [[rationale for the Iraq War]] has faced heavy criticism from an array of popular and official sources both inside and outside the United States, with many U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizens finding many parallels with the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam war-eyewitness booksW.; ''Iraq and Vietnam: Differences, Similarities and Insights'', (2004: Strategic Studies Institute)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a former CIA officer described the [[Office of Special Plans]] as a group of [[ideologue]]s who were dangerous to U.S. national security and a threat to world peace, and stated that the group lied and manipulated intelligence to further its agenda of removing Saddam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20030608/ai_n12583062 "Revealed: The Secret Cabal Which Spun for Blair,"] ''Sunday Herald'', Neil Mackay, 8 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Public Integrity]] alleges that the [[George W.

Both proponents and [[Opposition to the Iraq War|opponents]] of the invasion have also criticized the prosecution of the war effort along a number of other lines. Most significantly, critics have assailed the United States and its allies for not devoting enough troops to the mission, not adequately planning for [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|post-invasion Iraq]], and for permitting and perpetrating human rights abuses. As the war has progressed, critics have also railed against the high human and financial costs.  In 2016, the United Kingdom published the [[Iraq Inquiry]], a public inquiry which was broadly critical of the actions of the British government and military in making the case for the war, in tactics and in planning for the aftermath of the war.&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-crushing-verdict-tony-blair-iraq-war|title=Chilcot delivers crushing verdict on Blair and the Iraq war |author=Luke Harding|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TelegraphReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/06/chilcot-inquiry-judgement-day-for-tony-blair-as-iraq-war-report/|title=Chilcot report: 2003 Iraq war was 'unnecessary', invasion was not 'last resort' and Saddam Hussein was 'no imminent threat'|author=Leon Watson|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|newspaper=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36721645|title=Chilcot report: Findings at a glance|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After President Barack Obama was inaugurated in 2009, some anti-war groups decided to stop protesting even though the war was still going on. Some of them decided to stop because they felt they should give the new President time to establish his administration, and others stopped because they believed that Obama would end the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesheraldonline.com/news/ci_11958430 After six years, peace vigil ends], ''Times-Herald'', 20 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial cost===
In March 2013, the total cost of the Iraq War to date was estimated at $1.7&amp;nbsp;trillion by the Watson Institute of International Studies at [[Brown University]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the total cost of the war to the U.S. economy will range from $3&amp;nbsp;trillion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Trotta | first=Daniel | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN2921527420080302 | title=Iraq war hits U.S. economy: Nobel winner | agency=Reuters | date= 2 March 2008 | accessdate=2018-01-16 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012124052/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-iraq/iraq-war-hits-u-s-economy-nobel-winner-idUSN2921527420080302 | archive-date=2017-10-12 | dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; to {{Nowrap|$6 trillion}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Trotta | first=Daniel | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/14/us-iraq-war-anniversary-idUSBRE92D0PG20130314 | title=Iraq war costs US more than $2&amp;nbsp;trillion: study | agency=Reuters | date=14 March 2013 | accessdate=2018-01-16 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919024821/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-war-anniversary/iraq-war-costs-u-s-more-than-2-trillion-study-idUSBRE92D0PG20130314 | archive-date=2017-09-19 | dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; including interest rates, by 2053, as described in the Watson Institute's report. The upper ranges of these estimates include long-term veterans costs and economic impacts. For example, Harvard's public finance expert Linda J.

A [[CNN]] report noted that the United States-led interim government, the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] lasting until 2004 in Iraq had lost $8.8&amp;nbsp;billion in the [[Development Fund for Iraq]]. In June 2011, it was reported by CBS News that $6&amp;nbsp;billion in neatly packaged blocks of $100&amp;nbsp;bills was air-lifted into Iraq by the George W. Bush administration, which flew it into Baghdad aboard C‑130 military cargo planes. In total, the ''Times'' says $12&amp;nbsp;billion in cash was flown into Iraq in 21 separate flights by May 2004, all of which has disappeared. An inspector general's report mentioned that "'Severe inefficiencies and poor management' by the Coalition Provisional Authority would leave no guarantee that the money was properly used", said Stuart W. Bowen,&amp;nbsp;Jr., director of the [[Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction]]. "The CPA did not establish or implement sufficient managerial, financial and contractual controls to ensure that funds were used in a transparent manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/01/30/iraq.audit/ Audit: U.S. lost track of {{Nowrap|$9 billion}} in Iraq funds] Monday, 31 January 2005.

The Foreign Policy Association reported that "Perhaps the most perplexing component of the Iraq refugee crisis ... has been the inability for the United States to absorb more Iraqis following the 2003 invasion of the country. To date, the United States has granted around 84,000 Iraqis refugee status, of the more than two million global Iraqi refugees.

In 2006 it was found that majorities in the UK and Canada believed that the war in Iraq was "unjustified" and&amp;nbsp;– in the UK&amp;nbsp;– were critical of their government's support of U.S.&amp;nbsp;policies in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/pdfs/2006_july_guardian_july_poll.pdf |title=Guardian July Poll |date=July 2006 |publisher=ICM Research |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527234221/http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/pdfs/2006_july_guardian_july_poll.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to polls conducted by the [[Arab American Institute]], four years after the invasion of Iraq, 83% of Egyptians had a negative view of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;role in Iraq; 68% of Saudi Arabians had a negative view; 96% of the Jordanian population had a negative view; 70% of the population of the United Arab Emirates and 76% of the Lebanese population also described their view as negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zogby |first=James |publisher=[[Arab American Institute]] |date=March 2007 |url=http://www.aaiusa.org/page/-/Polls/2007_poll_four_years_later_arab_opinion.pdf |title=Four Years Later: Arab Opinion Troubled by Consequences of Iraq War |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128061143/http://www.aaiusa.org/page/-/Polls/2007_poll_four_years_later_arab_opinion.pdf |archivedate=28 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Global Attitudes Project reports that in 2006 majorities in the [[Netherlands]], (Germany), [[Jordan]], France, [[Lebanon]], Russia, China, Canada, [[Poland]], [[Pakistan]], Spain, [[Indonesia]], [[Turkey]], and [[Morocco]] believed the world was safer before the Iraq War and the toppling of Saddam, while pluralities in the United States and [[India]] believe the world is safer without Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Pew Research Center|work=Pew Global Attitudes Project|date=28 February 2006|url=http://pewglobal.org/commentary/display.php?AnalysisID=1002|title=India: Pro-America, Pro-Bush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though explicitly stating that Iraq had "nothing" to do with 9/11,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= [[Office of the Federal Register]] |year= 2010 |title= Administration of George W.

Bush consistently referred to the Iraq war as "the central front in the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]]", and argued that if the United States pulled out of Iraq, "terrorists will follow us here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bush|first=President George W.|publisher=The White House|date=9 September 2003|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030909.html|title=A Central Front in the War on Terror}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garamone |first=Jim |publisher=American Forces Press Service |date=19 September 2002 |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Sep2002/n09192002_200209194.html |title=Iraq Part of Global War on Terrorism, Rumsfeld Says |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929203848/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Sep2002/n09192002_200209194.html |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bush|first=President George W.|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/08/20060821.html|title=Press Conference by the President|date=21 August 2006|work=Peace in the Middle East|publisher=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other proponents of the war regularly echoed this assertion, as the conflict dragged on, members of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Congress, the U.S.&amp;nbsp;public, and even U.S.&amp;nbsp;troops questioned the connection between Iraq and the fight against anti-U.S.&amp;nbsp;terrorism. In particular, a consensus developed among intelligence experts that the Iraq war actually increased terrorism. [[Counterterrorism]] expert [[Rohan Gunaratna]] frequently referred to the invasion of Iraq as a "fatal mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunaratna|first=Rohan|title=The Post-Madrid Face of Al Qaeda|journal=Washington Quarterly|volume=27|issue=3|date=Summer 2004|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/016366004323090278|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128070821/http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/016366004323090278|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-01-28|doi=10.1162/016366004323090278|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London's [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] concluded in 2004 that the occupation of Iraq had become "a potent global recruitment pretext" for [[Mujahideen]] and that the invasion "galvanised" al-Qaeda and "perversely inspired insurgent violence" there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sengupta |first=Kim |title=Occupation Made World Less Safe, Pro-War Institute Says |work=[[The Independent]] |date=26 May 2004 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0526-05.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920050852/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0526-05.htm |archivedate=20 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Intelligence Council]] concluded in a January 2005 report that the war in Iraq had become a breeding ground for a new generation of terrorists; David Low, the national intelligence officer for transnational threats, indicated that the report concluded that the war in Iraq provided terrorists with "a training ground, a recruitment ground, the opportunity for enhancing technical skills&amp;nbsp;... There is even, under the best scenario, over time, the likelihood that some of the jihadists who are not killed there will, in a sense, go home, wherever home is, and will therefore disperse to various other countries." The Council's chairman [[Robert Hutchings]] said, "At the moment, Iraq is a magnet for international terrorist activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Priest|first=Dana|title=Iraq New Terror Breeding Ground|work=The Washington Post|date=14 January 2005|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7460-2005Jan13.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the 2006 [[National Intelligence Estimate]], which outlined the considered judgment of all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, held that "The Iraq conflict has become the 'cause célèbre' for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of U.S. involvement in the [[Muslim world]] and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Declassified Key Judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate "Trends in Global Terrorism: Implications for the United States" |publisher=Office of the Director of National Intelligence |date=April 2006 |url=http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/Declassified_NIE_Key_Judgments.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930220648/http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/Declassified_NIE_Key_Judgments.pdf |archivedate=30 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of China and Russia ===
As an ally of Iraq, Russia was opposed to the invasion of Iraq. The foreign ministers of Russia, France and Germany made a joint declaration that they will "not allow" passage of a [[United Nations Security Council and the Iraq War|UN Security Council]] resolution authorising war against Iraq. Russia gave information to Saddam's government about the Bush administration's plans. The information included troop deployments, equipment, and their locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-provided-iraq-with-details-of-the-uss-planned-invasion-in-2003-2016-4|title=Russia provided Iraq with details of the US's planned invasion in 2003|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Chinese and Russian governments opposed the Iraq War, both China and Russia have benefited from the Iraq War while suffering none of the losses incurred by the countries that invaded. Two of the biggest Iraqi oil contracts went to China and Russia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1948787,00.html|title=U.S. Companies Shut Out as Iraq Auctions Its Oil Fields|first=Vivienne|last=Walt|date=19 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2017|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the war itself allowed China to present itself as an alternative source of investment to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rubincenter.org/2014/09/ten-years-later-who-won-the-iraq-war-the-us-or-china/|title=TEN YEARS LATER:  WHO WON THE IRAQ WAR, THE US OR CHINA?|website=www.rubincenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iranian involvement===
Although some military intelligence analysts have concluded there is no concrete evidence, U.S. Major General Rick Lynch has claimed that Iran has provided training, weapons, money, and intelligence to Shiite insurgents in Iraq and that up to 150 Iranian intelligence agents, plus members of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] are believed to be active in Iraq at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Troops Authorized to Kill Iranian Operatives in Iraq |first=Dafna |last=Linzer |date=26 January 2007 |page=A.1 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012502199.html |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/19/AR2007081901394.html |title=Iran Trains Militiamen Inside Iraq, U.S. Says |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=20 August 2007|accessdate=23 October 2010 |first=Megan |last=Greenwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch thinks that members of the IRGC's [[Quds Force]] have trained members of the Qazali terror network in explosives technology and also provided the network with arms, munitions, and military advisors. Many explosive devices, including improvised explosives ([[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]) and explosively-formed projectiles (EFPs), used by insurgents are claimed by Lynch to be Iranian-made or designed.

According to two unnamed U.S.&amp;nbsp;officials, [[the Pentagon]] is examining the possibility that the [[Karbala provincial headquarters raid]], in which insurgents managed to infiltrate an American base, kill five U.S.&amp;nbsp;soldiers, wound three, and destroy three humvees before fleeing, was supported by Iranians. In a speech on {{Nowrap|31 January 2007}}, Iraqi Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] stated that Iran was supporting attacks against Coalition forces in Iraq&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Al-Maliki: Iraq won't be battleground for U.S., Iran |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/01/31/iraq.main/ |publisher=CNN |date=31 January 2007 |accessdate=31 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202013010/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/01/31/iraq.main/ |archivedate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some Iraqis suspect that the raid may have been perpetrated by the Quds Force in retaliation for the detention of five Iranian officials by U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces in the northern Iraqi city of [[Irbil]] on {{Nowrap|11 January}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran involvement suspected in Karbala compound attack |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/01/30/iraq.main/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=31 January 2007 |accessdate=31 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Baer |authorlink=Robert Baer |title=Are the Iranians Out for Revenge? |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1583523,00.html?cnn=yes |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=30 January 2007 |accessdate=31 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, U.S. ambassador [[James Franklin Jeffrey]] stated "that Iranian proxies accounted for roughly a quarter of US combat casualties in Iraq—around 1,100 deaths and many thousands more injuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chulov|first=Martin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/28/qassem-suleimani-iran-iraq-influence|title=Qassem Suleimani: the Iranian general 'secretly running' Iraq|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately criticised by the British press for her perceived lack of decorum and intelligence,&lt;ref name="urt"&gt;{{cite book|author=Holmes, Su: Jermyn, Deborah|date=2003|title=Understanding Reality Television|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qyK20eYiz3oC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=%22jade+goody%22+%22notoriously+unpopular%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9lWKN60Pli&amp;sig=5D11I10qBvMXEfy7E6Hz9tdHuYc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTguaThbDSAhXoIsAKHSWzANIQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jade%20goody%22%20%22notoriously%20unpopular%22&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=125|isbn=978-0415317955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goody was dubbed by multiple outlets as "the most hated woman in Britain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/the-jade-goody-phenomenon-5542408.html|title=The Jade Goody phenomenon|date=9 January 2007|website=[[The Independent]]|access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's celebrity magazines were less derisive, publishing reports of her affable nature and competent school performance from those who knew her.&lt;ref name="urt"/&gt; Public opinion of Goody reached its most negative in January 2007, however, when she was accused of [[Celebrity Big Brother racism controversy|racially bullying]] [[Indian people|Indian]] actress [[Shilpa Shetty]] while appearing as a housemate on ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5]]''.&lt;ref name="toi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Why-Jade-Goody-matters/articleshow/4360932.cms?|title=Why Jade Goody matters|date=5 April 2009|website=[[The Times of India]]|access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/20/raceintheuk.bigbrother |title=Jade evicted as poll reveals public anger with Channel 4 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=22 February 2009 | location=London | first=Karen | last=McVeigh | date=22 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her eviction, Goody made a number of apologies,&lt;ref name=imnotracist/&gt; but continued to garner negative public reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Socialite recognised for her true talent |url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/celeb_news/SEE_VIDEO_Paris_Hilton_named_Most_Pointless_Celebrity_article_165779.html |work=[[Now (UK magazine)|Now magazine]] |date=1 December 2007 |accessdate=13 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208174743/http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/celeb_news/SEE_VIDEO_Paris_Hilton_named_Most_Pointless_Celebrity_article_165779.html |archivedate=8 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jade Goody and Pete Doherty top worst dinner party guest list|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/entertainment-news/2008/04/10/jade-goody-and-pete-doherty-top-worst-dinner-party-guest-list-86908-20378005/ |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |date=10 April 2008|accessdate=11 April 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080411015829/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/entertainment-news/2008/04/10/jade-goody-and-pete-doherty-top-worst-dinner-party-guest-list-86908-20378005/ |archivedate = 11 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion of Goody had softened by the time of her death.&lt;ref name="toi"/&gt; [[Sky Living]] broadcast five tribute shows from 2009 to 2012, documenting her life from early childhood through her rise to fame and her final months. The last episode of ''Big Brother'' on [[Channel 4]] featured a 15-minute tribute to Goody, praising her as the ultimate ''Big Brother'' contestant. She was one of several people to appear on the front cover of the final edition of ''[[News of the World]]'' on 10 July 2011.

==Early life==
Goody was born in [[Bermondsey]], [[London]], to [[Jackiey Budden]] and Andrew Goody. Her father was a [[substance dependence|drug addict]] and habitual criminal who spent time in prison, including a four-year term for robbery.&lt;ref name="entertainment1"/&gt; He and Budden separated when Goody was two; estranged from his daughter while Budden raised her, he died of a drug overdose in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/celebrity-news/271497/jade-goody-visits-dad-s-grave-for-first-time/1/ |title=Jade Goody visits dad's grave for first time |publisher=Now Magazine |date=27 August 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 5, Goody made an uncredited appearance as a primary school student in the 1986 television film ''[[List of London's Burning episodes#The TV Movie (1986)|London's Burning]]'' (filmed in her home town), which spawned [[London's Burning (TV series)|the television series of the same name]]. Before entering the ''Big Brother'' house, Goody, a [[Registered Dental Nurse|dental nurse]], lived in [[Upshire]], Waltham Abbey, [[Essex]].&lt;ref name="entertainment1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp |title=Births and Deaths England and Wales 1984–2006 |publisher=Findmypast.com |date= |accessdate=31 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831050858/http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp |archivedate=31 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===2002–2003: ''Big Brother 3''===
When Goody appeared on ''[[Big Brother 2002 (UK)|Big Brother 3]]'', she was ridiculed by the British [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] press for her lack of general knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Jade Goody Phenomenon |work=The Independent |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article2137700.ece |accessdate=3 October 2007 |location=London |date=9 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930211538/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article2137700.ece |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She thought the English city of [[Cambridge]] was in London;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Polly |last=Hudson |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/08/23/life-knocks-jade-goody-and-kerry-katona-down-but-they-always-bounce-back-115875-20707964/ |title=Life knocks Jade Goody and Kerry Katona down but they always bounce back |work=Mirror.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; when told that it was in [[East Anglia]], she assumed East Anglia was outside Britain and referred to it as "East Angula".&lt;ref name="Jade's wit and wisdom"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2055968.stm |title=Jade's wit and wisdom |work=BBC News |date=26 July 2002 |accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goody thought that [[Rio de Janeiro]] was a person, not a city; that Portugal was part of Spain; that [[St George's Cross]] was the flag of London, not [[flag of England|England]]; that [[Aberdeen]] was not in Scotland, and that the United States was not an [[English-speaking country]].&lt;ref name="Jade's wit and wisdom"/&gt; She was also criticised by the tabloid press during her time in the ''Big Brother'' house for [[backstabbing]] and an evening when she cavorted drunk and naked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbrotheronline.co.uk/celebritybigbrother5/contestants/Jade_Goody.htm |title=Jade Goody Big Brother Contestant Profile – Celebrity Big Brother 5 UK |publisher=Bigbrotheronline.co.uk |accessdate=22 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221211159/http://www.bigbrotheronline.co.uk/celebritybigbrother5/contestants/Jade_Goody.htm |archivedate=21 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003–2006: Initial fame and Sky Living series===
Goody appeared in her own reality TV shows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/tv/news/Article.aspx?cp-documentid=13034874 |title=Jade Goody shows all on TV show |website=-MSN UK |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=22 February 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, regularly, in celebrity, [[trivia]] and gossip-oriented women's magazines such as ''[[Heat (magazine)|Heat]]'' and ''[[OK!]]''. She participated in the 2006 [[London Marathon]] but did not finish (collapsing after {{convert|34|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the {{convert|42.195|km|mi|adj=on}} course), and recovered overnight at the [[Royal London Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://showbiz.sky.com/Jades-Marathon-Hell |title=Jade's Marathon Hell |website=Sky Showbiz |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=22 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330115005/http://showbiz.sky.com/Jades-Marathon-Hell |archivedate=30 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the marathon, Goody described her preparations to [[celebrity chef|TV chef]] [[Gordon Ramsay]]:  "I've been eating [[curry]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] and [[alcoholic beverage|drinking]]." She said afterwards, "I don't really understand miles. I didn't actually know how far it was going to be&amp;nbsp;... I didn't want to let everyone down." Goody raised [[pound sterling|£]]565.20 for her chosen charity, the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children |url=http://www.justgiving.com/jadegoody |title=NSPCC |publisher=Justgiving.com |date=23 April 2006 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 February 2004, Goody entered the ''[[Back to Reality (TV series)|Back to Reality]]'' house on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]. The series, similar to ''Big Brother'', featured contestants from other reality shows such as ''Big Brother'' and ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]''. She was evicted on Day 20.

In 2005 Goody created and introduced her own fragrance (Shh...) with distributor Jigsaw ESL, who gave its exclusive rights to [[Superdrug]].

On 5 January 2007 Goody, her boyfriend Jack Tweed and her mother entered the house for ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 5]]''.&lt;ref name=imnotracist/&gt;
She had just placed 25th in a ''Heat'' poll of the world's most influential people, with lifetime earnings of £8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="commentisfree2007"/&gt; Goody was told that she and her family (later joined by [[Jermaine Jackson]], [[Shilpa Shetty]] and [[Ken Russell]]) would live luxuriously in the main house, with the eight remaining celebrities living in the house next door as their servants. She was not told that she and her new family faced an eviction in which the public chose whom to keep. Goody's mother was the first to be evicted, on 10 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6249601.stm |work=BBC News |title=Jackiey first Big Brother evictee | date=11 January 2007 | accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of complaints were received by British broadcasting regulator [[Ofcom]] about the behaviour of [[Jo O'Meara]], [[Danielle Lloyd]] and Goody towards housemate Shilpa Shetty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6265127.stm |work=BBC News |title=Ofcom probes Big Brother 'racism' | date=16 January 2007 | accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6268401.stm |work=BBC News |title=Big Brother row reaches Commons | date=16 January 2007 | accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 20 January Ofcom received more than 44,500 complaints from the public (a record at the time),&lt;ref name=imnotracist&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6281223.stm |work=BBC News |title=I'm not racist, says TV's Goody | date=20 January 2007 | accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Big Brother sponsor suspends deal |work=BBC News |date=18 January 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6274881.stm |accessdate=24 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Channel 4 received an additional 3,000 complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Guardian |title=Racism, ratings and reality TV: now Big Brother creates a diplomatic incident |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,,1992924,00.html |accessdate=18 January 2007 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120145029/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0%2C%2C1992924%2C00.html |archivedate=20 January 2007 |first1=Owen |last1=Gibson |first2=Vikram |last2=Dodd |first3=Randeep |last3=Ramesh |date=18 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Goody's remarks were, "I've seen how she goes in and out of people's arseholes" and Shetty "makes [her] skin crawl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://showbiz.sky.com/showbiz/article/0,,50001-1247791,00.html |work=Sky Showbiz |title=Has Jade Lost It? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013111613/http://showbiz.sky.com/showbiz/article/0%2C%2C50001-1247791%2C00.html |archivedate=13 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibnlive.com/videos/31466/slurs-against-shilpa-continue-on-show.html CNN – IBN News] – ''slurs against shilpa continue on show &lt;nowiki&gt;'racism'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt; She also called Shetty "Shilpa Fuckawalla" and "[[Papadum|Shilpa Poppadom]]".

The incident triggered an international outcry, receiving extensive coverage in the Indian media (where [[Gordon Brown]], then British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], was visiting at the time). Brown condemned the programme for damaging the impression of Britain as a country of tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1992450,00.html |title=Big Brother row goes global |work=The Guardian |date=17 January 2007 | location=London | first=Chris | last=Tryhorn | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 17 January statement, Channel 4 defended the programme against charges "of overt racism or racial abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6272585.stm |work=BBC News |title=Channel 4 denies Brother 'racism' | date=18 January 2007 | accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goody was evicted from the ''Big Brother'' house on 19 January 2007, receiving 82 percent of the vote when she was up against Shetty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6283447.stm |title=Jade 'faces fight to save career' |work=BBC News |date=20 January 2007 |accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Channel 4]] prevented crowds from gathering outside the house, and cancelled her scheduled press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndtv.com/template/template.asp?template=racismrow&amp;slug=Shilpa+stays+on+in+%3Ci%3EBig+Brother%3C%2Fi%3E&amp;id=21207&amp;callid=0&amp;category=National |title=Shilpa Shetty stays on in Big Brother}}{{Dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Davina McCall]] shortly afterwards, Goody said she was "disgusted with [her]self" after seeing a video of the alleged bullying.&lt;ref&gt;Celebrity Big Brother Live, 19 January 2007 on Channel 4&lt;/ref&gt; Her much-publicised return to the Big Brother house was called "a terrible decision" by publicist [[Max Clifford]]: "It looks like she has ruined a very lucrative career".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/entertainment/6276279.stm |title=Profile: Jade Goody |work=BBC News |date=19 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302144253/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/entertainment/6276279.stm |archivedate=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Goody was a supporter of the anti-bullying charity [[Act Against Bullying]], which dropped her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6260000/newsid_6267600/6267675.stm |title=Bullying charity drops Jade Goody |publisher=BBC |work=CBBC Newsround |date=16 January 2007 |accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'', Goody said that her abuse of Shetty ruined her girl-next-door image.

Although Shetty did not lodge an official complaint about racist behaviour with ''Big Brother'', her allegations compelled police to investigate the possible classification of her treatment as "[[inciting ethnic hatred|racial hatred]]" under Part III of the [[Public Order Act 1986]]. In a statement, the [[Hertfordshire Constabulary|Hertfordshire police]] said that it was
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;... investigating allegations of racist behaviour in the ''Big Brother'' house and will be conducting enquiries, including a review of the tapes. We will continue to liaise with Ofcom and with Endemol, whom we have strongly encouraged to ensure that any form of behaviour that could raise similar concerns, does not occur. We will continue to closely monitor the situation over the next few days. Hertfordshire Constabulary will not tolerate racism in any form and is taking these allegations seriously. The constabulary has experience of investigating and resolving incidents in the ''Big Brother'' house in past seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dodd|first=Vikram|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1993588,00.html|title=Shilpa abuse a "racial incident"|date=18 January 2007|publisher=Media Guardian|accessdate=14 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a Channel 4 spokeswoman, ''Big Brother'' intervened so the contestants would "realise that what they have said has been misconstrued in the house". The idea, she said, was to allow the housemates "to explain themselves" to their fellow contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6279363.stm |title=Are housemates aware of race row? |date=19 January 2007 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 January 2007 |first=Mark |last=Savage}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a series of apologies to Shetty from the housemates, and her belief that Goody was not a racist: "I don't feel there was any racial discrimination happening from Jade's end&amp;nbsp;... I think that there are a lot of insecurities from her end but it's definitely not racial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6274881.stm |title=Big Brother sponsor suspends deal |date= 18 January 2007 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shetty was unaware of all the alleged insults (often made behind her back). Channel 4 was rebuked by Ofcom, which received more than 54,000 complaints, for its handling of the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/25/ofcom.broadcasting C4 to air Big Brother racism apologies | Media | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goody initially denied that her comments were racist: "She is Indian, thinking of an Indian name and only thing I could think of was Indian food. Wasn't racial at all. It was not to offend any Indian out there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/filmandtv/s/233/233670_celeb_bb_jade_calls_housemate_shilpa_poppadom.html |title=Celeb BB: Jade calls housemate 'Shilpa Fuckawhalia, Shilpa Poppadom' |work=Manchester Evening News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120171306/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/filmandtv/s/233/233670_celeb_bb_jade_calls_housemate_shilpa_poppadom.html |archivedate=20 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a later trip to India she apologised for her behaviour, admitting that her remarks to Shetty could be seen as racist. In a video on the [[BBC News]] website, Goody said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I know that things that I don't think are necessarily racist&amp;nbsp;... could be&amp;nbsp;... And I am sincerely sorry for the pain and hurt I've caused to Shilpa's family. I am wrong&amp;nbsp;... I am wrong and I know that my words and my actions were wrong and I'm not trying to justify that in any way – I am wrong, and the people who have complained are not wrong. They're just insulted by me and I completely take that criticism.&lt;ref name="Jade apology"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6400689.stm |title=Jade Goody says sorry to Indians |date=27 February 2007|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two days into the show she was diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]] and immediately withdrew, flying home to England. Scenes of Goody learning her diagnosis were not broadcast in India.

'''''Living With Jade Goody'''''
A reality-television documentary, ''Living With Jade Goody'', was shown in September 2008 as part of the  ''Living With...'' series on [[Living TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingtv.co.uk/shows/living-with-jade-goody.php |title=Jade Goody – Shows – Virgin Media |publisher=Livingtv.co.uk |accessdate=22 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303204918/http://www.livingtv.co.uk/shows/living-with-jade-goody.php |archivedate=3 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness==
Goody had a number of health scares during the 2000s. In 2002 (shortly before her ''Big Brother 3'' appearance) a [[Pap test|cervical smear test]] revealed [[Cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 1|abnormal cells]], a possible indicator of cancer. She was tested for ovarian cancer in 2004 and bowel cancer in 2006, with negative results for each. Goody had hospital tests in early August 2008, after her fourth cancer scare; she had collapsed four times.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} On 19 August, while she was on the Indian reality show ''[[Bigg Boss (Indian TV series)|Bigg Boss]]'', Goody was told that test results confirmed [[cervical cancer]]. According to her spokesperson, "It looks like her cancer is at an early stage but we will have to wait until she gets back to Britain and sees a specialist and has more tests."{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On 1 September 2008, it was reported that Goody's cancer was "advanced and life-threatening" and she would have surgery followed by [[chemotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Jade-Goody-Has-Advanced-And-Life-Threatening-Cervical-Cancer-Court-Hears/Article/200809115090929?lpos=Showbiz%2BNews_2&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15090929_Jade%2BGoody%2BHas%2B%2527Advanced%2BAnd%2BLife-Threatening%2527%2BCervical%2BCancer%252C%2BCourt%2BHears |title=Jade's Cancer 'Life-Threatening' |work=[[Sky News]] |date=1 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329021549/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Jade-Goody-Has-Advanced-And-Life-Threatening-Cervical-Cancer-Court-Hears/Article/200809115090929?lpos=Showbiz%2BNews_2&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15090929_Jade%2BGoody%2BHas%2B%27Advanced%2BAnd%2BLife-Threatening%27%2BCervical%2BCancer%2C%2BCourt%2BHears |archivedate=29 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors gave her a 65-percent chance of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Health/Jade-Goody-Cancer-Health-celebrity-reality-star/Article/200809115092982 |title=Jade Faces Further Cancer Tests |work=[[Sky News]] |date=4 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329014220/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Health/Jade-Goody-Cancer-Health-celebrity-reality-star/Article/200809115092982 |archivedate=29 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further tests and a [[radical hysterectomy]] "went well", according to her publicist, and Goody began chemotherapy and [[radiotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2008/0912/goodyj.html |title=RTÉ.ie Entertainment: Jade Goody has eight-hour operation |publisher=Rte.ie |date=12 September 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7613861.stm |title=Surgery on Jade Goody 'went well' |work=BBC News |date=13 September 2008 |accessdate=13 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], Goody said she had begun planning her funeral,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2008/1008/goodyj.html|title=Jade Goody talks about planning funeral|publisher=RTÉ|date=8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was losing her hair and had decided not to explain her illness to her children, aged 4 and 5 at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2008/1128/goodyj.html|title=Goody says she's losing her hair|publisher=RTÉ|date=8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 February 2009, Goody's publicist, [[Max Clifford]], confirmed that her cancer had spread to her [[liver]], [[bowel]] and [[groin]]. A previous 40-percent chance of survival was withdrawn, and she began treatment to prolong her life. On 7 February, Clifford reported that Goody had emergency surgery in London to remove a tumour on her bowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7876593.stm |title=Goody undergoes emergency surgery |work=BBC News | date=7 February 2009 |accessdate=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February, Clifford confirmed media reports that doctors at the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]] in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7890002.stm |title=Jade Goody 'has months to live' |work=BBC News |date=14 February 2009 |accessdate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; had classified her cancer as terminal; she could die within weeks, and at best was unlikely to survive more than a few months:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/4617493/Jade-Goody-Cancer-hit-celebrity-has-just-months-to-live.html |title=Jade Goody: Cancer-hit celebrity has just months to live |work=The Telegraph |date=14 February 2009 |accessdate=22 February 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; "She was informed yesterday that tragically, she's terminally ill.

On 5 March in the Royal Marsden Hospital, Goody asked to be [[baptism|baptised]];&lt;ref name="Enough"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23658031-details/%27Short+time+before+Jade%27s+suffering+ends%27/article.do |title=Short time before Jade's suffering ends |work=This is London |date=5 March 2009 |accessdate=5 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306214023/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23658031-details/%27Short%2Btime%2Bbefore%2BJade%27s%2Bsuffering%2Bends%27/article.do |archivedate= 6 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; two days later, she and her sons were christened.&lt;ref name="christening"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7930207.stm |title='Emotional' christening for Goody |work=BBC News|date=7 March 2009 |accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford confirmed that this was her last public appearance, and she had already said her goodbyes to her family: "We're hoping and praying that Jade pulls through, but the fact of the matter is that she now only has a short time to live."&lt;ref name="Enough" /&gt; He confirmed that during the next 24 hours her doctors could assess how long Goody had to live, but she had a very short time left in any case. Jack Tweed was allowed to extend his curfew, spending a last night with his wife before she said goodbye to the rest of her family.&lt;ref name="Enough" /&gt;

When the news spread that Goody's cancer was terminal, medical authorities in the UK began reporting a surge in requests from women (particularly younger women) for cervical-cancer screening. This reversed a trend which had seen demand for screening decline over the past decade, with the greatest decline among women aged 25–29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/17/cancer-tests-jade-goody|title=Cancer tests go up after Jade Goody diagnosis|work=The Guardian| date=17 February 2009 |accessdate=22 February 2009 | location=London | first=James | last=Sturcke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the publicity surrounding Goody's illness, on 13 March 2009 government health ministers agreed to review the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] policy not to screen for cervical cancer until age 25 in England (age 20 in the rest of the UK). That day, she issued a press release that she was "immensely proud" to have prompted the review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jeremy Laurance |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/goody-effect-forces-ministers-to-review-cancer-screening-policy-1644903.html |title=Goody effect forces ministers to review cancer screening policy|work=The Independent |date=14 March 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sky Living aired five tributes to Goody, documenting her early life, fame and final months, from 2009 to 2012. The final episode of ''Big Brother'' on [[Channel 4]] featured a 15-minute tribute, praising her as the ultimate ''Big Brother'' contestant.

In April 2009 [[Digital Spy]] called Goody the "ultimate reality TV star",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/realitytv/a151987/x-factor-big-brother-scoop-ds-reality-awards.html |title='X Factor', 'Big Brother' scoop DS Reality Awards |work=Digital Spy |date=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans were announced for ''Jade the Musical''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/21/20090423/tuk-actress-sought-for-jade-the-musical-6323e80.html Yahoo news] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426181648/http://uk.news.yahoo.com/21/20090423/tuk-actress-sought-for-jade-the-musical-6323e80.html |date=26 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That month [[Michael Parkinson]] wrote that Goody had become media property "to be manipulated and exploited till the day she died", representing "all that is paltry and wretched about Britain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6048656.ece |work=The Telegraph |title=Sir Michael Parkinson: 'Jade Goody was a wretched role model' | location=London | first=Nick | last=Cullen | date=7 April 2009 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7987426.stm |title=Parkinson: 'Goody was exploited' |work=BBC News | date=8 April 2009 | accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 December 2009 ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that according to a tribute site, Goody was the most-mourned celebrity of 2009 and received more tributes than [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/jade-goody-is-most-mourned-celebrity-1852665.html/ |title=Jade Goody is 'most mourned celebrity' |work=[[The Independent]] |author=Ellen Branagh |date=29 December 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2010 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101151653/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/jade-goody-is-most-mourned-celebrity-1852665.html |archivedate=1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere of ''[[Big Brother 2009 (UK)|Big Brother 10]]'' was dedicated to her memory, and a tribute was shown on the last episode of ''[[Ultimate Big Brother]]''.

==={{anchor|Cervical cancer awareness}}Cervical-cancer awareness===
The day of Goody's funeral, a spokeswoman for [[Cancer Research UK]] said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv.com/news/jade-story-raising-cancer-awareness-13694/ |title=Jade story raising cancer awareness |work=Berrow's Worcester Journal |date=22 July 2016 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Jade's story has raised awareness of cervical cancer which has led to hundreds of thousands of people contacting Cancer Research UK for information on the disease as the number of hits to our website, CancerHelp.org shows.

In October 2009 it was reported that the number of women between 25 and 64 having Pap tests in the United Kingdom had grown by 12 percent during the previous year, an increase (after year-to-year declines since 2002) credited to Goody's public battle with cervical cancer. Sky News health correspondent Thomas Moore said:&lt;ref name="news.sky.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Jade-Goody-Credited-With-Large-Increase-In-Cervical-Cancer-Screening-In-Last-Year/Article/200910415411610?lpos=UK_News_Carousel_Region_3&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15411610_Jade_Goody_Credited_With_Large_Increase_In_Cervical_Cancer_Screening_In_Last_Year |title=Jade Goody Credited With Cancer Test Rise |publisher=News.sky.com |date= |accessdate=31 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025043855/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Jade-Goody-Credited-With-Large-Increase-In-Cervical-Cancer-Screening-In-Last-Year/Article/200910415411610?lpos=UK_News_Carousel_Region_3&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15411610_Jade_Goody_Credited_With_Large_Increase_In_Cervical_Cancer_Screening_In_Last_Year |archivedate=25 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This is a tremendous flip for the NHS screening programme. Jade Goody had a particular impact on the women the NHS struggles to reach – the young and the less well educated. The challenge for public health doctors now is to ensure that this rise is sustained, so that Jade has a long-lasting legacy.}}

According to Health Secretary [[Andy Burnham]], "Jade's bravery and openness in her fight against cervical cancer has brought home to young women across the country the importance of regularly going for these checks."&lt;ref name="news.sky.com"/&gt; Gordon Brown said, "Her family can be extremely proud of the work she has done to raise awareness of cervical cancer which will benefit thousands of women across the UK."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7957852.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; PM leads tributes to Jade Goody |publisher=BBC News |date=22 March 2009 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Kandy Esala Perahera''' (the [[Esala Mangallaya|Esala]] procession of Kandy) also known as '''The Festival of the Tooth''' is a grand [[festival]] celebrated with elegant costumes and is held in July and August in [[Kandy]], [[Sri Lanka]]. This historical procession is held annually to pay homage to the [[Sacred Tooth Relic]] of [[Lord Buddha]], which is housed at the [[Sri Dalada Maligawa]] in Kandy. A unique symbol of Sri Lanka, the procession consists of many traditional local dances such as fire-dances, whip-dances, Kandyan dances and various other cultural dances, in addition to the elephants who are usually adorned with lavish garments. The festival ends with the traditional ''diya-kepeema'' ritual, a water cutting ceremony which is held at the [[Mahaweli River]] at [[Getambe]], Kandy.

==History==
[[File:Esala Perehera festival in 1885.jpg|Esala Perehera festival, around 1885|thumb|right|350px]]
The Esala is believed to be a fusion of two separate but interconnected "''Peraheras''" (Processions) – The ''Esala'' and ''Dalada''. The Esala Perahera, which is thought to date back to the 3rd century BC, was a ritual enacted to request the gods for rainfall. The Dalada Perahera is believed to have begun when the [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|Sacred Tooth Relic]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was brought to Sri Lanka from India during the 4th century CE, eight hundred years after the passing away of Lord Buddha.

According to tradition, the Tooth Relic was taken in procession to Sri Lanka by Princess Hemamala &amp; Prince Dantha.

===Modern Perahera===

After the Kandyan Kingdom fell to the British in 1815, the custody of the Relic was handed over to the ''Maha Sanga'' (the [[Buddhism|Buddhist Clergy]]). In the absence of the king, a  chief lay custodian called the "''[[Diyawadana Nilame]]''" was appointed to handle routine administrative matters concerning the relic and its care.

==The Procession==

The Kandy Esala Perahera begins with the ''Kap Situveema'' or ''Kappa'', in which a sanctified young [[Jackfruit|Jackfruit tree]] (Artocarpus integrifolia) is cut and planted in the premises of each of the four [[Devale (architecture)|Devale]]s dedicated to the four guardian gods [[Natha (disambiguation)|Natha]], [[Vishnu]], [[Katharagama]] and the goddess [[Pattini]]. Traditionally it was meant to shower blessing on the King and the people.

[[Image:Kandy dancers.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Dancers at the Esala Perahera]]

===The Kumbal Perahera===

For the next five nights, the "''Devale Peraheras''" take place within the premises of the four Devales with the priest of each Devale taking the pole every evening, accompanied by music and drumming, flag and canopy bearers, spearman and the ''Ran Ayudha'', the sacred insignia of the Gods.

On the sixth night, the ''Kumbal Perahera'' begins and continues on for five days. Initially, the Devale Peraheras assemble in front of the [[Temple of the Tooth]], which is [[Sri Lanka]]'s most important Buddhist Shrine and where the Buddha’s [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|Sacred Tooth Relic]] has been kept since the 16th Century) with their insignias placed on the ''ransivige'' (a dome-like structure) accompanied by the Basnayake Nilames (the lay custodians of the Devales).

The relic casket, which is a replica for the Tooth Relic, is placed inside the ransivige affixed to the Maligawa Elephant,   the ''Maligawa Perahera'' joins the awaiting Devale Peraheras and leads the procession. Whip-crackers and fireball acrobats clear the path, followed by the Buddhist flag bearers. Then, riding on the first elephant, is the official called ''Peramuna Rala'' (Front Official). He is followed by Kandyan Drummers and Dancers who enthrall the crowd, and are themselves followed by [[elephant]]s and other groups of musicians, dancers and flag bearers. A group of singers dressed in white heralds the arrival of the Maligawa Tusker carrying the [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|Sacred Tooth Relic]]. The [[Diyawadana Nilame]] (traditionally required to do everything in his power to ensure rain in the correct season) walks in traditional Kandyan-clothed splendor after the tusker.

The second procession is from the Natha Devale, which faces the Sri Dalada Maligawa and is said to be the oldest building in [[Kandy]], dating back to the 14th Century.

The third is from the Vishnu Devale ([[Vishnu]] being a Hindu god), also known as the Maha Devale. It is situated in front of the main gate of the Natha Devale.

[[File:Esala Perahera (Procession) 2006, Kandy, Sri Lanka.jpg|The procession of Katharagama Devale|350px|thumb|right]]

The fourth procession is from the Katharagama Devale (dedicated to the God of [[Kataragama deviyo]], identified with the warrior god [[Murugan|Skanda]]) which is on Kottugodalle Vidiya (a street in [[Kandy]]). This procession includes [[Kavadi]], the peacock dance, in which the pilgrim-dances carry semicircular wooden contraptions studded with peacock feathers on their shoulders.

The fifth and final procession is from the Pattini Devale ([[Pattini]] being a goddess associated with the cure of infectious diseases and called upon in times of drought and famine), which is situated to the West of the Natha Devale. This is the only procession that has [[women]] dances.

The following important times are announced by the firing of cannonballs, which can be heard all across [[Kandy]].

#The placing of the casket on the tuskers back
#The commencement of the Dalada Perahera
#The completion of the Perahera

===The Randoli Perahera===

The ''Randoli Perahera'' begins after five nights of the Kumbal Perahera. Randoli refers to palanquins on which the Queens of the ruling Kings traditionally traveled. 
2018 Kandy Esala Maha Perahera (Randoli Perahera) was held on 25 August 2018, the full moon poya day with the participation of hundreds thousands people.

===Diya Kepeema and the Day Perahera===

After a further five nights of the Randoli Perahera, the pageant ends with the ''Diya Kepeema'', which is the water cutting ceremony at the [[Mahaweli River]] at [[Getambe]], a town a few miles from Kandy. A Day Perahera is held to mark the ceremony.

==Organization of the Perahera==
[[Image:The good luck elephant.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Elephants at the Esala Perahera]]
The rituals connected with the Tooth Relic are conducted by Monks of the Malwatte Chapter and Asgiriya Chapters of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist clergy]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. It is the duty of the [[Diyawadana Nilame]] to organize the Perahera and thus he summons the large number of officials of the [[Temple of the Tooth]] and entrusts them with various ceremonial duties connected with the conducting of the Perahera. He first gets the auspicious time from the ''Nekath Mohottala'', the advisor on [[astrology|astrological]] matters. The task of organising the different types of drummers is handed over to the four officials known as the ''Panikka Mura Baarakaruwo''.

The Maligawa officials also meet the owners of the [[elephant]]s due to take part in the Perahera (most elephants are privately owned). The dance troupes are given time to prepare. The Basnayake Nilames (the lay custodians of the Devales) are then told to organise their processions.

==Perahera Sandeshaya==
[[File:Diyawadana Nilame H.B Udurawana &amp; Most Venerable Sirimalwatte Ananda Mahanayake Thero.jpg|thumb|right|200px|President William Gopallawa receiving the sannasa.]]
On completion of the Perahera, the Diyawadana Nilame would lead a procession consisting of the Nilames of Sathara Maha Devalas and the Nilames of rural devalas to the [[President's Pavilion]] carrying a sannasa (formal letter) known as the Perahera Sandeshaya to the [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] stating the successful complition of the annual Esala Perahera. The President would meet and receive the sannasa at the entrance to the President's Pavilion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5886">'''Loser.com''' is a [[domain name]] which existed as a [[URL redirect]] to several different webpages during most of its existence. {{As of|April 2018}}, it is a news website that publishes articles opposing [[Donald Trump]].

==History==
The Loser.com domain name was registered in 1995 by Brian Connelly.&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"/&gt;

It redirected to the website of the [[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000|2000 presidential campaign of Al Gore]] in 2000; a website opposing former [[Governor of South Carolina]] [[Jim Hodges]] in much of 2002; the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama]] in 2008;{{efn-ua|“That wasn’t against Obama’s election!” Connelly said. “That was just getting people to register."&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/2016/02/02/loser-com-donald-trump/ |title=Loser.com Redirects to Wikipedia Page for Donald Trump: Online nose-thumbing takes place after Trump's second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. |last=Mikkelson |first=David |authorlink=David Mikkelson |date=May 4, 2016 |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |access-date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[WikiLeaks]] in 2010; an article about American politician [[Sean Duffy]] in 2011; and the [[Reddit]] website in 2012.&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/04/meet-kanye-west-s-no-1-online-troll-loser-com-owner-brian-connelly-on-shaming-kanye.html |title=Meet Kanye West’s No. 1 Online Troll: Loser.com Owner Brian Connelly on Shaming Kanye |last=Stern |first=Marlow |date=5 March 2015 |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/03/03/a-short-history-of-loser-com-the-internets-best-troll/ |title=A short history of Loser.com, the Internet’s best troll |last=Dewey |first=Caitlin |date=3 March 2015 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Connelly, the website sometimes redirects to topics he considers positive to increase their traffic.&lt;ref name="DailyBeast" /&gt;

The domain name gained mainstream coverage in March 2015, when it redirected to the [[English Wikipedia]] entry for American rapper [[Kanye West]]; Marlow Stern of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' suggested that the redirect was done in response to West's reactions to American singer [[Beck]]'s album ''[[Morning Phase]]'' winning [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/01/the-internet-is-trolling-kanye-west-loser-com-redirects-to-kanye-s-wikipedia-page.html |title=The Internet Is Trolling Kanye West: Loser.com Redirects to Kanye’s Wikipedia Page |last=Stern |first=Marlow |date=1 March 2015 |work=[[The Daily Beast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan Gajewski of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and Christopher Hooton of ''[[The Independent]]'' both suggested that the domain name was a Beck reference because "[[Loser (Beck song)|Loser]]" is one of Beck's most notable songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/losercom-redirects-kanye-wests-wikipedia-778827 |title=Loser.com Redirects to Kanye West's Wikipedia Page |last=Gajewski |first=Ryan |date=2 March 2015 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/someone-made-losercom-redirect-to-kanye-wests-wikipedia-page-10079452.html |title=Someone made Loser.com redirect to Kanye West's Wikipedia page |last=Hooton |first=Christopher |date=2 March 2015 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Stern on 5 March, Connelly admitted that he had a negative impression of West, and intended the redirection as a [[Internet trolling|troll]] attempt on the rapper.&lt;ref name="DailyBeast" /&gt;

In February 2016, the website redirected to the English Wikipedia entry for then-[[United States presidential election, 2016|U.S. presidential candidate]] [[Donald Trump]] after he placed second in the [[United States presidential election in Iowa, 2016|Iowa caucus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/4204929/donald-trump-trolled-loser-wikipedia/ |title=Loser.com Now Redirects to Donald Trump's Wikipedia Page |last=White |first=Daniel |date=2 February 2016 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending the move, Connelly described Trump as "a man who attacks Muslims, who attacks Muslim Americans, who pushes fear and doubt" and "the definition of a loser".&lt;ref name="WaPo2016"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/02/02/man-behind-the-updated-loser-com-donald-trump-is-the-definition-of-a-loser/ |title=Man behind the updated Loser.com: Donald Trump ‘is the definition of a loser’ |last=Dewey |first=Caitlin |date=2 February 2016 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|April 2017}}, loser.com is a news website that publishes articles opposing now-US President Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loser.com/ |title=Loser - The Donald Trump News Site |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6pUhcX6PX?url=http://loser.com/ |archive-date=5 April 2017 |dead-url=no |access-date=5 April 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about his motives with his redirects, Connelly said the year 2000 redirect to losing Tennessee gubernatorial candidate Bill Daley's website was because “I think he was anti-gay”. He had "no comment" about the 2002 redirect to an opposition site targeting South Carolina Governor [[Jim Hodges]].&lt;ref name="snopes" /&gt;

[[File:Louvre Pyramid.jpg|thumb|The Louvre Pyramid|372x372px]]

The '''Louvre Pyramid''' (Pyramide du Louvre) is a large [[glass]] and metal [[pyramid]] designed by Chinese-American architect [[I.M. Pei]], surrounded by three smaller pyramids, in the main courtyard (Cour Napoléon) of the Louvre Palace ([[Palais du Louvre]]) in [[Paris]]. The large pyramid serves as the main entrance to the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre Museum]]. Completed in 1989,&lt;ref name="SimonsNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=5 Pieces of Europe's Past Return to Life: France; A vast new exhibition space as the Louvre renovates |work=The New York Times|date=28 March 1993|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDF1F39F93BA15750C0A965958260|accessdate=7 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become a landmark of the city of [[Paris]].

==Design and construction==
[[File:Louvre Palace.jpg|thumb|Inside the Pyramid: the view of the Louvre Museum in Paris from the underground lobby of the pyramid.]]

Commissioned by the President of [[France]], [[François Mitterrand]], in 1984, it was designed by the architect [[I. M. Pei]]. The structure, which was constructed entirely with [[glass]] segments and metal poles, 
reaches a height of {{convert|21.6|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Glassontheweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassonweb.com/articles/article/94 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020112004520/http://www.glassonweb.com/articles/article/94/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 January 2002 |title=Architecture: Louvre Pyramid |work=Glass on the Web |date=June 2005 |accessdate=16 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its square base has sides of {{convert|34|m|ft}} and a base surface area of {{convert|1000|m2|ft2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Official Press Release|first1=Louvre|title=“Pyramid” Project Launch: The Musée du Louvre is improving visitor reception (2014-2016)|url=http://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/dp_pyramide%2028102014_en.pdf|website=Louvre|accessdate=16 May 2016|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of 603 [[rhombus|rhombus-shaped]] and 70 triangular glass segments.&lt;ref name="Glassontheweb"/&gt;
The pyramid structure was engineered by Nicolet Chartrand Knoll Ltd. of [[Montreal]] (Pyramid Structure / Design Consultant) and [[RFR Engineers|Rice Francis Ritchie]] of [[Paris]] (Pyramid Structure / Construction Phase).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcfandp.com/a/p/8315/s.html |title= Grand Louvre: Phase I |publisher=Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners |date= |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pyramid and the underground lobby beneath it were created because of a series of problems with the Louvre's original main entrance, which could no longer handle the enormous number of visitors on an everyday basis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Visitors entering through the pyramid descend into the spacious lobby then ascend into the main Louvre buildings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

For design historian [[Mark Pimlott]], "I.M. Pei’s plan distributes people effectively from the central concourse to myriad destinations within its vast subterranean network... the architectonic framework evokes, at gigantic scale, an ancient atrium of a [[Pompeii]]an villa; the treatment of the opening above, with its tracery of engineered castings and cables, evokes the atria of corporate office buildings; the busy movement of people from all directions suggests the concourses of rail termini or international airports."&lt;ref name="Pimlott"&gt;{{cite book |last= Pimlott |first= Mark |year= 2007 |url= http://www.artdesigncafe.com/The-Grand-Louvre-I-M-Pei-Pimlott-2007 |chapter= The Grand Louvre &amp; I.M. Pei |type= Excerpt |title= Without and Within: Essays on Territory and the Interior |via= artdesigncafe |publisher= Episode Publishers |location= Rotterdam |access-date= 13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other museums have duplicated this concept, most notably the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Chicago]]. The [[Dolphin Centre]], featuring a similar pyramid, was opened in April 1982, by [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Phil |last= Steer |url= http://www.romford.org/sports/swimming/dolphin/dolphin01.htm |title= Dolphin Centre: Brief History |work= Romford Now &amp; Then |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111123140716/http://www.romford.org/sports/swimming/dolphin/dolphin01.htm |archivedate= 23 November 2011 |df= dmy-all }}{{Self-published source|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction work on the pyramid base and underground lobby was carried out by the [[Vinci (construction)|Vinci]] construction company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/en/history-sites.htm?OpenAgent&amp;the_grand_louvre_museum |title= History |publisher= Vinci |date=  |accessdate= 16 January 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111001122424/http://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/en/history-sites.htm?OpenAgent&amp;the_grand_louvre_museum |archivedate= 1 October 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1839, according to one newspaper account, in ceremonies commemorating the "glorious revolution" of 1830, "The tombs of the Louvre were covered with black hangings and adorned with tricolored flags. In front and in the middle was erected an expiatory monument of a pyramidical shape, and surmounted by a funeral vase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=The Paris Sketch Book Of Mr. M. A. Titmarsh|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The construction of the pyramid triggered many years of strong and lively aesthetic and political debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tempest|first1=Rone|title=Controversial New Pyramid Entrance to the Louvre Opens in Paris|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-30/entertainment/ca-1039_1_glass-pyramid|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticisms tended to fall into four areas:  (1) the modernist style of the edifice being inconsistent with the classic French Renaissance style and history of the Louvre;  (2) the pyramid being an unsuitable symbol of death from ancient Egypt;  (3) the project being an immodest, pretentious, megalomaniacal folly imposed by then-President [[François Mitterrand]]; and (4) Chinese-American architect [[I.M. Pei]] being insufficiently French to be entrusted with the task of updating the treasured Parisian landmark.&lt;ref name="IM PEI Pyramid"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bernstein|first1=Richard|title=I.M. Pei's Pyramid: A Provocative Plan for The Louvre|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/magazine/im-pei-s-pyramid-a-provative-plan-for-the-louvre.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those criticizing the aesthetics said it was "sacrilegious" to tamper with the Louvre's majestic old French Renaissance architecture, and called the pyramid an anachronistic intrusion of an Egyptian death symbol in the middle of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberger|first1=Paul|title=Pei Pyramid and New Louvre Open Today|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/29/arts/pei-pyramid-and-new-louvre-open-today.html?pagewanted=1|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, political critics referred to the structure as ''Pharaoh Francois' Pyramid''.&lt;ref name="IM PEI Pyramid"/&gt;
Many still continue to feel the harsh modernism of the edifice is out of place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stamberg|first1=Susan|title=Landmark At The Louvre: The Pyramid Turns 20|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121097261|website=NPR|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=16 May 2016}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carbone|first1=Ken|title=Viva Le Louvre!

Pei's Controversial Pyramid Defies Critics|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1271948/viva-le-louvre-20-im-peis-controversial-pyramid-defies-critics|website=Fast Company|publisher=Mansueto Ventures, LLC|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Souza|first1=Eduardo|title=AD Classics: Le Grande Louvre / I.M. Pei|url=http://www.archdaily.com/88705/ad-classics-le-grande-louvre-i-m-pei/|website=Arch Daily|publisher=Plataforma Networks Broadcasting Architecture Worldwide|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the design phase, there was a proposal{{by whom|date=May 2015}} that the design include a spire on the pyramid to simplify window washing. Pei objected, however, and this proposal was eliminated.

==Urban legend of 666 panes==
It has been claimed by some that the glass panes in the Louvre Pyramid number exactly 666, "the [[number of the beast]]", often associated with [[Satan]]. Dominique Stezepfandt's book ''François Mitterrand, Grand Architecte de l'Univers'' declares that "the pyramid is dedicated to a power described as the Beast in the [[Book of Revelation]] (...) The entire structure is based on the number 6."

The story of the 666 panes originated in the 1980s, when the official brochure published during construction did indeed cite this number (even twice, though a few pages earlier the total number of panes was given as 672 instead).  The number 666 was also mentioned in various newspapers. The Louvre museum, however, states that the finished pyramid contains 673 glass panes (603 rhombi and 70 triangles).&lt;ref name="Glassontheweb"/&gt;  A higher figure was obtained by David A. Shugarts, who reports that the pyramid contains 689 pieces of glass.&lt;ref name="secrets"&gt;''Secrets of the Code'', edited by Dan Burstein, p. 259.{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shugarts obtained the figure from the Pei's offices.

Elementary arithmetic allows for easy counting of the panes: each of the three sides of the pyramid without an entrance has 18 triangular panes and 17 rows of rhombic ones arranged in a [[triangular number|triangle]], thus giving &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{17\cdot(17+1)}{2}=153&lt;/math&gt; rhombic panes (171 panes total).  The side with the entrance has 11 panes fewer (9 rhombic, 2 triangular), so the whole pyramid consists of &lt;math&gt;4\cdot153-9=603&lt;/math&gt; rhombi and &lt;math&gt;4\cdot18-2=70&lt;/math&gt; triangles, 673 panes total.

The myth resurfaced in 2003, when [[Dan Brown]] incorporated it in his best-selling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', in which the protagonist reflects that "this pyramid, at President Mitterrand's explicit demand, had been constructed of exactly 666 panes of glass&amp;nbsp;— a bizarre request that had always been a hot topic among conspiracy buffs who claimed 666 was the number of [[Satan]]."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brown. ''The Da Vinci Code'', p. 21.{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, David A. Shugarts reports that according to a spokeswoman of the offices of Pei, the French President never specified the number of panes to be used in the pyramid. Noting how the 666 rumor circulated in some French newspapers in the mid-1980s, she commented: "If you only found those old articles and didn't do any deeper fact checking, and were extremely credulous, you might believe the 666 story."&lt;ref name="secrets"/&gt;

==''La Pyramide Inversée''==
{{Main|La Pyramide Inversée}}
''La Pyramide Inversée'' (''The Inverted Pyramid'') is a skylight in the [[Carrousel du Louvre]] shopping mall in front of the Louvre Museum. It looks like an upside-down and smaller version of the ''Louvre Pyramid''.

==Renovation==
Designed for a museum that attracted 4.5 million visitors a year, the pyramid proved inadequate by the time the Louvre's attendance had doubled in 2014. Between 2014 and 2017, the layout of the foyer area in the Cour Napoleon beneath the glass pyramid is undergoing a thorough redesign, including better access to the pyramid and the Passage Richelieu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Javier |last=Pes |date=28 April 2014 |url=http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Louvres-director-makes-unblocking-pyramid-bottleneck-a-priority/32552 |title=Louvre's Director Makes Unblocking Pyramid Bottleneck a Priority |work=[[The Art Newspaper]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429215635/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Louvres-director-makes-unblocking-pyramid-bottleneck-a-priority/32552 |archivedate=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maata Näkyvissä Festival''' (''Land Ahoy'') is the biggest [[Christian]] music event in the [[Nordic Countries]]. It takes place in [[Turku]], [[Finland]], the venue being [[HK Arena]] (previously known as Turkuhalli) and the [[Turku Fair Centre]]. The organizers of the event are the [[Lutheran Evangelical Association of Finland]] and the Evangelical Lutheran parishes of Turku. In 2010 the event was organized for the 26th time. The festival lasts from Friday to Sunday, and takes place in the latter half of November every year. There are about 1300 volunteers helping in the arrangements.

== History ==
On September 19, 1984, 17-year-old Timo Vainio died from a heart attack during his school day. A memorial event was held a year later, in November 1985 in Pallivaha church in Turku with theme ''Maata Näkyvissä'' (Land Ahoy). In the event there were about 120 young people who decided to organize the event again next year.

In 2009, the event attracted nationwide attention in Finland due to swine influenza (H1N1) epidemic which was feared to spread dramatically in the festival. The topic was raised in [[Kotimaa]] magazine by physician Jane Marttila who was in charge of communicable diseases.

'''Man-made structures visible from earth orbit''' without magnification (by mechanical aids such as a camera or binoculars) include highways, dams, and cities.&lt;ref name="Urban legends"&gt;[http://urbanlegends.about.com/b/2003/10/08/whats-visible-from-outer-space.htm Urban Legends.com website]. Accessed May 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Straight dope"&gt;[[Cecil Adams]], "Is the Great wall of China the only manmade object you can see from space?", ''The Straight Dope'', found at [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/417/is-the-great-wall-of-china-the-only-manmade-object-you-can-see-from-space The Straight Dope website].  Accessed May 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;Snopes, "Great wall from space", last updated 21 July 2007, found at [http://www.snopes.com/science/greatwall.asp Snopes.com archives]. Accessed May 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently made world's tallest statue [[Statue of Unity]] in [[India]] is not visible from space without magnification. Also the [[Great Wall of China]], is not visible from [[low Earth orbit]] without magnifying instrument and even then only under perfect conditions, but not from the Moon.&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"the wall is only visible from low orbit under a specific set of weather  and lighting conditions. And many other structures that are less spectacular from an earthly vantage point—desert roads, for example—appear more prominent from an orbital perspective." The [[Afsluitdijk]] in The Netherlands can also be seen from outer space''[[Scientific American]]'' found at [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=is-chinas-great-wall-visible-from-space Is China's Great Wall Visible from Space? at Scientific American website].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Part of the problem in authoritatively answering questions about visibility from space is that such questions are often very vaguely framed: askers frequently do not precisely define how far above [[sea level]] their hypothetical or actual observer in [[outer space|space]] is located. When just speaking of "space", an asker might mean anywhere from the [[edge of space]] ([[Kármán line]]) at an altitude of {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} to low Earth orbit of 160–2,000 km (99-1200 mi) to [[Apollo 12]]'s orbit at {{convert|290|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the [[Moon]], which orbits about {{convert|381,415|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt;  
The [[Kármán line]] is accepted by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|World Air Sports Federation]], an international standard setting and record-keeping body for [[aeronautics]] and [[astronautics]], as the boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and [[outer space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/press_releases/2004/documents/12-04_100&amp;nbsp;km_astronautics.doc|title=The 100 km Boundary for Astronautics|publisher=[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] Press Release|date=2004-06-24|format=DOC|accessdate=2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a practical definition for the purpose of answering questions on what astronauts generally can see from space would reflect altitudes that manned spacecraft typically orbit the [[Earth]] at—often several hundreds of kilometres.&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt; There are major differences in visibility from just above the Kármán line (100 km/62 miles) and the [[International Space Station|ISS]] orbit (394&amp;nbsp;km/245 miles), for example.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Examples==

From US [[Space Shuttle|Space Shuttles]], which typically orbited at around 135 miles (237 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside.&lt;ref name="Urban legends" /&gt; Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes.&lt;ref name="Straight dope" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://starryskies.com/articles/2003/10/earth.visible.html Starry Skies website]&lt;/ref&gt; At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.

Metropolitan areas are clear at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see [[light pollution]]).

==Misconceptions==

===The Great Wall of China===
The claim that the [[Great Wall of China#Visibility from space|Great Wall of China]] is the only man-made object visible from the moon or outer space has been debunked many times,&lt;ref name="Urban legends" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Straight dope" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt; but remains a [[List of common misconceptions|common misconception]] in popular culture.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;"Metro Tesco", ''[[The Times]]'' (Londund at [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article7107871.ece  The Times website].&lt;/ref&gt;  According to astronauts [[Eugene Cernan]] and [[Ed Lu]], the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of [[low Earth orbit]], but only under very favorable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Scientific American]]'', February 21, 2008. "[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-chinas-great-wall-visible-from-space/ Is China's Great Wall Visible from Space?]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Different claims are made for the [[factoid]] that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. [[William Stukeley]] mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754,&lt;ref&gt;''The Family Memoirs of the Rev. William Stukeley'' (1887) Vol. 3, p. 142. (1754) "Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the moon."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir Henry Norman, 1st Baronet|Henry Norman]] made the same claim in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Henry, '' The Peoples and Politics of the Far East'', p. 215. (1895) "Besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the moon."&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of "canals" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.great-wall-china.cn/great-wall-faq/great-wall-of-china-from-space.html How is Great Wall of China from Space?]"&lt;/ref&gt; A viewer would need visual acuity 17,000 times better than normal to see the Great Wall from the Moon.&lt;ref name=LopezGil&gt;{{cite journal | title=Is it Really Possible to See the Great Wall of China from Space with a Naked Eye? | author=Norberto López-Gil | journal=Journal of Optometry | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=3–4 | url=http://www.journalofoptometry.org/Archive/vol1/pdf/02%20Vol1-n1%20Letter%20to%20the%20Editor.pdf | doi=10.3921/joptom.2008.3 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007224439/http://www.journalofoptometry.org/Archive/vol1/pdf/02%20Vol1-n1%20Letter%20to%20the%20Editor.pdf | archivedate=2009-10-07 | df= | pmc=3972694 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture ==
[[Trivia]] questions&lt;ref name="Straight dope" /&gt; and [[urban legend]]s&lt;ref name="Urban legends" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt; often claim certain constructed objects or effects are so large they are visible from outer space. For example, a giant [[beaver dam]] in [[Canada]] was described as "so large it is visible from outer space."&lt;ref name="Beaver dam"&gt;Michel Comte and Jacques Lemieu, "World's biggest beaver dam discovered in northern Canada," [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]],  May 5, 2010, found at [https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100505/sc_afp/canadascienceenvironmentanimalbeaver Yahoo News].

'''Marmot Day''' is an [[Alaska]]n holiday established to celebrate [[marmot]]s and Alaskan culture. Although local festivals have been part and parcel of frontier life for decades, Marmot Day became an official holiday on April 18, 2009, when the [[26th Alaska State Legislature]] officially passed Senate Bill 58.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_documents.asp?session=26&amp;docid=1856 Alaska Senate Bill 58 (pdf)].

Retrieved 2012-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt; and all the cities in between, Marmot Day has become an Alaskan institution.

== Alaskan Senate Bill ==
Senate Bill 58, sponsored by Sen. [[Linda Menard]], R-[[Wasilla, Alaska|Wasilla]], was first introduced by the late Dr. Curtis Menard, Linda Menard's husband and former state legislator.  Concerned by the gradual decline of Alaska's folk values, and worried that the 49th state would become a suburb of [[Houston]] both culturally and economically{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, Dr. Menard drew a line in the sand with his idea of creating Marmot Day in the 1990s.  After getting stuck in a committee while politics was played, the controversial Marmot Day bill died in the legislature. Sen. Linda Menard reintroduced the bill for the 26th Alaska Legislature, and the bill passed by a Marmot's whisker on the second to last day of the legislative session, and [[Sarah Palin]] signed it into law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aksenate.org/index.php?legpress_id=587 "2nd Annual Marmot Day will take place February 2 across Alaska"] AKSenate.org.

== Distinguished from Marmot Day in Owosso, Michigan ==
Marmot Day is also the name of a community celebration in [[Owosso, Michigan]], occurring on July 25 (or on the following Monday if the 25th falls on a weekend).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marmotday.com MarmotDay.com]. Retrieved 2012-07-10.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a celebration of all marmots, which include groundhogs, woodchucks, and ground squirrels.

Marmot Day was first celebrated in 2002 as a day celebrating all marmots. A luncheon is traditional as part of the celebration, marmot jokes and ginger snaps are shared, among other festivities typical of party celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_documents.asp?session=26&amp;docid=1856 SB 58: Bill Packet].

'''Melodifestivalen 2010''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] song contest held between February and March 2010. It was the selection for the 50th song to represent [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest]], and was the 49th edition of [[Melodifestivalen]]. Five semi-finals were held in the Swedish cities of [[Örnsköldsvik]], [[Sandviken]], [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malmö]], with [[Örebro]] hosting the final ''Andra Chansen'' (Second Chance) round.

After the five semi-finals 10 songs had qualified to the final of the contest, contested in the Swedish capital of [[Stockholm]], at the [[Ericsson Globe|Globe Arena]]. After the voting of 11 juries and a public televote had been revealed, the final winner was [[Anna Bergendahl]] with the pop ballad "[[This Is My Life (Anna Bergendahl song)|This Is My Life]]", which received top marks from the public televote, and placing 2nd after the votes of the 11 juries.

The 2010 Melodifestivalen, as with recent editions of the festival, implemented a number of new rules which changed the dynamics of the contest, including the new "web wildcard" competition, held on the SVT website from October to November 2009, selecting the final semi-finalist from submitted entries on the SVT website.

==Rules==
{{See also|History of Melodifestivalen|Voting at Melodifestivalen}}
The current Melodifestivalen rules were first introduced in [[Melodifestivalen 2002|2002]] – five semi-finals are held every year: the first four semi-finals each with 8 songs, where the top two songs directly qualify to the final of the contest, while the third and fourth-placed songs qualify to the final semi-final, the ''Andra Chansen'' (Second Chance) round. Eight songs compete in the Second Chance round, competing in a knock-out format until two songs are left, which qualify to the final. These songs are chosen by a public televote held on the night of the contest. The final consisted of 10 songs, who are awarded marks by 11 regional juries of Sweden, alongside televoting, with each comprising 50% of the total result.

28 songs are selected from a public call for songs by SVT. These are chosen from a large number of entries, with over 3000 entries being received by SVT in past contests. These songs are reduced by the Swedish Music Publishers Association (''Svenska musikförläggareföreningen''; SMFF), who reduce this large number to around 1200 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=3969 |title=One month left for Melodifestivalen entries |last=Fisher |first=Luke |date=2008-08-25 |publisher=''Oikotimes'' |accessdate=2008-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301050602/http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=3969 |archivedate=2009-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sixteen-person jury reduce this number once again to the final 28 competing songs. These 28 songs are then joined by compositions by four songwriters invited by SVT, who each submit a song into the competition.

For the 2010 contest SVT decided to change parts of the format. The duels during the semi-finals introduced in 2008 were abolished. The single "international jury" used in 2009, which selected an 11th finalist and voted during the final as a 12th jury, was also abolished. This was replaced by a complete change in the jury voting during the final - instead of 11 regional juries there would be 6 international juries in Russia, Ireland, Norway, Greece, Serbia and France voting on the 10 finalists along with 5 Swedish juries in [[Luleå]], [[Umeå]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Malmö]] and [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="voting1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.121594/1.1847853/nyheter_i_melodifestivalen?lid=puff_1847892&amp;lpos=lasMer |title=Nyheter i Melodifestivalen |date=2010-01-15 |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=15 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124134042/http://svt.se/2.121594/1.1847853/nyheter_i_melodifestivalen?lid=puff_1847892&amp;lpos=lasMer |archivedate=24 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voting2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poplight.se/artikel/svt-avsloejar-roestningsnyheter-i-deltaevlingarna-och-finalen |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130418092105/http://poplight.se/artikel/svt-avsloejar-roestningsnyheter-i-deltaevlingarna-och-finalen |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-18 |title=SVT avslöjar röstningsnyheter i deltävlingarna och finalen |last=Bolander |first=Mattias |date=2010-01-15 |publisher=''Poplight'' |language=Swedish |accessdate=15 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Repo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15349|title=The international juries in Sweden revealed|last=Repo|first=Juha|date=2010-03-11|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual design===
[[File:StageMelodifestivalen2010.jpg|left|thumb|230px|The stage of the contest]]
The Melodifestivalen logo for the Contest, the five spotlights, has been in place since 2002, and remained in use for the 2010 Contest. The first details of the 2010 stage were released on 28 January. For the fourth time, the set was designed by [[Viktor Brattström]], with the intention to provide the feeling of a club environment: "This year we can present a scene that should evoke the idea of an exclusive club environment. Levels and stairs offers artists the opportunity for action and linking the stage into a place of celebration."&lt;ref name="visual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.121594/1.1865624/scenskissen_for_melodifestivalen_2010|title=Scenskissen för Melodifestivalen 2010|date=2009-01-08|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=8 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131071555/http://svt.se/2.121594/1.1865624/scenskissen_for_melodifestivalen_2010|archivedate=31 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage uses different height to allow the artists to use the stage most effectively to create their own number, and extensive use of [[LED]] screens to create different moods.&lt;ref name="visual" /&gt;

==Entries==
32 songs competed in Melodifestivalen 2010. 27 of them were selected from a public call for songs, in which public songwriters and artists could send in songs to SVT, until 22 September 2009. Five songs were selected to compete in the contest as wildcards: SVT internally selected four songwriting teams and artists to compete in the contest, to diversify the musical quality of the competition; a final song was selected through a "web wildcard" competition, with the Swedish public selecting one song by an unknown act to progress to the semi-finals.

===Wildcards===
As since 2004 SVT has specially invited four artists and composers to compete in Melodifestivalen, in order to diversify the musical qualify of the contest. As well as this the 2010 contest introduced a "web wildcard" competition, in which songwriters who were not linked to any record companies could publish compositions over two weeks in September and October 2009 on SVT Melodifestivalen website. The winner of the web wildcard was selected by the Swedish public through SMS voting, with the song that received the most votes by 12 November competing in the televised semi-finals.&lt;ref name="Wildcard" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14317|title=Melodifestivalen Web Wildcard announced|last=Yalcinkaya|first=Hakan|date=2009-09-14|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EBU wildcard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EBU wildcard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=4053&amp;_t=Sweden+goes+for+an+online+wildcard|title=Sweden goes for an online wildcard|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|date=2009-09-03|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Web wildcard====
The first web wildcard contest for Melodifestivalen was held from September to November 2009. This allowed new promising talents a new way to enter Melodifestivalen instead of through the regular public submission process, in which amateur musicians rarely succeeded. Musicians who didn't have or had never had any contract with a music publishing house or never had any of their work published could enter songs onto SVT's Melodifestivalen website from 21 September to 4 October. From 14 October to 12 November 2009, the qualifying songs were voted for by SMS voting in Sweden, with the winning song being decided on 12 November 2009&lt;ref name="Wildcard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EBU wildcard" /&gt;

246 songs were submitted for the web wildcard, with 180 selected to compete in the competition, after disqualifying those that did not meet the rules of the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14378|title=Sweden: 246 try to win a web wildcard|last=Repo|first=Juha|date=2009-10-07|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following weeks the bottom songs in the public SMS vote were eliminated from the contest, leaving 10 songs left:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14401|title=A flying start for the Melodifestivalen web wildcard voting|last=Repo|first=Juha|date=2009-10-17|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.121594/1.1788851/flygande_start_for_webbjokern|title=Flygande start för Webbjokern|date=2009-10-15|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=4 December 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202110751/http://svt.se/2.121594/1.1788851/flygande_start_for_webbjokern|archivedate=2 December 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 14 October 2009 – all 180 entries were made available for voting
* 21 October 2009 – 100 entries went on to the next round
* 28 October 2009 – 50 entries went on to the next round
* 4–12 November 2009– ten entries were left, one would be voted out every day
* 12 November 2009 – winner announced

On 4 November the top ten songs were announced by SVT. Each day, until 11 November 2009, one song was eliminated from the competition, with only three songs left. The winner was announced on 12 November at 8:45&amp;nbsp;am on SVT's morning news programme ''Gomorron Sverige'', with the duo [[MiSt]] (Mia Terngård &amp; Stefan Lebert) winning the contest with the song was "Come and Get Me Now".&lt;ref name="Web wildcard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SVT webbjoker" /&gt;

===Disqualified songs===
On 14 October 2009 SVT revealed the first 27 entries which the jury had selected, of a total of 2860 submissions to the contest. However on 15 October 2009, it was announced that "Never Heard of Him", composed by [[Figge Boström]] and [[Anna Engh]], was disqualified after it appeared briefly on Figge Boström's [[MySpace]] page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14396|title=Disqualification in Melodifestivalen|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2009-10-15|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.121594/1.1788848/melodifestivalbidrag_diskat|title=Melodifestivalbidrag diskat|date=2009-10-15|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=27 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202110746/http://svt.se/2.121594/1.1788848/melodifestivalbidrag_diskat|archivedate=2 December 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was replaced on 20 October 2009 by "You're Making Me Hot-Hot-Hot", written by [[Tobias Lundgren]], [[Johan Fransson (songwriter)|Johan Fransson]] and [[Tim Larsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14407|title=Melodifestivalen gets Hot Hot Hot|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2009-10-20|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.121594/1.1788846/orebrotrio_ersatter_diskat_bidrag|title=Örebrotrio ersätter diskat bidrag|date=2009-10-20|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=27 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130215700/http://svt.se/2.121594/1.1788846/orebrotrio_ersatter_diskat_bidrag|archivedate=30 November 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2009, the song "Åt helvete för sent" was disqualified by the public broadcaster of Sweden, SVT, because the decision on the artist to perform it ([[Rikard Wolff]], [[Sara Löfgren]] or [[Mathias Holmgren]]) was being obstructed by the team responsible for the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14541|title=Åt helvete för sent disqualified from Melodifestivalen|last=Hondal|first=Victor|date=2009-11-27|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The entry to replace the disqualified song was the song "The Saviour" by Henrik Janson and [[Tony Nilsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14541|title=Åt helvete för sent disqualified from Melodifestivalen|last=Hondal|first=Victor|date=2009-11-27|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New voting measures in the semi-finals were implemented, with the song receiving the most votes in the first round automatically qualifying to the final, skipping the second round.

===Semi-final 1===
The first semi-final was held on 6 February 2010 in [[Fjällräven Center]], [[Örnsköldsvik]]. One minute clips of the eight competing songs were released by SVT on 5 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15010|title=Sweden: First Melodifestivalen semi songs online|last=Murray|first=Gavin|date=2010-02-05|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first semi-final began with a performance by former Melodifestivalen contestants [[Charlotte Perrelli]], [[Nanne Grönvall]] and [[Sonja Aldén]] of the [[Bonnie Tyler]] song "[[Holding Out for a Hero]]".

The first performance of the night was by ''Andra Chansen'' participant in [[Melodifestivalen 2008]] [[Ola Svensson]], and his song "Unstoppable", an uptempo Europop song. Ola, dressed in casual clothes, was joined by a pianist, and gave a simple performance with effective use of light movement, and later using pyrotechnics. [[Jenny Silver]] was next on stage, performing her slow-tempo electronic number "A Place to Stay". Silver was dressed in a golden corset and a single steel glove on her left arm, and performed alone on stage to flashing lights in the background. [[Linda Pritchard]] performed her song "[[You're Making Me Hot-Hot-Hot]]", a strong dance number, next on stage. Pritchard was joined on stage by six female backing dancers, with dancing typically being an integral part of her stage performance. [[Heavy metal music|Metal]] band [[Pain of Salvation]] was next on stage, performing "[[Road Salt]]", a slow rock song. The band was dressed in casual clothes and gave a minimalist performance, with only lead vocals and keyboard performing and the remaining band members not playing.&lt;ref name="semi1ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15030|title=Live: First semi final in Sweden|last=Laufer|first=Gil|date=2010-02-06|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="semi1ref2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://escdaily.com/news/4400/|title=Sweden: Live from Örnsköldsvik, 1st semi-final of Melodifestivalen 2010|last=Backfish|first=Emma|date=2010-02-06|publisher=''ESCDaily''|accessdate=6 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210071825/http://escdaily.com/news/4400/|archivedate=10 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="semi1ref3"&gt;''Melodifestivalen 2010: Semi-final 1''. ''[[Sveriges Television]]'' (2010-02-06). Retrieved on 6 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth act to take the stage in Örnsköldsvik was [[Anders Ekborg]] and "The Saviour", with an operatic and theatrical beginning, later turning more rock-ish. Ekborg, dressed in a suit, was joined by six female backing singers/dancers. [[Jessica Andersson]], who represented Sweden at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003]] as a member of [[Fame (duo)|Fame]] next took the stage with "[[I Did It for Love (Jessica Andersson song)|I Did It for Love]]", a strong ballad. Andersson performed alone on stage in a navy dress, and the song builds to a large climax during the choruses, before ending slowly. The penultimate act was Frispråkarn and his hip-hop/rap song "Singel" (Single), the first song performed in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] in the contest, joined on stage by six female backing dancers/singers in black dresses. The final act on stage was wildcard entry [[Salem Al Fakir]] and his song "Keep on Walking". Al Fakir performed alone on stage playing from a grand piano, dressed in a grey suit, with changing colours featured prominently in the back and floor screens and on the piano keys.&lt;ref name="semi1ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="semi1ref2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="semi1ref3" /&gt;

After the end of the first round of voting [[Jenny Silver]], [[Frispråkarn]] and [[Anders Ekborg]] were eliminated from the competition after getting the fewest votes, coming 8th, 7th and 6th respectively. Furthermore [[Salem Al Fakir]] progressed to the final, after coming first in the televoting, leaving the remaining four acts to compete for the remaining places in the next round.

SVT experienced technical problems when broadcasting the first semi-final in [[High-definition television|high-definition]]. The first 30 minutes of the show were broadcast in normal resolution, and after this was corrected there was audio interference in HD, which affected the broadcast of "Road Salt" over HD. However, SVT chosen to give "Road Salt" 10 extra seconds in the first song summary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.121594/1.1878893/tekniskt_problem_med_melodifestivalens_forsta_deltavling?lid=senasteNytt_1793492&amp;lpos=rubrik_1878893|title=Tekniskt problem med Melodifestivalens första deltävling|date=2010-02-14|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=14 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210194039/http://svt.se/2.121594/1.1878893/tekniskt_problem_med_melodifestivalens_forsta_deltavling?lid=senasteNytt_1793492&amp;lpos=rubrik_1878893|archivedate=10 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semi-final 2's wildcard [[Pauline Kamusewu|Pauline]] was next to perform on stage, singing "Sucker for Love", a mid-60s style R'n'B song, a style not seen in Melodifestivalen before. Pauline and her backing dancers were all dressed in outfits from the period. Prolific Melodifestivalen competitor [[Andreas Johnson]], taking part in his fourth Melodifestivalen in five years, was next on the Sandviken stage with the song "[[We Can Work It Out (Andreas Johnson song)|We Can Work It Out]]". Johnson performed the strong ballad alone on stage in white light and dressed in green.

[[Hanna Lindblad]] was the last act to perform in Sandviken, performing the electric disco song "Manipulated". Lindblad and her backing dancers were dressed black skin-tight outfits for her performance.&lt;ref name="semi2ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="semi2ref2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="semi2ref3" /&gt;

===Semi-final 3===
The third semi-final was held on 20 February in [[Scandinavium]], [[Gothenburg]]. One minute clips of the eight competing songs were released by SVT on 19 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15139|title=Sweden: Snippets of third semi final songs online|last=Klier|first=Marcus|date=2010-02-19|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the eight performances and the first round of voting, [[Johannes Bah Kuhnke]], [[Elin Lanto]] and [[Getty Domein Mpanzu|Getty]] were eliminated from the contest, while [[Timoteij]] progressed direct to the final in Globen, leaving [[Alcazar (band)|Alcazar]], [[Erik Linder]], [[Darin Zanyar|Darin]] and [[Crucified Barbara]] to fight for the remaining places.&lt;ref name="semi3results1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15160 |title=Results: Two more acts qualified in Sweden |last=Medinika |first=Aija |date=2010-02-20 |publisher=''ESCToday'' |accessdate=20 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223063000/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15160 |archivedate=23 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="semi3results2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=9223&amp;_t=Melodifestivalen%3A+Globen+awaits+Timoteij+and+Darin|title=Melodifestivalen: Globen awaits Timoteij and Darin|last=Schacht|first=Andreas|date=2010-02-20|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=20 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was concern that Darin's song [[You're Out of My Life (Darin song)|"You're Out of My Life"]] would be disqualified after it was incorrectly made available to purchase during the week after the semi-final. A total of 54 downloads of the full studio version were made, making a #95 entry into the Swedish singles chart. However SVT confirmed that Darin would not be disqualified as the mistake was made by the distributor and not by Darin or his management. The song was subsequently taken off the music store, and was officially released later on, along with the rest of the competing Melodifestivalen songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://escdaily.com/news/5354/|title=Darin will not be disqualified over leak|date=2010-02-27|publisher=''ESCDaily''|accessdate=27 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304030744/http://escdaily.com/news/5354/|archivedate=4 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semi-final 4===
The fourth and final semi-final was held on 27 February in [[Malmö Arena]], [[Malmö]].

==Final==
The final of Melodifestivalen 2010 was held on 13 March 2010 at the [[Ericsson Globe|Globe Arena]] in [[Stockholm]]. 10 songs qualified for the final, two from each of the four semi-finals and the ''Andra Chansen'' round. The winner was decided by a mix of televoting/SMS voting and jury voting.

The running order for the final had been revealed on 7 March 2010. [[Darin Zanyar|Darin]]  opened the final with his song "[[You're Out of My Life (Darin song)|You're Out of My Life]]", and [[Eric Saade]] closed the performances with "[[Manboy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/15323|title=Running order for Melodifestivalen final announced|last=Hondal|first=Victor|date=2010-03-07|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=7 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308220658/http://esctoday.com/news/read/15323|archivedate=8 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the start of rehearsals [[Anna Bergendahl]] became the favourite to win the final with her song "[[This Is My Life (Anna Bergendahl song)|This Is My Life]]", leading with all Swedish bookmakers over [[Salem Al Fakir]] and [[Timoteij]].

'''Margaret Martin''' (1918/19 – December 1938) was a resident of [[Kingston, Pennsylvania]], United States, who went missing on December 17, 1938, and was found dead in [[Wyoming County, Pennsylvania]], several days later.&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt; Martin was a recent graduate of the [[Wilkes-Barre Business College]]. On December 17, 1938, she met an unknown man who claimed to be offering her a secretarial job, and was never seen alive again. Her body was discovered in the wilderness {{convert|25|mi|km}} away by a hunter four days later. Martin's death resulted in a lengthy manhunt. Numerous suspects were examined, but no one was ever convicted of the crime. As of {{currentyear}}, it remains an unsolved case and it is unlikely that the perpetrator will ever be discovered.

Margaret Martin was a resident of Kingston, in [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt; She graduated from [[Kingston High School (Pennsylvania)|Kingston High School]] in 1937.&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt; She took classes at the [[Wilkes-Barre Business College]] to gain secretarial skills and graduated with honors at the beginning of December 1938.&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt; She was 19 years old at the time of her death.&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"&gt;{{Citation|author = Erin L.

According to Betty Hopkins, a former classmate, Martin was "a shy, studious, friendly girl who had many friends".&lt;ref name = "timesleader"&gt;{{Citation|author = Joe Healy|newspaper = [[Times Leader]]|url = http://archives.timesleader.com/1999/1999_02/1999_01_24_A_GRUESOME_MURDER_THAT_WENT_UNSOLVED_WHO_KILLED_YOUNG_MARGARET_M.html|title = A gruesome murder that went unsolved: who killed young Margaret Martin?|date = January 24, 1999|accessdate = September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents described her as "a living saint".&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury"/&gt; She was also a devout Catholic.&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury2"&gt;{{Citation|newspaper = [[Pottstown Mercury]]|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3188770//|title = Sandy-Haired Man is Sought|page = 3|date = December 23, 1938|accessdate = September 9, 2015|via = [[newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin's father was John Martin, a local foreman and minor politician.&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury"/&gt; Margaret Martin was the eldest of four children.&lt;ref name = "bristoldailycourrier"&gt;{{Citation|newspaper = [[The Bristol Daily Courrier]]|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3189928//|title = Blame Sex Pervert for the Murder of 19-Year-Old Girl|page = 4|date = December 22, 1938|accessdate = September 9, 2015|via = [[newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On December 17, 1938, a man contacted Martin, claiming that he was setting up an insurance company and needed a [[secretary]],&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt; adding that he had heard of her through the Wilkes-Barre Business College.&lt;ref name = "chicagotribune"&gt;{{Citation|newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]]|url = http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1938/12/23/page/4/article/mother-and-victim|title = Mother and Victim|date = December 23, 1938|accessdate = September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two agreed to meet in Kingston Corners, not far from Martin's home.&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt;

Martin was first noted to be missing that evening, after she had failed to return home from the alleged job interview.&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt; Several witnesses said they had seen her getting into a brown Plymouth or black [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] with a man after a brief conversation.&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "timesmirror"&gt;{{Citation|newspaper = [[Warren Times Mirror]]|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3189812//|title = Inquest Being Held Today in Brutal Murder|page = 9|date = December 28, 1938|accessdate = September 9, 2015|via = [[newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last time she was seen alive.&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury2"/&gt; The witnesses were able to give only vague descriptions of the man, described as a "suave, neat, sandy-haired young man", and did not identify the car's license plate.&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt; The man was between 25 and 30 years of age and slightly overweight.&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury2"/&gt; Martin's friends and family called the police and started a search, but her disappearance was difficult to publicize since the local newspapers were on strike.&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt;

==Death and discovery of the body==
According to a 1999 article in the ''[[Times Leader]]'', Martin was tortured and murdered in a sawmill in the mountains about {{convert|15|mi|km}} from the creek where her body was found.&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt; According to theories by the police, the killer had attempted to dismember her body and destroy it in the mill's [[firebox (architecture)|firebox]], but had been scared off by the mill's owner, James Kedd. Kedd had assumed that the killer was a mere trespasser and had fired a warning shot in the killer's direction.&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt; The killer then drove to a point close to the creek and carried Martin's body the final 75 yards to the creek, where he abandoned it.&lt;ref name = "bristoldailycourrier"/&gt;

Initially, it was suspected that Martin's disappearance was linked to a [[sex slavery]] ring.&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury"/&gt; However, her body was discovered in the forested wilderness of [[Northmoreland Township, Wyoming County, Pennsylvania|Northmoreland Township, Wyoming County]], on December 21, 1938, about {{convert|25|mi|km}} from her home.&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "chicagotribune"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "gettysburgtimes"&gt;{{Citation|agency = [[Associated Press]]|newspaper = [[The Gettysburg Times]]|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3188480//|title = Find Shreds of Martin Clothes|date = December 29, 1938|accessdate = September 9, 2015|via = [[newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discoverer was 19-year-old Anthony Rezykowski, who was trapping [[muskrat]]s in the area.&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt; Rezykowski noticed a large burlap bag partially submerged in {{convert|2|ft|m}} of water in a creek.&lt;ref name = "bristoldailycourrier"/&gt; Upon further investigation, he found the bag to contain the mutilated body of a young woman with no clothing. The body was soon identified as Margaret Martin's.&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt; At the time of her body's discovery, she had been dead for at least 24 hours. If not for Rezykowski's discovery of her body, it may have gone unnoticed for several years.&lt;ref name = "bristoldailycourrier"/&gt;

Martin's body showed signs of having been beaten{{mdash}}perhaps with a rock{{mdash}}and strangled.&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt; She had bruises on her throat and body, as well as knife wounds on her stomach and thigh.&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt; Her [[autopsy]] found the cause of death to be strangulation and stated that she had "suffered the molestation of a degenerate".&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt;

==Initial investigations==
[[File:Investigators at the scene of the discovery of Margaret Martin's body.PNG|thumb|left|Investigators at the location where Martin's body was discovered]]
After the discovery of Martin's body, approximately 75 state troopers combed the area in search of clues.&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury2"/&gt; However, no tire tracks were seen near the site where her body was found, and the burlap bag proved to be of no use in identifying any suspects. According to ''[[The Citizens' Voice]]'', burned cloth matching the clothing Martin was wearing when she was last seen was discovered at an abandoned sawmill near [[Forkston, Pennsylvania|Forkston]].&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt; However, an article in ''[[The Kane Republican]]'' stated that this was not the origin of the cloth.&lt;ref name = "kanerepublican"/&gt; An incident involving a bundle of clothing being thrown from a car near [[Orwigsburg, Pennsylvania|Orwigsburg]] proved to be unrelated to Martin's killing.&lt;ref name = "gettysburgtimes"/&gt;

On December 22, the ''[[Scranton Tribune]]'' predicted that Martin's killer would be arrested within 24 hours.&lt;ref name = "pottstownmercury"&gt;{{Citation|newspaper = [[Pottstown Mercury]]|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3188592//|title = Mad Killer's Description Spurs Police Hunt for Girl's Slayer|page = 1|date = December 23, 1938|accessdate = September 9, 2015|via = [[newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many hundreds of people attended Martin's funeral at St.&amp;nbsp;Ignatius Church in Kingston on December 24.&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt; Plainclothes police officers also attended her funeral in the hopes of noticing anyone suspicious attending.&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt;

Several theories about the identity of Martin's murderer were suggested by locals. These included a [[mortician]] from Wyoming County, a businessman's son who left the area soon after the murder, a local assistant pastor, a teacher at the Wilkes-Barre Business College, and a local teenager who had a crush on Martin.&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt; Two men who had attempted to attack a 16-year-old girl from [[Hanover Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Hanover Township, Luzerne County]], were also investigated.&lt;ref name = "gettysburgtimes"/&gt; Some investigators believed that due to the killer's familiarity with the area's terrain, the killer must have been a local. More recently, it has been suggested that the killer was actually a non-local [[serial killer]].&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt;

==Impact and aftermath==
On December 28, 1938, Pennsylvania state senator [[Leo C. Mundy]] stated that at the next state legislature, he would introduce a bill making sex crimes punishable by execution and requiring registration for all sex offenders. Mundy had resolved to introduce the bill due to Martin's murder. Physicians and welfare and social service workers would also be required to report anyone with tendencies towards such offenses.&lt;ref name = "timesmirror"/&gt;

By the beginning of 1939, most clues pertaining to Martin's murder had proven to be useless.&lt;ref name = "kanerepublican"&gt;{{Citation|newspaper = [[The Kane Republican]]|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3189979//|title = Clews In Martin Murder Case Have About Vanished|page = 1|date = January 3, 1939|accessdate = September 9, 2015|via = [[newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manhunt for the killer was still ongoing in February of that year, but the police had not turned up any more information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|newspaper = [[The Indiana Gazette]]|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3190060//|title = Two-Month Manhunt Leaves Police Blank as to Killer of Martin Girl|page = 2|date = February 15, 1939|accessdate = September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1939, further clues were discovered, but the killer was not identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|newspaper = The Morning Herald|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3190099//|title = New Clues Found In Martin Death|page = 8|date = June 23, 1939|accessdate = September 9, 2015|via = [[newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a very large number of suspects were investigated after Martin's death, no perpetrator was ever identified.&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|newspaper = [[The Bristol Daily Courier]]|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3190191//|title = The Capitol Whirl|date = September 17, 1954|accessdate = September 9, 2015|via = [[newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1942, Orban Taylor of [[New York City]] confessed to Martin's murder. However, his confession was proven to be [[false confession|false]] after ten hours of investigation.&lt;ref name = "harrisburg"&gt;{{Citation|newspaper = [[Harrisburg Sunday Courier]]|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3190156//|title = Police Probe 4-Year Murder|page = 1|date = September 20, 1942|accessdate = September 9, 2015|via = [[newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor was not charged with that crime although he did confess to several other crimes.&lt;ref name = "citizensvoice"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "harrisburg"/&gt;

In 1948, a decade after Martin's murder, the case was one of the few major unsolved murders in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|newspaper = [[Pittston Gazette]]|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3190167//|title = Martin Girl Slain Ten Years Ago|page = 3|date = December 17, 1948|accessdate = September 9, 2015|via = [[newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Peter Paul Olszewski, Jr., who was at the time the Luzerne County District Attorney, stated that even with modern criminal investigation methods and forensic techniques, it is unlikely that the identity of Martin's killer will be discovered. It is presumed that the killer is now long-deceased.&lt;ref name = "timesleader"/&gt;

The '''New York International Fringe Festival''', or '''FringeNYC''', is a [[fringe theater]] festival and one of the largest multi-arts events in North America.  It takes place over the course of a few weeks in October, spread on more than 20 stages across several neighborhoods in downtown [[Manhattan]], notably the [[Lower East Side]], the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], and [[Greenwich Village]]. Most of the venues are centered around the FringeHUB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fringenyc.org/fringehub/|title= FringeHUB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance in 2009 topped 75,000 people.

Unlike most Fringe festivals, FringeNYC uses a jury-based selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/leaders-of-the-pack/ |title=Leaders of the Pack |last1=Jacobs |first1=Leonard |last2=Salomon |first2=Andrew| date=13 September 2006 |website=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]] |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 200 shows, out of a much larger pool of applicants, are selected for inclusion each year. However, from 2018 the Festival reduced the number of shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/theater/fringenyc-will-return-in-2018-in-a-smaller-version.html|title=FringeNYC Will Return in 2018, in a Smaller Version|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival was founded in 1997 by Aaron Beall, [[John Clancy (playwright)|John Clancy]], Jonathan Harris (also known as [[Ezra Buzzington]]), and (current Artistic Director) Elena K. Holy, and is produced by [[The Present Company]].

Notable shows that premiered at FringeNYC include ''[[Urinetown]]'', ''[[Dog Sees God]]'', the musical adaptation of ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'', and the American English-language premiere of ''[[The Black Rider]]''. Other feature shows included [[Charlie Victor Romeo]], which premiered at New York Lower East Side theatre [[Collective:Unconscious]].

FringeNYC includes many component events, such as FringeU (educational events), FringeART (art events), FringeAL FRESCO (free outdoor performances), and FringeJR (children's events).

At the conclusion of the festival around 20 shows are selected to participate in the FringeNYC Encore Series which runs for an additional two weeks in September.

'''No Limits Film Festival''' is an international student [[film festival]] held annually in [[Sheffield]], UK. It was the largest festival of its kind in the UK in 2010, screening over 140 films from 14 countries. The festival is run as a collaboration between students at [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Sheffield Hallam University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/forum/tm.asp?m=2593843&amp;mpage=1&amp;key=&amp;NID=0#2754569 |title=Sheffield 'No Limits' International Student Film Festival! |publisher=Empireonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name comes from the festival's 'no limits' policy on submissions. There are no restrictions on length, subject or content of films screened. Additionally, the organisers pledge to screen every film entered.

'The idea is to encourage young and aspiring [[filmmaker]]s to fully explore their creative and artistic potential. Show us what you've got! You don't need to be a film student to enter, just the vision and drive to make a film.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nolimitsfilmfestival.com/about.php |title=Film Festival &amp;#124; Cash Advance &amp;#124; Debt Consolidation &amp;#124; Insurance at |publisher=Nolimitsfilmfestival.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Submissions for the 2011 festival are planned to open on October 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vimeo.com/user3034160 |title=No Limits Student Film Festival on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2011-10-01 |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Novosti''''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Новости}}, lit. ''The News'') is a [[Croatia]]n weekly magazine based in [[Zagreb]]. It is published by the [[Serb National Council]] (SNV), the main state-funded body concerned with promotion of human rights and dealing with issues of ethnic identity and participation of Serbs in Croatia.&lt;ref name="SNVonama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snv.hr/about-snv/|title=About SNV|publisher=Serb National Council|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was established in July 1997 in Zagreb, based on the provisions granting the right to self-government for Serbs in Croatia as set in the [[Erdut Agreement]].&lt;ref name="SNVonama"/&gt;

The magazine, billed as an "independent Serb weekly" (''samostalni srpski tjednik''), describes its editorial policy as being primarily concerned with covering general news and publishing "critical writing about all the relevant political, social and cultural developments in Croatia". It also deals with issues related to the Serb community in Croatia and the development of [[civil society]].&lt;ref name="novostionama"/&gt;

The ''Novosti'' weekly was originally launched by SNV in December 1999 in [[broadsheet]] format as a weekly publication primarily concerned with [[minority politics]] related to [[Serbs of Croatia]].&lt;ref name="novostionama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novossti.com/o-novostima/|title=O Novostima|work=Novosti|language=Croatian|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its first issue the magazine adopted a policy of linguistic pluralism and featured articles written in both [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] varieties of [[Serbo-Croatian]], and offered a mix of sections printed in Latin and [[Cyrillic]] scripts.&lt;ref name="monitor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.hr/clanci/srpski-tjednik-novosti-od-pocetka-prosinca-na-kioscima/26482/|title=Srpski tjednik Novosti od početka prosinca na kioscima|date=17 November 2009|work=Internet Monitor|language=Croatian|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its circulation was limited to subscribers and was not widely available in [[newsstands]] for the first ten years of its existence.&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/srpski-tjednik-novosti-od-prosinca-na-kioscima-/460509.aspx|title=Srpske "Novosti" od prosinca u slobodnoj prodaji na hrvatskim kioscima|date=17 November 2009|work=[[Index.hr]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009 the magazine underwent an extensive makeover in an effort to transform it into a weekly magazine which would also appeal to the mainstream public, with more space dedicated to commentary pieces and coverage of nationally significant political and cultural events, as well as [[investigative journalism]].&lt;ref name="monitor"/&gt; To that extent, the magazine hired a number of prominent columnists and intellectuals as commentators, including [[Viktor Ivančić]] (formerly of ''[[Feral Tribune]]''), [[Boris Dežulović]], [[Vladimir Arsenijević]], [[Tomislav Jakić]] and [[Igor Mandić]], and was for the first time made available for purchase at newsstands.&lt;ref name="monitor"/&gt;

As of December 2009 its circulation is 8,000.&lt;ref name="index"/&gt; Its editor-in-chief is [[Ivica Đikić]], formerly of ''[[Novi list]]'' daily. Over the time magazine published interviews with [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref name="Intervju1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/noam-chomsky-trump-je-zastrasujuca-figura|title=Noam Chomsky: Trump je zastrašujuća figura|date=3 October 2016|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etgar Keret]],&lt;ref name="Intervju2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/etgar-keret-nacionalisti-utjehu-traze-na-krivim-mjestima|title=Etgar Keret: Nacionalisti utjehu traže na krivim mjestima|date=19 December 2016|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zygmunt Bauman]],&lt;ref name="Intervju3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/zygmunt-bauman-velika-avantura-zvana-evropa-jos-nije-okoncana|title=Zygmunt Bauman: Velika avantura zvana ‘Evropa’ još nije okončana|date=22 November 2016|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Giroux]],&lt;ref name="Intervju4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/henry-giroux-amerika-klizi-u-neofasizam|title=Henry Giroux: Amerika klizi u neofašizam|date=20 November 2016|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Srećko Horvat]],&lt;ref name="Intervju5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/srecko-horvat-nudimo-europski-nju-dil|title=Srećko Horvat: Nudimo europski New deal|date=23 August 2016|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milorad Pupovac]],&lt;ref name="Intervju6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/milorad-pupovac-potezi-predsjednice-su-nedopustivi-i-sramni|title=Milorad Pupovac: Potezi predsjednice su nedopustivi i sramni|date=9 December 2016|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Hedges]],&lt;ref name="Intervju7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/chris-hedges-trump-je-morbidni-simbol-amerike|title=Chris Hedges: Trump je morbidni simbol Amerike|date=4 July 2016|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Rancière]],&lt;ref name="Intervju8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/jacques-ranciere-ne-postoji-kljuc-za-buducnost|title=Jacques Rancière: Ne postoji ključ za budućnost|date=29 January 2016|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vivek Chibber]],&lt;ref name="Intervju9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/vivek-chibber-sto-znaci-imati-pravu-burzoaziju|title=Vivek Chibber Što znači ‘imati pravu buržoaziju’?|date=17 June 2015|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Filip David]],&lt;ref name="Intervju10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/filip-david-zlo-ima-bezbroj-lica|title=Filip David Zlo ima bezbroj lica|date=17 February 2015|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges Wolinski]],&lt;ref name="Intervju11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/georges-wolinski-najbolji-ljevicari-su-satiricari|title=Georges Wolinski Najbolji ljevičari su satiričari|date=7 January 2015|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mladen Ivanić]],&lt;ref name="Intervju12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/mladen-ivanic-mijenjat-cu-medjunarodni-imidz-republike-srpske-i-bih|title=Mladen Ivanić Mijenjat ću međunarodni imidž Republike Srpske i BiH|date=1 December 2014|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vesna Teršelič]],&lt;ref name="Intervju13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/vesna-terselic-obespravljene-su-civilne-zrtve-rata-a-ne-branitelji|title=Vesna Teršelič Obespravljene su civilne žrtve rata, a ne branitelji|date=10 November 2014|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrej Nikolaidis]],&lt;ref name="Intervju14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/andrej-nikolaidis-padne-li-syriza-dolazi-zlatna-zora|title=Andrej Nikolaidis Padne li Syriza, dolazi Zlatna zora|date=7 February 2015|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mirjana Karanović]].&lt;ref name="Intervju15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/mirjana-karanovic-ovaj-kusturica-nije-onaj-kojeg-sam-poznavala|title=Mirjana Karanović: Ovaj Kusturica nije onaj kojeg sam poznavala|date=12 November 2016|work=Novosti|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

[[Political satire]] and [[social commentary]] are integral part of Novosti editorial policy. This at some points caused strong criticism among some [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian nationalists]] with dogmatic views on historical events such as [[Croatian War of Independence]], who saw ridicule of [[militarism]], [[Croatian military]] and national symbols as unacceptable excess of limits of [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref name="Večernji1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/udruga-vigilare-napala-novosti-zbog-obrade-hrvatske-himne-1019574|title=Udruga Vigilare napala Novosti zbog obrade hrvatske himne|publisher=Večernji list|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="N1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hr.n1info.com/a134755/Vijesti/Od-Hrvatskog-radija-3-do-Hrvatskog-krugovala-3.html|title=Od Hrvatskog radija 3 do Hrvatskog krugovala 3|publisher=N1 TV|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/hr/uzroci-i-posljedice-kape-sa-slovom-u/a-19056213|title=Uzroci i posljedice kape sa slovom "U"|publisher=DW|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them were calling for cancellation of funding the newspapers from public money, criminal prosecution or [[censorship]].&lt;ref name="Večernji2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/hsp-podnio-kaznenu-prijavu-protiv-snv-a-tjednika-novosti-i-milorada-pupovca-1019141|title=HSP podnio kaznenu prijavu protiv SNV-a, tjednika Novosti i Milorada Pupovca|publisher=Večernji list|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[mainstream]] politicians in Croatia, including the president [[Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović]], warned the editors that they shall take care what they are writing about implicitly calling them to use [[self-censorship]].&lt;ref name="Predsjednica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.hr/danas/hrvatska/odgovor-na-dramaticno-pupovcevo-pismo-predsjednica-osudila-govor-mrznje-ali-i-napala-novosti-bivseg-premijera/|title=ODGOVOR NA PISMO: Predsjednica osudila govor mržnje, ali i napala Novosti, bivšeg premijera…|publisher=net.hr|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autofraf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autograf.hr/nikola-bajto-ja-pjevam-o-haubici-i-domoljubni-sam-pjesnik/|title=Nikola Bajto: "Ja pjevam o haubici i domoljubni sam pjesnik"|publisher=autograf.hr|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; President stated that she consider journal satire to be inappropriate and similar to cartoons of [[Muhammad]] in foreign press such as [[Charlie Hebdo]].&lt;ref name="Predsjednica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peščanik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pescanik.net/zemlja-nelagode/|title=Zemlja nelagode|publisher=Peščanik|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, 2017 [[Reporters Without Borders]] condemned ''"a campaign of lawsuits and verbal attacks that Croatian nationalist groups have been orchestrating for several months against Novosti, the newspaper of Croatia’s Serbian minority"''.&lt;ref name="RWB"/&gt; Some of the sentences published in Novosti that made part of the Croatian public feel insulted, were following:

Initiators of the petition for repeal of the funding refer to the same tender criterium which enabled the funding of Novosti weekly, which states: "''those who promote intolerance towards any national minority or majority, will be banned from contesting on [this] tender in period of 3 years''"&lt;ref name="ws_admin"/&gt;

'''Operation Quartz''' was a planned [[military operation]] to be conducted by the [[Rhodesian Security Forces|Rhodesian armed forces]] against [[Robert Mugabe]] and [[ZANU-PF]] in the event that party lost the [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980]]. The operation was organized on the assumption ZANU-PF would attempt to violently seize the government should it lose the election. ZANU-PF ultimately won the election and Operation Quartz was never executed.

==Planning==
[[File:President Zimbabwe , Robert Mugabe bezoekt Nederland Robert Mugabe , kop, Bestanddeelnr 932-1922.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Robert Mugabe, pictured here in 1982, was one of the targets of Operation Quartz.]]
Operation Quartz had two elements. The first involved strikes against armed units of the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA, ZANU-PF's military wing) that had concentrated at 11 assembly points prior to the election, to be carried out by Rhodesian infantry and armour units supported by the Rhodesian Air Force. The second element called for the simultaneous assassinations of Robert Mugabe, [[Rex Nhongo]], and [[Simon Muzenda]] by the [[Rhodesian SAS]].&lt;ref name="walls"/&gt;

In addition to the Rhodesian Army and Rhodesian Air Force, it is believed that the South African Armed Forces may have planned a supporting role in Operation Quartz.&lt;ref name="walls"/&gt;

Some accounts of Operation Quartz have inaccurately described it as a planned [[military coup]] against the extant government of [[Abel Muzorewa]] to prevent it from handing over power to Mugabe, alleging [[Peter Walls]] called off the operation three hours before [[H-Hour]]. The allegations may have originated in dubious information leaked by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moorcraft|first1=Paul|title=The Rhodesian War: A Military History|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=0811707253|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oL-jaeM63P8C&amp;dq=%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The ZANU-PF won a majority of votes in the election and Operation Quartz was never executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Licklider|first1=Roy|title=New Armies from Old: Merging Competing Military Forces After Civil Wars|date=2014|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=1626160430|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGGgAwAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ZANU-PF victory, details of Operation Quartz came to light and Walls, who had initially been retained by Mugabe as head of the armed forces, was accused in parliament of [[treason]].

'''''Riccardo primo, re d'Inghilterra''''' ("Richard the First, King of England", [[HWV]] 23) is an [[opera seria]] in three acts written by [[George Frideric Handel]] for the [[Royal Academy of Music (1719)]] . The Italian-language [[libretto]] was by [[Paolo Antonio Rolli]], after [[Francesco Briani]]'s ''Isacio tiranno'', set by [[Antonio Lotti]] in 1710. Handel wrote the work for the Royal Academy's 1726–27 opera season, and also as homage to the newly crowned [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and the nation where Handel had just received citizenship.&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;Dean, Winton, "Handel's ''Riccardo Primo''" (July 1964). ''[[The Musical Times]]'', '''105''' (1457): pp. 498–500.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Riccardo Primo'' was the third opera Handel composed for the trio of famous star Italian singers, the castrato [[Senesino]] and the sopranos [[Francesca Cuzzoni]] and [[Faustina Bordoni]].

==Performance history==
[[File:King George II by Charles Jervas.jpg|thumb|George II in his coronation robes]]
The opera received its premiere at the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] in London on 11 November 1727, and 11 subsequent performances. It was also performed in Hamburg and Braunschweig in February 1729.&lt;ref&gt;Händel, ''Riccardo primo, Re d'Inghilterra''. ed. Andreas Köhs. piano reduction. Bärenreiter 2007, Kassel p. X&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamburg performance, led by none other than [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], included two new comic characters, Murmilla and Gelasius; [[recitative]]s and the added [[aria]]s for the new characters were translated into German although the original arias remained in Italian. Handel subsequently re-used music from the opera in ''[[Scipione]]'' and ''[[Tolomeo]]''. The opera fell into neglect after the 1728 closing of the Royal Academy.&lt;ref name="Dean" /&gt;

''Riccardo Primo'' was rediscovered and performed by the [[Handel Opera Society]] at [[Sadler's Wells Opera]] in London on 8 July 1964.&lt;ref name="Dean2"&gt;Dean, Winton, "Handel Operas" (September 1964). ''The Musical Times'', '''105''' (1459): pp. 670–671.&lt;/ref&gt; Later performances were given at [[Kourion]] Amphitheater in Cyprus at 1991, in order to mark the 800th anniversary of the historical events on which the opera is based, at the 1996 [[Göttingen International Handel Festival|Göttingen Festival]]&lt;ref name="Drakeford"&gt;Drakeford, Richard, "Festival Reviews: Virtue &amp; Pleasure" (September 1996).

==Synopsis==
:Time: 1191
:Place: Cyprus

The story concerns the marriage of [[Richard I of England]] to Constanza, a [[Spain|Spanish]] princess. The character of Costanza is identified with [[Berengaria of Navarre]], who married Richard I at [[Limassol]] at 1191.
[Prior to the action of the opera, Riccardo and Costanza have not yet met.]

===Act 1===
''Cyprus''

On her sea journey to be married to Riccardo, Costanza and her party are shipwrecked off the coast of Cyprus.  She finds shelter at the court of the local governor, Isacio, pretending that she and her tutor, Berardo, are actually brother and sister, Doride and Narsete, servants of Costanza. Oronte (engaged to Pulcheria) is attracted to 'Doride'. Pulcheria overhears him paying court and is angry. Riccardo arrives, disguised as his kingdom's ambassador, and asks after Costanza.  Isacio guesses "Doride's" real identity and promises to give up Costanza to Riccardo.

===Act 2===
[[File:Merry-Joseph Blondel - Richard I the Lionheart.jpg|left|thumb| Richard I the Lionheart]]
Isacio, knowing that Riccardo has never seen his fiancée, proposes to send his daughter Pulcheria to Riccardo in her stead, leaving the way open for his seduction of Costanza, whom he forces to admit her real identity. Pulcheria agrees, out of duty to her father, but intends to reveal the deception at the right moment. Oronte has discovered Isacio's plot through Berardo and stops it at the moment that Riccardo and Pulcheria meet for the first time, which leads Pulcheria to forgive her fiancé.  Riccardo is angry upon learning of Isacio's designs and proposes to overthrow the tyrant in alliance with Oronte. He retains his disguise and plans to offer charity towards Isacio in spite of the ill plotting.  Speaking "on behalf" of Riccardo, "the Ambassador" offers Isacio the choice of either peace or war.  Pulcheria pleads for Costanza and Isacio agrees to bestow her on Riccardo.  Pulcheria introduces Riccardo, initially as the 'ambassador, but then revealed as his true self, to Costanza, and act 2 closes with a love duet for Costanza and Riccardo.

===Act 3===
Riccardo tells Oronte how Isacio has gone back on his word and launched an attack against Riccardo at the moment that he was about to leave with Costanza. Despite the help of Oronte's forces, Costanza is taken back by Isacio. Pulcheria, seeing the captive Costnza's distress, offers herself as a hostage to Riccardo's forces. Isacio offers his prisoner his hand in marriage and his throne. Berardo intervenes to announce the renewed approach of the English army. Isacio is defiant. As Riccardo bursts into the palace, Isacio threatens to kill Costanza. As Riccardo is about to concede, Pulcheria seizes a sword and announces she will kill herself if Costanza is harmed. In the following confusion Oronte enters and his superior forces prompt Isacio to flee.

==Context and analysis==
[[File:London Kings Theatre Haymarket.jpg|thumb|The King's Theatre, London, where ''Riccardo Primo'' had its first performance]]
The German-born Handel, after spending some of his early career composing operas and other pieces in Italy, settled in London, where in 1711 he had introduced Italian opera for the first time with his opera ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]''. A tremendous success, ''Rinaldo'' created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. In 1719, Handel was appointed [[Kapellmeister|music director]] of an organisation called the Royal Academy of Music (unconnected with the present-day London conservatoire), a company under royal charter to produce Italian operas in London. Handel was not only to compose operas for the company but hire the star singers, supervise the orchestra and musicians, and adapt operas from Italy for London performance.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, W. &amp; J.M. Knapp (1995) ''Handel's operas 1704–1726,'' p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qw8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA273 |title=Essays on Handel and Italian opera by Reinhard Strohm |via=[[Google Books]] |date= |accessdate=2013-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handel had composed numerous Italian operas for the Academy, with varying degrees of success; some were enormously popular. The castrato Senesino and the soprano Francesca Cuzzoni had appeared in a succession of Handel operas for the Academy (he was not the only composer who composed operas for the company) most of which had been successful with audiences, and in 1726 the directors of the Academy brought over another internationally renowned singer, [[Faustina Bordoni]], to add to the company's attractions. The two [[prima donna]]s had appeared in continental European countries in operas together without incident, but in London they developed rival groups of fans who interrupted the performances with rowdy displays of partisanship for one lady or another. This came to a climax on 6 June 1727 during a performance at the King's Theatre of ''Astianatte'' by [[Giovanni Bononcini]] with both singers onstage and royalty in the audience. Fist fights and disorder between rival groups of fans broke out in the audience and the two sopranos exchanged insults and came to blows onstage. The rest of the opera was cut, the performers going straight to the short final chorus. The scandal was gleefully repeated in the newspapers, in satirical skits on other stages, and in mock-heroic verse, bringing the entire form of Italian opera into a certain amount of disrepute in London.&lt;ref name=House/&gt;

Handel had to supply another opera for the trio of star singers, Senesino, Cuzzoni and Faustina (as she was known) even though these singers received astronomical fees, much more than he received for composing the works.&lt;ref name=Snowman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snowman|first1=Daniel|title=The Gilded Stage: A Social History of Opera|date=2010|publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1-84354-466-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with declining audience numbers caused at least in part by the ridicule brought upon Italian opera by the rival sopranos' public spat, these factors were causing severe financial difficulty for the Royal Academy of Music. As one of Handel's most loyal supporters, [[Mary Delaney]], wrote in 1727:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I doubt operas will not survive longer than this winter, they are now at their last gasp; the subscription is expired and nobody will renew it. The directors are all squabbling, and they have so many divisions among themselves that I wonder they have not broke up before. Senesino goes away next winter, and I believe Faustina, so you see harmony is almost out of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burrows|first1=Donald|title=Handel (Master Musicians)|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973736-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Royal Academy of Music collapsed at the end of the 1728–29 season, partly due to the huge fees paid to the star singers, and Cuzzoni and Faustina both left London for engagements in continental Europe. Handel started a new opera company with a new prima donna, [[Anna Strada]]. One of Handel's librettists, [[Paolo Antonio Rolli|Paolo Rolli]], wrote in a letter (the original is in Italian) that Handel said that Strada "sings better than the two who have left us, because one of them (Faustina) never pleased him at all and he would like to forget the other (Cuzzoni)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lotario|url=https://handelhendrix.org/learn/about-handel/opera-synopses/lotario/|website=handelhendrix.org|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera was not revived by Handel, although to 18th century musicologist [[Charles Burney]] it contained much fine music, including an aria for Faustina, ''Vado per obedirti'', which: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is the most agreeable song of execution of the times. I have been told that the brilliancy of her voice made its way through the busy accompaniment of this song in a manner which filled the whole theatre. A close in this air appears for the first time, which has since become fashionable, as well as the return to the subject in the Da Capo.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Burney: ''A General History of Music: from the Earliest Ages to the Present Period.'' Vol. 4. London 1789, reprint: Cambridge University Press 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-108-01642-1}}, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
R.B. Chatwin has discussed Handel's writing of orchestral parts for the [[chalumeau]], a forerunner of the [[clarinet]], as part of the [[Musicology|musicological]] controversy over whether or not Handel wrote music for the clarinet or its precursors.&lt;ref&gt;Chatwin, R.B., "Handel and the Clarinet" (March 1950). ''The [[Galpin Society]] Journal'', '''3''': pp. 3–8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winton Dean]] and [[Richard Drakeford]] have commented on the weaknesses of the dramatic characterisations in the libretto.&lt;ref name="Dean" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drakeford" /&gt;

The opera is scored for recorder, flute, bass flute or two chalumeaux, two oboes, bassoon, three trumpets, two horns, timpani, strings and [[Figured bass|continuo]] (cello, lute, harpsichord).

The '''National Day Rally''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 国庆群众大会, {{lang-ms|Rapat Umum Hari Kebangsaan}}) is an annual address that the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] makes to the entire nation, on the first or second Sunday after [[National Day (Singapore)|National Day]] on 9 August.&lt;ref name=from&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/from-babies-to-casinos-10-memorable-national-day-rally-speeches |title=From babies to casinos: 11 memorable National Day Rally speeches |last=Chew |first=Hui Min |date=20 August 2016 |work=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A yearly event since 1966, the Prime Minister uses the rally to address the nation on its key challenges and announce major policy changes, and is comparable to the [[State of the Union]] address delivered by the [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mothership.sg/2016/08/pm-lee-mentions-pokemon-in-his-national-day-rally-trailer/ |first=Martino |last=Tan |title=PM Lee mentions "Pokémon" in his National Day rally trailer |date=20 August 2016 |work=[[Mothership.sg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The rally began in 1966 as a "private meeting" between the Prime Minister and community leaders. The transcript was released to the media only two weeks later. Only in 1971 did [[Lee Kuan Yew]] decide "at the last minute" to televise the speech, which has since been annually broadcast live.&lt;ref name=from /&gt;

The first rally in 1966 was held on the eve of National Day. Since 1967, the rally has been held at least a week after National Day.

The rally was delivered at the former [[Singapore National Theatre|National Theatre]] from 1966 to 1983. With the theatre's closure and demolishment in 1984, the rally was held at the [[Singapore Conference Hall]] for two years before being shifted to [[Kallang Theatre]] from 1986 to 2000. In 2001, the rally moved to the University Cultural Centre at the [[National University of Singapore]]. Since 2013, [[Lee Hsien Loong]] has held his rally at the [[ITE College Central|ITE Headquarters and ITE College Central]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pm-lee-to-deliver/724994.html | title=PM Lee to deliver National Day Rally speech at ITE Headquarters and College Central | work = [[Channel NewsAsia]] | publisher = [[Mediacorp]] | accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1966 National Day Rally===

The first National Day Rally was held on 8 August 1966 at the [[Singapore National Theatre|National Theatre]]. A closed-door meeting, Lee Kuan Yew told community leaders, "Every year, on this 9th August for many years ahead - how many, I do not know - we will dedicate ourselves anew to consolidate ourselves to survive; and, most important of all, to find an enduring future for what we have built and what our forebears will build up."&lt;ref name=from /&gt;

===1971 National Day Rally===

The 1971 rally was the first to be televised, at Lee Kuan Yew's "last minute" decision. Since then, the rally has become "a fixture on the political calendar".&lt;ref name=from /&gt;

Lee delivered his "cautiously optimistic" speech "off the cuff", remarking, "You have done well - six superb years, a magnificent performance against all the odds, so much so that everybody says, 'But, of course, everybody knows that Singapore is a very well-endowed place...Oh, just natural course of events.' It wasn't, you know. We made it so..."&lt;ref name=from /&gt;

===1981 National Day Rally===

The 1981 rally marked the first time where [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]] ministers delivered their speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/audiovisual_records/record-details/483c0dcb-1164-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad | title=National Day Rally - Speeches By Dr Tony Tan, Lim Chee Onn, Goh Chok Tong And Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1983 National Day Rally===

At the 1983 rally, Lee Kuan Yew "trotted out facts and figures to show that the more highly educated a woman was, the less likely she was to reproduce", before concluding, "[W]e are really discarding our able parents in the next generation and doubling the less able." The resulting controversy eroded electoral support for his [[People's Action Party]] for several years.&lt;ref name=from /&gt;

===1988 National Day Rally===

In 1988, Lee Kuan Yew delivered "one of his most quoted lines": "And even from my sick bed, even if you are going to lower me into the grave, and I feel that something is going wrong, I'll get up."&lt;ref name=from /&gt;

===1991 National Day Rally===

In 1991, [[Goh Chok Tong]] delivered his maiden speech at the National Day Rally. He "spoke with a self-deprecating humour that heralded a new, gentler style of governance", which he underscored by remarking, "I am not going to follow [Lee Kuan Yew's] act. I am going to walk my own way."&lt;ref name=from /&gt;

===2002 National Day Rally===

At the 2002 rally, Goh Chok Tong remarked, "Fair-weather Singaporeans will run away whenever the country runs into stormy weather. I call them 'quitters'. Fortunately, 'quitters' are in the minority. The majority of Singaporeans are 'stayers'...As we say in Hokkien, 'pah see buay zao'." His labels generated "much discussion".&lt;ref name=from /&gt;

===2004 National Day Rally===

In 2004, [[Lee Hsien Loong]] made his maiden address at the National Day Rally. However, rather than deliver a "cautious speech", he "surprised many by slaughtering a few sacred cows". He promoted a new "teach less, learn more" education policy, introduced a shortened five-day work week for the [[Singapore Civil Service|Civil Service]], and, most controversially, mooted the idea of casinos in Singapore.&lt;ref name=from /&gt; In 1970, Lee Kuan Yew's response to casinos in Singapore had been "no, not over my dead body", though the elder Lee had since changed his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/his-decades-parliament |date=27 March 2015 |title=His decades in Parliament |work=[[The New Paper]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 National Day Rally===

In 2005, [[Lee Hsien Loong]] adopted the current format of delivering his Malay and Chinese remarks at 6:45 pm, with a break at 7:30 pm, before commencing his English address at 8:00pm. Prior to 2005, the rally was a continuous speech from 8:00pm.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===2007 National Day Rally===

In 2007, opposition and [[Nominated Members of Parliament]] were invited to the National Day Rally for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/opposition-parties-hold-outreach-events |title=Opposition parties hold outreach events |date=24 August 2015 |last=Chong |first=Zi Liang |work=[[The Straits Times]] |location=[[Singapore]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 National Day Rally===

In 2008, the English language telecast of the rally, initially scheduled for live broadcast at 8pm on 17 August, was postponed to the next day. The move was to allow Singaporeans to watch Singapore take on [[China]] in the women's table tennis finals at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]]. The rally itself proceeded as usual at the University Cultural Centre, but was only broadcast the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Broadcast of National Day Rally English speech postponed to Monday | work = [[Channel NewsAsia]] | publisher = [[Mediacorp]] | date = 16 August 2007 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/368702/1/.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 National Day Rally===

In 2009, Singaporeans used the [[Twitter]] hashtag #ndrsg to tweet about the rally.

===2010 National Day Rally===

The 2010 rally was held on the last Sunday of August to avoid clashing with the [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|Youth Olympic Games]] earlier that month.

===2012 National Day Rally===

The 2012 rally marked the second time where [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]] ministers delivered their speeches at 6.45pm, before the Prime Minister's remarks at 8pm. It was also the first to feature sign-language translation in real time.&lt;ref name=from /&gt; It was held on the last Sunday of August to facilitate [[Hari Raya|Ramadan]] festivities.

===2013 National Day Rally===

The 2013 rally was the first to be held at the [[ITE College Central|ITE Headquarters and ITE College Central]] after nine years at the [[National University of Singapore]]'s University Cultural Centre.&lt;ref name=from /&gt; Lee said the move was "for a serious purpose - to underscore my longstanding commitment to investing in…every Singaporean".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pmo.gov.sg/newsroom/prime-minister-lee-hsien-loongs-national-day-rally-2013-english |title=Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally 2013 (English) |website=[[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister's Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 National Day Rally===
In his 2015 speech, "set within the context of...[[Singaporean general election, 2015|an impending general election]]", [[Lee Hsien Loong]] "asked for a strong mandate" without being "baldly partisan". Lee also mentioned two ministers, [[Vivian Balakrishnan]] and [[Lim Swee Say]], who would respectively be standing in [[Holland-Bukit Timah GRC]] and [[East Coast GRC]], the two most contested [[People's Action Party|PAP]]-held constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipscommons.sg/the-politics-of-the-ndr-2015-speech/ |first=Gillian |last=Koh |date=24 August 2015 |website=[[Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore)|Institute of Policy Studies]] |title=[The Angle] The Politics of the NDR 2015 Speech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 National Day Rally ===
An hour and 20 minutes into his English remarks at the 2016 rally, Lee Hsien Loong suddenly took ill at 9.20pm. Half an hour later, [[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Teo Chee Hean]] announced that Lee would resume his speech. The [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister's Office]] also said that Lee had felt "unsteady because of prolonged standing, heat and dehydration", adding, "His heart is fine and he did not have a stroke." At 10.40pm, he returned to speak for another 15 minutes. By then, he looked well and thanked the audience for waiting for him, who gave him a standing ovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/anxiety-then-relief-as-pm-completes-rally-after-taking-ill|title=Anxiety, then relief, as PM Lee Hsien Loong completes rally after taking ill|last=hermes|date=2016-08-21|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 National Day Rally===
The 2017 rally was held on 20 August 2017 at ITE College Central. Lee's speech mainly focused on the obstacles which Singapore was currently facing, namely [[Diabetes]], [[Pre-school]] and [[Technology]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/national-day-rally-2017-six-key-takeaways-9140632|title=National Day Rally 2017: Six key takeaways|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 National Day Rally===
The 2018 rally was held at the ITE College Central on 19 August 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/national-day-rally-2018-to-be-held-on-aug-19|title=National Day Rally 2018 to be held on Aug 19|first=|last=hermesauto|date=19 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the rally focused on trending issues such as housing, healthcare and cost of living. Lee introduced, among other policies, the Merdeka Generation Package (a spin-off from the [[Pioneer Generation Package]]), the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme and a revamped Home Improvement Programme. He also announced that Singapore would be seeking a second inscription on [[UNESCO]]'s World Heritage List of [[hawker centre#In Singapore|her hawker culture]], and that Senior Minister of State and Mayor [[Maliki Osman]] would be leading an improvement project for [[Geylang Serai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pm-lee-national-day-rally-ndr-2018-things-you-need-to-know-10631096|title=National Day Rally 2018: The 8 things you need to know|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==

===Broadcast===

The programme used to be aired as a single slot programme from 8 pm onwards. Since 2005, the rally is usually broadcast live from 6.45pm till 10pm (SST), with a break between 7.30pm and 8pm (the break was extended to 8.15 pm from 2017 onwards), across [[MediaCorp]] channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/specialreport/news/367942_74/1/.html|title=MediaCorp to broadcast PM Lee's Nat'l Day Rally Speech "live" Sunday|accessdate=14 August 2008 | work = [[Channel NewsAsia]] | publisher = [[Mediacorp]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most English rallies were over-run and most programmes on MediaCorp had postponed to the following week but some programmes were shown immediately after the English rally. Most programmes on MediaCorp would resume earlier at 9:30pm or later at 11:00pm if the rally over-ran the scheduled time.

An article titled "Singapore's National Day Rally Speech: A Site of Ideological Negotiation"&lt;ref name="Tan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tan | first = Kenneth Paul | title = Singapore's National Day Rally speech: A site of ideological negotiation | journal = [[Journal of Contemporary Asia]] | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 292–308 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00472330701408635 | date = August 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00472330701408635 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Also available [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Singapore's+National+Day+Rally+speech:+a+site+of+ideological...-a0168089152 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; analyses the inaugural National Day Rally speeches of three Singapore prime ministers. It locates these speeches in the continuous ideological work that the People's Action Party (PAP) government has to do to maintain consensus and forge new alliances among classes and social forces that are being transformed by globalisation. Increasingly, these speeches have had to deal with the contradictions between nation-building and the tensions between the liberal and reactionary tendencies of the global city.

According to Kenneth Paul Tan of the Lee Kuan Yew school of Public Policy:&lt;ref name="Tan" /&gt;
"The rally speech has also been a part of larger celebrations surrounding the commemoration of Singapore's independence gained on 9th August 1965. These celebrations have come to include a short and formal televised National Day message from the Prime Minister, observance ceremonies held at organizations in the public and private sectors, constituency dinners and ministerial speeches, regularly televised music videos of patriotic songs composed for the celebrations, and - most spectacular of all - a National Day parade that since the mid-1980s has included not only a traditional ceremonial segment , but also high-tech mass performances and re-enactments of the official "Singapore Story" that end on a climax of fireworks (Kong and Yeoh, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kong|first1=Lily|last2=Yeoh|first2=Brenda S.A. | title = The construction of national identity through the production of ritual and spectacle | journal = [[Political Geography (journal)|Political Geography]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 213–239 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0962-6298(95)00135-2 | date = March 1997 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0962-6298(95)00135-2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly the symbolic and formal aspects of the speech are just as important as its contents, taking Singaporeans collectively to an emotional high. This is especially so during general election years, when the prime minister announces the PAP's "report card" of achievements in government as well as the distribution of election "goodies" to the Singaporean masses - the lower income voters in particular - as a way of reinforcing the image of government as benevolent provider."

"As an annual injection of patriotism, the National Day celebrations help to inoculate Singaporeans against the disenchantment that accompanies advanced industrial societies, whether they are formally classified as capitalist or socialist, democratic or authoritarian. Singaporeans are reminded every year of the PAP's pioneer leaders - Lee Kuan yew and his "lieutenants" (Lam and Tan,1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Er|editor-first1=Lam Peng|editor-last2=Tan|editor-first2=Kevin Yl|title=Lee's lieutenants: Singapore's old guard|date=2000|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=St. Leonards, NSW.|isbn=9781864486391}}&lt;/ref&gt; - who have been written  into the official "Singapore Story" as the brave and far-sighted founders of contemporary Singapore (Loh,1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loh|first=Kah Seng | title = ‘No more road to walk’: cultures of heritage and leprosariums in Singapore and Malaysia | journal = International Journal of Heritage Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 230–244 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13527258.2011.556660 | date = May 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13527258.2011.556660 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both volumes of Lee's own memoirs - tellingly titled ''the Singapore Story''  - have become central texts of the Singapore Story, supplemented by glossy publications such as the National Heritage Boards (1998) ''Singapore: Journey Into nationhood'' as well as other educational and information materials"

"The PAP knows that its authority will be secure as long as it remains able to make Singaporeans believe that it can continue to deliver material prosperity and security for all, regardless of race. Therefore, the PAP has had to reassert its relevance constantly by insisting on Singapore's fundamentally vulnerable nature and condition, an insistence that has sustained a culture of fear and arrested the risky global environment, the PAP also knows that the transactional basis on which its authority is built has become fragile and therefore needs to be strengthened by moral authority, what Burns (1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=James MacGregor | title = Leadership |date=2010|publisher=HarperPerennial|location=New York|isbn=9780061965579|edition=1st |series = Harper Perennial Political Classics Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; has identified as a transformative mode of leadership, through which it can uplift, inspire and motivate in times of real crisis."

The '''Sknyliv air show disaster''' occurred on 27 July 2002, when a [[Ukrainian Air Force]] [[Sukhoi Su-27]] piloted by Volodymyr Toponar and co-piloted by Yuriy Yegorov crashed during an [[aerobatics]] presentation at [[Sknyliv|Sknyliv airfield]] near [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]. The accident killed 77 people and injured 543, 100 of whom were hospitalised. {{As of|2002|alt=}}&lt;!-- Template output suppressed in lede, as inline template doesn't display in tooltip previews. --&gt;, it was [[Lists of air show accidents and incidents|the deadliest air show accident in history]].

== Accident ==
More than 10,000 spectators attended the Saturday [[air show]], staged to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the [[Ukrainian Air Force]]'s 14th Air Corps.&lt;ref name="CurDi-2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dlib.eastview.com/browse/doc/13715639|title=EVXpress – Deadly Performance.

It rolled upright once more and was still descending rapidly when the left wing dropped shortly before it hit the ground, at which point the crew initiated ejection. The aircraft flattened out initially, skidding over the ground towards stationary aircraft and striking a glancing blow against the nose of an [[Ilyushin Il-76]] transport aircraft before beginning to explode and cartwheel into the crowd of spectators.

Both pilots survived with minor injuries, while 77 spectators were killed, including 28 children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kozyrieva|first1=Tetiana|title=Two Sknyliv boys seven years later|url=http://www.day.kiev.ua/en/article/society/two-sknyliv-boys-seven-years-later|access-date=27 June 2015|work=[[The Day (newspaper)|The Day]]|date=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though initial reports by the Emergency Situations Ministry put the number of dead at 83, including 23 children).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Horodetska|first=Olena|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-89911650/pilots-blamed-for-world-s-worst-air-show-disaster|title=Pilots Blamed for World's Worst Air Show Disaster|date=30 July 2002|newspaper=[[Birmingham Post]]|access-date=23 May 2015|subscription=yes|via=[[Questia Online Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 100 were hospitalized for head injuries, burns, and bone fractures.&lt;ref name="CurDi-2002"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Deadly Performance.

Following the disaster, the pilots stated that the flight map which they had received differed from the actual layout.  On the [[Flight recorder#Cockpit voice recorder|cockpit voice recorder]], one pilot asks, "And where are our spectators?"&lt;ref name="femalevoice"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dlib.eastview.com/browse/doc/13716213|title=EVXpress – Ukrainian Pilots Failed to Obey Female Voice – The Current Digest of the Russian Press, 2002, No. 31, Vol. 54|website=dlib.eastview.com|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have suggested that the pilots were slow to react to automated warnings issued by the flight computer.&lt;ref name="femalevoice" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Ukrainian President [[Leonid Kuchma]] publicly blamed the military for the disaster and dismissed head of the air force, General Viktor Strelnykov.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2160690.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Defense minister [[Volodymyr Shkidchenko]] sent in his resignation, but Kuchma rejected it.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2178539.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ukraine crash report blames pilots | date=7 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2005, a military court sentenced pilot Volodymyr Toponar and co-pilot Yuriy Yegorov to 14 and 8 years in prison, respectively.  The court found the two pilots and three other military officials guilty of failing to follow orders, negligence, and violating flight rules. Two of the three officials were sentenced to up to six years in prison, and the last official received up to four years. In addition, Toponar was ordered to pay 7.2 million [[Ukrainian hryvnia]] ([[United States dollar|US$]]1.42 million; [[Euro|€]]1.18 million) in compensation to the families, and Yegorov 2.5 million hryvnia. The crew's main flight trainer was acquitted for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/06/24/ukraine.airshow/ ''CNN news report, 24 June 2005''] (after the verdict)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/leadnews/190074-1.html ''Aviation Web news report, 29 June 2005''] (after the verdict)&lt;/ref&gt;  After the verdict was announced, Toponar said that he planned to appeal, insisting that the crash was due to technical problems and a faulty flight plan. Yegorov was released in 2008 after President Yushchenko issued a decree reducing his sentence to three and a half years.&lt;ref name="ukrainian weekly"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/archive/pdf3/2012/The_Ukrainian_Weekly_2012-34.pdf  | title=Lviv area residents remember Sknyliv air show disaster of 2002 | date=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilots were assigned the majority of the blame, which included accusations of attempting maneuvers with which they were not experienced. Toponar had requested an additional training flight at the airfield where the display was to be performed; this request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200208/08/eng20020808_101150.shtml  ''People's Daily'' news report, 8 August 2002] (12 days after the accident)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southern Decadence''' is an annual six-day event held in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] by the [[homosexuality|gay and lesbian]] community during Labor Day Weekend, climaxing with a parade through the [[French Quarter]] on the Sunday before [[Labor Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Samantha |title=The Rough Guide to New Orleans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCHlDQcmZ6gC&amp;pg=PA181-IA3&amp;dq=%22Southern+Decadence%22+new+orleans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b6TnULeHN5P88QTXjoDoDg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Southern%20Decadence%22%20new%20orleans&amp;f=false |year=2010 |publisher=Rough Guides |location=London |isbn=9781405385558 |page=180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karlin |first1=Adam |last2=Dunford |first2=Lisa|title=New Orleans City Guide |year=2009 |publisher=Lonely Planet |location=London |isbn=9781741048339 |pages=15, 240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The event traces its beginnings to August 1972, as a party among a group of 40–50 friends both straight and gay.  They billed their event as "Southern Decadence Party: Come As Your Favorite Southern Decadent."  People who attended were required to dress as their favorite [[decadence|decadent]] [[Southern United States|Southerner]].  The first small "parade" occurred the following year, when the participants first met at [[Johnny Matassa's Bar]]&lt;ref&gt;Sears, James Thomas. ''Rebels, Rubyfruit, and Rhinestones: Queering Space in the Stonewall South''. (Chapel Hill, N.C.: Rutgers University Press, 2001) 97.&lt;/ref&gt; in the French Quarter to show off their costumes and then walk back home in the [[Tremé]] neighborhood via Esplanade Avenue.  This first group impersonated people and characters ranging from Belle Watling (the prostitute character in ''[[Gone With the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'') and  [[Mary Ann Mobley]] to [[Tallulah Bankhead]] and [[Helen Keller]].  The event expanded with Frederick Douglas Wright, an African American,&lt;ref&gt;Sears, James Thomas. ''Rebels, Rubyfruit, and Rhinestones: Queering Space in the Stonewall South''. (Chapel Hill, N.C.: Rutgers University Press, 2001) 98.&lt;/ref&gt; appointed as the first Grand Marshal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southerndecadence.net/grand-marshal.htm |title= Southern Decadence Grand Marshals |work=Southern Decadence |accessdate=June 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by members of the original group in 1974, who would have complete control over the parade of incredible characters and costumes as they marched through the French Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southerndecadence.net/history.htm |title= The History of Southern Decadence: New Orleans' Largest Gay Event |work=Southern Decadence |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Decadence, as it is commonly known by participants, is marked by parades, bead tossing, street parties and dance parties. In these ways it resembles [[New Orleans Mardi Gras]], however, Southern Decadence tends to be more sexual in tone and is generally geared towards more upscale and mature revelers.  Decadence crowds in the Quarter typically match or exceed Mardi Gras crowds.  Most events take place in or around the French Quarter neighborhood centered at the intersection of Bourbon and St. Ann streets.

Crowds range from 100,000 to 300,000 revelers from across the nation and world.  In 2017, there were over 200,000 participants and the positive economic impact on the City of New Orleans was estimated at over $250&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southerndecadence.net/|title= Southern Decadence Official Website |work=Southern Decadence |accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Decadence caters primarily to gay men, but is still lesbian friendly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southerndecadence.net/faq.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dykes on Bikes]] participate in the annual parade in the French Quarter and [[Dykeadence]] sponsors several events for lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Howard Philips and Frank Perez, ''Southern Decadence in New Orleans'', (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Themes were presented on and off from the beginning, but did not become a consistent fixture of the event until "Plagues, Pests, Parasites" theme in 1988.  They have been featured every year that the Decadence has been held since then.  They have ranged from themes as varied as "Voodoo That You Do", "Menage à Trois", "Ancient Truths, Lies, and Sacrifice", and "Hurricane: This Year, They Blow Back."&lt;ref name=themes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southerndecadence.net/theme.htm |title=Official Southern Decadence Theme, Colors and Song |work=Southern Decadence |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme for 2018 is "House of Bourbon -- Unleash Your Beast."  The official colors are Royal Blue and Canary Yellow. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southerndecadence.net/|title=Official Southern Decadence Website|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=Southern Decadence|accessdate=June 22, 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
In years past, religious and conservative groups have rallied against the festival. In 2003 there was a formal petition filed to have the event terminated, with video footage handed over to officials depicting dozens of men engaged in "public sex acts". There were examples of men exposing themselves to others for beads, similar to the way women have long exposed their breasts for the traditional Mardi Gras balcony bead toss.   The complaints led to a vocal response from business owners and hoteliers in New Orleans, in support of the festival.  Ultimately the police posted notices clarifying what constitutes public sex.  The pastor who spearheaded, videotaped, and filed the petition, Grant Storms was arrested in February 2011 after being caught masturbating in a public park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2011/02/man_booked_with_masturbating_a.html |title=Southern Decadence protest leader booked with masturbating at Metairie park |work=The Times-Picayune |publisher=New Orleans Net LLC |author=Michelle Hunter |date=March 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was convicted of obscenity on August 22, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2012/08/rev_grant_storms_critic_of_sou.html |title=Rev.

The city later passed an ordinance that effectively banned the dissemination of any social, political, or religious message on Bourbon Street from sunrise to sunset, punishable by up to six months in jail and a $500 fine.  City Councilwoman Kristin Palmer, who sponsored the ordinance, said the city "has a legitimate interest in protecting residents and visitors in the highly trafficked area of [[Bourbon Street]] at night. She said aggressive solicitation can be a crowd-control issue, and people are allowed under the law to speak their messages if they take five steps off Bourbon Street. This is really an issue of trying to protect public safety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2012/09/preachers_arrested_during_sout.html |title=Preachers, activists arrested during Southern Decadence to challenge ban |work=The Times-Picayune |publisher=New Orleans Net LLC |author=Katherine Fretland |date=September 10, 2012 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nine preachers and activists were subsequently arrested on September 1, 2012, after they allegedly yelled slurs at people attending Southern Decadence on Bourbon Street. Represented by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] during the first round of their case, those arrested saw the law temporarily suspended via a restraining order that was granted by a federal judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2012/09/aclu_wins_round_in_fight_for_f.html |title=ACLU wins round in fight for French Quarter preachers |work=The Times-Picayune |publisher=New Orleans Net LLC |author=Bruce Nolan |date=September 21, 2012 |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellations==

===Hurricane Katrina===
In the year 2005, that year's edition of Southern Decadence was officially canceled in the wake of safety precautions against [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/3215824 |title=Hurricane Ends Plans for Southern Decadence |work=Chicago Pride |date=August 30, 2005 |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a very small group of residents who still remained in the French Quarter celebrated the event anyway.  An abbreviated [[parade]] took place in the French Quarter with some two dozen participants. Most were French Quarter hold-outs; there were also at least a couple of people who had to wade in through flooded streets from other neighborhoods to get there.  As the city was officially being evacuated at the time, a [[police]] officer at first attempted to stop the small observation of tradition, but one of the participants was able to produce the parade permit issued pre-Katrina showing it was a scheduled legal event, and the small procession was allowed to continue. National media reporters noted the event.  It was the first parade in New Orleans after the hurricane, the most recent previous New Orleans parade having been the [[Krewe of OAK]] "Midsummer Mardi Gras" parade the night before the city's mandatory evacuation.

With the theme "Southern Decadence Rebirth", the event rebounded in 2006, attracting near-normal crowds.

===Hurricane Gustav===
Due to the approach of [[Hurricane Gustav]] in 2008 and a mandatory evacuation notice, some events on Saturday and all official Southern Decadence events after Sunday, August 31 midday were canceled that year.  As a result of Sunday's parade being canceled, the 2008 Southern Decadence Grand Marshals, Paloma (Samson Utley) and Tittie Toulouse (Gary Delaune), returned for 2009. However, as was the case with 2005, a small group of French Quarter residents still celebrated the 2008 event anyway with an "unofficial" parade taking place once again in the [[French Quarter]]. That parade had some two-dozen participants, just like three years earlier.

With the theme "Hurricane: This Year, They Blow Back", the event once again rebounded as a whole in 2009, attracting near-normal crowds.

The '''statute of frauds''' refers to the requirement that certain kinds of [[contract]]s be memorialized in writing, signed by the party to be charged, with sufficient content to evidence the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drachsler|first1=Leo M.|title=The British Statute of Frauds - British Reform and American Experience|journal=Section of International and Comparative Law Bulletin|date=1958|volume=3|issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The list of contracts that fall under a traditional statute of frauds can be remembered by using the [[mnemonic]] "MY LEGS": '''M'''arriage, contracts for more than one '''Y'''ear, '''L'''and, '''E'''xecutor (or '''E'''state), '''G'''oods ($500.00 or more), '''S'''urety.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the statute of frauds requires a signed writing in the following circumstances:
:* Contracts in [[consideration]] of [[marriage]]. This provision covers prenuptial agreements.
:* Contracts that cannot be performed within one year. However, contracts of indefinite duration do not fall under the statute of frauds regardless of how long the performance actually takes.
:* Contracts for the transfer of an interest in land. This applies not only to a contract to sell land but also to any other contract in which land or an interest in it is disposed, such as the grant of a mortgage or an easement.
:* Contracts by the [[executor]] of a [[will (law)|will]] to pay a debt of the estate with his own money.
:* Contracts for the sale of goods totaling $500.00 or more.
:* Contracts in which one party becomes a [[surety]] (acts as guarantor) for another party's debt or other obligation.

In an action for [[specific performance]] of a contract to convey land, the agreement must be in writing to satisfy the statute of frauds. The statute is satisfied if the contract to convey is evidenced by a writing or writings containing the essential terms of a purchase and sale agreement and signed by the party against whom the contract is to be enforced. If there is no written agreement, a court of equity can specifically enforce an oral agreement to convey only if the part performance doctrine is satisfied. In most jurisdictions, part performance is proven when the purchaser pays the purchase price, has possession of the land and makes improvements on the land, all with the permission of the seller. No jurisdiction is satisfied by payment of the purchase price alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170511090326/http://www.cs.xu.edu/~osborn/main/lawSchool/contractsHtml/bottomScreens/Briefs/Restatement%20129.%20Action%20in%20Reliance;%20Specific%20Performance.htm Restatement (Second) of the Law of Contracts § 129]. American Law Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[common law]], the statute of frauds also applies to contract modifications. For example, in an oral agreement for the lease of a car for nine months, immediately after taking possession, the lessor then decides that he really likes the car and makes an oral offer to the lessee to extend the term of the lease by an additional six months. Although neither agreement alone comes under the statute of frauds, the oral extension modifies the original contract to make it a fifteen-month lease (nine months plus the additional six), thereby bringing it under the statute as the contract now exceeds twelve months in duration. In theory, the same principle works in reverse as well, such that an agreement to reduce a lease from fifteen months to nine months would not require a writing. However, many jurisdictions have enacted statutes that require a writing for such situations.

==Terminology==
The term ''statute of frauds'' comes from an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England]] (29 Chas. 2 c. 3) passed in 1677 (authored by [[Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Nottingham]] assisted by Sir [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], Sir [[Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford|Francis North]] and Sir [[Leoline Jenkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Cosgigan Jr., George P.|year= 1913|title=The Date and Authorship of Statute of Frauds  |journal= [[Harvard Law Review]] |volume= 26|issue= |pages=329 at 334–42 |publisher= |doi= 10.2307/1326318|pmid= |pmc= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and passed by the [[Cavalier Parliament]]), the [[long title|title]] of which is '''An Act for Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries'''.&lt;ref&gt;'Charles II, 1677: An Act for prevention of Frauds and Perjuryes.', Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628-80 (1991), pp. 839-42.{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47463|title= Report|author=|publisher=|date=|work=|accessdate=6 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[common law]] jurisdictions have made similar [[statutory law|statutory provisions]], while a number of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions have equivalent legislation incorporated into their [[civil code]]s. The original English statute itself may still be in effect in a number of Canadian provinces, depending on the constitutional or [[reception statute]] of [[English law]], and any subsequent legislative developments.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Raising the defense==
A defendant in a contract case who wants to use the statute of frauds as a [[Defense (legal)|defense]] must raise it as an [[affirmative defense]] in a timely manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbert|first1=M.J.|title=Procedure and Promise: Rethinking the Admissions Exception to the Statute of Frauds under UCC Articles 2, 2A, and 8|journal=Oklahoma Law Review|date=Summer 1992|volume=45|issue=2|page=203|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/oklrv45&amp;div=20&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burden of proving that a written contract exists comes into play only when a statute of frauds defense is raised by the defendant.

==Exceptions==
An agreement may be enforced even if it does not comply with the statute of frauds in the following situations:
:* A statute of frauds defense may also be affected by a showing of '''part performance''' by proving the existence of one of two different conditions. If the parties have taken action in reliance on the agreement, as in the case ''Riley v. Capital Airlines, Inc.'', the court held that part performance does not take an executory portion of a contract out of the statute of frauds. Each performance constitutes a contract that falls outside the Statute of Frauds and was enforceable to the extent it is executed. However, the unexecuted portion of the contract falls within the Statute of Frauds and is unenforceable. As a result, only the executed portion of the contract can be recovered, and the doctrine of part performance does not remove the contract from the statute. On the other hand, the court, in ''Schwedes v. Romain'', held that partial performance and grounds for [[estoppel]] can make the contract effective.
:* '''[[Promissory estoppel]]''' can be applied in many but not all jurisdictions when the charging party detrimentally relies on the otherwise unenforceable contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review and American Law Register |year=1931 |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=440–464 |title=The Doctrine of Estoppel Applied to the Statute of Frauds |first=Lionel Morgan |last=Summers |doi= |jstor=3307890 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In England and Wales, the circumstances where promissory estoppel may be used to overcome the statute are limited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Actionstrength Ltd (t/a Vital Resources) v. International Glass Engineering In.Gl.En. SpA &amp; Ors|link=|court=UKHL|year=2003|num=17|para=|parallelcite=[2003] 2 AC 541|date=3 April 2003|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some jurisdictions deny this possibility altogether.
:* The '''"main purpose rule"''' as it relates to guarantee or suretyship type contracts: where the promisor's promise to answer for the debt of another is made mainly for the promisor's own economic advantage, then it is a primary promise, and enforceable even without a writing.
:* '''Easements by implication''': [[easement]]s, which are agreements that permit the use of real estate by someone who has no property interest in the land, may be created by operation of law rather than by written instrument. This may happen where, for example, a piece of land is partitioned between owners and pre-existing utilities routes or access paths that would otherwise be trespassory over one of the plots is reasonably necessary for enjoyment of the other plot. In such case, the pre-existing use must be apparent and continuous at the time of the partition for an easement to be created by implication. The implied easement constitutes an interest in land that does not require a writing to be enforceable.

In the United States, for contracts for the sale of goods that fall under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], additional exceptions may apply:
:* '''Admission''' of the existence of a contract by the defendant under oath.&lt;ref&gt;U.C.C. 2-201(3)(b)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the contract would only exist for the quantity of goods that were admitted.&lt;ref name="Mann12thEd"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mann |first1=Richard A. |last2=Roberts |first2=Barry S. |date=2015 |title=Business Law and the Regulation of Business |edition=12th |publisher=Cengage Learning |place=Boston, MA 02210 |isbn=978-1-305-50955-9 |lccn=2015949710}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if the contract was for 100 televisions but the seller admitted in court that it was for 70 televisions, then the contract would exist only for 70 televisions and not the original 100. 
:* '''Merchant confirmation rule'''. If one [[merchant]] sends a writing sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds to another merchant and the receiving merchant has reason to know of the contents of the sent confirmation and does not object to the confirmation within 10 days, the confirmation is good to satisfy the statute as to both parties, even if the confirmation was not signed by the party to be charged.&lt;ref&gt;U.C.C.  2-201(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The goods were '''specially manufactured''' for the buyer and the seller either 1) began manufacturing them, or 2) entered into a third party contract for their manufacture, and the manufacturer cannot without undue burden sell the goods to another person in the seller's ordinary course of business: for example, T-shirts with a Little League baseball team logo or wall-to-wall carpeting for an odd-sized room.&lt;ref&gt;U.C.C. 2-201(3)(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
The Statute of Frauds recites that it was enacted for the ". . . prevention of many fraudulent practices which are commonly endeavored to be upheld by perjury . . .". The mischief arising from claimants asserting oral agreements was to be avoided by requiring that certain contracts be evidenced by "some memorandum or note thereof . . . in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith . . .". Contracts respecting land "created by livery and seisen only or by parole" would not be enforced absent such a writing.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

It quickly became apparent to the common law judges that the Statute might itself become an instrument of fraud (or at least injustice) if it was strictly enforced with respect to contracts that were wholly or partly performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hill v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) (1997)|url=http://beta.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1997/1997canlii401/1997canlii401.html|website=CanLII|publisher=lexum|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts developed the concept of "part performance" as an exception. If a contract concerning land was partly performed, that could displace the need for a note or memorandum in writing signed by the party to be charged.

It was one thing to create an exception that displaced the need for a memorandum in writing, but something else to completely nullify the Statute's operation. The thrust of the Statute was that contracts concerning land could not be proved by parol evidence alone. Thus, part performance might be an exception, but it could not, in effect, mean that the underlying contract could be proven by parol evidence. In developing the "part performance" exception, a balancing of the competing considerations was required. An important factor in the case law became that the part performance must be "unequivocally" related to the alleged contract.&lt;ref&gt;Deglman v Guaranty Trust Co. of Canada and Constantineau, [1954] S.C.R. 725 https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2738/index.do&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
The Statute of Frauds was passed in 1695 in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statute of Frauds 1695 - An Act for Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1695/act/12/enacted/en/html|website=eISB|publisher=Government of Ireland|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statute is one of the few pre-Independence laws that survived the Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act 2005 and the Statute Law Revision Act 2007, and remains largely in force today.

Some effects of the law have been softened by equity, for example the requirement that all contracts for sale of land be evidenced in writing can be circumvented by reliance on the doctrine of part performance.

===England and Wales===
{{See also|Formalities in English law}}
The [[Statute of Frauds]]&lt;ref&gt;This [[short title]] was given by the [[Short Titles Act 1896]]. It is written here as printed in "The Public General Acts, 1896", HMSO, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; (1677) was largely repealed in England and Wales by the [[Law Reform (Enforcement of Contracts) Act 1954]] (2 &amp; 3 Eliz 2 c 34). The only provision of it extant is part of Section&amp;nbsp;4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statute of Frauds (1677), Sec. IV|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Cha2/29/3/section/IV|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that contracts of guarantee ([[surety]] for another's debt) are unenforceable unless evidenced in writing. This requirement is clarified by section 3 of the [[Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856, Sec. 3|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/19-20/97/section/3|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (19 &amp; 20 Vict 97) which provides that the [[consideration (law)|consideration]] for the guarantee need not appear in writing or by necessary inference from a written document.

Section 6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828, Sec. 6|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo4/9/14/section/6|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archive|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828]]&lt;ref&gt;This [[short title]] was given by the [[Short Titles Act 1896]]&lt;/ref&gt; (9 Geo 4 c 14) (commonly known as '''Lord Tenterden's Act''')&lt;ref&gt;Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 16th Edition, 1989, Sweet and Maxwell, paragraph 18-41, at page 1036&lt;/ref&gt; was enacted to prevent Section 4 being circumvented by bringing an action against a verbal guarantor for the [[tort of deceit]] (the tort in ''Freeman v. Palsey'').&lt;ref&gt;(1789) 3[[Term Reports|TR]] 51&lt;/ref&gt; A common summary of the law is "a verbal guarantee (for a debt) isn't worth the paper it is written on".

Provisions in section 4 as to formalities for contracts for the sale of land were repealed by Schedule 7 to the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] (15 Geo 5 c 20), however the requirement that contracts for the sale of land be evidenced in writing was maintained by section 40 of that Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law of Property Act 1925, Sec. 40|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/40/enacted|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=National Archive|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently replaced by section 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989, Sec. 2|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/34/section/2|website=legislation.co.uk|publisher=The National Archive|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989]] (c 34).

===Scotland===
Section 6 of the [[Mercantile Law Amendment Act Scotland 1856]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercantile Law Amendment Act Scotland 1856, c. 60, s. VI|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/19-20/60/section/VI/enacted|website=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; was derived from those parts of section 4 of the Statute of Frauds (1677) which relate to contracts of guarantee and from section 6 of the Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828.

It was repealed on 1 August 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercantile Law Amendment Act Scotland 1856|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/19-20/60/section/6|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archive|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/section/15|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archive|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995]], sections 14(2)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995, Sec. 14|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/section/14|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archive|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Schedule 5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995, Schedule 5|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/schedule/5|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archive|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with ss. 9(3)(5)(7), 13, 14(3)).

==United States==

===State laws===
Every state has a statute that requires certain types of contracts to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged. The most common requirements are for contracts that involve the sale or transfer of land, and contracts that cannot be completed within one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/statute_of_frauds|title=Statute of frauds|first=LII|last=Staff|date=6 August 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the statute of frauds applies, a typical statute requires that the writing commemorating the agreement identify the contracting parties, recite the subject matter of the contract so that it is reasonably identifiable, and include the important terms and conditions of agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=The Statute of Frauds and Contract Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/statute_of_frauds.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=4 September 2017|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statute of frauds in various states comes in three types:
# those that follow the English statute and provide that "no action shall be brought" on the contract or the contract "shall not be enforced" 
# Those that declare contracts "void"&lt;ref&gt;3 Williston, Contracts §§526, 527 (3d ed. Jager 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Those that make the contract "voidable" at the affected party's election &lt;ref&gt;e.g. Tex. Gov't Code Sec. 82.065 (a)(b) (contingent fee contract for legal services. http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.82.htm#82.065&lt;/ref&gt;

====Texas====
In addition to the statute of frauds as conventionally defined,&lt;ref&gt;The Statute of Frauds generally renders a contract that falls within its purview unenforceable unless an exception applies. TEX. BUS. &amp; COM. CODE § 26.01(a).&lt;/ref&gt;  the State of Texas has two rules that govern the litigation process, each of which also has the character of a statute of frauds. One is a rule of general applicability and requires agreements between counsel (or a party, if self-represented) to be in writing to be enforceable. Tex. R. Civ. P. 11.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11 provides as follows: Unless otherwise provided in these rules, no agreement between attorneys or parties touching any suit pending will be enforced unless it be in writing, signed and filed with the papers as part of the record, or unless it be made in open court and entered of record. http://www.txcourts.gov/media/1435952/trcp-all-updated-with-amendments-effective-january-1-2018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Rule 11 Agreements=====
Agreements under this rule are called "Rule 11 Agreements" and may either concern settlement or any procedural aspect, such as an agreement regarding scheduling, continuances of trial settings, or discovery matters. The rule has existed since 1840 and has contained the filing requirement since 1877.&lt;ref&gt;See Kennedy v. Hyde, 682 S.W.2d 525, 526 (Tex.1984) (tracing the history of Rule 11); Birdwell v. Cox, 18 Tex. 535, 537 (1857) (providing rationale for in-writing requirement).&lt;/ref&gt;  The number designation can cause confusion to non-Texas attorneys because the federal rule 11 is the sanctions rule, whose state-court counterpart has the number designation 13 under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (TRCP).

=====Contracts for Legal Services=====
The other rule that is in the nature of a statute of frauds governs fee agreements with clients when the attorney is to be compensated based on the outcome of the case. The Texas Government Code requires that "[a] contingent fee contract for legal services must be in writing and signed by the attorney and client." TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 82.065(a).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.82.htm#82.065&lt;/ref&gt;  
The classic example is a contingent fee contract in a personal injury case that provides for the claimant's lawyer to receive a certain percentage of the settlement amount (or of the amount awarded by judgment) net of litigation costs, with the percentages typically staggered and increasing based on whether a settlement was obtained before lawsuit is filed, after a lawsuit was filed but before trial, or whether a judgment favorable to the client was obtained through trial. The other scenario is a contingency fee contract based on cost savings achieved (for a client who is a defendant sued for a money judgment) or based on other specified litigation objectives. In those cases, the client will not recover any money from his opponent in the lawsuit, and will have to pay his attorney from his or her own funds in accordance with the terms of the agreement, once the matter is concluded favorably. When the client does not pay, some attorneys then sue the client on the contingency fee contract, or in quantum meruit in the alternative. See, e.g., Shamoun &amp; Norman, LLP v. Hill, 483 S.W.3d 767 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2016), reversed on other grounds by Hill v. Shamoun &amp; Norman, LLP, No. 16-0107 (Tex. April 13, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.txcourts.gov/media/1441370/160107.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The attorney-vs-client fee-dispute issue generally does not arise in personal injury cases because the settlement funds from the settling party or judgment-debtor are disbursed through the attorney of the party entitled to them, net of costs and the contingency fee component.

===Uniform Commercial Code===

In addition to general statutes of frauds, under Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC), every state except Louisiana has adopted an additional statute of frauds that relates to the sale of goods. Pursuant to the UCC, contracts for the sale of [[good (economics)|good]]s where the price equals $500 or more fall under the statute of frauds, with the exceptions for professional merchants performing their normal business transactions, and for any custom-made items designed for one specific buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{UCC|2|201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of the statute of frauds to dealings between [[merchant]]s has been modified by provisions of the UCC. There is a "catch-all" provision in the UCC for [[personal property]] not covered by any other specific law,&lt;ref&gt;{{UCC|1|206}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that a contract for the sale of such property where the purchase price exceeds $500 is not enforceable unless memorialized by a signed writing. The most recent UCC revision increases the triggering point for the UCC Statute of Frauds to $5,000, but states have been slow to amend their versions of the statute to increase the trigger point.

For purposes of the UCC, a defendant who admits the existence of the contract in his pleadings, under oath in a [[deposition (law)|deposition]] or affidavit, or at trial, may not use the statute of frauds as a defense. However, a statute of frauds defense may still be available under a state's the general statute.

With respect to [[security (finance)|securities]] transactions, the Uniform Commercial Code has abrogated the statute of frauds.&lt;ref&gt;{{UCC|8|319}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drafters of the most recent revision commented that "with the increasing use of electronic means of communication, the statute of frauds is unsuited to the realities of the securities business."

'''Stenograffia''' is an international [[graffiti]] festival held annually in [[Yekaterinburg]] the first weekend in July. In the summer of 2010 graffiti on the theme "Europe and Asia: the clash of opposites" appeared in the subways, on quay slabs, yards, and on buildings in the [[Ural Federal District|Ural]] capital. The theme of Stenograffia 2011 was "Images of Happiness". In July 2012 artists from around the world will present their vision of Yekaterinburg using the theme "Global Intelligence".

== Description ==

The first festival gathered artists from 25 cities and three countries. It included artists from [[Omsk]], [[Moscow]], [[St. Petersburg]], [[Murmansk]], [[Ufa]], [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Irkutsk]], [[Chelyabinsk]], [[Tomsk]], [[Nizhny Tagil]], [[Perm]], [[Kemerovo]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Nizhny]] and [[Novgorod]], and from ([[Spain]] and [[Germany]]. The gathering occasioned a large-scale painting of urban surfaces.

The '''Stockholm Water Festival''' ({{lang-sv|Stockholms vattenfestival}}) was an annual [[street festival]] held in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in August from 1991 to 1999. The festival featured many activities in central Stockholm, but was eventually cancelled after the 1999 festival due to lack of funds.

During the Stockholm Water Festival of 1993, a [[JAS 39 Gripen]] aircraft crashed at the island of [[Långholmen]] in central Stockholm during a display of the new aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iToQ2FykoI&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the crash occurring near thousands of spectators, only one person on the ground was injured.&lt;ref&gt;A woman was hospitalized for three weeks for burns.

'''Theophobos''' ({{lang-el|Θεόφοβος}}) or '''Theophobus''', originally '''Nasir''' ({{lang|fa|ناصر}}), '''Nasr''' ({{lang|fa|نصر}}), or '''Nusayr''' ({{lang|fa|نصیر}}),{{sfn|Bosworth|1991|p=3 (Footnote #10)}} was an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] commander of the [[Khurramites]] who converted to [[Christianity]] and entered [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] service under Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] (r. 829–843).{{sfn|Venetis|2005}} Raised to high rank and married into the imperial family, Theophobos was given command of his fellow Khurramites and served under Theophilos in his wars against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in 837–838. After the Byzantines' defeat at the [[Battle of Anzen]], he was proclaimed emperor by his own men, but did not pursue this claim. Instead he peacefully submitted to Theophilos in the next year and was apparently pardoned, until he was executed by the dying emperor in 842 to prevent a challenge to the accession of [[Michael III]].

==Biography==
[[File:Theophilus follis.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''[[Follis]]'' of Emperor Theophilos.]]
Theophobos was born to a family originally belonging to the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] aristocracy.{{sfn|Venetis|2005}} He was originally a member of the [[Khurramites|Khurramite]] sect in western [[Greater Iran|Iran]], which was being persecuted by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. In October/November 833, they were defeated by the armies of Caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]] (r. 833–842) under Ishaq ibn Ibrahim.{{sfn|Venetis|2005}}{{sfn|ODB|loc="Theophobos", pp. 2067–2068}} Thus, in 834, Nasr with some fourteen thousand other Khurramites, crossed the [[Armenian highland]] and fled to the [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfn|Venetis|2005}}{{sfn|Rekaya|1977|pp=46–47}} There, they converted to [[Christianity]], were given widows from military families as wives, and enrolled into the [[Byzantine army]] in the so-called "Persian ''[[tourma]]''".{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=439}} Nasr, now [[baptism|baptized]] Theophobos ("fearful/respectful of God"), was placed at the head of these troops, raised to the rank of ''[[patrikios]]'' and given the hand of either Theophilos's sister or a sister of Empress [[Theodora (9th century)|Theodora]] in marriage.{{sfn|Venetis|2005}}{{sfn|ODB|loc="Theophobos", pp. 2067–2068}} The addition of the "Persian" corps greatly strengthened the Byzantine military: not only were its members implacable enemies of the Arabs, but they may have raised the number of effectives in the Byzantine army by as much as a sixth.{{sfn|Venetis|2005}}

Already in 837, Theophobos and the new Khurramite corps campaigned with Theophilos in his campaign in the region of the Upper [[Euphrates]] around [[Melitene]], where they brutally sacked the city of Zapetra.{{sfn|Rekaya|1977|p=64}}{{sfn|Rosser|1974|pp=268–269}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|pp=440–441}} In September of the same year, some 16,000 more Khurramites fled into the Byzantine Empire, following the final suppression of their movement by the Abbasid army.{{sfn|Venetis|2005}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=441}}

Theophobos also participated in the campaign of 838 against al-Mu'tasim's retaliatory invasion. He was present at the catastrophic Byzantine defeat at the [[Battle of Anzen]], where he according to some accounts saved the emperor's life (other accounts credit [[Manuel the Armenian]] with the feat).{{sfn|Venetis|2005}}{{sfn|Rosser|1974|pp=268–269}}{{sfn|Rekaya|1977|p=63}} In the aftermath of the battle, however, the "Persian" troops assembled at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] and declared Theophobos emperor, most likely against his will.{{sfn|Rosser|1974|pp=268–269}} The exact reason behind this move or the exact sequence of events are unclear. However, after the defeat at Anzen, the rumour had spread to [[Constantinople]] that Theophilos had been killed, and it appears that Theophobos, who was possibly an [[iconodule]] (as opposed to the staunchly [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclast]] Theophilos) was suggested by some among the Byzantine Empire's elite as the new emperor.{{sfn|ODB|loc="Theophobos", pp. 2067–2068}}{{sfn|Rosser|1974|pp=268–269}}

[[File:The head of Theophobos is brought to Emperor Theophilos on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The head of Theophobos is brought to Emperor Theophilos on his deathbed.]]
Despite being proclaimed and crowned—probably according to [[Sasanian]] ritual—by his men, Theophobos made no move against Theophilos, and the "Persian" troops remained quiescent at Sinope.{{sfn|Venetis|2005}} Instead, he quickly engaged in secret negotiations with the emperor, who in 839 led an army against the rebels. Theophobos agreed to surrender and was restored to his high offices, while his men, numbering some 30,000, were reportedly split up into regiments of 2000 men and divided among the ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|themata]]''.{{sfn|ODB|loc="Theophobos", pp. 2067–2068}}{{sfn|Rosser|1974|p=271}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|pp=442–443}} Theophobos was restored to his previous high position in the army, but this was not to last. Islamic sources report that he died in battle in 839 or 840, but the Byzantine sources contain a different, and more likely, account: in 842, Theophilos, already in declining health and about to die, had Theophobos executed by his brother-in-law [[Petronas (general)|Petronas]] in order to secure the succession of his infant son and heir, [[Michael III]] (r. 842–867).{{sfn|Venetis|2005}}{{sfn|ODB|loc="Petronas", pp. 1644–1645; "Theophobos", pp. 2067–2068}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=445}}

The events that sparked the rallies began during the [[2013 Shahbag protests|shahbag protest]] when Bangladeshis rallied on the streets to demand capital punishment for [[Abdul Quader Molla]], a war criminal of the [[Bangladesh liberation war]] and a leader of [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami]]. During the protests, [[Ahmed Rajib Haider]], a blogger who was critical of Jamaat-e-Islami, was stabbed to death by Jamaat activists&lt;ref name=Blogger_killed-2&gt;{{cite news|title=Shahbagh protest to go relentless|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/02/15/shahbagh-protest-to-go-relentless|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=bdnews24.com|date=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another controversial author, blogger &amp; online activist named [[Sunnyur Rahman]], popularly known as 'Nastik Nobi' (Atheist Prophet) in the blog community, was also stabbed on 7 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;

Members of hardline Muslim group, Hifazat-e-Islam, backed by Jamaat, began a violent protest demanding authorities enact harsh anti-blasphemy laws to punish those who insult Islam, calling the bloggers "anti-Islamic" and terming all participants of the shahbag movement "[[Atheism|atheists]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hardline Muslims rally in Bangladesh amid shutdown| publisher=Associated Press| date=6 April 2013| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/04/06/hardline-muslims-rally-bangladesh/2058851/| accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
