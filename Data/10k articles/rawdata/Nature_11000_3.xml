[[File:AT0102 map.png|thumb|Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests]]
The '''Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of central [[Africa]], covering hills, plains, and mountains of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of [[Cameroon]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Angola]], and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

This is rich forest home to large mammals such as [[western gorilla]], [[chimpanzees]], [[forest elephants]] and [[African buffalo]], as well as many small mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates. As well as chimpanzees and gorillas other primates include [[black colobus monkey]]s and [[mandrill]]s.

==Location==
The Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests cover an area of {{convert|189,700|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, extending along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast from low hills in the north to mountains further south and east. The forests cover Cameroon's southwest corner, mainland Equatorial Guinea ([[Río Muni]]) and the coastal plains of [[Gabon]]. A narrow strip extends southeast through Republic of the Congo and the eastern portion the [[Cabinda (city)|Cabinda]] enclave of Angola to just north of the [[Congo River]] in [[Bas-Congo]] province of Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests form the southernmost part of the [[Lower Guinean forests]] complex, a region of coastal moist broadleaf forests that extend north and west into southwestern Cameroon and southern Nigeria. The Atlantic Ocean lies to the west, and pockets of the [[Central African mangroves]] can be found along the [[brackish]] river mouths and estuaries along the coast. The region extends south from the [[Sanaga River]] in Cameroon down to just north of the [[River Congo]], with a number of other large rivers running through. To the east, the coastal forests transition to the [[Northwestern Congolian lowland forests]], part of the vast [[Congolian forests]] complex that covers the [[Congo Basin]]. The [[Western Congolian forest-savanna mosaic]] bounds the Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests to the southeast.

This is a tropical ecoregion receiving high rainfall throughout the year.

==Flora and fauna==
Along with the neighbouring [[Cross-Sanaga-Bioko Coastal Forests]] ecoregion the area holds about 50% of the endemic plant life of tropical West Africa. Particularly important areas for plant life include the [[Crystal Mountains National Park|Monts de Cristal]] in Gabon and the [[Mayombe]] area on the borders of the Republic of the Congo, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The area contains a number of endemic forest mammals including [[sun-tailed monkey]], [[long-footed shrew]], [[lesser Angolan epauletted fruit bat]], and [[African smoky mouse]] as well as the forest elephant and the gorillas, chimpanzees and other primates mentioned above. The forests are also rich in bird life. Endemic reptiles include the Apouh night frog (''[[Astylosternus schioetzi]]''), [[Perret's snout-burrower]], Gabon dwarf clawed frog (''[[Hymenochirus feae]]''), Ogowe River frog (''[[Phrynobatrachus ogoensis]]''), and [[Andre's clawed frog]].

==Threats and conservation==
Many of the animals here, including the primates, are endangered by hunting for meat or as prizes while elephants are poached for [[Elephant meat|meat]] and for the [[ivory trade]]. Logging is a continuing threat in Cameroon, Gabon, the Republic of Congo and particularly in Equatorial Guinea. However extensive areas of forest remain and the fauna is still especially rich in the southern parts of Equatorial Guinea and in Gabon, which has designated large areas as national parkland, including [[Loango National Park]] in this ecoregion.

==Urban areas and settlements==
This is a thinly populated region. [[South Region (Cameroon)]] is heavily forested and contains the coastal resort of [[Kribi]] and the [[Campo Ma'an National Park]]. All of mainland Equatorial Guinea ([[Río Muni]] is in this region including the port of [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]].  In Gabon, as well as logging camps, the forests are inhabited by small groups of agricultural and fishing people including traditional forest dwellers such as the [[Bakola]] and [[Bagyeli]]. Gabonese towns among the coastal forests include [[Lambaréné]], home of the [[Albert Schweitzer Hospital]],  the logging base of [[Ndjolé]], [[Fougamou]] base for visiting the [[Waka National Park]] and [[Gamba, Gabon|Gamba]], oil hub but also base for visiting Loango National Park.

'''Barkcamp State Park''' is a public recreation area located in [[Belmont County, Ohio|Belmont County]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]], near the village of [[Belmont, Ohio|Belmont]]. The {{convert|1005|acre|adj=on}} [[state park]] centers around {{convert|117|acre|adj=on}} Belmont Lake,&lt;ref name=odnr-activities/&gt; which was once considerably smaller than its present-day predecessor. The Barkcamp Creek, the namesake for the park, once ran through the area until the dam was completed in 1963, thus reducing the outflow of water. The area once housed a logging camp where logs were stripped of bark in preparation for delivery to the [[bark mill|mill]]. The [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]] began land acquisition for the park in 1955 and developed the property into a fishing and game reserve.&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt; The park houses over 150 campsites (including equestrian facilities), miles of hiking and horseback riding trails, basketball courts, boat ramps, beach, as well as other recreational sites.&lt;ref name=odnr-activities/&gt; The park ranger once lived on the site and the house still stands inside the park.

'''Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate''' ('''COSMIC''') is a program designed to provide advances in [[meteorology]], [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] research, [[climatology]], and [[space weather]] by using [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] [[satellite]]s in conjunction with [[low Earth orbit]]ing (LEO) satellites. The term "COSMIC" may refer to either the organization itself or the [[Satellite constellation|constellation of satellites]] (also known as '''[[FORMOSAT]]-3''', 福爾摩沙衛星三號, in Taiwan). The constellation is a joint U.S.-[[Taiwan]]ese project with major participants including the [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] (UCAR), the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL), the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] (AFRL) on the U.S. side and the [[National Space Organization (ROC)|National Space Organization]] (NSPO) on the Taiwanese side.

The total cost of the project is US$100 million, 80% of which is being provided by NSPO, and the remainder by various U.S. agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=COSMIC: About | work=UCAR COSMIC | url=http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/about.html | accessdate=2006-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After experiencing several delays, the launch of the COSMIC satellite constellation atop a [[Minotaur (rocket)|Minotaur]] launch vehicle from [[Vandenberg AFB]] occurred at 01:40 GMT, on April 15, 2006, despite heavy fog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Justin |last=Ray |title=Launch Coverage for Minotaur Rocket' COSMIC Mission |date=2006-04-14 |publisher=Spaceflight Now |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/sfn_minotaur_cosmic_cntdwn.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415195024/http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/sfn_minotaur_cosmic_cntdwn.html |archivedate=2006-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellites, which orbit at an altitude of 500 miles, required over a year to move into the correct positions to provide full global coverage.

== Instruments ==
[[Image:COSMIC-FORMOSAT-3.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Components of a FORMOSAT-3 / COSMIC satellite]]
The COSMIC satellites are equipped with three primary forms of instrumentation for [[remote sensing]], including:
*[[GPS Radio Occultation]] Experiment
*[[Tri-band beacon]] (TBB)
*[[Tiny Ionospheric Photometer]] (TIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher = UCAR | date = 2006-04-12 | title = New Satellite System Will Use GPS Signals To Track Hurricanes, Climate Change, and Space Weather| url = http://www.ucar.edu/news/releases/2006/cosmic.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Clear}}

==Deployment==
All 6 [[Miniaturized satellites#Microsatellite|microsatellites]] were launched on a single launch vehicle and deployed into a single [[parking orbit]] after launch. The spacecraft were then deployed into separate [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]s through the use of [[precession]] due to the [[oblateness]] of the Earth and raised to a final orbital altitude over the course of several months. Scientific data were collected during the deployment process, along with experimental validation and calibration.

== Status ==
[[File:Model of FORMOSAT-3 in NSPO, Taiwan.JPG|thumb|200px|Model of FORMOSAT-3.]]
Currently only four of the microsatellites remain fully functional.  The FM2's power system lost 50% of its output in February 2007, while FM3's solar panel also malfunctioned since August 2007. As a result, both satellites are operating in a degraded state, capable of returning data only during specific  solar angles.  The FM6 went out of control in September 2007, but control was restored by November 16 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/launch/status.html COSMIC Current Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704062725/http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/launch/status.html |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/] COSMIC Homepage&lt;/ref&gt;
FM3 had severe power problem since July 6, 2010. It is declared not functional since then. FM4, FM5, and FM6 have had battery aging problem.&lt;ref&gt;C.-J. Fong, D. Whiteley, E. Yang, K. Cook, V.

'''Donald Culross Peattie''' (June 21, 1898 – November 16, 1964) was an American [[botanist]], [[natural history|naturalist]] and author. He was described by [[Joseph Wood Krutch]] as "perhaps the most widely read of all contemporary American nature writers" during his heyday. His brother, Roderick Peattie (1891–1955), was a geographer and a noted author in his own right. Some have said that Peattie’s views on race may be considered regressive, but that expressions of these views are "mercifully brief and hardly malicious".&lt;ref&gt;http://naturalhistorynetwork.org/journal/articles/8-donald-culross-peatties-an-almanac-for-moderns/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Peattie was born in Chicago to the journalist Robert Peattie and the novelist [[Elia W. Peattie]]. He studied French poetry for two years at the [[University of Chicago]] and then transferred to – and graduated (1922) from — [[Harvard University]], where he studied with the noted botanist [[Merritt Lyndon Fernald]]. After field work in the Southern and Mid-West United States, he worked as a botanist for the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (1922–1924). He was then nature columnist for the ''[[Washington Star]]'' from 1924 to 1935. At some point in the late 1920s Peattie and his wife, with their four-year-old daughter and baby son, moved to Paris to "launch the frail bark of our careers". At two days in Paris the daughter died "of a malady unsuspected and always fatal". In a "search for sunlight" they re-settled in Vence in the south. Another son was born there.

==Later life==
Peattie was an advocate for protecting the Indiana Dunes.  He served on the [[Save the Dunes]] Council in the late 1950s, helping to bring Illinois' Senator [[Paul Douglas]] into the fight to protect the Indiana Dunes from industrial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kauffman |first=P.W. |date=2006 |title=National Parks and the Woman's Voice |url=https://www.amazon.com/National-Parks-Womans-Voice-History/dp/0826339948/ref=sr_1_1/167-3771344-8444827?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1474723039&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9780826339942 |location=Albuquerque, New Mexico |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |page=202 |isbn=9780826339942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature Work==
Peattie's [[nature writing]]s are distinguished by a poetic and philosophical cast of mind and are scientifically scrupulous. His best known works are the two books (out of a planned trilogy) on North American trees, ''A Natural History of Trees of Eastern and Central North America'' (1950) and ''A Natural History of Western Trees'' (1953), with woodcut illustrations by [[Paul Landacre]]. Peattie also produced children's and [[travel books]], altogether totaling almost forty volumes.  He also published the classic, botanical treatment on the ''Flora of the Indiana Dunes'' (1930).

An example of Peattie's views that can be construed as racist is the following, from "An Almanac for Moderns": "Every species of ant has its racial characteristics. This one seems to me to be the negro of ants, and not alone from the circumstance that he is all black, but because he is the commonest victim of slavery, and seems especially susceptible to a submissive estate. He is easily impressed by the superior organization or the menacing tactics of his raiders and drivers, and, as I know him, he is relatively lazy or at least disorganized, random, feckless and witless when free in the bush, while for his masters he will work faithfully."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peattie |first=Donald C. |date=2013 |title=An Almanac for Moderns |url=http://tupress.org/books/an-almanac-for-moderns |location=San Antonio, Texas |publisher=Trinity University Press |page=114 |isbn=9781595341563 |accessdate=July 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there's a strain of at least mild anti racism often discernible in Peattie's commentary.  For example, in his discussion of Linnaeus, the Swedish founding father of taxonomy, Peattie describes, in 1936, how Linnaeus grew up in a small, provincial town far from the scientific capitals of Europe:  "To the astonishment of all the wise men, he (Linnaeus) was not a product of Wittenberg, or the parks of Versailles or even of English country life, that nurse of so much delicate feeling for natural beauty.  But genius so seldom grows where the highly born and the members of the eugenical societies tell us to expect it!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peattie |first=Donald C. |date=1936 |title=Green Laurels: The Lives and Achievements of the Great Naturalists.  |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is a slap against the [[American Eugenics Society]], a national group formed in 1921, which was prominent in the 1930s, promoting "racial betterment."  During that time, the group consisted of "mostly prominent and wealthy members who more often than not were non-scientists." &lt;ref&gt;library.missouri.edu/exhibits/eugenics/aes.htm&lt;/ref&gt;)  

Furthermore, according to Peattie's grandson, David Peattie, "In the period following the bombing of Pearl Harbor... [Donald Culross Peattie] spoke out eloquently against the internment of Japanese Americans, and wrote letters to the editor in their defense" &lt;ref&gt;http://tupress.org/blog/david-peattie-on-his-grandfather-donald-culross-peattie&lt;/ref&gt;. That was after he witnessed a Japanese gardener, who had been hired by the owner of a house he was renting in California, interred in the camps.

It declared bankruptcy in May 2016.&lt;ref name="bankruptcy2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ristović|first1=M.|title=EI Niš: Gigant ide u prošlost|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/srbija.73.html:603362-EI-Nis-Gigant-ide-u-proslost|accessdate=5 February 2018|work=novosti.rs|date=3 May 2016|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It originated in 1948 from the foundation of the Institute for the Production of Radio Sets and Roentgen Machines, "RR Niš." In the 1970s and 1980s it was one of the greatest [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] companies employing over 10 thousand people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ei Niš odlazi u stečaj|url=http://www.capital.ba/ei-nis-odlazi-u-stecaj/|website=capital.ba|accessdate=20 June 2014|language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 1990s most of the company business collapsed, due to lack of investing in research and sanctions the country was facing.

During the 2000s, the company manufactured acoustic equipment, electronic tubes including cathode-ray tubes, printed plates, electronic machine elements, [[hydraulics]], [[pneumatics]], appliances, air-conditioners, medical equipment, roentgen machines, TV sets, radio receivers, and semiconductors. It was  one of the few remaining makers of electronic [[vacuum tube]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8191">[[File:Plum rain in Shinjuku, Tokyo.jpg|thumb|Plum rain 梅雨 falling on two clear umbrellas, looking up toward the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, in June 2009.]]

The '''East Asian rainy season''', commonly called the '''plum rain''' ({{CJKV|c=梅雨|p=méiyǔ|j=梅雨|r=tsuyu/baiu|k=장마|rr=jangma}}; {{lang-ru|затяжные}}, {{transl|ru|''zatyazhnie''}}), is caused by [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] along a persistent [[stationary front]] known as the [[Mei-Yu front]] for nearly two months during the late [[spring (season)|spring]] and early [[summer]] between eastern [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]].  The [[wet season]] ends during the summer when the [[subtropical ridge]] becomes strong enough to push this front north of the region.

==Formation==
An east-west zone of disturbed weather during spring along this front stretches from the east China coast, initially across Taiwan and Okinawa, later, when it has shifted to the north, eastward into the southern peninsula of South Korea and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npmoc.navy.mil/jtwc/atcr/1997atcr/Appendix_a&amp;b/APP-A.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427235834/http://www.npmoc.navy.mil/jtwc/atcr/1997atcr/Appendix_a%26b/APP-A.htm |date=2006-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rainy season usually lasts from May to June in Taiwan and Okinawa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happytellus.com/okinawa/japan|title=Okinawa Travel Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; from June to July (approximately 50&amp;nbsp;days) in Russian [[Primorsky Krai]], Japan and Korea and from July to August in Eastern China (especially the [[Yangtze River|Chang Jiang]] and [[Huai River]] regions).

The weather front forms when the moist air over the Pacific meets the cooler continental [[air mass]]. The front and the formation of [[extratropical cyclone|frontal depressions]] along it brings precipitation to Primorsky Krai, Japan, Korea, eastern China, and Taiwan. As the front moves back and forth depending on the strength of cool and warm air masses, there is often prolonged precipitation and sometimes flooding in eastern [[China]]. However, in the years that it does not rain as much as usual, a drought might result. The rainy season ends when the warm air mass associated with the subtropical ridge is strong enough to push the front north and away.

==Effects==
The high [[humidity]] in the air during this season encourages the formation of [[mold]] and [[Decomposition|rot]] not only on food but on fabrics as well.
Environmentally, heavy rains encourage [[mudslides]] and flooding in all areas affected. The most rain in a one-hour period as recorded in Japan was in [[Nagasaki]] in 1982 with 153&amp;nbsp;mm. The highest overall recorded rainfall during the rainy season in Japan was in 2003, when [[Miyazaki Prefecture]] recorded rains of 8670&amp;nbsp;mm.

===Japan===
In Japan, the rainy season lasts from early June to mid-July for most of the country (on the main island of [[Honshu|Honshū]] and the islands of [[Kyushu|Kyūshū]] and [[Shikoku]]), approximately June 7 to July 20 for the main [[Kansai region|Kansai]] and [[Kantō region|Kantō]] regions.&lt;ref name="jg"&gt;[http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2277.html Rainy Season (Tsuyu)], japan-guide.com&lt;/ref&gt; It comes a month earlier to Okinawa in the south (early May through mid-June), but [[Hokkaido|Hokkaidō]] in the north is largely unaffected. The season is occasionally called {{nihongo||五月雨|Samidare|literally "May Rain (in [[Lunisolar calendar|Japanese traditional calendar]])"; corresponds roughly to June in modern calendar}} on account of this timing. The [[enka]] artist Eiichi Ōtaki produced a popular song by this name, and a WW2 [[Japanese destroyer Samidare (1935)|Japanese naval ship]] was also given this name.

The rains in the middle of November - early December are sometimes called the ''Sazanka Tsuyu'', literally "rainy season of the [[Camellia sasanqua|Camellia]]" on account of the timing with the blossoming of the seasonal flower.

This period is generally avoided for tourism, but some sights are considered particularly atmospheric in the rain and fog, particularly mountain forests, notably [[Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range]] (including [[Mount Kōya]]).&lt;ref name="jg" /&gt; Vegetation, especially moss, is also rather lush at this time, and hence sights known for their moss, such as [[Saihō-ji (Kyoto)|Saihō-ji]] (the moss temple) are also popular at this time of year.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Korea===
The rainy season is between June and mid-July. It is caused by hot and humid high pressure forming in the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] due to the North Pacific anticyclone combining with Asiatic continental high pressure. When the two meteorological events meet they form a long ''jangmajeonseon'' ([[Hanja]]: 장마前線). Beginning in late-May, the North Pacific high pressure forces the weaker continental anticyclone south of the island of [[Okinawa]]. This fall to the south then reverses and gradually strengthens as it moves northwards back towards the Korean peninsula. On landfall, heavy monsoon rains lead to torrential downpours and flooding. By August the system has weakened as the southern systems retreat towards the Filipino archipelago.

By early autumn, the North Pacific high pressure system is pushed away as Asiatic continental cold high pressure moves southwards. This produces inclement weather although not on the scale of the summer monsoons. Korea can, however, be struck by typhoons during this period.

== Timing ==
In some years, the rainy season's actual beginning and end are under debate. For example, in 2005, the subtropical ridge moved quickly northward in late June/early July. The weather front skipped the [[Yangtze River|Chang Jiang]] region and there was no rainy season there. Then, the ridge retreated southward and there was significant rainfall in the region. This gave rise to the question of whether this was the summer-type rainfall pattern that is common after the first rainy season or the second rainy season. Some [[meteorologist]]s even argued that the rainy period in late June was not a true rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news3.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2005-07/14/content_3218430.htm|script-title=zh:入梅不像梅出梅梅更浓 梅雨"变味"真假难辨|language=Chinese|publisher=Xinhuanet|date=2005-07-14|accessdate=2008-05-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718132313/http://news3.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2005-07/14/content_3218430.htm|archivedate=2011-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2005-07-09/11046391887s.shtml|script-title=zh:倒黄梅?二度梅? 有关专家认为再下就要变成梅雨|language=Chinese|publisher=Sina|date=2005-07-09|accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2005-07-08/07256380930s.shtml|script-title=zh:是"倒黄梅"还是"二度梅"?接连阴雨让专家直挠头|language=Chinese|publisher=Sina|date=2005-07-08|accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnhyc.com.cn:81/servlet/News?Node=13606|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311002034/http://www.cnhyc.com.cn:81/servlet/News?Node=13606|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-03-11|script-title=zh:上海是否出现了"倒黄梅"？为啥视而不见|language=Chinese|publisher=CNHYC|date=2005-07-17|accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xhby.net/xhby/content/2005-07/12/content_858639.htm|script-title=zh:是倒黄梅还是二度梅？|language=Chinese|publisher=新华报业网|date=2005-07-12|accessdate=2008-05-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525131240/http://www.xhby.net/xhby/content/2005-07/12/content_858639.htm|archivedate=2008-05-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Latimer Beach Jr.''' (April 20, 1918 – December 1, 2002), [[List of military figures by nickname#N|nickname]]d "Ned", was a highly decorated [[United States Navy]] [[submarine]] officer and best-selling author.&lt;ref name=BeachImage&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-05-06

 |title=Eye on the Fleet Photo Gallery: Capt. Edward L. "Ned" Beach Jr.
 |work=Navy NewsStand
 |date=December 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], he participated in the [[Battle of Midway]] and 12 combat patrols, earning 10 decorations for gallantry, including the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].  After the war, he served as the naval aide to the [[President of the United States]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and commanded the first submerged [[circumnavigation]].

Beach's best-selling novel, ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep]]'', was made into the [[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|1958 movie]] by the same name. The son of Captain [[Edward L. Beach Sr.]] and Alice Fouché Beach, Beach Jr., was born in [[New York City]] and raised in [[Palo Alto, California]].

==Naval career==
Beach was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1935 by Senator [[Hiram Johnson]] of [[California]]. Beach served as a regimental commander in his first class year. Beach was named as the [[midshipman]] who had done the most to promote naval spirit and loyalty in his regiment when he graduated second out of 576 men in his class in 1939.&lt;ref name=Current_Bio_p21&gt;[[Current Biography|''Current Biography'' (1960)]], p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach, ''Salt and Steel'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Beach was initially assigned to the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Chester|CA-27|6}}, before joining the newly recommissioned [[destroyer]] {{USS|Lea|DD-118|6}}, which participated in the neutrality patrol in the Atlantic, the escort of the German [[passenger liner]] {{SS|Columbus|1924|2}}, the initial [[History of Iceland#World War II and independence from Denmark|American occupation]] of [[Iceland]], and convoy duty in the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name=Current_Bio_p21/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach, ''Salt and Steel'', pp. 38–58&lt;/ref&gt;

Beach was detached from ''Lea'' in September 1941 to undergo accelerated training at the Submarine Training School at the [[Naval Submarine Base New London|New London Submarine Base]] in [[Connecticut]]. He completed training, graduating first in his class, in December 1941 shortly after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=Current_Bio_p21/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach, ''Salt and Steel'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
During World War II Beach served aboard the [[submarine]]s {{USS|Trigger|SS-237|6}} and {{USS|Tirante|SS-420|6}}, and took command of {{USS|Piper|SS-409|6}} just as the [[Pacific War]] was ending.

[[File:Cmdr Beach WW2.JPG|thumb|right|Beach in 1945]]   After graduating from Submarine School, Beach was assigned to USS ''Trigger'' (SS-237), which was commissioned on 30 January 1942.   Aboard ''Trigger'' Beach held several shipboard positions, including communications officer, engineering officer, navigator, co-approach officer, and executive officer.  While aboard ''Trigger'', he participated in the [[Battle of Midway]] and served on 10 war patrols.  ''Trigger'' was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] and the [[Navy Unit Citation]] during Beach's time aboard her.

Beach was assigned to the new commissioned USS ''Tirante'' (SS-420) late in 1944.  He served as executive officer under Lieutenant Commander [[George L. Street]], who was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for a making a daring attack in a heavily defended Japanese harbor during ''Tirante''{{'}}s first war patrol from 3 March to 26 April 1945.  Beach received the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] for heroism during the same patrol and ''Tirante'' received the Presidential Unit Citation.

Beach assumed command of USS ''Piper'' (SS-409) at Pearl Harbor on 25 June 1945.  ''Piper'' departed on her third war patrol on 19 July and entered the [[Sea of Japan]] on 13 August.  The war ended on 14 August and ''Piper'' was in Japanese waters when the formal surrender was signed on 2 September and started her return to Pearl Harbor the next day.

During World War II, Beach earned 10 decorations for gallantry, including the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] and three unit citations, and participated in 12 war patrols that damaged or sank 45 enemy vessels.&lt;ref name=Current_Bio_p21/&gt;

===Cold War===
In December 1945, Beach reported to the [[Department of the Navy]] to serve as the personal aide to [[Vice Admiral#United States|Vice Admiral]] [[Louis E. Denfeld]], the chief of the [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]].  In March 1947, he was attached to the Atomic Defense Section (OPNAV 36) under [[Rear Admiral#United States|Rear Admiral]] [[William Sterling Parsons|William S. Parsons]].&lt;ref name=Current_Bio_p22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach, ''Salt and Steel'', pp. 168–185&lt;/ref&gt;

===USS ''Amberjack''===
In May 1948, he was given command of {{USS|Amberjack|SS-522|6}}, a [[GUPPY II#GUPPY II program|GUPPY II]] modified submarine. ''Amberjack'' gained the nickname "Anglejack" because of its pioneering use of steep diving and surfacing angles, which was immortalized in the January 1950 edition of the [[National Geographic (magazine)|''National Geographic'' magazine]].&lt;ref name=Current_Bio_p22&gt;[[Current Biography|''Current Biography'' (1960)]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach, ''Salt and Steel'', p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;  During war games, ''Amberjack'' photographed the opposing task force's flagship through its periscope and sent the admiral a copy inscribed with "Regards from Ned Beach and the Amberjack.".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;

[[File:Cmdr Edward L Beach.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Beach while a naval aide]]

===Joint Chiefs of Staff===
His tour as skipper of ''Amberjack'' was abbreviated as he was called to Washington to serve as Naval Aide to General [[Omar Bradley]], USA, the first [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], in August 1949. In that post, Beach witnessed first hand the events surrounding the [[Revolt of the Admirals]].&lt;ref name=Current_Bio_p21/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach, ''Salt and Steel'', pp. 201–219 (see photo section)&lt;/ref&gt;

===USS ''Trigger''===
Upon completing his tour of duty as Bradley's aide in March 1951, Beach was named prospective commanding officer of the new {{USS|Trigger|SS-564|3}}, then under construction. Upon commissioning of ''Trigger II'', which was named for {{USS|Trigger|SS-237|3}} lost during World War II, he became commanding officer of the second submarine to be completed in the new {{sclass-|Tang|submarine|1}} after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ss564.org/P-Plank-Owners-2.htm Plank Owners page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105153902/http://www.ss564.org/P-Plank-Owners-2.htm |date=2007-01-05 }} @ USS ''Trigger'' (SS-564) Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;

===The White House===
From 1953 to 1957, Beach was Naval Aide to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;  As Naval Aide Beach was responsible for the management of [[Camp David]], the [[White House]] Mess, and for the presidential [[yacht]] {{USS|Williamsburg|AGC-369|6}}. Because Eisenhower had made a campaign promise to get rid of the presidential yacht, neither the efforts of Beach nor those of Mrs. Eisenhower were successful in dissuading him from that course of action. The elimination of ''Williamsburg'' proved to be a bureaucratic hassle for Beach and the Navy Department since ''Williamsburg'' was the funnel for all budgets and personnel for Camp David and the White House Mess. While working the White House, Beach volunteered to be the coordinator on the White House staff for all plans to protect the President in case of nuclear attack. Since the Secret Service in 1953 did not deem helicopter travel as safe, evacuating the President on short notice was planned by Beach via the Potomac River, several PT (patrol torpedo) boats and a high speed race down river to meet up with a waiting Navy ship.&lt;ref&gt;Finch, ''Beneath the Waves: The Life and Navy of Capt. Edward L. Beach Jr.,'' pp. 65–70.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was Beach who spearheaded the effort to get [[First Lady]] [[Mamie Eisenhower]] to christen {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, the world's first [[nuclear-powered submarine]], in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Beach, ''Salt and Steel'', pp. 229–237&lt;/ref&gt;

Beach was advanced to the rank of [[Captain (U.S. Navy)|captain]] on October 1, 1956.&lt;ref name=Current_Bio_p22/&gt;

===USS ''Salamonie''===
Beach left the White House in January 1957, and assumed command of {{USS|Salamonie|AO-26|6}}, a {{sclass-|Cimarron|oiler (1939)|0}} [[fleet replenishment oiler]], on March 15.  He completed a deployment to the [[United States Sixth Fleet|U.S. Sixth Fleet]], operating in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], in December 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salamonie.homestead.com/Commanders.html List of Commanders] @ USS ''Salamonie'' (AO-26) Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach, ''Salt and Steel'', pp. 243–261&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Captain Edward Beach USS Triton 17 FEB 1960.jpg|thumb|Beach making an announcement to the crew of ''Triton'' on 17 February 1960]] 
[[File:Edward L. Beach, Jr.jpg|thumb|right|Beach traces the route of the first undersea circumnavigation by ''Triton'' in 1960]]

===USS ''Triton''===
In January 1958, he attended the Navy's training program for atomic reactors in order to qualify for his next command, {{USS|Triton|SSRN-586|6}}, the nation's fifth nuclear-powered submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Beach, ''Salt and Steel'', pp. 261–262&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1959, Beach took command of USS ''Triton'', the only American nuclear-powered submarine to be equipped with two nuclear reactors. Departing New London on what was supposed to have been a "shake-down" cruise in February 1960, ''Triton'' began a 1960 [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth in 84 days without surfacing, covering over {{convert|41000|smi|km}}, an unprecedented feat. The route of ''Triton'' followed roughly that of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1519-1522. The scientific and military significance of the ''Triton'' voyage was overshadowed by the [[U-2 Incident]] which broke just as USS ''Triton'' was returning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Triton Follows Magellan's Wake |work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |first=Edward L. |last=Beach |authorlink= |date=November 1960 |volume=118 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For successfully completing its mission, ''Triton'' was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://garrygray.tripod.com/presidential_unit_citation.htm] Presidential Unit Citation dated May 10, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;  At a special White House ceremony, Captain Beach was presented the [[Legion of Merit]] by President Eisenhower.&lt;ref name="presidency.ucsb.edu"&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=11777&amp;st=&amp;st1= Citation] accompanying Award of Legion of Merit to Captain Edward L. Beach, USN, dated May 10, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;  Beach wrote about ''Triton''{{'}}s voyage in his book ''Around the World Submerged: The Voyage of the Triton'', published in 1962.

Following her post-shakedown availability, ''Triton'' deployed to European waters with the [[United States Second Fleet|Second Fleet]] to participate in [[NATO]] exercises against British naval forces led by the [[aircraft carrier]]s {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} and {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}} under the command of [[Rear Admiral#United Kingdom|Rear Admiral]] [[Sir Charles Madden, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Madden]].  This deployment was culminated with a port visit to [[Bremerhaven]], [[West Germany]], the first visit by a nuclear-powered ship to a European port.&lt;ref&gt;Beach, ''Salt and Steel'', pp. 263–269&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subron 8, National War College and OpNav===
After his tour in command of ''Triton'', Beach commanded [[Submarine Squadron 8|Submarine Squadron Eight]] from July 1961 to August 1962. He was next a student at the [[National War College]], where he completed a course of study in July 1963.  At the same time he earned a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[International Relations]] from [[George Washington University]].

In May 1963, [[Eugene Parks Wilkinson]] and Beach were in competition for selection to Rear Admiral, and the board selected Wilkinson with Beach's sincere congratulations.&lt;ref&gt;At the end of May 1963, Wilkinson’s name appeared on the published list of officers selected for flag rank as rear admiral. Scores of congratulatory notes poured in over the next months— from many Nautilus friends and shipmates, from Rickover, from all across the Navy, private industry, friends, and acquaintances. Word was that the selection board had considered two nuclear-qualified candidates: Dennis Wilkinson and Ned Beach. Wilkinson was selected. Beach (at that time participating in a course at the National War College) sent a very warm, gracious congratulatory letter endorsing Wilkinson’s selection, “My dear Dennis . . . delighted to see it . . . realized it was between you and me. Frankly, on that basis, there was no choice whatsoever, and if I had been on the board myself, the decision would still have been unanimous.”  Winters, Ann (2017-03-28). Underway on Nuclear Power! The Man Behind the Words: Eugene P. "Dennis" Wilkinson, Vice Admiral USN (Kindle Locations 6059-6065). The American Nuclear Society. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 1963 to December 1966, Beach served in the [[office of the Chief of Naval Operations]] (OpNav) preparing annual budget reports for Congress and preparing the [[Secretary of the Navy]] ([[Fred Korth]], [[Paul B. Fay]], and [[Paul H. Nitze]]) and the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] ([[George W. Anderson Jr.]] and [[David L. McDonald]]) for hearings before Congressional committees.

Beach retired from active duty with the rank of captain in 1966, after 27 years of service.

==Naval War College and Capitol Hill==
Beach retired from active duty in the Navy in 1966, and was appointed as the [[Stephen B. Luce]] Chair of Naval Science at the [[Naval War College]] in Newport, Rhode Island &amp;mdash; the first person to hold that position.  During his tenure he was the editor of the ''Naval War College Review''.

Subsequently, Beach served for seven years as staff director of the United States Senate Republican Policy Committee, and for one year as chief of staff for Senator [[Jeremiah Denton]] (R-Alabama).

==Author==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Lancaster Gable Run Silent.jpg|thumb|right|[[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Clark Gable]] from the [[1958 in film|1958]] film adaptation of ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep]]'']] --&gt;
After World War II, Beach wrote extensively in his spare time following in the footsteps of his father, who was also a career naval officer and author. His first book ''Submarine!''  (1952) was a compilation of accounts of several wartime patrols made by his own as well as other submarines, which [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] called "the liveliest and most authentic account of underseas combat to come out of World War II."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

In all, Beach published thirteen books, but is best known for his first novel, ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep#Novel plot|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1955), which appeared on ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' bestseller list for several months.  A [[Run Silent, Run Deep#Movie plot|movie]] of the same name, [[Run Silent, Run Deep#Differences|based loosely]] on the novel and starring [[Clark Gable]] and [[Burt Lancaster]], was released by [[United Artists]] in 1958 (Beach was unhappy with the adaptation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Edward L. "Ned" Beach, Captain, USN - 1918-2002 | url= http://www.submarinesailor.com/InMemorium/BeachNed.htm|publisher=SubmarineSailor.com| accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beach penned two sequels to ''Run Silent, Run Deep'': ''Dust on the Sea'' (1972), relating in detail a war patrol by ''Eel'' leading a [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]], and ''Cold is the Sea'' (1978), set in 1961 aboard a [[nuclear submarine]].

In addition to ''Submarine!'', Beach wrote several more books on naval history, including ''The Wreck of the Memphis'' (1966); ''United States Navy: 200 Years'' (1986), a general history of the Navy; ''Scapegoats: A Defense of Kimmel and Short at Pearl Harbor'' (1995); and ''Salt and Steel: Reflections of a Submariner'' (1999). ''Keepers of the Sea'' (1983) is a pictorial record of the modern navy with photography by [[Fred J. Maroon]]. For a number of years Beach was co-editor of ''Naval Terms Dictionary'' as that standard reference work passed through several editions. His last work, completed shortly before his death, was to prepare for publication his father's manuscript of his own distinguished service in the navy. That book, ''From Annapolis to Scapa Flow: The Autobiography of Edward L. Beach, Sr'' (2003), is Captain Beach Sr.'s personal account of the navy from the age of sail to the age of steam.

In addition to his books, Beach was a prolific author of articles and book reviews for periodicals ranging from [[Blue Book (magazine)|''Blue Book Magazine'']] to [[National Geographic Magazine|''National Geographic'']], and [[Naval History (magazine)|''Naval History'']] to [[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'']].

===Navy Cross===
[[File:Navycross.jpg|left|50px]]
''The Navy Cross is presented to Edward Latimer Beach, Lieutenant Commander, United States Navy, for gallantry and intrepidity in action as Executive Officer, Navigator and Assistant Approach Officer on board the U.S.S. TIRANTE (SS-420) on the First War Patrol of that submarine during the period March 3, 1945 to April 25, 1945, in enemy controlled waters of the East China Sea. Lieutenant Commander Beach rendered valiant service to his commanding officer in penetrating mined and shoal-obstructed shallow waters in defiance of hostile shore-based radar stations and aircraft. By his excellent judgment and keen understanding of attack problems, he aided immeasurably in sending torpedoes into targets with deadly accuracy and contributed to the sinking of three Japanese cargo ships, one large transport, a hostile tanker, three patrol frigates, and one lugger, totaling 28,000 tons of shipping vital to the enemy's ability to prosecute the war. Through his experience and sound judgment he assisted in bringing his ship safely back to port. His conduct throughout was an inspiration to his officers and men and in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/1_Citations/03_wwii-nc/nc_06wwii_navy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829000000/http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/1_Citations/03_wwii-nc/nc_06wwii_navy.html |archivedate=2006-08-29 |df= }} ''Full Text Citations For Award of The Navy Cross'' @ HomeOfHeroes.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{Portal|Biography|United States Navy|World War II}}

Author [[Tom Clancy]] summarized Beach's many accomplishments and contributions when he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ned loved the Navy as a man might love his own family. For the Navy ''was'' his family, the junior officers he trained and the enlisted men who did so much of the hand-labor in the boats. He served with distinction approaching perfection and, like his [[Edward L. Beach Sr.|father]], would then write about the things he'd seen and done...  More than once I spoke with him about the psychological aspects of combat, and every time he told me what I needed to know, always from his own rich experiences. Ned was a serious student of history -- he wrote several splendid books on this subject -- and of human nature. What he didn't know had never happened.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Clancy]]. "He Lived What He Wrote." [[Wall Street Journal|''Opinion Journal'']] (December 4, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ed Offley of ''DefenseWatch'' wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Beach once told an interviewer, "What is there about the Navy? To me, it's always been a tremendous feeling that I am part of an organization that's much bigger than I am."

The submariner was inaccurate. It is sailors like Capt. Edward L. Beach Jr. – who died on December 1 at the age of 84 – who make institutions like the Navy bigger and greater than they otherwise would be.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Offley. “In Memoriam – Capt. Edward L. Beach Jr. USN (SS)” ''DefenseWatch'' (December 4, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5005">==Background==
After [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Union]] put in place [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plan]]s in the [[East European]] countries imitating their own five-year plans in order to recover from the war.  The Soviets believed that the economic policies that helped them recover would similarly help the [[Eastern European]] counties recoup.  Countries in the [[Eastern Bloc]] were instructed to build up the industries present in the Soviet Union – regardless of whether or not they had the [[natural resource]]s to support those industries – or to concentrate on developing pre-existing industries which could benefit the Soviet Union. In the case of [[Czechoslovakia]], the state was told to concentrate on [[heavy industry]].  This concentration on heavy industry depleted the country's natural resources at an extraordinarily fast rate and produced an excessive amount of [[pollution]].

==Effects==
The [[pollution]] produced by heavy industry seriously degraded air quality.  The air contained high concentrations of [[sulfur dioxide]] because the energy production was largely based on combustion of fuel high in sulfur.  As a result, 50 percent of the forests were either dead or dying.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}  Cases of [[bronchitis]] and [[asthma]] in children almost doubled with the increase in the use of sulfur dioxide.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}  The water, too, was affected by the excessive pollution, both from industrial [[fertilizer]]s and [[oil spill]]s.  The lack of water [[waste treatment]] meant that a large portion of the water was undrinkable for the population, and some of the water was so bad that it was even unusable by the industry.  Conditions were worst in Northern [[Bohemia]], which was a part of the so-called ‘triangle of death’{{Fact|date=May 2008}} that also included South-East [[East Germany]] and South-West [[Poland]], but the effects were also felt beyond the region in which the pollution originated.  The [[Danube River]] carried much of the pollution to other areas of the state and other countries, and [[acid rain]] brought the pollution directly to the cities, where it could eat away at the buildings and statues.&lt;ref name = "adamova"&gt;Adamova, Eva. “Environmental Management in Czecho-Slovakia”. Environmental Action in Eastern Europe. Ed. Barbara Jancar-Webster. Armonk, New York: M.E. Sharpe, 1993. 42-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The government's role==
While pollution was increasing, records and information relating to pollution became increasingly inaccessible to the public.  Students who tried to make the public aware of the problems were arrested and detained by the police.&lt;ref&gt;Students Take Word of Protests to Czechoslovak Towns, Villages; Communist Authorities Try to Stop Activists from Spreading the News, The Washington Post, November 24th, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often no records were even kept on the industrial effects on the environment.  There were some people involved with [[non-governmental organizations]] that tried to correct the situation, but these groups were largely interested in acting as an adversary of the state.  Under the [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia]], the state was legally required to protect the quality of the environment as far as necessary to protect human health, but in northern Czechoslovakia, pollution reportedly shortened a person’s life by three to four years.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}  The government even acknowledged these poor living conditions by offering a bonus to people who lived in the area for more than ten years – called burial money by the people in the area.&lt;ref&gt;East Europe: Greening of the Reds, ''The Washington Post'', December 24, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government faced problems in trying to solve environmental problems because there was no central branch responsible for environmental safety and protection.  Instead, there were many different branches responsible for different aspects of the environment – one for water, one for land, one for air, etc., and these different branches often had conflicting interests.  Each branch would try to enforce its own environmental priorities without regard to the overall environmental picture.  Furthermore, these branches were in charge not only of the environmental issues in their area, but also of the economic issues, giving each branch a set of conflicting priorities, and economic needs would generally win out.  When the government imposed fines for failures to comply with pollution regulations, it would also help industry pay off the fines, leaving industry with little incentive to change policies.&lt;ref name = "adamova"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;The Scars of Pollution; Iron Curtain Rises to Reveal Dirt, Death; POISON IN THE EAST, ''The Boston Globe'', December 17, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forest-savanna mosaic''' is a transitory [[ecotone]] between the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forests]] of [[Equatorial Africa]] and the drier savannas and open woodlands to the north and south of the forest belt. The forest-savanna mosaic consists of drier forests, often [[gallery forest]], interspersed with [[savanna]]s and open [[grassland]]s.

==Ecoregions==
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] recognizes several distinct forest-savanna mosaic [[ecoregion]]s:

* The [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] is the transition between the [[Upper Guinean forests|Upper]] and [[Lower Guinean forests]] of [[West Africa]] and the [[West Sudanian savanna]]. The ecoregion extends from [[Senegal]] on the west to the [[Cameroon Highlands]] on the east. The [[Dahomey Gap]] is a region of [[Togo]] and [[Benin]] where the forest-savanna mosaic extends to the coast, separating the Upper and Lower Guinean forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0707|title=Western Africa: Stretching form Nigeria to Senegal  - Ecoregions - WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic]] lies between the [[Congolian forests]] of [[Central Africa]] and the [[East Sudanian savanna]]. It extends from the [[Cameroon Highlands]] in the west to the [[East African Rift]] in the east, encompassing portions of [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and southwestern [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0712|title=Central Africa  - Ecoregions - WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Western Congolian forest-savanna mosaic]] lies southwest of the Congolian forest belt, covering portions of southern [[Gabon]], southern [[Republic of the Congo]], western [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and northwestern [[Angola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0701|title=Angolan Miombo woodlands  - Ecoregions - WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Southern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic]] lies east of the Western Congolian forest savanna mosaic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, separating the Congolian forests to the north from the [[Miombo woodlands]] to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0718|title=Central Africa: Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola   - Ecoregions - WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Victoria Basin forest-savanna mosaic]] lies to the east and north of [[Lake Victoria]] in [[East Africa]], and is surrounded on the east and west by the montane forests of the [[East African Rift]]'s Western and Eastern arcs. The ecoregion covers much of [[Uganda]], extending into portions of eastern [[Kenya]], northwestern [[Tanzania]], and eastern [[Rwanda]].

'''Fuller's earth''' is any clay material that has the capability to decolorize oil or other liquids without chemical treatment.&lt;ref name=USGS1522&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hosterman|first=John W.|author2=Sam H. Patterson|title=Bentonite and Fuller's Earth Resources of the United States|journal=U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1522|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; Fuller's earth typically consists of palygorskite ([[attapulgite]]) or [[bentonite]].&lt;ref name=USGS1522 /&gt;

Modern uses of fuller's earth include absorbents for oil, grease, and animal waste (cat litter) and as a carrier for pesticides and fertilizers. Minor uses include filtering, clarifying, and decolorizing; active and inactive ingredient in beauty products; and as a filler in paint, plaster, adhesives, and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name=USGS1522 /&gt; It also has a number of uses in the film industry and on stage.

== Etymology ==
The English name reflects the historic use of the material for cleaning or "[[fulling]]" wool by textile workers called "fullers".&lt;ref name=USGS1522 /&gt;&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Fuller's earth | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | volume = Encyclopædia Britannica Online  | url = http://www.britannica.com/science/fullers-earth | accessdate =7 July 2015|last = Lotha|first = Gloria|date = 13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|fuller}}&lt;/ref&gt; In past centuries, [[fulling|fullers]] kneaded fuller's earth and water into [[woollen]] cloth to absorb [[lanolin]], oils, and other greasy impurities as part of the cloth finishing process.
  
Fuller's Earth is also known by the following other names: 
* "Bleaching clay",&lt;ref name=Nutting&gt;{{cite book|last=Nutting|first=P. G.|title=The Bleaching Clays|year=1933|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably because fulling whitened the cloth. 
* "Whitening clay", particularly when used to treat facial pigmentation, such as [[melasma]].
* "Multani mitti", or "mud from Multan" (city in Pakistan), in ancient India it was used in cosmetics.

== Occurrence and composition ==
Fuller's earth consists primarily of [[clay minerals|hydrous aluminum silicates]] (clay minerals) of varying composition.&lt;ref name=USGS1522 /&gt; Common components are [[montmorillonite]], [[kaolinite]] and [[attapulgite]]. Small amounts of other minerals may be present in fuller's earth deposits, including [[calcite]], [[dolomite]], and [[quartz]]. In some localities fuller's earth refers to [[Bentonite#Calcium bentonite|calcium bentonite]], which is altered volcanic ash composed mostly of montmorillonite.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Cornelis (2002). ''Mineral Science''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the United States was the largest producer of fuller's earth with an almost 70% world share followed at a distance by Japan and Mexico. In the United States fuller's earth is typically derived from deposits of volcanic ash of [[Cretaceous]] age and younger (glacial clays do not form fuller's earth).&lt;ref name=USGS1522 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nutting /&gt; Fuller's earth deposits have been mined in 24 states.&lt;ref name=USGS1522 /&gt; The first discovery of fuller’s earth in the United States was near [[Quincy, Florida]], in 1893; previously it was imported from England. In 1939 mines near Quincy produced half the U.S. production.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|pages=442–443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, fuller's earth occurs mainly in England. It has been mined in the [[Lower Greensand Group]] and the [[Vale of White Horse]], [[Oxfordshire]]. The [[Combe Hay]] Mine was a fuller's earth mine operating to the south of [[Bath, Somerset]] until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.minersoc.org/pages/Archive-CM/Volume_21/21-3-293.pdf|title=Clay Mineralogy and Plasticity of the Fuller's Earth Formation Bath, UK|author1=Hawkins, A.

Stationery Office|title=Mineral statistics of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland |year=1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these sites had been used since Roman times, [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]] developed new methods for the identification of deposits of fuller's earth to the south of Bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macmillen|first=Neil|title=A history of the Fuller's Earth mining industry around Bath|year=2009|publisher=Lightmoor Press|location=Lydney|isbn=978-1-899889-32-7|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other English sources include a mine near [[Redhill, Surrey]] (worked until 2000), and [[Woburn, Bedfordshire]], where production ceased in 2004.&lt;ref name=BGS&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=British Geological Survey |title=Mineral Fact Sheet: Fuller's Earth |url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/downloads/start.cfm?id=1358 |accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hills, cliffs, and slopes that contain fuller's earth can be unstable, since this material can be [[thixotropy|thixotropic]] when saturated by heavy rainfall.

== Historical significance ==
Fulling is an important step in the production of woolen garments, and can be traced back to ancient times. Cuneiform texts from [[Mesopotamia]] mention a raw material, {{lang|akk-Latn|im-bab-bár}} ({{lang-akk|𒅎𒌓}}, {{lang|akk-Latn|gaṣṣu}}: ‘gypsum, plaster’), literally “white earth”, which was delivered to fullers for the finishing of cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soriga |first1=Elena |title=A Diachronic View on Fulling Technology in the Mediterranean and the Ancient Near East: Tools, Raw Materials and Natural Resources for the Finishing of Textiles |journal=Textile Terminologies from the Orient to the Mediterranean and Europe, 1000 BC to 1000 AD |date=2017 |volume=4 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/texterm/4 |accessdate=23 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several Biblical references to fulling (2 Kings 18:17; Isaiah 7:3 and 36:2; Malachi 3:2; Mark 9:3), but the materials used to whiten the fabric are not specified. [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions several types of fuller’s earth ({{lang|la|creta fullonia}} in Latin) from a variety of locations, each with different properties and therefore different uses.

The first references to fulling mills are from [[Persia]], and by the time of the [[Crusades]] in the late eleventh century, fulling mills were active throughout the medieval world.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Woods (2005), "How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization", ''How the Monks Saved Civilization'' '''33''' &lt;/ref&gt; 

Called 'Multani Mitti' ('mud from [[Multan]]') in modern-day India and Pakistan, the use of Fuller's earth across the Indian subcontinent dates back to at least 1879&lt;ref name="Bhola"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bhola |first1=K. L. |title=Fuller's Earth in India |journal=Transactions of the Indian Ceramic Society |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=104–124 |doi=10.1080/0371750x.1946.10877805 |year=1946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. While its household use and transportation by local carts in the [[Sindh]] region predates the 1800s, export by rail was first recorded in 1929 in [[British India]].

== Uses ==

In addition to its original use in the [[fulling]] of raw fibers, fuller's earth is now utilized in a number of industries.&lt;ref name=USGS1522 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nutting/&gt; Most important applications make use of the minerals' natural absorbent properties in products sold as absorbents or [[Filtration|filters]].

* Treatment for [[poisoning]]. Even given the risk of salmonella, the clay content of soil could save the life of a person exposed to [[paraquat]], for example, as paraquat is intended to break down in soil.&lt;ref&gt;Revkin, A. C. "Paraquat: A potent weed killer is killing people". Science Digest. 1983, 91 (6): 36–38. 4. &lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Decontamination]]: Fuller's earth is used by military and civil emergency service personnel to decontaminate the clothing and equipment of servicemen and CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear) responders who have been contaminated with [[Chemical weapon|chemical agents]].&lt;ref&gt;''Survive to Fight'', British Army CBRN Publication, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Cleaning agent]]: In the Indian subcontinent, it has been used for centuries to clean marble.{{fact|date=January 2018}} As a good absorbent, it removes dust, dirt, impurities and stains from the surface and replenishes the shine of the marble.

* [[Film industry]]: Fuller's earth has been used extensively for many years in motion pictures for a variety of applications. In the area of [[special effect]]s, it is used in [[pyrotechnics]] explosions and dust clouds, because it spreads farther and higher than most natural soils, resulting in a blast that looks larger.  It is also safer than naturally occurring soil, should the blast spray hit actors. The material was used in the tornado sequence in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' as the artificial twister plowed its way toward the farmhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=PuYMBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT290&amp;lpg=PT290&amp;dq=wizard+of+oz+fuller's+earth#v=onepage&amp;q=wizard%20of%20oz%20fuller's%20earth&amp;f=false | title=The Wizard of Oz FAQ: All That's Left to Know About Life, According to Oz| isbn=9781480397194| last1=Hogan| first1=David J.| date=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller's earth is also widely used by the [[Cosmetics|make-up]], [[Theatrical property|props]], [[wardrobe]], and  [[set dresser]] departments, because it is considered a "clean" dirt, safer to use around people, and it cleans up easily.  However, health concerns in this regard have been debated.&lt;ref&gt;Pickut, Walt (16 July 2015) [http://www.livestrong.com/article/188651-fullers-earth-health-effects/ Fuller's Earth Health Effects]. livestrong.com&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller's earth is available in small quantities by make-up suppliers for use in making the face and body appear dirty. It is used by props technicians to make furniture look dusty. Wardrobe dressers use a small, loose-mesh cloth bag filled with fuller's earth to apply it to clothing to make it appear dusty. Set dressers use fuller's earth to change paved streets into dirt roads, to create dust trailing from a moving vehicle over a dirt road, or to indicate a vehicle trail over untraveled ground.

According to the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], a nation's '''internal waters''' include waters on the landward side of the [[baseline (sea)|baseline]] of a nation's [[territorial waters]], except in [[archipelagic state]]s.&lt;ref name=UNCLOS_PartII&gt;[https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, Part II, Article 8 ''Internal waters'']&lt;/ref&gt; It includes waterways such as rivers and canals, and sometimes the water within small [[bay]]s. 

In inland waters, sovereignty of the state is equal to that which it exercises on the mainland. The coastal state is free to make laws relating to its internal waters, regulate any use, and use any resource. In the absence of agreements to the contrary, foreign vessels have no right of passage within internal waters, and this lack of right to [[innocent passage]] is the key difference between internal waters and territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, Part II, Article 2&lt;/ref&gt; The "archipelagic waters" within the outermost islands of archipelagic states are treated as internal waters with the exception that innocent passage must be allowed, although the archipelagic state may designate certain sea lanes in these waters.

When a foreign vessel is authorized to enter inland waters, it is subject to the laws of the coastal State, with one exception: the crew of the ship is subject to the law of the [[flag State]]. This extends to labor conditions as well as to crimes committed on board the ship, even if docked at a port. Offences committed in the harbor and the crimes committed there by the crew of a foreign vessel always fall in the jurisdiction of the coastal State. The coastal State can intervene in ship affairs when the master of the vessel requires intervention of the local authorities, when there is danger to the peace and security of the coastal State, or to enforce customs rules.&lt;ref name=UNCLOS_PartII/&gt;

==Disputes==
The claim by one state of a waterway as internal waters has led to disputes with other states. For example, [[Canada]] claims a section of the [[Northwest Passage]] as part of its internal waters, fully under Canadian jurisdiction,&lt;ref name="UNCLOSIV"&gt;

The [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]], which was formed in 1994, has the power to settle maritime disputes between party states, although in practice, these resolutions depend on the willingness of these states to adhere to the rulings.

[[File:DBP 1983 1187 Geodäsie und Geophysik.jpg|thumb|upright|German stamp about the IUGG General Assembly in 1983, Hamburg]]

The '''International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics''' ('''IUGG'''; {{lang-fr|Union géodésique et géophysique internationale}}, '''UGGI''') is an [[international non-governmental organisation]] dedicated to the scientific study of the [[Earth]] and its [[space environment]] using [[Geophysics|geophysical]] and [[Geodesy|geodetic]] techniques.

The IUGG was established in Brussels, Belgium in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyons|first1=Henry G.|title=The Brussels Meeting of the International Research Council|journal=Nature|year=1919|volume=103|issue=2598|pages=464–466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cochrane&gt;{{cite book|last=Cochrane|first=Rexmond C.|title=The National Academy of Sciences: The First Hundred Years, 1863-1963|year=1978|publisher=National Academies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Good|first1=Gregory A.|title=The Assembly of Geophysics: Scientific Disciplines as Frameworks of Consensus|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|year=2000|volume=31|issue=3|pages=259–292|doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(00)00018-6|ref=harv|bibcode=2000SHPMP..31..259G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ismail-Zadeh|first1=Alik|title=Geoscience international: the role of scientific unions|journal=Hist. Geo Space Sci.|year=2016|volume=7|pages=103-123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some areas within its scope are environmental preservation, reduction of the effects of natural hazards, and [[mineral]] resources.

== Objectives == 
IUGG's objectives are the promotion and coordination of studies related to Earth's physical, chemical and mathematical representation.  This includes geometrical shape, internal structure, gravity and magnetic fields, [[seismicity]], [[volcanism]], [[hydrologic cycle]], glaciers, oceans, atmosphere, [[ionosphere]], and [[magnetosphere]] of Earth. It also includes solar, lunar and planetary studies.&lt;ref&gt;Burchfiel, B. C. (1987) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz0rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA32 ''International Role of U.S. Geoscience''] US National Academies page 32&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structures ==
The IUGG consists of eight semi-autonomous associations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Associations of the IUGG|url=http://www.iugg.org/associations/|publisher=International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[International Association of Cryospheric Sciences]] (IACS)
*[[International Association of Geodesy]] (IAG)
*[[International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy]] (IAGA)
*[[International Association of Hydrological Sciences]] (IAHS)
*International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS)
*International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO)
*International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI)
*[[International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior]] (IAVCEI)

It has also established six commissions to promote interdisciplinary problems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Union Commissions|url=http://www.iugg.org/about/commissions/|publisher=International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Climatic and Environmental Changes (CCEC)
*Mathematical Geophysics (CMG)
*Geophysical Risk and Sustainability (GRC)
*Study of the Earth's Deep Interior (SEDI)
*Data and Information (UCDI)
*Planetary Sciences (UCPS)
and the Union Working Group on History.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12098">'''Jet propulsion''' is the [[propulsion]] of an object in one direction, produced by ejecting a [[jet (fluid)|jet]] of [[fluid]] in the opposite direction. By [[Newton's third law]], the moving body is propelled in the opposite direction to the jet. [[Reaction engine]]s operating on the principle of jet propulsion include the [[jet engine]] used for [[aircraft propulsion]], the [[pump-jet]] used for [[marine propulsion]], and the [[rocket engine]] and [[plasma thruster]] used for [[spacecraft propulsion]]. Biological systems include the propulsion mechanisms of certain [[marine animal]]s such as [[cephalopod]]s, [[sea hare]]s, [[arthropod]]s, and [[fish]].

==Physics==
Jet propulsion is produced by some [[reaction engine]]s or animals when thrust is generated by a fast moving [[jet (fluid)|jet]] of [[fluid]] in accordance with [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]. It is most effective when the [[Reynolds number]] is high—that is, the object being propelled is relatively large and passing through a low-viscosity medium.&lt;ref name='Packard1972'&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = A.| title = Cephalopods and Fish: the Limits of Convergence| journal = Biological Reviews| volume = 47| issue = 2| last1 = Packard| pages = 241–307| year = 1972| doi = 10.1111/j.1469-185X.1972.tb00975.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In biology, the most efficient jets are pulsed, rather than continuous,&lt;ref name="ref_d"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sutherland | first1 = K. R. | last2 = Madin | first2 = L.

===Specific impulse===
{{main|Specific impulse}}
Specific impulse (usually abbreviated ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;) is a measure of how effectively a [[rocket engine|rocket]] uses propellant or [[jet engine]] uses fuel. By definition, it is the [[impulse (physics)|total impulse]] (or change in [[momentum]]) delivered per unit of [[propellant]] consumed&lt;ref name="QRG1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/propulsion/3-what-is-specific-impulse.html|title=What is specific impulse?|publisher=Qualitative Reasoning Group|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is [[dimensional analysis|dimensionally equivalent]] to the generated [[thrust]] divided by the propellant [[mass flow rate]] or weight flow rate.&lt;ref name="SINasa"/&gt; If [[mass]] ([[kilogram]], [[pound-mass]], or [[slug (unit)|slug]]) is used as the unit of propellant, then specific impulse has units of [[velocity]]. If weight ([[newton (unit)|newton]] or [[pound-force]]) is used instead, then specific impulse has units of time (seconds).  Multiplying flow rate by the standard gravity ([[standard gravity|''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]) converts specific impulse from the  mass basis to the weight basis.&lt;ref name="SINasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/specimp.html|title=Specific impulse|last=Benson|first=Tom|date=11 July 2008|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A propulsion system with a higher specific impulse uses the mass of the propellant more effectively in creating forward thrust and, in the case of a rocket, less propellant needed for a given [[delta-v]], per the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]].&lt;ref name="QRG1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars20130414"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutchinson|first=Lee |title=New F-1B rocket engine upgrades Apollo-era design with 1.8M lbs of thrust |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/new-f-1b-rocket-engine-upgrades-apollo-era-deisgn-with-1-8m-lbs-of-thrust/ |accessdate=15 April 2013 |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |date=14 April 2013 |quote=The measure of a rocket's fuel effectiveness is called its specific impulse (abbreviated as 'ISP'—or more properly Isp).... 'Mass specific impulse...describes the thrust-producing effectiveness of a chemical reaction and it is most easily thought of as the amount of thrust force produced by each pound (mass) of fuel and oxidizer propellant burned in a unit of time. It is kind of like a measure of miles per gallon (mpg) for rockets.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rockets, this means the engine is more effective at gaining altitude, distance, and velocity. This effectiveness is less important in jet engines that employ wings and use outside air for combustion and carry payloads that are much heavier than the propellant.

Specific impulse includes the contribution to impulse provided by external air that has been used for combustion and is exhausted with the spent propellant. Jet engines use outside air, and therefore have a much higher specific impulse than rocket engines. The specific impulse in terms of propellant mass spent has units of distance per time, which is an artificial velocity called the "effective exhaust velocity". This is higher than the ''actual'' exhaust velocity because the mass of the combustion air is not being accounted for. Actual and effective exhaust velocity are the same in rocket engines not utilizing air.

Specific impulse is inversely proportional to [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] (SFC) by the relationship ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/(''g&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''·SFC) for SFC in kg/(N·s) and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; = 3600/SFC for SFC in lb/(lbf·hr).

===Thrust===

From the definition of specific impulse thrust in SI units is:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \dot m V_e&lt;/math&gt;

where V{{sub|e}} is the effective exhaust velocity and &lt;math&gt;\dot m&lt;/math&gt; is the propellant flow rate.

==Types of reaction engine==
{{Main|Reaction engine}}
Reaction engines produce thrust by expelling solid or fluid [[reaction mass]]; jet propulsion applies only to engines which use fluid reaction mass.

===Jet engine===
{{main|Jet engine}}
A jet engine is a [[reaction engine]] which uses ambient air as the working fluid, and converts it to a hot, high-pressure gas which is expanded through one or more [[nozzle]]s. Two types of jet engine, the [[turbojet]] and [[turbofan]], employ [[axial-flow compressor|axial-flow]] or [[centrifugal compressor]]s to raise the pressure before [[combustor|combustion]], and [[turbines]] to drive the compression. [[Ramjet]]s operate only at high flight speeds because they omit the compressors and turbines, depending instead on the [[dynamic pressure]] generated by the high speed (known as ram compression). [[Pulse jet engine|Pulse jets]] also omit the compressors and turbines, but can generate static thrust and have limited maximum speed.

===Rocket engine===
{{main|Rocket engine}}
The rocket is capable of [[spaceflight|operating in the vacuum of space]], because it is dependent on the vehicle carrying its own [[oxidizer]] instead of using the oxygen in the air, or in the case of a [[nuclear rocket]], heats an inert propellant (such as liquid [[hydrogen]]) by forcing it through a [[nuclear reactor]].

===Plasma engine===
{{main|Plasma propulsion engine}}
Plasma thrusters accelerate a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] by [[electromagnetic]] means.

===Pump-jet===
{{Main|Pump-jet}}
The pump-jet, used for [[marine propulsion]], uses water as the working fluid, pressurized by a [[ducted propeller]], [[centrifugal pump]], or a combination of the two.

==Jet-propelled animals==
{{further|Aquatic locomotion#Jet Propulsion}}
Jet propulsion in [[cephalopod]]s is produced by water being exhaled through a [[Siphon (mollusc)|siphon]], which typically narrows to a small opening to produce the maximum exhalent velocity.  The water passes through the gills prior to exhalation, fulfilling the dual purpose of respiration and locomotion.&lt;ref name='Packard1972'/&gt;  Sea hares (gastropod molluscs) employ a similar means of jet propulsion, but without the sophisticated neurological machinery of cephalopods they navigate somewhat more clumsily.&lt;ref name='Packard1972'/&gt;

Some [[teleost fish]] have also developed jet propulsion, passing water through the gills to supplement fin-driven motion.&lt;ref name=Hanken1993&gt;{{cite book|title=The Skull|editor-last=Hanken|editor-first=James|publisher	=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1993|isbn=978-0-226-31573-7|pages=460|chapter=The Skull as a Locomotor Organ|last=Wake|first=M.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|201}}

In some [[dragonfly]] larvae, jet propulsion is achieved by the expulsion of water from a specialised cavity through the anus. Given the small size of the organism, a great speed is achieved.&lt;ref name='Mill2004'&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P. J.| first2 = R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10185">'''Jan''', '''Johan''' or '''Johannes van Walbeeck''' (1602, [[Amsterdam]] – after 1649) was a Dutch navigator and cartographer during a 1620s circumnavigation of the earth, an admiral of the [[Dutch West India Company]], and the first governor of the [[Netherlands Antilles]].

==Biography==
Van Walbeeck is thought to have been born in Amsterdam in 1601 or 1602 &lt;ref name = "encyc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curacao-encyclopedia.com/?node=main&amp;id=374&amp;lang= |title=Encyclopedie van de Nederlandse Antillen |language=nl  |publisher=Curacao-encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maps"&gt;{{cite web |first=M. |last=Donkersloot-de Vrij |url=

He studied at the [[University of Leiden]] before enlisting as navigator and cartographer on the ship ''De Amsterdam'' during the three-year [[circumnavigation]] of the world from 1623 to 1626 by the [[Nassau fleet]] (''Nassause vloot'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~j.pasteur/NASSAUINDEX.html |title=Nassau Index |publisher=[[Web.archive.org]] |date=2007-06-21 |accessdate=2014-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621175054/http://www.btinternet.com/~j.pasteur/NASSAUINDEX.html |archivedate=June 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; led by Admiral [[Jacques l'Hermite]] and Vice Admiral [[Gheen Huygensz Schapenham]]. It is thought that the account of this voyage published by [[Hessel Gerritsz]] shortly after the expedition's return in 1626 was written and drawn by Van Walbeeck.

In 1627, Van Walbeeck continued his mathematics and physics study in Leiden, but interrupted it again to join [[Laurens Reael]]'s diplomatic mission to Denmark at the end of the year. Upon his return, he enlisted in a fleet that sailed to the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref name = "encyc"/&gt;

[[File:AMH-8608-NA Manuscript chart of the area west of Recife.jpg|thumb|Map of [[Recife]] made by Van Walbeeck]]

In 1629, back in the Netherlands, he changed employment from the [[Dutch East India Company]] to the [[Dutch West India Company]] (WIC).  In April 1630, he arrived on the ship ''Neptunus'' in [[Pernambuco]], after [[Hendrick Cornelisz Loncq]] had taken [[Olinda]] in February and [[Recife]] in March from the Portuguese (who between 1580 and 1640 were governed by [[Habsburg Spain]], with which the Dutch Republic was at [[Eighty Years War|war]]). Van Walbeeck immediately was made a member of the ''Politieke Raad'' ("Political Council"), the highest level of government in [[Dutch Brazil#Nieuw Holland colony|Dutch Brazil]].&lt;ref name = "encyc"/&gt; Already in the same year, Loncq sent him (as "Admiral of the Brazilian coast") and [[Maarten Valck]] to establish a Dutch base on the [[Chile]]an coast from which to explore [[Terra Australis]]. However, due to the colonial conflicts between the Dutch Republic and Portugal, the expedition did not get to its destination.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, William. ''The Furthest Shore: Images of Terra Australis from the Middle Ages to Captain Cook''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1995. (pg. 97) {{ISBN|0-521-39268-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several more expeditions followed, until in 1632 Van Walbeeck was promoted to president of the Politieke Raad.

[[File:Fort Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Amsterdam (Curaçao)|Fort Amsterdam]]]]
In 1633, Van Walbeeck and the governor of Dutch Brazil, [[Dierick van Waerdenburgh]], left for the Dutch Republic to meet with the WIC council ("de heren XIX"). The WIC had lost its base in the Antilles when a  Spanish fleet had destroyed its settlement on [[Sint Maarten]] in the summer of that year. The council now planned a base in [[Curaçao]] and [[Bonaire]], [[Lesser Antilles]] under Spanish rule of [[Province of Venezuela]], both for the salt pans (large quantities of salt were needed to preserve fish), and as a strategic location off the South American mainland. The natural harbor of St Anna Bay on [[Curaçao]] was the perfect location for this. On April 6, 1634 they assigned Van Walbeeck to the task of taking it from the Spanish, who had colonized the island since the 1520s.  On 4 May 1634, he departed from Holland with four ships, carrying 180 sailors and 250 soldiers, led by the French Huguenot mercenary Pierre Le Grand &lt;!-- probably not the same person as the (even possibly fictional) pirate Pierre Le Grand --&gt; who had previously served the Dutch in Brazil.&lt;ref name = "marley"&gt;{{cite book |first=David F. |last=Marley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q1a4j2HNmjUC |title=Historic Cities of the Americas: An Illustrated Encyclopedia |publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]] |date=2005 |isbn= 1-57607-027-1 | pages= 73–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small fleet arrived at Curaçao on July 6, but through adverse currents and winds could not enter the bay. On July 29, after being joined by a fifth ship and approaching from the north west, the fleet could enter the bay and captured the island from Spain with little resistance and without loss of life on either side. Van Walbeeck wrote in his diary, as transcribed by [[Johannes de Laet]] before it was lost, that the 32 Spanish and under 500 remaining (or reintroduced) local [[Arawak]]s inhabitants just withdrew to the West end of the island after poisoning their wells and burning their villages. On August 21 the Spanish commander, [[Lope Lopez de Morla]], signed the surrender. The Dutch deported the Spaniards and most West Indians to the Venezuelan port of [[Santa Ana de Coro|Coro]], keeping about seventy-five of the latter as laborers. Thus, Van Walbeeck became the first director/governor of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. The first task was to build a fortification at the natural harbor, renamed "Schottegat" by the Dutch, which pentagonal structure [[Fort Amsterdam (Curaçao)|Fort Amsterdam]] was finished in 1635, following standard Dutch military engineering practice. During his three years as governor, the beginnings of the town of [[Willemstad]] were built next to the fort.&lt;ref name = "marley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engelfriet.net/Alie/Hans/antillen.htm |title=De geschiedenis van de Nederlandse Antillen |publisher=Engelfriet.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1638, he and Le Grand were sent to Brazil, while [[Jacob Pietersz Tolck]] took over his position as governor although van Walbeeck remained political director of Curaçao for the next several years.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, Barbara. ''A Sweet and Alien Land: The Story of Dutch New York''. New York: Viking Press, 1978. (pg. 150) {{ISBN|0-670-68628-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed in Brazil as a member of the Hoge Raad until 1642, after which he returned to Holland again to give advice on the forthcoming expedition under [[Hendrick Brouwer]] to establish a trading base in [[Chile]]. He went back to Brazil, being mentioned as elder of the Reformed Church there. In 1647 he left Brazil. Maybe he died in the Netherlands, as he lived in Amsterdam when his wife was buried there on 29 April 1649.&lt;ref name = "encyc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/archieven/archiefbank/indexen/begraafregisters_voor_1811/zoek/query.nl.pl?i1=1&amp;v1=Jo*&amp;a1=Walb*&amp;t1=van&amp;x=12&amp;z=a |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530212022/https://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/archieven/archiefbank/indexen/begraafregisters_voor_1811/zoek/query.nl.pl?i1=1&amp;v1=Jo*&amp;a1=Walb*&amp;t1=van&amp;x=12&amp;z=a |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-30 |title=Begraafregisters voor 1811 |language=nl |publisher=Stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Peter Stuyvesant]], Van Walbeeck was one of the limited number of WIC employees with a university education. The company appears to have valued him at least as highly as Stuyvesant and it has been suggested that he missed being appointed director-general of the [[New Netherlands]] merely by not being in the Netherlands at the right time.&lt;ref name = "encyc"/&gt;

The '''law of three stages''' is an idea developed by [[Auguste Comte]] in his work ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]''. It states that [[society]] as a whole, and each particular science, develops through three mentally conceived stages: (1) the [[theology|theological]] stage, (2) the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] stage, and (3) the [[positivism|positive]] stage.

==The progression of the three stages of sociology== 
(1) The Theological stage refers to explanation by personified deities. During the earlier stages, people believe that all the phenomena of nature are the creation of the divine or supernatural. Men and children failed to discover the natural causes of various phenomena and hence attributed them to a supernatural or divine power.&lt;ref name ="majorcontrib"&gt;{{cite web|title="What Are the Major Contributions of Auguste Comte to Sociology?"|publisher=PreserveArticles.com: Preserving Your Articles for Eternity|accessdate=2012-02-24|url=http://www.preservearticles.com/201104306124/what-are-the-major-contributions-of-auguste-comte-to-sociology.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2015}} Comte broke this stage into 3 sub-stages:
:1A. [[Fetishism]] – Fetishism was the primary stage of the theological stage of thinking. Throughout this stage, primitive people believe that inanimate objects have living spirit in them, also known as animism. People worship inanimate objects like trees, stones, a piece of wood, volcanic eruptions, etc.&lt;ref name ="majorcontrib"/&gt; Through this practice, people believe that all things root from a supernatural source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maheshwari|first1=Dr. V.K.|title=Auguste Comte’s "Law of the Three Stages"|url=http://www.vkmaheshwari.com/WP/?p=694|website=vkmaheshwari|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1B. [[Polytheism]] – At one point, Fetishism began to bring about doubt in the minds of its believers. As a result, people turned towards polytheism: the explanation of things through the use of many Gods.  Primitive people believe that all natural forces are controlled by different Gods; a few examples would be God of water, God of rain, God of fire, God of air, God of earth, etc.&lt;ref name ="majorcontrib"/&gt;

:1C. [[Monotheism]] – Monotheism means believing in one God or God in one; attributing all to a single, supreme deity. Primitive people believe a single theistic entity is responsible for the existence of the universe.&lt;ref name ="majorcontrib"/&gt;

(2) The Metaphysical stage is the extension of the theological stage. Metaphysical stage refers to explanation by impersonal abstract concepts. People often tried to believe that God is an abstract being.&lt;ref name ="majorcontrib"/&gt; They believe that an abstract power or force guides and determines events in the world. Metaphysical thinking discards belief in a concrete God. The nature of inquiry was legal and rational in nature. For example: In Classical Hindu Indian society the principle of the transmigration of the soul, the conception of rebirth, notions of pursuant were largely governed by metaphysical uphill.&lt;ref name ="majorcontrib"/&gt;

(3) The [[Positivism|Positivity]] stage, also known as the scientific stage, refers to scientific explanation based on observation, experiment, and comparison. Positive explanations rely upon a distinct method, the [[scientific method]], for their justification. Today people attempt to establish cause and effect relationships. Positivism is a purely intellectual way of looking at the world; as well, it emphasizes observation and classification of data and facts. This is the highest, most evolved behavior according to Comte.&lt;ref name ="majorcontrib"/&gt;

Comte, however, was conscious of the fact that the three stages of thinking may or do coexist in the same society or in the same mind and may not always be successive.

Comte proposed a hierarchy of the sciences based on historical sequence, with areas of knowledge passing through these stages in order of complexity. The simplest and most remote areas of knowledge—mechanical or physical—are the first to become scientific. These are followed by the more complex sciences, those considered closest to us.

The sciences, then, according to Comte's "law", developed in this order: [[Mathematics]]; [[Astronomy]]; [[Physics]]; [[Chemistry]]; [[Biology]]; [[Sociology]]. A science ''of society'' is thus the "Queen science" in Comte's hierarchy as it would be the most fundamentally complex. 
Since Comte saw social science as an observation of human behavior and knowledge, his definition of sociology included observing humanity’s development of science itself. Because of this, Comte presented this introspective field of study as the science above all others. Sociology would both complete the body of positive sciences by discussing humanity as the last unstudied scientific field, and would link the fields of science together in human history, showing the "intimate interrelation of scientific and social development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kremer-Marietti |first1=Angèle |title="Positivism" |url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/CX3424502485/WHIC?u=redm07619&amp;sid=WHIC&amp;xid=e526fac8 |website=World History In Context |accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Comte, the law of three stages made development of sociology inevitable and necessary. Comte saw the formation of his law as an active use of sociology, but this formation was dependent on other sciences reaching the positive stage; Comte’s three-stage law would not have evidence for a positive stage without the observed progression of other sciences through these three stages. Thus, sociology and its first law of three stages would be developed after other sciences were developed out of the metaphysical stage, with the observation of these developed sciences becoming the scientific evidence used in a positive stage of sociology. This special dependence on other sciences contributed to Comte’s view of sociology being the most complex. It also provided an explanation for sociology being the last science to be developed.

Comte saw the results of his three-stage law and sociology as not only inevitable, but good. In Comte’s eyes, the positive stage was not only the most evolved stage, but also the stage best for mankind. Through a continuous development of positive sciences, Comte hoped that humans would perfect their knowledge of the world and make real progress to improve the welfare of humanity.&lt;ref name="Hackett Publishing Company, Inc"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kant |first1=Immanuel |title=Introduction to Positive Philosophy |date=1998 |publisher=Hackett Publishing Company, Inc. |location=Indianapolis |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acclaimed the positive stage as the "highest accomplishment of the human mind" &lt;ref name="Hackett Publishing Company, Inc"/&gt; and as having "natural superiority" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kant |first1=Immanuel |title=Introduction to Positive Philosophy |date=1998 |publisher=Hackett Publishing Company, Inc. |location=Indianapolis |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the other, more primitive stages.

Overall, Comte saw his law of three stages as the start of the scientific field of sociology as a positive science. He believed this development was the key to completing positive philosophy and would finally allow humans to study every observable aspect of the universe. For Comte, sociology’s human-centered studies would relate the fields of science to each other as progressions in human history and make positive philosophy one coherent body of knowledge. Comte presented the positive stage as the final state of all sciences, which would allow human knowledge to be perfected, leading to human progress.

==Critiques of the law==
Historian [[William Whewell]] wrote "Mr. Comte's arrangement of the progress of science as successively metaphysical and positive, is contrary to history in fact, and contrary to sound philosophy in principle."&lt;ref&gt;p.233 of ''On the Philosophy of Discovery: Chapters Historical and Critical (Including completion of the third edition of the philosophy of the inductive sciences)'', William Whewell, New York: Burt Franklin, 1860&lt;/ref&gt; The [[history of science|historian of science]] [[Floris Cohen|H. Floris Cohen]] has made a significant effort to draw the modern eye towards this first debate on the foundations of [[positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Floris Cohen, ''The Scientific Revolution: A Historiographical Inquiry'', University of Chicago Press 1994, p.35-39&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, within an entry dated early October 1838 [[Charles Darwin]] wrote in one of his then private notebooks that "M. Comte's idea of a theological state of science [is a] grand idea."&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/search-results?freetext=Comte's%20idea ''Notebook N (Metaphysics and Expression)'']. [[Charles Darwin]]. Journal's timespan: fall 1838—summer 1839. page[leaf] 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of genera in the '''soapberry family, [[Sapindaceae]]''', which includes the soapberries (''[[Sapindus]]''), maples (''[[Acer (plant)|Acer]]''), and [[paullinia]]s, amongst others. As currently circumscribed, the family contains approximatively 1900 species into over 140 genera classified into 4 subfamilies.&lt;ref name=Acevedo2011-FGVP/&gt;

== Current understanding ==
The current circumscription of Sapindaceae encompasses the traditional [[Aceraceae]] and [[Hippocastanaceae]] as tribes in subfamily Hippocastanoideae. Although the classification at subfamilial level is fairly well-established, the circumscription at tribal and generic level remains only partially resolved, especially in the larger subfamily Sapindoideae, which has led the most recent revision to treat the majority of these genera without placing them in a tribe.&lt;ref name=Acevedo2011-FGVP/&gt; Another recent study hints at even more incongruity between traditional circumscription and molecular evidence.&lt;ref name=Buerki2009/&gt;

Recent changes have included the synonymization of ''Distichostemon'' with ''[[Dodonaea]]'',&lt;ref name=Harrington2010/&gt; and ''Neotina'' and ''Tinopsis'' with ''[[Tina (plant)|Tina]]''.&lt;ref name=Buerki2010-tina/&gt; Additionally, not all authors agree about the broad circumscription that ensues from placing ''[[Xanthoceras]]'' as the sister group to the three traditional families as the resulting Sapindaceae ''[[sensu lato]]'', unlike the traditional families, is difficult to characterize.&lt;ref name=Acevedo2011-FGVP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buerki2010-xantho/&gt; As a result, the elevation of Xanthoceroideae to family level was recently proposed, which would remove from Sapindaceae those six genera currently placed in that subfamily and [[Hippocastanoideae]].&lt;ref name=Buerki2010-xantho/&gt;

This list follows Acevedo-Rodríguez et al.&lt;ref name=Acevedo2011-FGVP/&gt; as modified by more recent research.&lt;ref name=Harrington2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buerki2010-tina/&gt;&lt;ref name=Acevedo2011-allo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jimenez2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buerki2010-Gereaua/&gt;&lt;ref name=Acevedo2012/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23781">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Missouri''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of May 1, 2010, there were thirty Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Missouri]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One more site has been proposed for entry on the list and five others have been cleaned up and removed from it.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

Below is a '''list of artificial objects''' leaving the [[Solar System]]. All of these objects are space probes and their upper stages launched by [[NASA]]. 

Of the major spacecraft Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and New Horizons are still functioning and are regularly contacted by radio communication, while Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 are now derelict. In addition to these spacecraft, some 3rd stages and de-spin weights are leaving the solar system, assuming they continued on their trajectories. 

The objects are ''leaving'' the Solar System, because they have a velocity and direction that is taking them away from the Sun, but for the distance they are from the Sun, the Sun's gravitational pull would not be predicted to pull the object back to it or into orbit around it. They are not at all immune from the gravitational pull of the Sun and are being slowed down, but they are predicted to have enough velocity to coast into interstellar space; see [[escape velocity]].

==Planetary exploration probes==
*'''''[[Pioneer 10]]''''' – launched in 1972, flew past [[Jupiter]] in 1973 and is heading in the direction of [[Aldebaran]] (65 light years away) in the constellation of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. Contact was lost in January 2003.
*'''''[[Pioneer 11]]''''' – launched in 1973, flew past Jupiter in 1974 and [[Saturn]] in 1979. Contact was lost in November 1995.  The spacecraft is headed toward the constellation of [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], northwest of the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. Barring an  incident, ''Pioneer 11'' will pass near one of the stars in the constellation in about 4 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/missions/archive/pioneer.html|title=The Pioneer Missions|work=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''[[Voyager 2]]''''' – launched in August 1977, flew past Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981, [[Uranus]] in 1986, and [[Neptune]] in 1989. Although it entered the [[heliosheath]], it is debated whether it has passed the heliopause. ''Voyager 2'' is still active.
*'''''[[Voyager 1]]''''' – launched in September 1977, flew past Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, making a special close approach to Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. The probe passed the [[Heliopause (astronomy)#Heliopause|heliopause]] on 25 August 2012 to enter [[Interstellar medium|interstellar space]],&lt;ref&gt;

It is headed towards an encounter with a star called AC +79 3888, which lies 17.6 light-years from Earth, in about 40,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wall |first1=Mike |title=Interstellar Traveler: NASA's Voyager 1 Probe On 40,000-Year Trek to Distant Star |url=https://www.space.com/22783-voyager-1-interstellar-space-star-flyby.html |accessdate=4 June 2018 |date=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''[[New Horizons]]''''' – launched in 2006, the probe flew past Jupiter in 2007 and [[Pluto]] on 14 July 2015. It is currently headed towards a flyby of the [[Kuiper belt]] object [[(486958) 2014 MU69|{{mp|(486958) 2014 MU|69}}]] (nicknamed Ultima Thule) on January 1, 2019, as part of the Kuiper Belt Extended Mission (KEM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Brown |first=Dwayne |date=2016-07-01 |title=New Horizons Receives Mission Extension to Kuiper Belt, Dawn to Remain at Ceres |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-receives-mission-extension-to-kuiper-belt-dawn-to-remain-at-ceres |location=Washington, DC |publisher= |agency=NASA |access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although other probes were launched first, ''Voyager 1'' has achieved a higher speed and overtaken all others. ''Voyager 1'' overtook ''Voyager 2'' a few months after launch, on 19 December 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gebhardt|first1=Chris|last2=Goldader|first2=Jeff|title=Thirty-four years after launch, Voyager 2 continues to explore|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/08/thirty-four-years-voyager-2-continues-explore/|website=nasaspaceflight.com|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It overtook ''Pioneer 11'' in 1983,&lt;ref name="NMP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cranor|first1=David|title=When the Voyagers passed the Pioneers|url=http://nothingmorepowerful.blogspot.com/2017/12/when-voyagers-passed-pioneers.html|website=Nothing More Powerful|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then ''Pioneer 10''—becoming the probe farthest from Earth—on February 17, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/fastfacts.html|title=Voyager - The Interstellar Mission|work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Voyager 2'' is also moving faster than the probes launched earlier: having overtaken ''Pioneer 11'' by March 1988,&lt;ref name="NMP"/&gt; it will overtake ''Pioneer 10'' in April 2019.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Gebhardt, [https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/07/pioneer-10-first-probe-inner-precursor-juno/ Pioneer 10: first probe to leave the inner solar system &amp; precursor to Juno], in "nasaspaceflight.com" website, July 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on how the "[[Pioneer anomaly]]" impacts it, ''New Horizons'' will also probably pass the ''Pioneer'' probes, but will need many years to do so. It will not overtake ''Pioneer 11'' until the 22nd Century; will not overtake ''Pioneer 10'' until the end of that century, and it will never overtake the ''Voyagers''.&lt;ref name="NMP"/&gt;

==Propulsion stages==
[[File:PAM-D rocket stage.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Star-48 rocket motor like the one used to launch the ''New Horizons'' probe]]
Every planetary probe was placed into its escape trajectory by a [[multistage rocket]], the last stage of which ends up on nearly the same trajectory as the probe it launched. Because these stages cannot be actively guided, their trajectories are now different from the probes they launched (the probes were guided with small thrusters that allow course changes). However, in cases where the spacecraft acquired escape velocity because of a gravity assist, the stages may not have a similar course and there is the remote possibility that they collided with something. Some objects in heliocentric orbit have been reidentified with a telescope, and so it can be confirmed that they are still there. The stages on an escape trajectory are:
* ''Pioneer 10 third stage'', a TE364-4 variant of the [[Star 37|Star-37]] solid fuel rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/pioneer.html|title=NASA - NASA Glenn Pioneer Launch History|work=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Voyager 1 third stage'', a Star 37E solid fuel rocket.&lt;ref name="space.stackexchange.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/1940/where-are-the-upper-stages-for-the-voyager-pioneer-stages.html|title=rockets - Where are the upper stages for the Voyager/Pioneer stages? - Space Exploration Stack Exchange|website=stackexchange.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Voyager 2 third stage'', a Star 37E solid fuel rocket.&lt;ref name="space.stackexchange.com"/&gt;
* ''New Horizons third stage'', a [[Star 48B]] solid fuel rocket, is on a similar escape trajectory out of the Solar System as ''New Horizons'', even arriving at Jupiter by 6 hours before ''New Horizons''. On Oct 15, 2015 it passed through Pluto's orbit at a distance of 213 million kilometers (over 1 AU) distant from [[Pluto]].&lt;ref name=stern&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20101028 |first1=Alan|last1=Stern |first2=Yanping|last2=Guo |title=Where Is the New Horizons Centaur Stage? |date=October 28, 2010 |work=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=2079&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=37667|title=Star 48b Third-stage Motor - Unmanned Spaceflight.com|website=unmannedspaceflight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was nearly four months after the ''New Horizons'' probe did.&lt;ref name='space_nh'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/1991-derelict-booster-beat-pluto-probe-jupiter.html|title=Derelict Booster to Beat Pluto Probe to Jupiter|website=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, two small ''[[yo-yo de-spin]] weights'' on wires were used to reduce the spin of the ''New Horizons'' probe prior to its release from the third-stage rocket. Once the spin rate was lowered, these masses and the wires were released, and so are also on an escape trajectory out of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weebau.com/satplan/new%20horizons.htm|title=New Horizons|author=Pierre Bauduin|website=weebau.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnstonarchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/astro/awrjp493.html|title=Deep space probes and other manmade objects beyond near Earth space|website=johnstonsarchive.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these objects are trackable (they have no power or radio antennae, spin uncontrollably, and are too small to be detected), and their exact positions are unknowable beyond their projected Solar System escape trajectories.

The third stage of ''Pioneer 11'' is thought to be in solar orbit because its encounter with Jupiter would not have resulted in escape from the Solar System. ''Pioneer 11'' gained the required [[Escape velocity|velocity]] to escape the Solar System in its subsequent encounter with Saturn.&lt;ref name="space.stackexchange.com"/&gt;

The only objects to date to be launched directly into a solar escape trajectory were the ''New Horizons'' spacecraft, its third stage, and the two de-spin masses. The ''New Horizons'' [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] (second) stage is not escaping; it is in a 2.83-year heliocentric (solar) orbit.&lt;ref name=stern/&gt;

The ''Pioneer 10'' and ''11'', and ''Voyager 1'' and ''2'' Centaur (second) stages are also in heliocentric orbits.&lt;ref name="johnstonarchive"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://usspaceobjectsregistry.state.gov/Lists/SpaceObjects/DispFormaspx?ID=3348.html{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to leave the Solar System, the probe needs to reach the [[escape velocity]]. After leaving Earth, the Sun's escape velocity is 42.1&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;!-- According to [[escape velocity]]--&gt; In order to reach this speed, it is highly advantageous to utilize the orbital speed of the Earth around the Sun, which is 29.78&amp;nbsp;km/s. By passing near a planet, a probe can gain extra speed.

On  January 19, 2006 the [[New Horizons]] spacecraft to Pluto was launched directly into a solar-escape trajectory at {{convert|16.26|km/s|km/h mph|0|sp=us}} from Cape Canaveral using an Atlas V version with 5 of the [[AJ-60A]] SRBs and the [[Common Core Booster]], [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] upper stage, and [[Star 48|Star 48B]] third stage .&lt;ref name="sciam20130225"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-fastest-spacecraft-ever/ |title=The Fastest Spacecraft Ever? |work=Scientific American |first=Caleb A. |last=Scharf |date=February 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New Horizons'' passed the Moon's orbit in just nine hours.&lt;ref name="airspace20150710"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/first-mission-pluto-difficult-birth-new-horizons |title=First Mission to Pluto: The Difficult Birth of New Horizons |publisher=Smithsonian |first=Michael |last=Neufeld |date=July 10, 2015 |accessdate=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ils200601"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/The-Path-to-Pluto/FINAL-PLUTO_MO.pdf |title=New Horizons: Mission Overview |publisher=International Launch Services |date=January 2006 |accessdate=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LakeVostok-Location.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The location of Vostok Station in Antarctica]]

The lowest natural temperature ever directly recorded at [[Earth#Surface|ground level on Earth]] is {{convert|−89.2|C|F K}} at the Soviet [[Vostok Station]] in [[Antarctica]] on July 21, 1983 by ground measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = J. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = P. | last3 = Lachlan-Cope | first3 = T. | last4 = Colwell | first4 = S. | last5 = Phillips | first5 = T. | last6 = Kirchgaessner | first6 = A.

On August 10, 2010, satellite observations showed a surface temperature of {{convert|−93.2|C|F K}} at {{Coord|81.8|S|59.3|E}}, along a ridge between Dome Argus and [[Dome Fuji]], at {{convert|3900|m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-usgs-landsat-8-satellite-pinpoints-coldest-spots-on-earth/| title =NASA-USGS Landsat 8 Satellite Pinpoints Coldest Spots on Earth |publisher =[[NASA]]|date=Dec 9, 2013| accessdate = 10 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was reported at the 46th annual meeting of the [[American Geophysical Union]] in San Francisco in December 2013; it is a provisional figure, and may be subject to revision.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25287806| title =Coldest spot on Earth identified by satellite |publisher =[[BBC]]|date=9 December 2013| accessdate = 10 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value is not listed as the record lowest temperature as it was measured by [[remote sensing]] from satellite and not by ground-based [[thermometer]]s, unlike the 1983 record.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2013/12/10/antarctica-cold-record/3950019/| title =World Record Cold in Antarctica? |publisher =[[usatoday]]|date=9 December 2013| accessdate = 10 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature announced reflects that of the ice surface, while the Vostok readings measured the air above the ice, and so the two are not directly comparable. More recent work&lt;ref&gt;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GL078133&lt;/ref&gt; shows many locations in the high Antarctic where surface temperatures drop to approximately {{convert|−98|C|F K}}. Due to the very strong temperature gradient near the surface, these imply near-surface air temperature minima of approximately {{convert|−94|C|F K}}.

==Historical progression==
On January 21, 1838 a recording was made by the Russian merchant Neverov in [[Yakutsk]], of {{convert|−60|C|F K}}.&lt;ref name="noaa"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/086/mwr-086-01-0006.pdf | title = On the lowest temperatures on Earth|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|author=Nina Stepanova|date=Jan 30, 1958|accessdate = 10 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 15, 1885 H.

Soviet researchers later announced a recording of {{convert|−67.7|C|F K}} in February 1933 at [[Oymyakon]], about {{convert|650|km|abbr=on}} to the south-east of Verkhoyansk; this measurement was reported by Soviet texts through the 1940s as a record low, with the previous measurement from Verkhoyansk retroactively adjusted to {{convert|−67.6|C|F K}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0032247400048592|title=The coldest place on earth|journal=Polar Record|volume=6|issue=46|pages=821|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laboratory cooling==
{{Details|Absolute zero#History}}
===Early experiments===

In 1904 Dutch scientist [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] created a special lab in [[Leiden]] with the aim of producing [[liquid helium]]. In 1908 he managed to lower the temperature to less than −269&amp;nbsp;°C (-452.2 F, 4&amp;nbsp;K), which is less than four degrees above [[absolute zero]]. Only in this exceptionally cold state will helium liquefy, the boiling point of helium being at −268.94&amp;nbsp;°C (-452.092 F). Kamerlingh Onnes received a [[Nobel Prize]] for his achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1913/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1913|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onnes' method relied upon depressurising the subject gases, causing them to cool by [[adiabatic cooling]].{{Citation needed|date = July 2012}} This follows from the first law of thermodynamics;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = \Delta Q - \Delta W&lt;/math&gt;

where ''U'' = [[internal energy]], ''Q'' = [[heat]] added to the system, ''W'' = [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] done by the system.

Consider a gas in a box of set volume. If the pressure in the box is higher than atmospheric pressure, then upon opening the box our gas will do work on the surrounding atmosphere to expand. As this expansion is [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] and the gas has done work

&lt;math&gt;\Delta Q = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta W &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \Delta U &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

Now as the internal energy has decreased, so has the temperature.{{citation needed|date = July 2012}}

===Modern experiments===

As of November 2000, [[nuclear spin]] temperatures below 100 pK were reported for an experiment at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] Low Temperature Lab.  However, this was the temperature of one particular type of motion—a quantum property called nuclear spin—not the overall average thermodynamic temperature for all possible degrees of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;The experimental methods and results are presented in detail in Tauno A. Knuuttila’s D.Sc. thesis which can be accessed from [https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/2302 Aaltodoc]. The university’s press release on its achievement is [http://ltl.hut.fi/Low-Temp-Record.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; At such low temperatures, the concept of "[[temperature]]" becomes multifaceted since molecular motion cannot be assumed to average out across degrees of freedom.{{citation needed|date = July 2012}} The corresponding peak emission will be in radio waves, rather than in the familiar infrared, so it is very inefficiently absorbed by neighboring atoms, making it difficult to reach thermal equilibrium.

Low Temperature Laboratory recorded a record low temperature of 100&amp;#160;[[1 E-12 K|pK]], or 1.0&amp;#160;×&amp;#160;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#160;K in 1999.&lt;ref name="recordcold"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ltl.tkk.fi/wiki/LTL/World_record_in_low_temperatures | title = World record in low temperatures|accessdate = 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current apparatus for achieving low temperatures has two stages. The first utilizes a [[Dilution refrigerator|helium dilution refrigerator]] to get to temperatures of millikelvins, then the next stage uses [[Adiabatic demagnetization|adiabatic nuclear demagnetisation]] to reach picokelvins.{{citation needed|date = July 2012}}

Extremely low temperatures are useful for observation of [[quantum mechanic]]al phases of matter such as [[superfluid]]s and [[Bose-Einstein condensate]]s, which would be disrupted by thermal motion.

The '''Madrean pine-oak woodlands''' is an [[ecoregion]] of the [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]] [[biome]], located in [[North America]]. They are [[subtropical]] [[woodland]]s found in the mountains of [[Mexico]] and the [[southwestern United States]].

[[Conservation International]] estimates the woodlands' original area at 461,265&amp;nbsp;km². The woodlands are surrounded at lower elevations by other [[ecoregion]]s, mostly tropical and subtropical [[deserts and xeric shrublands]], forests, and [[grassland]]s. Woodland areas were isolated from one another and from the pine-oak woodlands of the Sierra Madre Occidental to the south by the warming and drying of the climate since the 1st century CE.

==Distribution==
===Mexico===
[[File:Pino-encino.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Pines and oaks coexist in the Nealtican [[Malpaís (landform)|Malpaís]] ([[Tianguismanalco]], [[Puebla]])]]

The Madrean pine-oak woodlands are found at higher elevations in Mexico's major mountain ranges, the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], the [[Trans-Mexican volcanic belt]], the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]], the [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca]], the [[Peninsular Ranges]] of the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. 

===Madrean sky islands===
There are also approximately 27 enclaves in southern [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] and in western [[Texas]], where they are known as the "[[Madrean sky islands]]".  The major Madrean "sky island" ranges in Arizona are the [[Dragoon Mountains]], [[Chiricahua Mountains]], [[Pinaleno Mountains|Pinaleño Mountains]], [[Santa Catalina Mountains]], [[Rincon Mountains]], [[Santa Rita Mountains]], and Tumacacori Highlands. In New Mexico, the [[Sacramento Mountains]] and [[Guadalupe Mountains]], which extend into Texas, as well as the [[Davis Mountains]] and [[Chisos Mountains]], are also forested Madrean sky islands.

[[File:Bosque Cajonos.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Madrean pine-oak woodlands in the [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca]], México.]]

==Flora==
The pine-oak woodlands are composed of stands of [[oak]] ''(Quercus)'', [[pine]] ''(Pinus)'', [[douglas-fir]] ''(Pseudotsuga)'' and [[fir]] ''(Abies)''. The trees generally occur in mixed stands, though monospecific stands are sometimes found. 

The pine-oak woodlands are home to one-quarter of Mexico's plant species, and Mexico is home to 44 of the 110 species of pine and over 135 species of oak, over 28% of the world's oak species. 

Plant species descended from Madro-Tertiary flora, Madrean ancestor species, are an important element of the [[California chaparral and woodlands]] ecoregion.

==Madrean pine-oak woodlands sub-ecoregions==
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] recognizes several distinct Madrean pine-oak woodlands sub−ecoregions, based on geographic distribution and species mix.&lt;br/&gt;
They include:
* [[Sierra Juárez and San Pedro Mártir pine-oak forests]] of the [[Sierra de Juárez]] and [[Sierra de San Pedro Mártir]] ranges of the northern [[Baja California peninsula]].
* [[Sierra de la Laguna pine-oak forests]] of the [[Sierra de la Laguna]] in the southern Baja California peninsula.
* [[Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests]] extend along the Sierra Madre Occidental range from the [[Rio Grande de Santiago]] in Mexico's [[Jalisco]] state through [[Nayarit]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Durango]], [[Sonora]], and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], and include the Madrean Sky Islands of Arizona and New Mexico.
* [[Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests]] extend along the Sierra Madre Oriental ranges of Texas and Mexico, from mountaintop enclaves in west [[Texas]] through [[Coahuila]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Nuevo León]], [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Querétaro]] and [[Guanajuato]].
* [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests]]
* [[Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests]]
* [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca pine-oak forests]]

The '''Mediterranean ''Acacia-Argania'' dry woodlands and succulent thickets''' is a [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] ecoregion in North Africa centered mainly on Morocco but also including northwestern Western Sahara and the eastern Canary Islands. 

==Geography==
This ecoregion occupies {{convert|1000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Morocco]], northwestern [[Western Sahara]], and the eastern [[Canary Islands]] ([[Lanzarote]], [[Fuerteventura]], and associated islets). On the African mainland, it encompasses the Atlantic coastal plain, the lowlands of [[Al Haouz Province]], the valleys of the [[Sous River]] and [[Draa River]], and the westernmost part of the High Atlas and [[Anti-Atlas]] Mountains.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; 

It has either a [[Mediterranean climate]] or a [[semi-arid climate]] or even an [[Desert climate|arid climate]] given that mean annual rainfall is below {{convert|500|mm|in}} and falls as low as {{convert|50|mm|in}} in the driest areas of the ecoregion. The winters are mild and frost-free and the summers relatively cool because of the moderating influence of the ocean. Temperatures average {{convert|18|to|20|C|F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

The Mediterranean ''Acacia-Argania'' dry woodlands and succulent thickets ecoregion is bounded on the north by the [[Mediterranean woodlands and forests]], on the east by the [[North Saharan steppe and woodlands]], on the south by the [[Atlantic coastal desert]], and on the west by the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

==Ecology==
The chief plant communities in the ecoregion are dominated by ''[[Argania spinosa]]'' accompanied by [[Acacia]]s, and the predominant lower vegetation is [[succulent plant|succulent]] [[shrubland]] dominated by [[Euphorbia]]s. Some of the associated plant species are ''[[Periploca laevigata]]'', ''[[Senecio anthephorbium]]'', ''[[Launaea arborescens]]'', ''[[Warionia saharae]]'', ''[[Acacia gummifera]]'', ''[[Rhus trpartitum]]'', ''[[Withania frutescens]]'', ''[[Euphorbia officinarum]]'', ''[[Cytisus albidus]]'', ''[[Ephedra altissima]]'' and ''[[Tetraclinis articulata]]''.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

There are a number of plants endemic to the Canary Islands part of the ecoregion, and the [[white-toothed shrew]] is the only mammal endemic there. On the mainland, a number of mammals are found in this ecoregion. These include the [[honey badger]], [[European wildcat]], [[Egyptian mongoose]], [[Barbary ground squirrel]], [[North African elephant shrew]], [[Hoogstraal's gerbil]], [[Barbary striped grass mouse]] and [[wild boar]]. Other, rarer mammals include [[caracal]], [[African wildcat]], [[dorcas gazelle]], [[Cuvier's gazelle]] and [[Barbary sheep]].&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

'''Nang Ta-khian''' ({{lang-th|นางตะเคียน}}; "Lady of Ta-khian") is a female [[spirit]] of the [[folklore]] of [[Thailand]]. It manifests itself as a woman that haunts ''[[Hopea odorata]]'' trees. These are very large trees known as ''Ta-khian'' (ตะเคียน) in Thai, hence her name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skn.ac.th/skl/skn42/ghost55/g2.htm Nang Ta-khian drawing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
The '''Nang Ta-khian''' belong to a type of [[spirit]]s or [[fairy|fairies]] related to trees and known generically in [[Thai folklore]] as ''[[Nang Mai]]'' (นางไม้; "Lady of the Tree").&lt;ref name="Phi"&gt;[http://www.thaiworldview.com/bouddha/animism5.htm Spirits]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Legends in the Thai [[oral tradition]] say the spirit inhabits a Ta-khian tree and sometimes appears as a beautiful young woman wearing traditional Thai attire, usually in reddish or brownish colours, contrasting with ''[[Nang Tani]]'' who is mostly represented in a green dress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tumnandd.com/wp-content/uploads/takien.jpg Nang Ta-khian image]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nang Ta-khian is generally a [[Silvanus (mythology)|sylvan]] spirit, for the Ta-khian is a tall, massive tree that can live for centuries, naturally found in the forest and not near inhabited areas. As it has a large trunk and a wide-spreading root system, it is normally not planted close to homesteads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloggang.com/data/bite25/picture/1178183822.jpg Ta-khian tree base with lengths of brocade as Nang Ta-khian offerings]&lt;/ref&gt; Like all ''Nang Mai'', Nang Ta-khian haunts the immediate environment of her tree and she may also [[Haunted house|haunt a house]] having beams, stilts or pillars made from Ta-khian wood.

The tree is almost never felled for lumber, since the spirit will be furious and follow the wood. About the only place Ta-khian is used as lumber is in a [[Buddhist monastery]], where the merit of the monks is considered sufficient to render the spirit harmless. Traditionally trees where Ta-khian resides have lengths of colored [[satin]] cloth wrapped around their trunk. In order to protect venerable old trees from [[logging]], [[Buddhist monk]]s use to wrap lengths of satin around them and in case of having to cut the tree a special ceremony had to be performed to ask for permission. However, in present times some of these very ancient trees are felled anyway for their wood, even though it is said to be dangerous for a person to cut such a tree without the previous consent of the spirit inhabiting it.&lt;ref name="Phi"/&gt;

==Temples and shrines==
In some parts of Thailand, Nang Ta-khian has become a popular [[tree deity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotobug.net/forum/attachments/month_1103/1103020030d0133e5881f590a4.jpg Nang Ta-khian statue with offerings]&lt;/ref&gt; Miracles are attributed to her power and not only living trees, but also logs, beams or [[keel]]s of wooden boats where the spirit is deemed to reside are an object of pilgrimage and have lengths of colored silk tied as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.tlcthai.com/news/41148.html 9-year old asked Lady Ta-khian for help (Thai)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409140344/http://news.tlcthai.com/news/41148.html |date=2014-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In present times Nang Ta-Khian is usually propitiated in order to be lucky in the [[lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.mthai.com/blog/32621.html 10 อันดับ สถานที่ขอหวย ที่ฮิตมากที่สุด ในประเทศไทย]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''opposition surge''' (sometimes known as the '''opposition effect''', '''opposition spike''' or '''Seeliger effect'''&lt;ref name=Hameen-Anttila&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hameen-Anttila|first=K.A. |last2=Pyykko|first2=S. |title=Photometric behaviour of Saturn's rings as a function of the saturnocentric latitudes of the Earth and the Sun |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |date=July 1972 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=235–247 |bibcode = 1972A&amp;A....19..235H }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the brightening of a rough surface, or an object with many [[particle]]s, when illuminated from directly behind the observer. The term is most widely used in [[astronomy]], where generally it refers to the sudden noticeable increase in the brightness of a [[celestial body]] such as a [[planet]], [[moon]], or [[comet]] as its [[phase angle]] of observation approaches zero. It is so named because the reflected light from the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]] appear significantly brighter than predicted by simple [[Lambertian reflectance]] when at [[Opposition (astronomy)|astronomical opposition]]. Two physical mechanisms have been proposed for this observational phenomenon: shadow hiding and coherent backscatter.

==Overview==

The phase angle is defined as the angle between the observer, the observed object and the source of light.  In the case of the solar system, the light source is the Sun, and the observer is situated on Earth. At zero phase angle, the Sun is directly behind the observer and the object is directly ahead, fully illuminated.

As the phase angle of an object lit by the Sun decreases, the object's brightness rapidly increases. This is mainly due to the increased area lit, but is also partly due to the intrinsic brightness of the part that is sunlit. This is affected by such factors as the angle at which light reflected from the object is observed. For this reason, a full moon is more than twice as bright as the moon at first or third quarter, even though the visible area illuminated appears to be exactly twice as large.

==Physical mechanisms==

===Shadow hiding===

When the angle of reflection is close to the angle at which the light's rays hit the surface (that is, when the sun and the object are close to [[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] from the viewpoint of the observer), this intrinsic brightness is usually close to its maximum. At a phase angle of zero degrees, all shadows disappear and the object is fully illuminated. When phase angles approach zero, there is a sudden increase in apparent brightness, and this sudden increase is referred to as the opposition surge.

The effect is particularly pronounced on [[regolith]] surfaces of airless bodies in the [[solar system]]. The usual major cause of the effect is that a surface's small pores and pits that would otherwise be in shadow at other incidence angles become lit up when the observer is almost in the same line as the source of illumination.  The effect is usually only visible for a very small range of [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angles]] near zero. For bodies whose reflectance properties have been quantitatively studied, details of the opposition effect – its strength and angular extent – are described by two of the [[Hapke parameters]]. In the case of planetary rings (such as [[Rings of Saturn|Saturn's]]), an opposition surge is due to the uncovering of shadows on the ring particles. This explanation was first proposed by [[Hugo von Seeliger]] in 1887.&lt;ref name=volSeeliger&gt;{{cite journal|last=von Seeliger|first=H.|title=Zur Theorie der Beleuchtung der grossen Planeten insbesondere des Saturn|journal=Abh. Bayer. Akad. Wiss. Math. Naturwiss. Kl.|date=1887|volume=16|pages=405–516|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coherent backscatter===
{{main|Coherent backscattering}}
A theory for an additional effect that increases brightness during opposition is that of coherent backscatter.&lt;ref&gt;Hapke, B. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990Icar...88..407H Coherent Backscatter: An Explanation for the Unusual Radar Properties of Outer Planet Satellites] ''Icarus'' '''88''': 407:417.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of coherent backscatter, the reflected light is enhanced at narrow angles if the size of the scatterers in the surface of the body is comparable to the wavelength of light and the distance between scattering particles is greater than a wavelength.  The increase in brightness is due to the reflected light combining coherently with the emitted light.

Coherent backscatter phenomena have also been observed with [[radar]].  In particular, recent observations of Titan at 2.2&amp;nbsp;cm with [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] have shown that a strong coherent backscatter effect is required to explain the high albedos at radar wavelengths.&lt;ref name="Janssen2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janssen|first=M.A. |first2=A.|last2=Le Gall |first3=L.C.|last3=Wye |date=2011|title=Anomalous radar backscatter from Titan’s surface?|journal=Icarus|volume=212|issue=1|pages=321–328|issn=0019-1035|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.11.026|bibcode = 2011Icar..212..321J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Throughout the Solar System==

The existence of the opposition surge was described in 1956 by [[Tom Gehrels]] during his study of the reflected light from an asteroid.&lt;ref&gt;Gehrels, T. (1956) "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1956ApJ...123..331G Photometric Studies of Asteroids. V: The Light-Curve and Phase Function of 20 Massalia]". ''Astrophysical Journal'' '''195''': 331-338.&lt;/ref&gt; Gehrels' later studies showed that the same effect could be shown in the moon's brightness.&lt;ref&gt;Gehrels, T.; Coffeen, T.; &amp; Owings, D. (1964) "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1964AJ.....69..826G Wavelength dependence of polarization. III. The lunar surface]". ''Astron. J.'' '''69''': 826-852.&lt;/ref&gt;  He coined the term "opposition effect" for the phenomenon, but the more intuitive "opposition surge" is now more widely used.

Since Gehrels' early studies, an opposition surge has been noted for most airless solar system bodies. No such surge has been reported for bodies with significant atmospheres.

In the case of the [[Moon]], B. J. Buratti ''et al.'' have suggested that its brightness increases by some 40% between a phase angle of 4° and one of 0°, and that this increase is greater for the rougher-surfaced highland areas than for the relatively smooth [[mare (lunar surface)|maria]]. As for the principal mechanism of the phenomenon, measurements indicate that the opposition effect exhibits only a small wavelength dependence: the surge is 3-4% larger at 0.41 μm than at 1.00 μm. This result suggests that the principal cause of the lunar opposition surge is shadow-hiding rather than coherent backscatter.&lt;ref&gt;Burrati, B. J.; Hillier, J. K.; &amp; Wang, M. (1996) "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996Icar..124..490B The Lunar Opposition Surge: Observations by Clementine]". ''Icarus'' '''124''': 490-499.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Positions_of_Near_Earth_Asteroids_at_time_of_discovery.png|800px|align-cap=center|Due to the opposition effect over half (53%) of the discoveries of [[Near Earth object]]s were made in 3.8% of the sky, in a 22.5° [[Spherical cap|cone]] facing directly away from the Sun, and the vast majority (87%) were made in 15% of the sky, in a 45° [[Spherical cap|cone]] facing away from the Sun.&lt;ref name="NASA-NEO-Close-Approach-Data"&gt;{{cite web |title=NEO Earth Close Approach data |url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/ |website=NASA JPL |publisher=NASA |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Sacred oak oley pa.jpeg|thumb|Sacred Oak Tree with visitors for size comparison.]]
'''The Sacred Oak''' is a more-than-500-year-old Chinkapin Oak located in the [[Oley Valley]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It sits in a grove of trees just off Friedensburg Road.

==The legend of the Sacred Oak==
According to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native-American]] [[legend]], a beautiful woman, the wife of a powerful chief, became very ill. All the tribe's medicine men were called in; they "pow-wowed" and administered herbal medicines, to no effect. Slowly, the chief's wife became weaker and sicker. Finally, desperate for a cure, the young chief traveled to the Sacred Oak and there prayed to the [[Great Spirit]] for his wife to be saved. Amazingly, when he returned to camp, his wife was well again. Several years went by and the tribe was threatened by a hostile tribe. Once again, the chief traveled to the Sacred Oak and prayed to the Great Spirit, who gave him guidance. The chief gathered blankets and beads and journeyed the camp of the enemy. His gifts were accepted, and before he left, he smoked the pipe of peace with the chief of the other tribe. From then on, the Sacred Oak was looked upon as the shrine tree of the [[Lenape|Delaware Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Native Americans and Trees|url=http://www.americanforests.org/our-programs/american-forests-publications/forest-files/forest-files-november-2012/native-americans-and-trees/|website=American Forests|publisher=American Forests|accessdate=2014-09-30|ref=American Forests website, Forest Files November 2012, Native Americans and Trees}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went to the Sacred Oak in times of trouble to pray, and legend has it that help was always given to them.  Legend says that the oak also has caused adverse effects to ones who have wronged or disrespected the oak.  According to legend, the son of a high Lenape chief once urinated on the oak.  Later that same day the ten-year-old disappeared into the woods of Oley never to be found.

==The Sacred Oak today==
Today, the Sacred Oak still grows in a forested area just off Friedensburg Road in [[Oley Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Oley Township]]. In the past, people were allowed to visit the tree, but now the land is considered private property and is off limits to visitors due to evidence and sightings of pagan worship ceremonies. This includes numerous spottings of robed individuals near the tree, ritualistic items on the surrounding rocks, and multiple animal carcasses.  The land was recently sold to a new owner, who has begun raising money to help preserve the Sacred Oak. In 2007, the leader of the [[Lenape Nation Council]], Chief Gentlemoon led two ceremonies to revitalize the tree. The tree was fertilized and deadwood was trimmed to help the tree continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Mary E.|title=Ceremony intended as healing for oak|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=47231|accessdate=2014-09-30|work=Reading Eagle|date=2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wood is being used for a variety of things, including being made into pens by a local craftsmen and Native-Americans all over the country.  The Sacred Oak is currently the biggest tree in Berks County and is on the [http://www.pabigtrees.com/tree_detail.aspx?tree=TR20100930213406827 Pennsylvania Forestry Association's Champion Trees of Pennsylvania website].
Update 12/3/09
The Sacred Oak is only open to the public twice per year. The two dates for public access are available on the Sacred Oak Facebook page or if you contact Oley Township.

Elders of the Lenni Lenape tribe have certified the tree has been venerated for 480+ years.  The current owner, a horticulturist, places the tree's age at approximately 700 years.

UPDATE 2014:  New property owner again.  Public access is limited to two times per year.  Dates for public access are on the sacred oak facebook page or are available if you contact Oley Township.

The '''South Sakhalin-Kurile mixed forests''' [[ecoregion]] (WWF ID:PA0438) is split between the southwest region of [[Sakhalin Island]], and the southern three islands of the [[Kurile Islands]] chain in the [[Russian Far East]].  The ecoregion is in the [[Palearctic ecozone]], with a Humid Continental climate.  It covers {{convert|12432|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="gs-1"&gt;{{cite web|title=South Sakhalin-Kurile mixed forests|url=https://www.globalspecies.org/ecoregions/display/PA0438|website=Ecoregions of the World|publisher=GlobalSpecies.org|access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and description ==
The Sakhalin Island side of the ecoregion faces the [[Sea of Japan]] to the west, and the [[Okhotsk Sea]] to the east.  Being on the southern end of the island, plant life is denser and more varied.  The Kurile Islands side of the ecoregion has high levels of biodiversity, reflecting the islands' position along the meeting of warm and cold sea currents (the [[Pacific Ocean]] and Okhotsk Sea, respectively).  The resulting richness of marine life attracts large colonies of marine birds.  The ecoregion in the Kurils is defined as the southern three islands: [[Kunashir Island]], [[Iturup]], and [[Shikotan]].  These islands were connected to the Japanese island of [[Hokkaido]] during the most recent glacial period, and unlike the northern two thirds of the Kuriles are not icebound in winter.&lt;ref name="gs-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wwf2"&gt;{{cite web|title=PA0438: Russia|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa0438|publisher=World Wildlife Federation|access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ikip"/&gt;

== Climate ==
The region has a [[Humid continental climate|Humid continental, hot summer climate]] (Koppen classification [[Humid continental climate#Koppen Dfa|(Dfa)]]).  This climate is characterized by high variation in temperature, both daily and seasonally; with dry winters and cool summers.  The "hot summer" designation indicates that at least one month per year averages above {{convert|22|C|F}}.

== Flora and fauna ==
The area is characterized by high biodiversity because of the relatively mild climate, transition-zone placement, and island location.&lt;ref name="ikip"&gt;{{cite web|title=IKIP International Kurile Islands Project|url=https://depts.washington.edu/ikip/index.html|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The flora of the southern Kuriles is closely related to that of Hokkaido, and endemism is low.  A dominant floral community in the southern Kuriles is the bamboo thicket.  Snow falling on the evergreen bamboo thickets in winter insulate the understory, which is relatively empty but abounding in shrews, mice and other rodents.  These animals also thrive in the high-growth thickets, typified by white clover and "Sakhalin buckwheat" ([[Polygonum|Reynoutrua sachalinensis]]).&lt;ref name="kurilsky"&gt;{{cite web|title=Territory of Kurilsky Nature Reserve|url=http://www.kurilskiy.ru/?territory#%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%20%D1%85%D0%B0%D1%80|publisher=Kurilsky Nature Reserve (official site)|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although plant communities are favorable to rodents, a noteworthy feature of the animal life in the southern Kuriles is the predominance of predator species, such as fox, sable, and bear, which have had to develop broader sources of food, particular marine sources on the coasts.  Salmon are abundant in the streams.&lt;ref name="kurilsky"/&gt;

== Protections ==
Notable protected areas of the Russian Federation in the ecoregion include:
* [[Kurils Nature Reserve]], which covers the north and south regions of [[Kunashir Island]] in the Kurils. (Area: 654 km2)
This is an IUCN class Ia "strict ecological reserves" ([[Zapovednik]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1205">The '''Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forest]] ecoregion of the island of [[Sri Lanka]]. The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|48,400|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, which includes most of the island of [[Sri Lanka]], with the exception of the islands' southwestern corner and central highlands, home to the [[Sri Lanka lowland rain forests]] and [[Sri Lanka montane rain forests]] ecoregions, respectively, and the northern [[Jaffna Peninsula]], part of the [[Deccan thorn scrub forests]] ecoregion.

The Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests are made up mostly of evergreen trees, which distinguish them from the deciduous trees that characterize most other tropical dry broadleaf forest ecoregions. The dry-zone dry evergreen forests most closely resemble the [[East Deccan dry evergreen forests]] of India's southeast coast.

[[Image:Low creek.jpg|right|thumb|A stream bed [[armor (hydrology)|armored]] with rocks]]
A '''stream bed''' or '''streambed''' is the channel bottom of a [[stream]] or [[river]], the physical confine of the normal water flow.  The lateral confines or channel margins are known as the stream [[Bank (geography)|bank]]s or river banks, during all but [[flood stage]]. Under certain conditions a river can branch from one stream bed to multiple stream beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jerolmack|first=Douglas J.|last2=Mohrig|first2=David|title=Conditions for branching in depositional rivers|url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/35/5/463.short|journal=Geology|volume=35|issue=5|pages=463–466|year=2007|doi=10.1130/G23308A.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[flood]] occurs when a stream overflows its banks and flows onto its [[flood plain]]. As a general rule, the bed is the part of the [[stream channel|channel]] up to the normal water line, and the banks are that part above the normal water line. However, because water flow varies, this differentiation is subject to local interpretation.  Usually, the bed is kept clear of terrestrial [[vegetation]], whereas the banks are subjected to water flow only during unusual or perhaps infrequent high water stages and therefore might support vegetation some or much of the time.[[File:Old Mississippi riverbed near St. Mary's.jpg|thumb|The old bed of the [[Mississippi River]] near [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]], left behind after the river shifted|left]]

[[File:Digging for drinking water in a dry riverbed (6220146368).jpg|thumb|A woman digs in a dry stream bed in [[Kenya]] to find water during a drought.]]
The nature of any stream bed is always a function of the flow dynamics and the local geologic materials, influenced by that flow. With small streams in [[mesophyte|mesophytic]] regions, the nature of the stream bed is strongly responsive to conditions of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] [[surface runoff|runoff]]. Where natural conditions of either [[grassland]] or [[forest]] ameliorate peak flows, stream beds are stable, possibly rich, with organic matter and exhibit minimal scour. These streams support a rich biota. Where conditions produce unnatural levels of runoff, such as occurs below roads, the stream beds will exhibit a greater amount of scour, often down to bedrock and banks may be undercut. This process greatly increases watershed erosion and results in thinner soils, upslope from the stream bed, as the channel adjusts to the increase in flow. The stream bed is very complex in terms of erosion. Sediment is transported, eroded and deposited on the stream bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=Marcelo|last2=Parker|first2=Gary|title=Entrainment of Bed Sediment into Suspension|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1991)117:4(414)|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|language=en|volume=117|issue=4|year=1991|pages=414–435|doi=10.1061/(asce)0733-9429(1991)117:4(414)}}&lt;/ref&gt; With global warming there is a fear that the size and shape of riverbeds will change due to increased flood magnitude and frequency. However, one study has shown that the majority of sediment washed out in floods is "near-threshold" sediment that has been deposited during normal flow and only needs a slightly higher flow to become mobile again. This shows that the stream bed is left mostly unchanged in size and shape.&lt;ref name=" Phillips&amp;Jerolmack2016"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6286/694 | title=Self-organization of river channels as a critical filter on climate signals | first=Colin B. | last=Phillips | first2=Douglas J. | last2=Jerolmack | journal=Science | year=2016 | volume=352 | pages=694–697 | doi=10.1126/science.aad3348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beds are usually what would be left once a stream is no longer in existence; the beds are usually well preserved even if they get buried, because the walls and canyons made by the stream usually have hard walls, usually soft sand and debris fill the bed. Dry stream beds are also subject to becoming underground water pockets (buried stream beds only) and flooding by heavy rains and water rising from the ground and may sometimes be part of the rejuvenation of the stream.

The '''tallgrass prairie''' is an [[ecosystem]] native to central [[North America]]. Natural and [[Anthropogenic hazard#Fire|anthropogenic fire]], as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of  periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass [[prairie]]s expanded throughout the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]] and smaller portions of southern [[Aspen parkland|central Canada]], from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the [[Flint Hills]] in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba.

They were characteristically found in the [[central forest-grasslands transition]], the [[central tall grasslands]], the [[upper Midwest forest-savanna transition]], and the [[northern tall grasslands]] [[List of terrestrial ecoregions (WWF)|ecoregions]].  They flourished in areas with rich [[loess]] soils and moderate rainfall around 30-35 inches (700–900&amp;nbsp;mm) per year. To the east were the [[Fire ecology|fire-maintained]] [[Eastern savannas of the United States|eastern savannas]].  In the northeast, where fire was infrequent and periodic [[windthrow]] represented the main source of disturbance, [[beech-maple forest]]s dominated. In contrast, [[shortgrass prairie]] was typical in the western [[Great Plains]], where rainfall is less frequent and soils are less fertile.  Due to expansive agricultural land use, very little tallgrass prairie remains.

==History of origin and demise==
Retreating glaciers deposited the parent material for soil in the form of [[till]], i.e. unsorted sediment, about 10,000 years ago. Wind-dropped [[loess]] and organic matter accumulated, resulting in deep levels{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs references to reliable sources.|date=May 2016}} of [[topsoil]]. Animals such as bison, elk, deer, and rabbits added nitrogen to the soil through urine and feces. [[Prairie dogs]], a ground squirrel-like rodent considered to be a [[keystone species]], dug tunnels that "aerated the soil and channeled water several feet below the surface."&lt;ref name="csa.com"&gt;Pam Graham: “Tallgrass Prairie”ProQuest Discovery Guides http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/discoveryguides-main.php Released November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
For 5,000 to 8,000 years, more than {{convert|240|e6acre|km2}} of prairie grasslands were a major feature of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calacademy.org/sciencetoday/microbes-beneath-the-surface/5512848/|title=Microbes Beneath the Surface|work=Science Today: California Academy of Sciences|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1800 and 1930, the vast majority was destroyed. Settlers transformed what they named "the Great American Desert" or "The Inland Sea" into farmland. Major reasons for the prairie's demise were the confined grazing pattern of European cattle versus bison, the near-extermination of prairie dogs, and the plowing and cultivation of the land, which breached tallgrass root systems and interrupted reproduction. Further, extensive [[tile drainage]] has changed the soil's water content and hydrodynamics, and ongoing soil erosion results in its increasing loss.

Estimates differ of how much original tallgrass prairie survives, ranging from less than 1% mostly in "scattered remnants found in pioneer cemeteries, restoration projects, along highways and railroad rights-of-way, and on steep bluffs high above rivers"&lt;ref name="csa.com"/&gt; to 4%.

==Ecosystem==
Tallgrass prairie is capable of supporting significant biodiversity.  Parts of the ecoregion among the "top ten ecoregions for reptiles, birds, butterflies, and tree species. Tallgrass species are found in the understory layer."&lt;ref name="Centralforestgrasslands"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0804|name=Central forest-grasslands transition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oak  ([[blackjack oak]] (''Quercus marilandica'') and [[post oak]] (''Q. stellata'') ) and [[hickory]] tree species occur in some areas, but generally in moderate densities. [[Bison]] (''Bison bison'') were a dominant species.&lt;ref name="Centralforestgrasslands" /&gt;

The tallgrass prairie [[biome]] depends on prairie fires, a form of [[wildfire]], for its survival and renewal.&lt;ref name=NGM&gt;{{Cite journal |last =Klinkenborg | first =Verlyn | title =Splendor of the Grass: The Prairie's Grip is Unbroken in the Flint Hills of Kansas | journal =National Geographic | date =April 2007 | url = http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0704/feature5/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tree seedlings and intrusive [[alien species]] without fire tolerance are eliminated by periodic fires.  Such fires may either be set by humans (for example, Native Americans used fires to drive bison and improve hunting, travel, and visibility) or started naturally by lightning.

As its name suggests, the most obvious features of the tallgrass prairie are tall [[grass]]es, such as indiangrass (''[[Sorghastrum nutans]]''), big bluestem (''[[Andropogon gerardi]]''), little bluestem (''[[Schizachyrium scoparium]]''), and switchgrass (''[[Panicum virgatum]]''), which average between {{convert|1.5|and|2|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} tall, with occasional stalks as high as {{convert|2.5|to|3|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Prairies also include a large percentage of [[forb]]s, such as lead plant (''[[Amorpha]]'' spp.), prairie [[Silphium (genus)|rosinweed]] (''[[Silphium (genus)|Silphium]]'' spp.), gayfeathers (''[[Liatris]]'' spp.), [[sunflower]]s (''[[Helianthus]]'' spp.), asters (''[[Aster (genus)|Aster]]'' and ''[[Symphyotrichum]]'' spp.), [[coneflower]]s (''[[Echinacea]]'' spp., and ''[[Rudbeckia]]'' spp.), and many other species.

Technically, prairies have less than 5–11%{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} tree cover.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} A grass-dominated plant community with 10–49% tree cover is a [[savanna]].

After the steel [[plow]] was invented by [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]], this fertile soil became one of America's most important resources. Over 95% of the original tallgrass prairie is now [[farm]]land.

[[File:Pink and White Beauty (7368796606).jpg|thumb|A pink wild onion (''[[Allium stellatum]]'') — blooms in the tallgrass prairie of [[Waubay Wetland Management District]] in [[South Dakota]].]]

The tallgrass prairie survives in areas unsuited to plowing: the rocky hill country of the [[Flint Hills]], which runs north to south through east-central [[Kansas]]; the eastern fringe of the Red River Valley ([[Tallgrass Aspen Parkland]]) in [[Manitoba]] and Minnesota; the ''[[Coteau des Prairies]]'', which extends from [[South Dakota]] through [[Minnesota]] and into [[Iowa]]; and the far north portion of [[Oklahoma]].  In Oklahoma, the tallgrass prairie has been maintained by ranchers, who saw the hat-high grass as prime [[grazing]] area for [[cattle]].

The {{convert|158|km2|acre|order=flip|adj=on}} [[Tallgrass Prairie Preserve]] in [[Osage County, Oklahoma]], and the somewhat smaller {{convert|44.1|km2|acre|order=flip|adj=on}} [[Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve]] in Kansas, attempt to maintain this ecosystem in its natural form.  They have reintroduced [[plains bison]] to the vast expanses of grass.&lt;ref name=NGM/&gt;  Other U.S. preserves include [[Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie]] in Illinois, [[Loess Hills|Broken Kettle Preserve]] and [[Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge]] in Iowa, [[Konza Prairie]] in Kansas, and [[Prairie State Park]] in Missouri.  In eastern [[North Dakota]] is [[Sheyenne National Grassland]], the only [[United States National Grassland|national grassland]] on the tallgrass prairie.  Also, several small tallgrass prairie reservations are in [[Cook County]], [[Illinois]], including the [[National Natural Landmark]], [[Gensburg-Markham Prairie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Into the Wild: Indian Boundary Prairies |url=http://www.chicagowilderness.org/CW_Archives/issues/fall2008/itw_indianbnd.html |newspaper=Chicago Wilderness Magazine |date=Fall 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414112649/http://www.chicagowilderness.org/CW_Archives/issues/fall2008/itw_indianbnd.html |archivedate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original extent of tallgrass prairie in Canada was the {{convert|6000|km2|sqmi|order=flip|adj=on}} plain in the [[Red River Valley]], southwest of [[Winnipeg]] in Manitoba (''see'' map).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prairie Grasslands and Parkland |url=http://www.mb.ec.gc.ca/nature/whp/prgrass/df03s56.en.html |publisher=Environment Canada |date=22 August 2008  |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527125033/http://www.mb.ec.gc.ca/nature/whp/prgrass/df03s56.en.html |archivedate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While most of Manitoba's tallgrass prairie has been destroyed through cultivation and urban expansion, relatively small areas persist.  One of the largest blocks of remaining tallgrass prairie in Manitoba is protected by several conservation partners in a conservation area called the Tallgrass Aspen Parkland.  The [[Manitoba Tall Grass Prairie Preserve]], which occupies small portions of the rural municipalities of [[Rural Municipality of Stuartburn|Stuartburn]] and [[Rural Municipality of Franklin|Franklin]], forms a part of the Tallgrass Aspen Parkland. This preserve contains about {{convert|4000|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of tallgrass prairie, [[aspen parkland]], and wetlands.

A small pocket of less than {{convert|5|km2|acre|order=flip}} of tallgrass prairie remains in the southwest corner of [[Windsor, Ontario]], protected by [[Ojibway Park]], and Spring Garden Area of Natural Scientific Interest, along with the interconnected parks: [[Black Oak Heritage Park]], [[Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve]], and the [[Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park]].  Aside from the Provincial Nature Reserve, all are operated by the City of Windsor's Parks and Recreation.

==Restoration==
Considered the birthplace of [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]], the [[Restoration ecology#History of restoration ecology|first tallgrass prairie restoration]] was the 1936 Curtis Prairie at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum|University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum]].&lt;ref name="jordan2011"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/750183084|title=Making nature whole : a history of ecological restoration|last=Jordan, III|first=W. R.|date=2011|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781610910422|location=Washington, DC|oclc=750183084}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UW Arboretum was the center of tallgrass prairie research through the first half of the 20th century, with the development of the nearby Greene Prairie, [[Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm]] and pioneering techniques like [[Controlled burn|prescribed burning]].&lt;ref name="court2012"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/814694131|title=Pioneers of ecological restoration : the people and legacy of the University of Wisconsin Arboretum|last=Court|first=F. E.|date=2012|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299286630|location=Madison|oclc=814694131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter-half of the 20th century saw the growth of tallgrass prairie restoration beyond Wisconsin borders, with projects in Illinois such as at [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]], and [[Fermilab|Fermi National Laboratory]]. These major tallgrass restoration projects marked restorations growth from isolated studies to widespread practice. Tallgrass prairie restoration efforts picked up wider public recognition in the 1980s, spurred by the publication of a book of appreciation, [[John Madson]]'s ''Where the Sky Began: Land of the Tallgrass Prairie'' (1982).&lt;ref name="WTSB"&gt;{{cite book |last=Madson |first=John |date=1982 |title=Where the Sky Began: Land of the Tallgrass Prairie |url=https://www.uipress.uiowa.edu/books/2004-spring/madwhethe.htm |location=Boston, Mass. |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Company]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonprofit organizations throughout the former tallgrass prairie region began to reserve or restore small remnants of native prairie. For example, the Native Prairies Association of Texas was founded in 1986 to locate, restore, and protect prairies in Texas; the group currently protects about {{convert|2780|acre|km2}} of Texas prairies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasprairie.org/|title=Native Prairies Association of Texas|author=|date=|website=www.texasprairie.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie]], founded in 1996 near [[Elwood, Illinois]], was as of 2006 the largest tallgrass prairie restoration area in the United States.  In Minnesota, [[Glacial Ridge National Wildlife Refuge]] was established in 2004. The core of the refuge is a preserved {{convert|5000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} tallgrass prairie remnant, and an additional {{convert|30000|acre|km2|0}} are either in the process of restoration or will be soon.  According to [[The Nature Conservancy]], so far, 100 wetlands have been restored and {{convert|8000|acre|km2|0}} of land have been seeded with native plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/minnesota/preserves/art6943.html |title=The Nature Conservancy  - Glacial Ridge Project |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=November 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Trans-Caspian Oil Transport System''' is a proposed project to transport oil through the [[Caspian Sea]] from [[Kazakhstan]]i Caspian oilfields to [[Baku]] in [[Azerbaijan]] for the further transportation to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] or [[Black Sea]] coast. The main options under consideration are an offshore [[oil pipeline]] from Kazakhstan to Azerbaijan, and construction of [[oil terminal]]s and [[oil tanker]]s fleet.&lt;ref name=guliyev&gt;

The '''Tree of Life''' (''Shajarat-al-Hayat'') in [[Bahrain]] is a 9.75 meters (32 feet) high ''[[Prosopis cineraria]]'' tree that is over 400 years old. It is on a hill in a barren area of the [[Arabian Desert]], 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from [[Jebel Dukhan]], the highest point in Bahrain, and 40 kilometers from [[Manama]], the nearest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/bahrain/attractions/tree-of-life/a/poi-sig/1315762/361009 | title=Tree of Life | work=[[Lonely Planet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree is abundantly covered in green leaves. Due to its age and the fact that it is the only major tree growing in the area, the tree is a local tourist attraction and is visited by approximately 50,000 people every year. The yellow [[resin]] is used to make candles, aromatics and gum; the beans are processed into meal, jam, and wine.&lt;ref name=klm/&gt;

It is not certain how the tree survives. Bahrain has little to no rain throughout the year. Its roots are 50 meters deep which may be enough to reach the water source.&lt;ref name=klm&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.klm.com/destinations/bg/en/article/the-mysterious-tree-of-life | title=The mysterious Tree of Life | work=[[KLM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say the tree has learned to extract moisture from grains of sand. Some assert that the tree is protected by [[Enki]], a [[god of water]] in Babylonian and [[Sumerian religion]]. Others claim that the tree is standing in what was once the [[Garden of Eden]], and so has a more mystical source of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tree-of-life | title=Tree of Life | work=[[Atlas Obscura]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, archaeologists unearthed 500-year-old pottery and other artefacts in the vicinity of the tree.

The '''Tunguska event''' was a large [[explosion]] that occurred near the [[Stony Tunguska River]] in [[Yeniseysk Governorate]] (now [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]]), Russia, on the morning of 30 June 1908 ([[adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|NS]]).&lt;ref name=Farinella-2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=trayner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trayner|first1=C|year=1994|title=Perplexities of the Tunguska meteorite|bibcode=1994Obs...114..227T|journal=[[The Observatory (journal)|The Observatory]]|volume=114|pages=227–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion over the sparsely populated [[Eastern Siberian Taiga]] flattened {{convert|2000|sqkm||abbr=off}} of forest, yet caused no known human casualties. The explosion is generally attributed to the [[air burst]] of a [[Meteoroid#Meteors|meteor]]. It is classified as an [[impact event]], even though no [[impact crater]] has been found; the object is thought to have disintegrated at an altitude of {{convert|5|to|10|km|0|abbr=off}} rather than to have hit the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite APOD|date=14 November 2007|title=Tunguska: The Largest Recent Impact Event|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tunguska event is the largest impact event on [[Earth]] in recorded history. Studies have yielded different estimates of the meteoroid's size, on the order of {{convert|60|to|190|m|ft|abbr=off}}, depending on whether the body was a [[comet]] or a denser [[asteroid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Lyne|first1= J.

Since the 1908 event, there have been an estimated 1,000 scholarly papers (most in Russian) published on the Tunguska explosion. In 2013, a team of researchers published analysis results of micro-samples from a peat bog near the center of the affected area showing fragments that may be of meteoritic origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peplow|first=Mark|title=Rock samples suggest meteor caused Tunguska blast|work=Nature|date=10 June 2013|url=http://www.nature.com/news/rock-samples-suggest-meteor-caused-tunguska-blast-1.13163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kvasnytsya|first=Victor|author2=R.

Early estimates of the energy of the [[air burst]] range from {{convert|10|-|15|MtonTNT|lk=on|abbr=off}} to 30 megatons of TNT (130 PJ),&lt;ref name=shoe/&gt; depending on the exact height of burst estimated when the scaling-laws from the [[effects of nuclear weapons]] are employed.&lt;ref name=shoe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shoemaker|first=Eugene|author-link=Eugene Merle Shoemaker |title=Asteroid and Comet Bombardment of the Earth|publisher=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|year=1983|location=US Geological Survey, Flagstaff, Arizona|volume=11|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ea.11.050183.002333?prevSearch=Tunguska|issue=1|doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.11.050183.002333|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|pages=461–494|bibcode=1983AREPS..11..461S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandia National Laboratories"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/asteroid.html|title=Sandia supercomputers offer new explanation of Tunguska disaster|date=17 December 2007|publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]]|accessdate=22 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern supercomputer calculations that include the effect of the object's [[momentum]] find that more of the energy was focused downward than would be the case from a nuclear explosion and estimate that the airburst had an energy range from 3 to 5 megatons of TNT (13 to 21&amp;nbsp;PJ).&lt;ref name="Sandia National Laboratories"/&gt;

The 15-megaton ([[TNT equivalent|Mt]]) estimate represents an energy about 1,000 times greater than that of [[Little Boy|the atomic bomb]] [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Hiroshima]], Japan—roughly equal to that of the United States' [[Castle Bravo]] (15.2 Mt) ground-based thermonuclear detonation on 1 March 1954, and about one-third that of the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Tsar Bomba]] explosion on 30 October 1961 (which, at 50 Mt, is the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated).&lt;ref&gt;Verma (2005), p&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the Tunguska explosion knocked down some 80&amp;nbsp;million trees over an area of {{convert|2150|km2||abbr=on}}, and that the shock wave from the blast would have measured 5.0 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]. An explosion of this magnitude would be capable of destroying a large [[metropolitan area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|editor-last=Bobrowsky|editor-first=Peter T.|editor2-last=Rickman|editor2-first=Hans|title=Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society, An Interdisciplinary Approach|chapter=18: The Tunguska event|pages=303–330|publisher=Springer-Verlag|place=Berlin Heidelberg New York|publication-date=2007|url=http://www-th.bo.infn.it/tunguska/Asteroids-Chapter-18.pdf|isbn=978-3-540-32709-7|year=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014200044/http://www-th.bo.infn.it/tunguska/Asteroids-Chapter-18.pdf|archivedate=14 October 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, due to the remoteness of the location, no human fatalities were officially documented.

==Description==
[[File:Tunguska.png|right|thumb|Trees knocked over by the Tunguska blast. Photograph from the Soviet Academy of Science 1927 expedition led by [[Leonid Kulik]].]]

On 30 June 1908, at around 07:17 local time, [[Evenks|Evenki]] natives and Russian settlers in the hills north-west of [[Lake Baikal]] observed a column of bluish light, nearly as bright as the [[Sun]], moving across the sky. About ten minutes later, there was a flash and a sound similar to artillery fire. Eyewitnesses closer to the explosion reported that the source of the sound moved from the east to the north of them. The sounds were accompanied by a [[shock wave]] that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometres away. The majority of witnesses reported only the sounds and tremors, and did not report seeing the explosion. Eyewitness accounts vary regarding the sequence and duration of the events.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The explosion registered at [[seismology|seismic stations]] across [[Eurasia]], and air waves from the blast were detected in [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Croatia]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and as far away as [[Jakarta]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whipple|first=F.

{{Quote|At breakfast time I was sitting by the house at Vanavara Trading Post [''65 kilometres/40 miles south of the explosion''], facing north. […] I suddenly saw that directly to the north, over Onkoul's Tunguska Road, the sky split in two and fire appeared high and wide over the forest [''as Semenov showed, about 50 degrees up—expedition note'']. The split in the sky grew larger, and the entire northern side was covered with fire. At that moment I became so hot that I couldn't bear it as if my shirt was on fire; from the northern side, where the fire was, came strong heat. I wanted to tear off my shirt and throw it down, but then the sky shut closed, and a strong thump sounded, and I was thrown a few meters. I lost my senses for a moment, but then my wife ran out and led me to the house. After that such noise came, as if rocks were falling or cannons were firing, the Earth shook, and when I was on the ground, I pressed my head down, fearing rocks would smash it. When the sky opened up, hot wind raced between the houses, like from cannons, which left traces in the ground like pathways, and it damaged some crops. Later we saw that many windows were shattered, and in the barn, a part of the iron lock snapped.|sign=|source=}}

Testimony of Chuchan of Shanyagir tribe, as recorded by I. M. Suslov in 1926:&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev, Section 5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|We had a hut by the river with my brother Chekaren. We were sleeping. Suddenly we both woke up at the same time. Somebody shoved us. We heard whistling and felt strong wind. Chekaren said, 'Can you hear all those birds flying overhead?' We were both in the hut, couldn't see what was going on outside. Suddenly, I got shoved again, this time so hard I fell into the fire. I got scared. Chekaren got scared too. We started crying out for father, mother, brother, but no one answered. There was noise beyond the hut, we could hear trees falling down. Chekaren and I got out of our sleeping bags and wanted to run out, but then the thunder struck. This was the first thunder. The Earth began to move and rock, the wind hit our hut and knocked it over. My body was pushed down by sticks, but my head was in the clear. Then I saw a wonder: trees were falling, the branches were on fire, it became mighty bright, how can I say this, as if there was a second sun, my eyes were hurting, I even closed them. It was like what the Russians call lightning. And immediately there was a loud thunderclap. This was the second thunder. The morning was sunny, there were no clouds, our Sun was shining brightly as usual, and suddenly there came a second one!

Chekaren and I had some difficulty getting out from under the remains of our hut. Then we saw that above, but in a different place, there was another flash, and loud thunder came. This was the third thunder strike. Wind came again, knocked us off our feet, struck the fallen trees.

We looked at the fallen trees, watched the tree tops get snapped off, watched the fires. Suddenly Chekaren yelled "Look up" and pointed with his hand. I looked there and saw another flash, and it made another thunder. But the noise was less than before. This was the fourth strike, like normal thunder.

Now I remember well there was also one more thunder strike, but it was small, and somewhere far away, where the Sun goes to sleep.}}

''Sibir'' newspaper, 2 July 1908:&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev, Section 1, Item 2&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|On the morning of 17th of June,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregorian calendar]]: 30 June&lt;/ref&gt; around 9:00, we observed an unusual natural occurrence. In the north Karelinski village [200 verst ({{convert|213|km|mi|abbr=on}}) north of Kirensk] the peasants saw to the northwest, rather high above the horizon, some strangely bright (impossible to look at) bluish-white heavenly body, which for 10 minutes moved downwards. The body appeared as a "pipe", i.e., a cylinder. The sky was cloudless, only a small dark cloud was observed in the general direction of the bright body. It was hot and dry. As the body neared the ground (forest), the bright body seemed to smudge, and then turned into a giant billow of black smoke, and a loud knocking (not thunder) was heard as if large stones were falling, or artillery was fired. All buildings shook. At the same time the cloud began emitting flames of uncertain shapes. All villagers were stricken with panic and took to the streets, women cried, thinking it was the end of the world.

The author of these lines was meantime in the forest about 6 versts [6.4&amp;nbsp;km] north of Kirensk and heard to the north east some kind of artillery barrage, that repeated in intervals of 15 minutes at least 10 times. In Kirensk in a few buildings in the walls facing north-east window glass shook.}}

''Krasnoyaretz'' newspaper, 13 July 1908:&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev, Section 1, Item 5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Kezhemskoe village. On the 17th an unusual atmospheric event was observed. At 7:43 the noise akin to a strong wind was heard. Immediately afterward a horrific thump sounded, followed by an earthquake that literally shook the buildings as if they were hit by a large log or a heavy rock. The first thump was followed by a second, and then a third. Then the interval between the first and the third thumps was accompanied by an unusual underground rattle, similar to a railway upon which dozens of trains are traveling at the same time. Afterward, for 5 to 6 minutes an exact likeness of artillery fire was heard: 50 to 60 salvoes in short, equal intervals, which got progressively weaker. After 1.5–2 minutes after one of the "barrages" six more thumps were heard, like cannon firing, but individual, loud and accompanied by tremors.

The sky, at the first sight, appeared to be clear. There was no wind and no clouds. Upon closer inspection to the north, i.e. where most of the thumps were heard, a kind of an ashen cloud was seen near the horizon, which kept getting smaller and more transparent and possibly by around 2–3 p.m. completely disappeared.}}

==Investigations==
{{more citations needed|date=December 2017}}{{original research|date=December 2017}}
The first recorded expedition arrived at the scene more than a decade after the event. In 1921, the Russian [[mineralogy|mineralogist]] [[Leonid Kulik]], visiting the Podkamennaya Tunguska River basin as part of a survey for the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]], deduced from local accounts that the explosion had been caused by a giant [[impact event|meteorite impact]]. He persuaded the Soviet government to fund an expedition to the Tunguska region, based on the prospect of [[meteoric iron]] that could be salvaged to aid Soviet industry. Kulik's party eventually undertook an expedition in 1927.

[[File:Tunguska event fallen trees.jpg|left|thumb|Photograph from Kulik's 1929 expedition taken near the Hushmo River]]
Upon arrival, Kulik made arrangements with the local [[Evenks|Evenki]] hunters to guide his party to the impact site. Reaching the explosion site was an extremely arduous task. Upon reaching an area just south of the site, the superstitious Evenki hunters would go no farther, fearing what they called the Valleymen.{{Citation needed|reason=The Valleymen appear to have been invented out of whole cloth in a July 2009 edit to this article|date=December 2017}} Kulik had to return to the nearby village, and his party was delayed for several days while they sought new guides.

The spectacle that confronted Kulik as he stood on a ridge overlooking the devastated area was overwhelming. To the explorers' surprise, they found no [[impact crater|crater]]. There was instead around [[ground zero]] a zone {{convert|8|km|abbr=off}} across of trees scorched and devoid of branches, but standing upright. The trees farther away had been partly scorched and knocked down in a direction away from the centre. Much later, in the 1960s, it was established that the zone of levelled forest occupied an area of {{convert|2150|km2|abbr=on}}, its shape resembling a gigantic spread-eagled butterfly with a "wingspan" of {{convert|70|km||abbr=on}} and a "body length" of {{convert|55|km||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Boyarkina, A. P., Demin, D. V., Zotkin, I. T., Fast, W. G. "Estimation of the blast wave of the Tunguska meteorite from the forest destruction". ''Meteoritika'', Vol. 24, 1964, pp.&amp;nbsp;112–128 (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; Upon closer examination, Kulik located holes that he erroneously concluded were meteorite holes; he did not have the means at that time to excavate the holes.

During the next ten years there were three more expeditions to the area. Kulik found several dozens of little "pothole" bogs, each some {{convert|10|to|50|m|abbr=off}} in diameter, that he thought might be meteoric craters. After a laborious exercise in draining one of these [[bog]]s (the so-called "Suslov's crater", {{convert|32|m|abbr=on}} in diameter), he found an old [[tree stump|stump]] on the bottom, ruling out the possibility that it was a meteoric crater. In 1938, Kulik arranged for an aerial photographic survey of the area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-th.bo.infn.it/tunguska/APS-photolist.htm|author=Longo G.|title=The 1938 aerophotosurvey|accessdate=8 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; covering the central part of the levelled forest ({{convert|250|km2}}).&lt;ref name=Bronshten2000&gt;See: Bronshten (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;56.&lt;/ref&gt; The negatives of these aerial photographs (1,500 negatives, each {{convert|18|by|18|cm|abbr=off}}) were burned in 1975 by order of [[Yevgeny Krinov]], then Chairman of the Committee on Meteorites of the USSR Academy of Sciences, as part of an initiative to dispose of hazardous [[celluloid|nitrate film]].&lt;ref name=Bronshten2000/&gt; Positive prints were preserved for further study in the Russian city of [[Tomsk]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubtsov (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Expeditions sent to the area in the 1950s and 1960s found microscopic [[silicate]] and [[magnetite]] spheres in siftings of the soil. Similar spheres were predicted to exist in the felled trees, although they could not be detected by contemporary means. Later expeditions did identify such spheres in the resin of the trees. [[Chemical analysis]] showed that the spheres contained high proportions of [[nickel]] relative to iron, which is also found in [[meteorite]]s, leading to the conclusion they were of extraterrestrial origin. The concentration of the spheres in different regions of the soil was also found to be consistent with the expected distribution of debris from a meteoroid [[air burst]].&lt;ref name=Florenskiy/&gt; Later studies of the spheres found unusual ratios of numerous other metals relative to the surrounding environment, which was taken as further evidence of their extraterrestrial origin.&lt;ref name=anomalies&gt;Kolesnikov ''et al.'' "Finding of probable Tunguska Cosmic Body material: isotopic anomalies of carbon and hydrogen in peat", ''[[Planetary and Space Science]]'', Volume 47, Issues 6–7, 1 June 1999, Pages 905–916.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical analysis of [[peat bog]]s from the area also revealed numerous anomalies considered consistent with an impact event. The [[isotopic signature]]s of stable carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen isotopes at the layer of the bogs corresponding to 1908 were found to be inconsistent with the isotopic ratios measured in the adjacent layers, and this abnormality was not found in bogs located outside the area. The region of the bogs showing these anomalous signatures also contains an unusually high proportion of [[iridium]], similar to the iridium layer found in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]]. These unusual proportions are believed to result from debris from the falling body that deposited in the bogs. The nitrogen is believed to have been deposited as [[acid rain]], a suspected fallout from the explosion.&lt;ref name=anomalies/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hou ''et al.''

Researcher John Anfinogenov has suggested that a boulder found at the event site, known as John's stone, is a remnant of the meteorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anfinogenov|first1=John et al.|title=John's Stone: A possible fragment of the 1908 Tunguska meteorite|journal=Icarus|publisher=Elsevier|date=15 November 2014|volume=245|pages=139–147|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103514004680|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2014.09.006|bibcode=2014Icar..243..139A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earth impactor model==
===Asteroid air burst===
The leading scientific explanation for the explosion is the [[air burst]] of an [[asteroid]] {{convert|6|–|10|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} above Earth's surface.

Meteoroids enter [[Earth's atmosphere]] from [[outer space]] every day, travelling at a speed of at least {{convert|11|km/s|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. The heat generated by compression of air in front of the body ([[ram pressure]]) as it travels through the atmosphere is immense and most meteoroids burn up or explode before they reach the ground. Since the second half of the 20th century, close monitoring of Earth's atmosphere has led to the discovery that such asteroid air bursts occur rather frequently. A stony asteroid of about {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter can produce an explosion of around 20 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons]], similar to that of the [[Fat Man]] bomb dropped on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], and data released by the US Air Force's [[Defense Support Program]] indicate that such explosions occur high in the [[upper atmosphere]] more than once a year. Tunguska-like [[TNT equivalent|megaton-range]] events are much rarer. [[Eugene Merle Shoemaker|Eugene Shoemaker]] estimated that such events occur about once every 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/phenom_jan95.html?c=y&amp;page=2|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910221113/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/phenom_jan95.html?c=y&amp;page=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-09-10|title=Phenomena, Comment &amp; Notes|first=John P., Jr.|last=Wiley|date=January 1995|work=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc021097.html Subject: "Three Minutes to Impact"], To: Cambridge-Conference@..., Date sent: Mon, 10 February 1997 23:04:24 -0600 (CST), From: pib@...&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blast patterns===
The explosion's effect on the trees near the hypocentre of the explosion was replicated during [[nuclear testing|atmospheric nuclear tests]] in the 1950s and 1960s,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}{{Discuss}} and was similar to the effects of the conventional [[Operation Blowdown]]. These effects are caused by the [[blast wave]] produced by large airburst explosions. The trees directly below the explosion are stripped as the blast wave moves vertically downward, while trees farther away are knocked over because the blast wave is travelling closer to horizontal when it reaches them.

Soviet experiments performed in the mid-1960s, with model forests (made of [[match]]es on wire stakes) and small explosive charges slid downward on wires, produced butterfly-shaped blast patterns strikingly similar to the pattern found at the Tunguska site. The experiments suggested that the object had approached at an angle of roughly 30 degrees from the ground and 115 degrees from north and had exploded in mid-air.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1156463|title=Siberian Apocalypse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asteroid or comet===
In 1930, the British astronomer [[Francis John Welsh Whipple|F. J. W. Whipple]] suggested that the Tunguska body was a small [[comet]]. A comet is composed of [[cosmic dust|dust]] and [[volatiles]], such as water ice and frozen gases, and could have been completely [[vaporization|vaporised]] by the impact with Earth's atmosphere, leaving no obvious traces. The comet hypothesis was further supported by the glowing skies (or "skyglows" or "bright nights") observed across Europe for several evenings after the impact, possibly explained by dust and ice that had been dispersed from the [[comet's tail]] across the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name=shoe/&gt; The cometary hypothesis gained a general acceptance amongst Soviet Tunguska investigators by the 1960s.&lt;ref name=shoe/&gt;

In 1978, Slovak astronomer [[Ľubor Kresák]] suggested that the body was a fragment of [[Comet Encke]]. This is a [[periodic comet]] with an extremely short period of 3 years that stays entirely within the orbit of Jupiter. It is also responsible for the [[Beta Taurids]], an annual [[meteor shower]] with a maximum activity around 28–29 June. The Tunguska event coincided with the peak activity of that shower,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Tunguska object—A fragment of Comet Encke|journal=[[Astronomical Institutes of Czechoslovakia]] |volume=29|issue=3|year=1978|bibcode=1978BAICz..29..129K}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the approximate trajectory of the Tunguska object is consistent with what would be expected from a fragment of Comet Encke.&lt;ref name=shoe/&gt; It is now known that bodies of this kind explode at frequent intervals tens to hundreds of kilometres above the ground. Military satellites have been observing these explosions for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nemtchinov|first=I.V.|first2=C.|last2=Jacobs|first3=E.|last3=Tagliaferri|title=Analysis of Satellite Observations of Large Meteoroid Impacts|journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]]|volume=822|issue=1 Near–Earth Ob|pages=303–317|year=1997|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48348.x|bibcode=1997NYASA.822..303N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, astronomer [[Zdeněk Sekanina]] published a paper criticising the comet hypothesis. He pointed out that a body composed of cometary material, travelling through the atmosphere along such a shallow trajectory, ought to have disintegrated, whereas the Tunguska body apparently remained intact into the lower atmosphere. Sekanina argued that the evidence pointed to a dense, rocky object, probably of [[asteroid]]al origin. This hypothesis was further boosted in 2001, when Farinella, Foschini, ''et al.'' released a study calculating the probabilities based on orbital modelling extracted from the atmospheric trajectories of the Tunguska object. They concluded with a probability of 83% that the object moved on an asteroidal path originating from the [[asteroid belt]], rather than on a cometary one (probability of 17%).&lt;ref name=Farinella-2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farinella|first1=Paolo|last2=Foschini|first2=L.|last3=Froeschlé|first3=Christiane|last4=Gonczi|first4=R.|last5=Jopek|first5=T.

Proponents of the comet hypothesis have suggested that the object was an [[extinct comet]] with a stony mantle that allowed it to penetrate the atmosphere.

The chief difficulty in the asteroid hypothesis is that a stony object should have produced a large [[impact crater|crater]] where it struck the ground, but no such crater has been found. It has been hypothesised that the passage of the asteroid through the atmosphere caused pressures and temperatures to build up to a point where the asteroid abruptly disintegrated in a huge explosion. The destruction would have to have been so complete that no remnants of substantial size survived, and the material scattered into the upper atmosphere during the explosion would have caused the skyglows. Models published in 1993 suggested that the stony body would have been about {{convert|60|m}} across, with physical properties somewhere between an ordinary [[chondrite]] and a [[carbonaceous chondrite]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Typical carbonaceous chondrite substance tends to be dissolved with water rather quickly unless it is frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arctic Asteroid!|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast01jun_1m|website=Science at NASA|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Chyba]] and others have proposed a process whereby a stony meteorite could have exhibited the behaviour of the Tunguska impactor. Their models show that when the forces opposing a body's descent become greater than the cohesive force holding it together, it blows apart, releasing nearly all its energy at once. The result is no crater, with damage distributed over a fairly wide radius, and all of the damage resulting from the thermal energy released in the blast.

Three-dimensional numerical modelling of the Tunguska impact done by Utyuzhnikov and Rudenko in 2008&lt;ref name=2008URpdf&gt;Utyuzhnikov, S. V. and Rudenko, D. V. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110929135810/http://journals.pepublishing.com/content/t7n295w46t842231/fulltext.pdf "An adaptive moving mesh method with application to nontstationary hypersonic flows in the atmosphere"] ''[[Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]'', [[Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering|Part G]], ''Journal of Aerospace Engineering'', 2008, 222 (5): 661–671&lt;/ref&gt; supports the comet hypothesis. According to their results, the comet matter dispersed in the atmosphere, while the destruction of the forest was caused by the shock wave.

During the 1990s, Italian researchers, coordinated by the physicist Giuseppe Longo from [[University of Bologna]], extracted [[resin]] from the core of the trees in the area of impact to examine trapped particles that were present during the 1908 event. They found high levels of material commonly found in rocky asteroids and rarely found in comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Longo |first=G. |last2=Serra |first2=R. |last3=Cecchini |first3=S. |last4=Galli |first4=M. |title=Search for microremnants of the Tunguska Cosmic Body |journal=[[Planetary and Space Science]] |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=163–177 |publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd |location=UK |year=1994 |url=http://www-th.bo.infn.it/tunguska/papers/planetspace.html |doi=10.1016/0032-0633(94)90028-0|bibcode= 1994P&amp;SS...42..163L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Serra|first=R. |last2=Cecchini|first2=S. |last3=Galli|first3=M. |last4= Longo |first4= G. |title=Experimental hints on the fragmentation of the Tunguska cosmic body |journal=Planetary and Space Science |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=777–783 |publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd |location=UK |year=1994 |url=http://www-th.bo.infn.it/tunguska/papers/pss2.html |doi=10.1016/0032-0633(94)90120-1|bibcode= 1994P&amp;SS...42..777S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly ''et al.'' (2009) contend that the impact was caused by a comet because of the sightings of [[noctilucent clouds]] following the impact, a phenomenon caused by massive amounts of water vapor in the upper atmosphere. They compared the noctilucent cloud phenomenon to the exhaust plume from NASA's [[space shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'' space shuttle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Two-dimensional turbulence, space shuttle plume transport in the thermosphere, and a possible relation to the Great Siberian Impact Event|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|date=22 June 2009|type=Published online 22 July 2009|first=M.C.|last=Kelly|author2=C.

In 2010, an expedition led by Vladimir Alexeev with scientists from the Troitsk Innovation and Nuclear Research Institute ([[TRINITY]]) used ground penetrating radar to examine the Suslov crater at the Tunguska site. What they found was that the crater was created by the violent impact of a celestial body. The layers of the crater consisted of modern permafrost on top, older damaged layers underneath, and finally, deep below, fragments of the celestial body were discovered. Preliminary analysis showed that it was a huge piece of ice that shattered on impact, which seem to support the theory that a comet caused the cataclysm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://english.pravda.ru/science/mysteries/25-10-2010/115495-tunguska_meteorite-0/ |title=Mystery of Tunguska meteorite solved |work=[[Pravda]]|date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in 2013, analysis of fragments from the Tunguska site by a joint US-European team was consistent with an iron meteorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2013/07/01/meteoroid-not-comet-explains-the-1908-tunguska-fireball/ |title= Meteoroid, not comet, explains the 1908 Tunguska fireball |website= DiscoverMagazine.com'' blog |date= 1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lake Cheko===
{{See also|Lake Cheko}}
In June 2007, scientists from the [[University of Bologna]] identified a lake in the Tunguska region as a possible impact crater from the event. They do not dispute that the Tunguska body exploded in mid-air but believe that a ten-metre fragment survived the explosion and struck the ground. [[Lake Cheko]] is a small, bowl-shaped lake approximately {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} north-northwest of the hypocentre.&lt;ref name=italy2&gt;{{cite journal|title=A possible impact crater for the 1908 Tunguska Event|journal=Department of Physics|publisher=[[University of Bologna]]|volume=19|issue=4|page=245|year=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3121.2007.00742.x|bibcode=2007TeNov..19..245G|last1=Gasperini|first1=L|last2=Alvisi|first2=F|last3=Biasini|first3=G|last4=Bonatti|first4=E|last5=Longo|first5=G|last6=Pipan|first6=M|last7=Ravaioli|first7=M|last8=Serra|first8=R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis has been disputed by other impact crater specialists.&lt;ref name=rincon1&gt;{{cite news|first=Rincon|last=Paul|date=27 June 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6239334.stm|title=Team makes Tunguska crater claim |publisher= BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1961 investigation had dismissed a modern origin of Lake Cheko, saying that the presence of metres-thick [[silt]] deposits at the lake's bed suggests an age of at least 5,000 years,&lt;ref name=Florenskiy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Florenskiy|first=K P|authorlink=Kirill Florensky|title=Preliminary results from the 1961 combined Tunguska meteorite expedition|journal=Meteoritica|volume=23|year=1963|url=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/tungmet.html|accessdate=26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more recent research suggests that only a metre or so of the sediment layer on the lake bed is "normal lacustrine sedimentation", a depth consistent with an age of about 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gasperini|first=L.|title=Reply—Lake Cheko and the Tunguska Event: impact or non-impact?|journal=Terra Nova|volume=20|issue=2|pages=169–172|date=April 2008|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3121.2008.00792.x|last2=Bonatti|first2=Enrico|last3=Longo|first3=Giuseppe|bibcode=2008TeNov..20..169G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acoustic-echo soundings of the lake floor provide support for the hypothesis that the lake was formed by the Tunguska event.

The main points of the study are that
{{Quote|Cheko, a small lake located in Siberia close to the hypocentre of the 1908 Tunguska explosion, might fill a crater left by the impact of a fragment of a cosmic body. Sediment cores from the lake's bottom were studied to support or reject this hypothesis.

Pollen analysis reveals that remains of aquatic plants are abundant in the top post-1908 sequence but are absent in the lower pre-1908 portion of the core. These results, including organic C, N and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C data, suggest that Lake Cheko formed at the time of the Tunguska event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Luca|last1= Gasperini |first2=Enrico|last2=Bonatti|first3=Sonia|last3= Albertazzi|first4=Luisa|last4=Forlani|first5=Carla A.|last5=Accorsi|first6=Giuseppe|last6=Longo|first7=Mariangela|last7=Ravaioli|first8=Francesca|last8=Alvisi|first9=Alina|last9=Polonia |first10=Fabio|last10=Sacchetti|title=Sediments from Lake Cheko (Siberia), a possible impact crater for the 1908 Tunguska Event|work=Terra Nova|volume=21|number=6|pages=489–494|date=December 2009|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3121.2009.00906.x|bibcode=2009TeNov..21..489G}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In 2017, however, new research by Russian scientists points to a rejection of the theory.

==Geophysical hypotheses==
The scientific consensus is that the explosion was caused by the impact of a small asteroid; however, there are some dissenters. Astrophysicist Wolfgang Kundt has proposed that the Tunguska event was caused by the release and subsequent explosion of 10 million tons of natural gas from within Earth's crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kundt|first=W.|year=2001|title=The 1908 Tunguska catastrophe|url=http://tejas.serc.iisc.ernet.in/~currsci/aug252001/399.pdf|journal=[[Current Science]]|volume=81|pages=399–407|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075707/http://tejas.serc.iisc.ernet.in/~currsci/aug252001/399.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=N.|last=Jones|title=Did blast from below destroy Tunguska?|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=7 September 2002|volume=2359|page=14|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17523591.900-did-blast-from-below-destroy-tunguska.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W.|last=Kundt|contribution= Tunguska (1908) and its relevance for comet/asteroid impact statistics|title=Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society|editor1-first= P.

Retrieved 8 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea is that natural gas leaked out of the crust and then rose to its equal-density height in the atmosphere; from there, it drifted downwind, in a sort of wick, which eventually found an ignition source such as lightning. Once the gas was ignited, the fire streaked along the wick, and then down to the source of the leak in the ground, whereupon there was the explosion.

The Tunguska event is not the only example of a great unobserved explosion event. For example, the [[1930 Curuçá River event]] in Brazil was an explosion of a [[superbolide]] that left no clear evidence of an impact crater. Modern developments in [[infrasound]] detection by the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] and infrared [[DSP satellite]] technology have reduced the likelihood of undetected airbursts.

A [[Chelyabinsk meteor|smaller air burst]] occurred over a populated area in Russia on 15 February 2013, at [[Chelyabinsk]] in the Ural district of Russia. The exploding meteoroid was an asteroid that measured about 17 to 20 metres across, with an estimated initial mass of 11,000 tonnes, and inflicted over 1,200 injuries, mainly from broken glass falling from windows shattered by its shock wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-meteorite/meteorite-hits-central-russia-more-than-500-people-hurt-idUSLNE91E00G20130215|title=Meteorite hits central Russia, more than 500 people hurt|first1=Natalia|last1=Shurmina|first2=Andrey|last2=Kuzmin|agency=Reuters|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second '''USS ''Porpoise''''' was a 224-ton ''Dolphin'' class brigantine. (In early American usage, a brigantine was referred to as a hermaphrodite brig.) The USS ''Porpoise'' was later rerigged as a brig (see illustration at right). She was based on the same plans as {{USS|Dolphin|1836|2}}.

''Porpoise'' was authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]] on 30 June 1834; built in 1835; and launched 31 May 1836; [[Lieutenant]] [[William Ramsay]] in command.

''Porpoise'' sailed from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] on 25 August 1836, called at various southern ports, and conducted coastal surveying operations under the direction of Lt. [[Charles Wilkes]] in the summer of 1837. In October 1837, she hunted [[Piracy|pirate]]s along the southern coast, and then resumed her survey work in December.

''Porpoise'', Lt. [[Cadwalader Ringgold]] in command, was then assigned to the squadron which Wilkes was to command on an extended exploratory expedition around the world. She stood out of [[Hampton Roads]] on 18 August 1838 with the [[United States Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842|United States Exploring Expedition Squadron]]. She assisted in the exploration and survey work of the Expedition as it confirmed the existence of the [[Antarctic]] Continent, charted vast areas of the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], circumnavigated the world, and returned to [[New York City|New York]] four years later.

''Porpoise'' underwent overhaul at New York at the end of 1842 and sailed on 8 February 1843 for the west coast of [[Africa]] to join the squadron patrolling for slavers. She returned to New York on 19 November 1844.

From February 1845-July 1847, ''Porpoise'' cruised in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], participating in the Naval operations against [[Tampico, Tamaulipas|Tampico]], [[Pánuco, Veracruz|Pánuco]], and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] during the War with Mexico. Upon return to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], she remained decommissioned until 1 January 1848.

During the next three and a half years, she hunted slavers along the west coast of Africa, touching at the U.S. in the spring of 1850. Returning to New York from this extended cruise on 19 December 1851. She again decommissioned on 3 August 1852.

Recommissioned in May 1853, she was assigned to [[North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition]] under Commander Cadwalader Ringgold, a veteran, like ''Porpoise'', of the [[United States Exploring Expedition|Wilkes Expedition]]. She joined the squadron at Hampton Roads, and with it, stood out to sea on 11 June 1853. ''Porpoise'' rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and with the squadron explored and charted many Pacific islands and shoals before arriving in [[China]] in March 1854. The squadron put to sea once more to explore in the [[Bonin Islands|Bonins]], the [[Mariana Islands|Ladrones]], and the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]]. ''Porpoise'' parted company with the other vessels on 21 September 1854 between [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and China, and was never heard from again. It is supposed that she foundered in a heavy typhoon which occurred a few days after her separation from the squadron.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26192">{{short description|A cosmic ray particle with a kinetic energy greater than 1×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; eV}}
In [[astroparticle physics]], an '''ultra-high-energy cosmic ray''' ('''UHECR''') is a [[cosmic ray]] particle with a [[kinetic energy]] greater than {{val|1|e=18}} [[electronvolt|eV]], far beyond both the [[rest mass]] and energies typical of other cosmic ray particles.

An '''extreme-energy cosmic ray''' ('''EECR''') is an UHECR with energy exceeding {{val|5|e=19|u=eV}}  (about 8&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]), the so-called  [[Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit]] (GZK limit).  This limit should be the maximum energy of cosmic ray protons that have traveled long distances (about 160 million light years), since higher-energy protons would have lost energy over that distance due to scattering from photons in the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). It follows that EECR could not be survivors from the [[early universe]], but are cosmologically "young", emitted somewhere in the [[Local Supercluster]] by some unknown physical process. If an EECR is not a proton, but a nucleus with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; nucleons, then the GZK limit applies to its nucleons, which carry only a fraction &lt;math&gt;1/A&lt;/math&gt; of the total energy of the nucleus. For an iron nucleus, the corresponding limit would be {{val|2.8|e=21|u=eV}}.

These particles are extremely rare; between 2004 and 2007, the initial runs of the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] (PAO) detected 27 events with estimated arrival energies above {{val|5.7|e=19|u=eV}}, i.e., about one such event every four weeks in the 3000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area surveyed by the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;

The postulated (hypothetical) sources of EECR are known as '''Zevatrons''', named in analogy to [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]'s [[Bevatron]] and [[Fermilab]]'s [[Tevatron]], and therefore capable of accelerating particles to 1 ZeV (10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; eV, zetta-electronvolt).  In 2004 there was a consideration of the possibility of [[galactic jet]]s acting as Zevatrons, due to diffusive acceleration of particles caused by shock waves inside the jets. In particular, models suggested that shock waves from the nearby [[Elliptical galaxy M87|M87]] [[galactic jet]] could accelerate an iron nucleus to ZeV ranges.&lt;ref&gt;

Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 445, Issue 4, p.4155-4160]&lt;/ref&gt; in the magnetospheres of [[Active galactic nucleus|AGN]]. Although newer results indicate that fewer than 40% of these cosmic rays seemed to be coming from the AGN, a much weaker correlation than previously reported.&lt;ref name="Cosmic-ray theory unravels"/&gt; A more speculative suggestion by Grib and Pavlov (2007, 2008) envisages the decay of superheavy [[dark matter]]&amp;nbsp;by means of the [[Penrose process]].

==Observational history==
{{See also|Cosmic ray observatory}}
{{Main|Oh-My-God particle}}
The first observation of a cosmic ray particle with an energy exceeding {{val|1.0|e=20|u=eV}} (16&amp;nbsp;J) was made by Dr [[John Linsley|John D Linsley]] and Livio Scarsi at the [[Volcano Ranch experiment]] in New Mexico in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;

Cosmic ray particles with even higher energies have since been observed. Among them was the [[Oh-My-God particle]] observed by the University of Utah's Fly's Eye experiment on the evening of 15 October 1991 over [[Dugway Proving Ground]], Utah. Its observation was a shock to [[astrophysics|astrophysicists]], who estimated its energy to be approximately {{val|3|e=20|u=eV}} (50&amp;nbsp;J)&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;in other words, an [[atomic nucleus]] with kinetic energy equal to that of a [[baseball (object)|baseball]] ({{convert|5|oz|g|0|disp=or|sp=us}}) traveling at about {{convert|100|km/h|mph|-1|sp=us}}.

The energy of this particle is some 40 million times that of the highest energy protons that have been produced in any terrestrial [[particle accelerator]]. However, only a small fraction of this energy would be available for an interaction with a proton or neutron on Earth, with most of the energy remaining in the form of kinetic energy of the products of the interaction (see [[Collider#Explanation]]). The effective energy available for such a collision is the square root of double the product of the particle's energy and the mass energy of the proton, which for this particle gives {{val|7.5|e=14|u=eV}}, roughly 50 times the collision energy of the [[Large Hadron Collider]].

Since the first observation, by the [[University of Utah]]'s [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector]], at least fifteen similar events have been recorded, confirming the phenomenon. These very high energy cosmic ray particles are very rare; the energy of most cosmic ray particles is between 10&amp;nbsp;MeV and 10&amp;nbsp;GeV.

===Pierre Auger Observatory===
{{Main|Pierre Auger Observatory}}
Pierre Auger Observatory is an international cosmic ray observatory designed to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic ray particles (with energies beyond 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; eV). These high-energy particles have an estimated arrival rate of just 1 per square kilometer per century, therefore, in order to record a large number of these events, the Auger Observatory has created a detection area of 3,000&amp;nbsp;km² (the size of [[Rhode Island]], USA) in [[Mendoza Province]], western [[Argentina]].
A larger cosmic-ray detector array is also planned for the northern hemisphere as part of the Pierre Auger complex.
The Pierre Auger Observatory, in addition to obtaining directional information from the cluster of water tanks used to observe the cosmic-ray-shower components, also has four telescopes trained on the night sky to observe [[fluorescence]] of the [[nitrogen]] molecules as the shower particles traverse the sky, giving further directional information on the original cosmic ray particle.

In September 2017, data from 12 years of observations from PAO supported an extragalactic source (e.g. outside of Earth's galaxy) for the origin of extremely high energy cosmic rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-09/uon-scc091517.php|title=Study confirms cosmic rays have extragalactic origins|website=EurekAlert!|language=en|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suggested explanations==

===Neutron stars===
One suggested source of UHECR particles is their origination from [[neutron star]]s.  In young neutron stars with spin periods of &lt;10ms, the [[Magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) forces]] from the quasi-neutral fluid of superconducting protons and electrons existing in a neutron [[superfluid]] accelerate iron nuclei to UHECR velocities.  The magnetic field produced by the neutron superfluid in rapidly rotating stars creates a magnetic field of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; tesla, at which point the neutron star is classified as a [[magnetar]].  This magnetic field is the strongest in the observed universe and creates the relativistic MHD wind believed to accelerate iron nuclei remaining from the supernova to the necessary energy.

Another hypothesized source of UHECRs from neutron stars is during neutron star to [[strange star]] combustion.  This hypothesis relies on the assumption that [[strange matter]] is the [[ground state]] of matter which has no experimental or observational data to support it.  Due to the immense gravitational pressures from the neutron star, it is believed that small pockets of matter consisting of ''up'', ''down'', and ''strange'' quarks in equilibrium acting as a single hadron (as opposed to a number of [[Sigma baryon|{{SubatomicParticle|Sigma0}} baryons]]).  This will then combust the entire star to strange matter, at which point the neutron star becomes a strange star and its magnetic field breaks down, which occurs because the protons and neutrons in the quasi-neutral fluid have become [[strangelets]].  This magnetic field breakdown releases large amplitude electromagnetic waves (LAEMWs).  The LAEMWs accelerate light ion remnants from the supernova to UHECR energies.

Very high energy cosmic ray electrons might be explained by the [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]] in the magnetospheres of the [[Crab Nebula#Crab Pulsar|Crab]]-like [[Pulsar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130212/srep01262/full/srep01262.html Mahajan Swadesh, Machabeli George, Osmanov Zaza &amp; Chkheidze Nino. Nature Scientific Reports, Volume 3, id. 1262 (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active galactic cores===
Interactions with [[blue shift|blue-shifted]] [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] limit the distance that these particles can travel before losing energy; this is known as the [[Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit]] or GZK limit.

The source of such high energy particles has been a mystery for many years. Recent results from the Pierre Auger Observatory show that ultra-high-energy cosmic ray arrival directions appear to be correlated with extragalactic supermassive black holes at the center of nearby galaxies called [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei (AGN)]].&lt;ref name="PAO2007"/&gt;
However, since the angular correlation scale used is fairly large (3.1 degrees) these results do not unambiguously identify the origins of such cosmic ray particles. The AGN could merely be closely associated with the actual sources, for example in galaxies or other astrophysical objects that are clumped with matter on large scales within 100 [[megaparsec|Mpc]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Some of the [[supermassive black hole]]s in AGN are known to be rotating, as in the [[Seyfert galaxy]] MCG 6-30-15&lt;ref&gt;

===Relation with dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
It is hypothesized that active galactic nuclei are capable of converting dark matter into high energy protons. Yuri Pavlov and Andrey Grib at the Alexander Friedmann Laboratory for Theoretical Physics at St. Petersburg hypothesize that dark matter particles are about 15 times heavier than protons, and that they can decay into pairs of heavier virtual particles of a type that interacts with ordinary matter.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near an active galactic nucleus, one of these particles can fall into the black hole, while the other escapes, as described by the [[Penrose process]]. Some of those particles will collide with incoming particles; these are very high energy collisions which, according to Pavlov, can form ordinary visible protons with very high energy. Pavlov then claims that evidence of such processes are ultra-high-energy cosmic ray particles.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such very energetic decay products, carrying a fraction of the mass of the X particle, are believed to be a plausible explanation for the observed ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR).
 
High energy cosmic ray particles traversing intergalactic space suffer the [[GZK cutoff]] above 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; eV due to interactions with cosmic background radiation if the primary cosmic ray particles are protons or nuclei. The [[Pierre Auger Observatory|Pierre Auger Project]], [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|HiRes]] and [[Yakutsk Extensive Air Shower Array]] found the GZK cutoff, while Akeno-[[AGASA]] observed the events above the cutoff (11 events in the past 10 years). The result of the Akeno-AGASA experiment is smooth near the GZK cutoff energy. If one assumes that the Akeno-AGASA result is correct and consider its implication, a possible explanation for the AGASA data on GZK cutoff violation would be a shower caused by dark matter particles. A dark matter particle is not constrained by the GZK cutoff, since it interacts weakly with cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements by the Pierre Auger Project have found a correlation between the direction of high energy cosmic ray particles and the location of AGN.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Vitaly Valentinovich Bianki''' ({{lang-ru|Вита́лий Валенти́нович Биа́нки}})  (11 February 1894, [[St. Petersburg]] — 10 June 1959, [[Leningrad]]) — was a popular Russian children’s writer and a prolific author of books on nature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XqaTzQBVDCAC&amp;pg=PA761&amp;dq=%22Vitaly+Bianki%22 International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bianki's father was [[Valentin Lvovich Bianchi]] (1857-1920), an [[entomologist]] and curator at the Zoological Museum of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. His three sons were at home in its halls. On a summer vacation Vitaly Bianchi went on his first forestry trip, and became a passionate outdoorsman. He graduated from the Natural Science Department of the Physical and Mathematical Faculty of [[Petrograd University]] in 1916 with a specialization in ornithology, as well as studies in art at the St. Petersburg Art Institute to assist with the drawing of plants and animals.

Bianchi served in the army in 1916 and joined the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] in 1917. In 1917 moved to [[Biysk]], where he was forced into the [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Kolchak]] army. He deserted and lived under a false name "Vitaly Belyanin" until the eventual expulsion of the Kolchak regime. His double name Bianki-Belyanin remained on his passport until the end of his life. He worked for the Commission for the Protection of Monuments of Tsarskoye Selo, and was sent in spring 1918 to [[Siberia]] and the [[Volga]], where he worked in the summer of 1918 in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] for the newspaper ''People'' ("Народ").

After the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s came to power, Bianki worked in Biysk in the Department of Education at a regional museum where he served as director. He also worked as a school teacher for Comintern III. He was arrested twice in 1921, and in fear of further arrest, he moved his family in 1922 to [[Petrograd]].

==Career==
Bianki participated in scientific expeditions on the [[Volga]], [[Altai Krai]], [[Urals]] and [[Kazakhstan]] and brought back copious scientific notes, about which he wrote: "They were lying like a dead weight on my soul. They - as at the Zoological Museum - has been meeting the many dead animals in the dry record of facts, it was a forest, animals stagnation of immobility, no birds flew and did not sing. Then again, as in childhood, painfully wanted to find a word that would revive them magically compelled to come to life."

In 1923, Bianki began to publish a natural calendar in the [[Leningrad]] magazine ''Sparrow'' (later ''New Robinson''). This publication became a prototype of his later ''Forest newspapers every year'' (1927). In those years he became associated with a literary club, where writers of children's literature gathered. This included the writers [[Chukovsky]], [[Boris Zhitkov|Zhitkov]] and [[Marshak]]. Soon afterward his story "The Red Sparrow Traveling" was published in the magazine ''Sparrow''. Bianki’s first published book for children was titled ''Whose nose is better?'' (1923). His voluminous ''Forest Newspaper for Every Year'' (1st edition, 1928) is a peculiar encyclopedia of forest life and forest inhabitants.

At the end of 1925, Bianki was arrested again on suspicion of subversive activity and sentenced to three years of exile in [[Uralsk]]. In the spring of 1928, he was released to return to Leningrad. In November 1932 was arrested again, but was released after three and a half weeks for lack of evidence. In March 1935, he was arrested as an "active member of the armed uprising against Soviet rule" and taken to the [[Aktobe]] region, but was released after intercession by [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ex-wife, [[Yekaterina Peshkova]]. In 1941, he returned to Leningrad. Because of poor health he was not drafted to serve in the army for [[World War II]], but was evacuated to the Urals. After the war he returned again to Leningrad.

The body of his work consists of over three hundred short stories, fairy tales, stories, and articles, which make up 120 books. One of his students and followers was [[Nikolai Sladkov]], an author of books about nature.

Vitali Bianki died in Leningrad and was buried in the [[Bogoslovskoe Cemetery]].

'''Weather forecasting''' is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the [[weather]] informally for [[millennia]] and formally since the [[19th century]]. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative [[data]] about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using [[meteorology]] to project how the atmosphere will change.

Once calculated by hand based mainly upon changes in [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]], current weather conditions, and sky condition or [[cloud]] cover, weather forecasting now relies on [[numerical weather prediction|computer-based models]] that take many atmospheric factors into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dirmeyer|first1=Paul A.|last2=Schlosser|first2=C. Adam|last3=Brubaker|first3=Kaye L.|title=Precipitation, Recycling, and Land Memory: An Integrated Analysis|journal=Journal of Hydrometeorology|date=February 1, 2009|volume=10|issue=1|pages=278–288|doi=10.1175/2008JHM1016.1|bibcode=2009JHyMe..10..278D |hdl=1721.1/52326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, [[teleconnection]]s, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The inaccuracy of forecasting is due to the [[chaos theory|chaotic]] nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the ''range'' of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.

There are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on [[temperature]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are important to [[agriculture]], and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and [[wind chill]], forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2009, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fostering Innovation, Creating Jobs, Driving Better Decisions: The Value of Government Data |date=July 2014 |publisher=Economics and Statistics Administration Office of the Chief Economist |page=15 |url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/Reports/fostering-innovation-creating-jobs-driving-better-decisions-value-government-data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Ancient forecasting===
For millennia people have tried to forecast the weather. In 650&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Babylonia]]ns predicted the weather from cloud patterns as well as [[astrology]]. In about 350&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Aristotle]] described weather patterns in ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1994/5/94.05.01.x.html Meteorology by Lisa Alter]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Theophrastus]] compiled a book on weather forecasting, called the ''Book of Signs''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/cig/weather/forecasting-from-beginning.html "Weather: Forecasting from the Beginning"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[China|Chinese]] weather prediction lore extends at least as far back as 300&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[University of California]] Museum of Paleontology. [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html "Aristotle (384-322&amp;nbsp;B.C.E.)]". Retrieved 2008-01-12.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also around the same time ancient [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomers]] developed weather-prediction methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Indian and Pseudo-indian Passages in Greek and Latin Astronomical and Astrological Texts|author=[[David Pingree]]|pages=141–195 [143–4]|url=http://brepols.metapress.com/content/6861608670636388/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=2010-03-01|date=2017-12-14}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Testament times, Christ himself referred to deciphering and understanding local weather patterns, by saying, "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red', and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16:2-3&amp;version=ESV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 16:2-3 - English Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 904&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Ibn Wahshiyya]]'s ''Nabatean Agriculture'', translated into Arabic from an earlier [[Aramaic]] work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrara|first1=A.A|title=Geoponica and Nabatean Agriculture: A New Approach into Their Sources and Authorship|journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy|volume=16|issue=1|page=123–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; discussed the weather forecasting of atmospheric changes and signs from the planetary astral alterations; signs of rain based on observation of the [[lunar phase]]s; and weather forecasts based on the movement of winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahd|first=Toufic|page=842}}, in {{Cite book |last1=Rashed |first1=Roshdi |last2=Morelon |first2=Régis |year=1996 |title=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science |volume=3 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-415-12410-2 |pages=813–852|title-link=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, it might be observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather. This experience accumulated over the generations to produce [[weather lore]]. However, not all{{which|date=April 2015}} of these predictions prove reliable, and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.&lt;ref name=Skywatch&gt;{{cite web |author=Jerry Wilson |url=http://wilstar.com/skywatch.htm#indicators |title=Skywatch: Signs of the Weather |accessdate=2008-05-25 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130106041039/http://wilstar.com/skywatch.htm#indicators |archive-date=January 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern methods===
[[File:StateLibQld 1 186783 Royal Charter (ship).jpg|thumb|The ''Royal Charter'' sank in an 1859 storm, stimulating the establishment of modern weather forecasting.]]
It was not until the invention of the [[Electrical telegraph|electric telegraph]] in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |author=David Hochfelder |year=1998 | url=http://www.si.edu/archives/ihd/jhp/joseph20.htm| title=Joseph Henry: Inventor of the Telegraph? |publisher=Smithsonian Institution | accessdate=2006-06-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060626163000/http://www.si.edu/archives/ihd/jhp/joseph20.htm |archivedate = June 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day (160&amp;nbsp;km/d), but was more typically 40–75 miles per day (60–120&amp;nbsp;km/day) (whether by land or by sea).&lt;ref name="USPS History"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ausman|first=Megaera|title=USPS Historian|url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/overland-mail.htm|work=About the United States Postal Service|publisher=USPS|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Mail coaches"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mail|first=Royal|title=(UK)|url=http://postalheritage.org.uk/page/Mail-Coaches|work=British Postal Museum|publisher=Postal Heritage Trust|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-585850/telegraph "Telegraph"]. Retrieved 2007-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further [[Windward and leeward|upwind]].

The two men credited with the birth of forecasting as a science were an officer of the [[Royal Navy]] [[Francis Beaufort]] and his [[protégé]] [[Robert FitzRoy]]. Both were influential men in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] naval and governmental circles, and though ridiculed in the press at the time, their work gained scientific credence, was accepted by the [[Royal Navy]], and formed the basis for all of today's weather forecasting knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Eric D. Craft |year=2003 | title = An Economic History of Weather Forecasting | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070503193324/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/craft.weather.forcasting.history | archivedate = May 3, 2007 | url = http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/craft.weather.forcasting.history | accessdate =April 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=The birth of the weather forecast|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32483678 |publisher=BBC News |date=April 30, 2015 |accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaufort developed the [[Beaufort scale|Wind Force Scale]] and Weather Notation coding, which he was to use in his journals for the remainder of his life. He also promoted the development of reliable tide tables around British shores, and with his friend [[William Whewell]], expanded weather record-keeping at 200 British [[Coast guard]] stations.

Robert FitzRoy was appointed in 1854 as chief of a new department within the [[Board of Trade]] to deal with the collection of weather data at sea as a service to [[sailor|mariners]]. This was the forerunner of the modern [[Met Office|Meteorological Office]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; All ship captains were tasked with collating data on the weather and computing it, with the use of tested instruments that were loaned for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Mellersh, H. E. L. 1968"&gt;Mellersh, H. E. L. (1968). FitzRoy of the Beagle. Hart-Davis. {{ISBN|0-246-97452-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meyers b16 s0570.jpg|left|thumb|Weather map of Europe, December 10, 1887.]]
A storm in 1859 that caused the loss of the [[Royal Charter (ship)|''Royal Charter'']] inspired FitzRoy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made, which he called ''"forecasting the weather"'', thus coining the term "weather forecast".&lt;ref name="Mellersh, H. E. L. 1968"/&gt; Fifteen land stations were established to use the [[telegraph]] to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times leading to the first gale warning service. His warning service for shipping was initiated in February 1861, with the use of [[electric telegraph|telegraph communications]]. The first daily weather forecasts were published in ''[[The Times]]'' in 1861.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; In the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected.&lt;ref name="Kington"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climates of the British Isles: Present, Past and Future|first=John|last=Kington|editor=Mike Hulme and Elaine Barrow|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''"Weather Book"'' which FitzRoy published in 1863 was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time.

As the electric telegraph network expanded, allowing for the more rapid dissemination of warnings, a national observational network was developed, which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses. Instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using [[Photography#Science and forensics|photography]] were supplied to the observing stations from [[King's Observatory|Kew Observatory]] – these cameras had been invented by [[Francis Ronalds]] in 1845 and his [[barograph]] had earlier been used by FitzRoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.

To convey accurate information, it soon became necessary to have a standard vocabulary describing clouds; this was achieved by means of a series of classifications first achieved by [[Luke Howard]] in 1802, and standardized in the ''[[International Cloud Atlas]]'' of 1896.

===Numerical prediction===
{{Main article|History of numerical weather prediction}}
It was not until the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern [[numerical weather prediction]]. In 1922, English scientist [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] published "Weather Prediction By Numerical Process",&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Lewis Fry, ''Weather Prediction by Numerical Process'' (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1922). Available on-line at: [https://archive.org/stream/weatherpredictio00richrich#page/n7/mode/2up Internet Archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described therein how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations governing atmospheric flow could be neglected, and a finite differencing scheme in time and space could be devised, to allow numerical prediction solutions to be found.

Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, and the size of the grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical analysis, that this was due to [[numerical instability]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Lynch (meteorologist)|Lynch, Peter]] (2006). The Emergence of Numerical Weather Prediction. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists [[Jule Charney]], Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist [[Ragnar Fjørtoft]], applied mathematician [[John von Neumann]], and [[ENIAC]] programmer [[Klara Dan von Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;Charney, Fjörtoft and von Neumann, 1950, Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation

{{Main article|Numerical weather prediction}}

The basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[thermodynamics]] to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated [[weather station]]s at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The [[World Meteorological Organization]] acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide.

Models are ''initialized'' using this observed data. The irregularly spaced observations are processed by [[data assimilation]] and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms (usually an evenly spaced grid).

These equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined. The rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future. The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change, and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future. This ''time stepping'' procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time.

The length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain [[numerical stability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pielke|first=Roger A.|title=Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0-12-554766-6|pages=285–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JZikIbXzipwC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=time+step+numerical+weather+prediction#v=onepage&amp;q=time%20step%20numerical%20weather%20prediction&amp;f=false|page=132|title=Computational Science – ICCS 2005: 5th International Conference, Atlanta, GA, USA, May 22–25, 2005, Proceedings, Part 1|author1=Sunderam, V.

This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the [[chaos theory|chaotic nature]] of the [[fluid dynamics]] equations involved. In numerical models, extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Storm Watchers|pages=222–224|year=2002|author=Cox, John D.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-471-38108-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, a model is a computer program that produces [[meteorological]] information for future times at given locations and altitudes. Within any modern model is a set of equations, known as the primitive equations, used to predict the future state of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pielke|first=Roger A.|title=Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0-12-554766-6|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These equations—along with the [[ideal gas law]]—are used to evolve the [[density]], [[pressure]], and [[potential temperature]] [[scalar field]]s and the [[velocity]] [[vector field]] of the atmosphere through time.

Different models use different solution methods: some global models use [[spectral method]]s for the horizontal dimensions and [[finite difference method]]s for the vertical dimension, while regional models and other global models usually use finite-difference methods in all three dimensions.&lt;ref name="finite"/&gt;

==Techniques==

===Persistence===
The simplest method of forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This can be a valid way of forecasting the weather when it is in a steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and [[Long range weather forecast|long range forecasts]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

===Use of a barometer===
Measurements of barometric pressure and the pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) have been used in forecasting since the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[USA Today]]. [https://www.usatoday.com/weather/wbarocx.htm "Understanding air pressure"]. Retrieved 2008-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The larger the change in pressure, especially if more than {{convert|3.5|hPa|mmHg|lk=on|abbr=on}}, the larger the change in weather can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a [[Low pressure area|low pressure system]] is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. [[High pressure area|Rapid pressure rises]] are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.&lt;ref&gt;Weather Doctor.

===Looking at the sky===
[[File:marestail.jpg|thumb|Marestail shows moisture at high altitude, signalling the later arrival of wet weather.]]
Along with pressure tendency, the condition of the sky is one of the more important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of [[cloud]] cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. High thin [[cirrostratus cloud]]s can create [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]]s around the [[sun]] or [[moon]], which indicates an approach of a [[warm front]] and its associated [[rain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=halo+use+in+weather+forecasting+book&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=halo%20use%20in%20weather%20forecasting%20book&amp;f=false |magazine=[[Popular Mechanics]] |page=148 |title=Make Your Own Weather Forecasts |author=Dennis Eskow |date=March 1983 |volume=159 |issue=3 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morning [[fog]] portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation.

===Nowcasting===

[http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Nowcast] Retrieved 2015-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model.

==Communicating forecasts to the public==
[[File:Newspaper weather forecast - today and tomorrow.svg|frame|right|An example of a two-day weather forecast in the [[Visual language|visual style]] that an American newspaper might use. Temperatures are given in Fahrenheit.]]

Several countries employ government agencies to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories to the public in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests. Knowledge of what the end user needs from a weather forecast must be taken into account to present the information in a useful and understandable way. Examples include the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[National Weather Service]] (NWS)&lt;ref&gt;National Weather Service. [http://www.nws.noaa.gov/admin.php About "NOAA's National Weather Service"]. Retrieved 2007-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Environment Canada]]'s [[Meteorological Service of Canada|Meteorological Service]] (MSC).&lt;ref&gt;Environment Canada. [http://weather.gc.ca/canada_e.html "Canadian Weather"]. Retrieved 2007-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public. In addition, some cities had [[weather beacon]]s.  Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage. [http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/ac-ca/progs/ri-bpi/pubs/2005_02/4_e.cfm "Primary Sources of Local Information"].

===Severe weather alerts and advisories===
A major part of modern weather forecasting is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Weather Service]]. [http://www.weather.gov/mission.shtml National Weather Service Mission Statement].

Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, [[Flood warning|flood]], [[tropical cyclone]], and fog.&lt;ref&gt;[[Environment Canada]]. [http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/cd/brochures/warning_e.cfm? "Weather watches, warnings and advisories"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703204148/http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/cd/brochures/warning_e.cfm |date=2006-07-03 }} Retrieved 2008-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the [[Emergency Alert System]], which break into regular programming.&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Communications Commission]]. [https://www.fcc.gov/general/emergency-alert-system-eas "Emergency Alert System"]. Retrieved 2008-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low temperature forecast===
The low temperature forecast for the current day is calculated using the lowest temperature found between 7{{nbsp}}pm that evening through 7{{nbsp}}am the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Weather Channel]] - [http://feedback.weather.com/knowledgebase/articles/32098-weather-com-is-the-low-before-or-after-the-high Calculation of Low Temperature Forecast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906012055/http://feedback.weather.com/knowledgebase/articles/32098-weather-com-is-the-low-before-or-after-the-high |date=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So, in short, today's forecasted low is most likely tomorrow's low temperature.

== Specialist forecasting ==
There are a number of sectors with their own specific needs for weather forecasts and specialist services are provided to these users.

=== Air traffic ===

===Marine===
{{See also|Marine weather forecasting}}
Commercial and recreational use of waterways can be limited significantly by wind direction and speed, [[Ocean surface wave|wave]] periodicity and heights, tides, and precipitation. These factors can each influence the safety of marine transit. Consequently, a variety of codes have been established to efficiently transmit detailed marine weather forecasts to vessel pilots via radio, for example the [[MAFOR]] (marine forecast).&lt;ref&gt;Great Lakes and Seaway Shipping. [http://www.boatnerd.com/facts-figures/mafor.htm "MAFOR Weather Code"]. Retrieved 2008-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical weather forecasts can be received at sea through the use of [[RTTY]], [[Navtex]] and [[Radiofax]].

===Agriculture===

=== Forestry ===

Weather forecasting of wind, precipitations and humidity is essential for preventing and controlling [[wildfire]]s. Different indices, like the ''[[Forest fire weather index]]'' and the ''[[Haines Index]]'', have been developed to predict the areas more at risk to experience fire from natural or human causes. Conditions for the development of harmful insects can be predicted by forecasting the evolution of weather, too.

===Utility companies===
[[File:Air handling unit.JPG|thumb|right|An [[air handling unit]] is used for the heating and cooling of air in a central location (click on image for legend).]]
{{Main article|Degree day}}
Electricity and gas companies rely on weather forecasts to anticipate demand, which can be strongly affected by the weather. They use the quantity termed the degree day to determine how strong of a use there will be for heating ([[heating degree day]]) or cooling (cooling degree day). These quantities are based on a daily average temperature of {{convert|65|F}}. Cooler temperatures force heating degree days (one per degree Fahrenheit), while warmer temperatures force cooling degree days.&lt;ref&gt;[[Climate Prediction Center]].

The most common cause of wildfires varies throughout the world. In Canada and northwest China, lightning operates as the major source of ignition. In other parts of the world, human involvement is a major contributor. In Africa, Central America, Fiji, Mexico, New Zealand, South America, and Southeast Asia, wildfires can be attributed to human activities such as agriculture, [[animal husbandry]], and land-conversion burning. In China and in the [[Mediterranean Basin]], human carelessness is a major cause of wildfires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Zhihua|last2=Yang|first2=Jian|last3=Chang|first3=Yu|last4=Weisberg|first4=Peter J.|last5=He|first5=Hong S.|date=June 2012|title=Spatial patterns and drivers of fire occurrence and its future trend under climate change in a boreal forest of Northeast China|journal=Global Change Biology|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=2041–2056|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02649.x|issn=1354-1013|bibcode=2012GCBio..18.2041L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Rigo|first=Daniele|last2=Libertà|first2=Giorgio|last3=Houston Durrant|first3=Tracy|last4=Artés Vivancos|first4=Tomàs|last5=San-Miguel-Ayanz|first5=Jesús|title=Forest fire danger extremes in Europe under climate change: variability and uncertainty|page=71|date=2017|publisher=Publication Office of the European Union|location=Luxembourg|isbn=978-92-79-77046-3|doi=10.2760/13180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Australia, the source of wildfires can be traced both to lightning strikes and to human activities (such as machinery sparks, cast-away cigarette butts, or [[arson]]).&lt;ref name="Krock"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/world.html|title=The World on Fire|last=Krock|first=Lexi|date=June 2002|publisher=NOVA online – Public Broadcasting System (PBS)|accessdate=13 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027041902/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/world.html|archivedate=27 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balch|first=Jennifer K.|last2=Bradley|first2=Bethany A.|last3=Abatzoglou|first3=John T.|last4=Nagy|first4=R.

The spread of wildfires varies based on the flammable material present, its vertical arrangement and moisture content, and weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Graham, et al., iv"&gt;Graham, ''et al''., iv.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel arrangement and density is governed in part by [[topography]], as land shape determines factors such as available sunlight and water for plant growth. Overall, fire types can be generally characterized by their fuels as follows: 
* '''Ground''' fires are fed by subterranean roots, [[forest floor|duff]] and other buried [[organic matter]]. This fuel type is especially susceptible to ignition due to spotting. Ground fires typically burn by smoldering, and can burn slowly for days to months, such as [[Peat#Peat Fires|peat fires]] in [[Kalimantan]] and Eastern [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], which resulted from a [[Mega Rice Project (Kalimantan)|riceland creation project]] that unintentionally drained and dried the peat.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 9, 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4208564.stm | title = Asian peat fires add to warming | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) News | last = Rincon | first = Paul | date = 9 March 2005 | accessdate = 9 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081219064000/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4208564.stm | archivedate = 19 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildfires occur when all of the necessary elements of a [[fire triangle]] come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as [[vegetation]], that is subjected to sufficient heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are required to evaporate any water within the material and heat the material to its [[fire point]].&lt;ref name = FireBehavior/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIFC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_4.html|title=The Science of Wildland fire|publisher=National Interagency Fire Center|accessdate=21 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105175208/http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_4.html|archivedate=5 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater [[humidity]], and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires.&lt;ref name="Graham, et al., 12"&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''National Wildfire Coordinating Group Communicator's Guide For Wildland Fire Management'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants continuously lose water by [[evapotranspiration]], but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27148069/ | title = Ashes cover areas hit by Southern Calif. fires | agency = Associated Press | publisher = MSNBC | date = 15 November 2008 | accessdate = 4 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081209033149/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27148069/ | archivedate = 9 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.&lt;ref name=Structure&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/projects/hfi/2003/november/documents/forest-structure-wildfire.pdf | title = Influence of Forest Structure on Wildfire Behavior and the Severity of Its Effects | date = November 2003 | format = PDF | publisher = US Forest Service | accessdate = 19 November 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217125731/http://www.fs.fed.us/projects/hfi/2003/november/documents/forest-structure-wildfire.pdf | archivedate = 17 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fema.gov/hazard/wildfire/wf_prepare.shtm | title = Prepare for a Wildfire | publisher = Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) | accessdate = 1 December 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081029025706/https://www.fema.gov/hazard/wildfire/wf_prepare.shtm | archivedate = 29 October 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wildfire ''front'' is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the [[smolder]]ing transition between unburned and burned material.&lt;ref&gt;''Glossary of Wildland Fire Terminology'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt; As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through [[convection]] and [[thermal radiation]].

Intensity also increases during daytime hours. Burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day due to lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds.&lt;ref&gt;de Souza Costa and Sandberg, 228&lt;/ref&gt; Sunlight warms the ground during the day which creates air currents that travel uphill.

Wildfire's occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wildfires are common in climates that are sufficiently moist to allow the growth of vegetation but feature extended dry, hot periods.&lt;ref name=NOVA /&gt; Such places include the vegetated areas of Australia and [[Southeast Asia]], the [[veld]] in southern Africa, the [[fynbos]] in the Western Cape of South Africa, the forested areas of the United States and Canada, and the [[Mediterranean Basin]].

High-severity wildfire creates [[complex early seral forest]] habitat (also called “snag forest habitat”), which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Plant and animal species in most types of North American forests evolved with fire, and many of these species depend on wildfires, and particularly high-severity fires, to reproduce and grow. Fire helps to return nutrients from plant matter back to soil, the heat from fire is necessary to the germination of certain types of seeds, and the snags (dead trees) and early successional forests created by high-severity fire create habitat conditions that are beneficial to wildlife.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Early successional forests created by high-severity fire support some of the highest levels of native biodiversity found in temperate conifer forests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donato|first=Daniel C.|last2=Fontaine|first2=Joseph B.|last3=Robinson|first3=W.

Such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate [[competition]]. For example, plants of the genus ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard [[sclerophyll]] leaves to resist heat and drought, ensuring their dominance over less fire-tolerant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/section3.htm | title=Section Three: Problems, Cares, Economics, and Species | work=The Eucalyptus of California | first=Robert L. | last=Santos | publisher=California State University | date=1997 | accessdate=26 June 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602175115/http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/section3.htm | archivedate=2 June 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fire.

{{Further|Fossil record of fire}}
In the [[Welsh Borders]], the first evidence of wildfire is [[Rhyniophyta|rhyniophytoid]] plant fossils preserved as [[charcoal]], dating to the [[Silurian]] period (about {{ma|420}}).

Wildfires during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods followed patterns similar to fires that occur in modern times. Surface fires driven by dry seasons{{clarify|does this mean annual dry seasons or erratic droughts?|date=October 2015}} are evident in Devonian and Carboniferous [[progymnosperm]] forests.  [[Lepidodendron]] forests dating to the Carboniferous period have charred peaks, evidence of crown fires.

As these grasses shifted to more [[mesic habitat]]s, their high flammability increased fire frequency, promoting grasslands over woodlands.&lt;ref&gt;Pausas and Keeley, 595&lt;/ref&gt; However, fire-prone habitats may have contributed to the prominence of trees such as those of the genera ''[[Eucalyptus]]'', ''Pinus'' and ''[[Sequoia (genus)|Sequoia]]'', which have thick bark to withstand fires and employ [[serotiny]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausas and Keeley, 596&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Wildfires typically occurred during periods of increased temperature and drought. An increase in fire-related [[debris flow]] in [[alluvial fan]]s of northeastern [[Yellowstone National Park]] was linked to the period between AD 1050 and 1200, coinciding with the [[Medieval Warm Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyer |first=G.A. |last2=Wells |first2=S.G.|last3=Jull|first3=A.J.T.|date=1995|title=Fire and alluvial chronology in Yellowstone National Park: Climatic and intrinsic controls on Holocene geomorphic processes|journal=GSA Bulletin|issue=10|pages=1211–1230 |doi= 10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107&lt;1211:FAACIY&gt;2.3.CO;2 |volume= 107 |bibcode = 1995GSAB..107.1211M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human influence caused an increase in fire frequency.

However, a period of increased fire frequency between 1750 and 1870 was suggested by charcoal data from North America and Asia, attributed to human population growth and influences such as land clearing practices. This period was followed by an overall decrease in burning in the 20th century, linked to the expansion of agriculture, increased livestock grazing, and fire prevention efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v1/n10/full/ngeo313.html |title=Climate and human influences on global biomass burning over the past two millennia |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |pages=697–702 |date=2008 |doi=10.1038/ngeo313 |bibcode=2008NatGe...1..697M |author=J.

Researchers explain this a transition from [[nomadism]] to settled lifestyle and intensification of [[agriculture]] that lead to a drop in the use of fire for land clearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90493|title= Researchers Detect a Global Drop in Fires|author= &lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date= June 30, 2017|website= [[NASA Earth Observatory]]|publisher= |access-date= July 4, 2017|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171208175626/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90493|archivedate= 8 December 2017|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Andela|first1= N.|last2= Morton|first2= D.C.|display-authors= etal|date= June 30, 2017|title= A human-driven decline in global burned area|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1356|journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume= 356|issue= 6345|pages= 1356–1362|doi= 10.1126/science.aal4108|pmid= 28663495|pmc= 6047075|access-date= July 4, 2017|bibcode= 2017Sci...356.1356A|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170702220009/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1356|archivedate= 2 July 2017|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increases of certain native tree species (i.e. [[conifers]]) in favor of others (i.e. leaf trees) also increases wildfire risk, especially if these trees are also planted in [[monoculture]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2018-07-biodiversity-criticism-sweden-forest-industry.html Fires spark biodiversity criticism of Sweden's forest industry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BE6B5/(httpNews)/531DAFFB8B319F69C125792E00499ED1 The Great Lie: Monoculture Trees as Forests]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[invasive species]], moved in by humans (i.e., for the [[Pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper industry]]) have in some cases also increased the intensity of wildfires. Examples include species such as [[Eucalyptus]] in California&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.sc.us/forest/scplants.pdf Plant flammability list]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.firesafemarin.org/plants/fire-prone Fire-prone plant list]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gamba grass]] in Australia.

Wildfire prevention refers to the preemptive methods aimed at reducing the risk of fires as well as lessening its severity and spread.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Prevention techniques aim to manage air quality, maintain ecological balances, protect resources,&lt;ref name="van Wagtendonk, 14"/&gt; and to affect future fires.&lt;ref&gt;van Wagtendonk (1996), 1156.&lt;/ref&gt; North American firefighting policies permit naturally caused fires to burn to maintain their ecological role, so long as the risks of escape into high-value areas are mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;''Interagency Strategy for the Implementation of the Federal Wildland Fire Policy'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; However, prevention policies must consider the role that humans play in wildfires, since, for example, 95% of forest fires in Europe are related to human involvement.&lt;ref&gt;San-Miguel-Ayanz, ''et al.'', 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of human-caused fire may include arson, accidental ignition, or the uncontrolled use of fire in land-clearing and agriculture such as the slash-and-burn farming in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 7, 11–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] initiated a nationwide fire prevention campaign, highlighting the role of human carelessness in forest fires. Later posters of the program featured [[Uncle Sam]], characters from the Disney movie ''[[Bambi]]'', and the official mascot of the [[U.S. Forest Service]], [[Smokey Bear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smokeybear.com/vault/default.asp?js=1 | title=Smokey's Journey | publisher=Smokeybear.com | accessdate=26 January 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306051136/http://www.smokeybear.com/vault/default.asp?js=1 | archivedate=6 March 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing human-caused ignitions may be the most effective means of reducing unwanted wildfire.

Vegetation may be burned periodically to maintain high species diversity and frequent burning of surface fuels limits fuel accumulation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''Fire. The Australian Experience'', 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Wildland fire use is the cheapest and most ecologically appropriate policy for many forests.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Fuels may also be removed by logging, but fuels treatments and thinning have no effect on severe fire behavior&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Wildfire models are often used to predict and compare the benefits of different fuel treatments on future wildfire spread, but their accuracy is low.&lt;ref name="Graham, et al., iv" /&gt;

Wildfire itself is reportedly "the most effective treatment for reducing a fire's rate of spread, fireline intensity, flame length, and heat per unit of area" according to Jan van Wagtendonk, a biologist at the Yellowstone Field Station.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;van Wagtendonk (1996), 1164&lt;/ref&gt;

Building codes in fire-prone areas typically require that structures be built of flame-resistant materials and a [[defensible space (fire control)|defensible space]] be maintained by clearing flammable materials within a prescribed distance from the structure.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fire.ca.gov/fire_prevention/downloads/FHSZBSR_Backgrounder.pdf | format = PDF | title = California's Fire Hazard Severity Zone Update and Building Standards Revision | publisher = CAL FIRE | date = May 2007 | accessdate = 18 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090226080558/http://www.fire.ca.gov/fire_prevention/downloads/FHSZBSR_Backgrounder.pdf | archivedate = 26 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_1551-1600/sb_1595_bill_20080927_chaptered.pdf | format = PDF | title = California Senate Bill No. 1595, Chapter 366 | publisher = State of California | date = 27 September 2008 | accessdate = 18 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120330120658/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_1551-1600/sb_1595_bill_20080927_chaptered.pdf | archivedate = 30 March 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities in the [[Philippines]] also maintain [[fire line]]s {{convert|5|to|10|m|sp=us|ft}} wide between the forest and their village, and patrol these lines during summer months or seasons of dry weather.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Continued residential development in fire-prone areas and rebuilding structures destroyed by fires has been met with criticism.&lt;ref name="Trial2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.onearth.org/article/our-trial-by-fire?page=2 | title = Our Trial by Fire | last = Manning | first = Richard | publisher = onearth.org | date = 1 December 2007 | accessdate = 7 January 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080630035505/http://www.onearth.org/article/our-trial-by-fire?page=2 | archivedate = 30 June 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecological benefits of fire are often overridden by the economic and safety benefits of protecting structures and human life.&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.economics.noaa.gov/?goal=ecosystems&amp;file=events/fire/ | title = Extreme Events: Wild &amp; Forest Fire | publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) | accessdate = 7 January 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090114111211/http://www.economics.noaa.gov/?goal=ecosystems&amp;file=events%2Ffire%2F | archivedate = 14 January 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fast and effective detection is a key factor in wildfire fighting.&lt;ref&gt;San-Miguel-Ayanz, ''et al.'', 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Early detection efforts were focused on early response, accurate results in both daytime and nighttime, and the ability to prioritize fire danger.&lt;ref name=Integration&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.westerndisastercenter.org/DOCUMENTS/PERS_PAPER.pdf | format = PDF | title = An Integration of Remote Sensing, GIS, and Information Distribution for Wildfire Detection and Management | journal = Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing | volume = 64 | issue = 10 | date = October 1998 | pages = 977–985 | accessdate = 26 June 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090816123809/http://www.westerndisastercenter.org/DOCUMENTS/PERS_PAPER.pdf | archivedate = 16 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fire lookout tower]]s were used in the United States in the early 20th century and fires were reported using telephones, [[carrier pigeon]]s, and [[heliograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://archives.cbc.ca/version_print.asp?page=1&amp;IDLan=1&amp;IDClip=4917&amp;IDDossier=849&amp;IDCat=346&amp;IDCatPa=261 | title = Radio communication keeps rangers in touch | publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Digital Archives | date = 21 August 1957 | accessdate = 6 February 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090813160525/http://archives.cbc.ca/version_print.asp?page=1&amp;IDLan=1&amp;IDClip=4917&amp;IDDossier=849&amp;IDCat=346&amp;IDCatPa=261 | archivedate = 13 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerial and land photography using [[instant camera]]s were used in the 1950s until [[infrared photography|infrared scanning]] was developed for fire detection in the 1960s. However, information analysis and delivery was often delayed by limitations in communication technology. Early satellite-derived fire analyses were hand-drawn on maps at a remote site and sent via overnight mail to the [[incident commander|fire manager]]. During the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]], a data station was established in [[West Yellowstone]], permitting the delivery of satellite-based fire information in approximately four hours.&lt;ref name = Integration/&gt;

Currently, public hotlines, [[fire lookout]]s in towers, and ground and aerial patrols can be used as a means of early detection of forest fires. However, accurate human observation may be limited by [[asthenopia|operator fatigue]], time of day, time of year, and geographic location. Electronic systems have gained popularity in recent years as a possible resolution to human operator error. A government report on a recent trial of three automated camera fire detection systems in Australia did, however, conclude "...detection by the camera systems was slower and less reliable than by a trained human observer". These systems may be semi- or fully automated and employ systems based on the risk area and degree of human presence, as suggested by [[Geographic information system|GIS]] data analyses. An integrated approach of multiple systems can be used to merge satellite data, aerial imagery, and personnel position via [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) into a collective whole for near-realtime use by wireless [[Incident Command System|Incident Command Centers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forestry.state.al.us/WildfireControl.aspx?bv=1&amp;s=0 | title = Wildfire Detection and Control | publisher = Alabama Forestry Commission | accessdate = 12 January 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081120135635/http://www.forestry.state.al.us/WildfireControl.aspx?bv=1&amp;s=0 | archivedate = 20 November 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Evaluation of three wildfire smoke detection systems", 4&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2015 a new fire detection tool is in operation at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) which uses data from the [[Suomi NPP|Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership]] (NPP) satellite to detect smaller fires in more detail than previous space-based products. The high-resolution data is used with a computer model to predict how a fire will change direction based on weather and land conditions.  The active fire detection product using data from Suomi NPP's [[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite]] (VIIRS) increases the resolution of fire observations to 1,230 feet (375 meters). Previous NASA satellite data products available since the early 2000s observed fires at 3,280 foot (1 kilometer) resolution. The data is one of the intelligence tools used by the USFS and Department of Interior agencies across the United States to guide resource allocation and strategic fire management decisions. The enhanced VIIRS fire product enables detection every 12 hours or less of much smaller fires and provides more detail and consistent tracking of fire lines during long duration wildfires – capabilities critical for early warning systems and support of routine mapping of fire progression. Active fire locations are available to users within minutes from the satellite overpass through data processing facilities at the USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center, which uses technologies developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Direct Readout Laboratory in Greenbelt, Maryland. The model uses data on weather conditions and the land surrounding an active fire to predict 12–18 hours in advance whether a blaze will shift direction. The state of Colorado decided to incorporate the weather-fire model in its firefighting efforts beginning with the 2016 fire season.

In 2014, an international campaign was organized in South Africa's Kruger National Park to validate fire detection products including the new VIIRS active fire data. In advance of that campaign, the Meraka Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria, South Africa, an early adopter of the VIIRS 375m fire product, put it to use during several large wildfires in Kruger.

The demand for timely, high-quality fire information has increased in recent years. Wildfires in the United States burn an average of 7 million acres of land each year. For the last 10 years, the USFS and Department of Interior have spent a combined average of about $2–4 billion annually on wildfire suppression.

[[File:RIAN archive 733844 Forest fires ravaging near Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant.jpg|thumb|A Russian firefighter extinguishing a wildfire]]
Wildfire suppression depends on the technologies available in the area in which the wildfire occurs. In less developed nations the techniques used can be as simple as throwing sand or beating the fire with sticks or palm fronds.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 16&lt;/ref&gt; In more advanced nations, the suppression methods vary due to increased technological capacity. [[Silver iodide]] can be used to encourage snow fall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195969,00.html |title=China Makes Snow to Extinguish Forest Fire |publisher=FOXNews.com |accessdate=10 July 2009 |date=18 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813173448/http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195969,00.html |archivedate=13 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[fire retardant]]s and water can be dropped onto fires by [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, [[airtanker|planes]], and [[helitack|helicopters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/WRAP//projects/docs/ISRSE_PAPER_2003.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=21 July 2009 |title=Disaster Management Applications – Fire |first=Vincent G. |last=Ambrosia |publisher=NASA-Ames Research Center |date=2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724081427/http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/WRAP/projects/docs/ISRSE_PAPER_2003.PDF |archivedate=24 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plucinski, ''et al.'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; Complete fire suppression is no longer an expectation, but the majority of wildfires are often extinguished before they grow out of control. While more than 99% of the 10,000 new wildfires each year are contained, escaped wildfires under extreme weather conditions are difficult to suppress without a change in the weather. Wildfires in Canada and the US burn an average of {{convert|54500|km2|acre|sigfig=2|sp=us}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/17/f-forest-fires.html |title=Fighting fire in the forest |publisher=CBS News |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619212242/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/17/f-forest-fires.html |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/?report=fire&amp;year=2008&amp;month=13 | title = Climate of 2008 Wildfire Season Summary | publisher = National Climatic Data Center | date = 11 December 2008 | accessdate = 7 January 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151023095354/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/?report=fire&amp;year=2008&amp;month=13 | archivedate = 23 October 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above all, fighting wildfires can become deadly. A wildfire's burning front may also change direction unexpectedly and jump across fire breaks. Intense heat and smoke can lead to disorientation and loss of appreciation of the direction of the fire, which can make fires particularly dangerous. For example, during the 1949 [[Mann Gulch fire]] in [[Montana]], USA, thirteen [[smokejumper]]s died when they lost their communication links, became disoriented, and were overtaken by the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr299/ | title = General Technical Report INT-GTR-299 – Mann Gulch Fire: A Race That Couldn't Be Won | publisher = United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station | date = May 1993 | last = Rothermel | first = Richard C. | accessdate = 26 June 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090813122911/http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr299/ | archivedate = 13 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Australian [[February 2009 Victorian bushfires]], at least 173 people died and over 2,029 homes and 3,500 structures were lost when they became engulfed by wildfire.&lt;ref name="homeslost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|title=Victorian Bushfires|date=13 March 2009|publisher=New South Wales Government|work=Parliament of New South Wales|accessdate=26 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227231203/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|archivedate=27 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs of wildfire suppression ===
In California, the U.S. Forest Service spends about $200 million per year to suppress 98% of wildfires and up to $1 billion to suppress the other 2% of fires that escape initial attack and become large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/?cid=stelprdb5412095|title=Region 5 – Land &amp; Resource Management|website=www.fs.usda.gov|access-date=2016-08-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823005834/http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/?cid=stelprdb5412095|archivedate=23 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wildland firefighting safety ===
[[File:Wildfire fighter.jpg|thumb|right|Wildfire fighters cutting down a tree using a chainsaw]]
Wildland fire fighters face several life-threatening hazards including [[heat stress]], [[fatigue (safety)|fatigue]], [[smoke]] and [[dust]], as well as the risk of other injuries such as [[burn]]s, [[wound|cuts]] and [[Abrasion (medical)|scrapes]], [[animal bites]], and even [[rhabdomyolysis]].&lt;ref name=niosh-blog&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildland Fire Fighting Safety and Health|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/wildlandfire/|work=NIOSH Science Blog|publisher=National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=6 August 2012|first=Corey|last=Campbell|author2=Liz Dalsey|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809023909/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/wildlandfire/|archivedate=9 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hot Tips from NIOSH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildland Fire Fighting: Hot Tips to Stay Safe and Healthy|url=https://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/docs/2013-158/pdfs/2013-158.pdf|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=21 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030104/http://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/docs/2013-158/pdfs/2013-158.pdf|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000&amp;ndash;2016, more than 350&amp;nbsp;wildland firefighters died on-duty.&lt;ref name="NIOSH Wildland Firefighting default page"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/firefighting/default.html |title=CDC - Fighting Wildfires - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic |date=May 31, 2018 |website=www.cdc.gov |publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] |language=en-us |access-date=2018-11-27 |quote=Between 2000-2016, based on data compiled in the NIOSH Wildland Fire Fighter On-Duty Death Surveillance System from three data sources, over 350 on-duty WFF fatalities occurred.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in hot weather condition, fires present the risk of heat stress, which can entail feeling heat, fatigue, weakness, vertigo, headache, or nausea. Heat stress can progress into heat strain, which entails physiological changes such as increased heart rate and core body temperature. This can lead to heat-related illnesses, such as heat rash, cramps, exhaustion or [[heat stroke]]. Various factors can contribute to the risks posed by heat stress, including strenuous work, personal risk factors such as age and [[Physical fitness|fitness]], dehydration, sleep deprivation, and burdensome [[personal protective equipment]]. Rest, cool water, and occasional breaks are crucial to mitigating the effects of heat stress.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

Smoke, ash, and debris can also pose serious respiratory hazards to wildland fire fighters. The smoke and dust from wildfires can contain gases such as [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[formaldehyde]], as well as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[Wood ash|ash]] and [[silica]]. To reduce smoke exposure, wildfire fighting crews should, whenever possible, rotate firefighters through areas of heavy smoke, avoid downwind firefighting, use equipment rather than people in holding areas, and minimize mop-up. Camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires. Protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and ash.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

Firefighters are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks. Fire fighters should maintain good physical fitness. Fitness programs, medical screening and examination programs which include stress tests can minimize the risks of firefighting cardiac problems.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt; Other injury hazards wildland fire fighters face include slips, trips and falls, burns, scrapes and cuts from tools and equipment, being struck by trees, vehicles, or other objects, plant hazards such as thorns and poison ivy, snake and animal bites, vehicle crashes, electrocution from power lines or lightning storms, and unstable building structures.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

==Fire retardant==
Fire retardants are used to slow wildfires by inhibiting combustion. They are aqueous solutions of ammonium phosphates and ammonium sulfates, as well as thickening agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Agueda |author2=E. Pastor |author3=E. Planas |year=2008|title=Different scales for studying the effectiveness of long-term forest fire retardants|journal=Progress in Energy and Combustion Science|volume=24|issue=6|pages=782–796|doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to apply retardant depends on the magnitude, location and intensity of the wildfire.   In certain instances, fire retardant may also be applied as a precautionary fire defense measure.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Magill, B.|title=Officials: Fire slurry poses little threat|work=Coloradoan.com|url=http://www.coloradoan.com/article/20120706/NEWS01/307060035/Officials-Fire-slurry-poses-little-threat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical fire retardants contain the same agents as fertilizers.  Fire retardant may also affect water quality through leaching, eutrophication, or misapplication. Fire retardant's effects on drinking water remain inconclusive.&lt;ref name="minesnewsroom.com"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boerner, C. |author2=Coday B. |author3=Noble, J. |author4=Roa, P. |author5=Roux V. |author6=Rucker K. |author7=Wing, A. |year=2012 |title=Impact of wildfire in Clear Creek Watershed of the city of Golden's drinking water supply |publisher=Colorado School of Mines |url=http://minesnewsroom.com/sites/default/files/wysiwyg-editor/Impacts%20of%20wildfire%20on%20Golden%27s%20drinking%20water-1.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112021046/http://minesnewsroom.com/sites/default/files/wysiwyg-editor/Impacts%20of%20wildfire%20on%20Golden%27s%20drinking%20water-1.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dilution factors, including water body size, rainfall, and water flow rates lessen the concentration and potency of fire retardant.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"/&gt; Wildfire debris (ash and sediment) clog rivers and reservoirs increasing the risk for floods and erosion that ultimately slow and/or damage water treatment systems.&lt;ref name="minesnewsroom.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eichenseher, T.|year=2012|title=Colorado Wildfires Threaten Water Supplies|work=National Geographic Daily News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120703/colorado-wildfires-waldo-high-park-hayman-threaten-water-supplies/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710084010/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120703/colorado-wildfires-waldo-high-park-hayman-threaten-water-supplies/|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is continued concern of fire retardant effects on land, water, wildlife habitats, and watershed quality, additional research is needed. However, on the positive side, fire retardant (specifically its nitrogen and phosphorus components) has been shown to have a fertilizing effect on nutrient-deprived soils and thus creates a temporary increase in vegetation.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"/&gt;

Current USDA procedure maintains that the aerial application of fire retardant in the United States must clear waterways by a minimum of 300 feet in order to safeguard effects of retardant runoff. Aerial uses of fire retardant are required to avoid application near waterways and endangered species (plant and animal habitats).  After any incident of fire retardant misapplication, the U.S. Forest Service requires reporting and assessment impacts be made in order to determine mitigation, remediation, and/or restrictions on future retardant uses in that area.

Wildfire modeling is concerned with [[numerical simulation]] of wildfires in order to comprehend and predict fire behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://firegrowthmodel.ca/  | title = Prometheus  | publisher = Tymstra, C.; Bryce, R.W.; Wotton, B.M.; Armitage, O.B. 2009.

Using [[computational science]], wildfire modeling involves the statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior. Various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in the past, including simple ellipses and egg- and fan-shaped models. Early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity. However, the exact behavior of a wildfire's front is dependent on a variety of factors, including windspeed and slope steepness. Modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and [[Huygens' Principle]] to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding polygon.&lt;ref&gt;G.D. Richards, "An Elliptical Growth Model of Forest Fire Fronts and Its Numerical Solution", Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng.. 30:1163–1179, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finney, 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Extreme value theory]] may also be used to predict the size of large wildfires. However, large fires that exceed suppression capabilities are often regarded as statistical outliers in standard analyses, even though fire policies are more influenced by large wildfires than by small fires.&lt;ref name="Alvarado, et al., 66-68"&gt;Alvarado, ''et al''., 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human risk and exposure==
{{wide image|2009 California Wildfires at JPL - Pasadena, California.jpg|933px|2009 California Wildfires at [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|NASA/JPL]] – Pasadena, California}}

Wildfire risk is the chance that a wildfire will start in or reach a particular area and the potential loss of human values if it does. Risk is dependent on variable factors such as human activities, weather patterns, availability of wildfire fuels, and the availability or lack of resources to suppress a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Oregon State University|title=About Oregon wildfire risk|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://oeapp.oregonexplorer.info/Wildfire/topics/topics.aspx?Res=16142|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218072405/http://oeapp.oregonexplorer.info/Wildfire/topics/topics.aspx?Res=16142|archivedate=18 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires have continually been a threat to human populations. However, human induced geographical and climatic changes are exposing populations more frequently to wildfires and increasing wildfire risk. It is speculated that the increase in wildfires arises from a century of wildfire suppression coupled with the rapid expansion of human developments into fire-prone wildlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr208en/psw_gtr208en_505-512_haines.pdf |title=The National Wildfire Mitigation Programs Database: State, County, and Local Efforts to Reduce Wildfire Risk |publisher=US Forest Service |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907045339/http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr208en/psw_gtr208en_505-512_haines.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires are naturally occurring events that aid in promoting forest health. Global warming and climate changes are causing an increase in temperatures and more droughts nationwide which contributes to an increase in wildfire risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2013/extreme-wildfires-may-be-fueled-by-climate-change/|title=Extreme wildfires may be fueled by climate change|publisher=Michigan State University|date=1 August 2013|accessdate=1 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803213631/http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2013/extreme-wildfires-may-be-fueled-by-climate-change/|archivedate=3 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mprIejWp00|title=White House explains the link between Climate Change and Wild Fires|date=August 5, 2014|work=YouTube|author=Rajamanickam Antonimuthu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811074119/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mprIejWp00|archivedate=11 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airborne hazards===
The most noticeable adverse effect of wildfires is the destruction of property. However, the release of hazardous chemicals from the burning of wildland fuels also significantly impacts health in humans.

Wildfire smoke is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Other common smoke components present in lower concentrations are carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acrolein, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and benzene.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment|year=2008|title=Wildfire smoke: A guide for public health officials|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://oehha.ca.gov/air/risk_assess/wildfirev8.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516071549/http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/risk_assess/wildfirev8.pdf|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small particulates suspended in air which come in solid form or in liquid droplets are also present in smoke. 80 -90% of wildfire smoke, by mass, is within the fine particle size class of 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Wildlife Coordination Group|year=2001|title=Smoke management guide for prescribed and wildland fire|location=Boise, ID|publisher=National Interagency Fire Center|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/ottmar-smoke-management-guide.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011200515/http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/ottmar-smoke-management-guide.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite carbon dioxide's high concentration in smoke, it poses a low health risk due to its low toxicity. Rather, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter, particularly 2.5&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter and smaller, have been identified as the major health threats.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"/&gt; Other chemicals are considered to be significant hazards but are found in concentrations that are too low to cause detectable health effects.

The degree of wildfire smoke exposure to an individual is dependent on the length, severity, duration, and proximity of the fire. People are exposed directly to smoke via the respiratory tract though inhalation of air pollutants. Indirectly, communities are exposed to wildfire debris that can contaminate soil and water supplies.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) developed the [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI), a public resource that provides national air quality standard concentrations for common air pollutants. The public can use this index as a tool to determine their exposure to hazardous air pollutants based on visibility range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|year=2009|title=Air quality index: A guide to air quality and health|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://www.epa.gov/airnow/aqi_brochure_08-09.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507130507/http://www.epa.gov/airnow/aqi_brochure_08-09.pdf|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-fire risks===
After a wildfire, hazards remain. Residents returning to their homes may be at risk from falling fire-weakened trees. Humans and pets may also be harmed by falling into [[ash pit]]s.

=== At-Risk Groups ===

==== Firefighters====
Firefighters are at the greatest risk for acute and chronic health effects resulting from wildfire smoke exposure. Due to firefighters' occupational duties, they are frequently exposed to [[Chemical hazard|hazardous chemicals]] at a close proximity for longer periods of time. A case study on the exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]-permissible exposure limits (PEL) and ACGIH threshold limit values (TLV). 5–10% are overexposed. The study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10-hour shift spent holding down a fireline. The firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritant (combination of particulate matter 3.5&amp;nbsp;µm and smaller, acrolein, and formaldehype) levels. Carbon monoxide levels reached up to 160ppm and the TLV irritant index value reached a high of 10. In contrast, the OSHA PEL for carbon monoxide is 30ppm and for the TLV respiratory irritant index, the calculated threshold limit value is 1; any value above 1 exceeds exposure limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Reinhardt|first2=T.E.|last3=Quiring|first3=S.J.|last4=Ottmar|first4=R.D.|year=2004|title=A screening-level assessment of the health risks of chronic smoke exposure for wildland firefighters|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/publications/fulltext/boozeetal2004.pdf|journal=Journal Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|volume=1|issue=5|pages=296–305|doi=10.1080/15459620490442500|pmid=15238338|last1=Booze|first1=T.F.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530185250/https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/publications/fulltext/boozeetal2004.pdf|archivedate=30 May 2017|df=dmy-all|citeseerx=10.1.1.541.5076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2001 and 2012, over 200 [[Occupational fatality|fatalities]] occurred among wildland firefighters. In addition to heat and chemical hazards, firefighters are also at risk for electrocution from power lines; injuries from equipment; [[Occupational injury|slips, trips, and falls]]; injuries from vehicle rollovers; [[Heat illness|heat-related illness]]; [[insect bites and stings]]; [[Occupational stress|stress]]; and [[rhabdomyolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-158/|title=CDC – NIOSH Publications and Products – Wildland Fire Fighting: Hot Tips to Stay Safe and Healthy (2013–158)|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122154309/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-158/|archivedate=22 November 2016|df=dmy-all|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2013158|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Residents ====
Residents in communities surrounding wildfires are exposed to lower concentrations of chemicals, but they are at a greater risk for indirect exposure through water or soil contamination. Exposure to residents is greatly dependent on individual susceptibility. Vulnerable persons such as children (ages 0–4), the elderly (ages 65 and older), smokers, and pregnant women are at an increased risk due to their already compromised body systems, even when the exposures are present at low chemical concentrations and for relatively short exposure periods.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov" /&gt;

==== Fetal exposure ====
Additionally, there is evidence of an increase in maternal stress, as documented by researchers M.H. O'Donnell and A.M. Behie, thus affecting birth outcomes.  In Australia, studies show that male infants born with drastically higher average birth weights were born in mostly severely fire-affected areas.  This is attributed to the fact that maternal signals directly affect fetal growth patterns.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=1&amp;SID=3A7lyhAIveCBgjBAcZa&amp;page=2&amp;doc=16{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/11/15/emph.eov027.abstract?papetoc|title = Effects of wildfire disaster exposure on male birth weight in an Australian population.|last = O'Donnell|first = M H|date = November 15, 2015|journal = Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health|doi = 10.1093/emph/eov027|pmid = 26574560|access-date = January 27, 2016|last2 = Behie|first2 = A M|volume = 2015|issue = 1|issn = 2050-6201|pages = 344–354|pmc = 4697771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Jia Coco|last2=Wilson|first2=Ander|last3=Mickley|first3=Loretta J.|last4=Dominici|first4=Francesca|last5=Ebisu|first5=Keita|last6=Wang|first6=Yun|last7=Sulprizio|first7=Melissa P.|last8=Peng|first8=Roger D.|last9=Yue|first9=Xu|date=January 2017|title=Wildfire-specific Fine Particulate Matter and Risk of Hospital Admissions in Urban and Rural Counties|journal=Epidemiology|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=77–85|doi=10.1097/ede.0000000000000556|issn=1044-3983|pmc=5130603|pmid=27648592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[water vapor]], [[particulate matter]], organic chemicals, [[Nitrogen oxide|nitrogen oxides]] and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/smoke/wildgd.pdf |title=1 Wildfire Smoke A Guide for Public Health Officials |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509110731/http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/smoke/wildgd.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Jin-Zhun|last2=Ge|first2=Dan-Dan|last3=Zhou|first3=Lin-Fu|last4=Hou|first4=Ling-Yun|last5=Zhou|first5=Ying|last6=Li|first6=Qi-Yuan|date=June 2018|title=Effects of particulate matter on allergic respiratory diseases|journal=Chronic Diseases and Translational Medicine|volume=4|issue=2|pages=95–102|doi=10.1016/j.cdtm.2018.04.001|issn=2095-882X|pmc=6034084|pmid=29988900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In asthma patients, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream like PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; however studies show that it works into the blood much quicker. The inflammation and epithelial damage done by UFP has also shown to be much more severe.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is of the largest concern in regards to wildfire.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This is particularly hazardous to the very young, elderly and those with chronic conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis and cardiovascular conditions. The illnesses most commonly with exposure to fine particle from wildfire smoke are bronchitis, exacerbation of asthma or COPD, and pneumonia. Symptoms of these complications include wheezing and shortness of breath and cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain, rapid heart rate and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.nurpra.2011.07.001 |title=Wildfire Smoke Exposure: A Guide for the Nurse Practitioner |date=2012 |last1=Forsberg |first1=Nicole T. |last2=Longo |first2=Bernadette M. |last3=Baxter |first3=Kimberly |last4=Boutté |first4=Marie |journal=[[The Journal for Nurse Practitioners]] |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=98–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some studies demonstrated no significant acute changes in lung function among people with [[asthma]] related to PM from wildfires, a possible explanation for these counterintuitive findings is the increased use of [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]], such as inhalers, in response to elevated levels of smoke among those already diagnosed with [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=Colleen E.|last2=Brauer|first2=Michael|last3=Johnston|first3=Fay H.|last4=Jerrett|first4=Michael|last5=Balmes|first5=John R.|last6=Elliott|first6=Catherine T.|date=2016-04-15|title=Critical Review of Health Impacts of Wildfire Smoke Exposure|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|language=en|volume=124|issue=9|pages=1334–43|doi=10.1289/ehp.1409277|issn=0091-6765|pmc=5010409|pmid=27082891}}&lt;/ref&gt; In investigating the association of medication use for obstructive lung disease and wildfire exposure, researchers found increases both in the usage of inhalers and initiation of long-term control as in oral steroids.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; More specifically, some people with [[asthma]] reported higher use of [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]] (inhalers).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; After two major wildfires in California, researchers found an increase in physician prescriptions for [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]] in the years following the wildfires than compared to the year before each occurrence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; 

There is consistent evidence between wildfire smoke and the exacerbation of asthma.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Carbon monoxide danger ===
{{Main|Carbon monoxide poisoning}}
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that can be found at the highest concentration at close proximity to a smoldering fire. For this reason, carbon monoxide inhalation is a serious threat to the health of wildfire firefighters. CO in smoke can be inhaled into the lungs where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and reduces oxygen delivery to the body's vital organs. At high concentrations, it can cause headache, weakness, dizziness, confusion, nausea, disorientation, visual impairment, coma and even death. However, even at lower concentrations, such as those found at wildfires, individuals with cardiovascular disease may experience chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"/&gt;  A recent study tracking the number and cause of wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990–2006 found that 21.9% of the deaths occurred from heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Wildfire Coordinating Group|date=June 2007|title=Wildland firefighter fatalities in the United States 1990–2006|publisher=NWCG Safety and Health Working Team|url=http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms841/pms841_all-72dpi.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315081248/http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms841/pms841_all-72dpi.pdf|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important and somewhat less obvious health effect of wildfires is psychiatric diseases and disorders. Both adults and children from countries ranging from the United States and Canada to Greece and Australia who were directly and indirectly affected by wildfires were found by researchers to demonstrate several different mental conditions linked to their experience with the wildfires. These include [[Post-traumatic stress disorder among athletes|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[Depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, and [[Phobia|phobias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21957753 |date=2011 |last1=Papanikolaou |first1=V |last2=Adamis |first2=D |last3=Mellon |first3=RC |last4=Prodromitis |first4=G |title=Psychological distress following wildfires disaster in a rural part of Greece: A case-control population-based study |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=11–26 |journal=International Journal of Emergency Mental Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jts.20411 |title=Locus of control and psychopathology in relation to levels of trauma and loss: Self-reports of Peloponnesian wildfire survivors |date=2009 |last1=Mellon |first1=Robert C. |last2=Papanikolau |first2=Vasiliki |last3=Prodromitis |first3=Gerasimos |journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=189–96 |pmid=19452533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.58.4.509 |title=Psychiatric Disorders Among Adults Seeking Emergency Disaster Assistance After a Wildland-Urban Interface Fire |date=2007 |last1=Marshall |first1=G.

In a new twist to wildfire health effects, former uranium mining sites were burned over in the summer of 2012 near North Fork, Idaho. This prompted concern from area residents and Idaho State Department of Environmental Quality officials over the potential spread of radiation in the resultant smoke, since those sites had never been completely cleaned up from radioactive remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Idaho Wildfire: Radiation Raises Slight Concern As Blaze Hits Former Uranium, Gold Mines|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/idaho-wildfire-2012-radiation_n_1902414.html|publisher=Huffington Post|first=Jessica|last=Leader|date=21 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926021734/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/idaho-wildfire-2012-radiation_n_1902414.html|archivedate=26 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epidemiology ===
The western US has seen an increase in both frequency and intensity of wildfires over the last several decades. This increase has been attributed to the arid climate of the western US and the effects of global warming. An estimated 46 million people were exposed to wildfire smoke from 2004 to 2009 in the Western United States. Evidence has demonstrated that wildfire smoke can increase levels of particulate matter in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The EPA has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air, through the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and monitoring of ambient air quality has been mandated.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pm/s_pm_index.html|title=Particulate Matter (PM) Standards|date=April 24, 2016|publisher=EPA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815125540/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pm/s_pm_index.html|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these monitoring programs and the incidence of several large wildfires near populated areas, epidemiological studies have been conducted and demonstrate an association between human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke.

The EPA has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards are part of the Clean Air Act and provide mandated guidelines for pollutant levels and the monitoring of ambient air quality.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; In addition to these monitoring programs, the increased incidence of wildfires near populated areas have precipitated several epidemiological studies. Such studies have demonstrated an association between negative human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke. The size of the particulate matter is significant as smaller particulate matter (fine) is easily inhaled into the human respiratory tract. Often, small particulate matter can be inhaled into deep lung tissue causing respiratory distress, illness, or disease.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

An increase in PM smoke emitted from the Hayman fire in Colorado in June 2002, was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2004.11.030 |title=Wildfire smoke and respiratory symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |date=2005 |last1=Sutherland |first1=E.

While the size of particulate matter is an important consideration for health effects, the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) from wildfire smoke should also be considered. Antecedent studies have demonstrated that the chemical composition of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; from wildfire smoke can yield different estimates of human health outcomes as compared to other sources of smoke.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Health outcomes for people exposed to wildfire smoke may differ from those exposed to smoke from alternative sources such as solid fuels.

'''Zond 6''', a formal member of the Soviet [[Zond program]] and unmanned version of [[Soyuz 7K-L1]] manned moon-flyby spacecraft, was launched on a lunar flyby mission from a parent satellite (68-101B) in Earth parking orbit. The spacecraft, which carried scientific probes including [[cosmic ray]] and [[micrometeoroid]] detectors, photography equipment, and a biological payload, was a precursor to a manned circumlunar flight which the Soviets hoped could occur in December 1968, beating the American ''[[Apollo 8]]''. However, after orbiting the Moon Zond 6 crashed on its return to Earth due to a parachute failure.

==Mission==
Zond 6 was the official designation for [[Soyuz 7K-L1]] s/n 12. It was supposed to photograph the Moon in colour and in black and white from 8000&amp;nbsp;km and 2600&amp;nbsp;km ranges, then return to Earth, landing at [[Tyuratam]] only 16&amp;nbsp;km from the launch pad. It had been a long and difficult road to develop the L1 guidance system, but it worked perfectly that time.

Zond 6 flew around the Moon on 14 November 1968, at a minimum distance of 2420&amp;nbsp;km. Photographs of the lunar near side and far side were obtained with [[panchromatic film]]. Each photo was {{convert|5|by|7|in|mm|abbr=on}}. Some of the views allowed for stereo pictures. The photos were taken from distances of approximately 11,000&amp;nbsp;km and 3300&amp;nbsp;km. However, only one negative was recovered from the camera container.

Zond 6 used a relatively uncommon technique called "[[skip reentry]]" to shed velocity upon returning to Earth. A few hours before reentry, on 17 November 1968, a faulty [[O-ring]] rubber gasket caused the cabin to depressurise, killing all the animal test subjects aboard. Zond 6's parachutes also deployed too early and it crashed in Kazakhstan, near the designated landing area.

For propaganda reasons the Soviets claimed the flight was a success. A State Commission investigating the crash later determined that the coronal discharge effect which caused the parachute to jettison would only occur at the 25&amp;nbsp;mm capsule pressure. If the capsule had been completely depressurised to a high vacuum, the accident would not have occurred.

* Launch Date/Time: 1968-11-10 at 19:11:31 UTC
* On-orbit dry mass: 5375&amp;nbsp;kg
