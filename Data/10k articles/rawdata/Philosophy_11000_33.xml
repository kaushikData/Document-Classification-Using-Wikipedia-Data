'''''A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy''''' is a book by [[Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade]], also known as Gurudev Ranade, who was an eminent scholar of the [[Upanishads]] who specialised in [[Greek philosophy]] and emphasized the centrality of a psychological approach as opposed to a theological approach for the proper understanding of the [[Brahman|Ultimate Reality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nalini Bhushan |author2=Jay L. Garfield |title=Indian Philosophy in English: From Renaissance to Independence |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ebo8NpbpNk0C&amp;pg=PA245 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-991128-8 |page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was first published in 1926 by Oriental Books Agency, [[Pune]], under the patronage of Sir Parashuramarao Bhausaheb, Raja of [[Jamkhandi State|Jamkhandi]]. It was later republished by [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]], [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jashan P.

Ranade wrote the book on the basis of his various lectures on Upanishads and the [[Bhagavad Gita]] that were delivered in 1915. In that year, inspired by a lecture of Sir Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, he had first conceived the idea of a presentation of Upanishadic philosophy in terms of modern thought. He took into consideration of the place of the Upanishads in Indian philosophy, and examined the opinions of the Orientalists with a view to put into hand of the Orientalists and those interested a new method for treating the problems of Indian philosophy, and into the hands of European philosophers a new material for exercising their intellects on, to serve the main intended spiritual purpose. He employed "the method of construction through a systematic exposition of all the problems that emerge from the discussion of Upanishadic thought in their manifold bearings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R.D.Ranade |title=Preface to A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sE8pAAAAYAAJ| edition = 1968 |year=1968 |publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |pages=vii-xix |location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is broadly divided into seven chapters. First he deals with the background of Upanishadic Speculation, then with the development of Upanishadic Cosmogony. He discusses the varieties of psychological reflection and the roots of later philosophies, before taking up the problem of the Ultimate Reality in the Upanishads. He covers the ethics of the Upanishads, and finally the intimation of self-realisation.

{{Anthroposophy}}
'''Anthroposophic medicine''' (or '''anthroposophical medicine''') is a form of [[alternative medicine]].&lt;ref name=teils/&gt; Devised in the 1920s by [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861–1925) in conjunction with [[Ita Wegman]] (1876–1943), anthroposophical medicine is based on [[occult]] notions and draws on Steiner's [[spiritual philosophy]], which he called [[anthroposophy]]. Practitioners employ a variety of treatment techniques based upon anthroposophic precepts, including [[massage]], exercise, [[Counseling psychology|counselling]], and [[Anthroposophic pharmacy|substances]].&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt;

Many drug preparations used in anthroposophic medicine are ultra-diluted substances, similar to those used in [[homeopathy]]. Homeopathic remedies are not medically effective and are generally considered harmless, except when used as a substitute for a scientifically proven and effective cure.&lt;ref name=krit/&gt; In certain European countries, people with [[cancer]] are sometimes prescribed remedies made from specially harvested [[mistletoe]], but research has found no convincing [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence]] of clinical benefit.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt;&lt;ref name="coch-2010"/&gt; Some anthroposophic doctors oppose childhood [[vaccination]], and this has led to preventable outbreaks of disease.&lt;ref name=measles/&gt;

Anthroposophic medicine departs from fundamental biological principles in several respects. For example, Steiner said that the [[heart]] does not [[pump]] [[blood]] but that blood propels itself along.&lt;ref name=Marinelli/&gt; Anthroposophic medicine also proposes that patients' [[past lives]] may influence their illness&lt;ref name=qw/&gt; and that the course of an illness is subject to [[karmic]] destiny.&lt;ref name=deadly/&gt; Professor of complementary medicine [[Edzard Ernst]] and other physicians and scientists including [[Simon Singh]] and [[David Gorski]] have characterized anthroposophic medicine as [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[quackery]]&lt;ref name=seop/&gt;&lt;ref name="thes-aberdeen"/&gt; with no basis in reason or logic.&lt;ref name=mckie/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gorski&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gorski |first1=David |title=A University of Michigan Medical School alumnus confronts anthroposophic medicine at his alma mater |url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-university-of-michigan-medical-school-alumnus-confronts-anthroposophic-medicine-at-his-alma-mater/ |website=Science-Based Medicine |accessdate=29 November 2018 |date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ShermerEncyclopedia&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shermer |first1=Michael |title=The Skeptic encyclopedia of pseudoscience |date=2002 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1576076539 |page=903 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA869&amp;lpg=PA869&amp;dq=dan+dugan+anthroposophy |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghBook"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Simon |title=Trick or treatment : the undeniable facts about alternative medicine |date=2009 |publisher=W.W.

===History===
[[File:Ita Wegman vor1900.jpg|thumb|200px|Ita Wegman, co-founder of the medical approach, before 1900 in Berlin.]]
The first steps towards an anthroposophic approach to [[medicine]] were made before 1920, when homeopathic physicians and pharmacists began working with Rudolf Steiner, who recommended new [[Anthroposophic Pharmacy|medicinal substances]] as well as specific methods for preparation along with an anthroposophic concept of man. In 1921, Ita Wegman opened the first anthroposophic medical [[clinic]], now known as the Klinik Arlesheim,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klinik-arlesheim.ch Ita Wegman Klinik] (German). Accessed 2007-12-26.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Arlesheim]], [[Switzerland]]. Wegman was soon joined by a number of other doctors. They then began to train the first anthroposophic [[nurse]]s for the clinic.

At Wegman's request, Steiner regularly visited the clinic and suggested treatment regimes for particular patients. Between 1920 and 1925, he also gave several series of lectures on medicine. In 1925, Wegman and Steiner wrote the first book on the anthroposophic approach to medicine, ''Fundamentals of Therapy''.

Wegman later opened a separate clinic and curative home in [[Ascona]]. Wegman lectured widely, visiting the [[Netherlands]] and [[England]] particularly frequently, and an increasing number of doctors began to include the anthroposophic approach in their practices. A cancer clinic, the Lukas Clinic, opened in Arlesheim in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lukasklinik.ch/cms.asp?IDN=133&amp;H='106'&amp;T=0&amp;Sprache=en Lukas Clinic]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630090414/http://www.lukasklinik.ch/cms.asp?IDN=133&amp;H=%27106%27&amp;T=0&amp;Sprache=en |date=June 30, 2006 }}. Accessed 2007-12-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 anthroposophic medicine in [[Germany]] got regulated by [[law]] as a specific therapeutic system ("Besondere Therapierichtung") by the Medicines Act-Arzneimittelgesetz (AMG) and by the Code of Social Law (Sozialgesetzbuch V)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nafkam-lovgivning.uit.no/anthroposophic-medicine-in-germany/ | title=Anthroposophic medicine in Germany | accessdate=2015-09-21 | date=2012-12-31 | work= NAFKAM's website on the regulation of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in 39 European/EU countries | publisher=NAFKAM }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s the [[Witten/Herdecke University]] in Germany established a [[Chair (academia)|chair]] in anthroposophical medicine. The [[News media|press]] described the appointment as a "death sentence" and the perception that pseudoscience was being taught damaged the [[university]]'s reputation, bringing it close to financial collapse.

In 2012 the [[University of Aberdeen]] considered establishing a chair in [[holistic health]] jointly funded by Software AG, and by the Anthroposophic Health, Education, and Social Care Movement, each of which would provide £1.5 million of endowment.&lt;ref name=mckie/&gt; [[Edzard Ernst]] commented "that any decent university should even consider an anthroposophical medicine unit seems incomprehensible. The fact that it would be backed by people who have a financial interest in this bogus approach makes it even worse."&lt;ref name=mckie/&gt; The University's governance and nominations committee eventually decided not to proceed with the appointment.&lt;ref name="thes-aberdeen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jump|first=Paul|date=11 May 2012|title=Aberdeen decides against alternative medicine chair|journal=Times Higher Education Supplement|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/419909.article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categorization and conceptual basis===
The categorization of anthroposophical medicine is complex since in part it complements conventional medicine, and in part it substitutes for it.&lt;ref name=teils&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1159/000093481|title=Anthroposophische Medizin: Health Technology Assessment Bericht – Kurzfassung|year=2006|last1=Kienle|first1=Gunver S.|last2=Kiene|first2=Helmut|last3=Albonico|first3=Hans Ulrich|journal=Forschende Komplementärmedizin|volume=13|issue=2|pages=7–18|quote=teils ergänzend und teils ersetzend zur konventionellen Medizin}} ''Cited in'' {{cite journal|pmid=18540325|year=2008|last1=Ernst|first1=E|title=Anthroposophic medicine: A critical analysis|volume=150 Suppl 1|pages=1–6|journal=MMW Fortschritte der Medizin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ernst wrote that it was being promoted as an "extension to conventional medicine".&lt;ref name=measles/&gt;

Ernst writes that Steiner used imagination and insight as a basis for his ideas, drawing mystical knowledge from the occult [[Akashic Records]], a work which is supposedly situated on the [[astral plane]], and which Steiner said was accessible to him via his intuitive powers.&lt;ref name=krit/&gt; On this basis, Steiner proposed "associations between four postulated dimensions of the human body (physical body, etheric body, astral body, and ego), plants, minerals, and the cosmos".&lt;ref name=ernstmist&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.39055.493958.80|title=Mistletoe as a treatment for cancer|year=2006|last1=Ernst|first1=E.|journal=BMJ|volume=333|issue=7582|pages=1282–3|pmid=17185706|pmc=1761165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner also proposed a connection betweens planets, metals and organs so that, for example, the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the element [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and the lung were all somehow associated. These propositions form the basis of anthroposophical medicine.&lt;ref name=krit/&gt;

Ernst has said that anthroposophical medicine "includes some of the least plausible theories one could possibly imagine",&lt;ref name=vatican&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.2042-7166.2007.tb04893.x|title=Anthroposophic Medicine|year=2010|last1=Ernst|first1=E|journal=Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies|volume=12|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; categorized it as "pure quackery",&lt;ref name="thes-aberdeen"/&gt; and said that it "has no basis in science".&lt;ref name=mckie/&gt; According to [[Quackwatch]], anthroposophical medicine practitioners regard illness as a "rite of passage" necessary to purge spiritual impurities carried over from past lives, according to the precepts of "karmic destiny".&lt;ref name=qw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/steiner.html|title=Rudolf Steiner's Quackery|last=Rawlings|first=Roger|publisher=[[QuackWatch]]|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

In [[anthroposophic pharmacy]] drugs are prepared according to ancient notions of [[alchemy]] and [[homeopathy]] which are not related to the science underlying modern [[pharmacology]].&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt; During the preparation process, patterns formed by crystallization are interpreted to see which "etheric force" they most closely resemble.&lt;ref name=seop&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan|last=Dugan|editor=Michael Shermer|title=Anthroposophy and Anthroposophical Medicine|work=The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA31|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-653-8|pages=31–32|date=2002-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most anthroposophic preparations are highly diluted, like homeopathic remedies. This means that, while they are completely harmless in themselves, using them in place of conventional medicine to treat serious illness carries a risk of severe adverse consequences.&lt;ref name=krit&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18540325|year=2008|last1=Ernst|first1=E|title=Anthroposophic medicine: A critical analysis|volume=150 Suppl 1|pages=1–6|journal=MMW Fortschritte der Medizin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as drug remedies, anthroposophical medicine also includes:&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt;

===Plant-derived treatments===
To select an anthroposophic substance for a particular illness, practitioners consider the source of the substances used. The character of a mineral, plant or animal is hypothesised to have been formed by the substances that are most active within it, in the belief that this character may also influence what the substance will accomplish when given to treat another organism. This is related to [[Samuel Hahnemann]]'s [[Doctrine of signatures]]. Willow, for example, is considered to have an unusual character:
{{Quote|... plants that grow near water are usually heavy, with big, dark green leaves that wilt and break easily. An exception is ... the white willow, a tree that always grows near water and loves light. However, unlike other "watery" plants, the willow has fine, almost dry leaves and looks very light ...  Its branches are unbelievably tough. They are elastic and cannot be broken. They bend easily and form "joints" rather than break. These few signatures can give us the clue to what salix can be used for therapeutically: arthritis, deformation of joints, swollen joints ...&lt;ref name=rob&gt;{{cite web

There is no scientific evidence that the shape of plants has ever caused a new medical property to be discovered.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=Bradley C. |year=2007 |title= Doctrine of Signatures: An Explanation of Medicinal Plant Discovery or Dissemination of Knowledge? |journal=Economic Botany |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=246–255 |url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1663%2F0013-0001(2007)61%5B246%3ADOSAEO%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |quote= |doi=10.1663/0013-0001(2007)61[246:DOSAEO]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart===
Steiner described the heart not as a [[pump]], but as a regulator of flow, such that the heartbeat itself can be distinguished from the circulation of blood.&lt;ref name=Marinelli/&gt;&lt;ref name="jarvis"&gt;William T. Jarvis [http://www.ncahf.org/articles/a-b/anthro.html Anthroposophical Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; Anthroposophic medicine claims the flow in the [[blood]] of the [[circulatory system]] is, as Marinelli put it, ''"propelled with its own biological momentum, as can be seen in the embryo, and boosts itself with ''induced'' momenta from the [[heart]]"''.&lt;ref name=Marinelli&gt;Marinelli, R., Fuerst, B., et al. [http://www.rsarchive.org/RelArtic/Marinelli/ "The Heart is not a Pump: A refutation of the pressure propulsion premise of heart function"], ''Frontier Perspectives'' 5(1), Fall-Winter 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Branko|title=The Heart and Circulation|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4471-5277-4|url=|ref=furst2014|oclc=868250054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of the heart is not based on any scientific theory and has been characterized as "crank science".&lt;ref name="jarvis"/&gt;

===Mistletoe treatment for cancer===

{{See also|List of unproven and disproven cancer treatments}}
Rudolf Steiner hypothesised that mistletoe could cure cancer, on the basis of the observation that the plant was a parasite which eventually killed its host, a process which he claimed paralleled the progression of cancer.&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt; Steiner believed the plant's medical potential was influenced by the position of the sun, moon and planets and that it therefore was important to harvest the plant at the right time.&lt;ref name=Olson2005&gt;{{cite book|author=James S. Olson|title=Bathsheba's Breast: Women, Cancer, and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gp9aMBieClMC&amp;pg=PA452|accessdate=1 September 2013|date=5 January 2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8064-3|page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mistletoe preparations are ultra-diluted; others are made from fermented mistletoe.&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt;  The most commonly used trade names for mistletoe drugs are Iscador and Helixor.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt;

Although [[in vitro|laboratory]] experiments have suggested that mistletoe extract may affect the [[immune system]] and be able to kill some kinds of cancer cells, there is little [[evidence-based medicine|evidence]] of its benefit to people with cancer.&lt;ref name="coch-2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horneber MA, Bueschel G, Huber R, Linde K, Rostock M |title=Mistletoe therapy in oncology |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD003297 |year=2008 |pmid=18425885 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003297.pub2 |type=Systematic review|quote=The review found that there was not enough evidence to reach clear conclusions about the effects on any of these outcomes and it is therefore not clear to what extent the application of mistletoe extracts translates into improved symptom control, enhanced tumour response or prolonged survival.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cancer.gov"/&gt; Most of the clinical research claiming that mistletoe therapy is effective is published in Germany, and it is generally considered unreliable because of major lapses in quality.&lt;ref name="cancer.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/mistletoe-pdq#section/_2 |title=Questions and Answers About Mistletoe |publisher=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=3 December 2015 |date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=xmas/&gt; Edzard Ernst wrote that research by anthroposophic doctors often reached positive conclusions on mistletoe therapy because it drew on unreliable material; independent researchers tended instead to find no evidence of benefit.&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt; The [[American Cancer Society]] says that "available evidence from well-designed clinical trials does not support claims that mistletoe can improve length or quality of life".&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |work=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editor=Ades TB |pages=424–428 |title=Mistletoe |quote=Available evidence from well-designed clinical trials does not support claims that mistletoe can improve length or quality of life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistletoe-based cancer drugs are widely used in Europe, especially in German-speaking countries.&lt;ref name=xmas/&gt; In 2002 nearly half a million prescriptions were paid for by German health insurance and in 2006 there were reportedly around 30 types of mistletoe extract on the market.&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt;&lt;ref name=xmas/&gt;  Mistletoe extracts have been used as an unconventional treatment for cancer patients in the [[Netherlands]], and in Germany the treatment has been approved as [[palliative therapy]] to treat the symptoms of patients with malignant tumors.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt; In Sweden, controversially, mistletoe therapy has been approved for use in the treatment of cancer symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://svenskfarmaci.se/lakemedel/unikt-klartecken-for-antroposofiskt-lakemedel/ "Unique green light for anthroposophical drug"], ''Svensk Farmaci''&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries mistletoe therapy is virtually unknown.&lt;ref name=xmas/&gt; The [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] has not approved mistletoe-based drugs for any purpose; mistletoe extracts may not be distributed in or imported into the US except for research purposes.&lt;ref name="cancer.gov"/&gt; {{asof|2015}}  no mistletoe-based drugs are licensed for use in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=ukmi&gt;{{citation |author=Johnson H |publisher=UK Medicines Information |title=What is the evidence for subcutaneous mistletoe extract in the treatment of cancer? |date=2 January 2015 |url=http://www.medicinesresources.nhs.uk/GetDocument.aspx?pageId=777217 |format=doc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208125032/http://www.medicinesresources.nhs.uk/GetDocument.aspx?pageId=777217 |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 article on mistletoe in ''[[The Lancet#Specialty journals|Lancet Oncology]]'' invoked [[Ben Goldacre]]'s observation that a geographical preference for certain therapies was a hallmark of [[quackery]], and proposed that the continuing use of this "apparently ineffectual therapy" in a small cluster of countries was based on [[sociological]] rather than medical reasons, indicating a need for a more informed [[Informed consent|consent]] from patients.&lt;ref name=xmas&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Giorgio A, Stebbing J |title=Mistletoe: for cancer or just for Christmas? |journal=Lancet Oncol. |volume=14 |issue=13 |pages=1264–5 |year=2013 |pmid=24275128 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70560-6 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immunization==
{{see also|Vaccine controversies}}

The risks arising from using anthroposophical medicine as a substitute for [[evidence-based medicine]] are exemplified by several cases of low vaccination levels in [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]],&lt;ref name=krit/&gt; since some anthroposophical doctors oppose [[immunization]].&lt;ref name=measles&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21102363|year=2011|last1=Ernst|first1=E|title=Anthroposophy: A risk factor for noncompliance with measles immunization|volume=30|issue=3|pages=187–9|doi=10.1097/INF.0b013e3182024274|journal=The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal |quote=Anthroposophic medicine was founded by Steiner and Ita Wegman in the early 20th century. Currently, it is being promoted as an extension of conventional medicine. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1999 study of children in Sweden showed that in [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]], only 18% had received [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] vaccination, compared to a level of 93% in other schools nationally.&lt;ref name=krit/&gt;

A 2003 report of a widespread measles outbreak around [[Coburg]], Germany, identified a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]] as the origin.&lt;ref name=krit/&gt; At the time the town's mayor had condemned homeopathic doctors who had discouraged vaccination, saying "Their stronghold is the Waldorf School, which actively encourages people not to have their children vaccinated. Now we have an epidemic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Offit]] writes that Steiner believed vaccination "interferes with karmic development and the cycles of reincarnation", and that adherence to this belief led to a 2008 [[pertussis]] outbreak in a Californian [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]], causing its temporary closure.&lt;ref name=deadly&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul A.

'''Arto Haapala''' (born 1959) is a Finnish philosopher, aesthetician and Professor of [[Aesthetics]] at the Department of Philosophy, History, Culture and Art Studies at [[Helsinki University]], [[Finland]]. Haapala received his PhD from [[Birkbeck, University of London]] in 1985. He is also active in the work of the [[Finnish Society for Aesthetics]] and the [[International Institute of Applied Aesthetics]] in [[Lahti]], Finland.

In addition to aesthetics,&lt;ref name="Gracyk2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gracyk|first=Theodore|title=Listening to Popular Music, or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Led Zeppelin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=deweKVG-ZAEC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=27 February 2011|year=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-06983-5|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haapala also specialises in hermeneutics, especially the philosophy of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

{{Hypnosis}}
'''Autosuggestion''' is a psychological technique related to the [[placebo effect]], developed by [[apothecary]] [[Émile Coué]] at the beginning of the 20th century. It is a form of self-induced [[suggestion]] in which individuals guide their own thoughts, feelings, or behavior. The technique is often used in [[self-hypnosis]].

==Typological distinctions==
[[Émile Coué]] identified two very different types of self-suggestion:
* intentional, "''reflective autosuggestion''": made by deliberate and conscious effort, and
* unintentional, "''spontaneous auto-suggestion''": which is a "natural phenomenon of our mental life … which takes place without conscious effort [and has its effect] with an intensity proportional to the keenness of [our] attention".&lt;ref&gt;Baudouin (1920), pp.33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to Coué's group of "spontaneous auto-suggestions", his student [[Charles Baudouin]] (1920, p.&amp;nbsp;41) made three further useful distinctions, based upon the sources from which they came:
* "Instances belonging to the representative domain&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(sensations, mental images, dreams, visions, memories, opinions, and all intellectual phenomena)."
* "Instances belonging to the affective domain&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(joy or sorrow, emotions, sentiments, tendencies, passions)."

Émile Coué, who had both B.A. and B.Sc. degrees before he was 21, graduated top of his class (with First Class Honours) with a degree in pharmacology from the prestigious [[Collège Sainte-Barbe]] in Paris in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Yeates (2016a), pp.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Having spent an additional six months as an intern at the [[Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital]] in Paris, he returned to Troyes, where he worked as an [[apothecary]] from 1882 to 1910.&lt;ref&gt;See Yeates, 2016a, 2016b, and 2016c.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Hypnosis" à la Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault and Hippolyte Bernheim===
In 1885, his investigations of [[hypnosis|hypnotism]] and the power of the [[imagination]] began with [[Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault]] and [[Hippolyte Bernheim]], two leading exponents of "''hypnosis''",&lt;ref&gt;As distinct from Braid's '''hypnotism''', Liébeault and Bernheim's '''hypnosis''' "used a laborious, monotonous, 'sleep, sleep, sleep' hypnotic induction — thus, his inappropriate, misleading, and ambiguous term ‘hypnosis’ — to produce [what Bernheim called] a “''charme''” (‘spellbound’) state" (Yeates, 2016a, pp.11-12).&lt;/ref&gt; of Nancy, with whom he studied in 1885 and 1886 (having taken leave from his business in Troyes). Following this training, "he dabbled with ‘hypnosis’ in Troyes in 1886, but soon discovered that their Liébeault's techniques were hopeless, and abandoned ‘hypnosis’ altogether".&lt;ref name="ONE"&gt;Yeates, 2016a, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypnotism à la James Braid and Xenophon LaMotte Sage===
In 1901, Coué sent to the United States for a free book, ''Hypnotism as It is'' (i.e., Sage, 1900a),&lt;ref&gt;Given that Coué could read Latin and was fluent in both German and English meant that an English language book presented no difficulty.&lt;/ref&gt; which purported to disclose "secrets [of the] science that brings business and social success" and "the hidden mysteries of personal magnetism, hypnotism, magnetic healing, etc.". Deeply impressed by its contents, he purchased the French language version of the associated correspondence course (i.e., Sage, 1900b, and 1900c),&lt;ref&gt;It is significant that the career of the French [[Parapsychology|parapsychologist]] [[Michel Moine#The parapsychologist and the journalist : two careers in parallel|Michel Moine]] also began with Sage's course.&lt;/ref&gt; created by  stage hypnotist extraordinaire, "''Professor Xenophon LaMotte Sage,  A.M., Ph.D., LL.D., of Rochester, New York''" (who had been admitted into the prestigious ''Medico-Legal Society of New York'' in 1899).

In real life, Xenophon LaMotte Sage was none other than Ewing Virgil Neal (1868-1949), the multi-millionaire, [[Calligraphy|calligrapher]], [[Stage hypnosis|hypnotist]], publisher, [[advertising]]/[[marketing]] pioneer (he launched the career of [[Carl R. Byoir]]), pharmaceutical manufacturer, parfumier, international businessman, confidant of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], Commandatore of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]], Officer of the [[Legion of Honour]], and fugitive from justice, who moved to France in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;See Conroy (2014), passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sage's course supplied the missing piece of the puzzle — namely, Braid-style hypnotic inductions — the solution for which had, up to that time, eluded Coué: 
::&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Coué immediately recognised that the course’s Braid-style of hypnotism was ideal for ''mental therapeutics''. He undertook an intense study, and was soon skilled enough to offer hypnotism alongside his pharmaceutical enterprise. In the context of Liébeault’s ‘hypnosis’, Braid’s hypnotism, and Coué’s (later) discoveries about autosuggestion, one must recognise the substantially different orientations of Liébeault’s "''suggestive therapeutics''", which concentrated on imposing the coercive power of the operator’s suggestion, and Braid’s "''psycho-physiology''", which concentrated on activating the transformative power of the subject’s mind."&lt;ref&gt;Yeates (2016a), p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more on Braid's overarching conceptualization, "''psycho-physiology''" — "the whole of [those] phenomena which result from the reciprocal actions of mind and matter upon each other" — see Braid (1855), p.855.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had abandoned Liébeault's "''hypnosis''" in 1886, he adopted Braid's ''hypnotism'' in 1901; and, in fact, in addition to, and (often) separate from, his auto-suggestive practices, Coué actively used Braid's hypnotism for the rest of his professional life.&lt;ref&gt;Baudouin (1920), pp.257-258; Orton (1955), p.48; Yeates (2016a, 2016b, 2016c).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggestion and Auto-suggestion===
Coué was so deeply impressed by Bernheim's concept of “suggestive therapeutics” — in effect, "an imperfect re-branding of the ‘dominant idea’ theory that [[James Braid (surgeon)|Braid]] had appropriated from [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]]"&lt;ref name="ONE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more on Brown and "dominant ideas", see Yeates (2016b), pp.30-35.&lt;/ref&gt; — that, on his return to Troyes from his (1886-1886) interlude with Liébeault and Bernheim, he made a practice of reassuring his clients by praising each remedy's [[Efficacy#Medicine|efficacy]]. He noticed that, in specific cases, he could increase a medicine's efficacy by praising its effectiveness. He realized that, when compared those to whom he said nothing, those to whom he praised the medicine had a noticeable improvement (this is suggestive of what would later be identified as a "''[[placebo effect|placebo response]]''").
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Around 1903, Coué recommended a new patent medicine, based on its promotional material, which effected an unexpected and immediate cure (Baudouin, 1920, p.90; Shrout, 1985, p.36). Coué (the chemist) found “[by subsequent] chemical analysis in his laboratory [that there was] nothing in the medicine which by the remotest stretch of the imagination accounted for the results” (Shrout, ibid.). Coué (the hypnotist) concluded that it was cure by suggestion; but, rather than Coué having cured him, the man had cured himself by ''continuously telling himself the same thing that Coué had told him''."&lt;ref&gt;Yeates (2016c), p.63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The birth of "Conscious Autosuggestion"==
Coué discovered that subjects could not be hypnotized against their will and, more importantly, that the effects of hypnotic suggestion waned when the subjects regained consciousness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} He thus eventually developed the Coué method, and released his first book, ''Self-Mastery Through Conscious Autosuggestion'' (published in 1920 in England and two years later in the United States). He described autosuggestion itself as:
{{cquote|... an instrument that we possess at birth, and with which we play unconsciously all our life, as a baby plays with its rattle. It is however a dangerous instrument; it can wound or even kill you if you handle it imprudently and unconsciously. It can on the contrary save your life when you know how to employ it consciously.&lt;ref&gt;Coué, E: "Self Mastery Through Conscious Autosuggestion", page 19, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Coué never doubted pharmaceutical medicine, and still advocated its application, he also came to believe that one's mental state could positively affect, and even amplify, the pharmaceutical action of medication. He observed that those patients who used his mantra-like conscious suggestion, "Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better", (French: ''Tous les jours, à tous points de vue, je vais de mieux en mieux''; lit. 'Every day, from all points of view, I'm getting better and better') — in his view, replacing their "thought of illness" with a new "thought of cure", could augment their pharmaceutical regimen in an efficacious way.

===Conceptual difference from Autogenic Training===
By contrast with the conceptualization driving Coué's auto-suggestive self-administration procedure — namely, that constant repetition creates a situation in which "''a particular idea saturates the microcognitive environment of 'the mind'…''", which, then, in its turn, "is converted into a corresponding ideomotor, ideosensory, or ideoaffective action, by the ''ideodynamic principle of action''", "which then, in its turn, generates the response"&lt;ref&gt;Yeates (2016b), pp.39,40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1853,[[Daniel Noble (physician)|Daniel Noble]] suggested that Carpenter's "''[[Ideomotor phenomenon|ideo-motor]]''", restricted to motion alone, was far to too narrow a term, and he advocated the adoption of the term "''ideodynamic''" on the basis that the term "was applicable to a wider range of phenomena" (Noble, 1853, p.71; 1854, p.642). Carpenter and Braid immediately agreed with their friend and colleague, Noble; and from that time, Braid, who had earlier spoken of a "mono-ideo-motor principle of action", continuously spoke of a "mono-ideo-dynamic principle of action" being responsible for the generation of hypnotic phenomena (e.g., Braid, 1855, p.852).&lt;/ref&gt; — the primary target of the entirely different self-administration procedure developed by [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz]], known as ''[[Autogenic Training]]'', was to affect the [[autonomic nervous system]], rather than (as Coué's did) to affect 'the mind'.

==The Coué method==
{{Quote box
 |title =La méthode Coué
 |quote =&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Continuously, unjustly, and mistakenly trivialised as just a hand-clasp, some&lt;br&gt;
unwarranted optimism, and a ‘mantra’, Coué’s ''method'' evolved over several&lt;br&gt;
decades of meticulous observation, theoretical speculation, in-the-field testing,&lt;br&gt;
incremental adjustment, and step-by-step transformation.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It tentatively began (c.1901) with very directive one-to-one hypnotic inter-&lt;br&gt;
ventions, based upon the approaches and techniques that Coué had acquired&lt;br&gt;
from an American correspondence course.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As his theoretical knowledge, clinical experience, understanding of&lt;br&gt;
suggestion and autosuggestion, and hypnotic skills expanded, it gradually&lt;br&gt;
developed into its final subject-centred version—an intricate complex of&lt;br&gt;
(group) education, (group) hypnotherapy, (group) ego-strengthening, and&lt;br&gt;
(group) training in self-suggested pain control; and, following instruction in&lt;br&gt;
performing the prescribed self-administration ritual, the twice daily intentional&lt;br&gt;
and deliberate (individual) application of its unique formula, "Every day, in&lt;br&gt;
every way, I’m getting better and better".&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Yeates (2016c), p.55.

The Coué method centers on a routine repetition of this particular expression according to a specified ritual, in a given physical state, and in the absence of any sort of allied mental imagery, at the beginning and at the end of each day. Coué maintained that curing some of our troubles requires a change in our subconscious/unconscious thought, which can only be achieved by using our imagination. Although stressing that he was not primarily a healer but one who taught others to heal themselves, Coué claimed to have affected organic changes through autosuggestion.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;"Émile Coué." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 26 Dec. 2008 [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/140032/Emile-Coue]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underlying principles===
Coué thus developed a method which relied on the belief that ''any idea exclusively occupying the mind turns into reality'',&lt;ref name=anxious&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zXDkMJSS-IC&amp;pg=PT70&amp;lpg=PT70&amp;dq=%22any+idea+exclusively+occupying+the+mind+turns+into+reality%22+%C3%89mile+Cou%C3%A9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zMfqR66403&amp;sig=6QCuUXs6OMq1jtQyePZXuNREXr4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL_oy98_TPAhWJvrwKHVs-Cp8Q6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22any+idea+exclusively+occupying+the+mind+turns+into+reality%22+%C3%89mile+Cou%C3%A9&amp;f=false|title=Anxious in Love: How to Manage Your Anxiety, Reduce Conflict, and Reconnect with Your Partner|first1=Carolyn|last1=Daitch|first2=Lissah|last2=Lorberbaum|date=1 December 2012|publisher=New Harbinger  Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781608822331}}&lt;/ref&gt; although only to the extent that the idea is within the realm of possibility. For instance, a person without hands will not be able to make them grow back. However, if a person firmly believes that his or her asthma is disappearing, then this may actually happen, as far as the body is actually able to physically overcome or control the illness. On the other hand, thinking negatively about the illness (e.g. "I am not feeling well") will encourage both mind and body to accept this thought.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Willpower===
Coué observed that the main obstacle to autosuggestion was [[Self-control|willpower]]. For the method to work, the patient must refrain from making any independent judgement, meaning that he must not let his will impose its own views on positive ideas. Everything must thus be done to ensure that the positive "autosuggestive" idea is consciously ''accepted'' by the patient, otherwise one may end up getting the opposite effect of what is desired.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, C.H., "The practice of autosuggestion", p62, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

Coué noted that young children always applied his method perfectly, as they lacked the willpower that remained present among adults. When he instructed a child by saying "clasp your hands" and then "you can't pull them apart" the child would thus immediately follow his instructions and be unable to unclasp their hands.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

=== Self-conflict ===
Coué believed a patient's problems were likely to increase if his willpower and imagination opposed each other, something Coué referred to as "self-conflict."{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} As the conflict intensifies, so does the problem i.e., the more the patient consciously wants to sleep, the more he becomes awake. The patient must thus abandon his willpower and instead put more focus on his imaginative power in order to fully succeed with his cure.

===Effectiveness===
With his method, which Coué once called his "trick",&lt;ref&gt;Coué, E: "How to Practice Suggestion and Autosuggestion" page 45. "''un truc ou procédé mécanique''" ('a trick, or mechanical process'). Note that when Coué referred to his "trick", he was speaking of the mechanism, or "the secret", that was responsible for the approach's success (as in, say, "the trick to the [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|hook shot]] is …"), he was not speaking of deceiving his subject.&lt;/ref&gt; patients of all sorts would come to visit him. The list of ailments included kidney problems, diabetes, memory loss, stammering, weakness, atrophy and all sorts of physical and mental illnesses.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} According to one of his journal entries (1916), he apparently cured a patient of a [[uterus]] [[prolapse]] as well as "violent pains in the head" ([[migraine]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wallechinsky, David. "Emile Coue (1857-1926) French Healer." The People's Almanac. 2nd Ed. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence===
Advocates of autosuggestion appeal to brief case histories published by Émile Coué describing his use of autohypnosis to cure, for example, enteritis and paralysis from spinal cord injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychomaster.com/books/emile/11.php Self Mastery Through Conscious Autosuggestion:Emile Coue]. Psychomaster.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2015}}

===Autogenic training===
[[Autogenic training]] is an autosuggestion-centered relaxation technique influenced by the Coué method.  In 1932, [[Germany|German]] psychiatrist [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz|Johannes Schultz]] developed and published on autogenic training. Unlike autosuggestion, autogenic training has been proven in clinical trials and, along with other [[relaxation technique]]s, such as [[progressive relaxation]] and [[meditation]], has replaced autosuggestion in therapy. The co-author of Schultz's multi-volume tome on autogenic training, Wolfgang Luthe, was a firm believer that autogenic training was a powerful approach that should only be offered to patients by qualified professionals.  Its effectiveness has been confirmed in several studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stetter F, Kupper S |title=Autogenic training: a meta-analysis of clinical outcome studies |journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=45–98 |date=March 2002 |pmid=12001885 |doi=10.1023/A:1014576505223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ikezuki M, Miyauchi Y, Yamaguchi H, Koshikawa F |title=[Development of Autogenic Training Clinical Effectiveness Scale (ATCES)] |journal=Shinrigaku Kenkyu |volume=72 |issue=6 |pages=475–81 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11977841 |doi=10.4992/jjpsy.72.475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Christian Meditation Community''' (CCMC) is part of the [[World Community for Christian Meditation]] (WCCM), which was founded in 1991 to foster the teachings of [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monk and priest, Fr. [[John Main]], [[Order of Saint Benedict|O.S.B.]] (1926–1982). Fr. Main taught a way of [[Christian meditation]] which he based on parallels he saw between the spiritual practice taught by [[Desert Fathers|Desert Father]] [[John Cassian]] and the meditative practice he had been taught by the [[Swami]] Satyanandain in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = John Main’s Monastic Adventure | work = Fr. Laurence Freeman, O.S.B. | url = http://www.wccm.org/images/JMMonasticAdvent3.htm | accessdate = 16 November 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070108070456/http://www.wccm.org/images/JMMonasticAdvent3.htm | archivedate = 8 January 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Fr. John started a small Benedictine community in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], thus bringing this form of contemplative prayer to Canada. The Canadian Community's national office is located in Montreal.

The current director of the WCCM is Fr. [[Laurence Freeman]], [[Order of Saint Benedict|O.S.B.]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], a student of John Main and a Benedictine monk of the Olivetan Congregation. On July 1, 2009, [[Michaëlle Jean]], [[Governor General of Canada]], announced the appointment of Fr. Freeman as an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Governor General announces 60 new appointments to the Order of Canada | work = Governor General of Canada July 1, 2009 News Release | url = http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=13192 | accessdate =  25 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Community is a "monastery without walls", a family of national communities and emerging communities in over a hundred countries. The foundation of the Community is the local meditation group, which meets weekly in homes, parishes, offices, hospitals, prisons, and colleges. The World and Canadian Communities work closely with many Christian denominations and other faiths.

The Canadian Community sponsors retreats, schools for the training of teachers of meditation, lectures and other programs. A national quarterly spiritual and news publication of the Canadian Community is mailed to members and also available online. Information on current programs, connections to national coordinators and the location of [http://www.meditatio.ca/PeopleLists/GroupList.html meditation groups] can be found on the [http://www.meditatio.ca Community website].

Medio Media is the communication and publishing arm of the World and Canadian Communities and offers a wide range of books, audio and videos to support the practice of meditation.  The online bookstore is at [http://www.mediomedia.org Medio Media].

Fr. [[John Main|Main]] taught the practice and discipline of [[Christian meditation]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sit down. Sit still and upright. Close your eyes lightly. Sit relaxed but alert. Silently, interiorly begin to say a single word. We recommend the prayer phrase [[maranatha]]. Recite it as four syllables of equal length. Ma-ra-na-tha. Listen to it as you say it, gently but continuously. Do not think or imagine anything - spiritual or otherwise. If thoughts and images come, these are distractions at the time of meditation, so keep returning to simply saying the word. Meditate each morning and evening for twenty to thirty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Chromium Embedded Framework''' ('''CEF''') is an open source framework for embedding a [[web browser engine]] based on the [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] core. It allows developers to add [[web browser]] control and implement an [[HTML5]]-based layout GUI in a desktop application or to provide web browser capabilities to a [[software application]] or [[video game|game]], and provides the infrastructure for developers to add HTML rendering and JavaScript to a C++ project. It also comes with [[Language binding|bindings]] for [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Object Pascal|Delphi]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]] / [[Mono (software)|Mono]], [[Visual_Basic|Visual Basic 6.0]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and runs on [[Linux]], [[macOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

==Overview==
There are two versions of Chromium Embedded Framework: CEF 1 and CEF 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Versions – Overview of the CEF architecture.|url=https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/Architecture.md#markdown-header-versions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of CEF 2 was abandoned after the appearance of the Chromium Content API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Content API – The Chromium Projects|url=https://www.chromium.org/developers/content-module/content-api}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEF 1 is a single-process implementation based on the Chromium WebKit API. It is no longer actively developed or supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEF1 Retirement Plan|url=http://www.magpcss.org/ceforum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=10647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEF 3 is a multi-process implementation based on the Chromium Content API and has performance similar to Google Chrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/Architecture.md#markdown-header-cef3 |title=CEF 3 Architecture – CEF wiki pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses asynchronous messaging to communicate between the main application process and one or more render processes ([[Blink (layout engine)|Blink]] + [[V8 (JavaScript engine)|V8]] JavaScript engine). It supports [[PPAPI]] plugins and extensions, both internal (PDF viewer) or externally loadable. 
The single-process run mode is not supported, but still present; currently is being used for debugging purposes only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Single process – Process Models- The Chromium Projects|url=https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models#TOC-Single-process}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEF comes with a sample application called CefClient that is written in [[C++]] using [[WinAPI]], [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], or [[GTK]] (depending on the platform) and contains demos of various features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/1364/cef1/tests/cefclient/?at=1364 |title=CEF Git: 1364/cef1/tests/cefclient/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/tests/cefclient/?at=master |title=CEF Git: master/tests/cefclient/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer versions include a sample application called CefSimple that, along with an accompanying tutorial, show how to create a simple application using CEF 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/Tutorial |title=CefSimple Tutorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentation can be found in the header files located in the "include" directory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/1364/cef1/include/?at=1364 |title=CEF Git: /1364/cef1/include/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/include/?at=master |title=CEF Git: /master/include/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on wiki pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/Home |title=CEF Wiki Pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spotify|Spotify]] maintains [https://www.spotify.com/ro/opensource/ development and stable] branches builds for Linux, Mac and Windows in [[32-bit|32-]] and [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] forms.

==Supported languages==
The base CEF framework includes support for the C and C++ programming languages, but there are external projects that provide bindings for other languages:

'''Courtesy''' (from the word ''courteis'', from the [[12th century]]) is [[gentleness|gentle]] [[politeness]] and [[court (royal)|courtly]] [[manners]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, the behaviour expected of the nobility was compiled in [[courtesy book]]s.

The apex of European courtly culture was reached in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Baroque period]] (i.e. roughly the four centuries spanning 1300–1700). 
The oldest courtesy books date to the 13th century, but they become an influential genre in the 16th, the most influential of them being ''[[The Book of the Courtier|Il Cortegiano]]'' (1508), which not only covered basic [[etiquette]] and [[decorum]] but also provided models of sophisticated [[conversation]] and [[intellectual]] skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQINrHtwNU0C&amp;pg=PA249 |title=The Cambridge guide to literature in English |author=Dominic Head |chapter=courtesy book}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The royal courts of Europe did, of course, persist well into the 18th century (and to some limited extent to the present day), but in the 18th century, the  notion of ''courtesy'' was replaced by that of ''[[galant|gallantry]]'', referring to an ideal emphasizing the display of affected [[Sensitive style|sensitivity]] in direct contrast with the ideals of self-denial and dignified seriousness that were the Baroque norm. 
During the late medieval and early modern period, the bourgeois class tended to emulate the courtly etiquette of their betters. This changed in the 19th century, after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the emergence of a [[middle class]] with its own set of [[bourgeois]] etiquette, which in turn was mocked in the classist theory of [[Marxism]] as ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]''.

The analogue concept in the court culture of [[medieval India]] was known by the [[Sanskrit]] term ''dakṣiṇya'', literally meaning "right-handedness", but as in English ''dexterity'' having a figurative meaning of "apt, clever, appropriate", glossed as  "[[kindness]] and consideration expressed in a [[sophistication|sophisticated]] and [[elegance|elegant]] way".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BKW65Yt65wC&amp;pg=PA135 |title=Courtly culture and political life in early medieval India |author=Daud Ali |chapter=The spirit of courtesy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This spiritual network of people from all walks of life was initiated by Lloyd Arthur Meeker in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Timothy|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature|year=2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishers|location=New York, NY|isbn=1847062733|pages=595|url=http://www.continuumbooks.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundational premise of the network is that human beings' true qualities can only be known as they are expressed in practical daily living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cecil|first=Martin|title=As of a Trumpet|year=1968|publisher=Eden Valley Press|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of Emissaries of Divine Light, as cited in its articles of incorporation, is to assist in the spiritual regeneration of humanity under the inspiration of the divine spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emissaries of Divine Light -- About Us|url=http://emissaries.org/about-us/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meeker saw the work of the Emissaries as an approach to spirituality that transcends physical and mental disciplines, and offers human beings the opportunity to experience their true identity by giving expression to the qualities of spirit that are consonant with their divine nature.&lt;ref name="The Third Sacred School #1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cecil|first=Martin|title=The Third Sacred School|year=1977|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=291–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginnings===
Lloyd Arthur Meeker was born on February 25, 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Duzen|first=Grace|title=The Vibrational Ark|year=1996|publisher=Eden Valley Press|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|pages=1, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meeker had begun to experiment with [[Attunement]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|page=19|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emissaries of Divine Light dates its origin to Meeker’s spiritual awakening on September 16, 1932. On three successive evenings, Meeker had been compelled to write and, as he did so, he experienced a higher spiritual awareness that flowed through him. He reported that he had been looking for a teacher but realized through his awakening that the teacher he sought was within him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Duzen|first=Grace|title=The Vibrational Ark|year=1996|publisher=Eden Valley Press|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeker lectured, taught, and practiced Attunement in various locations in North America from 1929 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|pages=14–28|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote under the pen name Uranda, and he was known to his followers by that name. In 1945 Meeker established his headquarters at Sunrise Ranch, which was a dryland farm at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Duzen|first=Grace|title=The Vibrational Ark|year=1996|publisher=Eden Valley Press|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|pages=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1952 to 1954 he conducted six-month Servers Training School classes at Sunrise Ranch, teaching Attunement and the spiritual understanding behind the practice, as well as practical spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laurence|first=Layne|title=The Spiritual Nature of the Physical Body|year=2006|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-0-1|page=8|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meeker|first=Lloyd A.|title=The Divine Design of Man|year=1952|publisher=Universal Institute of Applied Ontology|location=Loveland, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; These classes were attended by people from many backgrounds, and included GPC (God-Patient-Chiropractor) chiropractors, led by a former Major League Baseball pitcher, [[George Shears]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|pages=19–22|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 Meeker died in a plane crash in San Francisco Bay with his wife, Kathy Meeker. A close associate of Meeker’s, Albert Ackerley, and two children also died in the crash.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sunrise Ranch Cemetery|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/co/larimer/cemeteries/sunrise.txt|publisher=The USGenWeb Project|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Cecil, 7th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Martin Cecil]] (1909-1988), who had worked closely with Meeker, assumed the responsibility for leading Emissaries of Divine Light from 1954 until his death in 1988.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|Lord]] Martin succeeded his [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|older brother]] to become The 7th [[Marquess of Exeter]] in October 1981.

===Development under Lord Martin Cecil's leadership===
[[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|Lord]] Martin Cecil was the second son of [[William Cecil, 5th Marquess of Exeter|The 5th Marquess of Exeter]] and was descended from [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], chief adviser to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Mile House |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/100-mile-house |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Foundation |accessdate=May 15, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Chris|title=One Heart, One Way|year=1989|publisher=Foundation House Publications, Inc.|location=Denver, Colorado|isbn=0-921790-00-7|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led a ranching operation on his family’s property in the [[Cariboo]] country of [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emissaries of Divine Light|url=http://knowbc.com/limited/Books/Encyclopedia-of-BC/E/Emissaries-of-Divine-Light|publisher=Encyclopedia of BC|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Cecil formed a spiritual community at [[100 Mile House, British Columbia|100 Mile House]], BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Religious Movements|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/new-religious-movements|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the death of his brother, [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|The 6th Marquess of Exeter]], in October 1981, he became The 7th [[Marquess of Exeter]] and a member of the [[House of Lords]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. However, he never spoke in the House.&lt;ref&gt;http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-william-cecil-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Lord Martin's leadership, the network grew to about 4,000 adherents.&lt;ref name="Pitzer1997" /&gt; Many young people, disenchanted with the Vietnam War and inspired by the idealism of the 1960s and ’70s, were drawn to his message and the network that was growing around him. Twelve centers developed around the world, and numerous other nonprofit organizations were birthed by participants in Emissaries of Divine Light.&lt;ref name="ic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Starrs |first=Tom |title=Rhythms of Home: Perspectives on a Communal Lifestyle |url=http://www.ic.org/pnp/cdir/1995/26starrs.php |publisher=Fellowship for Intentional Community |accessdate=May 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712180048/http://www.ic.org/pnp/cdir/1995/26starrs.php |archivedate=July 12, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These included an outdoor adventure educational organization, Educo; an association of spiritually based business people, Renaissance Business Associates; an association of media professionals, Association for Responsible Communication; an association of educators, Renaissance Educational Associates; and Emissary Foundation International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Duzen|first=Grace|title=The Vibrational Ark|year=1996|publisher=Eden Valley Press|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Educo International Alliance |url=http://www.educoadventures.org/eia.asp |publisher=Educo Leadership Adventures |accessdate=May 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304000220/http://www.educoadventures.org/eia.asp |archivedate=March 4, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Hammond|url=http://transcendentnation.org/alan-hammond.html|publisher=The Transcendent Nation Foundation|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Bahan became an important leader and teacher for Emissaries of Divine Light in the ’60s, ’70s and early ’80s, offering classes at Sunrise Ranch; Epping, New Hampshire;&lt;ref name="ic" /&gt; and Livingston Manor, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyons|first=Richard D.|title=Catskills Rewakening After a Long Sleep|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/25/nyregion/catskills-reawakening-after-a-long-sleep.html|accessdate=May 14, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 25, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a nephew of George Shears, D.C., leader of the G-P-C Chiropractic Movement. He and his brother Walter Bahan (also active in the Emissary program), along with three other brothers (all five chiropractors), operated the Bahan and Bahan Chiropractic Clinics in Salem and Derry, New Hampshire, using GPC principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Ken |title=Bill Bahan: A life of victory, a legacy of love &amp; inspiration |url=http://lifewestcatalog.lifewest.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1330W5745C9C2.176831&amp;profile=main&amp;uri=link=3100006~!23620~!3100001~!3100002&amp;aspect=subtab13&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1&amp;source=~!horizon&amp;term=Bahan%2C+Bill&amp;index=PSUBJ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630213747/http://lifewestcatalog.lifewest.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1330W5745C9C2.176831&amp;profile=main&amp;uri=link=3100006~!23620~!3100001~!3100002&amp;aspect=subtab13&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1&amp;source=~!horizon&amp;term=Bahan,+Bill&amp;index=PSUBJ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |publisher=Life Chiropractic College West |accessdate=May 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill founded the Whole Health Institute, an association of healthcare professionals promoting wholistic health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Bill|title=Attunement With Life|year=1986|publisher=Eden Valley Press, Inc.|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|page=37|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They hosted conferences and lectures around the world, and published the journal ''Healing Currents''. In Bill's words, "Health is the unhindered expression of life through the body, truth through the mind and love through the heart."

===Transition after Lord Exeter's death===
When [[Martin Cecil, 7th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Exeter]] died in January 1988, his son, [[Michael Cecil, 8th Marquess of Exeter|Michael, 8th Marquess of Exeter]] (formerly known as Lord Burghley), became the leader of Emissaries of Divine Light until he left the organisation in 1996.&lt;ref name="religionnewsblog"&gt;{{cite news|last=Todd|first=Douglas|title=Leader left Divine Light behind him|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/4651/leader-left-divine-light-behind-him|accessdate=May 15, 2012|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=September 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that eight-year period, much of the leadership left the organisation, including most of the children of both Lloyd Arthur Meeker and [[Martin Cecil, 7th Marquess of Exeter|Martin, Lord Exeter]], who had been prominent in the network. From 1988 to 1996, more than two thirds of the participants in Emissaries of Divine Light left as well.&lt;ref name="Pitzer1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="religionnewsblog" /&gt; Many ex-members became bitter about their experience and launched accusations against the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cummings |first=Michael |title=Tale of Two Communes: A Scholar and His Errors |url=http://www.ic.org/pnp/cdir/1995/12cummings.php |publisher=Fellowship for Intentional Community |accessdate=May 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928221824/http://www.ic.org/pnp/cdir/1995/12cummings.php |archivedate=September 28, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karchere|first=David|title=My View of Cults|url=http://emissaries.org/about-us/my-view-of-cults/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Michael Cecil, 8th Marquess of Exeter|The 8th Marquess of Exeter]] resigned from his position in 1996, a group of trustees assumed responsibility for the leadership of the network. They set in place ethical guidelines throughout the network and addressed grievances brought to them by participants. They sought to bring the universal truths taught by Lloyd Arthur Meeker into contemporary language and practice.

===Recent history===
In the 1990s, Emissaries of Divine Light developed new programs for spiritual understanding and personal development. ''Deepening Spiritual Expression'' and ''The Opening'' are week-long residential programs that are still offered by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emissaries of Divine Light|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/emissaries-of-divine-light|publisher=Anwers.com|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also developed Attunement Practitioner certification training, which is available at many Emissary centers.

In August 2004, the trustees of Emissaries of Divine Light named David Karchere as the leader of the global network. In 2008, David Karchere and Jane Anetrini developed and taught a year-long leadership program based on the teachings of Emissaries of Divine Light. A second session of the program was conducted in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadership Program|url=http://emissaries.org/programs/leadership-program/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 they initiated a new series of seminars under the title ''Practical Spirituality: An Operator’s Guide to Being Human'', led by David Karchere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practical Spirituality: An Operators Guide to Being Human|url=http://emissaries.org/2012/02/20/practical-spirituality-an-operators-guide-to-being-human/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sunrise Ranch==

==Creative Field Project==
The trustees of Emissaries of Divine Light lead the Creative Field Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Creative Field Project|url=http://thecreativefield.org/creative-field-project/what/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is an exploration of the power of human intention to influence the field of energy held by a group of people. The Creative Field Project began in 2009 with a network of small groups around the world that meet monthly by telephone. It included the first Creative Field Conference in 2011 at Sunrise Ranch that featured [[Lynne McTaggart]], who wrote The Field; and American priest and theologian [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Matthew Fox: Ushering in the Next Stage|url=http://www.issseemblog.org/?p=1565|publisher=The International Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Emissaries of Divine Light joined with the Novalis Ubuntu Institute in Cape Town, South Africa, to host the Creative Field Conference—South Africa: Your Destiny Is Calling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jennifer Ferguson in the limelight|newspaper=The Chronicle, Cape Town, RSA|date=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching and practices==
Emissaries of Divine Light teach that the key to creative living is the individual’s openness to the source of universal power and intelligence within them, and that human emotions either connect a person to that source or cut them off from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meeker|first=Lloyd A.|title=The Third Sacred School, Volume 8, Health, Healing and Attunements Part 2|year=1988|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=1988|pages=475–479}}&lt;/ref&gt; The educational programs of the Emissaries are designed to assist people to find out what has been emotionally triggering them, so that they can withdraw their emotional attention from the trigger and turn it to the life force within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cecil|first=Martin|title=The Third Sacred School, Vol. 14, The Oneness of Heaven and Earth|year=1993|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=105–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emissaries believe that behind all emotions is the universal power of love and a universal intelligence that bring spiritual enlightenment. They teach that through deliberate conscious thought a person can let their own emotional current purify, so that they open themselves to the flow of the universal power and intelligence within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karchere|first=David|title=The Kingdom Within|url=https://emissaries.org/2012/04/30/the-kingdom-within/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The One Law===

The central teaching of Emissaries of Divine Light is referred to as The One Law. They describe it as a law of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Jaclyn Stein|title=The Healing Power of Attunement Therapy: Stories and Practice|year=1998|publisher=New Dawn: A Division of Sterling Publishers (P) Ltd.|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=81 207 2442 9|pages=255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see the causative factor in spiritual regeneration as the universal power and intelligence within all people, and the effect in human experience as dependent on the response to that internal reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Attunement: The Sacred Landscape|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-2-5|pages=23, 24|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They describe the creative process in human experience as the working of The One Law in a sequence of five stages: radiation, response, attraction, union and unified radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Attunement: The Sacred Landscape|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-2-5|pages=24–17|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their seminars claim to assist people to withdraw their energetic response from the circumstances around them and direct it to the power and intelligence within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practical Spirituality|url=http://emissaries.org/programs/practical-spirituality/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emissaries of Divine Light describe the process of personal spiritual renewal as Full Self Emergence because they believe that a person is renewed when their own divine selfhood expresses through their mind, emotions and their body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Full Self Emergence|url=http://emissaries.org/programs/full-self-emergence/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They use the story of the Seven Days of Creation in Genesis as a symbolic template for the process of spiritual renewal in the life of the individual, and for humankind as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Meeker, Lloyd A.  |author2=Cecil, Martin|title=The Third Sacred School, Vol. 6, Creation IV:Seven Days, Seven Spirits|year=1983|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attunement===

[[Attunement]] is a central practice of Emissaries of Divine Light. The origin of the word Attunement refers to the attuning of the human capacity with the universal animating spirit within all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Jaclyn Stein|title=The Healing Power of Attunement Therapy: Stories and Practice|publisher=New Dawn: A Division of Sterling Publishers (P) Ltd.|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=81 207 2442 9|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attunement practitioners believe that positive shifts in consciousness release a healing energy through a person’s body, mind and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Bill|title=Attunement With Life|year=1986|publisher=Eden Valley Press, Inc.|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|pages=25, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emissaries of Divine Light practice Attunement as a form of energy medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laurence|first=Layne|title=The Spiritual Nature of the Physical Body|year=2006|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-0-1|page=9|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attunement practitioners believe that universal life energy is conveyed to the client through the hands of the practitioner. The primary contact points for the client receiving the Attunement are the endocrine glands. Attunement practitioners teach that the endocrine glands are portals for universal life energy that operates through the physical body, and through the mental and emotional function of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laurence|first=Layne|title=The Spiritual Nature of the Physical Body|year=2006|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-0-1|pages=61–72|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emissaries of Divine Light also teach Attunement as a personal spiritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Attunement Guild|url=http://www.attunement.org/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe it is a central factor in the conscious evolution of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meeker|first=Lloyd A.|title=The Third Sacred School, Vol. 7, Health Healing and Attunements Part 1|year=1985|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=367–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major centers==
In addition to their international headquarters at Sunrise Ranch, Emissaries of Divine Light used to operate Glen Ivy in Corona, California, as a conference and retreat center and an Attunement teaching center. Glen Ivy is also a natural mineral springs. The Emissaries leased the mineral springs and the spa property adjacent to their center to Glen Ivy Hot Springs, a popular destination in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Colby|first=Anne|title=The Venerable: Glen Ivy Hot Springs Spa|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/09/image/la-ig-glenivy-20100509|accessdate=May 15, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property was sold in 2016.

'''''Fides quaerens intellectum''''' means "faith seeking understanding" or "faith seeking intelligence". It is the [[Theology|theological]] method stressed by [[Augustine]] (354–430) and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] ({{circa|1033}}&amp;nbsp;– 1109) in which one begins with belief in [[faith]] and on the basis of that faith moves on to further understanding of Christian truth.&lt;ref&gt; Donald K. McKim, Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 1996), 104&lt;/ref&gt; 
Anselm uses this expression for the first time in his [[Proslogion]] (II–IV). It articulates the close relationship between faith and [[Reason|human reason]]. This is the key to Anselm's theological thought and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] thinking. He would understand all things in faith. It means to understand intellectually what we already believe. Chronologically, faith precedes understanding, like when small children first trust their parents and believe what they state, and just later on, when they grow up, they want to examine and understand the reality by themselves. But, logically, intellect precedes faith, because we trust other people, at least in principle, only provisionally, but our aim is a direct personal knowledge. In the words of Anselm of Canterbury : "Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam" ("I do not seek to understand in order that I may believe, but rather, I believe in order that I may understand").

'''Gabino Barreda''' (b. [[Puebla]], 1818 – d. [[Mexico City]] 1881) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[physician]] and [[philosophy|philosopher]] oriented to [[France|French]] [[positivism]].

After participating in the [[U.S.-Mexican War]] defending his country as a volunteer, he studied medicine in [[Paris]] (1847–1851). There he became acquainted with [[Auguste Comte]]'s doctrine of [[positivism]], before his first publications in philosophy. Upon returning to Mexico City, he introduced the positivistic school, and taught in [[Guanajuato]] (1863–67) until the fall of the [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] empire.

In 1867, he headed the educational commission of President [[Benito Juárez]], where he was able to implement Comte's positivism in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Hale, ''The Transformation of Liberalism in Late Nineteenth-Century Mexico'', Princeton: Princeton University Press 1989, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission established the [[National Preparatory School]] (''Escuela Nacional Preparatoria'' (ENP)), where he served director for a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''The Transformation of Liberalism'', pp. 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Barreda was closely associated with Juárez and his successor following his death, [[Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada]], the Díaz regime forced him out from the ENP in 1878, to be Mexican ambassador to the [[German Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''The Transformation of Liberalism'', p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; a prestigious post, but far from the action of Mexican power. Barreda influenced many traditionalist thinkers during the [[Porfirio Díaz|Porfirian regime]].

To this day, he is acknowledged as an important figure of [[education in Mexico]], one of the fathers of the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] and the undergraduate medal for the top student of each major's class is named in his honor.

{{For|the infancy gospel|Infancy Gospel of Thomas}}
[[File:Nag Hammadi Codex II.jpg|thumb|[[Nag Hammadi Codex II]], folio 32, the beginning of the Gospel of Thomas]]

&lt;!-- The Infancy Gospel of Thomas is a group of texts of uncertain date and contents, and the title is an arbitrary construction of modern scholars. Up until 1945 it was primarily referred to as the "Gospel of Thomas". See Ehrman &amp; Plebe 2011:19. --&gt;
{{New Testament Apocrypha}}
{{Gnosticism}}
The '''Gospel of Thomas''' is a [[non-canonical]] [[Logia|sayings gospel]]. It was discovered near [[Nag Hammadi]], Egypt, in December 1945 among a group of books known as the [[Nag Hammadi library]]. Scholars speculate that the works were buried in response to a letter from Bishop [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] declaring a strict [[Biblical canon|canon]] of Christian scripture.&lt;ref&gt;The books, technically called [[codex|codices]] had been bound by a method now called [[Coptic binding]] and placed in an earthenware jar. They were damaged by their discoverers, a group of peasants who broke the jar open and manhandled its contents.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strobel, Lee. “The Case for Christ (2017).” IMDb, IMDb.com, www.imdb.com/title/tt6113488/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Coptic language|Coptic-language]] text, the second of seven contained in what modern-day scholars have designated as Codex II, is composed of 114 sayings attributed to [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Modern-day scholars have numbered the sayings and even parts of the sayings, but the text contains no numbering.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half of these sayings resemble those found in the [[Canonical Gospels]], while it is speculated that the other sayings were added from [[Gnostic]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;''Lost Scriptures: Books that did not make it into the New Testament'' by Bart Ehrman, pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; Its place of origin may have been [[Syria]], where [[Thomasism|Thomasine]] traditions were strong.&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible'' by James D. G. Dunn, John William Rogerson, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8028-3711-5}} page 1574&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction states: "These are the hidden words that the [[Resurrection of Jesus|living Jesus]] spoke and Didymos Judas Thomas wrote them down."&lt;ref&gt;''The Fifth Gospel'', Patterson, Robinson, Bethge, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Didymus ([[Koine Greek|Greek]]) and Thomas ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]) both mean "twin". Some critical scholars suspect that this reference to the [[Thomas the Apostle|Apostle Thomas]] is false, and that therefore the true author is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;April D. DeConick 2006 ''The Original Gospel of Thomas in Translation'' {{ISBN|0-567-04382-7}} page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the document originated within a [[school (discipline)|school]] of [[early Christians]], possibly [[Gnosticism|proto-Gnostics]]. Some verses are similar to verses in the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bentley Layton|Layton, Bentley]], ''The Gnostic Scriptures'', 1987, p.361.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics further state that even the description of Thomas as a "gnostic" gospel is based upon little other than the fact that it was found along with gnostic texts at Nag Hammadi.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan L. Davies|Davies, Stevan L.]], ''The Gospel of Thomas and Christian Wisdom'', 1983, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Thomas was also attached to the [[Book of Thomas the Contender]], which was also in Nag Hammadi Codex II, and the [[Acts of Thomas]]. While the Gospel of Thomas does not directly point to Jesus' divinity, it also does not directly contradict it, and therefore neither supports nor contradicts gnostic beliefs. When asked his identity in the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus usually deflects, ambiguously asking the disciples why they do not see what is right in front of them, similar to some passages in the canonical gospels like John 12:16 and Luke 18:34.

The Gospel of Thomas is very different in tone and structure from other [[New Testament apocrypha]] and the four [[Gospel#Canonical gospels|Canonical Gospels]]. Unlike the canonical Gospels, it is not a [[Narrative#Literary theory|narrative]] account of the life of Jesus; instead, it consists of ''[[logia]]'' (sayings) attributed to Jesus, sometimes stand-alone, sometimes embedded in short [[Dialogue#Literary and philosophical genre|dialogues]] or parables. The text contains a possible allusion to the death of Jesus in logion 65&lt;ref&gt;DeConick, April D., ''The Original Gospel of Thomas in Translation'', 2006, p.214&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen|Parable of the Wicked Tenants]], paralleled in the [[Synoptic Gospels]]), but does not mention his [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], his [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], or the [[final judgement|final judgment]]; nor does it mention a messianic understanding of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Alister E. McGrath, 2006 ''Christian Theology'' {{ISBN|1-4051-5360-1}} page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Dunn, John Rogerson 2003 ''Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible'' {{ISBN|0-8028-3711-5}} page 1573&lt;/ref&gt; Since its discovery, many scholars have seen it as evidence in support of the existence of the so-called [[Q source]], which might have been very similar in its form as a collection of sayings of Jesus without any accounts of his deeds or his life and death, a so-called "sayings gospel".&lt;ref&gt;Udo Schnelle, 2007 ''Einleitung in das Neue Testament'' {{ISBN|978-3-8252-1830-0}} page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop [[Eusebius]] included it among a group of books that he believed to be not only spurious, but "the fictions of heretics". However, it is not clear whether he was referring to this Gospel of Thomas or one of the other texts attributed to Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: Church History, Book III (Eusebius)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finds and publication==
[[File:P. Oxy. 1.jpg|thumb|P. Oxy. 1]]
[[File:Nag Hammadi Codex II.jpg|thumb|[[Nag Hammadi Codex II]], folio 32, the beginning of the Gospel of Thomas]]
The manuscript of the Coptic text ([[Nag Hammadi Codex II|CG II]]), found in 1945 at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, is dated at around 340 AD. It was first published in a photographic edition in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;For photocopies of the manuscript see: {{cite web |url=http://www.gospels.net/thomas/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008055033/http://www.gospels.net/thomas/ |archivedate=8 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed three years later (1959) by the first English-language translation, with Coptic transcription.&lt;ref&gt;A. Guillaumont, Henri-Charles Puech, Gilles Quispel, Walter Till and Yassah `Abd Al Masih, ''The Gospel According to Thomas'' (E. J. Brill and Harper &amp; Brothers, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, [[James M. Robinson]] edited the first complete collection of English translations of the Nag Hammadi texts.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, James M., General Editor, ''The Nag Hammadi Library in English'', Revised Edition 1988, E.J. Brill, Leiden, and Harper and Row, San Francisco, {{ISBN|90-04-08856-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of Thomas has been translated and annotated worldwide in many languages.

The original Coptic manuscript is now the property of the [[Coptic Museum]] in Cairo, Egypt, Department of Manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;''Coptic Gnostic Papyri in the Coptic Museum at Old Cairo'', vol. I (Cairo, 1956) plates 80, line 10 – 99, line 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxyrhynchus papyrus fragments===
After the Coptic version of the complete text was discovered in 1945 at Nag Hammadi, scholars soon realized that three different Greek text fragments previously found at [[Oxyrhynchus]] (the [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]), also in Egypt, were part of the Gospel of Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Pyne Grenfell|Bernard P. Grenfell]] and [[Arthur Hunt|Arthur S. Hunt]], ''Sayings of Our Lord from an early Greek Papyrus'' (Egypt Exploration Fund; 1897)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Grant and [[David Noel Freedman]], ''The Secret Sayings of Jesus according to the Gospel of Thomas'' (Fontana Books, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; These three papyrus fragments of Thomas date to between 130 and 250 AD.
Prior to the Nag Hammadi library discovery, the sayings of Jesus found in Oxyrhynchus were known simply as [[Logia|Logia Iesu]]. The corresponding [[Uncial script]] Greek fragments of the Gospel of Thomas, found in Oxyrhynchus are:
*[[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1|P. Oxy. 1]] : fragments of logia 26 through 33, with the last two sentences of logion 77 in the Coptic version included at the end of logion 30 herein.
*[[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 654|P. Oxy. 654]] : fragments of the beginning through logion 7, logion 24 and logion 36 on the flip side of a papyrus containing [[surveying]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://163.1.169.40/cgi-bin/library?e=d-000-00---0POxy--00-0-0--0prompt-10---4----ded--0-1l--1-en-50---20-about-1708--00031-001-1-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;c=POxy&amp;cl=CL5.1.4&amp;d=HASH66d3d01e4d152cbe92ae08|title=P.Oxy.IV 0654|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 655|P. Oxy. 655]] : fragments of logia 36 through 39. 8 fragments designated ''a'' through ''h'', whereof ''f'' and ''h'' have since been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://163.1.169.40/cgi-bin/library?e=d-000-00---0POxy--00-0-0--0prompt-10---4----ded--0-1l--1-en-50---20-about-1708--00031-001-1-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;c=POxy&amp;cl=CL5.1.4&amp;d=HASH66d3d01e4d152cc692ae08|title=P.Oxy.IV 0655|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of the Coptic sometimes differs markedly from the earlier Greek Oxyrhynchus texts, the extreme case being that the last portion of logion 30 in the Greek is found at the end of logion 77 in the Coptic. This fact, along with the quite different wording Hippolytus uses when apparently quoting it (see below), suggests that the Gospel of Thomas "may have circulated in more than one form and passed through several stages of redaction."&lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew'' (New York, 1990) p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is generally thought that the Gospel of Thomas was first composed in Greek, there is evidence that the Coptic Nag Hammadi text is a translation from [[Syriac language|Syriac]] (see [[Gospel of Thomas#Syriac origin|Syriac origin]]).

===Attestation===
The earliest surviving written references to the ''Gospel of Thomas'' are found in the writings of [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus of Rome]] (''c.'' 222–235) and [[Origen of Alexandria]] (''c.'' 233).&lt;ref&gt;Koester 1990, pp.77ff&lt;/ref&gt; Hippolytus wrote in his ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'' 5.7.20:

{{quote|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;The [[Naassenes]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; speak...of a nature which is both hidden and revealed at the same time and which they call the thought-for kingdom of heaven which is in a human being. They transmit a tradition concerning this in the Gospel entitled "According to Thomas," which states expressly, "The one who seeks me will find me in children of seven years and older, for there, hidden in the fourteenth [[aeon]], I am revealed."}}

This appears to be a reference to saying 4 of Thomas, although the wording differs significantly.

[[Origen]] listed the "Gospel according to Thomas" as being among the [[heterodoxy|heterodox]] apocryphal gospels known to him (''Hom. in Luc.'' 1).

In the 4th and 5th centuries, various Church Fathers wrote that the Gospel of Thomas was highly valued by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]]. In the 4th century, [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] mentioned a "Gospel of Thomas" twice in his ''[[Catechesis]]'': "The Manichæans also wrote a Gospel according to Thomas, which being tinctured with the fragrance of the evangelic title corrupts the souls of the simple sort."&lt;ref&gt;Cyril ''Catechesis'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310104.htm 4.36]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Let none read the Gospel according to Thomas: for it is the work not of one of the twelve Apostles, but of one of the three wicked disciples of Manes."&lt;ref&gt;Cyril ''Catechesis'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310106.htm 6.31]&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th-century ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' includes "A Gospel attributed to Thomas which the Manichaean use" in its list of heretical books.&lt;ref&gt;Koester 1990 p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date of composition==
Richard Valantasis writes:
{{quote|Assigning a date to the Gospel of Thomas is very complex because it is difficult to know precisely to what a date is being assigned. Scholars have proposed a date as early as 40 AD or as late as 140 AD, depending upon whether the Gospel of Thomas is identified with the original core of sayings, or with the author's published text, or with the Greek or Coptic texts, or with parallels in other literature.&lt;ref&gt;Valantasis, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Valantasis and other scholars argue that it is difficult to date Thomas because, as a collection of ''logia'' without a narrative framework, individual sayings could have been added to it gradually over time.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Robinson, and Bethge (1998), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Valantasis dates Thomas to 100 – 110 AD, with some of the material certainly coming from the first stratum which is dated to 30 – 60 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Valantasis, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; J. R. Porter dates the Gospel of Thomas much later, to 250 AD.&lt;ref name="The Lost Bible"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Lost Bible | author1-first= J. R. | author1-last= Porter| year= 2010 |publisher= Metro Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4351-4169-8|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early camp===
[[Robert E. Van Voorst]] states:
{{quote|Most interpreters place its writing in the second century, understanding that many of its oral traditions are much older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Voorst |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert E. Van Voorst |title=Jesus Outside the New Testament: an introduction to the ancient evidence |location=Grand Rapids |publisher=Eerdmans |year=2000 |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Scholars generally fall into one of two main camps: an "early camp" favoring a date for the "core" of between the years 50 and 100, before or approximately contemporary with the composition of the canonical gospels and a "late camp" favoring a date in the 2nd century, after composition of the canonical gospels.

====Form of the gospel====
Theissen and Merz argue the genre of a collection of sayings was one of the earliest forms in which material about Jesus was handed down.&lt;ref name="theissen"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide |first=Gerd |last=Theissen |first2=Annette |last2=Merz |isbn=0-8006-3122-6 |location=Minneapolis |publisher=Fortress Press |year=1998 |pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that other collections of sayings, such as the [[Q document]] and the collection underlying [[Mark 4]], were absorbed into larger narratives and no longer survive as independent documents, and that no later collections in this form survive.&lt;ref name="theissen"/&gt; [[Marvin Meyer]] also asserted that the genre of a "sayings collection" is indicative of the 1st century,&lt;ref name="meyer"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Jesus Then &amp; Now: Images of Jesus in History and Christology |isbn=1-56338-344-6 |first=Marvin |last=Meyer |editor-first=Marvin |editor-last=Meyer |editor2-first=Charles |editor2-last=Hughes |contribution=Albert Schweitzer and the Image of Jesus in the Gospel of Thomas |location=Harrisburg, PA |publisher=Trinity Press International |year=2001 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that in particular the "use of parables without allegorical amplification" seems to antedate the canonical gospels.&lt;ref name="meyer"/&gt; [[Maurice Casey]] has strongly questioned the argument from genre: the "logic of the argument requires that Q and the Gospel of Thomas be also dated at the same time as both the [[book of Proverbs]] and the ''[[Instruction of Amenemope|Sayings of Amen-em-Opet]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Casey |title=An Aramaic Approach to Q: Sources for the Gospels of Matthew and Luke |series=Society for New Testament Studies Monograph Series |volume=122 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0521817233 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=March 2015}}

====Independence from Synoptic Gospels====
[[Stevan L. Davies]] argues that the apparent independence of the ordering of sayings in Thomas from that of their parallels in the synoptics shows that Thomas was not evidently reliant upon the [[canonical gospels]] and probably predated them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.misericordia.edu/davies/thomas/correl.htm|title=Misericordia University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=nonpeer reviewed|date=July 2016}} Several authors argue that when the logia in Thomas do have parallels in the synoptics, the version in Thomas often seems closer to the source. Theissen and Merz give sayings 31 and 65 as examples of this.&lt;ref name="theissen"/&gt; Koester agrees, citing especially the parables contained in sayings 8, 9, 57, 63, 64 and 65.&lt;ref name="koester"/&gt; In the few instances where the version in Thomas seems to be dependent on the Synoptics, Koester suggests, this may be due to the influence of the person who translated the text from Greek into Coptic.&lt;ref name="koester"/&gt;

Koester also argues that the absence of narrative materials (such as those found in the canonical gospels) in Thomas makes it unlikely that the gospel is "an eclectic excerpt from the gospels of the New Testament".&lt;ref name="koester"&gt;{{Cite book |page=125 |first=Helmut |last=Koester |first2=Thomas O. |last2=Lambdin (translator) |contribution=The Gospel of Thomas |editor-first=James MacConkey |editor-last=Robinson |title=The Nag Hammadi Library in English |publisher=E. J. Brill |location=Leiden, New York, Cologne |year=1996 |isbn=90-04-08856-3 |edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also cites the absence of the eschatological sayings considered characteristic of [[Q source|Q]] to show the independence of Thomas from that source.&lt;ref name="koester"/&gt;

====Intertextuality with John's gospel====
{{Update|section|date=September 2016}}&lt;!-- The majority of this section's sources come from the early-to-mid 2000s, and the final paragraph says that as "the scholarly debate continues" someone "recently" responded to these in 2009. This is clearly out of date. --&gt;
Another argument for an early date is what some scholars have suggested is an interplay between the [[Gospel of John]] and the ''logia'' of Thomas. Parallels between the two have been taken to suggest that Thomas' ''logia'' preceded John's work, and that the latter was making a point-by-point riposte to Thomas, either in real or mock conflict. This seeming dialectic has been pointed out by several New Testament scholars, notably Gregory J. Riley,&lt;ref&gt;''Resurrection Reconsidered: Thomas and John in Conflict'' (Augsberg Fortess, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; [[April DeConick]],&lt;ref&gt;''Voices of the Mystics: Early Christian Discourse in the Gospel of John and Thomas and Other Ancient Christian Literature'' (T&amp;T Clark, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elaine Pagels]].&lt;ref name="Beyond Belief 2004"&gt;''Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas''. (New York: Vintage, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Though differing in approach, they argue that several verses in the Gospel of John are best understood as responses to a Thomasine community and its beliefs. Pagels, for example, says that John's gospel makes two references to the inability of the world to recognize the divine light.&lt;ref&gt;Jn 1:5, 1:10; Jn 14:5-6&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=February 2011}} In contrast, several of Thomas' sayings refer to the light born 'within'.&lt;ref&gt;logia 24, 50, 61, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

John's gospel is the only canonical one that gives [[Thomas the Apostle]] a dramatic role and spoken part, and Thomas is the only character therein described as having ''apistos'' (unbelief), despite the failings of virtually all the Johannine characters to live up to the author's standards of belief. With respect to the famous story of "[[Doubting Thomas]]",&lt;ref&gt;(Jn. 20:26–29)&lt;/ref&gt; it is suggested&lt;ref name="Beyond Belief 2004"/&gt; that John may have been denigrating or ridiculing a rival school of thought. In another apparent contrast, John's text matter-of-factly presents a bodily resurrection as if this is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the faith; in contrast, Thomas' insights about the spirit-and-body are more nuanced.&lt;ref&gt;(logia 29, 80, 87)&lt;/ref&gt; For Thomas, resurrection seems more a cognitive event of spiritual attainment, one even involving a certain discipline or asceticism. Again, an apparently denigrating portrayal in the "Doubting Thomas" story may either be taken literally, or as a kind of mock "comeback" to Thomas' logia: not as an outright censuring of Thomas, but an improving gloss. After all, Thomas' thoughts about the spirit and body are really not so different from those which John has presented elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Jn. 3:6, 6:52–6 – but pointedly contrasting these with 6:63&lt;/ref&gt; John portrays Thomas as physically touching the risen Jesus, inserting fingers and hands into his body, and ending with a shout. Pagels interprets this as signifying [[one-upmanship]] by John, who is forcing Thomas to acknowledge Jesus' bodily nature. She writes that "...he shows Thomas giving up his search for experiential truth – his 'unbelief' – to confess what John sees as the truth...".&lt;ref&gt;Pagels, Elaine. Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas. New York: Vintage, 2004. pp. 66–73&lt;/ref&gt; The point of these examples, as used by Riley and Pagels, is to support the argument that the text of Thomas must have existed and have gained a following at the time of the writing of John's Gospel, and that the importance of the Thomasine logia was great enough that John felt the necessity of weaving them into his own narrative.

As the scholarly debate continues on the issue of possible John–Thomas interplay, Christopher Skinner more recently responded in part to Riley, DeConick, and Pagels with ''John and Thomas – Gospels in Conflict?'' (Wipf and Stock, Princeton Theological Monograph Series 115, 2009).

====Role of James====
Albert Hogeterp argues that the Gospel's saying 12, which attributes leadership of the community to [[James the Just]] rather than to [[Simon Peter|Peter]], agrees with the description of the early Jerusalem church by Paul in Galatians {{bibleverse-nb||Galatians|2:1–14}} and may reflect a tradition predating AD 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Paul and God's Temple |first=Albert L A |last=Hogeterp |location=Leuven, Netherlands; Dudley, MA |publisher=Peeters |year=2006 |isbn=90-429-1722-9 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer also lists "uncertainty about James the righteous, the brother of Jesus" as characteristic of a 1st-century origin.&lt;ref name="meyer"/&gt;

In later traditions (most notably in the [[Acts of Thomas]], [[Book of Thomas the Contender]], etc.), Thomas is regarded as the twin brother of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, John D. {{cite web |url=http://jdt.unl.edu/thomasbook.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130132129/http://jdt.unl.edu/thomasbook.htm |archivedate=30 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}  (NHC II,7, 138,4). Retrieved 2016/01/08&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, this gospel holds some sentences (log. 55, 99 y 101), that are in opposition with the [[brothers of Jesus|familiar group of Jesus]], which involves difficulties, when it tries to identify him with James, the brother, quoted by [[Josephus]] in [[Antiquities of the Jews]]. Moreover, there are some sayings, (principally log. 6, 14, 104) and [[Oxyrhinchus|Oxyrh. papyri 654]] (log. 6) in which Gospel is shown in the opposite point of view to [[Judaism|Jewish mores]] specially in respect to the circumcision and dietary practices (log. 55), key issue, in the early [[Jewish Christian|Jewish-Christian community]] led by James (Acts 15: 1-35, Gal. 2:1–10).{{clarify|this garbled sentence is not clear or idiomatic English|date=December 2017}}

====Depiction of Peter and Matthew====
In saying 13, Peter and Matthew are depicted as unable to understand the true significance or identity of Jesus. Patterson argues that this can be interpreted as a criticism against the school of Christianity associated with the Gospel of Matthew, and that "[t]his sort of rivalry seems more at home in the first century than later", when all the apostles had become revered figures.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson et al. (1998), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parallel with Paul====
According to Meyer, Thomas's saying 17: "I shall give you what no eye has seen, what no ear has heard and no hand has touched, and what has not come into the human heart", is strikingly similar to what [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] wrote in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|2:9}}&lt;ref name="meyer"/&gt; (which was itself an allusion to {{bibleverse||Isaiah|64:4}}&lt;ref name="1corNIV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:9&amp;version=NIV|title=1 Corinthians 2:9 (footnote a.)|year=2011|work=New International Version|publisher=Biblica, Inc.|accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Late camp===
The late camp dates ''Thomas'' some time after 100 AD, generally in the mid-2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Darrell L. Bock]], "Response to [[John Dominic Crossan]]" in ''The Historical Jesus'' ed. James K. Beilby and Paul Rhodes Eddy. 148–149. "...for most scholars the ''Gospel of Thomas'' is seen as an early-second century text." (148–149).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darrell L. Bock, ''The Missing Gospels'' (Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2006).61; 63. "Most date the gospel to the second century and place its origin in Syria...Most scholars regard the book as an early second-century work."(61); "However, for most scholars, the bulk of it is later reflecting a second-century work."(63)&lt;/ref&gt; They generally believe that although the text was composed around the mid-2nd century, it contains earlier sayings such as those originally found in the New Testament gospels of which ''Thomas'' was in some sense dependent in addition to inauthentic and possibly authentic independent sayings not found in any other extant text. J. R. Porter dates Thomas much later, to the mid-third century.&lt;ref name="The Lost Bible"/&gt;

====Dependence on the New Testament====
Several scholars have argued that the sayings in ''Thomas'' reflect conflations and harmonisations dependent on the [[canonical gospels]]. For example, saying 10 and 16 appear to contain a redacted harmonisation of {{bibleverse||Luke|12:49}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|12:51–52}} and {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:34–35}}. In this case it has been suggested that the dependence is best explained by the author of ''Thomas'' making use of an earlier harmonised oral tradition based on Matthew and Luke.&lt;ref&gt;[[Klyne Snodgrass|Klyne R. Snodgrass]], "The Gospel of Thomas: A Secondary Gospel" in ''The Historical Jesus:Critical Concepts
in Religious Studies. Volume 4: Lives of Jesus and Jesus outside the Bible.'' Ed. [[Craig A. Evans]]. 299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert M. Grant (theologian)|Robert M. Grant]] and [[David Noel Freedman]], ''The Secret Sayings of Jesus'' (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1960) 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt;  Biblical scholar [[Craig A. Evans]] also subscribes to this view and notes that "Over half of the New Testament writings are quoted, paralleled, or alluded to in Thomas... I'm not aware of a Christian writing prior to AD 150 that references this much of the New Testament."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strobel|first=Lee|title=The Case for the Real Jesus|year=2007|publisher=Zondervan|location=United States|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument made for the late dating of Thomas is based upon the fact that Saying 5 in the original Greek (Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 654) seems to follow the vocabulary used in the gospel according to Luke ({{bibleverse||Luke|8:17}}), and not the vocabulary used in the gospel according to Mark ({{bibleverse||Mark|4:22}}). According to this argument – which presupposes firstly the rectitude of the [[two-source hypothesis]] (widely held among current New Testament scholars{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}), in which the author of Luke is seen as having used the pre-existing gospel according to Mark plus a lost [[Q document]] to compose his gospel – if the author of Thomas did, as Saying 5 suggests – refer to a pre-existing gospel according to Luke, rather than Mark's vocabulary, then the gospel of Thomas must have been composed after both Mark and Luke (the latter of which is dated to between 60 AD and 90 AD).

Another saying that employs similar vocabulary to that used in Luke rather than Mark is Saying 31 in the original Greek (Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1), where Luke 4:24's term ''dektos'' (acceptable) {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|4:24}} is employed rather than {{bibleverse||Mark|6:4}}'s ''atimos'' (without honor). The word ''dektos'' (in all its cases and genders) is clearly typical of Luke, since it is only employed by him in the canonical gospels {{bibleverse||Luke|4:19}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|4:24}}; {{bibleverse||Acts|10:35}}). Thus, the argument runs, the Greek Thomas has clearly been at least influenced by Luke's characteristic vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;For general discussion, see John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew,'' (New York, 1991) pp. 137; pp. 163–64 n. 133. See also [[Christopher Tuckett]], "Thomas and the Synoptics," ''Novum Testamentum'' 30 (1988) 132–57, esp. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

J. R. Porter states that, because around half of the sayings in  Thomas have parallels in the synoptic gospels, it is "possible that the sayings in the Gospel of Thomas were selected directly from the canonical gospels and were either reproduced more or less exactly or amended to fit the author's distinctive theological outlook."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Lost Bible | author1-first= J. R. | author1-last= Porter| year= 2010 |publisher= Metro Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4351-4169-8|page= 166}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John P. Meier, scholars predominantly conclude that Thomas depends on or harmonizes the Synoptics.&lt;ref&gt;See summary in John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew'' (New York, 1991) pp. 135–138, especially the footnotes.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Syriac origin=====
Several scholars argue that Thomas is dependent on Syriac writings, including unique versions of the canonical gospels. They contend that many sayings of the Gospel of Thomas are more similar to Syriac translations of the canonical gospels than their record in the original Greek. [[Craig A. Evans]] states that saying 54 in ''Thomas'', which speaks of the poor and the kingdom of heaven, is more similar to the Syriac version of Matthew 5:3 than the Greek version of that passage or the parallel in Luke 6:20.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Craig A.

[[Klyne Snodgrass]] notes that saying 65–66 of ''Thomas'' containing the [[Parable of the Tenants|Parable of the Wicked Tenants]] appears to be dependent on the early harmonisation of Mark and Luke found in the old Syriac gospels. He concludes that, "''Thomas'', rather than representing the earliest form, has been shaped by this harmonizing tendency in Syria. If the ''Gospel of Thomas'' were the earliest, we would have to imagine that each of the evangelists or the traditions behind them expanded the parable in different directions and then that in the process of transmission the text was trimmed back to the form it has in the Syriac Gospels. It is much more likely that Thomas, which has a Syrian provenance, is dependent on the tradition of the canonical Gospels that has been abbreviated and harmonized by oral transmission."&lt;ref&gt;[[Klyne Snodgrass|Klyne R. Snodgrass]], "The Gospel of Thomas: A Secondary Gospel" in ''The Historical Jesus:Critical Concepts in Religious Studies. Volume 4: Lives of Jesus and Jesus outside the Bible.'' Ed. [[Craig A. Evans]]. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Perrin]] argues that ''Thomas'' is dependent on the ''[[Diatessaron]]'', which was composed shortly after 172 by [[Tatian]] in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Perrin, "Thomas: The Fifth Gospel?," ''Journal of The Evangelical Theological Society'' 49 (March 2006): 66–80&lt;/ref&gt; Perrin explains the order of the sayings by attempting to demonstrate that almost all adjacent sayings are connected by Syriac catchwords, whereas in Coptic or Greek, catchwords have been found for only less than half of the pairs of adjacent sayings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perrin |first=Nicholas |title=Thomas and Tatian: The Relationship Between the Gospel of Thomas and the Diatessaron |series=Academia Biblica |volume=5 |location=Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter J. Williams analyzed Perrin's alleged Syriac catchwords and found them implausible.
&lt;ref&gt;Williams, P.J., "Alleged Syriac Catchwords in the Gospel of Thomas" ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Volume 63, Number 1, 2009, pp. 71–82(12) BRILL [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/vc/2009/00000063/00000001/art00004]&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Shedinger wrote that since Perrin attempts to reconstruct an [[Syriac language|Old Syriac]] version of Thomas without first establishing Thomas' reliance on the ''Diatessaron'', Perrin's logic seems [[Circular reasoning|circular]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Shedinger, "Thomas and Tatian: The Relationship between the Gospel of Thomas and the Diatessaron by Nicholas Perrin" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', Vol. 122, No. 2 (Summer, 2003), pp. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Lack of apocalyptic themes=====
[[Bart Ehrman]] argues that the [[Historical Jesus#Apocalyptic prophet|historical Jesus]] was an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] preacher, and that his apocalyptic beliefs are recorded in the earliest Christian documents: Mark and the authentic [[Pauline epistles]]. The earliest Christians believed Jesus would soon return, and their beliefs are echoed in the earliest Christian writings. The Gospel of Thomas proclaims that the Kingdom of God is already present for those who understand the secret message of Jesus (Saying 113), and lacks apocalyptic themes. Because of this, Ehrman argues, the Gospel of Thomas was probably composed by a Gnostic some time in the early 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[N.T. Wright]], former Anglican bishop and professor of New Testament history, also sees the dating of Thomas in the 2nd or 3rd century. Wright's reasoning for this dating is that the "narrative framework" of 1st-century Judaism and the New Testament is radically different from the worldview expressed in the sayings collected in the Gospel of Thomas. Thomas makes an anachronistic mistake by turning Jesus the Jewish prophet into a Hellenistic/Cynic philosopher. Wright concludes his section on the Gospel of Thomas in his book ''The New Testament and the People of God'' in this way: "[Thomas'] implicit story has to do with a figure who imparts a secret, hidden wisdom to those close to him, so that they can perceive a new truth and be saved by it. 'The Thomas Christians are told the truth about their divine origins, and given the secret passwords that will prove effective in the return journey to their heavenly home.' This is, obviously, the non-historical story of Gnosticism... It is simply the case that, on good historical grounds, it is far more likely that the book represents a radical translation, and indeed subversion, of first-century Christianity into a quite different sort of religion, than that it represents the original of which the longer gospels are distortions... Thomas reflects a symbolic universe, and a worldview, which are radically different from those of the early Judaism and Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=N.T.|title=The New Testament and the People of God|year=1992|publisher=Fortress Press|pages=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the New Testament Canon==
[[File:Nag Hammadi coptic.gif|thumb|Last page of the Gospel of Thomas]]

The harsh and widespread reaction to [[Marcion]]'s [[Development of the New Testament canon#Marcion of Sinope|canon]], the first New Testament canon known to have been created, may demonstrate that, by 140 AD, it had become widely accepted that other texts formed parts of the records of the life and ministry of Jesus.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Although arguments about some potential New Testament books, such as the ''[[Shepherd of Hermas]]'' and [[Book of Revelation]], continued well into the 4th century, four canonical gospels, attributed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were accepted among proto-orthodox Christians at least as early as the mid-2nd century. Tatian's widely used ''[[Diatessaron]]'', compiled between 160 and 175 AD, utilized the four gospels without any consideration of others. Irenaeus of Lyons wrote in the late 2nd century that ''since there are four quarters of the earth ... it is fitting that the church should have four pillars ... the four Gospels'' (''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'', 3.11.8), and then shortly thereafter made the first known quotation from a fourth gospel—the canonical version of the Gospel of John. The late 2nd-century [[Muratorian fragment]] also recognizes only the three synoptic gospels and John. Bible scholar [[Bruce Metzger]] wrote regarding the formation of the New Testament canon, "Although the fringes of the emerging canon remained unsettled for generations, a high degree of unanimity concerning the greater part of the New Testament was attained among the very diverse and scattered congregations of believers not only throughout the Mediterranean world, but also over an area extending from Britain to Mesopotamia."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''The Canon of the New Testament:its origin, development and significance'' p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the Thomasine Milieu==
The question also arises as to various sects' usage of other works attributed to Thomas and their relation to this work. The [[Book of Thomas the Contender]], also from Nag Hammadi, is foremost among these, but the extensive [[Acts of Thomas]] provides the mythological connections. The short and comparatively straightforward [[Apocalypse of Thomas]] has no immediate connection with the synoptic gospels, while the canonical [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] – if the name can be taken to refer to Judas Thomas Didymus – certainly attests to early intra-Christian conflict. The [[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]], shorn of its mythological connections, is difficult to connect specifically to our gospel, but the Acts of Thomas contains the [[Hymn of the Pearl]] whose content is reflected in the [[Psalms of Thomas]] found in Manichaean literature. These psalms, which otherwise reveal Mandaean connections, also contain material overlapping the Gospel of Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Masing, Uku &amp; Kaide Rätsep, Barlaam and Joasaphat: some problems connected with the story of "Barlaam &amp; Joasaphat", the Acts of Thomas, the Psalms of Thomas and the Gospel of Thomas, ''Communio Viatorum'' 4:1 (1961) 29–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance and author==
[[File:P. Oxy. 655.jpg|thumb|P. Oxy. 655]]
As one of the earliest accounts of the teachings of Jesus, the ''Gospel of Thomas'' is regarded by some scholars as one of the most important texts in understanding early Christianity outside the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name="Funk"&gt;Funk 1993 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of faith, however, no major Christian group accepts this gospel as canonical or authoritative. It is an important work for scholars working on the [[Q document]], which itself is thought to be a collection of sayings or teachings upon which the gospels of Matthew and Luke are partly based. Although no copy of Q has ever been discovered, the fact that Thomas is similarly a 'sayings' Gospel is viewed by some scholars as an indication that the early Christians did write collections of the sayings of Jesus, bolstering the Q hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;B. Ehrman (2003) pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars do not consider [[Thomas the Apostle|Apostle Thomas]] the author of this document and the author remains unknown. J. Menard produced a summary of the academic consensus in the mid-1970s which stated that the gospel was probably a very late text written by a Gnostic author, thus having very little relevance to the study of the early development of Christianity. Scholarly views of Gnosticism and the Gospel of Thomas have since become more nuanced and diverse.&lt;ref&gt;April D. De Conick (2006) ''The original Gospel of Thomas in translation'' {{ISBN|0-567-04382-7}} pages 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; Paterson Brown, for example, has argued forcefully that the three Coptic Gospels of Thomas, [[Gospel of Philip|Philip]] and [[Gospel of Truth|Truth]] are demonstrably not Gnostic writings, since all three explicitly affirm the basic reality and sanctity of incarnate life, which Gnosticism by definition considers illusory and evil.

In the 4th century [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] considered the author a disciple of [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] who was also called Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Schneemelcher 2006 ''New Testament Apocrypha'' {{ISBN|0-664-22721-X}} page 111&lt;/ref&gt; Cyril stated:
&lt;ref&gt;Bentley Layton 1989 ''Nag Hammadi codex II, 2–7: Gospel according to Thomas'' {{ISBN|90-04-08131-3}} page 106&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Mani had three disciples: Thomas, Baddas and Hermas. Let no one read the Gospel according to Thomas. For he is not one of the twelve apostles but one of the three wicked disciples of Mani.}}

Many scholars consider the ''Gospel of Thomas'' to be a [[gnostic]] text, since it was found in a library among others, it contains Gnostic themes, and perhaps presupposes a Gnostic worldview.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman 2003 pp.59ff&lt;/ref&gt; Others reject this interpretation, because ''Thomas'' lacks the full-blown mythology of Gnosticism as described by [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] (ca. 185), and because Gnostics frequently appropriated and used a large "range of scripture from Genesis to the Psalms to Homer, from the Synoptics to John to the letters of Paul."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan L. Davies|Davies, Stevan]]. "Thomas: The Fourth Synoptic Gospel", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' 1983 The American Schools of Oriental Research. pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==The historical Jesus==
Some modern scholars believe that the Gospel of Thomas was written independently of the canonical gospels, and therefore is a useful guide to [[historical Jesus]] research.&lt;ref name="Funk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koester 1990 p. 84–6&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars may utilize one of several critical tools in [[biblical criticism|biblical scholarship]], the [[criterion of multiple attestation]], to help build cases for historical reliability of the sayings of Jesus. By finding those sayings in the ''Gospel of Thomas'' that overlap with the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]], Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and Paul, scholars feel such sayings represent "multiple attestations" and therefore are more likely to come from a historical Jesus than sayings that are only singly attested.&lt;ref&gt;Funk 1993 p. 16ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The youth became uncomfortable, for it did not please him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2712">'''Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus''' (3 July 1796, in [[Pfaffroda]] – 22 September 1862, in [[Dresden]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] best known for his [[exegetical]] work on philosophy, such as his characterisation of [[Hegel]]'s [[dialectic]] ("an sich", "fuer sich", "an sich und fuer sich") positing a triad of "[[thesis–antithesis–synthesis]]."

==Biography==
Chalybäus was born at Pfaffroda in [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]]. For some years he taught at the [[knight academy]] in [[Dresden]], and won a high reputation by his lectures on the history of philosophy in Germany. In 1839 he became professor in [[Kiel University]], where, with the exception of one brief interval, when he was expelled with several colleagues because of his German sympathies, he remained till his death.

His first published work, ''Historische Entwicklung der spekulativen Philosophie von Kant bis Hegel'' (1837, 5th ed. 1860), which still ranks among the best expositions of modern German thought, has been twice translated into English, by [[Alfred Tulk]] (London, 1854), and by [[Alfred Edersheim]] (Edinburgh, 1854). His chief works are ''Entwurf eines Systems der Wissenschaftslehre'' (Kiel, 1846) and ''System der spekulativen Ethik'' (2 vols., 1850).

He opposed both the extreme realism of [[Herbart]] and what he regarded as the one-sided idealism of [[Hegel]], and endeavoured to find a mean between them, to discover the ideal or formal principle which unfolds itself in the real or material world presented to it. His ''Wissenschaftslehre'', accordingly, divides itself into

#''Principlehre'', or theory of the one principle;
#''Vermittelungslehre'', or theory of the means by which this principle realizes itself; and 
#''Teleologie''.

The most noticeable point is the position assigned by Chalybäus to the [[World Ether]], which is defined as the infinite in time and space, and which, he thinks, must be posited as necessarily coexisting with the Infinite Spirit or God. The fundamental principle of the ''System der Ethik'' is carried out with great strength of thought, and with an unusually complete command of ethical material.

'''Henri Lefebvre''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|f|ɛ|v|r|ə}}; {{IPA-fr|ləfɛvʁ|lang}}; 16 June 1901&amp;nbsp;– 29 June 1991) was a French [[Marxist]] [[philosopher]] and [[sociology|sociologist]],  best known for pioneering the critique of [[everyday life]], for introducing the concepts of the [[right to the city]] and the production of [[social space]], and for his work on [[dialectics]], [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], and criticism of [[Stalinism]], [[existentialism]], and [[structuralism]]. In his prolific career, Lefebvre wrote more than sixty books and three hundred articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Shields, Rob | title=Lefebvre Love and Struggle | publisher=Routledge | year=1999 |isbn=978-0-415-09370-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lefebvre's book ''The Production of Space'' is the most requested book from the [[British Library|British Library's]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/britishlibrary/status/984356115382226944&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Lefebvre was born in [[Hagetmau]], [[Landes (department)|Landes]], France. He studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris]] (the Sorbonne), graduating in 1920. By 1924 he was working with [[Paul Nizan]], [[Norbert Guterman]], [[Georges Friedmann]], [[Georges Politzer]] and Pierre Morhange in the ''Philosophies'' group seeking a "philosophical revolution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/Trebitsch/pref_lefebvre1_MT.html Michel Trebitsch: ''Introduction to Critique of Everyday Life'', Vol. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608040420/http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/Trebitsch/pref_lefebvre1_MT.html |date=8 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought them into contact with the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], [[Dada]]ists,  and other groups, before they moved towards the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF).

Lefebvre joined the PCF in 1928 and became one of the most prominent French Marxist Intellectuals during the second quarter of the 20th century, before joining the [[French resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Poster, 1975, Existential Marxism in Postwar France: From Sartre to Althusser, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;   From 1944 to 1949, he was the director of ''Radiodiffusion Française'', a French radio broadcaster in [[Toulouse]]. Among his works was a highly influential, anti-Stalinist, text on dialectics called ''Dialectical Materialism'' (1940). Seven years later, Lefebvre published his first volume of ''The Critique of Everyday Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/lefebvre-interview.html|title=Lefebvre on the Situationists: AnInterview|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early work on method was applauded and borrowed centrally by [[Sartre]] in ''The Critique of Dialectical Reason'' (1960). During Lefebvre’s thirty-year stint with the PCF, he was chosen to publish critical attacks on opposed theorists, especially existentialists like Sartre and Lefebvre's former colleague Nizan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2191&amp;editorial_id=9838 Radical Philosophy obituary, Spring 1992] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030626092609/http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2191&amp;editorial_id=9838 |date=26 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; only to intentionally get himself expelled from the party for his own heterodox theoretical and political opinions in the late 1950s. Ironically, he then went from serving as a primary intellectual for the PCF to becoming one of France’s most important critics of the PCF’s politics (e.g. immediately, the lack of an opinion on Algeria, and more generally, the  partial apologism for and continuation of [[Stalinism]]) and intellectual thought (i.e. [[Structuralism]], especially the work of [[Louis Althusser]]).&lt;ref&gt;Henri Lefebvre and Leszek Kołakowski.

In 1961, Lefebvre became professor of sociology at the [[University of Strasbourg]], before joining the faculty at the new university at [[University of Paris X: Nanterre|Nanterre]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/Trebitsch/pref_lefebvre3_MT.html|title=Préface de : Henri Lefebvre, Critique of Everyday Life.

Following the publication of this book, Lefebvre wrote several  influential works on cities, urbanism, and space, including ''The Production of Space'' (1974), which became one of the most influential and heavily cited works of [[urban theory]]. By the 1970s, Lefebvre had also published some of the first critical statements on the work of [[post-structuralists]], especially [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2191&amp;editorial_id=9838 Radical Philosophy obituary, 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030626092609/http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2191&amp;editorial_id=9838 |date=26 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years he was involved in the editorial group of ''Arguments'', a [[New Left]] magazine which largely served to enable the French public to familiarize themselves with Central European revisionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Gombin, Richard | title=The Origins of Modern Leftism |publisher=Penguin | year=1971 | isbn=978-0-14-021846-6}}, p40&lt;/ref&gt;

Lefebvre died in 1991. In his obituary, ''[[Radical Philosophy]]'' magazine honored his long and complex career and influence:
:"the most prolific of French Marxist intellectuals, died during the night of 28–29 June 1991, less than a fortnight after his ninetieth birthday. During his long career, his work has gone in and out of fashion several times, and has influenced the development not only of philosophy but also of sociology, geography, political science and literary criticism."&lt;ref&gt;''Radical Philosophy'' obituary, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The critique of everyday life==
One of Lefebvre's most important contributions to social thought is the idea of the "critique of everyday life," which he pioneered in the 1930s. Lefebvre defined everyday life dialectically as the intersection of "illusion and truth, power and helplessness; the intersection of the sector man controls and the sector he does not control",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lefebvre, Henri | title=The Critique of Everyday Life |publisher=Verso |year=1947 | isbn=978-1844671946}}, p40&lt;/ref&gt; and is where the perpetually transformative conflict occurs between diverse, specific rhythms: the body’s polyrhythmic bundles of natural rhythms, physiological (natural) rhythms, and social rhythms (Lefebvre and Régulier, 1985: 73).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lefebvre, Henri  |author2=Regular, Catherine | title=Rhythmanalysis|publisher=Continuum |year=2004 | isbn=978-0826472991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The everyday was in short, the space in which all life occurred, and between which all fragmented activities took place. It was the residual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/Trebitsch/pref_lefebvre1_MT.html|title=Préface à : Henri Lefebvre, Critique of Everyday Life. Volume I. Introduction|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608040420/http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/Trebitsch/pref_lefebvre1_MT.html|archivedate=8 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the theme presented itself in many works, it was most notably outlined in his eponymous 3 volume study, which came out in individual installments, decades apart, in 1947, 1961, and 1981.

Lefebvre argued that everyday life was an underdeveloped sector compared to technology and production, and moreover that in the mid 20th century, capitalism changed such that everyday life was to be colonized—turned into a zone of sheer consumption. In this zone of everydayness (boredom) shared by everyone in society regardless of class or specialty, autocritique of everyday realities of boredom vs. societal promises of free time and leisure, could lead to  people understanding and then revolutionizing their everyday lives. This was essential to Lefebvre because everyday life was where he saw capitalism surviving and reproducing itself. Without revolutionizing everyday life, capitalism would continue to diminish the quality of everyday life, and inhibit real self-expression. The critique of everyday life was crucial because it was for him only through the development of the conditions of human life—rather than abstract control of productive forces—that humans could reach a concrete utopian existence.&lt;ref&gt;Elden, 2004, pp. 110–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lefebvre's work on everyday life was heavily influential in French theory, particularly for the Situationists, as well as in politics (e.g. for the May 1968 student revolts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ross, Kristin | title=May 68 and its afterlives|publisher=University of Chicago |year=2005 | isbn=978-0226727998}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third volume has also recently influenced scholars writing about digital technology and information in the present day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shaw | first1 = Joe | last2 = Graham | first2 = Mark | title = An Informational Right to the City? Code, Content, Control, and the Urbanization of Information | journal = [[Antipode (journal)|Antipode]] | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 907–927 | doi = 10.1111/anti.12312 | date = February 2017 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;, since it has a section dealing with this topic at length, including analysis of the [[Nora-Minc Report]] ([[:fr:Rapport Nora-Minc|fr]]) (1977); key aspects of [[information theory]]; and other general discussion of the 'colonisation' of everyday life through information communication technologies as 'devices' or 'services'.

==The social production of space==
Lefebvre dedicated a great deal of his philosophical writings to understanding the importance of (the production of) space in what he called the reproduction of social relations of production. This idea is the central argument in the book ''The Survival of Capitalism'', written as a sort of prelude to {{lang|fr|La Production de l'espace}} (1974) (''The Production of Space''). These works have deeply influenced current urban theory, mainly within human geography, as seen in the current work of authors such as [[David Harvey]], [[Dolores Hayden]], and [[Edward Soja]], and in the contemporary discussions around the notion of [[spatial justice]]. Lefebvre is widely recognized as a Marxist thinker who was responsible for widening considerably the scope of Marxist theory, embracing everyday life and the contemporary meanings and implications of the ever-expanding reach of the urban in the western world throughout the 20th century. The generalization of industry, and its relation to cities (which is treated in {{lang|fr|La Pensée marxiste et la ville}}), ''The Right to the City'' and ''The Urban Revolution'' were all themes of Lefebvre's writings in the late 1960s, which was concerned, among other aspects, with the deep transformation of "the city" into "the urban" which culminated in its omni-presence (the "complete urbanization of society").

Lefebvre contends that there are different modes of production of space (i.e. [[spatialization]]) from natural space ('absolute space') to more complex spaces and flows whose meaning is produced in a social way (i.e. social space).&lt;ref&gt;''Place, A Short Introduction'' by Tim Cresswell&lt;/ref&gt;  Lefebvre analyses each historical mode as a three-part dialectic between everyday practices and perceptions ({{lang|fr|le perçu}}), representations or theories of space ({{lang|fr|le conçu}}) and the spatial [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)#French culture|imaginary]] of the time ({{lang|fr|le vécu}}).&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Rob, ''Places on the Margin'', Routledge, 1991, {{ISBN|0-415-08022-3}}, pp. 50–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lefebvre's argument in ''The Production of Space'' is that space is a social product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. This argument implies the shift of the research perspective from space to processes of its production; the embrace of the multiplicity of spaces that are socially produced and made productive in social practices; and the focus on the contradictory, conflictual, and, ultimately, political character of the processes of production of space.&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, Lukasz, ''Henri Lefebvre on Space: Architecture, Urban Research, and the Production of Theory'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2011, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; As a Marxist theorist (but highly critical of the economic structuralism that dominated the academic discourse in his period), Lefebvre argues that this social production of urban space is fundamental to the reproduction of society, hence of capitalism itself. The social production of space is commanded by a [[hegemonic]] class as a tool to reproduce its dominance (see [[Antonio Gramsci]]).

{{Quote|(Social) space is a (social) product&amp;nbsp;[...] the space thus produced also serves as a tool of thought and of action&amp;nbsp;[...] in addition to being a means of production it is also a means of control, and hence of domination, of power.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri, ''The Production of Space'', Blackwell, 1991, {{ISBN|0-631-18177-6}}. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lefebvre argued that every society—and, therefore, every mode of production—produces a certain space, its own space. The city of the ancient world cannot be understood as a simple agglomeration of people and things in space—it had its own spatial practice, making its own space (which was suitable for itself—Lefebvre argues that the intellectual climate of the city in the ancient world was very much related to the social production of its spatiality). Then if every society produces its own space, any "social existence" aspiring to be or declaring itself to be real, but not producing its own space, would be a strange entity, a very peculiar abstraction incapable of escaping the ideological or even cultural spheres. Based on this argument, Lefebvre criticized Soviet urban planners on the basis that they failed to produce a socialist space, having just reproduced the modernist model of urban design (interventions on physical space, which were insufficient to grasp social space) and applied it onto that context:

{{Quote|Change life! Change Society! These ideas lose completely their meaning without producing an appropriate space. A lesson to be learned from soviet constructivists from the 1920s and 30s, and of their failure, is that new social relations demand a new space, and vice-versa.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri ''The Production of Space'', Blackwell, 1991, {{ISBN|0-631-18177-6}}. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Criticism and response ===
In his book ''The Urban Question'', [[Manuel Castells]] criticizes Lefebvre's [[Marxist Humanism]] and approach to the city influenced by [[Hegel]] and [[Nietzsche]]. Castells' political criticisms of Lefebvre's approach to Marxism echoed the Structuralist ''Scientific Marxism'' school of Louis Althusser of which Lefebvre was an immediate critic. Many responses to Castells are provided in ''The Survival of Capitalism'', and some may argue {{who|date=May 2010}} that the acceptance of those critiques in the academic world would be a motive for Lefebvre's effort in writing the long and theoretically dense ''The Production of Space''.

'''''Human, All Too Human''''' is a three-part 1999 [[documentary television series]] co-produced by the [[BBC]] and RM Arts.&lt;ref name=EuroArts&gt;{{cite web|title=Human, All Too Human (8679)|url=http://www.euroarts.com/artikel/tvdistribution/?id=008679_human_all_too_human|publisher=EuroArts|accessdate=2 July 2013|quote=This lucid series tells the stories of Nietzsche, Heidegger and Sartre, three men who spent their lives in search of a philosophy that would make sense of this bewildering new world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It follows the lives of three prominent European [[philosopher]]s: [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref name=EuroArts /&gt; The theme revolves heavily around the school of philosophical thought known as [[Existentialism]], although the term had not been coined at the time of Nietzsche's writing and Heidegger declaimed the label.

The documentary is named after the 1878 book written by Nietzsche, titled ''[[Human, All Too Human|Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits]]'' (in German: ''Menschliches, Allzumenschliches: Ein Buch für freie Geister'').&lt;ref name=Wicks_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wicks|first=Robert|title=Friedrich Nietzsche|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/|date=29 April 2011|accessdate=2 July 2013|editor1-first=Edward N|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-link=Edward N.

*'''Episode 2: ''Thinking the Unthinkable''''' centers around [[Martin Heidegger]], who developed ideas from the writings and ideas of Nietzsche in an attempt to better understand individual human freedom. Before and after the reign of the Nazis in Germany, Heidegger spent much of his time living in [[solitude]] in the hill of [[Todtnauberg]] to allow himself to clear his mind and better focus on his own philosophy. Due to the fact that he was a member of the Nazi Party from 1933 until the end of [[World War II]], his works were dismissed by his critics as Nazi propaganda.
*'''Episode 3: ''The Road to Freedom''''' describes the life of the French philosopher, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. This is when the term ''[[existentialism]]'' begins to enter the realm of philosophy. The documentary shows that Sartre believes it is up to each individual human being to give his or her own life a meaning and a purpose.

'''Igor Semyonovich Kon''' ({{lang-ru|Игорь Семёнович Кон}}; 21 May 1928 &amp;ndash; 27 April 2011) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russia]]n [[philosopher]], [[psychologist]], and [[sexologist]]. His scientific publications have been translated into many languages, such as English, German, and French.

==Biography==
Kon was born in Leningrad (now [[St. Petersburg]]). He was evacuated during the [[Siege of Leningrad]] and returned after the lifting of the blockade in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Gretsov, Andrey (2000). [http://www.psychology.spb.ru/articles/kon.htm "Interview with Igor Semyonovich Kon".] [[St. Petersburg State University]] Department of Psychology. Retrieved 2 March 2011. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Herzen University|Herzen State Pedagogical University]] with a degree in [[history]] in 1947 and was awarded a [[candidate of sciences]] degree by the same university in 1950. He was awarded the [[Doktor nauk|doctor of sciences]] degree by [[Leningrad State University]] in 1959.

Kon worked at a variety of academic institutions between 1950 and 1974, holding positions at the [[Vologda Pedagogical Institute]] in 1950-52, the Leningrad Chemical-Pharmaceutical Institute (now [[St. Petersburg State Chemical-Pharmaceutical Academy]]) in 1953-56, Leningrad State University (now [[St. Petersburg State University]]) in 1956-67, the Institute of Philosophy of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] in 1967-68, the Institute of Concrete Social Research of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (now Institute of Sociology of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]) in 1968-72, and the Institute of Social Sciences in 1972-74. He has been chief researcher of the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology at the Russian Academy of Sciences since 1974.

Kon was one of the first Soviet scholars to write textbooks on [[sociology]]. He is most famous as an expert on [[sexology]] and [[Reproductive health|sexual health]]. He started studying these matters in the middle of the 1960s. His ''Vvedeniye v seksologiyu'' (''Introduction to Sexology''; 1988, 2005) was written as a textbook for universities.

He believed that sexology cannot be confined to the bounds of medical problems, but rather is an independent interdisciplinary science rather than a branch of medicine. Interviewed by Sarah Keller for his profile in a 1989 issue of the [[United States|American]] magazine ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', Kon stated:{{cquote|&lt;blockquote&gt;Attitudes [toward sexual awareness] among American and Soviet right-wing people are very similar. [Opponents in the United States complain of] a dirty communist conspiracy to undermine the morals of sound youth. In our country, it is called a dirty industrialist conspiracy to undermine the morals of Soviet youth.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Sarah. "Guru of Glands''nost''". [https://books.google.com/books?id=DOcDAAAAMBAJ ''Mother Jones'', Vol. 14, #2] (February–March 1989) pg. 14; ISSN 0362-8841&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;|}} Kon was a member of numerous scientific societies, including the [[International Academy of Sex Research]], the  [[European Association of Experimental Social Psychology]], the [[International Sociological Association]], the  [[Polish Academy of Sex Research]], and the [[European Association for Adolescent Psychology]].&lt;ref name="HRH Conference 2010"&gt;[http://www.lgbtconference.lv/en/conference/speakers/ Human Rights and Homosexuality, Past Present and Future: Speakers and Moderators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605031400/http://www.lgbtconference.lv/en/conference/speakers/ |date=2010-06-05 }} (2010). Retrieved 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the International Advisory Board of the [[German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rolf-gindorf.de/english/e_dgss.htm German Society for Social Scientific Sexuality Research (DGSS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323220436/http://www.rolf-gindorf.de/english/e_dgss.htm |date=2011-03-23 }}. Retrieved 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Igor Kon died in Moscow, aged 82, in 2011, from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rian.ru/science/20110427/368887071.html Скончался известный социолог, философ и сексолог Игорь Кон]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gayrussia.eu/en/russia/1263/ Top Russian sexologist Igor Kon died] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503171727/http://www.gayrussia.eu/en/russia/1263/ |date=2011-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgbtnet.ru/news/detail.php?ID=4686.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
'''''Iki''''' (いき, English: roughly "chic, stylish") is a concept in aesthetics, the basis of which is thought to have formed among urbane commoners ([[chōnin]]) in [[Edo]] in the [[Edo period|Tokugawa period]].&lt;ref name="nussbaum379"&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Iki''{{-"}} in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 379|page=379}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iki'' is sometimes misunderstood as simply "[[Cool Japan|anything Japanese]]" overseas, but it is actually a specific aesthetic ideal, distinct from more ethereal notions of transcendence or poverty. As such, [[samurai]], for example, would typically, as a class, be considered devoid of ''iki'' (see ''[[yabo]]''). At the same time, individual warriors are often depicted in contemporary popular imagination as embodying the ''iki'' ideals of a clear, stylish manner and blunt, unwavering directness. The term became widespread in modern intellectual circles through the book ''[[The Structure of Iki]]'' (1930) by [[Kuki Shūzō]].

==Interpretation==
''Iki'', having emerged from the worldly [[Japanese merchant class]], may appear in some ways a more contemporary expression of Japanese aesthetics than concepts such as ''[[wabi-sabi]]''. The term is commonly used in conversation and writing, but is not necessarily exclusive of other categories of beauty.

''Iki'' is an expression of simplicity, sophistication, spontaneity, and originality. It is ephemeral, romantic, straightforward, measured, audacious, smart, and lacking in detrimental self-consciousness.

''Iki'' is not overly refined, pretentious, complicated, showy, slick, coquettish, or, generally, [[Kawaii|cute]]. At the same time, ''iki'' may exhibit any of those traits in a smart, direct, and unabashed manner.

''Iki'' may signify a personal trait, or artificial phenomena exhibiting human will or consciousness. ''Iki'' is not used to describe natural phenomena, but may be expressed in human appreciation of natural beauty, or in the nature of human beings. [[Murakami Haruki]] (b. 1949), who writes in a clear, unflinching style—at turns sentimental, fantastic, and surreal—is described as embodying ''iki''. In contrast, [[Kawabata Yasunari]] (1899-1972) writes in a more poetic vein, with a closer focus on the interior "complex" of his characters, while situations and surroundings exhibit a kind of ''[[wabi-sabi]]''. That said, stylistic differences may tend to distract from a similar emotional subjectivity. Indeed, ''iki'' is strongly tied to stylistic tendencies.

==''Tsū''==
The indefinite ideal of '''tsū''' (通) can be said to reference a highly cultivated but not necessarily solemn sensibility. The ''iki''/''tsu'' sensibility resists being construed within the context of overly specific rules about what could be considered as vulgar or uncouth.&lt;ref&gt;Gallaher, John. ''Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance, and Art.'' p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Iki'' and ''tsu'' are considered synonymous in some situations, but ''tsu'' exclusively refers to persons, while ''iki'' can also refer to situations/objects. In both ideals, the property of refinement is not academic in nature. ''Tsu'' sometimes involves excessive obsession and cultural (but not academic) pedantry, and in this case, it differs from ''iki'', which will not be obsessive. ''Tsu'' is used, for example, for knowing how to properly appreciate (eat) Japanese cuisines ([[sushi]], [[tempura]], [[soba]] etc.). ''Tsu'' (and some ''iki''-style) can be transferred from person to person in form of "tips." As ''tsu'' is more focused in knowledge, it may be considered superficial from ''iki'' point of view, since ''iki'' cannot be easily attained by learning.

==''Yabo''==
{{main|Yabo}}

''[[Yabo]]'' (野暮) is the antonym of ''iki''. ''Busui'' (無粋), literally "non-''iki''," is synonymous to ''yabo''.

==''Sui''==
In the [[Kamigata]] or [[Kansai]] area, the ideal of ''sui'' is prevalent. ''Sui'' is also represented by the [[kanji]] "粋". The sense of ''sui'' is similar to ''iki'' but not identical, reflecting various regional differences.&lt;ref name="nussbaum379"/&gt; The contexts of their usages are also different.

'''Integrational Linguistics''' ('''IL''') is a general approach to [[linguistics]] that has been developed by the German linguist [[Hans-Heinrich Lieb]] and others since the late 1960s. The term "Integrational Linguistics" as a name for this approach has been used in publications since 1977&lt;ref name="Lieb 1977e"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1977. ''Outline of Integrational Linguistics: Preliminary version''. Berlin: Freie Universität Berlin, Fachbereich Germanistik. (Linguistische Arbeiten und Berichte [LAB] Berlin (West) 9).&lt;/ref&gt; and antedates the use of the same term for [[integrationism]], an unrelated approach developed by [[Roy Harris (linguist)|Roy Harris]].&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006"&gt;Sackmann, Robin. 2006. "Integrational Linguistics (IL)". In: Keith Brown (ed.-in-chief). ''Encyclopedia of language and linguistics''. 2nd edition. Oxford: Elsevier. Vol.5. 704–713.&lt;/ref&gt; Integrational Linguistics continues being developed by an open group of linguists from various countries.&lt;ref name="Lieb History"&gt;[http://integrational-linguistics.science/+en/hist-en.html Lieb, Hans-Heinrich: "History of Integrational Linguistics: a short outline"]. ''The Homepage of Integrational Linguistics''. (Retrieved April 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Over the past decades, IL has developed two major linguistic theories: (i) a general theory of language (the [[integrational theory of language]]) that covers both the systematic features of language systems and the phenomenon of language variability in a unified way, and (ii) a theory of grammars (the [[integrational theory of grammars]]), understood as part of a theory of [[linguistic description]]s. The separation of a theory of language from a theory of grammars is a major feature of IL by which it differs from approaches with a [[Generative Grammar|generative]] orientation. After an initial emphasis on the integrational theory of grammars till the mid-1970s, work in IL has been characterized by a steady and continuous refinement of the integrational theory of language based on [[empirical data]] from [[linguistic typology|typologically]] diverse languages, avoiding basic revisions as they occurred in Chomskyan [[generative grammar]].&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb History" /&gt;

The most comprehensive presentation of IL to date is Lieb (1983).&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1983. ''Integrational Linguistics. Vol. I: General Outline''. Amsterdam; Philadelphia: Benjamins. (= Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 17).&lt;/ref&gt; This book contains both a theory of grammars and a general theory of language comprising a general [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], morphosemantics, [[lexical semantics]], [[syntax]], and sentential semantics; a general [[phonology]] has been added by Lieb (1998,&lt;ref name="Lieb 1998b"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1998.

''Prospects for a New Structuralism''. Amsterdam; Philadelphia: Benjamins. (= Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 96).&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time, IL is closest among modern approaches to Western grammatical tradition.&lt;ref name="Lieb History" /&gt;

Integrational Linguistics has its own multilingual website, [http://www.integrational-linguistics.science ''The Homepage of Integrational Linguistics''], which contains, among other resources, a comprehensive [http://integrational-linguistics.science/biblio.html ''Bibliography of Integrational Linguistics''] as well as information about linguists currently working within this approach.

==Main features==
IL is not a theory but an ''approach'' within general linguistics, i.e. the branch of linguistics which studies all languages and aims at developing a general theory of language.

Accordingly, IL has developed a comprehensive theoretical framework for the description of arbitrary languages. From its inception, this framework has been a non-generative and non-transformational, but rather declarative formal framework for studying all aspects of language and languages. IL provides an axiomatically formulated theory of language, which currently covers, in particular, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and language variability.

IL is a ''non-generative'' and ''non-transformational'' approach in linguistics: it assumes neither "deep structures" nor transformational relations between sequentially ordered structures.&lt;ref name="Lieb History" /&gt; Rather, IL conceives linguistic entities as interrelated, "multidimensional" objects, which are typically modelled as set-theoretic constructs.&lt;ref name="Nolda &amp; Teuber 2011"&gt;Nolda, Andreas; and Oliver Teuber (2011). "Introduction: Multiple dimensions in syntax and morphology". In: Andreas Nolda, and Oliver Teuber (eds.). ''Syntax and Morphology Multidimensional''. Berlin: de Gruyter Mouton. (= Interface Explorations 24). 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

IL is opposed to basic assumptions that characterize linguistic [[cognitivism (learning theory)|cognitivism]] in its 'non-intentionalist' varieties: the objects of linguistics are construed not as mental or [[neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] mechanisms or corresponding 'representations,' but as natural languages conceived as abstract, extramental entities; a grammar of a language is an empirical [[theory]] (ideally, an empirical axiomatic theory) of that language, in a sense of 'theory' that requires sets of statements among the theory's components&lt;ref name="Lieb 1974a/1976c"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1974/1976. "Grammars as theories: the case for axiomatic grammar". Part I: ''Theoretical Linguistics'' 1. 39–115. Part II: ''Theoretical Linguistics'' 3. 1–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the traditional generative as well as the more recent cognitive conceptions of grammars as [[algorithm]]s are rejected: from the very beginning, grammars were construed in IL not as algorithms but as 'declarative' theories (theories that make claims formulated as statements, and carefully keep apart a description from the entities described), a position that is currently being seriously considered also in other approaches. Natural languages are seen to arise from abstract, extramental objects (such as [[phone (phonetics)|phonetic sounds]]). However, these objects are associated with concrete physical events (such as [[utterance]]s of phonetic sound sequences) and are involved in the content of mental states or events that are connected with language use and knowledge. IL is thus compatible with a non-cognitivist, 'intentionalist' mentalism that may be proposed as typical of a 'New Structuralism' (Lieb 1992a,&lt;ref name="Lieb 1992e"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1992. "Prospects for a New Structuralism: Introduction". In: Hans-Heinrich Lieb (ed.). ''Prospects for a New Structuralism''. Amsterdam; Philadelphia: Benjamins. (= Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 96). 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt; 1992b&lt;ref name="Lieb 1992f"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1992. "The case for a New Structuralism". In: Hans-Heinrich Lieb (ed.). ''Prospects for a New Structuralism''. Amsterdam; Philadelphia: Benjamins. (= Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 96). 33–72.&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;

Given these characteristics, the common but rather constrained distinction between '[[formal grammar|formalist]],' '[[functionalist linguistics|functionalist]],' and '[[cognitive linguistics|cognitivist]]' schools of linguistics does not apply to IL, which exhibits features of all three kinds of approaches. Major advantages of IL may be seen in (i) the fact that it was developed in view of the full spectrum of linguistic diversity from the outset, (ii) its integration of all levels of linguistic description (from phonetics to sentence semantics) within a unified theoretical framework, (iii) its inclusion of both system-based and non-system-based properties of languages, (iv) its development both of a theory of language and a theory of linguistic descriptions, and (v) the ontological explicitness and consistency of all its theories, making it a framework suitable for the description of individual languages as well as for contrastive linguistics, linguistic typology and universals research.&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;

IL adopts a positive and constructive attitude toward Western linguistic tradition and regards itself as a part of this tradition. In syntax and morphology, the [[Integrational Theory of Language]] centers around a formally explicit, consistent, and vastly enriched version of theoretical conceptions underlying actual grammar writing since antiquity, embedding them in a broader scientific context that comprises linguistics and its neighboring disciplines; and the [[Integrational Theory of Grammars]] applies modern means to account for the intricacies of actual descriptive work.&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;

Integrational Linguistics strives for logical soundness even in informal descriptions and makes extensive use of naive set theory in formulating its theories in order to achieve explicitness and clarity.&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;

==Motivation for the name "integrational linguistics"==
The term 'integrational' is motivated by the following 'integrative' features of the approach as a whole:&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;
# Linguistics is construed as a well-defined discipline in its own right but is also placed within a wider system of interrelated disciplines. Contrary to the conceptions proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]], which reduced linguistics first to [[psychology]] and later to [[biology]], IL adopts a non-[[Reductionism#Reductionism and science|reductionist]] stance: such disciplines as biology, psychology, [[sociology]], and [[anthropology]] are conceived as neighboring disciplines of linguistics, disciplines that each share a branch with linguistics ([[biolinguistics]], [[psycholinguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]], etc.); and linguistics itself is construed as a branch of (human) [[semiotics]].
# A broad view of linguistic [[wikt:subject-matter|subject matter]] is taken: linguistics deals with all aspects of natural languages that are directly or indirectly relevant to their use. This includes not only systematic aspects of languages, i.e., aspects related to structural properties of 'linguistic systems' in a traditional sense, but also the internal variability of languages; the relationship between languages and the structure of the societies in which they are used; the relationship between [[communication]] in a language and actions by, or psychological processes in, a speaker; the neurophysiological and psychological foundations for learning and mastering a language; and aspects of the development and decline of languages.
# It is assumed that each major aspect of natural languages (the morphological, the syntactic, the semantic, etc.) must be characterized in its own right, which includes showing its interrelations with other aspects. This is achieved in IL by developing separate but interrelated theories for each major aspect (Integrational Morphology, Integrational Syntax, etc.) that form coherent parts of a larger 'Integrational Theory of Language Systems' (see below).
# A non-linguistic theory (e.g., a psychological or sociological theory) may be integrated with a theory of language, and relevant parts of a general theory of language are, as a rule, integrated with each language description (itself a theory of one or more individual languages or language varieties): the language description is formulated 'in terms of' a theory of language, that is, it incorporates and employs terms, definitions, assumptions, and theorems from the underlying general theory. This idea of 'theory integration' is made precise in the [[Integrational Theory of Grammars]].

==History==
Integrational Linguistics is an approach to linguistics that has arisen mainly from work done by Hans-Heinrich Lieb since roughly 1965. From its inception, Integrational Linguistics has been non-generative.&lt;ref name="Lieb History" /&gt;

Lieb's early work, culminating in Lieb (1970),&lt;ref name="Lieb 1970c"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1970. ''Sprachstadium und Sprachsystem: Umrisse einer Sprachtheorie''. Stuttgart etc.: Kohlhammer.&lt;/ref&gt; was directed towards that part of a theory of language that deals with language-internal variability, especially with variability in time. As such, it was opposed to the general orientation of linguistics in the sixties and early seventies where language variability was programmatically disregarded. The integrational treatment of language variability has later been continued, and to some extent completed, in Lieb (1993).&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993g"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1993. ''Linguistic variables: Towards a unified theory of linguistic variation''. Amsterdam; Philadelphia: Benjamins. (= Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 108).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970 framework for language variability did not include a theory of language systems. In 1972, Lieb began work on a general syntax as part of a theory of language systems. At the same time he was also working on a theory of grammars conceived as part of a theory of linguistic description not of a theory of language. In the [[Integrational Theory of Grammars]], the traditional modern conception of grammars as algorithms was rejected in favour of a conception that has later become known as 'declarative grammar'. The integrational format of grammars construed as empirical axiomatic theories (Lieb 1974, 1976)&lt;ref name="Lieb 1974a/1976c" /&gt; is also characterized in Lieb (1983: Part G),&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b" /&gt; and more briefly in Lieb (1989).&lt;ref name="Lieb 1989"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1989. "Integrational grammars: An integrative view of grammar writing". In: Gottfried Graustein, and Gerhard Leitner (eds). ''Reference grammars and modern linguistic theory''. Tübingen: Niemeyer. (= Linguistische Arbeiten 226). 205–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Lieb founded a research group at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]] for further developing a general syntax as part of a theory of language. Under his direction, the group did work both on a general syntax and on the syntax of German from 1972 to 1982. Since 1992 there has again been a regular research colloquium at the Freie Universität Berlin working on problems of Integrational Linguistics.&lt;ref name="Lieb History" /&gt;

Differently from other approaches, there have been no abrupt changes of direction in Integrational Linguistics. By now the theory of language developed in Integrational Linguistics has grown into an in-depth theory of all major aspects of language, and its application to a number of different and unrelated languages of the world is in progress.&lt;ref name="Lieb History" /&gt;

So far, the following languages have been or are being studied from an integrational point of view: [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Riang language|Yinchia]], [[Guarani language|Guaraní]], [[Aweti people|Aweti]].&lt;ref name="Lieb History" /&gt;

'''Ivan Vladimirovich Lopukhin''' ({{lang-ru|Ива́н Влади́мирович Лопухи́н}}) (February 24, 1756, [[Oryol Governorate]]–June 22, 1816, Oryol Governorate) was an Imperial Russian philosopher, mystic, writer and humanitarian.

Born to the wealthy [[Lopukhin family]] in 1756 in Voskreskenskoye, Lopukhin joined the [[Preobrazhensky Lifeguard regiment]] in 1775. He retired a colonel 7 years later due to health concerns. After serving as a counselor and later court president on the [[Moscow]] Criminal court between 1782 and 1785, he was introduced to [[rosicrucianism]], [[martinism]] and [[freemasonry]]&lt;ref&gt;Raffaella Faggionato ''A Rosicrucian Utopia in Eighteenth-Century Russia'' Springer, the Netherlands 1997&lt;/ref&gt; through his friend [[Nikolay Novikov]] and began a career as a writer and printer, while entering civil service. He became [[Senator]] in 1798.

In 1801, Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] asked Lopukhin to investigate complaints by the [[Doukhobors]], his reports in 1802 leading to their resettlement on the [[Molochna River|Molochnaya River]], along with other religious minorities.

'''Johann Ge Moll''' (born '''Timen Timev''', Plovdiv, Bulgaria)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanthoughtbeam.com/about-johann-ge-moll.html|title=About Johann Ge Moll|publisher=humanthoughtbeam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; nom de plume in English, (as Materius Rosencroytz, Anubis author pseudonyms in Bulgarian) is best known for concepts ''Desemantism - Omni-semantism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://signquantumcontinuum.com|title=Desemantism - Omni-semantism}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by him in [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]] and [[semiology]]. He is also known for his investigations on "the relationships of Wave Function" and  "Perception Function", where Perception Function builds time Present, as Wave Function builds time Future.

What marks him as distinguish scholar is a pioneer attempt for synthesis and unification of [[Psychology]], [[Quantum Physics]] and [[Linguistics]], presented as “Symmetry of psychological, physical and linguistic worlds”.

“On the basis of his immensely broad investigations and his creative artistic experience he has proposed a synthesis of nearly all the ruling disciplines… Dr. Ge Moll may one day be a voice that is heard in America” ([[William Lovitt]], professor of philosophy, [[California State University]], Sacramento)

His proposal for hypothesis of “Objective Psyche of the Universe and Subjective Psyche of Man”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signquantumcontinuum.com/new_hypothesis.php#hyp|title=New Hypotesis - Objective psyche of the Univerce}}&lt;/ref&gt; where distinction between “Subjective Psyche, Subjective Physics and Objective Psyche” draw the new way of theorization and cogitative praxis of “Hearing the Essences” as “Concepts-phony” and build the new way of thought, sensibility and cognizing.

He is also known by his works on psychology, linguistic psychoanalysis, (“History of linguistic hypocrisy” 1992) quantum psychology, philosophy of quantum physics (“Libido Significandi, second volume, “Sign Quantum Continuum” 2005, 2009), theory of literature, [[brain research]], and his broad spectrum of writings - poetry, dramaturgy, novels, essay and c.t.r.

==Early life and education==
'''Johann Ge Moll''' is Plovdiv, Bulgaria-born  psychiatrist, writer, philosopher, and violinist, a scientist with an encyclopedic scope of knowledge, and religious philosopher, more popular abroad than in Bulgaria.

He studies medicine in [[Sankt-Peterburg]], Russia and Bulgaria and took his degree as doctor of Medicine in Medical Academy, Sofia. He works as [[psychiatrist]] and teaches History of Philosophy, [[Psychoanalysis]], Philosophy of Music and creative Writing in Bulgarian and American universities.

He rises to popularity during the 1990s following the publication of his books The Revolt of the Mediocrities, A History of Linguistic Hypocrisy, Anti-Faust, Alchemy of Language, etc. He has published 21 poetry books and 12 plays. He has also written over 20,000 pages of tracts in [[ontology]], logics, ethics, aesthetics, transcendental psychology, sociology, [[semiotics]], hermeneutics.

He has created a theoretical model for a '''non-repressive civilisation''', a model of the brain and the [[superconsciousness]], a new interpretation of  the quantum mathematics and cosmology, systems for automatic poetry and automatic stylistics, systems for meditation and heuristic-creative techniques, a hypothesis for the symmetrical-syntax correlative between the Universe and the Mind, a hypothesis for the ultramicroscopic universal objective psyche, world memory and quantum-mechanic collective inter-ego.

He has also founded a new philosophical movement – '''Omnisematicism''', a new international youth intellectual movement for new logical and passionate revolution Omnirealism. He has set the foundations of a new science – Alphysics, he has developed a Non-Self-Identical Ontology, Nihilistic Physics, Permutative Hermeneutics.

==Further information==
Johann Ge Moll’s theoretical work is dedicated to the search for the Great Synthesis between Science and Art, which negates Dilthey’s distinction between natural sciences and humanities. His basic philosophical concept is overcoming the "human" and its transcendenting through a mutating humanism towards a transhuman cosmic reason. This concept acquaints us with the incomprehensible harmony between the inhumanity of knowledge in man and the unreason of man in knowledge.

The philosopher preaches that Clarity, Authenticity, Incontrovertibility, Confidence, Conviction – those pillars of logics are attributes not of thought, but of fascination. They are the eyes not of a soberer, but of a hypnotic, which hope to find Truth under their features, but instead discover Beauty. In out blind hypnotic pursuance of human thought after Language and Sign we unmask its thirst for extonation and de-essentialization (assimilation of our essence in the Supreme). This is why it is time, he calls, to accuse Western Metaphysics' whole methodology of desire to Bewitch. This is  why we no longer need to hide the fact that rationalism has always been merely a pretext for aestheticism.

J. Ge Moll defines “human” as a world theft of the Object’s self-knowledge. Subjectivity is born of this ontological theft’s constitution. This is why cognition is sin, because it is the world’s Mentality which man and evolution have appropriated. And the only way for man to redeem himself for this sin he has committed before the Universe and achieve salvation, is to restore the Intelligence he stole from the Substances through evolution, and to restore them to the Universe. The subjectivity, criminally stolen and appropriated by him

According to Ge Moll man should also be tried with the crimes of the humanistic reduction, through which the Cosmic Reason and Sensitivity are reduced to human reason. Thus, the major prerequisite and condition for the mind to be elevated to the philosophy of the Thinking Substance, joyful energy and Intelligent Object is the requirement for overcoming Man and the human. Subjectivity, he teaches, which has separated (for the purposes of its narcissism) the Flower from the Thought, has a duty to restore the unity of the Thinking Flower. This statement of his has led his students to call his teaching The Philosophy of the Thinking Flower.

Thus, through antinomy,Ge Moll extricates the theory of the joyous energy and the worrisome form. This is why his teaching is called Joyous Insolubilionism. Via this “joyous insolubility” he defends the concept of a rational mysticism, which explains the world through the sacrament of cognition.

'''Julian Daizan Skinner''' (Juran Daizan 寿鸞 大山), (born 22 November 1963) is a British Rinzai Zen Buddhist Rōshi in the Zendo Kyodan lineage. He has also received [[Dharma Transmission]] in the Sōtō tradition of Zen. Daizan Roshi is the founder of the Zenways Sangha and resident teacher at Yugagyo Dojo ([http://www.zenyoga.org.uk Zen Yoga Camberwell]) in London, United Kingdom.

== Biography ==
Skinner was born in Chatham, UK in 1963 and grew up in Kent. After graduation, he worked as a scientist in the pharmaceuticals industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zenways.org/about/about-julian-daizan-skinner/&lt;/ref&gt;  He began studying [[Sōtō]] Zen under Rev. Master Daishin Morgan at [http://www.throssel.org.uk/ Throssel Hole Buddhist Abbey] in Northumberland in northern England. Given permission to enter full-time monastic training as a postulant in 1989, he was ordained as an [[unsui]] or novice monk on 4 April 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Throssel Hole Priory Vol. 18,2, summer 1991 p24&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting on his time at the monastery, Daizan wrote, "For fourteen formative years I studied with him [Daishan Morgan], before continuing elsewhere with [[Rinzai]] Zen".

Within Zen monastic society, the hierarchy is all-pervading and rigid. For the first seven years he lived in the [[zendo]], the meditation hall, with three by six feet of space on the meditation platform and two cupboards, one for bedding and one for robes. Daizan Rōshi reflects: "As junior monks, we were almost never alone. Every action 24 hours a day was expected to be obedient to instructions, undertaken mindfully and with consideration for others. The monastery is a pressured environment. The image used to exemplify it was the rock tumbler; the months and years of living cheek by jowl gradually smooth off all the rough corners so that each monk becomes a polished jewel.”&lt;ref&gt;The Middle Way Vol 85, No 3 November 2010 p182&lt;/ref&gt; He received dharma transmission on 21 December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Throssel Hole Priory Winter 1995, vol 22, 4, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Daizan began training with [[Rinzai]] Zen Master [[Shinzan Miyamae Roshi|Shinzan Miyamae Rōshi]] of Gyokuryuji Temple in Gifu, central Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://calligraphyzen.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was the former hermitage of the outstanding Rinzai Zen reformer [[Bankei Yōtaku|Bankei Yōtaku Zenji]] (1622–1693). [[Shinzan Miyamae Roshi|Shinzan Rōshi]], something of a maverick in the modern Zen world, intended the tiny temple to provide a basis of true Zen training outside the Rinzai mainstream which has become increasingly focused on providing high-price funerals.  Daizan eventually became fukujushoku, vice-abbott, continued his study of zazen and zen [[yoga]] and studied the [[kōan]] curriculum of the Mino branch of the Inzan lineage of Rinzai Zen, completing it in 2007. On 8 May 2007 Daizan received [[inka (dharma)|inka]] from Shinzan Rōshi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zenways.org/from-julian-8/&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the UK to begin teaching Zen.

On midsummer morning (21 June) 2007 Daizan Rōshi began a walk from the south tip of the Isle of Wight to the northern tip of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Oxfordshire Courier Thursday July 5th 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing his monastic robes and [[Kasa (hat)|kasa]] (hat) and carrying no money, Daizan Rōshi walked up the centre of the island of Britain finishing on Cape Wrath at the north of Scotland. The 777 mile walk took 64 days.&lt;ref&gt;The Middle Way Vol 84 no 1 May 2009 p19&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2011, he was installed as resident teacher at Yugagyo Dojo ([http://www.zenyoga.org.uk Zen Yoga Camberwell]) in London. The event was presided over by [[Shinzan Miyamae Roshi|Shinzan Rōshi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zenways.org/training-hall/&lt;/ref&gt; He has served as a resident teacher at the Buddhist Society in London &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebuddhistsociety.org/groups/Living%20the%20Dharma.html&lt;/ref&gt; and is an appointed trainer with the [http://www.mindfulcollege.com College of Mindful Clinicians]. He has been involved in Zen teaching at Oxford University and is particularly involved in the “Managing Your Mind” programme of postdoctoral study.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/skills/courses/managing-your-mind&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015 Daizan Rōshi, together with co-translator Sumiko Hayashi, published the book "In Heaven's River: Poems and Carvings of Mountain-Monk Enku", a tribute to the life and art of [[Enkū]], the 17th century Japanese itinerant wonder-working mountain monk, sculptor, and poet. In July 2015, he published the book "The Zen Character: Life, Art and Teachings of Zen Master Shinzan Miyamae" to coincide with [[Shinzan Miyamae Roshi|Shinzan Rōshi's]] 80th birthday and an exhibition of his calligraphy in London. In June 2017, [[Jessica Kingsley Publishers|Singing Dragon Press]] published Daizan's third book "Practical Zen: Meditation and Beyond".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3259">'''Louis Isaac de Beausobre''' (19 August 1730 – 3 December 1783) was a German philosopher and political economist of French [[Huguenot]] descent. He was born in [[Berlin]], the son of the French Protestant churchman and ecclesiastical historian [[Isaac de Beausobre]] and his second wife, Charlotte Schwarz. He is not to be confused with his elder half-brother, the pastor and theologian Charles Louis de Beausobre (1690–1753).

Beausobre was educated at the [[Französisches Gymnasium Berlin|Collège Français]] in Berlin, where he was taught and greatly influenced by [[Johann Heinrich Samuel Formey]]. He went on to study philosophy at [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]], and later in [[Paris]]. On his return to Berlin he was received as a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in 1755.

[[Frederick the Great]], out of esteem for Isaac de Beausobre, adopted Louis as his son, and supported him in his studies.

{{Gnosticism}}
'''Mandaeism''' or '''Mandaeanism''' ({{lang-ar|مندائية}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Mandāʼīyah}}'') is a [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] religion&lt;ref name="Mandaens"&gt;{{citation|last=Buckley|first=Jorunn Jacobsen|title=The Mandaeans: ancient texts and modern people|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195153859|url=http://mandaeannetwork.com/Mandaean/books/english/2The_Mandaeans_Ancient_Texts_and_Modern_People_American_Academy_of_Religion_Books_Jorunn_Jacobsen_Buckley.pdf?bcsi_scan_955b0cd764557e80=0&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=2The_Mandaeans_Ancient_Texts_and_Modern_People_American_Academy_of_Religion_Books_Jorunn_Jacobsen_Buckley.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} with a strongly [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] worldview. Its adherents, the [[Mandaeans]], revere [[Adam]], [[Cain and Abel|Abel]], [[Seth]], [[Enos (biblical figure)|Enos]], [[Noah]], [[Shem]], [[Aram, son of Shem|Aram]], and especially [[John the Baptist]]. The Mandaeans are [[Semitic people|Semites]] and speak a dialect of [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic]] known as [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]]. The name 'Mandaean' is said to come from the Aramaic ''manda'' meaning "knowledge", as does Greek ''gnosis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudolph|first1=Kurt|title=Mandaeism|date=1978|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004052529|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/?id=M1kWzSxecUQC&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=kurt%20rudolph%20mandaeism&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=In some texts, however, it is said that Anoš and Manda ḏHayyē appeared in Jerusalem together with Jesus Christ (Mšiha), and exposed him as a lying prophet. This tradition can be explained by an anti-Christian concept, which is also found in Mandaeism, but, according to several scholars, it contains scarcely any traditions of historical events. Because of the strong dualism in Mandaeism, between body and soul, great attention is paid to the "deliverance" of the soul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Light and the Dark: Dualism in ancient Iran, India, and China Petrus Franciscus Maria Fontaine - 1990 "Although it shows Jewish and Christian influences, Mandaeism was hostile to Judaism and Christianity. Mandaeans spoke an East-Aramaic language in which 'manda' means 'knowledge'; this already is sufficient proof of the connection of Mandaeism with the Gnosis...&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Middle East, but outside of their community, the Mandaeans are more commonly known as the ''{{transl|sem|Ṣubba}}'' (singular: {{transl|sem|Ṣubbī}}) or [[Sabians]]. The term ''{{transl|sem|Ṣubba}}'' is derived from the Aramaic root related to [[baptism]], the neo-Mandaic is ''{{transl|sem|Ṣabi}}.''&lt;ref name="Häberl1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Häberl|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam, the "Sabians" ({{lang-ar|الصابئون}} ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|al-Ṣābiʾūn}}'') are described several times in the [[Qur'an]] as [[People of the Book]], alongside Jews and Christians. Occasionally, Mandaeans are called "Christians of Saint John".&lt;ref name="Edmondo2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edmondo|first1=Lupieri|title=Friar of Ignatius of Jesus (Carlo Leonelli) and the First "Scholarly" Book on Mandaeaism (1652)|journal=ARAM Periodical|date=2004|volume=16 (Mandaeans and Manichaeans)|pages=25–46|issn=0959-4213}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to most scholars, Mandaeaism originated sometime in the first three centuries AD, in either southwestern Mesopotamia or the Syro-Palestinian area.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mandaeanism&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars take the view that Mandaeanism is older and dates from pre-Christian times.&lt;ref&gt;Etudes mithriaques 1978 p545 Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin "The conviction of the leading Mandaean scholars – E. S. Drower, Kurt Rudolph, Rudolph Macuch – that Mandaeanism had a pre-Christian origin rests largely upon the subjective evaluation of parallels between Mandaean texts and the Gospel of John."&lt;/ref&gt;  

The religion has been practised primarily around the lower [[Karun]], [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] and the rivers that surround the [[Shatt-al-Arab]] waterway, part of southern Iraq and [[Khuzestan Province]] in Iran. There are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide.&lt;ref name="yaledailynews"&gt;[http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20341 Iraqi minority group needs U.S. attention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025053439/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20341 |date=2007-10-25 }}, Kai Thaler, ''Yale Daily News'', March 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 2003 Iraq war, almost all of them lived in Iraq.&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/opinion/06deutsch.html "Save the Gnostics"] by Nathaniel Deutsch, October 6, 2007, ''New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; Many Mandaean Iraqis have since fled their country because of the turmoil created by the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and subsequent occupation by U.S. armed forces, and the related rise in sectarian violence by Muslim extremists.&lt;ref name="bbc0307"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6412453.stm Iraq's Mandaeans 'face extinction'], Angus Crawford, BBC, March 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, the population of Mandaeans in Iraq had fallen to approximately 5,000.&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH"/&gt;

The Mandaeans have remained separate and intensely private. Reports of them and of their religion have come primarily from outsiders: particularly from [[Julius Heinrich Petermann]], a scholar in Iranian studies,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} as well as from [[Nicolas Siouffi]], a Syrian Christian who was the French vice-consul in Mosul in 1887,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lupieri|first1=Edmundo|title=The Mandaeans: The Last Gnostics|date=2001|publisher=Wm.

==Etymology==
The term Mandaeism comes from Classical Mandaic ''Mandaiia'' and appears in Neo-Mandaic as ''Mandeyānā.'' On the basis of cognates in other Aramaic dialects, Semiticists such as Mark Lidzbarski and Rudolf Macuch have translated the term ''manda'', from which ''Mandaiia'' derives, as "knowledge" (cf. {{lang-arc|מַנְדַּע}} ''mandaʻ'' in Dan. 2:21, 4:31, 33, 5:12; cf. {{lang-he-n|מַדַּע}} ''maddaʻ'', with characteristic assimilation of /n/ to the following consonant, medial -nd- hence becoming -dd-&lt;ref&gt;Angel Sáenz-Badillos, ''A History of the Hebrew Language.'' Cambridge University Press, 1993 ({{ISBN|978-0521556347}}), p. 36 ''et passim.'' (See also [[Biblical Hebrew phonology#Classification]]: "Hebrew also shares with the Canaanite languages ... assimilation of non-final /n/ to the following consonant.")&lt;/ref&gt;). This etymology suggests that the Mandaeans may well be the only sect surviving from [[Late Antiquity]] to identify themselves explicitly as [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]].

Other scholars{{Who|date=April 2010}} derive the term ''mandaiia'' from ''Mandā d-Heyyi'' ([[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] ''manda ḏ-hiia'' "Knowledge of Life," in reference to the chief divinity ''hiia rbia'' "the Great Life") or from the word ''(bi)mandi'',&lt;ref name="Mandaens"/&gt;{{rp|81}}&lt;ref name="Mandaens"/&gt;{{rp|167}} which is the cultic hut in which many Mandaean ceremonies are performed (such as the baptism, which is the central sacrament of Mandaean religious life). This last term is possibly to be derived from [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] ''m’nd'' ''mānd'' ("house").{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==History==
[[File:Mandaean Scroll of Abathur.jpg|thumb|right|An 18th century Scroll of Abathur in the [[Bodleian Library]], [[Oxford]]. ]]

According to the Mandaean text the [[Haran Gawaita]], the recorded history of the Mandaeans began when a group called the Nasoreans (the Mandaean priestly caste as opposed to the laity), left Palestine and migrated to Mesopotamia in the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mandaeanism &lt;/ref&gt; The reason given for this was their persecution by the community in Jerusalem in the course of which the city was destroyed as a punishment. The emigrants went first to [[Haran (biblical place)|Haran]] (probably [[Harran]] in modern day Turkey), and then the [[Media (region)|Median hills]] in [[Iran]], before finally settling in the southern provinces of Mesopotamia (modern day [[Iraq]]).&lt;ref&gt; http://www.mandaeanunion.com/history-english/item/170-brief-history-on-the-mandaeans &lt;/ref&gt; 

At the beginning of the [[Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia]], the leader of the Mandaeans, Anush son of Danqa appeared before [[Muslim]] authorities showing them a copy of the [[Ginza Rba|Ginza Rabba]], the Mandaean holy book, and proclaiming the chief Mandaean prophet to be [[John the Baptist]], who is also mentioned in the [[Quran]]. This identified Mandaeans with the [[Sabians]] who are mentioned in the [[Quran]] as being counted among the ''Ahl al-Kitāb'' ([[People of the Book]]). This provided Mandaeans a status as a legal minority religion within the Muslim Empire. The Mandaeans were henceforth associated with the [[Sabians]] and the Jewish Christian group the [[Elcesaites]], on account of the location of all three in Mesopotamia in the early centuries AD, and the similarities in their beliefs. The importance of baptism in the rituals of all three is particularly marked. Like the Mandaeans, the Sabians were also said to be [[gnostic]]s and descended from [[Noah]]. Mandaeans continue to be identified with Sabians up to the present day, but the exact relationship between the three groups however, remains unclear. 

Around 1290, a learned Dominican Catholic from Tuscany, [[Ricoldo da Montecroce]], or Ricoldo Pennini, was in Mesopotamia where he met the Mandaeans. He described them as follows:

{{quote|A very strange and singular people, in terms of their rituals, lives in the desert near Baghdad; they are called Sabaeans. Many of them came to me and begged me insistently to go and visit them. They are a very simple people and they claim to possess a secret law of God, which they preserve in beautiful books. Their writing is a sort of middle way between Syriac and Arabic. They detest Abraham because of circumcision and they venerate [[John the Baptist]] above all. They live only near a few rivers in the desert. They wash day and night so as not to be condemned by God…}}

Mandaeans were called "Christians of Saint John" by members of the [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] mission in Basra during the 16th century, based upon their preliminary reports.&lt;ref name="Edmondo2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edmondo|first1=Lupieri|title=Friar of Ignatius of Jesus (Carlo Leonelli) and the First "Scholarly" Book on Mandaeaism (1652)|journal=ARAM Periodical|date=2004|volume=16 (Mandaeans and Manichaeans)|pages=25–46|issn=0959-4213}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=October 2016}} Some Portuguese Jesuits had also met some "Saint John Christians" around the [[Strait of Hormuz]] in 1559, when the Portuguese fleet fought with the Ottoman Turkish army in [[Bahrain]]. These Mandaean seemed to be willing to obey the Catholic Church. They learned and used the seven Catholic sacraments and the related ceremonies in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Mandaeans%20The%20True%20Descendents%20of%20Ancient%20Babylonians%20and%20Chaldeans.html |title=The Mandaeans: True descendents of ancient Babylonians |publisher=Nineveh.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Mandaeism, as the religion of the Mandaean people, is based more on a common heritage than on any set of religious creeds and doctrines. A basic guide to Mandaean theology does not exist. The corpus of Mandaean literature, though quite large, covers topics such as [[eschatology]], the knowledge of God and the afterlife—in an unsystematic manner. Moreover, it is known only to the priesthood and a few laypeople.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Segelberg]] "Maşbūtā. Studies in the Ritual of the Mandæan Baptism, Uppsala, Sweden, 1958."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2014}}

===Fundamental tenets===
According to E. S. Drower, the Mandaean Gnosis is characterized by nine features, which appear in various forms in other gnostic sects:&lt;ref name=Drower1960&gt;{{Cite book | last =Drower | first =Ethel Stephana | author-link =E. S. Drower | publication-date =1960 | title =The secret Adam, a study of Nasoraean gnosis | publication-place =London UK | publisher =Clarendon Press | page =xvi | nopp =true| url=http://holybooks.lichtenbergpress.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Secret-Adam-A-Study-of-Nasoraen-Gnosis.pdf | accessdate=19 February 2014 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A supreme formless Entity, the expression of which in time and space is creation of spiritual, etheric, and material worlds and beings. Production of these is delegated by It to a creator or creators who originated in It. The cosmos is created by Archetypal Man, who produces it in similitude to his own shape.
# [[Dualistic cosmology|Dualism]]: a cosmic Father and Mother, Light and Darkness, Right and Left, [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|syzygy]] in cosmic and microcosmic form.
# As a feature of this dualism, counter-types, a world of ideas.
# The soul is portrayed as an exile, a captive; its home and origin are the supreme Entity, to which the soul eventually returns.
# Planets and stars influence fate and human beings, and are also places of detention after death.
# A saviour spirit or saviour spirits which assist the soul on the journey through life and after it to 'worlds of light.'
# A cult-language of symbol and metaphor. Ideas and qualities are personified.
# 'Mysteries', i.e. [[sacrament]]s to aid and purify the soul, to ensure [[reincarnation|rebirth]] into a spiritual body, and ascent from the world of matter. These are often adaptations of existing seasonal and traditional rites to which an esoteric interpretation is attached. In the case of the Naṣoreans this interpretation is based upon the Creation story (see 1 and 2), especially on the Divine Man, Adam, as crowned and anointed King-priest.
# Great secrecy is enjoined upon initiates; full explanation of 1, 2, and 8 being reserved for those considered able to understand and preserve the gnosis.

===Cosmology===
[[File:Abatur.jpg|thumb|231px|right|Image of [[Abatur]] from [[Diwan Abatur]]]]
As noted above Mandaean theology is not systematic. There is no one single authoritative account of the creation of the cosmos, but rather a series of several accounts. Some scholars, such as Edmondo Lupieri,&lt;ref name="cosmology"&gt;Lupieri (2002), pp. 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt; maintain that comparison of these different accounts may reveal the diverse religious influences upon which the Mandaeans have drawn and the ways in which the Mandaean religion has evolved over time.

In contrast with the religious texts of the western Gnostic sects formerly found in Syria and Egypt, the earliest Mandaean religious texts suggest a more strictly dualistic theology, typical of other Iranian religions such as [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Zurvanism]], [[Manichaeism]], and the teachings of [[Mazdak]]. In these texts, instead of a large [[pleroma]], there is a discrete division between ''light'' and ''darkness.'' The ruler of darkness is called [[Ptahil (deity)|Ptahil]] (similar to the [[Demiurge#Gnosticism|Gnostic Demiurge]]), and the originator of the light (i.e. God) is only known as "the great first Life from the worlds of light, the sublime one that stands above all works." When this being [[emanationism|emanated]], other spiritual beings became increasingly corrupted, and they and their ruler Ptahil created our world. The name Ptahil is suggestive of the Egyptian [[Ptah]]—the Mandaeans believe that they were resident in Egypt for a while—joined to the semitic [[El (deity)|El]], meaning "god".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The issue is further complicated by the fact that Ptahil alone does not constitute the demiurge but only fills that role insofar as he is the creator of our world. Rather, Ptahil is the lowest of a group of three "demiurgic" beings, the other two being Yushamin (a.k.a. Joshamin) and Abathur. Abathur's demiurgic role consists of his sitting in judgment upon the souls of mortals. The role of Yushamin, the senior being, is more obscure; wanting to create a world of his own, he was severely punished for opposing the King of Light. The name may derive from Iao ''haš-šammayim'' (in Hebrew: Yahweh "of the heavens").&lt;ref&gt;Lupieri (2002), pp. 39-40, n. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Mandaeans agree with other gnostic sects that the world is a prison governed by the planetary [[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]], they do not view it as a cruel and inhospitable one.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Chief prophets===
Mandaeans recognize several prophets. [[John the Baptist#Mandaeans|Yahya ibn Zakariyya]], known to [[Christian]]s as John the Baptist, is accorded a special status, higher than his role in Christianity and Islam. Mandaeans do not consider John to be the founder of their religion but revere him as one of their greatest teachers, tracing their beliefs back to [[Adam]].

Mandaeans maintain that [[Jesus]] was a ''mšiha kdaba'' "false messiah"&lt;ref&gt;Lupieri (2002), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; who perverted the teachings entrusted to him by John. The Mandaic word ''k(a)daba'', however, might be interpreted as being derived from either of two roots: the first root, meaning "to lie", is the one traditionally ascribed to Jesus; the second, meaning "to write", might provide a second meaning, that of "book"; hence some Mandaeans, motivated perhaps by an ecumenical spirit, maintain that Jesus was not a "lying Messiah" but a "book Messiah", the "book" in question presumably being the Christian Gospels. This seems to be a folk etymology without support in the Mandaean texts.&lt;ref name="Jesus"&gt;{{cite book | last = Macuch | first = Rudolf | year = 1965 | title = Handbook of Classical and Modern Mandaic | publisher = De Gruyter &amp; Co. | location = Berlin | pages = 61 fn. 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the Mandaeans believe that [[Abraham]] and [[Moses]] were [[false prophet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Lupieri (2002), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; but recognize other prophetic figures from the [[Abrahamic religions]], such as Adam and his grandson Anuš ([[Enos (biblical figure)|Enos]]), as well as Nuh ([[Noah]]), his son Sam ([[Shem]]) and his son Ram ([[Aram, son of Shem|Aram]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The latter three they consider to be their direct ancestors.

Mandaeans consider the [[Holy Spirit]] in the [[Talmud]] and [[Bible]], which is known in Mandaic as the [[Holy Spirit#In Abrahamic religions|''Ruha d-Qudsha'']], to be an evil being.

===Scriptures===
[[File:Abatur at the scales.jpg|thumb|256px|right|Image of [[Abatur]] at the scales from Diwan Abatur]]
The Mandaeans have a large corpus of religious scriptures, the most important of which is the ''[[Ginza Rba]]'' or Ginza, a collection of history, theology, and prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/MN41563ucmf_2 |title=Ginzā, der Schatz [microform] oder das grosse Buch der Mandäer : Ginzā : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2014}} The ''Ginza Rba'' is divided into two halves—the ''Genzā Smālā'' or "Left Ginza", and the ''Genzā Yeminā'' or "Right Ginza". By consulting the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophons]] in the Left Ginza, Jorunn J. Buckley has identified an uninterrupted chain of copyists to the late second or early third century.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The colophons attest to the existence of the Mandaeans or their predecessors during the late [[Parthian Empire]] at the very latest.

The oldest texts are lead amulets from about the third century AD, followed by magic bowls from about AD 600. The important religious manuscripts are not older than the sixteenth century, with most coming from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Yamauchi (1982). "The Mandaeans: Gnostic Survivors". ''Eerdmans' Handbook to the World's Religions'', Lion Publishing, Herts., England, page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Ginza'' continued to evolve under the rule of the [[Sasanian Empire]] and the Islamic [[caliphate]]s, few textual traditions can lay claim to such extensive continuity.

Another important text is the ''[[Haran Gawaita]]'' which tells the history of the Mandaeans. According to this text, a group of Nasoreans (Mandean priests) left [[Judea]] after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of Jerusalem in the first century CE]], and settled within the Parthian Empire. 

Other important books include the ''[[Qolusta]]'', the canonical prayerbook of the Mandaeans, which was translated by [[E. S. Drower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/library/ginzarba.htm |title=The Ginza Rba - Mandaean Scriptures | publisher=The Gnostic Society Library |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the chief works of Mandaean scripture, accessible to laymen and initiates alike, is the ''[[Mandaean Book of John]]'' ({{cite web |last1=Lidzbarski |first1=Mark |title=Das Johannesbuch der Mandäer |url=https://archive.org/details/dasjohannesbuchd01lidzuoft |publisher=Giessen : Töpelmann}}), which includes a dialogue between John and Jesus. In addition to the ''Ginza'', ''Qolusta'', and ''Draša'', there is the ''Dīvān'', which contains a description of the 'regions' the soul ascends through, and the ''[[Asfar Malwāshē]]'', the "Book of the Zodiacal Constellations". Finally, there are some pre-Muslim artifacts that contain Mandaean writings and inscriptions, such as some [[incantation bowl#In Judaism|Aramaic incantation bowls]].

The language in which the Mandaean religious literature was originally composed is known as Mandaic, and is a member of the Aramaic family of dialects. It is written in a cursive variant of the Parthian chancellory script. Many Mandaean lay people do not speak this language, though some members of the Mandaean community resident in Iran and Iraq continue to speak Neo-Mandaic, a modern version of this language.

==Worship==
[[File:Darfash - Mandaean cross.png|thumb|180px|right|"Mandaean cross" (darfash)]]
The two most important ceremonies in Mandaean worship are baptism (masbuta), and a mass for the dead or 'ascent of the soul ceremony' (masiqta).&lt;ref&gt; http://www.mandaeanunion.com/history-english/item/170-brief-history-on-the-mandaeans &lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other religions, baptism is not a one-off event but is performed every Sunday, the Mandaean holy day. Baptism usually involves full immersion in flowing water, and all rivers considered fit for baptism are called Yardana (after the River Jordan). After emerging from the water, the worshipper is anointed with holy oil and partakes of a communion of bread and water. The ascent of the soul ceremony can take various forms, but usually involves a ritual meal in memory of the dead. The ceremony is believed to help the souls of the departed on their journey through purgatory to the World of Light.

A ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|mandī}}'' ({{lang-ar|مندى|links=no}}) is a place of worship for followers of Mandaeism. A ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|mandī}}'' must be built beside a river in order to perform maṣbuta (or baptism) because water is an essential element in the Mandaeic faith. Modern ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|mandī}}''s sometimes have a bath inside a building instead.  Each mandi is adorned with a ''darfash'', which is a cross of olive wood half covered with a piece of white pure silk cloth. The cross bears no relation to the Christian cross. Instead the four arms of the cross symbolise the four corners of the universe, while the pure silk cloth represents the Light of God.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.rferl.org/a/1053864.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Mandaeans believe in marriage and procreation, and in the importance of leading an ethical and moral lifestyle in this world. They also place a high priority upon family life. Consequently, Mandaeans do not practice [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]] or [[asceticism]]. Mandaeans will, however, abstain from strong drink and [[red meat]].

==Organisation==
There is a strict division between Mandaean laity and the priests. According to E.S. Drower (''The Secret Adam'', p. ix):

{{quote|[T]hose amongst the community who possess secret knowledge are called ''Naṣuraiia''—Naṣoreans (or, if the emphatic ‹ṣ› is written as ‹z›, ''Nazorenes''). At the same time the ignorant or semi-ignorant laity are called 'Mandaeans', ''Mandaiia''—'gnostics.'  When a man becomes a priest he leaves 'Mandaeanism' and enters ''tarmiduta'', 'priesthood.'  Even then he has not attained to true enlightenment, for this, called 'Naṣiruta', is reserved for a very few. Those possessed of its secrets may call themselves Naṣoreans, and 'Naṣorean' today indicates not only one who observes strictly all rules of ritual purity, but one who understands the secret doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Segelberg]], "The Ordination of the Mandæan tarmida and its Relation to Jewish and Early Christian Ordination Rites," (Studia patristica 10, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are three grades of priesthood in Mandaeism: the ''tarmidia'' "disciples" (Neo-Mandaic ''tarmidānā''), the ''ganzibria'' "treasurers" (from Old Persian ''ganza-bara'' "id.," Neo-Mandaic ''ganzeḇrānā'') and the ''rišamma'' "leader of the people". This last office, the highest level of the Mandaean priesthood, has lain vacant for many years. At the moment, the highest office currently occupied is that of the ''ganzeḇrā'', a title which appears first in a religious context in the Aramaic ritual texts from [[Persepolis]] (c. 3rd century BCE) and which may be related to the ''kamnaskires'' (Elamite &lt;qa-ap-nu-iš-ki-ra&gt; ''kapnuskir'' "treasurer"), title of the rulers of [[Elymais]] (modern [[Khuzestan]]) during the Hellenistic age. Traditionally, any ''ganzeḇrā'' who baptizes seven or more ''ganzeḇrānā'' may qualify for the office of ''rišamma'', though the Mandaean community has yet to rally as a whole behind any single candidate.

The contemporary priesthood can trace its immediate origins to the first half of the 19th century. In 1831, an outbreak of cholera devastated the region and eliminated most if not all of the Mandaean religious authorities. Two of the surviving acolytes (''šgandia''), Yahia Bihram and Ram Zihrun, reestablished the priesthood on the basis of their own training and the texts that were available to them.

In 2009, there were two dozen Mandaean priests in the world, according to the Associated Press.&lt;ref name="saving"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Contrera|first1=Russell|title=Saving the people, killing the faith|url=http://www.hollandsentinel.com/x1558731033/Saving-the-people-killing-the-faith|website=Holland Sentinel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017044028/http://www.hollandsentinel.com/x1558731033/Saving-the-people-killing-the-faith|archivedate=October 17, 2015|date=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with other groups==
The Mandaeans have been identified with several groups, in particular the Sabians and the Elkasaites. Other groups such as the Nazerences and the Dositheans have also been identified with the Mandaeans. The exact relation of all these groups to one another is a difficult question. While it seems certain that a number of distinct groups are intended by these names, the nature of these sects and the connections between them are less than clear. At least according to the ''Fihrist'' (see below), these groups seem all to have emerged from or developed in parallel with the "Sabian" followers of ''El-Hasaih''; "Elkasaites" in particular may simply have been a blanket term for Mughtasila, Mandaeans, the original Sabians and even Manichaeans.

===Sabians===
{{Main|Sabians}}
The [[Quran]] makes several references to the [[Sabians]], who are frequently thought to be Mandaeans. Sabians are counted among the ''Ahl al-Kitāb'' ([[People of the Book]]), and several [[hadith]] feature them. Arab sources of early Qur'anic times (7th century) also make some references to Sabians.  Some scholars hold that the etymology of the root word 'Sabi'un' points to origins either in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or Mandaic word 'Sabian', and suggest that the Mandaean religion originated with Sabeans who came under the influence of early Hellenic Sabian missionaries, but preferred their own priesthood. The Sabians believed they "belong to the prophet Noah";&lt;ref name="Khalil ‘ibn Ahmad"&gt;Khalil ‘ibn Ahmad (d. 786–787), who was in Basra before his death, wrote: "The Sabians believe they belong to the prophet Noah, they read ''[[Zaboor]]'' (see also [[Book of Psalms]]), and their religion looks like Christianity." He also states that "they worship the angels".&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Mandaeans claim direct descent from Noah.

Early in the 9th century, a group of [[hermeticism | Hermeticists]] in the northern Mesopotamian city of [[Harran]] declared themselves Sabians when facing persecution; an Assyrian Christian writer{{who|date=November 2010}}{{When|date=November 2010}} said that the true 'Sabians' or Sabba lived in the marshes of lower Iraq. The Assyrian writer [[Theodore Bar Konai]] (in the [[Scholion]], 792) described a "sect" of "Sabians", who were located in southern [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Chwolsohn]], Die Sabier, 1856, I, 112; II, 543, cited by Salmon.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=April 2016}} 

[[Al-Biruni]] (writing at the beginning of the 11th century) said that the 'real Sabians' were "the remnants of the Jewish tribes who remained in [[Babylonia]] when the other tribes left it for [[Jerusalem]] in the days of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] and [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]]. These remaining tribes&amp;nbsp;... adopted a system mixed-up of [[Magi]]sm and [[Judaism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farvardyn.com/mandaean.php |title=Extracts from E. S. Drower, 'Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran{{'-}} |website=Farvardyn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204143916/http://www.farvardyn.com/mandaean.php |archive-date=2011-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elkesaites===
{{Main|Elkesaites}}
The Elkesaites were a Judeo-Christian baptismal sect which seem to have been related, and possibly ancestral, to the Mandaeans (see Sabians). The members of this sect, like the Mandaeans, wore white and performed baptisms. They dwelt in east Judea and [[Assyria]], whence the Mandaeans claim to have migrated to southern Mesopotamia, according to the ''Harran Gawaiṯā'' legend. In the ''Fihrist'' ("Book of Nations") of Arabic scholar [[Ibn al-Nadim|Al-Nadim]] (c. 987), the ''Mogtasilah'' (''Mughtasila'', "self-ablutionists") are counted among the followers of ''El-Hasaih'' or [[Elkesaite]]s. ''Mogtasilah'' may thus have been Al-Nadim's term for the Mandaeans, as the few details on rituals and habit are similar to Mandaeans ones. The Elkesaites seem to have prospered for a while, but ultimately splintered. They may have originated in a schism where they renounced the [[Torah]], while the mainstream Sampsaeans{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} held on to it (as Elchasai's followers did)—if so, this must have happened around the mid-late 1st millennium CE. However, it is not clear exactly which group he referred to, for by then the Elkesaite sects may have been at their most diverse. Some disappeared subsequently; for example, the Sampsaeans are not well attested in later sources. The ''[[Ginza Rba]]'', one of the chief holy scriptures of the Mandaeans, appears to originate around the time of Elchasai or somewhat thereafter.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Manichaeans===
{{Main|Manichaeism}}
According to the ''Fihrist'' of ibn al-Nadim, the Mesopotamian prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], the founder of [[Manichaeism]], was brought up within the [[Elcesaites|Elkesaite]] (''Elcesaite'' or ''Elchasaite'') sect, this being confirmed more recently by the [[Cologne Mani Codex]]. Unfortunately, none of the [[Mani (prophet)#Works|Manichaean scriptures]] has survived in its entirety, and it seems that the remaining fragments have not been compared to the ''Ginza Rba''.  Mani later left the Elkasaites to found his own religion. In a comparative analysis, Mandaean scholar Säve-Söderberg indicated that Mani's ''[[Psalms of Thomas]]'' were closely related to Mandaean texts.&lt;ref&gt;Torgny Säve-Söderberg, ''Studies in the Coptic Manichaean Psalm-book'', Uppsala, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; This would imply that Mani had access to Mandaean religious literature, or that both derived from the same source.

===4th-century Nazarenes===
The [[Haran Gawaita]] uses the name [[Nasoreans]] for the Mandaeans arriving from Jerusalem. Consequently, the Mandaeans have been connected with the 4th-century [[Nazarenes (sect)|Nazarenes]] described by [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Drower | first =Ethel Stephana | author-link =E. S.

That is questioned by some, but others accept the pre-Christian origin of this group.

===Dositheans===
They are connected with the [[Samaritan]] group the [[Dositheans]] by [[Theodore Bar Kōnī]] in his ''Scholion''.

==Number of adherents==
{{main|Mandaeans}}
[[File:Mandaean-Mandi-Nasiriya-Iraq.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|Mandaean house of worship in [[Nasiriyah|Nasiriyah, southern Iraq]] in 2016]]
Official numbers estimate that the current population of Mandaeans numbers between 60,000 and 70,000 people. Their proportion in their native lands has collapsed because of the Iraq War, with most of the community relocating to nearby Iran, Syria, and Jordan.

In 2011, [[Al Arabiya]] put the number of hidden and unaccounted for Iranian Mandaeans in Iran as high as 60,000.&lt;ref name=alarabiya0612&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahmed Al-Sheati |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/12/06/181123.html |title=Iran Mandaeans in exile following persecution |publisher=Al Arabiya News |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the Mandaeans tallied in official numbers, many have formed diaspora communities outside the Middle East, especially [[Australia]], where some 10,000&lt;ref&gt;http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-21/meet-the-mandaeans-sydneys-followers-of-john-the-baptist/8727720?pfmredir=sm&lt;/ref&gt; now reside, mainly around [[Sydney]], representing 15% of the total world Mandaean population. 

According to a 2009 article in ''[[The Holland Sentinel]]'', the Mandaean community in Iran has also been dwindling, numbering between 5,000 and at most 10,000 people.

Approximately 1,000 Iranian Mandaeans have emigrated to the United States since the US State Department in 2002 granted them protective refugee status, which was also later accorded to Iraqi Mandaeans in 2007.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

A community estimated at 2,500 members live in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], where they began settling in 2008. Most emigrated from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacQuarrie|first1=Brian|title=Embraced by Worcester, Iraq’s persecuted Mandaean refugees now seek ‘anchor’—their own temple|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/08/12/embraced-worcester-iraq-persecuted-mandaean-refugees-now-seek-anchor-their-own-temple/qSTOVM3qTRoD8zSiuIlLTO/story.html|accessdate=19 August 2016|work=The Boston Globe |date=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maoism''', known in [[China]] as '''Mao Zedong Thought''' ({{zh|s=毛泽东思想|p=Máo Zédōng sīxiǎng}}), is a [[communism|communist]] [[political theory]] derived from the teachings of the Chinese political leader [[Mao Zedong]], whose followers are known as Maoists. Developed from the 1950s until the [[Deng Xiaoping]] [[Chinese economic reform|reforms in the 1970s]], it  was widely applied as the guiding political and military ideology of the [[Communist Party of China]] and as theory guiding revolutionary movements around the world. A key difference between Maoism and other forms of [[Marxist-Leninism]] is that Mao said that peasants should be the bulwark of the revolutionary energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meisner|first=Maurice|date=Jan-Mar 1971|title=Leninism and Maoism: Some Populist Perspectives on Marxism-Leninism in China|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/651881|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=45|pages=2-36|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by the working class in China.

=== The modern Chinese intellectual tradition ===
The modern Chinese intellectual tradition of the turn of the twentieth century is defined by two central concepts: [[iconoclasm]] and [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. pp. 12–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iconoclastic revolution and anti-Confucianism ====
By the turn of the 20th century, a proportionately small yet socially significant cross-section of China's traditional elite (i.e. landlords and bureaucrats) found themselves increasingly skeptical of the efficacy and even the moral validity of [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; These skeptical iconoclasts formed a new segment of Chinese society, a modern intelligentsia whose arrival—or as historian of China [[Maurice Meisner]] would label it, their defection—heralded the beginning of the destruction of the gentry as a social class in China.&lt;ref&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall of the [[Qing dynasty|last imperial Chinese dynasty]] in 1911 marked the final failure of the Confucian moral order and it did much to make Confucianism synonymous with political and [[social conservatism]] in the minds of Chinese intellectuals. It was this association of conservatism and Confucianism which lent to the iconoclastic nature of Chinese intellectual thought during the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14"&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese iconoclasm was expressed most clearly and vociferously by [[Chen Duxiu]] during the [[New Culture Movement]] which occurred between 1915 and 1919.&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14"/&gt; Proposing the "total destruction of the traditions and values of the past", the New Culture Movement was spearheaded by the ''New Youth'', a periodical which was published by Chen Duxiu and was profoundly influential on the young [[Mao Zedong]], whose first published work appeared on the magazine's pages.&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14"/&gt;

==== Nationalism and the appeal of Marxism ====
Along with iconoclasm, radical anti-imperialism dominated the Chinese intellectual tradition and slowly evolved into a fierce nationalist fervor which influenced Mao's philosophy immensely and was crucial in adapting Marxism to the Chinese model.&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 44"&gt;Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Vital to understanding Chinese nationalist sentiments of the time is the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which was signed in 1919. The Treaty aroused a wave of bitter nationalist resentment in Chinese intellectuals as lands formerly ceded to Germany in [[Shandong]] were—without consultation with the Chinese—transferred to Japanese control rather than returned to Chinese sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17"&gt;Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative reaction culminated in the 4 May Incident which occurred on that day in 1919. The protest began with 3,000 students in Beijing displaying their anger at the announcement of the Versailles Treaty's concessions to Japan, yet rapidly took a violent turn as protesters began attacking the homes and offices of ministers who were seen as cooperating with, or in the direct pay of the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17"/&gt; The [[May Fourth Movement|4 May Incident and Movement]] which followed "catalyzed the political awakening of a society which had long seemed inert and dormant".&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17"/&gt;

Yet another international event would have a large impact not only on Mao, but also on the Chinese intelligentsia: the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917. Although the revolution did elicit interest among Chinese intellectuals, socialist revolution in China was not considered a viable option until after the May 4 Incident.&lt;ref name=After&gt;Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, "[t]o become a Marxist was one way for a Chinese intellectual to reject both the traditions of the Chinese past and Western domination of the Chinese present".&lt;ref name=After/&gt;

=== The Yan'an period (November 1935–March 1947) ===
During the period immediately following the [[Long March]], Mao and the Communist Party of China (CPC) were headquartered in [[Yan'an]], which is a prefecture-level city in [[Shaanxi]] province. During this period, Mao clearly established himself as a Marxist theoretician and he produced the bulk of the works which would later be canonized into the "thought of Mao Zedong".&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45"&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The rudimentary philosophical base of Chinese Communist ideology is laid down in Mao's numerous dialectical treatises and it was conveyed to newly recruited party members. This period truly established ideological independence from Moscow for Mao and the CPC.&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45"/&gt;

Although the Yan'an period did answer some of the questions, both ideological and theoretical, which were raised by the Chinese Communist Revolution, it left many of the crucial questions unresolved; including how the Communist Party of China was supposed to launch a socialist revolution while completely separated from the urban sphere.&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45"/&gt;

=== Mao's intellectual Marxist development ===
Mao's Intellectual Marxist development can be divided into five major periods: (1) The Initial Marxist Period from 1920–1926; (2) the formative Maoist period from 1927–1935; (3) the mature Maoist period from 1935–1940; (4) the civil war period from 1940–1949; and (5) the post-1949 period, following the revolutionary victory.
# The Initial Marxist Period from 1920–1926: Marxist thinking employs imminent socioeconomic explanations and Mao's reasons were declarations of his enthusiasm. Mao did not believe that education alone would bring about the transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Communism#Marxist communism|communism]] because of three main reasons. (1) Psychologically: the capitalists would not repent and turn towards communism on their own; (2) the rulers must be overthrown by the people; (3) "the proletarians are discontented, and a demand for communism has arisen and had already become a fact".&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Donald M. The Function of "China" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; These reasons do not provide socioeconomic explanations, which usually form the core of Marxist ideology.
# The Formative Maoist Period from 1927–1935: in this period, Mao avoided all theoretical implications in his literature and employed a minimum of Marxist category thought. His writings in this period failed to elaborate what he meant by the "Marxist method of political and class analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Donald M. The Function of "China" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this period, Mao was concerned with the dichotomy between knowledge and action. He was more concerned with the dichotomy between revolutionary ideology and counter-revolutionary objective conditions. There was more correlation drawn between China and the Soviet model.
# The Mature Maoist Period from 1935–1940: intellectually, this was Mao's most fruitful time. The shift of orientation was apparent in his pamphlet ''Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War'' (December, 1936). "This pamphlet tried to provide a theoretical veneer for his concern with revolutionary practice".&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Donald M. The Function of "China" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao started to separate from the Soviet model since it was not automatically applicable to China. China's unique set of historical circumstances demanded a correspondingly unique application of Marxist theory, an application that would have to diverge from the Soviet approach.
# The Civil-War Period from 1940–1949: unlike the Mature period, this period was intellectually barren. Mao focused more on revolutionary practice and paid less attention to Marxist theory.  "He continued to emphasize theory as practice-oriented knowledge".&lt;ref name="Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117"&gt;Lowe, Donald M. The Function of "China" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest topic of theory he delved into was in connection with the [[Cheng Feng]] movement of 1942. It was here that Mao summarized the correlation between Marxist theory and Chinese practice; "The target is the Chinese revolution, the arrow is Marxism–Leninism. We Chinese communists seek this arrow for no other purpose than to hit the target of the Chinese revolution and the revolution of the east".&lt;ref name="Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117"/&gt; The only new emphasis was Mao's concern with two types of subjectivist deviation: (1) dogmatism, the excessive reliance upon abstract theory; (2) empiricism, excessive dependence on experience.
# The post-1949 period following the revolutionary victory: the victory of 1949 was to Mao a confirmation of theory and practice. "Optimism is the keynote to Mao's intellectual orientation in the post-1949 period".&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Donald M. The Function of "China" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao assertively revised theory to relate it to the new practice of socialist construction. These revisions are apparent in the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction''. "In the 1930s, when Mao talked about contradiction, he meant the contradiction between subjective thought and objective reality. In ''Dialectal Materialism'' of 1940, he saw idealism and materialism as two possible correlations between subjective thought and objective reality. In the 1940s, he introduced no new elements into his understanding of the subject-object contradiction. In the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction'', he saw contradiction as a universal principle underlying all processes of development, yet with each contradiction possessed of its own particularity".&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Donald M. The Function of "China" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar|expanded=variants}}

=== New Democracy ===
The theory of the [[New Democracy]] was known to the Chinese revolutionaries from the late 1940s. This thesis held that for the majority of the people of the planet, the long road to [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]] could only be opened by a "national, popular, democratic, anti-feudal and anti-imperialist revolution, run by the communists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amin|first=Samir|title=The Countries of the South Must Take Their Own Independent Initiatives|publisher=The Third World Forum|date=October 2009|url=http://www.forumtiersmonde.net/fren/index.php/activitesactions/249-the-countries-of-the-south-must-take-their-own-independent-initiatives|accessdate=22 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723131304/http://www.forumtiersmonde.net/fren/index.php/activitesactions/249-the-countries-of-the-south-must-take-their-own-independent-initiatives|archivedate=23 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People's war ===
Holding that "[[political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch05.htm|title=Quotations From Chairman Mao|publisher=Peking Foreign Languages Press|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maoism emphasizes the "revolutionary struggle of the vast majority of people against the exploiting classes and their state structures", which Mao termed a "[[people's war]]". Mobilizing large parts of rural populations to revolt against established institutions by engaging in [[guerrilla warfare]], Maoist Thought focuses on "surrounding the cities from the countryside".

Maoism views the industrial-rural divide as a major division exploited by capitalism, identifying capitalism as involving industrial urban [[Developed country|developed]] [[First World]] societies ruling over rural [[Developing country|developing]] [[Third World]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander C. Cook, "Third World Maoism" in A Critical Introduction to Mao. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University, 2011. p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Maoism identifies peasant insurgencies in particular national contexts were part of a context of world revolution, in which Maoism views the global countryside would overwhelm the global cities.&lt;ref name="Mao. Cambridge 2011. P. 289-290"&gt;Alexander C. Cook, "Third World Maoism" in A Critical Introduction to Mao. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA, Cambridge University Press, 2011, pp. 289–290.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this [[imperialism]] by the capitalist urban First World towards the rural Third World, Maoism has endorsed [[National liberation (Marxism)|national liberation]] movements in the Third World.&lt;ref name="Mao. Cambridge 2011. P. 289-290"/&gt;

=== Mass line ===
Contrary to the [[Leninism|Leninist]] [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] model employed by the [[Bolshevik]]s, the theory of the [[mass line]] holds that party must not be separate from the popular masses, either in policy or in revolutionary struggle. To conduct a successful revolution the needs and demands of the masses must be the most important issues.

=== Cultural Revolution ===
The theory of the [[Cultural Revolution]] states that the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat does not wipe out bourgeois ideology—the class-struggle continues and even intensifies during socialism, therefore a constant struggle against these ideologies and their social roots must be conducted. Cultural Revolution is directed also against traditionalism.

=== Contradiction ===
Mao drew from the writings of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] in elaborating his theory. Philosophically, his most important reflections emerge on the concept of "contradiction" (''maodun''). In two major essays, ''[[On Contradiction]]'' and ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'', he adopts the [[positivist]]-[[empiricist]] idea (shared by Engels) that contradiction is present in matter itself and thus also in the ideas of the brain. Matter always develops through a dialectical contradiction: "The interdependence of the contradictory aspects present in all things and the struggle between these aspects determine the life of things and push their development forward. There is nothing that does not contain contradiction; without contradiction nothing would exist".&lt;ref&gt;Mao Tse Tung, "On contradiction", Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, Foreign Language Press, Peking, 1967, p. 75, or http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, each contradiction (including [[class struggle]], the contradiction holding between relations of production and the concrete development of forces of production) expresses itself in a series of other contradictions, some dominant, others not. "There are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing, and one of them is necessarily the principal contradiction whose existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of the other contradictions".&lt;ref&gt;Mao Tse-Tung, "On contradiction", Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op. cit., p. 89, or http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the principal contradiction should be tackled with priority when trying to make the basic contradiction "solidify". Mao elaborates further on this theme in the essay ''[[On Practice]]'', "on the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing". Here, ''Practice'' connects "contradiction" with "class struggle" in the following way: Inside a mode of production, there are three realms where practice functions: economic production, scientific experimentation (which also takes place in economic production and should not be radically disconnected from the former) and finally class struggle. These may be considered the proper objects of economy, scientific knowledge and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Mao Tse-Tung, "On practice. On the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing", Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op.cit., p. 55: "Man's social practice is not confined to activity in production, but takes many forms&amp;mdash;class struggle, political life, scientific and artistic pursuits; in short, as a social being, man participates in all spheres of the practical life of society. Thus man, in varying degrees, comes to know the different relations between man and man, not only through his material life but also though his political and cultural life (both of which are intimately bound up with material life)", or http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_16.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

These three spheres deal with matter in its various forms, socially mediated. As a result, they are the only realms where knowledge may arise (since truth and knowledge only make sense in relation to matter, according to Marxist epistemology). Mao emphasizes&amp;mdash;like Marx in trying to confront the "bourgeois idealism" of his time&amp;mdash;that knowledge must be based on [[empirical evidence]].

Knowledge results from hypotheses verified in the contrast with a real object; this real object, despite being mediated by the subject's theoretical frame, retains its materiality and will offer resistance to those ideas that do not conform to its truth. Thus in each of these realms (economic, scientific and political practice), contradictions (principle and secondary) must be identified, explored and put to function to achieve the communist goal. This involves the need to know, "scientifically", how the masses produce (how they live, think and work), to obtain knowledge of how class struggle (the main contradiction that articulates a mode of production, in its various realms) expresses itself.

Mao held that contradictions were the most important feature of society and since society is dominated by a wide range of contradictions, this calls for a wide range of varying strategies. Revolution is necessary to fully resolve antagonistic contradictions such as those between labour and capital. Contradictions arising within the revolutionary movement call for ideological correction to prevent them from becoming antagonistic.

=== Three Worlds Theory ===
[[Three Worlds Theory]] states that during the [[Cold War]] two imperialist states formed the "first world"—the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The second world consisted of the other imperialist states in their spheres of influence. The third world consisted of the non-imperialist countries. Both the first and the second world exploit the third world, but the first world is the most aggressive party. The workers in the first and second world are "bought up" by imperialism, preventing socialist revolution. On the other hand, the people of the third world have not even a short-sighted interest in the prevailing circumstances, hence revolution is most likely to appear in third world countries, which again will weaken imperialism opening up for revolutions in other countries too.&lt;ref name="emg"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#maoism Maoism] Glossary of Terms, Encyclopedia of Marxism&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agrarian socialism ===
Maoism departs from conventional European-inspired Marxism in that its focus is on the agrarian countryside, rather than the industrial urban forces—this is known as [[agrarian socialism]]. Notably, Maoist parties in Peru, Nepal and the Philippines have adopted equal stresses on urban and rural areas, depending on the country's focus of economic activity. Maoism broke with the [[state capitalist]]{{dubious|date=February 2018}} framework of the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], dismissing it as [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]], a pejorative term among communists referring to those who fight for capitalism in the name of socialism and who depart from [[Historical materialism|historical]] and [[dialectical materialism]].

Although Maoism is critical of urban industrial capitalist powers, it views urban [[industrialization]] as a prerequisite to expand [[economic development]] and socialist reorganization to the countryside, with the goal being the achievement of rural industrialization that would abolish the distinction between town and countryside.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Badgley, John Wilson Lewis. Peasant Rebellion and Communist Revolution in Asia. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 1974. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maoism in China ==
In its post-revolutionary period, Mao Zedong Thought is defined in the CPC's Constitution as "[[Marxism–Leninism]] applied in a Chinese context", synthesized by Mao and China's "[[Generations of Chinese leadership|first-generation leaders]]". It asserts that [[class struggle]] continues even if the [[proletariat]] has already overthrown the [[bourgeoisie]] and there are capitalist restorationist elements within the Communist Party itself. Maoism provided the CPC's first comprehensive theoretical guideline with regards to how to continue socialist revolution, the creation of a socialist society, socialist military construction and highlights various contradictions in society to be addressed by what is termed "socialist construction". While it continues to be lauded to be the major force that defeated "imperialism and feudalism" and created a "New China" by the Communist Party of China, the ideology survives only in name on the Communist Party's Constitution as [[Deng Xiaoping]] abolished most Maoist practices in 1978, advancing a guiding ideology called "[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|title=Xinhua: Constitution of the Communist Party of China|website=news.xinhuanet.com|accessdate=10 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017214011/http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|archivedate=17 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maoism after Mao ==
=== China ===
Shortly after Mao's death in 1976, [[Deng Xiaoping]] initiated [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market reforms]] in 1978, thereby beginning the radical change in Mao's ideology in the People's Republic of China (PRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|title=UC Berkeley Journalism -Faculty - Deng's Revolution|accessdate=22 August 2007|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104132630/http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|archivedate=4 January 2009|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mao Zedong Thought nominally remains the state ideology, Deng's admonition to "[[seek truth from facts]]" means that state policies are judged on their practical consequences and in many areas the role of [[ideology]] in determining policy has thus been considerably reduced. Deng also separated Mao from Maoism, making it clear that Mao was fallible and hence the truth of Maoism comes from observing social consequences rather than by using Mao's quotations as [[Holy Writ|holy writ]], as was done in Mao's lifetime.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Contemporary Maoists in China criticize the social inequalities created by the revisionist Communist Party. Some Maoists say that Deng's ''[[Reform and Opening]]'' economic policies that introduced market principles spelled the end of Maoism in China, although Deng himself asserted that his reforms were upholding Mao Zedong Thought in accelerating the output of the country's [[productive forces]].

In addition, the party constitution has been rewritten to give the socialist ideas of Deng prominence over those of Mao. One consequence of this is that groups outside China which describe themselves as Maoist generally regard China as having repudiated Maoism and restoring [[capitalism]] and there is a wide perception both inside and outside China that China has abandoned Maoism. However, while it is now permissible to question particular actions of Mao and talk about excesses taken in the name of Maoism, there is a prohibition in China on either publicly questioning the validity of Maoism or on questioning whether the current actions of the CPC are "Maoist".

Although Mao Zedong Thought is still listed as one of the [[four cardinal principles]] of the People's Republic of China, its historical role has been re-assessed. The Communist Party now says that Maoism was necessary to break China free from its feudal past, but it also says that the actions of Mao are seen to have led to excesses during the [[Cultural Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|official view]] is that China has now reached an economic and political stage, known as the [[primary stage of socialism]], in which China faces new and different problems completely unforeseen by Mao and as such the solutions that Mao advocated are no longer relevant to China's current conditions. The official proclamation of the new CPC stance came in June 1981, when the Sixth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee took place. The 35,000-word ''Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China'' reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;Chief responsibility for the grave 'Left' error of the 'cultural revolution,' an error comprehensive in magnitude and protracted in duration, does indeed lie with Comrade Mao Zedong... [and] far from making a correct analysis of many problems, he confused right and wrong and the people with the enemy... herein lies his tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-studies.com/china/the-four-modernizations,-1979-82.html|title=China the Four Modernizations, 1979-82|website=country-studies.com|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scholars outside China see this re-working of the definition of Maoism as providing an ideological justification for what they see as the restoration of the essentials of capitalism in China by Deng and his successors, who sought to "eradicate all ideological and physiological obstacles to economic reform".&lt;ref&gt;S. Zhao, "A State-Led Nationalism: The Patriotic Education Campaign in Post-Tiananmen China", Communist and Post-Communist Studies, 1998, 31(3): p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, this led to the [[Sino-Albanian split]] when Albanian leader [[Enver Hoxha]] denounced Deng as a revisionist and formed [[Hoxhaism]] as an anti-revisionist form of Marxism.

[[File:ForbiddenCity MaoZedongPortrait (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|[[Tiananmen]] with a portrait of Mao Zedong]]
Mao himself is officially regarded by the CPC as a "great revolutionary leader" for his role in fighting against the [[Japanese fascism|Japanese fascist invasion]] during the Second World War and creating the People's Republic of China, but Maoism as implemented between 1959 and 1976 is regarded by today's CPC as an economic and political disaster. In Deng's day, support of radical Maoism was regarded as a form of "left deviationism" and being based on a [[cult of personality]], although these "errors" are officially attributed to the [[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]] rather than being attributed to Mao himself.&lt;ref&gt;For a newest expression of the official judgment see 中国共产党历史第二卷下册，中共中央党史研究室著，中共党史出版社，第二八章对"文化大革命"十年的基本分析(History of China Communist Party, Vol. 2, Party History Research Centre (November 2010), Chap. 28 Analysis on Cultural Revolution).&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Maoists were arrested in the [[Hua Guofeng]] period after 1976. The prominent Maoists [[Zhang Chunqiao]] and [[Jiang Qing]] were sentenced to death with a two-year-reprieve while some others were sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for 15 years.

=== Internationally ===
After the death of Mao in 1976 and the resulting power-struggles in China that followed, the international Maoist movement was divided into three camps. One group, composed of various ideologically nonaligned groups, gave weak support to the new Chinese leadership under [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Another camp denounced the new leadership as traitors to the cause of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. The third camp sided with the Albanians in denouncing the [[Three Worlds Theory]] of the CPC (see [[Sino-Albanian split]]).

Though initially praising the [[Soviet Union]] prior to, during and shortly after the [[Cuban Revolution]], [[Che Guevara]] later came out in support of Maoism and advocated the adoption of the ideology throughout [[Latin America]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The pro-Albanian camp would start to function as an international group as well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Latham|first1=Judith|date=19 August 2010|title=Roma of the former Yugoslavia|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/009059999109037|journal=The Journal of Nationalism and Ethnicity (of [[Nationalities Papers]])|volume=27, 1999|issue=2|pages=205–226|doi=10.1080/009059999109037|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (led by [[Enver Hoxha]] and the [[Albanian Party of Labour|APL]]) and was also able to amalgamate many of the communist groups in [[Latin America]], including the [[Communist Party of Brazil]] and the [[Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Ecuador|Marxist-Leninist Communist Party]] in [[Ecuador]]. Later, Latin American Communists such as [[Peru]]'s [[Shining Path]] also embraced the tenets of Maoism.

The new Chinese leadership showed little interest in the various foreign groups supporting Mao's China. Many of the foreign parties that were [[fraternal party|fraternal parties]] aligned with the Chinese government before 1975 either disbanded, abandoned the new Chinese government entirely, or even renounced [[Marxism–Leninism]] and developed into non-communist, [[social democratic]] parties. What is today called the "international Maoist movement"  evolved out of the second camp—the parties that opposed Deng and said they upheld the true legacy of Mao.

== Maoism's international influence ==

From 1962 onwards, the challenge to the Soviet [[hegemony]] in the [[World Communist Movement|world communist movement]] made by the CPC resulted in various divisions in communist parties around the world. At an early stage,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} the [[Albanian Party of Labour]] sided with the CPC. So did many of the [[mainstream]] (non-splinter group) Communist parties in South-East Asia, like the [[Burmese Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Thailand]] and [[Communist Party of Indonesia]]. Some Asian parties, like the [[Workers Party of Vietnam]] and the [[Workers Party of Korea]] attempted to take a middle-ground position.

The [[Khmer Rouge]] of [[Cambodia]] is said to have been a replica of the Maoist regime. According to the [[BBC]], the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] (CPK) in Cambodia, better known as the Khmer Rouge, identified strongly with Maoism and it is generally labeled a Maoist movement today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8373556.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Khmer Rouge Duch trial nears end|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_459313.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129075250/http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_459313.html|date=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maoists (and Marxists generally) contend that the CPK strongly deviated from Marxist doctrine and the few references to Maoist China in CPK propaganda were critical of the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aworldtowin.org/back_issues/1999-25/PolPot_eng25.htm|title=What Went Wrong with the Pol Pot Regime|website=aworldtowin.org|accessdate=10 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810043740/http://www.aworldtowin.org/back_issues/1999-25/PolPot_eng25.htm|archivedate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the west and south, a plethora of parties and organizations were formed that upheld links to the CPC. Often they took names such as Communist Party (Marxist–Leninist) or Revolutionary Communist Party to distinguish themselves from the traditional pro-Soviet communist parties. The pro-CPC movements were in many cases based among the wave of student radicalism that engulfed the world in the 1960s and 1970s.

Only one [[Western world|Western]] classic communist party sided with the CPC, the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]]. Under the leadership of the CPC and Mao Zedong, a parallel international communist movement emerged to rival that of the [[Soviets]], although it was never as formalized and homogeneous as the pro-Soviet tendency.

=== Afghanistan ===
The [[Progressive Youth Organization]] was a Maoist organization in [[Afghanistan]]. It was founded in 1965 with [[Akram Yari]] as its first leader, advocating the overthrow of the then-current order by means of [[people's war]].

=== Bangladesh ===
[[Purba Banglar Sarbahara Party]] is a Maoist party in Bangladesh. It was founded in 1968 with [[Siraj Sikder]] as its first leader. The party played a role in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].

=== Belgium ===
The [[Sino-Soviet split]] had an important influence on communism in [[Belgium]]. The pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Belgium]] experienced a split of a Maoist wing under [[Jacques Grippa]]. The latter was a lower-ranking CPB member before the split, but Grippa rose in prominence as he formed a worthy internal Maoist opponent to the CPB leadership. His followers where sometimes referred to as "Grippisten/Grippistes". When it became clear that the differences between the pro-Moscow leadership and the pro-Beijing wing were too great, Grippa and his entourage decided to split from the CPB and formed the [[Communist Party of Belgium – Marxist–Leninist]] (PCBML). The PCBML had some influence, mostly in the heavily industrialized [[Borinage]] region of [[Wallonia]], but never managed to gather more support than the CPB. The latter held most of its leadership and base within the pro-Soviet camp. However, the PCBML was the first European Maoist party that was officially recognized as a sister-party of the CPC by Beijing.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Though the PCBML never really gained a foothold in [[Flanders]], there was a reasonably successful Maoist movement in this region. Out of the student unions that formed in the wake of the May 1968 protests, Alle Macht Aan De Arbeiders (AMADA) or All Power To The Workers, was formed as a vanguard party-under-construction. This Maoist group originated mostly out of students from the universities of [[Leuven]] and [[Ghent]], but did manage to gain some influence among the striking miners during the shut-downs of the Belgian stonecoal mines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This group became the [[Workers' Party of Belgium]] (WPB) in 1979 and still exists today, although its power base has shifted somewhat from Flanders towards Wallonia. The WPB stayed loyal to the teachings of Mao for a long time, but after a general congress held in 2008 the party formally broke with its Maoist/Stalinist past.&lt;ref&gt;D., VAN HERREWEGEN, De verdeeldheid van radicaal-links in Vlaanderen: De strategische -en praktische breuklijnen tussen AMADA, de KPB en de RAL tussen 1969-1972, Unpublished masterpaper, Department of History, 25–29. http://www.ethesis.net/radicaal-links/radicaal-links.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecuador ===
The [[Communist Party of Ecuador – Red Sun]], also known as ''Puka Inti'', is a small Maoist [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] organization in [[Ecuador]].

=== India ===
[[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]] is the leading Maoist organisation in India. Two major political groupings owing allegiance to Mao Tse Tung's ideas — Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) People's War and Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI) — merged on on 21 September 2004 to form Communist Party of India (Maoist).

=== Iran ===
{{main|1982 Amol uprising}}
[[Union of Iranian Communists (Sarbedaran)]] was an [[Iran]] Maoist organization. UIC (S) was formed in 1976 after the alliance of a number of Maoist groups carrying out military actions within Iran. In 1982, the UIC (S) mobilized forces in forests around [[Amol]] and launched an insurgency against the Islamist Government. The uprising was eventually a failure and many UIC (S) leaders were shot.

=== Palestine ===
The [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] is a Maoist political and military organization. The DFLP's original political orientation was based on the view that Palestinian national goals could be achieved only through revolution of the masses and [[people's war]].

=== Portugal ===
[[File:Flag of Forças Populares 25 de Abril.svg|thumb|left|The flag of [[Forças Populares 25 de Abril|FP-25]]]]

Maoist movements in Portugal were very active during the 1970s, especially during the [[Carnation Revolution]] that led to the fall of the fascist government the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] in 1974.

The largest Maoist movement in Portugal was the [[Portuguese Workers' Communist Party]]. The party was among the most active resistance movements before the [[Carnation Revolution|Portuguese democratic revolution of 1974]], especially among students of Lisbon. After the revolution, the MRPP achieved fame for its large and highly artistic mural paintings.

Intensely active during 1974 and 1975, during that time the party had members that later came to be very important in national politics. For example, a future Prime Minister of Portugal, [[José Manuel Durão Barroso]] was active within Maoist movements in Portugal and identified as a Maoist. In the 1980s, the [[Forças Populares 25 de Abril]] was another far-left Maoist armed organization operating in Portugal between 1980 and 1987 with the goal of creating socialism in post-[[Carnation Revolution]] Portugal.

=== United States ===
In the United States during the late 1960s, parts of the emerging [[New Left]] rejected the Marxism espoused by the Soviet Union and instead adopted pro-Chinese communism.

The [[Black Panther Party]], especially under the leadership of [[Huey Newton]], was influenced by Mao Zedong's ideas. Into the 1970s, Maoists in the United States, e.g. Maoist representative Jon Lux, formed a large part of the [[New Communist movement]].

The [[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA]] is also a Maoist movement.

=== Spain ===
The [[Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted)]] was a [[Spain|Spanish]] clandestine Maoist party. The armed wing of the party was [[First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups]].

=== Turkey ===
{{see also|Maoist insurgency in Turkey}}
[[Communist Party of Turkey/Marxist–Leninist]] (TKP/ML) is a Maoist organization in [[Turkey]] currently waging a [[people's war]] against the [[Cabinet of Turkey|Turkish government]]. It was founded in 1972 with [[İbrahim Kaypakkaya]] as its first leader. The armed wing of the party is named the Workers' and Peasants' Liberation Army in Turkey (TIKKO).

=== Maoist organizations ===
Various efforts have sought to regroup the international communist movement under Maoism since the time of Mao's death in 1976.

Another effort at regrouping the international communist movement is the [[International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organizations (International Newsletter)|International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations]] (ICMLPO). Three notable parties that participate in the ICMLPO are the [[Marxist–Leninist Party of Germany]] (MLPD), the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) and [[Marxist–Leninist Communist Organization – Proletarian Way]]. The ICMLPO seeks to unity around Marxism-Leninism, not Maoism. However, some of the parties and organizations within the ICMLPO identify as Mao Zedong Thought or Maoist.

== Criticisms and interpretations ==
Maoism has fallen out of favour within the Communist Party of China, beginning with Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 1978. Deng believed that Maoism showed the dangers of "ultra-leftism", manifested in the harm perpetrated by the various mass movements that characterized the Maoist era. In Chinese communism, the term "left" can be taken as a euphemism for Maoist policies. However, Deng stated that the revolutionary side of Maoism should be considered separate from the governance side, leading to his famous epithet that Mao was "70% right, 30% wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ips-journal.eu/in-focus/the-politics-of-memory/article/show/70-per-cent-good-30-per-cent-bad-2216/|title=70 per cent good, 30 per cent bad|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese scholars generally agree that Deng's interpretation of Maoism preserves the legitimacy of Communist rule in China, but at the same time criticizes Mao's brand of economic and political governance.

Critic Graham Young says that Maoists see [[Joseph Stalin]] as the last true socialist leader of the Soviet Union, but allows that the Maoist assessments of Stalin vary between the extremely positive and the more ambivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Young, ''On Socialist Development and the Two Roads'', The Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs, No. 8 (July 1982), pp. 75–84, {{doi|10.2307/2158927}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some political philosophers, such as Martin Cohen, have seen in Maoism an attempt to combine [[Confucianism]] and [[socialism]]—what one such called "a third way between communism and capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao, by Martin Cohen, p. 206, published 2001 by Pluto Press, London and Sterling VA {{ISBN|0-7453-1603-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enver Hoxha]] critiqued Maoism from a Marxist–Leninist perspective, arguing that New Democracy halts class struggle, the theory of the three worlds is "counter-revolutionary" and questioned Mao's guerilla warfare methods.

Some say Mao departed from Leninism not only in his near-total lack of interest in the urban working class, but also in his concept of the nature and role of the party. For Lenin, the party was sacrosanct because it was the incarnation of the "proletarian consciousness" and there was no question about who were the teachers and who were the pupils. On the other hand, for Mao this question would always be virtually impossible to answer.&lt;ref&gt;"Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of Maoist thought in China was arguably responsible for as many as 70 million deaths during peacetime,&lt;ref&gt;Jung Chang and Jon Halliday,'' Mao: The Untold Story'' (Jonathan Cape, 2005) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/autumn06/autumn06_10.pdf policy autumn 06_Edit5.indd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216200515/http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/autumn06/autumn06_10.pdf|date=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]] of 1957–1958&lt;ref&gt;Teiwes, Frederick C., and Warren Sun. 1999.

Sharpe. pp. 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Leap Forward]]. Some historians have argued that because of Mao's [[land reform]]s during the Great Leap Forward, which resulted in [[famine]]s, thirty million perished between 1958 and 1961. By the end of 1961, the birth rate was nearly cut in half because of malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar, Roderick. 1974. The origins of the Cultural Revolution. London: Published for Royal Institute of International Affairs, East Asian Institute of Columbia University and Research Institute on Communist Affairs of Columbia by Oxford University Press. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Active campaigns, including party purges and "reeducation" resulted in imprisonment and/or the execution of those deemed contrary to the implementation of Maoist ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/17/AR2007071701486.html|work=The Washington Post|first=Perry|last=Link|title=Legacy Of a Maoist Injustice|date=18 July 2007|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents of destruction of cultural heritage, religion and art remain controversial. Some Western scholars saw Maoism specifically engaged in a battle to dominate and subdue nature and was a catastrophe for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Shapiro, ''Mao's War Against Nature: Politics and the Environment in Revolutionary China'', 2001, Cambridge University Press, p. 306, {{ISBN|0521786800}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Populism ===
Mao also believed strongly in the concept of a unified people. These notions were what prompted him to investigate the peasant uprisings in Hunan while the rest of China's communists were in the cities and focused on the orthodox Marxist proletariat.&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 43"&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the pillars of Maoism such as the distrust of intellectuals and the abhorrence of occupational specialty are typical populist ideas.&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 44"/&gt; The concept of "People's War" which is so central to Maoist thought is directly populist in its origins. Mao believed that intellectuals and party cadres had to become first students of the masses to become teachers of the masses later. This concept was vital to the strategy of the "[[People's War]]".&lt;ref name="Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 44"/&gt;

=== Nationalism ===
Mao's nationalist impulses also played a crucially important role in the adaption of Marxism to the Chinese model and in the formation of Maoism.&lt;ref&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao truly believed that China was to play a crucial preliminary role in the socialist revolution internationally. This belief, or the fervor with which Mao held it, separated Mao from the other Chinese communists and led Mao onto the path of what Leon Trotsky called "Messianic Revolutionary Nationalism", which was central to his personal philosophy. German post–World War II [[Strasserism|Strasserist]] [[Michael Kühnen]], himself a former Maoist, once praised Maoism as being a Chinese form of national socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Martin A. ''The Beast Reawakens: Fascism's Resurgence from Hitler's Spymasters to Today'', 2013. p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15501">'''Mosiah priority''' is a theory about the creation of the [[Book of Mormon]] arguing that the original manuscript began not with [[1 Nephi]] (found at the beginning of the Book of Mormon), but midway through, starting with [[Book of Mosiah|Mosiah]]. According to Mosiah priority, after the text of Mosiah through the end of the Book of Mormon was transcribed, Joseph Smith returned to the beginning and transcribed 1 Nephi through [[Words of Mormon]]. Mosiah priority is the most widely held solution to questions regarding the sequence of the English text.

==Priority in the Book of Mormon==
The original transcription of the Book of Mormon by scribe Martin Harris was interrupted by the loss of the original manuscript.  The question about the subsequent workflow is known as the '''problem of priority in the Book of Mormon'''.

===Lost 116 pages===
{{see also|Lost 116 pages}}
The "Lost 116 pages" were the first manuscript pages of the Book of Mormon, and these were entrusted to scribe Martin Harris&lt;ref&gt;circa April–June 1828&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently lost.  Smith subsequently announced a revelation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Behold I say unto you, that you shall not translate again those words which have gone forth out of your hands; for behold, they shall not lie any more against those words; for behold, if you should bring forth the same words, they would say that you have lied; that you have pretended to translate, but that you have contradicted your words; and behold they would publish this, and satan would harden the hearts of the people, to stir them up to anger against you, that they might not believe my words&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/book-of-commandments-1833?dm=image-and-text&amp;zm=zoom-inner&amp;tm=expanded&amp;p=28&amp;s=undefined&amp;sm=none |title=Book of Commandments, 1833 |publisher=Josephsmithpapers.org |date=1904-02-20 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a preface to the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, Smith writes of the Lost 116 pages: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; I translated, by the gift and power of God, and caused to be written, one hundred and sixteen pages, the which I took from the Book of Lehi, which was an account abridged from the plates of Lehi, by the hand of Mormon; which said account, some person or persons have stolen and kept from me, notwithstanding my utmost exertions to recover it again -- and being commanded of the Lord that I should not translate the same over again, for Satan had put it into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering the words that they did read contrary from that which I translated and caused to be written; and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of this generation, that they might not receive this work: but behold the Lord said unto me, I will not suffer that Satan shall accomplish his evil design in this thing: therefore thou shalt translate from the plates of Nephi, until ye come to that which ye have translated, which ye have retained; and behold ye shall publish it as a record of Nephi; and thus I will confound those who have altered my words. I will not suffer that they shall destroy my work;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''1 Nephi'' priority===
Faced with the loss of the 116 page manuscript, transcription of a second manuscript began.

The theory of '''''1 Nephi'' Priority''' argues that after the loss of the original 116-page manuscript, the transcription process returned to the beginning of the Golden Plates narrative, starting over at the beginning with ''1 Nephi''.&lt;ref&gt;In order: 1 Nephi, 2 Nephi, Jacob, Enos, Jarom, Omni, Words of Mormon, Mosiah, Alma, Helaman, 3 Nephi, 4 Nephi, Mormon, Ether, Moroni, and finally the Title Page.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of 1 Nephi Priority included multiple 20th century authors.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan J. Barrett (1973, 86-88), Fawn M. Brodie (1971, 55, 57), Paul R. Cheesman (1973, 51-55), Richard O. Cowan (1984, 31), Francis W. Kirkham (1942, 222-25), and John J. Stewart (1966, 26-27).{{full citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{1 Nephi priority}}

==''Mosiah'' priority==
The theory of '''Mosiah Priority''' argues that after the loss of the original 116-page manuscript, transcription continued in narrative order, beginning with Mosiah and continuing to Moroni.&lt;ref name=Metcalfe1993&gt;{{citation |first= Brent Lee |last= Metcalfe |chapterurl= http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=10431 |chapter= The Priority of Mosiah: A Prelude to Book of Mormon Exegesis |title= New Approaches to the Book of Mormon |place= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[Signature Books]] |year= 1993 |pages= 395–444}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, the transcription process turned to replacing the beginning of the Book of Mormon (1 Nephi to Words), roughly corresponding to the material in the Lost 116 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Mosiah followed by Alma, Helaman, 3 Nephi, 4 Nephi, Mormon, Ether, Moroni, Title Page, 1 Nephi, 2 Nephi, Jacob, Enos, Jarom, Omni, and finally Words of Mormon&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Mosiah priority}}

===Historical evidence===

The title page of the Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith said was found at the very end of Moroni's record, had been completed before 11 Jun 1829.  But evidence shows that the translation process still continued after this date.&lt;ref name=Metcalfe1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=WelchRathbone&gt;{{cite report|author1=[[John W. Welch]] | author2=Tim Rathbone | title=Translation of the Book of Mormon: Basic Historical Information | id=WRR-86 | year=1986 | series=FARMS Preliminary Reports | publisher=[[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] | pages=33–37 | url=https://publications.mi.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=2839&amp;index=229 | accessdate=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Metcalfe also argues that because the title page mentions Mormon's abridgment and Ether, but not Nephi's record, this suggests that ''1 Nephi'' had not yet been translated.&lt;ref name=Metcalfe1993/&gt;

For some parts of the Book of Mormon text, likely dates of transcription have been identified.  This includes the restarting of translation work (referred to in D&amp;C 10 in April–May 1829), teachings on baptism in ''3 Nephi'' (referred to in D&amp;C 13 on May 15, 1829), and a prophecy of the [[Three Witnesses]] in ''2 Nephi'' 27 (referred to in D&amp;C 17 in June 1829).  The times when these passages were produced corresponds with a sequence and a consistent pace of translation beginning at ''Mosiah'' in April 1829&lt;ref&gt;After losing the first manuscript, the restarted translation work was actually initially begun in Summer 1828.  However, other demands in Joseph Smith's life hampered progress and little was produced until a revelation in April–May 1829 (found in LDS D&amp;C 10) recommitted Smith and his scribes to complete the work in haste.&lt;/ref&gt; and then arriving at ''1 Nephi'' later that summer.&lt;ref name=WelchRathbone/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Historical Introduction | department=Revelation, Spring 1829 &lt;nowiki&gt;[D&amp;C 10]&lt;/nowiki&gt; | work=The Joseph Smith Papers | publisher=[[Church Historian's Press]] | date=September 1, 2016 | url=http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-spring-1829-dc-10/1#historical-intro | accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pages of the original manuscript containing ''1 Nephi'' are written in [[Oliver Cowdery]]'s handwriting.&lt;ref name=Metcalfe1993/&gt;  However, the first scribes were Joseph's wife [[Emma Smith|Emma]] and his younger brother [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel]], suggesting that the original manuscript was not begun at ''1 Nephi''.&lt;ref name=Metcalfe1993/&gt;  In addition, a scribe's handwriting in ''1 Nephi'' is believed to be from [[John Whitmer]], who was not involved until late in the translation process, after Joseph Smith had moved back to [[Fayette, New York]].&lt;ref name=WelchRathbone/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSR&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Richard Bushman]] | title=Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling | publisher=Knopf | year=2005 | page=74, note 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jessee&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Dean C.

The beginning of the ''Book of Mosiah'' appears to be missing, since it lacks an introduction (unlike all the other abridged books) and its beginning was originally marked as Chapter 3 in the printer's manuscript.  This suggests that an earlier beginning to ''Mosiah'' may have been in the [[Lost 116 pages|lost 116-page manuscript]] and that the current ''Book of Mosiah'' immediately continues from that lost text.&lt;ref name=RSR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=R.

===Textual evidence===
Textual evidence for Mosiah priority includes the shift in word choices over the transcription process.  Scholars examine pairs of words that are roughly synonymous, such as:
* "therefore" and "wherefore." 
* "whoso" and "whosoever." 
* "inasmuch" and "insomuch."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Christopher C. |last= Smith |date= 2012-11-15 |url= http://www.withoutend.org/book-mormon-vocabulary-priority-mosiah/ |contribution= Book of Mormon Vocabulary and the Priority of Mosiah |title= Worlds Without End: A Mormon Studies Roundtable |work= Withoutend.org |type= group blog  |accessdate= 2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational studies===
A 2008 computational study claimed to note patterns which support Mosiah priority, although its methodology is not without criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1= Jockers |first1= Matthew L. |last2= Witten |first2= Daniela M. |last3= Criddle |first3= Craig S. |year= 2008 |title= Reassessing authorship of the Book of Mormon using delta and nearest shrunken centroid classification |journal= Literary and Linguistic Computing |volume= 23 |issue= 4 |pages= 465–491 |doi= 10.1093/llc/fqn040}}.

===Reception===
Mosiah priority is widely accepted by Book of Mormon researchers and in scholarly publications about the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Metcalfe|1993|pp=398–99}} lists proponents including Hyrum L. Andrus, Edward H. Ashment, [[Richard L. Bushman]], Edwin J. Firmage, Kenneth W. Godfrey, [[Dean C. Jessee]], Stan Larson, [[Dale L. Morgan]], Max J. Parkin, [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]], John A. Tvedtnes, [[Dan Vogel]], Wesley P. Walters, [[John W. Welch]], [[Robert John Woodford]], as well as the [[LDS Institute of Religion]] manual ''Church History in the Fullness of Times'' (1989).  Since Metcalfe's article, more publications have agreed with Mosiah priority, including:

'''Nikolai Alexandrovich Berdyaev''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ər|ˈ|d|j|ɑː|j|ɛ|f|,_|-|j|ɛ|v}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/berdyaev "Berdyaev"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|Никола́й Алекса́ндрович Бердя́ев}}; {{OldStyleDate|March 18|1874|March 6}}&amp;nbsp;– March 24, 1948) was a Russian political and also Christian religious [[philosophy|philosopher]] who emphasized the [[Existentialism|existential]] spiritual significance of [[Personalism|human freedom]] and the human person. Alternate historical spellings of his name in English include "Berdiaev" and "Berdiaeff", and of his given name as "Nicolas" and "Nicholas".

==Biography==
{{More footnotes|section|date=October 2017}}
Nikolai Berdyaev was born at [[Obukhiv]],&lt;ref&gt;Technically at the time "Obykhov" or "Obuchovo" {{cite book | last =Lowrie | title =Rebellious Prophet | page =14}}. https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Обухов_(город)] indicates "В Обухове родились: Николай Бердяев — русский религиозный и политический философ.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kiev Governorate]] in 1874, in an [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[military]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last       = Nicolaus | first      = Georg | authorlink =  | title         = C.G.

Almost all of Alexander Mikhailovich's ancestors served as high-ranking military officers, but he resigned from the army quite early and became active in the social life of the Kiev aristocracy. Nikolai's mother, Alina Sergeevna Berdyaeva, was half-French and came from the top levels of both French and Russian nobility. He also had [[Polish people|Polish]] as well as [[Tatar people|Tatar]] origins.&lt;ref&gt;George M. Young, ''The Russian Cosmists: The Esoteric Futurism of Nikolai Fedorov and His Followers'', Oxford University Press (2012), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Berger &amp; Alexei Miller, ''Nationalizing Empires'', Central European University Press (2015), p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

Greatly influenced by [[Voltaire]], his father was an educated man that considered himself a [[freethought|freethinker]] and expressed great skepticism towards religion. Nikolai's mother, [[Eastern Orthodox]] by birth, was in her views on religion more [[Catholicism|Catholic]] than Orthodox.  He spent a solitary childhood at home, where his father's library allowed him to read widely. He read [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] when he was only 14 and excelled at languages.

Berdyaev decided on an intellectual career and entered the [[Kiev University]] in 1894. It was a time of revolutionary fervor among the students and the [[intelligentsia]]. He became a [[Marxism|Marxist]] and he was arrested in a student demonstration and expelled from the university. His involvement in illegal activities led in 1897 to three years of internal [[exile]],  [[Vologda]],&lt;ref name = "Markovic"/&gt;{{rp|28}} in northern Russia, a mild sentence compared to that faced by many other revolutionaries.

In 1904, he married [[Lydia Berdyaev|Lydia Yudifovna Trusheff]]. The couple moved to [[Saint Petersburg]], the Russian capital, and the centre of intellectual and revolutionary activity. He participated fully in intellectual and spiritual debate, eventually departing from radical Marxism to focus his attention on philosophy and Christian spirituality.

A fiery 1913 article, entitled "Quenchers of the Spirit", criticising the [[Imiaslavie#Storming the monastery|rough purging]] of [[Imiaslavie]] Russian monks on [[Mount Athos]] by the [[Holy Synod]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] using tsarist troops, caused him to be charged with the crime of [[blasphemy]], the punishment for which was exile to [[Siberia]] for life. The [[World War I|World War]] and the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] prevented the matter coming to trial.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Self-Knowledge: An Essay in Autobiography'', by Nicolas Berdyaev (Author), Katharine Lampert (Translator), Boris Jakim (Foreword)  {{ISBN|1597312584}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, as the [[Bolshevik]] régime began consolidating its power with a growing suppression of non-Lenin Marxist Intelligentsia, Berdyaev remained steadfast in his criticism  of its [[totalitarianism]] and the domination of the state over the freedom of the individual. Nonetheless, he was permitted, for the time being, to continue to lecture and write.

His disaffection culminated, in 1919, with the foundation of his own private academy, the ''"Free Academy of Spiritual Culture"''. It was primarily a forum for him to lecture on the hot topics of the day and to present them from a Christian point of view. He also presented his opinions in public lectures, and every Tuesday, the academy hosted a meeting at his home because [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|official Soviet anti-religious activity was intense]] at the time and the official policy of the Bolshevik government, with its [[Soviet anti-religious legislation]], strongly promoted [[State atheism]].&lt;ref name = "Markovic"/&gt;

In 1920, Berdiaev became professor of philosophy at the [[University of Moscow]]. In the same year, he was accused of participating in a conspiracy against the government; he was arrested and jailed. The feared head of the [[Cheka]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], came in person to interrogate him,&lt;ref name="Gulag1"&gt;{{cite book | last       = Solzhenitsyn | first      = Aleksandr  | authorlink = Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn | title         = The Gulag Archipelago, 1918–1956: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, I–II | year = 1973 | publisher = [[Harper &amp; Row]] |  chapter   = Chapter 3 The Interrogation | ISBN = 0060803320}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|130}} and he gave his interrogator a solid dressingdown on the problems with Bolshevism.&lt;ref name = "Markovic"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Novelist [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] in his book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' recounts the incident as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Berdyaev] was arrested twice; he was taken in 1922 for a midnight interrogation with [[Felix Dzerzhinsky|Dzerjinsky]]; [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]] was also there.... But Berdyaev did not humiliate himself, he did not beg, he firmly professed the moral and religious principles by virtue of which he did not adhere to the party in power; and not only did they judge that there was no point in putting him on trial, but he was freed. Now there is a man who had a "point of view"!&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Markovic, op. cit., p.33, footnote 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Soviet authorities eventually expelled Berdyaev from Russia, in September 1922. He became one of a group of prominent writers, scholars and intellectuals who were [[forced exile|sent into forced exile]] on the so-called "[[philosophers' ship]]s".

At first, Berdyaev and other émigrés went to [[Berlin]], where he founded an academy of philosophy and religion, but economic and political conditions in the [[Weimar Republic]] caused him and his wife to move to [[Paris]] in 1923. He transferred his academy there, and taught, lectured and wrote, working for an exchange of ideas with the [[France|French]] and European intellectual community, and participated in a number of international conferences.&lt;ref&gt;Vide Berdyaev, "Dream and Reality", p. 264; also by-Berdyaev 1927 article | [http://www.berdyaev.com/berdiaev/berd_lib/1927_323.html A Conference in Austria]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[German occupation of France during World War II]], Berdyaev continued to write books that were published after the war, some of them after his death. In the years that he spent in France, Berdyaev wrote 15 books, including most of his most important works. He died at his writing desk in his home in [[Clamart]], near Paris, in 1948.

Primary source biographical works in English are Berdyaev's intellectual autobiography, published originally under the title ''Dream and Reality'', and Donald A. Lowrie's 1960 book, ''Rebellious Prophet: A Life of Nikolai Berdyaev'', written in close collaboration with Berdyaev's sister-in-law, Evgenia Rapp, and others of their close acquaintance under the auspices of the Berdiaev Société.&lt;ref&gt;Vide Lowrie, "Rebellious Prophet", Preface, p. ix-x&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
David Bonner Richardson described Berdyaev's philosophy as [[Christian existentialism]] and [[personalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-8870-8_3 Existentialism: A Personalist Philosophy of History], ''Berdyaev’s Philosophy of History. An Existentialist Theory of Social Creativity and Eschatology'', by David Bonner Richardson, pp 90-137&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized the importance of [[creativity]] that requires personal freedom.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

According to Marko Markovic, "He was an ardent man, rebellious to all authority, an independent and "negative" spirit. He could assert himself only in negation and could not hear any assertion without immediately negating it, to such an extent that he would even be able to contradict himself and to attack people who shared his own prior opinions".&lt;ref name = "Markovic"&gt;Marko Marković, ''La Philosophie de l'inégalité et les idées politiques de Nicolas Berdiaev'' (Paris: Nouvelles Editions Latines, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

He also published works about Russian history and the Russian national character. In particular, he wrote about [[Russian nationalism]]:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from book by [[Benedikt Sarnov]],''Our Soviet Newspeak: A Short Encyclopedia of Real Socialism.'', p. 446-447. Moscow: 2002, {{ISBN|5-85646-059-6}} (Наш советский новояз. Маленькая энциклопедия реального социализма.)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|The Russian people did not achieve their ancient dream of Moscow, the [[Third Rome]]. [[Raskol|The ecclesiastical schism of the seventeenth century]] revealed that the muscovite tsardom is not the third Rome. The messianic idea of the Russian people assumed either an apocalyptic form or a revolutionary; and then there occurred an amazing event in the destiny of the Russian people. Instead of the Third Rome in Russia, the [[Third International]] was achieved, and many of the features of the Third Rome pass over to the Third International. The Third International is also a [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Empire]], and it also is founded on an Orthodox faith. The Third International is not international, but a Russian national idea.}}

==Theology and relations with Russian Orthodox Church==
Berdyaev was a member of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]],{{sfn|Witte|Alexander|2007|p=111-112|quote="the doctrines and practice of the Russian Orthodox Church are in the background ... of all that he wrote.... Berdyaev was [always] a son of Orthodoxy."}}{{sfn|The Living Church|1948|p=8|quote="a devout member of Russian Orthodox Church"}} and believed Orthodoxy was the religious tradition closest to [[early Christianity]].{{sfn|Berdyaev|1952|quote="Orthodoxy is that form of Christianity which suffered the least distortion in its substance as a result of human history. ... Out of all forms of Christianity it is the Orthodox Church which remained more closely tied to early Christianity."}}

Berdyaev criticized Russian Orthodox Church and described his views as [[anticlerical]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;, but this should be considered in context of a abusive distortion of the "we" aspect of churchly [[Sobornost]] by a pseudo "us-them" class divisive Marxist-like mentality.{{failed verification|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Berdyaev |[http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/Philosophy/Sui-Generis/Berdyaev/essays/discord.htm Discord in the Church and Freedom of Conscience]&lt;/ref&gt;   He considered himself closer to Orthodoxy than either Catholicism or Protestantism. According to him, "I can not call myself a typical Orthodox of any kind; but Orthodoxy was near to me (and I hope I am nearer to Orthodoxy) than either Catholicism or Protestantism. I never severed my link with the Orthodox Church, although confessional self-satisfaction and exclusiveness are alien to me."{{sfn|Witte|Alexander|2007|p=111-112}}

Berdyaev is frequently presented as one of the important Russian Orthodox thinkers of the 20th century.{{sfn|Noble|2015}}{{sfn|Valliere|2006|p=2}}{{sfn|Clarke|1950}} However, [[Patristics|neopatristic]] scholars such as [[Georges Florovsky|Florovsky]] have questioned whether his philosophy is essentially Orthodox in character, and emphasize his western influences.{{sfn|Florovsky|1950}} But Florovsky can hardly{{cn|date=April 2018}} be considered an objective unbiased critic, having been savaged in a 1937 Journal Put' article by Berdyaev,&lt;ref&gt;Berdyaev |[http://www.berdyaev.com/berdiaev/berd_lib/1937_424.html Ortodoksia  and  Humanness (Archpriest  Georgii  Florovsky.  “The  Ways  of  Russian  Theology”, 1937, YMCA-PRESS.) Berdyaev.com&lt;/ref&gt; along with Florovsky's own extreme ultra-Byzantine views impelling his 1955 career change. Paul Valliere has pointed out the sociological factors and global trends which have shaped the Neopatristic movement, and questions their claim that Berdyaev and [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] are somehow less authentically Orthodox.{{sfn|Valliere|2006|p=3-4}}

Berdyaev affirmed [[universal reconciliation|universal salvation]], as did many important Orthodox theologians of the 20th century.{{sfn|Cunningham|Theokritoff|2008|p=118}} Along with [[Sergei Bulgakov]], he was instrumental in bringing renewed attention to the Orthodox doctrine of [[apokatastasis]], which had largely been neglected since it was expounded by [[Maximus the Confessor]] in the seventh century,{{sfn|Blowers|2008|p=37}} although he rejected [[Origen]]'s articulation of this doctrine.{{sfn|Deak|1977|p=20-60}}{{sfn|Kirwan|Hidden|2016|p=41-42}}

The aftermath of the Russian Revolution and Civil War, along with Soviet interference, caused the Russian Orthodox emigre diaspora to splinter into three Russian Church jurisdictions: the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] (in schism from Moscow Patriarchate until 2007); the parishes under Metropolitan [[Eulogius (Georgiyevsky)]] that went under the Constantinople [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]]; and parishes that remained under the [[Moscow Patriarchate]]. Berdyaev was among those that chose to remain under the omophor of the [[Moscow Patriarchate]]. He is mentioned by name on the Kosun/Chersonese Diocesan history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cerkov-ru.eu/istoriya-eparhii/|title=ИСТОРИЯ ЕПАРХИИ|website=Cerkov-ru.eu|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as among those noted figures who supported the Moscow Patriarchate West-European Eparchy (in France now Korsun eparchy).

Currently, the house in Clamart in which Berdyaev lived, now comprises a small "Berdiaev-museum" and attached Chapel in name of the Holy Spirit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cerkov-ru.eu/item/chasovnya-v-chest-svyatogo-duha-v-klamare|title=Часовня в честь Святого Духа в Кламаре|website=Cerkov-ru.eu|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the omophor of the Moscow Patriarchate. On 24 March 2018, the 70th anniversary of Berdyaev's death, the priest of the Chapel served panikhida-memorial prayer at the Diocesan cathedral for eternal memory of Berdyaev,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.egliserusse.eu/Il-y-a-70-ans-Nicolas-Berdiaev-1874-1948--celebre-philosophe-russe-etait-rappele-a-Dieu_a1661.html|title=Il y a 70 ans, Nicolas Berdiaev (1874-1948), célèbre philosophe russe, était rappelé à Dieu|first=Prêtre Georges|last=SHESHKO|website=Egliserusse.eu|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later that day the Diocesan bishop Nestor(Sirotenko) presided over prayer at the grave of Berdyaev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cerkov-ru.eu/novosti/ispolnilos-70-let-so-dnya-konchiny-izvestnogo-russkogo-filosofa-nikolaya-berdyaeva/|title=Исполнилось 70 лет со дня кончины известного русского философа Николая Бердяева|website=Cerkov-ru.eu|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nolle prosequi''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ɒ|l|i|_|ˈ|p|r|ɒ|s|ə|k|w|aɪ}};&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{OED|Nolle prosequi}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-la|ˈnolːe ˈproːsekwiː|classical}}) is a legal [[term of art]] and a [[List of Latin legal phrases|Latin legal phrase]] meaning "be unwilling to pursue",&lt;ref name="refdotcom"&gt;"[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Nolle+prosequi Nolle prosequi]". reference.com.

It is a phrase used in many [[common law]] [[criminal jurisdiction|criminal]] prosecution contexts to describe a [[prosecutor]]'s decision to voluntarily discontinue [[criminal law|criminal]] charges either before [[trial (law)|trial]] or before a [[verdict]] is rendered.&lt;ref&gt;A ''nolle prosequi'' can be entered at any time after the  indictment or information has been signed and before verdict:''R v Dunn [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/60.pdf &lt;nowiki&gt;[1843]&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{abbr|EngR|English Reports}} 60]; R v Colling (1847) 2 [[Cox's Criminal Cases|Cox CC]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tGk0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA184#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 184]; R v Sneesby (1951) [[State Reports Queensland|St R Qd]] 26; {{cite AustLII|SASC|1670|1989|litigants=R v Economou |paralleicte=(1989) 51 [[South Australian State Reports|SASR]] 421}}; {{cite AustLII|TASRp|16|1979|litigants=R v Heald |parallecite=[1979] [[Tasmanian Reports|Tas R]] 185}} source: {{cite AustLII|SASC|5679|1996|litigants=R v Michael Charles Baenisch |date=28 June 1996 |pinpoint=para. 12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It contrasts with an [[involuntary dismissal]].

== Application in law ==
''Nolle prosequi'' as a declaration is most often used in criminal cases, but in jurisdictions making use of ''nolle prosequi'' in civil lawsuits, it is used by a plaintiff that voluntarily drops its claims. In civil cases, a motion for [[voluntary dismissal]] may be made by a plaintiff instead of a declaration of ''nolle prosequi'', depending upon the custom and rules of a given jurisdiction.

=== Decision-maker ===
''Nolle prosequi'' as a declaration can be made by a prosecutor in a criminal case either before or during trial, resulting in the prosecutor declining to further pursue the case against the defendant. Courts seldom challenge applications for ''nolle prosequi''. In the [[United States]], judges will usually sign a dismissal order prepared by the prosecution or make a docket entry indicating the disposition of the case to be ''nolle prosse'' after a declaration or motion by the prosecution.

In criminal cases in the United States it has been held improper for a court to enter an order of ''nolle prosequi'' on its own, without a motion by the prosecutor,&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4202544690014107094&amp;hl=en United States v. Cox], 342 F.2d 167 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert denied, 381 U.S. 935 (1965). Involved a federal grand jury indictment against civil rights workers and the refusal by a US attorney to sign the indictment. The Fifth Circuit held that the US attorney's signing or withholding of his signature was within prosecutorial discretion and could not be coerced by the courts. See also the dicta in US v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 at 693, 1974, "[The] Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case." (citing Cox).&lt;/ref&gt; but as to sentencing discrepancies involved in a sentence recommendation, a trial judge is authorized to reject an underlying guilty plea based upon concerns of fairness and justice or because it is presented after the plea cutoff date.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4529448885415177681&amp;hl=en People v.

Rev. 741, Summer, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The notes to Rule 48 of the US [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] (FRCRP) draw attention to the effect of the rule as contrasting with common law. Rule 48 now mandates for prosecutors to seek leave of the court before they dismiss a case via filing a ''nolle prosequi''.&lt;ref name="frcpNote"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_48 FRCRP 48 notes], cornell.edu. Retrieved 2011-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reason ===
The declaration may be made because the charges cannot be proved because the evidence is too weak to carry the burden of proof, the evidence is fatally flawed in light of the claims that are brought,&lt;ref name="snead"&gt;Snead v. Jones, 169 Ala. 143, 53 So. 188; MacLaughlin v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., 93 N. J. L. 263, 108 Atl. 309; Dickerson v. Atlantic Refining Co., 201 N. C. 90, 159 S.E. 446; Hobbs v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 182 Iowa 316, 165 N.W. 912.&lt;/ref&gt; the prosecutor becomes doubtful that the accused is guilty, the defendant's innocence is proved, or the defendant has died. It has also been used when a federal criminal charge is brought up against a defendant when the prosecutor on a state charge for the same offense no longer wishes to pursue the case. Usually, that happens when the state prosecutor is content with the sentence on the federal charge and has no need to go any further with the original case.

=== Timing ===
In criminal cases, ''nolle prosequi'' declarations are made generally after an indictment as long as adjudication on the merits has not occurred or, in some jurisdictions, as long as a trial has not commenced. In civil cases, ''nolle prosequi'' declarations are made either before the trial begins or before a judgment on the merits is rendered, depending on the rules of the jurisdiction.

=== Legal effect ===
The entry of a ''nolle prosequi'' is not an acquittal. Since the principle of [[double jeopardy]] therefore does not apply, the defendant may later be indicted on the same charge again.&lt;ref name="klopfer"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4221560055012353994&amp;hl=en Klopfer v. North Carolina], 386 US 213 at 214, 87 S. Ct. 988, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1, Sup. Ct., 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swick"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17187521144565403858&amp;hl=en Swick v. Liautaud], 662 NE 2d 1238, 169 Ill. 2d 504, Ill Sup. Ct., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klopfer at 215 et seq..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wynne"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1665611583418567020&amp;hl=en Wynne v. Rosen], 464 NE 2d 1348, Mass Sup. J. Ct., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application in civil cases ===
In civil cases, a ''nolle prosequi'' or voluntary dismissal may be entered as to one of several counts or claims, or as to one of several defendants, or both. In any jurisdiction, whether a motion for voluntary dismissal or a declaration of ''nolle prosequi'' is used, federal and state rules of [[civil procedure]] generally govern when, how, and why claims may be voluntarily dismissed and apply different rules to different types of claims and to whether a court may give leave to dismiss a matter with or without [[prejudice (legal procedure)|prejudice]].&lt;ref name="frcp"&gt;See [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] Rule 41, for example.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similarity to a declination of prosecution ==
''Nolle prosequi'' is similar to a declination of prosecution, which is an agreement not to prosecute made before any charges are brought or suit has been filed. A declination of prosecution may be made by an attorney or may be made as an agreement between the aggrieved party and the claimant.

In contrast, ''nolle prosequi'' is usually made after a decision to prosecute has already been made. A declination of prosecution may be made for many reasons, such as weak evidence or a conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="greenblum"&gt;Greenblum, [http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/documents/greenblum.pdf What Happens to a Prosecution Deferred-Judicial Oversight of Corporate Deferred Prosecution Agreements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119054112/http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/documents/greenblum.pdf |date=19 January 2012 }}, 105 Colum.

{{Saivism}}
'''Pashupata Shaivism''' ('''{{IAST|Pāśupata}}''', {{lang-sa|पाशुपत}}) is the oldest of the major [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] Hindu schools.&lt;ref&gt;For the Pāśupatas as the oldest named Śaiva group, see: Flood (2003), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a debate about pioneership of this school and Goan school of Nakulish darshan believes that Nakulish was pioneer and Lakulish and Patanjalinath were his disciples while Gujrat school believes that Nakulish and Lakulish are one. Sarwdarshansangrah written by Madhavachary mentiones it as "Nakulish Darshan" not as "Lakulish Darshan" Both sub schools are still active in their own areas. The philosophy of the Pashupata sect was systematized by {{IAST|Lakulīśa}} also called Nakulīśa&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;) in the 2nd century A.D. The main texts of the school are ''{{IAST|Pāśupatasūtra}}'' with Kauṇḍinya's ''{{IAST|Pañcārthabhāṣya}}'', and ''{{IAST|Gaṇakārikā}}'' with Bhāsarvajña's ''{{IAST| Ratnaṭīkā}}''. Both texts were discovered only in the twentieth century. Prior to that, the major source of information on this sect was a chapter devoted to it in {{IAST|Vidyāraṇya}}'s ''{{IAST|Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha}}''.

==Date==
The date of foundation of the school is uncertain. However, the Pashupatas may have existed from the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;For dating as first century AD, with uncertainty, see: Michaels (2004), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gavin Flood dates them to around the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;For dating from probably second century AD, see: Flood (2003), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also referred to in the epic [[Mahabharata]] which is thought to have reached a final form by 4th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mahabharata#cite note-vanB73-9|Buitenen (1973) pp. xxiv–xxv]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Pashupata movement was influential in [[South India]] in the period between the 7th and 14th century, but it no longer exists.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;

==Overview==
{{Hindu philosophy}}
Pashupata Shaivism was a devotional ([[bhakti]]) and ascetic movement.&lt;ref name=gale&gt;Lorenzen, David N. ''Śaivism''. An Overview, [in]: Gale's Encyclopedia of Religion, vol. 12, 2005, {{ISBN|0-02-865981-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Pāśupata as an ascetic movement see: Michaels (2004), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Pashu in [[Pashupati]] refers to the effect (or created world), the word designates that which is dependent on something ulterior. Whereas, Pati means the cause (or principium), the word designates the Lord, who is the cause of the universe, the pati, or the ruler.&lt;ref name="cowell1"&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt; To free themselves from worldly fetters Pashupatas are instructed to do a '''pashupata vrata'''. Atharvasiras Upanishsad describes the pashupata vrata as that which consists of besmearing one's own body with ashes and at the same time muttering [[mantra]] — "Agni is ashes, Vayu is ashes, Sky is ashes, all this is ashes, the mind, these eyes are ashes."&lt;ref&gt;Indian History, V. K. Agnihottri, 2003. {{ISBN|81-7764-393-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haradattacharya, in [[Gaṇakārikā]], explains that a spiritual teacher is one who knows the eight [[pentads]] and the three functions. The eight pentads of Acquisition (result of expedience), Impurity (evil in soul), Expedient (means of purification), Locality (aids to increase knowledge), Perseverance (endurance in pentads), Purification (putting away impurities), Initiation and Powers are&lt;ref name="cowell1"/&gt; —

The three functions correspond to the means of earning daily food — mendicancy, living upon alms, and living upon what chance supplies.&lt;ref name="cowell1"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Pashupatas disapprove of the [[Vaishnava]] theology, known for its doctrine servitude of souls to the Supreme Being, on the grounds that dependence upon anything cannot be the means of cessation of pain and other desired ends. They recognize that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not be emancipated because they still depend upon something other than themselves. According to Pashupatas, spirits possess the attributes of the Supreme Deity when they become liberated from the 'germ of every pain'.&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In this system the cessation of pain is of two kinds, impersonal and personal. Impersonal consists of the absolute cessation of all pains, whereas the personal consists of development of visual and active powers like swiftness of thought, assuming forms at will etc. The Lord is held to be the possessor of infinite, visual, and active powers.&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Pañchārtha bhāshyadipikā divides the created world into the insentient and the sentient. The insentient is unconscious and thus dependent on the conscious. The insentient is further divided into effects and causes. The effects are of ten kinds, the earth, [[Classical element|four elements]] and their qualities, colour etc. . The causes are of thirteen kinds, the five organs of cognition, the five organs of action, the three internal organs, intellect, the ego principle and the cognising principle. These insentient causes are held responsible for the illusive identification of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Self]] with non-Self. The sentient spirit, which is subject to [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] is of two kinds, the appetent and nonappetent. The appetent is the spirit associated with an organism and sense organs, whereas the non-appetent is the spirit without them.&lt;ref name="Cowell7"&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Union in the Pashupata system is a conjunction of the soul with God through the intellect. It is achieved in two ways, action and cessation of action. Union through action consists of pious muttering, meditation etc. and union through cessation of action occurs through consciousness.&lt;ref name="Cowell7"/&gt;

==Rituals==
Rituals and [[spiritual practices]] were done to acquire [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] or puṇya. They were divided into primary and secondary rituals, where primary rituals were the direct means of acquiring merit. Primary rituals included acts of piety and various postures. The acts of piety were bathing thrice a day, lying upon sand and worship with oblations of laughter, song, dance, sacred muttering etc. Postures involved absurd actions such as, snoring or showing signs of being asleep while awake, limping, wooing or gestures of an inamorato on seeing a young and pretty woman, talking nonsensically etc. Secondary rituals involved bearing marks of purity after bathing.&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. 108-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
Lakulisa is credited with authorship of the ''Pancharthavidya'', in which devotees are instructed to "bathe thrice a day" and "lie on the dust or ashes". This "Pasupata Vow" is also described in the [[Atharvasiras Upanishad]].&lt;ref name="Indian History 2003"&gt;Indian History, A.K. Agnihotri, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pasupatas worshiped Lord Shiva as God Almighty. They would bathe their body three times a day in sand, lie in ashes, sing bhajans of Shiva.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bhushan, P. 50, ''Religious Beliefs and Practices of North India During the Early Mediaeval Period''&lt;/ref&gt;

Laughing was also an important Pasupata practice, as was physically shaking and meditation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[Klaus Klostermaier|Klostermaier]], P. 234, ''A Survey of Hinduism''&lt;/ref&gt;

They call the union ([[Moksha]]) with Shiva, "Rudrasajujya."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Muller-Ortega, P. 32, The Triadic Heart of Śiva: Kaula Tantricism of Abhinavagupta in the Non-Dual)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five major principles==
According to Govind Chandra Pande,&lt;ref&gt;P. 155 Foundations of Indian Culture by Govind Chandra Pande&lt;/ref&gt; there are given major principles which the Pasupata members adhere to: 
#creature ("Karya") 
#creator ("Karana") 
#esoteric worship ("Yoga") 
#ritual ("Vishi") 
#salvation ("dukhanta")

==Sects==
The Pasupatas are known to have had sects within the Pasupata sect. For example, the Lakulins are said to be a sub-sect. The Tripurantaka sect are also said to be the same. Their scripture is the Cintra prashasti.&lt;ref name="Majumdar, P. 292"&gt;Majumdar, P. 292&lt;/ref&gt; They were found in Gujarat up to the Chalukya era.&lt;ref name="Majumdar, P. 292"/&gt; The Lalikesa Sasana were another sect.&lt;ref&gt;Dajee, P. 221 Writings and Speeches of Dr. Bhau Daji&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that "Lakulisa" became the name of the Pasupata sects at least after the 11th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, P. 220, Gorakhnatha and the Kanphata Yogis&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakulin sect is also known by the names "Lakulasamaya", "Lakula", "Lanjana", "Laguda", "Langala", "Nakula", "Vakula."&lt;ref&gt; Dyczkowski, P, 21, The Canon of the Saivagama and the Kubjika Tantras of the Western Kaul Tradition&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pasupatism historically practiced==
Temples with the carvings of Lakulisa are found in western regions of India as that is where it originated although it is also found in the east as far as Orissa, south to Tamil Nadu and north to Kashmir.

===Western India===
The practice of course began in western India and so spread amongst areas of the west. many images of Lakula have been found in areas such as Rajasthan.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, P. 146, ''An Outline of the Religious Literature of India''&lt;/ref&gt; Fergusson assigned temples from Rajasthan down to Andhra as belonging to the Pasupatas.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, P. 146, ''An Outline of the Religious Literature of India''&lt;/ref&gt; The region around Mt. Abu was the principal place of Pasuapta activities.&lt;ref name="Majumdar, P. 294"&gt;Majumdar, P. 294&lt;/ref&gt; MadhyaPradesh too has a treasure of images of Lakula found from places like Mandsaur, Ujjain, etc.

Along with other forms of Shiva, there is a painting of Lakulisa in an Ellora cave of Maharashtra.&lt;ref name="Rānaḍe, P. 36 Ellora paintings"&gt;Rānaḍe, P. 36 ''Ellora paintings''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern India===
"The form of Saivism in Kashmir during the early period was of the Pasupata sect. According to a tradition recorded in the Mahabharata, the doctrine of Pasupata was first preached by Siva Srikantha. Siva Srikantha was regarded in the Valley to as the promulgator or Sivagama or Agamanta Saivism which included the system of the Pasupata."&lt;ref&gt;Bamzai, P. 202, ''Culture and Political History of Kashmir''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern India===
In Tamil Nadu, it is known to have existed in the modern-day district of Tiruvottiyur, and in Kashmir in Payar, where there are Lakulisa figures found.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravarti, P. 63, ''The Concept of Rudra-Siva Through the Ages''&lt;/ref&gt; In Tamil Nadu, it also existed in Tanjore and Nagapattnam.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, P. xi, Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography and Allied Subjects in Honour of Dr. U&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the findings of the Archaeological Survey of India, Bijjaladeva of the Chalukyan Empire of Southern India and parts of Northern India, donated a gift in the service to God. The gift was made after washing the feet of Divyasakti-Panditadeva, a Lakulin.

===Nepal===
As the ''Hinduism Today'' article reports: 
:"A seventh-century Chinese traveler, Hiuen Tsiang, wrote that 10,000 Pashupatas then occupied Varanasi. The Pashupata tradition spread to Nepal in the eighth century, where the now famous Pashupatinath Temple became a prime pilgrimage center and remains so to this day. At its medieval zenith, Pashupatism blanketed Western, Northwestern and Southeastern India, where it received royal patronage. In the fifteenth century, it retreated to its strongholds of Gujarat, Nepal and the Himalayan hills" (March 1994, "Pashupata Saivism") 
It is believed by some scholars that they may have been absorbed into other sects such as the Kanpatha Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, P. 18''Religious Sects of the Hindus''&lt;/ref&gt;

To King Ishttanga's rule (915-930 CE) is attributed the building of a Pasupata temple.&lt;ref&gt;(Hāṇḍā &amp; Handa, P. 34 ''History of Uttaranchal''&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a Nakuleshvara Temple complex in Kalighata, West Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;''University of Calcutta'', P. 23 By Calcutta Review&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
It has been theorized by a few scholars such as Dale Hoiberg and Indu Ramchandani state that the sect existed in Cambodia and Java, Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;P. 160 ''Students' Britannica India'' By Dale Hoiberg and Indu Ramchandani&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reference in scriptures==
The Pasupata beliefs are summarized in the ''Pasaputa Sutra''. This text was rediscovered in 1930 and is attributed to Lakulisa himself.&lt;ref&gt;Subramuniyaswami, P. 809, Dancing With Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism&lt;/ref&gt; Bhanmdarkar attributes the ''Atharva-Siras''to the Pasupatas.&lt;ref&gt;Pillai, P. 321, Indian Sociology Through Ghurye&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the text, their vow is recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, P. 220, Gorakhnatha and the Kanphata Yogis&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mahabharata]] claimed that he was a son of Lord [[Brahma]] and taught people the Pasupata system.&lt;ref&gt;Klostermaier, Klaus, P. 168, Mythologies and Philosophies of Salvation in the Theistic Traditions of India&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahabharata, Srikantha (or Lakulisa) claims that the Pasupata system is a son of Lord Brahma when a form of Shiva emerged from Lord Brahma's eyebrow (MBh (B), 12, 349-67) &lt;ref&gt;Stietencron, P. 108, Hindu Myth, Hindu History, Religion, Art, and Politics&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sarva-Darsana-Samgraha'' of the Advaitin saint Madhavacarya wrote in the text, the philosophical system of Lakulin. Kaundinya's or Rashikara's ''Pancharta Bhasya'' discusses this sect.&lt;ref&gt;Pande, P. 155, Foundations of Indian Culture&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gana-karika'' of Bhasarvajna too discusses this school in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Pande, P. 155, Foundations of Indian Culture&lt;/ref&gt; The Pasupata system is mentioned in the ''Vayuviha Samhita''.&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, P. 10 A History of Indian Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people including compilers of the [[Vayu Purana|Vayu]] and [[Linga Purana|Linga]] puranas to be a corresponding system of the Pancharatna.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, P. 293 Chaulukyas of Gujarat&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5464">'''Petrus Martinez de Osma''' ({{lang-es|Pedro Martínez de Osma}}) (died 1480) was a Spanish theologian and philosopher, known for his views on [[indulgence]]s, which he retracted at the end of his life.

==Life==
He graduated M.A. at the [[University of Salamanca]] in 1457. He was professor of theology there from 1463.&lt;ref name="Stegmüller1950"&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Stegmüller|title=Repertorium Biblicum Medii Aevi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDgRm1-1MW0C&amp;pg=PA340|accessdate=3 August 2012|year=1950|publisher=Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Instituto Francisco Suárez|isbn=978-84-00-06980-3|page=340|language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follower of [[Alonso Tostado|Alonso el Madrigal (el Tostado)]], from 1476 he defended theses on indulgences and [[Confession (religion)|confession]] resembling those of [[John Wyclif]] and [[Jan Hus]], and anticipating issues from the [[Protestant Reformation]].

His ideas were declared heretical, a judgement backed by a [[papal bull]] of [[Pope Sixtus IV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ana (ed.) Chaguaceda Toledano|title=Miguel de Unamuno.

'''Phenomenology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''phainómenon'' "that which appears" and ''lógos'' "study") is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] study of the structures of experience and [[consciousness]]. As a [[philosophical movement]] it was founded in the early years of the 20th century by [[Edmund Husserl]] and was later expanded upon by a circle of his followers at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]] in [[Germany]]. It then spread to [[France]], the [[United States]], and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work.&lt;ref name="Husserlhistory"&gt;{{citation

Phenomenology is not a unitary movement; rather, different authors share a common family resemblance but also with many significant differences. Gabriella Farina states:&lt;blockquote&gt;A unique and final definition of phenomenology is dangerous and perhaps even paradoxical as it lacks a thematic focus. In fact, it is not a doctrine, nor a philosophical school, but rather a style of thought, a method, an open and ever-renewed experience having different results, and this may disorient anyone wishing to define the meaning of phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014) Some reflections on the phenomenological method. Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences, 7(2):50-62.http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Phenomenology, in Husserl's conception, is primarily concerned with the systematic reflection on and study of the structures of consciousness and the [[phenomena]] that appear in acts of consciousness. Phenomenology can be clearly differentiated from the [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] method of analysis which sees the world as [[Entity|object]]s, sets of objects, and objects acting and reacting upon one another.

Husserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticized and developed not only by himself but also by students such as [[Edith Stein]] and [[Roman Ingarden]], by [[hermeneutics|hermeneutic philosophers]] such as [[Martin Heidegger]], by [[Existentialism|existentialists]] such as [[Nicolai Hartmann]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and by other philosophers such as [[Max Scheler]], [[Paul Ricoeur]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[Michel Henry]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and sociologists [[Alfred Schütz]] and [[Eric Voegelin]].

==Overview==

In its most basic form, phenomenology attempts to create conditions for the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] study of topics usually regarded as [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]]: consciousness and the content of conscious experiences such as [[judgment | judgement]]s, [[perceptions]], and [[emotions]]. Although phenomenology seeks to be scientific, it does not attempt to study consciousness from the perspective of clinical psychology or neurology. Instead, it seeks through systematic reflection to determine the essential properties and structures of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Menon|first1=Sangeetha|author2=Anindya Sinha|author3=B.V. Sreekantan|title=Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Consciousness and the Self|date=2014|publisher=Springer|location=New Youk, Dordrecht, London|isbn=978-81-322-1586-8|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Pg-7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=phenomenology+essential+properties+and+structures+of+experience#v=onepage&amp;q=phenomenology%20essential%20properties%20and%20structures%20of%20experience&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several assumptions behind phenomenology that help explain its foundations:
#Phenomenologists reject the concept of objective research. They prefer grouping assumptions through a process called phenomenological [[epoché]].
#They believe that analyzing daily human behavior can provide one with a greater understanding of nature.
#They assert that persons should be explored. This is because persons can be understood through the unique ways they reflect the society they live in.
#Phenomenologists prefer to gather "capta", or conscious experience, rather than traditional data.
#They consider phenomenology to be oriented toward discovery, and therefore they research using methods that are far less restrictive than in other sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, Mark P. (2009). Phenomenology. In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 750-752). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Husserl derived many important concepts central to phenomenology from the works and lectures of his teachers, the philosophers and psychologists [[Franz Brentano]] and [[Carl Stumpf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Robin|last=Rollinger|title=Husserl's Position in the School of Brentano|publisher=Kluwer|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important element of phenomenology that Husserl borrowed from Brentano is [[intentionality]] (often described as "aboutness"), the notion that consciousness is always consciousness ''of'' something. The object of consciousness is called the ''intentional object'', and this object is constituted for consciousness in many different ways, through, for instance, [[perception]], [[memory]], [[retention and protention]], [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]], etc. Throughout these different intentionalities, though they have different structures and different ways of being "about" the object, an object is still constituted as the identical object; consciousness is directed at the same intentional object in direct perception as it is in the immediately following retention of this object and the eventual remembering of it.

Though many of the phenomenological methods involve various reductions, phenomenology is, in essence, anti-[[reductionism|reductionistic]]; the reductions are mere tools to better understand and describe the workings of consciousness, not to reduce any phenomenon to these descriptions. In other words, when a reference is made to a thing's ''essence'' or ''idea'', or when the constitution of an identical coherent thing is specified by describing what one "really" sees as being only these sides and aspects, these surfaces, it does not mean that the thing is only and exclusively what is described here: the ultimate goal of these reductions is to understand ''how'' these different aspects are constituted into the actual thing as experienced by the person experiencing it. Phenomenology is a direct reaction to the [[psychologism]] and [[physicalism]] of Husserl's time.&lt;ref name="Husserl (Phenom. vs. Psych.)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Husserl|first1=Edmund|title=The Crisis of European Sciences, Part IIIB § 57. The fateful separation of transcendental philosophy and psychology.|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/husserl2.htm|website=Marxists.org|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although previously employed by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in his ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', it was Husserl's adoption of this term (circa 1900) that propelled it into becoming the designation of a philosophical school. As a philosophical perspective, phenomenology is its method, though the specific meaning of the term varies according to how it is conceived by a given philosopher. As envisioned by Husserl, phenomenology is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since [[Plato]] in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's "lived experience."&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. ''The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology.'' Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970, pg. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Loosely rooted in an epistemological device, with [[Sceptic]] roots, called [[epoché]], Husserl's method entails the suspension of judgment while relying on the intuitive grasp of knowledge, free of presuppositions and intellectualizing. Sometimes depicted as the "science of experience," the phenomenological method is rooted in intentionality, i.e. Husserl's theory of consciousness (developed from Brentano). Intentionality represents an alternative to the representational theory of consciousness, which holds that reality cannot be grasped directly because it is available only through perceptions of reality that are representations of it in the mind. Husserl countered that consciousness is not "in" the mind; rather, consciousness is conscious of something other than itself (the intentional object), whether the object is a substance or a figment of [[imagination]] (i.e., the real processes associated with and underlying the figment). Hence the phenomenological method relies on the [[phenomenological description|description of phenomena]] as they are given to consciousness, in their [[immediacy (philosophy)|immediacy]].

According to [[Maurice Natanson]] (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;63), "The radicality of the phenomenological method is both continuous and discontinuous with philosophy's general effort to subject experience to fundamental, critical scrutiny: to take nothing for granted and to show the warranty for what we claim to know." In practice, it entails an unusual combination of discipline and detachment to '''bracket''' theoretical explanations and second-hand information while determining one's "naive" experience of the matter. (To "bracket" in this sense means to provisionally suspend or set aside some idea as a way to facilitate the inquiry by focusing only on its most significant components.) The phenomenological method serves to momentarily erase the world of speculation by returning the subject to his or her primordial experience of the matter, whether the object of inquiry is a feeling, an idea, or a perception. According to Husserl the suspension of belief in what we ordinarily take for granted or infer by conjecture diminishes the power of what we customarily embrace as objective reality. According to [[Rüdiger Safranski]] (1998, 72), "[Husserl's and his followers'] great ambition was to disregard anything that had until then been thought or said about consciousness or the world [while] on the lookout for a new way of letting the things [they investigated] approach them, without covering them up with what they already knew."

[[Martin Heidegger]] modified Husserl's conception of phenomenology because of what Heidegger perceived as Husserl's subjectivist tendencies. Whereas Husserl conceived humans as having been constituted by states of consciousness, Heidegger countered that consciousness is peripheral to the primacy of one's existence (i.e., the mode of being of [[Dasein]]), which cannot be reduced to one's consciousness of it. From this angle, one's state of mind is an "effect" rather than a determinant of existence, including those aspects of existence of which one is not conscious. By shifting the center of gravity from consciousness (psychology) to existence (ontology), Heidegger altered the subsequent direction of phenomenology. As one consequence of Heidegger's modification of Husserl's conception, phenomenology became increasingly relevant to [[psychoanalysis]]. Whereas Husserl gave priority to a depiction of consciousness that was fundamentally alien to the psychoanalytic conception of the unconscious, Heidegger offered a way to conceptualize experience that could accommodate those aspects of one's existence that lie on the periphery of sentient awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Natanson, M. (1973). ''Edmund Husserl: Philosopher of Infinite Tasks''. Evanston: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, R. (1998). ''Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical overview of the use of the term&lt;!--'Dialectical phenomenology' and 'Transcendental phenomenology' redirect here--&gt;==
Phenomenology has at least three main meanings in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] history: one in the writings of [[G. W. F. Hegel]], another in the writings of Edmund Husserl in 1920, and thirdly, succeeding Husserl's work, in the writings of his former research assistant [[Martin Heidegger]] in 1927.
*For [[G. W. F. Hegel]], phenomenology is an approach to [[philosophy]] that begins with an exploration of [[phenomena]] (what presents itself to us in conscious experience) as a means to finally grasp the absolute, logical, ontological and metaphysical Spirit that is behind phenomena. This has been called '''dialectical phenomenology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Roslyn Wallach Bologh, ''Dialectical Phenomenology: Marx's Method'', Routledge, 2009, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*For Edmund Husserl, phenomenology is "the reflective study of the [[essence]] of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|first=David Woodruff
|last=Smith
|title=Husserl
|publisher=Routledge

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenology takes the intuitive experience of [[phenomena]] (whatever presents itself in phenomenological reflexion) as its starting point and tries to extract from it the essential features of experiences and the essence of what we experience. When generalized to the essential features of any possible experience, this has been called '''transcendental phenomenology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (see ''[[#Varieties of phenomenology|Varieties]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Bob Sandmeyer, ''Husserl's Constitutive Phenomenology: Its Problem and Promise'', Routledge, 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl's view was based on aspects of the work of [[Franz Brentano]] and was developed further by philosophers such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Max Scheler]], [[Edith Stein]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]].

Although the term "phenomenology" was used occasionally in the [[history of philosophy]] before [[Husserl]], modern use ties it more explicitly to his particular method. Following is a list of important thinkers, in rough chronological order, who used the term "phenomenology" in a variety of ways, with brief comments on their contributions:&lt;ref&gt;Partially based on

* [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), in the [[Critique of Pure Reason]], distinguished between objects as [[phenomenon|phenomena]], which are objects as shaped and grasped by human sensibility and understanding, and objects as ''things-in-themselves'' or [[noumena]], which do not appear to us in space and time and about which we can make no legitimate judgments.
* G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831) challenged Kant's doctrine of the unknowable thing-in-itself, and declared that by knowing phenomena more fully we can gradually arrive at a consciousness of the absolute and spiritual truth of Divinity, most notably in his ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', published in 1807.
* [[Carl Stumpf]] (1848–1936), student of Brentano and mentor to Husserl, used "phenomenology" to refer to an ontology of sensory contents.{{Citation needed | date = June 2014}}
* [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938) established phenomenology at first as a kind of "descriptive psychology" and later as a transcendental and [[eidetic]] science of consciousness. He is considered to be the founder of contemporary phenomenology.
* [[Max Scheler]] (1874–1928) developed further the phenomenological method of Edmund Husserl and extended it to include also a reduction of the [[scientific method]]. He influenced the thinking of [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]], and [[Edith Stein]].
* [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889–1976) criticized Husserl's theory of phenomenology and attempted to develop a theory of [[ontology]] that led him to his original theory of [[Dasein]], the non-dualistic human being.
* [[Alfred Schütz]] (1899–1959) developed a phenomenology of the social world on the basis of everyday experience that has influenced major sociologists such as [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]], and [[Thomas Luckmann]].
* [[Francisco Varela]] (1946–2001), Chilean philosopher and biologist. Developed the basis for experimental phenomenology and neurophenomenology.

Later usage is mostly based on or (critically) related to Husserl's introduction and use of the term. This branch of philosophy differs from others in that it tends to be more "descriptive" than "[[Prescription and description|prescriptive]]".

==Phenomenological terminology==
===Intentionality===
{{Main|Intentionality|l1=Intentionality}}
Intentionality refers to the notion that consciousness is always the consciousness ''of'' something. The word itself should not be confused with the "ordinary" use of the word intentional, but should rather be taken as playing on the etymological roots of the word. Originally, intention referred to a "stretching out" ("in tension," from Latin ''intendere''), and in this context it refers to consciousness "stretching out" towards its object. However, one should be careful with this image: there is not some consciousness first that, subsequently, stretches out to its object; rather, consciousness ''occurs as'' the simultaneity of a conscious act and its object.

Intentionality is often summed up as "aboutness." Whether this ''something'' that consciousness is about is in direct perception or in fantasy is inconsequential to the concept of intentionality itself; whatever consciousness is directed at, ''that'' is what consciousness is conscious of. This means that the object of consciousness doesn't ''have'' to be a ''physical'' object apprehended in [[perception]]: it can just as well be a fantasy or a memory. Consequently, these "structures" of consciousness, i.e., perception, memory, fantasy, etc., are called ''intentionalities''.

The term "intentionality" originated with the [[Scholastics]] in the medieval period and was resurrected by Brentano who in turn influenced Husserl's conception of phenomenology, who refined the term and made it the cornerstone of his theory of consciousness. The meaning of the term is complex and depends entirely on how it is conceived by a given philosopher. The term should not be confused with "intention" or the psychoanalytic conception of unconscious "motive" or "gain".

===Intuition===
{{Main|Intuition|l1=Intuition}}
[[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] in phenomenology refers to cases where the intentional object is directly present to the intentionality at play; if the intention is "filled" by the direct apprehension of the object, you have an intuited object. Having a cup of coffee in front of you, for instance, seeing it, feeling it, or even imagining it – these are all filled intentions, and the object is then ''intuited''. The same goes for the apprehension of mathematical formulae or a number. If you do not have the object as referred to directly, the object is not intuited, but still intended, but then ''emptily''. Examples of empty intentions can be signitive intentions – intentions that only ''imply'' or ''refer to'' their objects.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Evidence===
In everyday language, we use the word [[evidence]] to signify a special sort of relation between a state of affairs and a proposition: State A is evidence for the proposition "A is true." In phenomenology, however, the concept of evidence is meant to signify the "subjective achievement of truth."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Sokolowski, ''Introduction to Phenomenology'', Cambridge University Press (2000). Pp. 159–160. This use of the word evidence may seem strange in English, but is more common in German, which is the language Husserl wrote in.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not an attempt to reduce the objective sort of evidence to subjective "opinion," but rather an attempt to describe the structure of having something present in intuition with the addition of having it present as ''intelligible'': "Evidence is the successful presentation of an intelligible object, the successful presentation of something whose truth becomes manifest in the evidencing itself."&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, ''Introduction'', pp. 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noesis and noema===
{{Main|Noema}}
In Husserl's phenomenology, which is quite common, this pair of terms, derived from the Greek ''[[nous]]'' (mind), designate respectively the real content, noesis, and the ideal content, noema, of an intentional act (an act of consciousness). The [[Noesis]] is the part of the act that gives it a particular sense or character (as in judging or perceiving something, loving or hating it, accepting or rejecting it, and so on). This is real in the sense that it is actually part of what takes place in the consciousness (or psyche) of the subject of the act. The [[Noesis]] is always correlated with a [[Noema]]; for Husserl, the full Noema is a complex ideal structure comprising at least a noematic sense and a noematic core. The correct interpretation of what Husserl meant by the [[Noema]] has long been controversial, but the noematic sense is generally understood as the ideal meaning of the act&lt;ref&gt;I.e. if A loves B, loving is a real part of A's conscious activity – [[Noesis]] – but gets its sense from the general concept of loving, which has an abstract or ideal meaning, as "loving" has a meaning in the English language independently of what an individual means by the word when they use it.&lt;/ref&gt; and the noematic core as the act's referent or object ''as it is meant in the act''. One element of controversy is whether this noematic object is the same as the actual object of the act (assuming it exists) or is some kind of ideal object.&lt;ref&gt;For a full account of the controversy and a review of positions taken, see David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, pp304-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empathy and intersubjectivity===
{{See also|Empathy|Intersubjectivity}}
In phenomenology, [[empathy]] refers to the experience of one's own body ''as'' another. While we often identify others with their physical bodies, this type of phenomenology requires that we focus on the [[subjectivity]] of the other, as well as our intersubjective engagement with them. In Husserl's original account, this was done by a sort of [[apperception]] built on the experiences of your own lived-body. The [[lived body]] is your own body as experienced by yourself, ''as'' yourself. Your own body manifests itself to you mainly as your possibilities of acting in the world. It is what lets you reach out and grab something, for instance, but it also, and more importantly, allows for the possibility of changing your point of view. This helps you differentiate one thing from another by the experience of moving around it, seeing new aspects of it (often referred to as making the absent present and the present absent), and still retaining the notion that this is the same thing that you saw other aspects of just a moment ago (it is identical). Your body is also experienced as a duality, both as object (you can touch your own hand) and as your own subjectivity (you experience being touched).

The experience of your own body as your own subjectivity is then applied to the experience of another's body, which, through apperception, is constituted as another subjectivity. You can thus recognise the Other's intentions, emotions, etc. This experience of empathy is important in the phenomenological account of [[intersubjectivity]]. In phenomenology, intersubjectivity constitutes objectivity (i.e., what you experience as objective is experienced as being intersubjectively available – available to all other subjects. This does not imply that objectivity is reduced to subjectivity nor does it imply a relativist position, cf. for instance [[intersubjective verifiability]]).

In the experience of intersubjectivity, one also experiences oneself as being a subject among other subjects, and one experiences oneself as existing objectively ''for'' these [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]s; one experiences oneself as the noema of Others' noeses, or as a subject in another's empathic experience. As such, one experiences oneself as objectively existing subjectivity. Intersubjectivity is also a part in the constitution of one's lifeworld, especially as "homeworld."

===Lifeworld===
{{Main|Lifeworld}}
The [[lifeworld]] (German: ''Lebenswelt'') is the "world" each one of us ''lives'' in. One could call it the "background" or "horizon" of all experience, and it is that on which each object stands out as itself (as different) and with the meaning it can only hold for us. The lifeworld is both personal and [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] (it is then called a "homeworld"), and, as such, it does not enclose each one of us in a [[solipsism|solus ipse]].

==Husserl's ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (1900/1901)==
In the first edition of the ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'', still under the influence of Brentano, Husserl describes his position as "descriptive psychology." Husserl analyzes the intentional structures of mental acts and how they are directed at both real and ideal objects. The first volume of the ''Logical Investigations'', the ''Prolegomena to Pure Logic'', begins with a devastating critique of [[psychologism]], i.e., the attempt to subsume the ''a priori'' validity of the laws of logic under psychology. Husserl establishes a separate field for research in logic, philosophy, and phenomenology, independently from the empirical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;On the ''Logical Investigations'', see

==Transcendental phenomenology after the ''Ideen'' (1913)==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
Some years after the publication of the ''Logical Investigations'', Husserl made some key elaborations that led him to the distinction between the act of consciousness (''noesis'') and the phenomena at which it is directed (the ''noemata'').
* "noetic" refers to the intentional act of consciousness (believing, willing, etc.)
* "noematic" refers to the object or content (noema), which appears in the noetic acts (the believed, wanted, hated, and loved ...).

What we observe is not the object as it is in itself, but how and inasmuch it is given in the intentional acts. Knowledge of [[essence]]s would only be possible by "bracketing" all assumptions about the existence of an external world and the inessential (subjective) aspects of how the object is concretely given to us. This procedure Husserl called ''epoché''.

Husserl in a later period concentrated more on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. As he wanted to exclude any hypothesis on the existence of external objects, he introduced the method of phenomenological reduction to eliminate them. What was left over was the pure [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] ego, as opposed to the concrete empirical ego. Now [[Transcendence (philosophy)|Transcendental Phenomenology]] is the study of the essential structures that are left in pure consciousness: This amounts in practice to the study of the noemata and the relations among them. The philosopher [[Theodor Adorno]] criticised Husserl's concept of phenomenological epistemology in his metacritique ''Against Epistemology'', which is [[Anti-foundationalism|anti-foundationalist]] in its stance.

Transcendental phenomenologists include [[Oskar Becker]], [[Aron Gurwitsch]], and [[Alfred Schütz]].

==Realist phenomenology==
{{Main|Munich phenomenology}}
After Husserl's publication of the ''Ideen'' in 1913, many phenomenologists took a critical stance towards his new theories. Especially the members of the [[Munich phenomenology|Munich group]] distanced themselves from his new transcendental phenomenology and preferred the earlier realist phenomenology of the first edition of the ''Logical Investigations''.

Realist phenomenologists include [[Adolf Reinach]], [[Alexander Pfänder]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Johannes Daubert|de}}, [[Max Scheler]], [[Roman Ingarden]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]].

==Existential phenomenology==
{{Main|Existential phenomenology}}
Existential phenomenology differs from transcendental phenomenology by its rejection of the transcendental ego. Merleau-Ponty objects to the ego's transcendence of the world, which for Husserl leaves the world spread out and completely transparent before the conscious. Heidegger thinks of a conscious being as always already in the world. Transcendence is maintained in existential phenomenology to the extent that the method of phenomenology must take a presuppositionless starting point – transcending claims about the world arising from, for example, natural or scientific attitudes or theories of the [[ontology|ontological]] nature of the world.

While [[Husserl]] thought of philosophy as a scientific discipline that had to be founded on a phenomenology understood as [[epistemology]], [[Martin Heidegger]] held a radically different view. Heidegger himself states their differences this way:
:''For Husserl, the phenomenological reduction is the method of leading phenomenological vision from the natural attitude of the human being whose life is involved in the world of things and persons back to the transcendental life of consciousness and its noetic-noematic experiences, in which objects are constituted as correlates of consciousness. For us, phenomenological reduction means leading phenomenological vision back from the apprehension of a being, whatever may be the character of that apprehension, to the understanding of the Being of this being (projecting upon the way it is unconcealed).''&lt;ref name="heideproblems"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Heidegger, philosophy was not at all a scientific discipline, but more fundamental than science itself. According to him science is only one way of knowing the world with no special access to truth. Furthermore, the scientific mindset itself is built on a much more "primordial" foundation of practical, everyday knowledge. Husserl was skeptical of this approach, which he regarded as quasi-mystical, and it contributed to the divergence in their thinking.

Instead of taking phenomenology as ''prima philosophia'' or a foundational discipline, Heidegger took it as a metaphysical ontology: "''being is the proper and sole theme of philosophy''... this means that philosophy is not a science of beings but of being."&lt;ref name="heideproblems"/&gt; Yet to confuse phenomenology and ontology is an obvious error. Phenomena are not the foundation or Ground of Being. Neither are they appearances, for, as Heidegger argues in ''[[Being and Time]]'', an appearance is "that which shows itself in something else," while a phenomenon is "that which shows itself in itself."

While for Husserl, in the epoché, being appeared only as a correlate of consciousness, for Heidegger being is the starting point. While for Husserl we would have to abstract from all concrete determinations of our empirical ego, to be able to turn to the field of pure consciousness, Heidegger claims that "the possibilities and destinies of philosophy are bound up with man's existence, and thus with temporality and with historicality."&lt;ref name="heideproblems"/&gt;

However, ontological being and existential being are different categories, so Heidegger's conflation of these categories is, according to Husserl's view, the root of Heidegger's error. Husserl charged Heidegger with raising the question of ontology but failing to answer it, instead switching the topic to the Dasein, the only being for whom Being is an issue. That is neither ontology nor phenomenology, according to Husserl, but merely abstract anthropology. To clarify, perhaps, by abstract anthropology, as a non-existentialist searching for essences, Husserl rejected the existentialism implicit in Heidegger's distinction between beings qua existents as things in reality and their Being as it unfolds in Dasein's own reflections on its being-in-the-world, wherein being becomes present to us, that is, is unconcealed.&lt;ref&gt;I have attempted to respond to the request for clarification of Heidegger's distinction between being and Being. My info source was http://www.uni.edu/boedeker/NNhHeidegger2.doc. It was not copied and pasted but rephrased for copyright reasons.&lt;/ref&gt;

Existential phenomenologists include: [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889–1976), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Karl Jaspers]] (1883–1969), [[Emmanuel Levinas]] (1906–1995), [[Gabriel Marcel]] (1889–1973), [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (1905–1980), [[Paul Ricoeur]] (1913–2005) and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] (1908–1961).

==Eastern thought==
Some researchers in phenomenology (in particular in reference to Heidegger's legacy) see possibilities of establishing dialogues with traditions of thought outside of the so-called [[Western philosophy]], particularly with respect to [[Eastern philosophy|East-Asian thinking]], and despite perceived differences between "Eastern" and "Western".&lt;ref&gt;See for instance references to Heidegger's "A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer," in ''On the Way to Language'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1971). Heidegger himself had contacts with some leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the [[Kyoto School]], notably [[Hajime Tanabe]], [[Kuki Shūzō]] and [[Kiyoshi Miki]].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it has been claimed that a number of elements within phenomenology (mainly Heidegger's thought) have some resonance with Eastern philosophical ideas, particularly with [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;An account given by Paul Hsao (in ''Heidegger and Asian Thought'') records a remark by Chang Chung-Yuan claiming that "Heidegger is the only Western Philosopher who not only intellectually understands but has intuitively grasped Taoist thought"&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Tomonobu Imamichi]], the concept of ''Dasein'' was inspired – although Heidegger remained silent on this – by [[Okakura Kakuzo]]'s concept of ''das-in-der-Welt-sein'' (being in the world) expressed in ''[[The Book of Tea]]'' to describe [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]'s philosophy, which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having studied with him the year before.&lt;ref name=Imamichi&gt;[[Tomonobu Imamichi]], ''In Search of Wisdom. One Philosopher's Journey'', Tokyo, International House of Japan, 2004 (quoted by Anne Fagot-Largeau during her [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm lesson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206183341/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm |date=6 February 2009 }} at the [[Collège de France]] on 7 December 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also recent signs of the reception of phenomenology (and Heidegger's thought in particular) within scholarly circles focused on studying the impetus of [[metaphysics]] in the [[history of ideas]] in [[Islam]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy]] such as in the works of the Lebanese philosopher [[Nader El-Bizri]];&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: [[Nader El-Bizri]], ''The Phenomenological Quest between [[Avicenna]] and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000) {{ISBN|1-58684-005-3}}; refer also to many of his other studies and commentaries on Heidegger, including one of his latest studies: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB. Philosophia'', Vol. 60, No. 1 (2015): 5-30&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps this is tangentially due to the indirect influence of the tradition of the French Orientalist and phenomenologist [[Henri Corbin]], and later accentuated through El-Bizri's dialogues with the Polish phenomenologist [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]].&lt;ref&gt;A book-series under the title: [https://www.springer.com/series/6137 ''Islamic Philosophy and Occidental Phenomenology in Dialogue''] has been recently established by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] (Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht) in association with the [http://www.phenomenology.org World Phenomenology Institute]. This initiative has been initiated by the Polish phenomenologist [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]], editor of ''Analecta Husserliana'', and is co-edited by [[Nader El-Bizri]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the work of [[Jim Ruddy]] in the field of [[comparative philosophy]], combined the concept of Transcendental Ego in Husserl's phenomenology with the concept of the primacy of self-consciousness in the work of Sankaracharya. In the course of this work, Ruddy uncovered a wholly new eidetic phenomenological science, which he called "convergent phenomenology." This new phenomenology takes over where Husserl left off, and deals with the constitution of relation-like, rather than merely thing-like, or "intentional" objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;See the thesis, "Convergent Phenomenology," presented to the University of Madras, June 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technoethics==

===Phenomenological approach to technology===
James Moor has argued that computers show up policy vacuums that require new thinking and the establishment of new policies.&lt;ref&gt;Moor, J. H. (1985). "What Is Computer Ethics?" In T. W. Bynum (ed.), Computersand Ethics. Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that the resources provided by classical ethical theory such as [[utilitarianism]], [[consequentialism]] and deontological ethics is more than enough to deal with all the ethical issues emerging from our design and use of information technology.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, G. (1999). Common Morality and Computing. Ethics and Information Technology 1(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

For the phenomenologist the 'impact view' of [[technology]] as well as the constructivist view of the technology/society relationships is valid but not adequate (Heidegger 1977, Borgmann 1985, Winograd and Flores 1987, Ihde 1990, Dreyfus 1992, 2001). They argue that these accounts of technology, and the [[technology]]/[[society]] relationship, posit [[technology]] and society as if speaking about the one does not immediately and already draw upon the other for its ongoing sense or meaning. For the phenomenologist, [[society]] and [[technology]] co-constitute each other; they are each other's ongoing condition, or possibility for being what they are. For them technology is not just the artifact. Rather, the artifact already emerges from a prior 'technological' attitude towards the world (Heidegger 1977).

===Heidegger's approach (pre-technological age)===
For Heidegger the essence of technology is the way of being of modern humans—a way of conducting themselves towards the world—that sees the world as something to be ordered and shaped in line with projects, intentions and desires—a 'will to power' that manifests itself as a 'will to technology'.&lt;ref name="Introna, L. 2005"&gt;Introna, L. (2005) Disclosing the Digital Face: The ethics of facial recognition systems, Ethics and Information Technology, 7(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
Heidegger claims that there were other times in human history, a pre-modern time, where humans did not orient themselves towards the world in a technological way—simply as resources for our purposes.&lt;ref name="Introna, L. 2005"/&gt;

However, according to Heidegger this 'pre-technological' age (or mood) is one where humans' relation with the world and artifacts, their way of being disposed, was poetic and aesthetic rather than technological (enframing).&lt;ref name="Introna, L. 2005"/&gt; There are many who disagree with Heidegger's account of the modern technological attitude as the 'enframing' of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Feenberg, A. (1999) 'Technology and Meaning', in Questioning Technology, London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Andrew Feenberg]] argues that Heidegger's account of modern technology is not borne out in contemporary everyday encounters with [[technology]].&lt;ref name="Introna, L. 2005"/&gt; [[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] has written on the anti-Semitism rooted in Heidegger's view of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, Christian (2015) "Martin Heidegger's Anti-Semitism: Philosophy of Technology and the Media in the Light of the Black Notebooks." Triple-C Vol 13, No 1. Accessed 4 May 2017. &lt;http://www.triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/650/690&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Hubert Dreyfus approach (contemporary society)===
In critiquing the artificial intelligence (AI) programme, [[Hubert Dreyfus]] (1992) argues that the way skill development has become understood in the past has been wrong. He argues, this is the model that the early artificial intelligence community uncritically adopted. In opposition to this view, he argues, with Heidegger, that what we observe when we learn a new skill in everyday practice is in fact the opposite. We most often start with explicit rules or preformulated approaches and then move to a multiplicity of particular cases, as we become an expert. His argument draws directly on Heidegger's account in "Being and Time" of humans as beings that are always already situated in-the-world. As humans 'in-the-world', we are already experts at going about everyday life, at dealing with the subtleties of every particular situation; that is why everyday life seems so obvious. Thus, the intricate expertise of everyday activity is forgotten and taken for granted by AI as an assumed starting point.&lt;ref name="Introna, L. 2005"/&gt;
What Dreyfus highlighted in his critique of AI was the fact that technology (AI algorithms) does not make sense by itself. It is the assumed, and forgotten, horizon of everyday practice that makes technological devices and solutions show up as meaningful. If we are to understand technology we need to 'return' to the horizon of meaning that made it show up as the artifacts we need, want and desire. We need to consider how these technologies reveal (or disclose) us.&lt;ref name="Introna, L. 2005"/&gt;

'''Post-normal science''' ('''PNS''') represents a novel approach for the use of science on issues where "facts [are] uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent".&lt;ref name="PNS3" /&gt; PNS was developed in the 1990s by [[Silvio Funtowicz]] and [[Jerome R. Ravetz]].&lt;ref name="PNS1"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. and Ravetz, J. R., 1991. "A New Scientific Methodology for Global Environmental Issues", in Costanza, R. (ed.), Ecological Economics: The Science and Management of Sustainability: 137–152. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNS2"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. and Ravetz, J. R., 1992. "Three types of risk assessment and the emergence of postnormal science", in Krimsky, S. and Golding, D. (eds.), Social theories of risk: 251–273. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNS3"&gt;Funtowicz, S. and Ravetz, J., 1993. "Science for the post-normal age", Futures, 31(7): 735-755.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be considered as a reaction to the styles of analysis based on risk and cost-benefit analysis prevailing at that time, and as an embodiment of concepts of a new "critical science" developed in previous works by the same authors.&lt;ref name="UQSP"&gt;Funtowicz, S. and Ravetz, J., 1990. [[Uncertainty and quality in science for policy]]. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SK_1971"&gt;Ravetz, J. R., 1971. Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent work PNS is described as "the stage where we are today, where all the comfortable assumptions about science, its production and its use, are in question".&lt;ref name="no-nonsense"&gt;Ravetz, J.R., 2006, The [[No nonsense guide to science]], New Internationalist.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==

In 1962, [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' introduced the concept of [[normal science]] as part of his theory that scientific knowledge progresses through socially constructed [[paradigm shift]]s, where normal science is what most scientists do all the time and what all scientists do most of the time. The process of a paradigm shift is essentially as follows:
* from normal science (the rules are agreed upon or disagreed upon in debates that cannot be concluded; science is puzzle solving, but some contradictions in theory cannot be resolved)
* to revolutionary science (important rules are called into question; contradictions may be resolved; paradigms shift)
* to new normal science (new rules are accepted, science returns to puzzle solving under new rules).

An illustration of the theory in practice is the [[Copernican revolution]], where Copernicus’ idea of a (sun-centered) solar system was largely ignored (not in the rules) when first introduced; then [[Galileo]] was deemed a heretic for supporting the idea (rules called into question); and finally, after a revolution in cosmology, the solar system became an obvious and foundational part of scientific knowledge (new rules).

Another example is the question of whether light is [[Wave–particle duality|a particle or a wave]]. For a long time there was debate on this point. Advocates on both sides had many valid arguments based on scientific evidence but were lacking a theory that would resolve the conflict. After a revolution in thinking, it was realized that both perspectives could be true.

Physicist and policy adviser [[James J. Kay]] described post-normal science as a process that recognizes the potential for gaps in knowledge and understanding that cannot be resolved in ways other than revolutionary science. He [http://www.jameskay.ca/pns/ argued] that (between revolutions) one should not necessarily attempt to resolve or dismiss contradictory perspectives of the world, whether they are based on science or not, but instead incorporate multiple viewpoints into the same problem-solving process. From the ecological perspective post-normal science can be situated in the context of 'crisis disciplines' – a term coined by the conservation biologist [[Michael E. Soulé]] to indicate approaches addressing fears, emerging in the seventies, that the world was on the verge of [[ecological collapse]]. In this respect Michael Egan&lt;ref name="Egan"&gt;Egan, M., 2018, Survival Science: Crisis Disciplines and the Shock of the Environment in the 1970s, Centaurus 2018: doi:10.1111/1600-0498.12149.&lt;/ref&gt; defines PNS as a 'survival science'.

Moving from PNS [[Ziauddin Sardar]] developed the concept of [[Postnormal Times]] (PNT). Sardar was the editor of [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/futures FUTURES] when it published the article ‘Science for the post-normal age’&lt;ref name="PNS3" /&gt; presently the most cited paper of the journal . A recent review of academic literature conducted on the [[Web of Science]] and encompassing the topics of Futures studies, Foresight, Forecasting and Anticipation Practice &lt;ref name="Gauthier" /&gt; identifies the same paper as "the all-time publication that received the highest number of citations". 

==Content==
"At birth Post-normal science was conceived as an inclusive set of robust insights more than as an exclusive fully structured theory or field of practice".&lt;ref name="Personal"&gt;Funtowicz, S., 2016, personal correspondence.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ideas underpinning PNS can already be found in a work published in 1983 and entitled "Three types of risk assessment: a methodological analysis" &lt;ref name="ThreeTypes_1983"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. and Ravetz, J. R. (1985), Three types of risk assessment: a methodological analysis, in C. Whipple and V. T. Covello (Eds), Risk Analysis in the Private Sector, pp 217-232 (Plenum, New York).&lt;/ref&gt; This and subsequent works &lt;ref name="PNS1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PNS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PNS3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UQSP" /&gt; show that PNS concentrates on few aspects of the complex relation between science and policy: the communication of uncertainty, the assessment of quality, and the justification and practice of the extended peer communities.

The horizontal axis represents ‘Systems Uncertainties’ and the vertical one ‘Decision Stakes’. The three quadrants identify Applied Science, Professional Consultancy, and Post-Normal Science. Different standards of quality and styles of analysis are appropriate to different regions in the diagram, i.e. Post-normal science does not claim relevance and cogency on all of science's application but only on those defined by the PNS's [[mantram]] with a fourfold challenge:  : ‘facts uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent’. For applied research science’s own peer quality control system will suffice (or so was assumed at the moment PNS was formulated in the early nineties), while professional consultancy was considered appropriate for these settings which cannot be ‘peer-reviewed’, and where the skills and the tacit knowledge of a practitioner are needed at the forefront, e.g. in a surgery room, or in a house on fire. Here a surgeon or a fireman takes a difficult technical decision based on her or his training and appreciation of the situation (the Greek concept of ‘[[Metis (mythology)]]’).

==Complexity==  
There are important linkages between PNS and complexity science,&lt;ref name="Complexity"&gt;Rees, M., 2017, Black holes are simpler than forests and science has its limits, [https://aeon.co/amp/ideas/black-holes-are-simpler-than-forests-and-science-has-its-limits AEON, 01 December].&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. system ecology ([[C. S. Holling]]) and hierarchy theory ([[Arthur Koestler]]). In PNS, complexity is respected through its recognition of a multiplicity of legitimate perspectives on any issue; and reflexivity is realised through the extension of accepted ‘facts’ beyond the supposedly objective productions of traditional research. Also, the new participants in the process are not treated as passive learners at the feet of the experts, being coercively convinced through scientific demonstration. Rather, they will form an ‘extended peer community’, sharing the work of quality assurance of the scientific inputs to the process, and arriving at a resolution of issues through debate and dialogue.&lt;ref name="Poetry_Thermod"&gt;Funtowicz, S., and Ravetz, J.R., THE POETRY OF THERMODYNAMICS, Energy, entropy/exergy and quality, Futures, Vol. 29, No. 9. pp. 791-810, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extended Peer Community==

PNS concept of extended peer community moves from and transcends the familiar concept of scientific peer community relative to a well-defined field of scientific research.
The peer community is extended in two respects: first, more than one discipline is assumed to have a potential bearing on the issue being debated, thereby providing different lenses to consider the problem. Second the community is extended to lay actors, taken to be all those with stakes, or an interest, in the given issue. Perhaps the best justification of the concept is offered by Paul Feyerabend in Against Method &lt;ref name="Feyerabend1975"&gt;Feyerabend, P. (1975). Against method. Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;. For Feyerabend the participation of experts together with non-experts would allow the citizens to mature, inter alia by realizing that the experts are themselves lay-people outside their restricted field of competence. For Giandomenico Majone &lt;ref name="Majone1989"&gt;Majone, G. (1989). Evidence, argument, and persuasion in the policy process. Yale University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; "In any area of public policy the choice of instruments, far from being a technical exercise that can be safely delegated to the experts, reflects as in a microcosm all the political, moral, and cultural dimensions of policy-making." The same author notes: "Dialectical confrontation between generalists and experts often succeeds in bringing out unstated assumptions, conflicting interpretations of the facts, and the risks posed by the projects". These considerations justifies the need for an extended peer community, as the arena where the policy instruments and options can be discussed with - but without deference to - the experts and the authorities. 

The lay members of the community thus constituted may also take upon themselves active 'research' tasks; this has happened e.g. in the so-called 'popular epidemiology' &lt;ref name="Brown1997"&gt;Brown, P. (1997). Popular Epidemiology Revisited. Current Sociology, 45(3), 137–156.&lt;/ref&gt;, when the official authorities have shown reticence to perform investigations deemed necessary by the communities affected - for example - by a case of air or water pollution &lt;ref name="Fjelland2016"&gt;Fjelland, R. (2016). When Laypeople are Right and Experts are Wrong: Lessons from Love Canal. International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry, 22(1), 105–125.&lt;/ref&gt; , and more recently ‘citizen science’ &lt;ref name="Stilgoe2009"&gt;Stilgoe, J. (2009). Citizen Scientists: Reconnecting Science with Civil Society. London: Demos.&lt;/ref&gt;. The extended community can usefully investigate the quality of the scientific assessments provided by the experts, the definition of the problem, as well as research priorities and research questions &lt;ref name="Miedema2016"&gt;Miedema, F. (2016, May 12). To confront 21st century challenges, science must rethink its reward system | Science | The Guardian. The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Thus, the extension of the peer community is not only ethically fair or politically correct, but also enhances the quality of the relevant science. An example is provided by Brian Wynne, who discusses the Cumbrian sheep farmers' interaction with scientist and authorities in the relation to the Chernobyl radioactive fallout &lt;ref name="Wynne1992"&gt;Wynne, B. (1992). Misunderstood misunderstanding: social identities and public uptake of science. Public Understanding of Science, 1, 281–304.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Applications==


Beside its dominating influence in the literature on 'futures'&lt;ref name="Gauthier"&gt; Thomas Gauthier, Sylvaine Mercuri Chapuis, 2018, An Investigation of Futures Studies Scholarly Literature, In: Poli R. (eds) Handbook of Anticipation. Springer, Cham &lt;/ref&gt;, PNS is considered to have influenced the ecological ‘conservation versus preservation debate’, especially via its reading by American pragmatist [https://www.iac.gatech.edu/people/faculty/norton Bryan G. Norton]. According to Jozef Keulartz &lt;ref name="Keulartz"&gt;Keulartz, J. (2018). Does Deliberation Promote Ecological Citizenship? The Convergence Hypothesis and the Reality of Polarization. In S. Sarkar &amp; B. A. Minteer (Eds.), A Sustainable Philosophy—The Work of Bryan Norton, The International Library of Environmental, Agricultural and Food Ethics 26. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; the PNS concept of "extended peer community" influenced how Norton's developed his 'convergence hypothesis'. The hypothesis posits that ecologists of different orientation will converge once they start thinking 'as a mountain', or as a planet. For Norton this will be achieved via deliberative democracy, which will pragmatically overcome the black and white divide between conservationists and preservationists.

Other authors &lt;ref name="Heaslip"&gt;Heaslip, E., &amp; Fahy, F. (2018). Developing transdisciplinary approaches to community energy transitions: An island case study. Energy Research &amp; Social Science.&lt;/ref&gt; attribute to PNS the role of having stimulated the take up of transdisciplinary methodological frameworks, reliant on the social constructivist perspective embedded in PNS.

Today Post-normal science is intended as applicable to most instances where the use of evidence is contested due to different norms and values.

As summarized in a recent work "the ideas and concepts of post normal science bring about the emergence of new problem solving strategies in which the role of science is appreciated in its full context of the complexity and the uncertainty of natural systems and the relevance of human commitments and values.&lt;ref name="Lister"&gt;Lister, A. R., Ingram, J. C., Briehl, M. M., &amp; Diana, S. (2018). THE BIOACCUMULATION OF URANIUM IN SHEEP HEART AND KIDNEY: THE IMPACT OF CONTAMINATED TRADITIONAL FOOD SOURCES ON THE NAVAJO RESERVATION. ProQuest, 10817030. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/openview/ab771b94df56ad747c9a64e499803e88/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y&lt;/ref&gt;

For Peter Gluckman (2014), chief science advisor to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, post normal science approaches are today appropriate for a host of problems including  "eradication of exogenous pests […], offshore oil prospecting, legalization of recreational psychotropic drugs, water quality, family violence, obesity, teenage morbidity and suicide, the ageing population, the prioritization of early-childhood education, reduction of agricultural greenhouse gases, and balancing economic growth and environmental sustainability".&lt;ref name="Gluckman"&gt;Gluckman, P., 2014, Policy: The art of science advice to government, Nature, 507, 163–165.&lt;/ref&gt;
For Carrozza &lt;ref name="Carrozza"&gt;Carrozza, C. (2015). Democratizing Expertise and Environmental Governance: Different Approaches to the Politics of Science and their Relevance for Policy Analysis. Journal of Environmental Policy &amp; Planning, 17(1), 108-126.&lt;/ref&gt; PNS can be "framed in terms of a call for the ‘democratization of expertise’", and as a "reaction against long-term trends of ‘scientization’ of politics—the tendency towards assigning to experts a critical role in policymaking while marginalizing laypeople". For Mike Hulme (2007), writing on ''[[The Guardian]]'' Climate change seems falls into the category of issues which are best dealt with in the context of PNS and notes that "Disputes in post-normal science focus as often on the process of science - who gets funded, who evaluates quality, who has the ear of policy - as on the facts of science".&lt;ref&gt;

==Criticism==
A criticism of post-normal science is offered by Weingart (1997)&lt;ref name="PNS4"&gt;Weingart, P.  From "Finalization" to "Mode 2":  old wine in new bottles?.  Social Science Information 36 (4), 1997. Pp. 591-613.&lt;/ref&gt; for whom Post-normal science does not introduce a new epistemology but retraces earlier debates linked to the so-called "finalization thesis".

== Special issues ==

The journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/futures FUTURES] devoted several specials issues to PNS.

* The first was in [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00163287/31/7 1999] and included as editorial two pieces: from [[Jerome Ravetz]] and [[Silvio Funtowicz]], [http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/Editorials1.pdf Post-Normal Science—an insight now maturing], and from [[Jerome Ravetz]]: [http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/Editorials2.pdf What is Post-Normal Science].
* The second [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00163287/43/2 special issue], edited by [[Merryl Wyn Davies]], was entitled "Post normal times" in 2011.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;Davies, M.W., Editor, 2011, Special Issue: Postnormal Times
Futures, Volume 43, Issue 2, Pages 135-228 (March 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; This was a selection of papers from the symposium "Post Normal Science – perspectives &amp; prospectives 26-27th June 2009, Oxford." A summary of the abstracts can be found on the [http://www.nusap.net/article.php?sid=48 NUSAP net].

* The third [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301921 special issue on PNS was in 2017]. This special issue contains a selection of papers discussed at the [[University of Bergen]]'s Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities between 2014 and 2016. The issue includes also two extended commentaries on the present crisis in science and the post-fact/post-truth discourse, one from Europe ([http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301969 Saltelli and Funtowicz]) and one from Japan ([http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301829 Tsukahara]). All articles in this special issue are in open access.

Another special issue on Post Normal Science was published on the journal [[Science, Technology &amp; Human Values]] in [http://nusap.net/article.php?sid=49 May 2011].

==Recent production==
A group of scholars of PNS orientation has published in 2016 a volume on the quality control crisis of science.&lt;ref name="Benessia"&gt;Benessia, A., Funtowicz, S., Giampietro, M., Guimarães Pereira, A., Ravetz, J., Saltelli, A., Strand, R., van der Sluijs, J., 2016.

==Quantitative approaches== 
Among the quantitative styles of analysis which make reference to post-normal science one can mention [[NUSAP]] for numerical information, [[sensitivity auditing]] for indicators and mathematical modelling and [[MUSIASEM]] in the field of social metabolism.

==Mathematical modelling==
In relation to mathematical modelling PNS suggests a participatory approach, whereby ‘models to predict and control the future’ are replaced by ‘models to map our ignorance about the future’, in the process exploring and revealing the metaphors embedded in the model. &lt;ref name="Metaphor"&gt;Ravetz, J. R. Models as metaphors. in Public participation in sustainability science : a handbook (ed. B. Kasemir, J. Jäger, C. Jaeger, Gardner Matthew T., Clark William C.,  and W. A.) (Cambridge University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; PNS is also known for the its definition of GIGO: in modelling GIGO occurs when the uncertainties in the inputs must be suppressed, lest the outputs become completely indeterminate. &lt;ref name="OldPNSpaper"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O., and Ravetz, J. R. 1990, Post-normal science: A new science for new times, Scientific European, October 1990, p. 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{MahayanaBuddhism}}
'''Prajñāpāramitā''' means "the Perfection of (Transcendent) Wisdom" in [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna Buddhism]]. Prajñāpāramitā refers to this perfected way of seeing the nature of reality, as well as to a particular body of [[sutra]]s and to the personification of the concept in the [[Bodhisattva]] known as the "Great Mother" (Tibetan: Yum Chenmo). The word ''Prajñāpāramitā'' combines the [[Sanskrit]] words ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]]'' "wisdom" with ''[[pāramitā]]'' "perfection". Prajñāpāramitā is a central concept in [[Mahāyāna Buddhism]] and is generally associated with the doctrine of emptiness ([[Shunyata]]) or 'lack of [[Svabhava]]' (essence) and the works of [[Nagarjuna]]. Its practice and understanding are taken to be indispensable elements of the [[Bodhisattva]] path.

According to [[Edward Conze]], the Prajñāpāramitā Sutras are "a collection of about forty texts ... composed somewhere around Indian subcontinent between approximately 100 BC and AD 600."&lt;ref&gt;Conze, E. Perfect Wisdom: The Short Prajnaparamita Texts, Buddhist Publishing Group, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Some Prajnāpāramitā sūtras are thought to be among the earliest [[Mahāyāna sūtras]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge, 2000, pages 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations 2nd edition.'' Routledge, 2009, pg. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the important features of the Prajñāpāramitā Sutras is [[anutpada]] (unborn, no origin).&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert; Lopez, Donald S. Jr., eds. (2014), ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'', Princeton University Press pg. 945   "In the PRAJÑĀPĀRAMITĀ literature and the MADHYAMAKA school,  the notion of production comes under specific criticism  (see VAJRAKAṆĀ),  with NĀGĀRJUNA famously asking,  e.g.,  how an effect can be produced from a cause that is either the same as or different from itself.  The prajñāpāramitā sūtras thus famously declare that all dharmas are actually ANUTPĀDA,  or “unproduced.”"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, Richard (1995), ''Early Advaita Vedānta and Buddhism: The Mahāyāna Context of the Gauḍapādīya-kārikā'', SUNY Press pg.113 "It is equally apparent that one of the important features of the Prajnaparamita positition is that of the nonarising (anutpada) of dharmas."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Earliest texts===

====''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā}}''====
Western scholars have traditionally considered the earliest sūtra in the Prajñāpāramitā class to be the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' or "Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 Lines", which was probably put in writing in the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Mäll, Linnart. ''Studies in the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā and other essays.'' 2005. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This chronology is based on the views of [[Edward Conze]], who largely considered dates of translation into other languages. This text also has a corresponding version in verse format, called the ''{{IAST|Ratnaguṇasaṃcaya Gāthā}}'', which some believe to be slightly older because it is not written in standard literary Sanskrit. However, these findings rely on late-dating Indian texts, in which verses and mantras are often kept in more archaic forms.

Additionally, a number of scholars have proposed that the Mahāyāna Prajñāpāramitā teachings were first developed by the [[Caitika]] subsect of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]]s. They believe that the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' originated amongst the southern Mahāsāṃghika schools of the [[Coastal Andhra|Āndhra]] region, along the [[Krishna River|Kṛṣṇa River]].&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. pp. 65-66 "Several scholars have suggested that the Prajnaparamita probably developed among the Mahasamghikas in Southern India, in the Andhra country, on the Krsna River."&lt;/ref&gt; These Mahāsāṃghikas had two famous monasteries near [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amarāvati]] and the [[Dharanikota|Dhānyakataka]], which gave their names to the Pūrvaśaila and Aparaśaila schools.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"/&gt; Each of these schools had a copy of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' in [[Prakrit]].&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Guang Xing also assesses the view of the Buddha given in the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' as being that of the Mahāsāṃghikas.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"/&gt; [[Edward Conze]] estimates that this sūtra originated around 100 BCE.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"/&gt;

In 2012, Harry Falk and Seishi Karashima published a damaged and partial [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī]] manuscript of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā''.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Falk and Seishi Karashima, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225647/http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/orc/Publications/ARIRIAB/pdf/ARIRIAB-15.pdf A first‐century Prajñāpāramitā manuscript from Gandhāra&amp;nbsp;— parivarta 1 (Texts from the Split Collection 1)]. Annual Report of the International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University XV (2012), 19-61.&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to ca. 75 CE, making it one of the oldest Buddhist texts in existence. It is very similar to the first Chinese translation of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'' by [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]] (ca. 179 CE) whose source text is assumed to be in the [[Gāndhārī language]];Lokakṣema's translation is also the first extant translation of the Prajñāpāramitā genre into a non-Indic language. Comparison with the standard Sanskrit text shows that it is also likely to be a translation from Gāndhāri as it expands on many phrases and provides glosses for words that are not present in the Gāndhārī. This points to the text being composed in Gāndhārī, the language of [[Gandhara]] (the region now called the Northwest Frontier of Pakistan, including [[Peshawar]], [[Taxila]] and [[Swat Valley]]). The "Split" manuscript is evidently a copy of an earlier text, confirming that the text may date before the first century of the common era.


====''Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā''====
In contrast to western scholarship, Japanese scholars have traditionally considered the ''[[Diamond Sutra|Diamond Sūtra]]'' (''Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'') to be from a very early date in the development of Prajñāpāramitā literature.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 1989 p.42"&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: the Doctrinal Foundations''. London, UK: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-02537-0}}. p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The usual reason for this relative chronology which places the ''Vajracchedikā'' earlier is not its date of translation, but rather a comparison of the contents and themes.&lt;ref&gt;Schopen, Gregory. ''Figments and Fragments of Mahāyāna Buddhism in India.'' 2005. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Some western scholars also believe that the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' was adapted from the earlier ''Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra''.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 1989 p.42" /&gt;

Examining the language and phrases used in both the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'' and the ''Vajracchedikā'', [[Gregory Schopen]] also sees the ''Vajracchedikā'' as being earlier than the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā''.&lt;ref name="Schopen, Gregory 2005. pp. 31-32"&gt;Schopen, Gregory. ''Figments and Fragments of Mahāyāna Buddhism in India.'' 2005. pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; This view is taken in part by examining parallels between the two works, in which the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'' seems to represent the later or more developed position.&lt;ref name="Schopen, Gregory 2005. pp. 31-32"/&gt; According to Schopen, these works also show a shift in emphasis from an oral tradition (''Vajracchedikā'') to a written tradition (''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'').&lt;ref name="Schopen, Gregory 2005. pp. 31-32"/&gt;

===Overview of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras===
[[File:Arapacana manjusri - AP State archaeological museum (1).jpg|thumb|Arapacana manjusri with prajnaparamita in his right hand. Statue belongs to 18 CAD, Tibet. Currently at YSR state archaeological museum|349x349px]]
An Indian commentary on the ''[[Mahāyāna-samgraha|Mahāyānasaṃgraha]]'', entitled ''Vivṛtaguhyārthapiṇḍavyākhyā'', gives a classification of teachings according to the capabilities of the audience:
{{quote|[A]ccording to disciples' grades, the Dharma is [classified as] inferior and superior. For example, the inferior was taught to the merchants [[Trapusa and Bahalika|Trapuṣa and Ballika]] because they were ordinary men; the middle was taught to the group of five because they were at the stage of saints; the eightfold ''Prajñāpāramitās'' were taught to bodhisattvas, and [the ''Prajñāpāramitās''] are superior in eliminating conceptually imagined forms. The eightfold [''Prajñāpāramitās''] are the teachings of the Prajñāpāramitā as follows: the ''Triśatikā'', ''Pañcaśatikā'', ''Saptaśatikā'', ''Sārdhadvisāhasrikā'', ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'', ''Aṣṭadaśasāhasrikā'', ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā'', and ''Śatasāhasrikā''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre. ''Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism.'' 2007. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The titles of these eight Prajñāpāramitā texts are given according to their length. The texts may have other Sanskrit titles as well, or different variations which may be more descriptive. The lengths specified by the titles are given below.

# ''Triśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 300 lines, alternatively known as the ''[[Diamond Sutra|Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]'' (''Diamond Sūtra'')
# ''Pañcaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 500 lines
# ''Saptaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 700 lines, the bodhisattva [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]]'s exposition of Prajñāpāramitā
# ''Sārdhadvisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 2500 lines, from the questions of Suvikrāntavikrāmin Bodhisattva
# ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 8000 lines
# ''Aṣṭadaśasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 18,000 lines
# ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 25,000 lines, alternatively known as the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]''{{citation needed|reason=It is unclear whether the 25,000-line sutra or the 100,000-line sutra is alternatively referred to as the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|date=May 2015}}
# ''Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 100,000 lines, alternatively known as the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]''{{citation needed|reason=It is unclear whether the 25,000-line sutra or the 100,000-line sutra is alternatively referred to as the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|date=May 2015}}

According to Joseph Walser, there is evidence that the ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (25,000 lines) and the ''Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (100,000 lines) have a connection with the [[Dharmaguptaka]] sect, while the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (8000 lines) does not.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' 2008. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these, there are also other Prajñāpāramitā sūtras such as the ''[[Heart Sutra]]'' (''Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya''), which exists in a shorter and longer versions. Regarding the shorter texts, Edward Conze writes, "Two of these, the ''Diamond Sūtra'' and the ''Heart Sūtra'' are in a class by themselves and deservedly renowned throughout the world of Northern Buddhism. Both have been translated into many languages and have often been commented upon.".&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. ''The Short Prajñāpāramitā Texts.'' 1973. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider the Diamond Sutra to be much earlier than Conze does.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahāyāna Buddhism: the Doctrinal Foundations. London, UK: Routledge. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Jan Nattier argues the Heart Sutra to be an apocryphal text composed in China from extracts of the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā and other texts ca 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Nattier. 1992. The Heart Sūtra : a Chinese apocryphal text? Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies. Vol. 15 (2), p.153-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Red Pine, however, does not support Nattiers argument and believes the Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra to be of Indian origin.&lt;ref&gt;"The Heart Sutra Translation and Commentary", 2004. p.22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tantra|Tāntric]] versions of the Prajñāpāramitā literature were produced from the year 500 CE on and include sutras such as the Adhyardhaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā (150 lines). Additionally, Prajñāpāramitā [[Terma (religion)|terma]] teachings are held by some [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] to have been conferred upon [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] by the [[Nagaraja|Nāgarāja]] "King of the [[Nāga]]s", who had been guarding them at the bottom of the sea.

===Commentaries and translations===
There are various Indian and later Chinese commentaries on the Prajñāpāramitā sutras, some of the most influential commentaries include:

*''[[Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa]]'' (大智度論, T no. 1509) a massive and encyclopedic text translated into Chinese by the Buddhist scholar [[Kumarajiva]] (344–413 CE). It is a commentary on the ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā''. This text claims to be from the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]] (c. 2nd century) in the [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]], but various scholars such as [[Etienne Lamotte]] have questioned this attribution. This work was translated by Lamotte as ''Le Traité de la Grande Vertu de Sagesse'' and into English from the French by Gelongma Karma Migme Chodron.&lt;ref&gt;Lamotte, Etienne; Gelongma Karma Migme Chodron. THE TREATISE ON THE GREAT VIRTUE OF WISDOM OF NĀGĀRJUNA (MAHĀPRAJÑĀPĀRAMITĀŚĀSTRA) VOL. I CHAPTERS I – XV COMPOSED BY THE BODHISATTVE NĀGĀRJUNA AND TRANSLATED BY THE TRIPIṬAKADHARMĀCĀRYA KUMĀRAJIVA OF THE LAND OF KOUTCHA UNDER THE LATER TS’IN&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Abhisamayalamkara|Abhisamayālaṅkāra]]'' (''Ornament of clear realization''), the central ''Prajñāpāramitā'' shastra in the Tibetan tradition. It is traditionally attributed as a revelation from the Bodhisattva [[Maitreya]] to the scholar [[Asanga]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 4th century C.E.), known as a master of the [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] school. The Indian commentary on this text by [[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribadra]], the [[Abhisamayalankaraloka]], has also been influential on later Tibetan texts.
*''Śatasāhasrikā-pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikāṣṭādaśasāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā-bṛhaṭṭīkā'', often attributed to [[Vasubandhu]] (4th century).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Brunnhölzl "Prajñāpāramitā, Indian “gzhan ston pas“, And the Beginning of Tibetan gzhan stong" (2011) 197p. https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/wstb/wstb.cgi?ID=78&amp;show_description=1&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Satasahasrika-paramita-brhattika'', attributed to [[Damstrásena]].
*[[Dignaga]]'s ''Prajnaparamitarthasamgraha-karika''.
*[[Ratnākaraśānti]]'s ''Prajñāpāramitopadeśa''.

The sutras were first brought to [[Tibet]] in the reign of [[Trisong Detsen]] (742-796) by scholars [[Jinamitra]] and [[Silendrabodhi]] and the translator Yeshe De.&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2011, page 42"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl; Gone Beyond: The Prajnaparamita Sutras The Ornament Of Clear Realization And Its Commentaries In The Tibetan Kagyu Tradition (Tsadra) 2011, page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prajñāpāramitā in Central Asia===
{{see also|Buddhism in Central Asia}}

By the middle of the 3rd century CE, it appears that some Prajñāpāramitā texts were known in [[Central Asia]], as reported by the Chinese monk Zhu Shixing, who brought back a manuscript of the ''Prajñāpāramitā'' of 25,000 lines:&lt;ref&gt;Heirman, Ann. Bumbacher, Stephan Peter. ''The Spread of Buddhism.'' 2007. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When in 260 AD, the Chinese monk Zhu Shixing chose to go to [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] in an attempt to find original Sanskrit ''sūtras'', he succeeded in locating the Sanskrit ''Prajñāpāramitā'' in 25,000 verses, and tried to send it to China. In Khotan, however, there were numerous [[Hinayana|Hīnayānists]] who attempted to prevent it because they regarded the text as [[heterodox]]. Eventually, Zhu Shixing stayed in Khotan, but sent the manuscript to [[Luoyang]] where it was translated by a Khotanese monk named Mokṣala. In 296, the Khotanese monk Gītamitra came to [[Chang'an]] with another copy of the same text.}}

===China===
In China, there was extensive translations of many Prajñāpāramitā texts beginning in the second century CE, main translators include: [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]] (支婁迦讖), Zhī Qīan (支謙), [[Dharmarakṣa]] (竺法護), Mokṣala (無叉羅), [[Kumārajīva]] (鳩摩羅什, 408 CE), [[Xuánzàng]] (玄奘), Făxián (法賢) and [[Dānapāla]] (施護).&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, M. B.. (2012). Chiasmus in the early Prajñāpāramitā : literary parallelism connecting criticism &amp; hermeneutics in an early Mahāyāna sūtra. (Thesis). Page 41. University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR. Retrieved from https://dx.doi.org/10.5353/th_b4775259&lt;/ref&gt; These translations were very influential in the development of [[East Asian Mādhyamaka]] and on [[Chinese Buddhism]].

[[Xuanzang]] (fl. c. 602–664) was a Chinese scholar who traveled to India and returned to China with three copies of the ''Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' which he had secured from his extensive travels.&lt;ref name="Wriggins, Sally Hovey 2004 p.206"&gt;Wriggins, Sally Hovey (2004). ''The Silk Road Journey with Xuanzang''. Boulder, Colorado: WestviewPress. {{ISBN|0-8133-6599-6}}. p.206&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang, with a team of disciple translators, commenced translating the voluminous work in 660 CE using the three versions to ensure the integrity of the source documentation.&lt;ref name="Wriggins, Sally Hovey 2004 p.206"/&gt; Xuanzang was being encouraged by a number of the disciple translators to render an abridged version. After a suite of dreams quickened his decision, Xuanzang determined to render an unabridged, complete volume, faithful to the original of 600 fascicles.&lt;ref&gt;Wriggins, Sally Hovey (2004). ''The Silk Road Journey with Xuanzang''. Boulder, Colorado: WestviewPress. {{ISBN|0-8133-6599-6}}. p.207&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also later commentaries from Zen Buddhists on the Heart and Diamond sutra and [[Kūkai]]'s commentary (9th century) is the first known Tantric commentary.

==Themes in Prajñāpāramitā sutras==
===Core themes===
[[Image:Rabjor or Subhuti.jpg|thumb|280x280px|A Tibetan illustration of [[Subhuti]], a major character in the PP sutras who is proclaimed as the foremost “dweller in non-conflict” (''araṇavihārīnaṃ'') and “of those worthy of offering” (''dakkhiṇeyyānaṃ'').]]

====The Bodhisattva and Prajñāpāramitā====
A key theme of the Prajñāpāramitā sutras is the figure of the [[Bodhisattva]] (literally: awakening-being) which is defined in the 8,000 line PP sutra as:

:"One who trains in all dharmas [phenomena] without obstruction [''asakti, asaktatā''], and also knows all dharmas as they really are."&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 159.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A Bodhisattva is then a being that experiences everything "without attachment" (''asakti'') and sees reality or suchness (''Tathātā'') as it is. The Bodhisattva is the main ideal in [[Mahayana]] (Great Vehicle), which sees the goal of the Buddhist path as becoming a [[Buddha]] for the sake of all sentient beings, not just yourself:

:They make up their minds that ‘one single self we shall tame . . . one single self we shall lead to final Nirvana.’ 
:A Bodhisattva should certainly not in such a way train himself.
:On the contrary, he should train himself thus: ‘My own self I will place in Suchness [the true way of things], and, so that all the world might be helped, 
:I will place all beings into Suchness, and I will lead to Nirvana the whole immeasurable world of beings.’&lt;ref name="huntingtonarchive.org"&gt;Conze, Edward, THE PERFECTION OF WISDOM IN EIGHT THOUSAND LINES &amp; ITS VERSE SUMMARY, http://huntingtonarchive.org/resources/downloads/sutras/02Prajnaparamita/Astasahasrika.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A central quality of the Bodhisattva is their practice of Prajñāpāramitā, a most deep (''gambhīra'') state of knowledge which is an understanding of reality arising from analysis as well as [[meditative]] insight. It is non-conceptual and [[non-dual]] (''advaya'') as well as [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Mahayana Buddhism, the doctrinal foundations, pages 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Literally, the term could be translated as "knowledge gone to the other (shore)",&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 176.&lt;/ref&gt; or transcendental knowledge. The PP sutra in 8000 lines says:

:This is known as the Prajñāpāramitā of the bodhisattvas; not grasping at form, not grasping at sensation, perception, volitions and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further passage in the 8,000 line PP sutra states that Prajñāpāramitā means that a Bodhisattva stands in emptiness ([[shunyata]]) by not standing (''√sthā'') or supporting themselves on any dharma (phenomena), whether conditioned or unconditioned. The dharmas that a Bodhisattva does "not stand" on include standard listings such as: the [[five aggregates]], the sense fields ([[ayatana]]), [[nirvana]], [[Buddhahood]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 149.&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained by stating that Bodhisattvas "wander without a home" (''aniketacārī''); "home" or "abode" meaning signs (''nimitta'', meaning a subjective mental impression) of sensory objects and the afflictions that arise dependent on them. This includes the absence, the "not taking up" (''aparigṛhīta'') of even "correct" mental signs and perceptions such as "form is not self", "I practice Prajñāpāramitā", etc. To be freed of all constructions and signs, to be signless (''animitta'') is to be empty of them and this is to stand in Prajñāpāramitā.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 180-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The PP sutras state that all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the past have practiced Prajñāpāramitā. Prajñāpāramitā is also associated with ''Sarvajñata'' (all-knowledge) in the PP sutras, a quality of the mind of a Buddha which knows the nature of all dharmas.

[[Image:Gandhara, rilievo col buddha shakyamuni che medita nella grotta indrashala e il buddha dipankara, II-III secolo.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Gandharan depiction of the Bodhisattva (the future Buddha [[Shakyamuni]]) prostrating at the feet of the past Buddha [[Dipankara]].]]

According to Karl Brunnholzl, Prajñāpāramitā means that "all phenomena from form up through omniscience being utterly devoid of any intrinsic characteristics or nature of their own."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl; Gone Beyond: The Prajnaparamita Sutras The Ornament Of Clear Realization And Its Commentaries In The Tibetan Kagyu Tradition (Tsadra) 2011, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "such omniscient wisdom is always nonconceptual and free from reference points since it is the constant and panoramic awareness of the nature of all phenomena and does not involve any shift between meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl; Gone Beyond: The Prajnaparamita Sutras The Ornament Of Clear Realization And Its Commentaries In The Tibetan Kagyu Tradition (Tsadra) 2011, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Conze]] outlined several psychological qualities of a Bodhisattva's practice of Prajñāpāramitā:&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward; The Ontology of the Prajnaparamita, Philosophy East and West Vol.3 (1953) PP.117-129, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;

*Non-apprehension (''anupalabdhi'')
*No settling down or "non-attachment" (''anabhinivesa'')
*No attainment (''aprapti''). No person can "have," or "possess," or "acquire," or "gain" any dharma.
*Non-reliance on any dharma, being unsupported, not leaning on any dharma.
*"Finally, one may say that the attitude of the perfected sage is one of non-assertion."

====Other Bodhisattva qualities====
The PP sutras also teach of the importance of the other [[paramitas]] (perfections) for the Bodhisattva such as [[Ksanti]] (patience): "Without resort to this patience (kṣānti) they [bodhisattvas] cannot reach their respective goals".&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 124.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another quality of the Bodhisattva is their freedom from fear (''na √tras'') in the face of the seemingly shocking doctrine of the emptiness of all dharmas which includes their own existence. A good friend (''kalyanamitra'') is useful in the path to fearlessness. Bodhisattvas also have no pride or self-conception (''na manyeta'') of their own stature as Bodhisattvas.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 139-40.&lt;/ref&gt; These are important features of the mind of a bodhisattva, called [[bodhicitta]]. The PP sutras also mention that bodhicitta is a middle way, it is neither apprehended as existent (''astitā'') or non-existent (''nāstitā'') and it is "immutable" (''avikāra'') and "free from conceptualization" (''avikalpa'').&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bodhisattva is said to generate "great compassion" (''maha-[[karuṇā]]'') for all beings on their path to liberation and yet also maintain a sense of equanimity ([[upekṣā]]) and distance from them through their understanding of emptiness, due to which, the Bodhisattva knows that even after bringing countless beings to nirvana, "no living being whatsoever has been brought to nirvana."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Bodhisattvas]] and [[Mahāsattva]]s are also willing to give up all of their meritorious deeds for sentient beings and develop skillful means ([[upaya]]) in order to help abandon false views and teach them the Dharma. The practice of Prajñāpāramitā allows a Bodhisattva to become: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"a saviour of the helpless, a defender of the defenceless, a refuge to those without refuge, a place to rest to those without resting place, the final relief of those who are without it, an island to those without one, a light to the blind, a guide to the guideless, a resort to those without one and....guide to the path those who have lost it, and you shall become a support to those who are without support."&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Tathātā====
[[Image:The Buddha's Descent from Heaven at Samkashya (top; a), The Story of the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita (middle; b), The Buddha Preaching to the Assembled Gods (bottom; c), Three Folios from LACMA M.86.345.11a-c (4 of 4).jpg|thumb|280x280px|Illustration of Bodhisattva ''Sadāprarudita'' (Ever weeping), a character in the 8000 line PP sutra [[Avadana]] section, which is used by the Buddha as an exemplar of those who seek Prajñāpāramitā.]]

''Tathātā'' (Suchness or Thusness) and the related term ''Dharmatā'' (the nature of Dharma), and [[Tathāgata]] are also important terms of the PP texts. To practice Prajñāpāramitā means to practice in accord with 'the nature of Dharma' and to see the Tathāgata (i.e. the Buddha). As the 8000 line PP sutra states, these terms are generally used equivalently: "As the suchness (''tathatā'') of dharmas is immovable (''acalitā''), and the suchness (''tathatā'') of dharmas is the ''Tathāgata''.".&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tathāgata is said in the 8000 line PP sutra to "neither come nor go". Furthermore, the 8000 line PP sutra includes a list of synonyms associated with Tathāgata as also being "beyond coming and going", these include: 1. Suchness (''tathatā''); 2. Unarisen (''anutpāda''); 3. Reality limit (''bhūtakoṭi''); 4. Śūnyatā; 5. Division (''yathāvatta''); 6. Detachment (''virāga''); 7. Cessation (''nirodha''); 8. Space element (''ākāśadhātu''). The sutra then states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from these dharmas, there is no Tathāgata. The suchness of these dharmas, and the suchness of the Tathāgatas, is all one single suchness (''ekaivaiṣā tathatā''), not two, not divided (''dvaidhīkāraḥ''). … beyond all classification (''gaṇanāvyativṛttā''), due to non-existence (''asattvāt'').&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Suchness then does not come or go because like the other terms, it is not a real entity (''bhūta'', ''svabhāva''), but merely appears conceptually through [[dependent origination]], like a dream or an illusion. 

[[Edward Conze]] lists six ways in which the ontological status of dharmas is considered by the Prajñāpāramitā:&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward; The Ontology of the Prajnaparamita, Philosophy East and West Vol.3 (1953) PP.117-129, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;

#Dharmas are non-existent because they have no own-being ([[svabhava]]).
#Dharmas have a purely nominal existence. They are mere words, a matter of conventional expression.
#Dharmas are "without marks, with one mark only, ie., with no mark." A mark (''laksana'') being a distinctive property which separates it from other dharmas.
#Dharmas are isolated (''vivikta''), absolutely isolated (''atyantavivikta'').
#Dharmas have never been produced, never come into existence; they are not really ever brought forth, they are unborn (''ajata'').
#Non-production is illustrated by a number of similes, i.e., dreams, magical illusions, echoes, reflected images, mirages, and space.

It is through seeing this Tathātā that one is said to have a vision of the Buddha (the Tathāgata), seeing this is called seeing the Buddha's [[Dharmakaya]] (Dharma body) which is a not his physical body, but none other than the true nature of dharmas.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Negation and Emptiness====
Most modern Buddhist scholars such as [[Etienne Lamotte|Lamotte]], Conze and [[Yin Shun]] have seen [[Śūnyatā]] (emptiness, voidness, hollowness) as ''the'' central theme of the PP sutras.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Conze]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now the principal teaching of Prajñāpāramitā with regard to own-being that it is "empty." The Sanskrit term is ''svabhāva-śūnya''. This is a ''[[tatpuruṣa]]'' compound (one in which the last member is qualified by the first without losing its grammatical independence), in which [[svabhava]] may have the sense of any oblique case. The [[Mahayana]] understands it to mean that dharmas are empty of any own-being, i.e.,that they are not ultimate facts in their own right, but merely imagined and falsely discriminated, for each and every one of them is dependent on something other than itself. From a slightly different angle this means that dharmas, when viewed with perfected [[gnosis]], reveal an own-being which is identical with emptiness, i.e in their own-being they are empty.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward; The Ontology of the Prajnaparamita, Philosophy East and West Vol.3 (1953) PP.117-129, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The PP sutras commonly use [[apophasis|apophatic]] statements to express the nature of reality as seen by Prajñāpāramitā. A common trope in the Prajñāpāramitā sutras is the negation of a previous statement in the form 'A is not A, therefore it is A', or more often negating only a part of the statement as in, “XY is a Y-less XY”.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, M. B.. (2012). Chiasmus in the early Prajñāpāramitā : literary parallelism connecting criticism &amp; hermeneutics in an early Mahāyāna sūtra. (Thesis). Page 171. University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR. Retrieved from https://dx.doi.org/10.5353/th_b4775259&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese Buddhologist, Hajime Nakamura, calls this negation the 'logic of not' (''na prthak'').&lt;ref&gt;Nagatomo, Shigenori (2000). The Logic of the Diamond Sutra: A is not A, therefore it is A; Asian Philosophy 10 (3), 217–244&lt;/ref&gt; An example from the [[Diamond sutra]] of this use of negation is:

:As far as ‘all dharmas’ are concerned, Subhuti, all of them are dharma-less. That is why they are called ‘all dharmas.’&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Harrison, Paul. Vajracchedika Prajñaparamita Diamond Cutting Transcendent Wisdom&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale behind this form is the juxtaposition of conventional truth with ultimate truth as taught in the Buddhist [[two truths doctrine]]. The negation of conventional truth is supposed to expound the ultimate truth of the emptiness ([[Śūnyatā]]) of all reality - the idea that nothing has an ontological essence and all things are merely conceptual, without substance. 

The PP sutras state that dharmas should not be conceptualized either as existent, nor as non existent, and use negation to highlight this: "in the way in which dharmas exist (''saṃvidyante''), just so do they not exist (''asaṃvidyante'')".&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Māya====
{{Main article|Maya_(religion)#Buddhism}}
The PP sutras commonly state that all dharmas (phenomena), are in some way like an [[illusion]] (''[[Maya_(religion)#Buddhism|māya]]''), like a [[dream]] (''svapna'') and like a [[mirage]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Mahayana Buddhism, the doctrinal foundations, pages 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' states: 

:"A shooting star, a clouding of the sight, a lamp, An illusion, a drop of dew, a bubble, A dream, a lightning’s flash, a thunder cloud— This is the way one should see the conditioned."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Paul (trans.) Vajracchedika Prajñaparamita Diamond Cutting Transcendent Wisdom, https://hyanniszendo.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/diamondsutra_lettersize1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the highest Buddhist goals like [[Buddhahood]] and [[Nirvana]] are to be seen in this way, thus the highest wisdom or prajña is a type of spiritual knowledge which sees all things as illusory. As Subhuti in the 8000 line PP sutra states:

:"Even if perchance there could be anything more distinguished, of that also I would say that it is like an illusion, like a dream. For not two different things are illusions and Nirvāṇa, are dreams and Nirvāṇa."&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

This is connected to the impermanence and insubstantial nature of dharmas. The PP sutras give the simile of a magician (''māyākāra'': 'illusion-maker') who, when seemingly killing his illusory persons by cutting off their heads, really kills nobody and compare it to the bringing of beings to awakening (by 'cutting off' the conceptualization of self view; Skt: ''ātmadṛṣṭi chindati'') and the fact that this is also ultimately like an illusion, because their aggregates "are neither bound nor released".&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The illusion then, is the conceptualization and mental fabrication of dharmas as existing or not existing, as arising or not arising. Prajñāpāramitā sees through this illusion, being empty of concepts and fabrications. 

Perceiving dharmas and beings like an illusion (''māyādharmatām'') is termed the "great armor" (''mahāsaṃnaha'') of the Bodhisattva, who is also termed the 'illusory man' (''māyāpuruṣa'').&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 165-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later additions===
According to Paul Williams, another major theme of the PP sutras is "the phenomenon of laudatory self reference – the lengthy praise of the sutra itself, the immense merits to be obtained from treating even a verse of it with reverence, and the nasty penalties which will accrue in accordance with [[karma]] to those who denigrate the scripture."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Mahayana Buddhism, the doctrinal foundations, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Edward Conze]], the PP sutras added much new doctrinal material in the later layers and the larger texts. Conze lists the later accretions as:&lt;ref name="huntingtonarchive.org"/&gt;

#Increasing sectarianism, with all the rancor, invective and polemics that that implies
#Increasing scholasticism and the insertion of longer and longer Abhidharma lists
#Growing stress on skill in means, and on its subsidiaries such as the Bodhisattva’s Vow and the four means of conversion, and its logical sequences, such as the distinction between provisional and ultimate truth
#A growing concern with the Buddhist of faith, with its celestial Buddhas and Bodhisattva and their Buddha-fields;
#A tendency towards verbosity, repetitiveness and overelaboration
#Lamentations over the decline of the Dharma
#Expositions of the hidden meaning which become the more frequent the more the original meaning becomes obscured
#Any reference to the Dharma body of the Buddha as anything different from a term for the collection of his teachings
#A more and more detailed doctrine of the graded stages (bhumi) of a Bodhisattva’s career.

==Prajñāpāramitā in visual art==
The Prajnaparamita is often personified as a ''bodhisattvadevi'' (female bodhisattva). Artifacts from [[Nalanda]] depict the Prajnaparamita personified as a deity. The depiction of Prajnaparamita as a Yidam deity can also be found in ancient Java and Cambodian art.

===Prajñāpāramitā in Ancient Indonesia===
[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Front.JPG|thumb|Prajñāpāramitā statue from East Java, Indonesia.|551x551px]]
{{main article|Prajnaparamita of Java}}
[[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] took root in ancient [[Java]] [[Sailendra]] court in the 8th century CE. The Mahayana reverence of female buddhist deity started with the cult of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] enshrined in the 8th century [[Kalasan]] temple in Central Java. Some of Prajnaparamita's important functions and attributes can be traced to those of the goddess Tara. Tara and Prajnaparamita are both referred to as mothers of all Buddhas, since Buddhas are born from wisdom. The Sailendra dynasty was also the ruling family of [[Srivijaya]] in Sumatra. During the reign of the third Pala king Devapala (815-854) in India, Srivijaya Maharaja [[Balaputra]] of Sailendras also constructed one of Nalanda’s main monasteries in India itself. Thereafter manuscript editions of the ''Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra'' circulating in Sumatra and Java instigated the cult of the Goddess of Transcendent Wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianartnewspaper.com/article/early-buddhist-manuscript-painting%3A-the-palm-leaf-tradition Asian Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312213139/http://www.asianartnewspaper.com/article/early-buddhist-manuscript-painting%3A-the-palm-leaf-tradition |date=March 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, the tantric buddhism gained royal patronage of king [[Kertanegara of Singhasari]], and thereafter some of Prajnaparamita statues were produced in the region, such as the Prajnaparamita of Singhasari in East Java and Prajnaparamita of [[Muaro Jambi Regency]], [[Sumatra]]. Both of East Java and Jambi Prajnaparamitas bear resemblance in style as they were produced in same period, however unfortunately Prajnaparamita of Jambi is headless and was discovered in poor condition.

The statue of Prajnaparamita of East Java is probably the most famous depiction of the goddess of transcendental wisdom, and is considered the masterpiece of classical ancient Java Hindu-Buddhist art in Indonesia. It was discovered in the Cungkup Putri ruins near Singhasari temple, [[Malang]], [[East Java]]. Today the beautiful and serene statue is displayed on 2nd floor Gedung Arca, [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].

[[File:Roman de la poire heart metaphor.jpg|thumb|Illustration from fol. 41 of Ms. fr. 2186, the kneeling man is an allegory of ''Doux Regard'' ("sweet gaze") handing the damsel the lover's heart. This is the earliest known depiction of the [[human heart]] in a [[heart (metaphor)|metaphorical context]] signifying "romantic love", which over the next two centuries would give rise to the now-familiar [[heart symbol]].]]

'''''Le roman de la poire''''' (''Li romanz de la poire'', "Romance of the Pear") is a [[Old French|medieval French]] (13th century) [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] by a certain Thibaut.
It is influenced by the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'' in describing the [[falling in love|onset of love]] in terms of allegory and in its frequent use of the first person. The title is derived from a central scene where the damsel shares a pear which she has peeled with her teeth with the lover.

The text is preserved in [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|BnF]] Ms. fr. 2186, an illuminated manuscript dated to the 1250s. It was illustrated in the workshop of the ''maître de Bari'' (so named after a [[gradual]] now at [[Basilica di San Nicola|San Nicola]], [[Bari]]), which is known to have been active in Paris during the 1250s. The text itself would on internal evidence be dated to between about 1230 and 1285, so that it is rather certain that the manuscript is the one used for the original presentation of the text and that the text's composition dates to the mid 13th century (Tesnière 1987). 
The manuscript extends to 83 folia, measuring 205 x 135 mm. It includes nine full-page miniatures and 18 historiated initials.
The full-page miniatures depict famous lovers from literature, including [[Tristan and Isolde]], [[Cliges and Fenice]], [[Pyramus and Thisbe]] and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].

The work presumably enjoyed limited success, and its reception did not extend beyond the early 14th century. Two copies of the original text survive, dated to the late 13th or early 14th century (Ms. fr. 12786 and Ms. fr. 24431). A fragment of a further copy from about the same time was published in 1982 by Richard O'Gorman.

'''Sacred''' is dedicated or set apart for the service or worship of a [[deity]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sacred&lt;/ref&gt; or considered worthy of spiritual [[respect]] or devotion; or inspiring [[awe]] or [[Reverence (emotion)|reverence]] among believers. The property is often ascribed to objects (a "sacred artifact" that is [[Veneration|venerated]] and [[Blessing|blessed]]), or places ("sacred ground").

French [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] considered the [[dichotomy]] between the sacred and the [[profanum|profane]] to be the central characteristic of [[religion]]: "religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to ''sacred things'', that is to say, things set apart and forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim 1915, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In Durkheim's theory, the sacred represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or [[totems]]. The profane, on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns.

Although there are similarities between the terms "sacred" and "holy" and they are sometimes used interchangeably, there are subtle differences.&lt;ref name=difference&gt;[http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-sacred-and-holy/ "Difference Between Sacred and Holy", DifferenceBetween.com, September 26, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; "Holiness" is generally the term used in relation to persons and relationship, while "sacredness" is used in relation to objects, places, or happenings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YGX6oKlw24UC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=holiness+vs+sacredness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LSBrWEffCh&amp;sig=3Bjyli7MdxC5cMQ0L544nETGNTk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixsdmn3LjQAhVq44MKHSCVC8k4FBDoAQg7MAs#v=onepage&amp;q=holiness%20vs%20sacredness&amp;f=false McCann, Catherine. ''New Paths Toward the Sacred Thus'', Paulist Press, 2008] {{ISBN|9780809145515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a saint may be considered as holy, but he is not viewed as sacred.&lt;ref name=difference/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "sacred" descends from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:sacer|sacer]]'', that is consecrated, or dedicated&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NmogAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA889&amp;lpg=PA889&amp;dq=holiness+vs+sacredness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZSLIJdyPqp&amp;sig=zO322whbPNR1CiW-VdfEIncC6ss&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZv5aJ0LjQAhUB7IMKHQcJBcw4ChDoAQg5MAc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Sacred", ''A Dictionary of the English Language'' (James Stormonth, Philip Henry Phelp, eds.), Blackwood &amp; sons, 1895, p.883]&lt;/ref&gt; to the gods or anything in their power, and to ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdos]]'' and ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sanctum]]'', set apart.

==Distinguished from "Holy"==
{{main article|Hallow}}
Although there are similarities between the terms "sacred" and "holy" and they are sometimes used interchangeably, there are subtle differences.&lt;ref name=difference&gt;[http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-sacred-and-holy/ "Difference Between Sacred and Holy", DifferenceBetween.com, September 26, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; "Holiness" is generally the term used in relation to persons and relationship, while "sacredness" is used in relation to objects, places, or happenings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YGX6oKlw24UC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=holiness+vs+sacredness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LSBrWEffCh&amp;sig=3Bjyli7MdxC5cMQ0L544nETGNTk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixsdmn3LjQAhVq44MKHSCVC8k4FBDoAQg7MAs#v=onepage&amp;q=holiness%20vs%20sacredness&amp;f=false McCann, Catherine. ''New Paths Toward the Sacred Thus'', Paulist Press, 2008] {{ISBN|9780809145515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a saint may be considered as holy, but he is not viewed as sacred. However, there are things that are both holy and sacred such as the holy bible.&lt;ref name=difference/&gt;

The English word "holy" dates back to at least the 11th century with the [[Old English]] word ''[[hālig]]'', an adjective derived from ''hāl'' meaning "whole" and used to mean "uninjured, sound, healthy, entire, complete". The Scottish ''hale'' ("health, happiness and wholeness") is the most complete modern form of this Old English root. The word "holy" in its modern form appears in [[Wycliffe's Bible]] of 1382. In non-specialist contexts, the term "holy" is used in a more general way, to refer to someone or something that is associated with a [[Divine grace|divine power]], such as [[Holy water|water]] used for [[baptism]].

While both words denote something or someone set apart to the worship of God and therefore worthy of respect and in some cases veneration, "holy" (the stronger word) implies an inherent or essential character.&lt;ref&gt;"Sacred", ''
Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 5th edition, p.875&lt;/ref&gt; Holiness originates in God and is communicated to things, places, times, and persons engaged in His Service. Thus Aquinas Thomas defines "holiness" as that virtue by which a man's mind applies itself and all its acts to God; he ranks it among the infused moral [[Virtue|virtues]], and identifies it with the virtue of religion, but with this difference that, whereas religion is the virtue whereby one offers God due service in the things which pertain to the Divine service, holiness is the virtue by which one makes all one's acts subservient to God. Thus holiness or sanctity is the outcome of sanctification, that Divine act by which God freely justifies a person, and by which He has claimed them for His own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm Pope, Hugh. "Holiness." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 20 November 2016. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hierology===
{{See also|Hierotopy}}
Hierology ([[Greek language|Greek]] ιερος, ''hieros'', "sacred" or "holy", + [[-logy]]) is the study of [[Religious text|sacred literature]] or [[Folklore|lore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Hierology dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/hierology?q=Hierology Oxford Dictionary Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of religions===
{{Main article|History of religions}}
[[Mircea Eliade]] outlines that religion should not be interpreted only as 'belief in deities', but as 'experience of the sacred'. He analyses the dialectic of the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Altizer, Thomas J. J. (1968), ''Mircea Eliade and the Dialectic of the Sacred'', Philadelphia: The Westminster Press. {{ISBN|978-083-7171-96-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sacred is presented in relation to the profane.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Mircea (1987), ''The Sacred and the Profane: The Nature of Religion'', translated by Willard R. Trask. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0156-79201-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between the sacred and the profane is not of opposition, but of complementarity, as the profane is viewed as a [[hierophany]].&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2006), ''Mircea Eliade'', Bucharest: Editura Fundaţiei România de Mâine, p. 35. {{ISBN|973-725-715-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
{{Main article|Sacred–profane dichotomy}}
French [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] considered the [[dichotomy]] between the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] and the [[profanum|profane]] to be the central characteristic of [[religion]]: "religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to ''sacred things'', that is to say, things set apart and forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim 1915, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In Durkheim's theory, the sacred represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or [[totems]]. The profane, on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns. Durkheim explicitly stated that the dichotomy sacred/profane was not equivalent to [[Good and evil|good/evil]]. The sacred could be [[good]] or [[evil]], and the profane could be either as well.&lt;ref&gt;Pals 1996, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==

===Buddhism===
In [[Theravada]] Buddhism one finds the designation of 'noble person' or ''ariyapuggala''  ([[Pali]]). The Buddha described four grades of such person depending on their level of purity. This purity is measured by which of the ten [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetter]]s (''samyojana'') and ''[[Kleśā (Buddhism)|klesha]]'' have been purified and integrated from the [[mindstream]]. These persons are called (in order of increasing sanctity) ''[[Sotāpanna]]'', ''[[Sakadagami]]'', ''[[Anāgāmi]]'' and ''[[Arhat|Arahant]]''.

===Christianity===
{{Attributes of God}}
More traditional [[Christian denominations|denominations]], such as the [[Anglican]], [[Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], and [[Methodist]] Churches, believe in [[Holy Sacraments]] that the clergy perform, such as [[Holy Communion]] and [[Holy Baptism]], as well as strong belief in the [[Four marks of the church|Holy Catholic Church]], [[Bible|Holy Scripture]], [[Holy Trinity]], and the [[Covenant (biblical)|Holy Covenant]]. They also believe that angels and saints are called to holiness.

====Catholicism====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Purgatory]] --&gt;
{{See also|Sanctum sanctorum}}
[[File:Persian Cock.jpg|thumb|right|Vatican Persian Cock – A 1919 print of a fabric square of a Persian [[rooster|cock]] or a Persian bird design belonging to the Vatican ([[Holy See]]) in Rome dating to 600 CE. Notice the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] denoting the status of being holy or sacred.]]
[[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] has inherited much of the Jewish vision of the world in terms of holiness, with certain behaviour appropriate to certain places and times. The calendar gives shape to Catholic practice, which tends to focus on the [[Eucharist]], in which the [[Real Presence]] of [[Christ]] is manifested. [[feast day|Holy days]], celebrating events of the life of Christ and the lives of [[Saint#Catholic Church|Catholic saints]] officially recognized as holy, are celebrated throughout the year.

Many features of the Jewish temple (although now seen as having Christian significance) are imitated in [[Church (building)|churches]], such as the [[altar]], bread, lamp, [[incense]], [[baptismal font|font]], etc., to emphasise the extreme holiness of the Eucharistic elements, which are reserved in a [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]]. In extension of this focus on the Sacrament as holy, many objects in Catholicism are also considered holy. They are called [[sacramentals]] and are usually blessed by a priest. Such items include [[rosary|rosaries]], [[crucifix]]es, medals, and statues and icons of [[Jesus]], [[angel]]s and [[saint]]s (e.g. [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]). While Catholics believe that holy places and objects (i.e., objects dedicated to God for sacred use) should be respected and not put to profane use, the [[Catholic Church]] condemns worshiping the object itself, as any worship given to something other than God is considered [[idolatry]].

People in a state of sanctifying [[Actual grace|grace]] are also considered holy in Catholicism. A central notion of Catholicism as articulated in contemporary theology is the "[personal] call to holiness," considered to be a [[vocation]] shared by every Christian believer. Profound personal holiness has traditionally also been seen as a focus for the kind of contagious holiness primarily associated with the Sacrament. So the [[communion of saints]] in Catholicism is not only the acclamation of their [[piety]] or [[morality]], but also reverence for the tangible holiness that flows from their proximity to the divine. Hence the places where saints lived, died, performed miracles, or received visions frequently become sites of [[pilgrimage]], and notable objects surviving a saint (including the body or parts of it) are considered [[relics]]. The holiness of such places or objects, resulting from contact with a deeply holy person, is often connected with the miraculous long after the death of the saint.

[[Sanctus]] (Latin for "holy") is the name of an important hymn of Christian liturgy. The [[Trisagion]] ('Thrice Holy') is a standard hymn of the Divine Liturgy of the Eastern Churches.

====Lutheranism====
[[File:Chancel of Trinity Lutheran Church on Easter Sunday.jpeg|thumb|On [[Easter Sunday]], the [[chancel]] of this Lutheran church is adorned with [[Lilium longiflorum|Easter lilies]], a symbol of the [[resurrection of Christ]], and white [[parament]]s, the liturgical colour of [[Eastertide]].]]
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
The early Protestant Reformers, who were often scholars of Ancient Greek and also borrowed from Jewish scholarship, recognized that holiness is an [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attribute]] of [[God]], and holiness is always part of the [[presence of God]]. Yet they also recognized that "practical holiness" was the evidence of the presence of God in the converted believer. [[Martin Luther]] viewed God's [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] (and therefore God's holiness), as an invasion of the life. Actions that demonstrated holiness would spring up, not premeditated, as believers focused more and more on their relationship with Christ. This was the life of [[faith]], according to Luther; a life in which one recognizes that the sin inherent in human nature never departs, yet grace invades each human spirit and draws each person after Christ.

====Reformed====
[[John Calvin|Calvin]], on the other hand, formulated a practical system of holiness that even tied in with culture and social [[justice]]. All unholy actions, Calvin reasoned, resulted in [[suffering]]. Thus he proved out to the city fathers of [[Geneva]] that dancing and other social vices always ended with the wealthy oppressing the poor. A holy life, in his outlook, was pietistic and simple, a life that shunned extravagance, excess, and vanity. On a personal level, Calvin believed that suffering would be a manifestation of taking on the [[Cross of Christ]], but suffering was also part of the process of holiness. He expected that all Christians would suffer in this life, not as punishment, but rather as participation in union with Christ, who suffered for them. And yet, socially, Calvin argued that a holy society would end up as a gentle, kindly society (except to criminals) where the poor would be protected from the abuses of the wealthy, the lawyers, and others who normally preyed upon them.

In [[Methodism]], holiness has acquired the secondary meaning of the reshaping of a person through spiritual [[Born again (Christianity)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Methodist Visitor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEAEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA137|year=1876|publisher=Elliot Stock, 62, Paternoster Row, E.C. |page=137|quote="Ye must be born again." Yield to God that He may perform this work in and for you. Admit Him to your heart. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term owes its origin to [[John Wesley]], who stressed "scriptural holiness", as well as [[Christian perfection]].

The [[Holiness movement]] began within [[Methodism]] in the [[United States]], among those who thought the church had lost the zeal and emphasis on personal holiness of Wesley's day. In the latter part of the 19th century revival meetings were held, attended by thousands. In [[Vineland, New Jersey|Vineland, N.J]] in 1867 a camp meeting was begun and the National Holiness Camp Meeting Association went on to establish many holiness [[camp meeting]]s across the nation. Some adherents to the movement remained within their denominations; others founded new denominations, such as the [[Free Methodist Church]], the [[Church of the Nazarene]], and the [[Church of God (Anderson)]]. Within a generation another movement, the Pentecostal movement was born, drawing heavily from the Holiness movement. Around the middle of the 20th century, the [[Conservative Holiness Movement]], a conservative offshoot of the Holiness movement, was born. The [[Higher Life movement]] appeared in the British Isles during the mid-19th century.

In the contemporary Holiness movement, the idea that holiness is relational is growing. In this thought, the core notion of holiness is [[love]]. Other notions of holiness, such as purity, being set apart, perfection, keeping rules, and total commitment, are seen as contributory notions of holiness. These contributory notions find their ultimate legitimacy when love is at their core ([[Thomas Jay Oord]] and Michael Lodahl).

Commonly recognized outward expressions or "standards" of holiness among more fundamental adherents frequently include applications relative to dress, hair, and appearance:  e.g., short hair on men, uncut hair on women, and prohibitions against shorts, pants on women, make-up and jewelry. Other common injunctions are against places of worldly amusement, mixed swimming, smoking, [[minced oaths]], as well as the eschewing of television and radio.

====Orthodoxy====

===Islam===
Among the [[names of God in the Qur'an]] is القدوس (''Al-Quddus'') : found in {{cite quran|59|23|style=nosup|expand=no}} and {{cite quran|62|1|style=nosup|expand=no}}, the closest English translation is "holy" or "sacred". It shares the [[Q-D-Š|same triliteral Semitic root]] as the Hebrew ''kodesh'' (see below). Another use of the same root is found in the Arabic name for Jerusalem: ''[[al-Quds]]'', "the Holy".

The word حرام ''(ħarām)'', often translated as "prohibited" or "forbidden", is better understood as "sacred" or "sanctuary" in the context of places considered sacred in Islam, ''e.&amp;thinsp;g.'': the ''[[Masjid al-Haram]]'', the Sacred Mosque in [[Mecca]], constituting the immediate precincts of the [[Ka'aba]]; ''[[Haram (site)|al-Haramain]]'' or "the (two) Sanctuaries", a reference to the twin holy cities of Mecca and [[Medina]]; and the ''[[Haram ash-Sharif]]'' or Noble Sanctuary, the precincts of the [[Dome of the Rock]] and [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]].

===Judaism===
{{see also|Q-D-Š|Tzadik|Holy of Holies}}
The Hebrew word קֹדֶשׁ, transliterated as ''qodesh'', has been used in the [[Torah]] to mean set-apartness and separateness as well as holiness and sacredness.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|title="H6944 - qodesh - Strong's Hebrew Lexicon (HNV)."
|author=Blue Letter Bible.
|accessdate=28 Jun 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah describes the [[Kohen|Aaronite priests]] and the [[Levite]]s as being selected by God to perform the Temple services; they, as well, are called "holy." Some{{who|date=September 2011}} consider that the Hebrew noun for "holiness," ''kedushah'' ({{lang-he|קדושה}}), from the adjective ''kodesh'', "holy," has the connotation of "separateness".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

However, holiness is not a single state, but contains a broad spectrum. The [[Mishnah]] lists concentric circles of holiness surrounding the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]: [[Holy of Holies]], Temple Sanctuary, Temple Vestibule, Court of Priests, Court of Israelites, Court of Women, [[Temple Mount]], the walled city of [[Jerusalem]], all the walled cities of Israel, and the borders of the [[Land of Israel]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Distinctions are made as to who and what are permitted in each area.

Likewise, the [[Jewish holidays]] and the [[Shabbat]] are considered to be holy in time; the Torah calls them "holy [days of] gathering". Work is not allowed on those days, and rabbinic tradition lists [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|39 categories of activity]] that are specifically prohibited.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Beyond the intrinsically holy, objects can become sacred through [[consecration]]. Any personal possession may be dedicated to the Temple of God, after which its misappropriation is considered among the gravest of sins. The various [[Korban|sacrifices]] are holy. Those that may be eaten have very specific rules concerning who may eat which of their parts, and time limits on when the consumption must be completed. Most sacrifices contain a part to be consumed by the priests – a portion of the holy to be consumed by God's holy devotees.

The encounter with the holy is seen as eminently desirable, and at the same time fearful and awesome. For the strongest penalties are applied to one who transgresses in this area – one could in theory receive either the death penalty or the heavenly punishment of ''[[kareth]]'', spiritual excision, for mis-stepping in his close approach to God's domain.

'''Salvino Azzopardi''' (21 June 1931 – 6 August 2006), was a Maltese [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Catholic priest|priest]], philosopher at [[Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth]] in [[Pune, India|Pune]], [[India]]. He specialised in [[logic]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], [[mysticism]], and [[metaphilosophy]]. As a philosopher he combined insights from Indian and Western Philosophies. Besides JDV, Pune, India, he has also taught at the Jesuit Philosophate, Kandy, [[Sri Lanka]] and Diocesan Seminary, Gozo, [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;JDV Handbook, Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth, Pune, 1991, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is famous for his new insights on [[mysticism]] and [[metaphilosophy]]. His ideas and insights have influenced many philosophers in India.

==Early childhood==
Salvino, the fifth child of the Legal Procurator Philip Azzopardi and Giuseppina née Borg, and nephew of the servant of God, Eugenio Borg, his mother’s brother, was born on 20 June 1931 at Hamrun, Malta. He had his secondary schooling at the Lyceum and at an early age joined the “Lega”, the [[Hamrun]] Catholic Action “Milites Christi Regis”, where he became a catechist of the young aspirants.

==Early Jesuit life==
In 1947, at the age of sixteen, Salvino joined the Society of Jesus at Naxxar, Malta, following in the footsteps of his elder brother Anton who had joined the Society two years ahead of him. He emitted his first vows in 1949 at Naxxar, and then followed the normal course of studies in the Society: two years literature at Naxxar, three years philosophy at Vals in France, a year’s prefecting the boys at St Aloysius’ College, Malta, and another year at Clongows College, Ireland. Then four years of theology at Heythrop College, Oxon, England, where he was ordained priest on 31 July 1959. Fr Salvino did his Third Year of Novitiate in Florence, Italy, after which, i.e. in 1961, he was sent to the Gregorian University in Rome where in 1963 he took his Doctorate in Philosophy “cum laude”.

==Back to Malta and more==
After all those years of intensive intellectual activity in India, Fr Salvino began to feel his health wane. So in 1990 his Superiors advised him to return to Malta to regain his health. The doctors in Malta sent him to London for a heart
by-pass surgery, after which he had to spend over a year convalescing in Malta. Fr Salvino aspired to go back to India, but could not.&lt;ref&gt;For this section we are grateful to the reflections of his brother, Rev. Fr. Anton Azzopardi, himself a Jesuit, like Salvino.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
From 2001 onwards, Fr Salvino at Loyola House, Naxxar, Malta, carried on with his studies in Sanskrit, Greek and Hebrew. He was also the House historian and put in charge of various small offices. When his health did not permit him to move about freely he stayed in bed and spent time in prayer, listened to classical music and watched DVD films on his computer.
His health grew worse. In 2006 the periodic but frequent severe bouts of stomach and pulmonary attacks made his life miserable. But he never lost his optimism, his cheerful smile and his hearty laugh, nor did he ever refuse to help anyone who asked for his assistance.

On 6 August 2006, the feast of Our Lord the Saviour, his namesake, Fr Salvino, feeling relatively well, accepted an invitation by his niece to lunch at her house. At about 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. he started feeling queer in his chest and hard to breathe. He was rushed back home, and the doctor ordered him straight to hospital. Fr Salvino, in bitter pain and hardly able to breathe, received the last rites and just after 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. he died.&lt;ref&gt;From the Maltese Jesuit Newsletter, Naxxar, Malta, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Azzopardi left Malta for [[Pune, India|Pune]], [[India]] as a missionary in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Reverend Azzophardi was active in India as a Jesuit priest and professor of philosophy. He went there as a missionary and was full-time engaged in training young seminarians to become priests.&lt;/ref&gt;
He belonged to the Maltese Province of the Society of Jesus and was lent to Dumka-Raiganj Province (formerly Santal Region) of the [[Society of Jesus]], [[Jharkhand]], India.

In India, he was primarily involved in teaching philosophy at [[Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth]], [[Pune]]. Then in  1988, due to ill health, he returned to Malta. Later for a brief period of time, he went to [[Sri Lanka]] to start the Jesuit philosophate there. He was recalled to be made the rector of [[Gozzo]] Seminary. He died in 2006, at [[Naxxar]], Malta.

'''Fray José Servando Teresa de Mier Noriega y Guerra''' (October 18, 1765 &amp;ndash; December 3, 1827) was a [[Roman Catholic]] priest, preacher, and politician in [[New Spain]]. He was imprisoned several times for his controversial beliefs, and lived in exile in Spain, France and England. His sermons and writings presented revisionist theological and historical opinions that supported republicanism. Mier worked with [[Francisco Javier Mina]] during the [[Mexican War of Independence]] and, as a deputy in independent Mexico's constituent Congress, opposed [[Agustín de Iturbide]]'s claim to imperial rule. He is honored for his role in Mexican independence.

==Education==
Mier was born in [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo León]], in the colony of New Spain (in modern-day Mexico). He was a descendant of the Dukes of Granada and conquistadors of Nuevo León. At the age of 16, he entered the [[Dominican Order]] in [[Mexico City]]. He studied philosophy and theology in the College of Porta Coeli, and was ordained a priest. By the age of 27, he had earned his doctorate and was a noted preacher.

==The sermon==
On December 12, 1794, during the commemorations of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgin of Guadalupe]] apparition, in the presence of Viceroy [[Miguel de la Grúa Talamanca y Branciforte, marqués de Branciforte]], Archbishop [[Manuel Omaña y Sotomayor]] and the members of the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] of New Spain, Mier preached a sermon affirming that the apparitions of the Virgin of Guadalupe had happened 1750 years before, and not in 1531. He argued that the original painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe was on the cloak of Saint Thomas the Apostle, who had preached in the Americas long before Spanish conquest, and this had been re-discovered by [[Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin|Juan Diego]]. This sermon, with its bold revision of Mexican history and identity, was seen as a provocation. Our Lady of Guadalupe represented an intense and highly localized religious sensibility that Creole leaders, such as [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], would later use in their opposition to Spanish rule as a symbol of Mexico.

==In exile==
The sermon initially drew no attention but one week later, Archbishop [[Nuñez de Haro]] condemned condemned Mier to 10 years' exile in the convent of Las Caldas del Besaya in [[Cantabria]], Spain; a perpetual ban from teaching, preaching, or hearing confessions; and the loss of his doctoral degree.

In 1796, he was granted permission to present his case to the [[Council of the Indies]]. However, on his return from the Council, he took the wrong road and was arrested again. This time, he was confined to the Franciscan convent in [[Burgos]]. In 1801, he escaped and took refuge in [[Bayonne]], France. From Bayonne, he passed to [[Bordeaux]] and later to [[Paris]]. There he was interpreter for the rich Peruvian José Sarea, Count of Gijón.

Together with [[Simón Rodríguez]], [[Simón Bolívar]]'s former teacher, he opened an academy in Paris to teach Spanish and to translate the ''Atala'' of [[François-René de Chateaubriand]]. (The ''Atala'' was set in Louisiana, with an Indian heroine.) Mier also wrote a dissertation against [[Constantin-François de Chasseboeuf, comte de Volney]].

In Paris, he came to know Chateaubriand; [[Lucas Alamán]], then traveling as a student but later an important conservative politician in Mexico; Baron [[Alexander von Humboldt]]; and the Duke of Montmorency.  In 1802, he left the Dominican Order and became a secular priest in Rome.

When he returned to Madrid, he was again apprehended, this time for a satire he had written supporting Mexican independence. He was sent to the reformatory in [[Seville]], from which he escaped in 1804. However, he was again arrested and returned to prison, where he spent three years. Then the Pope named him his domestic prelate, because he had converted two rabbis to Catholicism.

In the war between France and Spain, he returned to Spain as military chaplain of the Volunteers of Valencia. He was present at many battles. In Belchite, he was taken prisoner by the French, but he was able to escape again (for the fifth time). He presented himself to General Blake, who recommended him to the Junta of Seville for his services. The Regency in Cádiz granted him an annual pension of 3,000 pesos.

He moved to [[London]], where he collaborated with José María Blanco on {{lang|es|[[El Español]]}}, a newspaper that supported the independence movements in Latin America.

==Expedition to New Spain==
In London, he met the Spanish revolutionary [[Francisco Javier Mina]]. Mina convinced him to join an expedition to New Spain to fight for its independence. They sailed for the United States on May 15, 1816, arriving in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], Virginia. Mier became friends with New Granadan exile [[Manuel Torres (diplomat)|Manuel Torres]] while Torres and other Spanish American agents helped organize Mina's expedition. The expedition left for New Spain in September, with disastrous results.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, "Manuel Torres, a Spanish American Patriot", pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; With the capture of the insurgents' fort at Soto la Marina on June 13, 1817, Mier was taken prisoner again, this time by the royalists. He was sent to the castle of [[San Carlos Fortress|San Carlos de Perote]], thence to the dungeons of the Inquisition, and finally, in 1820, to [[Havana]]—where he escaped for a sixth time.

===In Philadelphia===
After this escape Mier returned to the United States again in June 1821, where lived in Manuel Torres' home in [[Philadelphia]] for three months along with [[Vicente Rocafuerte]]. Torres was now acting as the Colombian representative in the U.S. Though opposites in demeanor, Mier and Torres shared a fanatical anti-monarchism and had a close friendship.&lt;ref name="Bowman1969"&gt;Bowman, "Manuel Torres in Philadelphia", p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Torres, Mier contacted Colombian secretary of foreign relations [[Pedro José Gual]] to encourage him to send a diplomat to Mexico to counter the monarchist movement there, which he did the next year. Mier published several works while in Philadelphia, including a new edition of ''[[A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'' and the anti-monarchical tract {{lang|es|Memoria politico-instructiva enviada a los gefes de Anáhuac}}. Historian Charles Bowman suggested one pamphlet bearing Mier's name, {{lang|es|La América Española dividida en dos grande departamentos, Norte y Sur o sea Septentrional y Meridional}}, was uncharacteristically moderate for Mier—and was actually Torres' work.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, "Manuel Torres in Philadelphia", pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The priest involved himself in a controversy surrounding [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]], to which he was connected through Torres and merchant [[Richard Worsam Meade I|Richard W. Meade]], another acquaintance. Mier defended the parish's excommunicated priest [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], who had offended Bishop [[Henry Conwell]]. The trustees of St. Mary's defied the bishop by keeping Hogan as their priest. For Mier this was a matter of control over what the American form of the Church should be, and he became central to the debate. In a dialog of pamphlets "Servandus Mier" made vigorous assertions and was vigorously condemned; in one response he wrote, "It is true that I was a prisoner of the inquisition ... but I would think citizens in the United States and every civilized country would consider this honourable."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, "Displaced 'Pan-Americans{{' "}}, pp. 352–354&lt;/ref&gt; He left the U.S. with a Colombian passport issued by Torres.&lt;ref name="Bowman1969" /&gt;

==Return to independent Mexico==
In February 1822, he returned to Mexico, at Veracruz, but was again taken prisoner and held at the castle of [[San Juan de Ulúa]], still in control of the Spanish. The first Mexican constituent congress was able to secure his release; he became a deputy for Nuevo León.

He opposed the Mexican Empire under [[Agustín de Iturbide]], and was arrested again. He was imprisoned in the convent of Santo Domingo, but on January 1, 1823, he escaped again, for the seventh and last time.

===As a member of the constituent congress===
He was elected a deputy to the second constituent congress. On December 13, 1823, he delivered his famous speech {{lang|es|Discurso de las profecias}} (loosely translated, ''"Prophetic Discourse"''). In this speech he argued for a centralized republic or in the event of a federal system being adopted, for its being in moderation. He was among the signers of the Act Constituting the Federation and of the Federal Constitution of the United States of Mexico. Mexico's first president, [[Guadalupe Victoria]], invited him to live in the palace.

==Death and legacy==
In 1797, he wrote a letter where he confirms that the original date of the apparition of the [[Virgen de Guadalupe]] was celebrated by the ''Mexica'' natives on September 8 (of the [[Julian calendar]]), and by the Spanish on December 12.&lt;ref&gt;Mier, ''Cartas Sobre la Tradición de Ntra. Sra. de Guadalupe de México'', 1797, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearing death, he invited his friends to a party to bid him farewell on November 16, 1827. He gave a speech justifying his life and opinions, and died on December 3, 1827. He was interred with great honor in the church of Santo Domingo in Mexico City. In 1861, his body was exhumed, together with 12 others. All the bodies were mummified.

The mummies were exhibited under the claim they were victims of the Inquisition. Some of the mummies, including Mier's, were sold to an Italian who accepted the claim. His mummy was later shown in [[Brussels]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Memoirs of Fray Servando Teresa de Mier''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} but what became of his remains after that is unknown.

Mier's name is inscribed in letters of gold on the Wall of Honor of the [[Saint Lazarus Legislative Palace|Legislative Palace of San Lázaro]], the building that today houses the [[Chamber of Deputies of Mexico|Chamber of Deputies]] in Mexico City.

==Writings==
Mier published many speeches, sermons and letters on religion and politics, including the following:

[[File:Sláinte Mhath .- Bonne santé.jpg|thumb|{{lang|ga|Sláinte Mhath}} — Good health — {{lang|fr|Bonne santé}}]]
{{lang|ga|Sláinte}} is the basic form in [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]]. Variations of this toast include {{lang|ga|sláinte mhaith}} "good health" in Irish Gaelic ({{lang|ga|mhaith}} being the [[lenition#Grammatical lenition|lenited]] form of {{lang|ga|maith}} "good"). In Irish Gaelic, the response to {{lang|ga|sláinte}} is {{lang|ga|sláinte agad-sa}}, which translates "to your health as well".

The basic [[Scottish Gaelic]] equivalent is {{lang|gd|slàinte (mhath)}}, with the same meaning, to which the normal response is {{lang|gd|do dheagh shlàinte}} "your good health".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|ga|Ó Maolalaigh, R.}} ''Scottish Gaelic in three months'' Hugo Language Books, 1996 {{ISBN|0-85285-234-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other variations such as:
* {{lang|gd|air do shlàinte}} "on your health!" with the response {{lang|gd|slàinte agad-sa}} "health at yourself!"&lt;ref&gt;Dwelly, E. ''{{lang|gd|Faclair Gàidhlig gu Beurla le Dealbhan}} / The Illustrated [Scottish] Gaelic–English Dictionary'' 4th edition 1941&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|gd|slàinte mhòr}} "great health" which is also used as a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] toast with the alternative meaning of "health to Marion", Marion ({{lang|gd|Mòr}}) being a Jacobite code name for [[Charles Edward Stuart|Prince Charles Edward Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcal.ac.uk/politicalsong/songs/macneil5.html "Lady Traquair's Brew"] Glasgow Caledonian University: Centre for Political Song. Retrieved 9 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Manx language|Manx Gaelic]] form is {{lang|gv|slaynt (vie)}}&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, M. {{lang|gv|Da Mihi Manum}} Everson Gunn Teo., Dublin 1994 {{ISBN|1-899082-00-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{lang|gv|shoh slaynt}}.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, S. ''Manx Fairy Tales'' (reprint) 2002 {{ISBN|1-873120-01-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, {{lang|gv|corp slaynt}} "healthy body" is also used in Manx.&lt;ref name="Brod"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word is an [[abstract noun]] derived from the [[Old Irish]] [[adjective]] {{lang|sga|slán}} "whole, healthy" plus the Old Irish [[suffix]] {{lang|sga|tu}}, resulting in {{lang|sga|slántu}} "health" and eventually [[Middle Irish]] {{lang|mga|sláinte}}.&lt;ref&gt;MacBain, A. (1911) ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language'' [[Stirling]] Eneas MacKay, 1982 edition by Gairm {{ISBN|0-901771-68-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oftedal, M. (1956) ''The Gaelic of Leurbost''. Oslo. Norsk Tidskrift for Sprogvidenskap.&lt;/ref&gt; The root {{lang|sga|slán}} is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European root]] ''*slā-'' "advantageous" and linked to words like [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|selig}} "blessed" and the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|salus}} "health".&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Pokorny|Pokorny, J.]] {{lang|de|Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch}} Online Edition [http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&amp;root=leiden&amp;basename=\data\ie\pokorny] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210072140/http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&amp;root=leiden&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny |date=2010-12-10 }} retrieved 8 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In some modern [[Romance language]]s, words descended from the Latin word {{lang|la|salus}} (such as {{lang|it|salute}} in [[Italian language|Italian]], {{lang|ca|salut}} in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], {{lang|es|salud}} in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) are similarly used as a toast. (However, {{lang|ro|sănătate}} in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], {{lang|oc|santat}} in [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and {{lang|fr|santé}} in [[French language|French]] are rather from Latin {{lang|la|sanitas}} "health.")

'''Souleymane Bachir Diagne''' {{IPA-fr|djaɲ|lang}}() is a [[Senegalese]] [[philosopher]], born in 1955 in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], Senegal. His work is focused on the history of [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], [[epistemology]], the tradition of philosophy in the [[Islamic world]], [[identity formation]], and [[African literature]]s and [[African philosophy|philosophies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sipa.columbia.edu/REGIONAL/IAS/html/events/eventsfall08.html Columbia University Institute of African Studies Fall 2008 Events Calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;

After passing his [[baccalauréat]] in Senegal, Diagne was admitted to the demanding public [[secondary school]] [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris, following in the footsteps, almost a half-century later, of his compatriot and the first president of Senegal, [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]]. There he prepared for the entrance exams to the [[École Normale Supérieure]], meanwhile receiving his ''license'' and ''maîtrise'' level degrees in philosophy at the [[Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne]]. At the École Normale Supérieure he studied with [[Althusser]] and [[Derrida]]. After receiving his agrégation in Philosophy (1978), Diagne spent a year at [[Harvard University]] in an exchange program. In 1982 he defended a doctoral thesis in mathematics at Université Paris I, where, in 1988, he also completed his doctorat d’Etat, under the direction of [[Jean-Toussaint Desanti]], on [[George Boole]]’s algebra of logic.

In 1982 Diagne returned to his native country to teach philosophy at [[Cheikh Anta Diop University]] in [[Dakar]], where he became vice-dean of the College of Humanities. The former president of the Republic of Senegal, [[Abdou Diouf]], named him Counselor for Education and Culture, a position which he held from 1993 to 1999.

Diagne is co-director of ''Éthiopiques'', a Senegalese journal of [[literature]] and philosophy and a member of the editorial committees of numerous [[academic journal|scholarly journals]], including the ''Revue d’histoire des mathématiques'', ''[[Présence africaine]]'', and ''[[Public Culture]]''. He is a member of the scientific committees of ''[[Diogenes (journal)|Diogenes]]'' (published by [[UNESCO]]’s International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies), [[CODESRIA]] (''Conseil pour le développement de la recherche en sciences sociales en Afrique''), and of the [[Africa|African]] and [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] Committee for Higher Education (CAMES), as well as UNESCO’s Council on the Future. He has been named by ''[[Le Nouvel observateur]]'' one of the 50 thinkers of our time. In October 2007 he was invited to participate in a white paper commission on the defense and national security in the French Senate in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcpan.fr Video of the white paper commission hearing (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

His main publications include two books on George Boole, a book on the Pakistani poet-philosopher ''[[Muhammad Iqbal]]'', ''Islam et société ouverte. La fidélité et le mouvement dans la pensée de Muhammad Iqbal'' (2001) and an examination of Senghor’s philosophy, ''Léopold Sédar Senghor. L’Art africain comme  philosophie'' (2007). He is currently working on a book on [[Islam]] and philosophy: ''Comment philosopher en Islam''.

Having taught for several years in the departments of Philosophy and Religion at [[Northwestern University]] (2002 to 2007), Diagne is currently Professor of [[French language|French]], and Chair of the Department of French and Romance Philology with a secondary appointment in the Department of Philosophy, at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/french/department/newsletters/newsletter2007.pdf Columbia University Department of French and Romance Philology Annual Newsletter, December 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stumbling block''' or '''scandal''' in the [[Bible]], or in politics (including history), is a [[metaphor]] for a behaviour or attitude that leads another to [[sin]] or to destructive behaviour. 

==Bible use==

===Hebrew Bible===
The origin of the metaphor is the prohibition of putting a stumbling block before the blind ({{bibleverse|Leviticus|19:14|}}). [[Geoffrey W. Bromiley]] calls the image "especially appropriate to a rocky land like [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Geoffrey W. Bromiley |encyclopedia=The international standard Bible encyclopedia |page=641 |year=1995 |quote=The concept of a stumbling block was especially appropriate to a rocky land like Palestine, where stones and pebbles are plentiful on all the unpaved roads (in contrast to countries with alluvial soil, like Egypt or Mesopotamia).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the term for "stumbling block" is [[Biblical Hebrew]] {{transl|he|miḵšōl}} ({{lang|he|מִכְשׁוֹל|rtl=yes}}). In the [[Septuagint]], {{transl|he|miḵšōl}} is translated into [[Koine Greek]] {{transl|grc|skandalon}} ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|σκανδαλον}}}}), a word which occurs only in [[Hellenistic literature]], in the sense "snare for an enemy; cause of moral stumbling".&lt;ref name="oedetymology"&gt;OED "scandal", etymology.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Septuagint {{bibleverse|Psalms|140:9|}} a stumbling block means anything that leads to sin.&lt;ref name="Khatry"&gt;{{cite  dissertation |origyear=1991 |isbn=158112094X |first=Ramesh |last=Khatry |title=The Authenticity of the Parable of the Wheat and the Tares and Its Interpretation |date=July 15, 2000 |institution=[[Westminster College, Oxford]] in collaboration with [[Wycliffe Hall, Oxford|Wycliffe Hall]] |page=137 |quote=Thematically, the usage in Mt 13:41 resembles that of Jewish tradition where to skandalon merely means anything that leads to sin. For example, Mt 13:41b is very similar to LXX Ps 140:9. LXX Ps 140:9 – apo skandalōn tōn ergazomenōn tēn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
The New Testament usages of {{lang|el-Latn|skandalon}}, such as {{bibleverse|Matthew|13:41|}}, resemble Septuagint usage.&lt;ref name="Khatry"/&gt; It appears 15 times in the New Testament in 12 unique verses according to [[Strong's Concordance]].  These passages are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G4625|title=G4625 - skandalon - Strong's Greek Lexicon (KJV)|work=blueletterbible.org|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{bibleverse|Matthew|13:41|}}, {{bibleverse|Matthew|16:23|}} , {{bibleverse|Matthew|18:7|}}  (3 times), {{bibleverse|Luke|17:1|}} , {{bibleverse|Romans|9:33|}}, {{bibleverse|Romans|11:9|}}, {{bibleverse|Romans|14:13|}}, {{bibleverse|Romans|16:17|}}, {{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|1:23|}}, {{bibleverse|Galatians|5:11|}}, {{bibleverse|1 Peter|2:8|}}, {{bibleverse|1 John|2:10|}}, and {{bibleverse|Revelation|2:14|}}.

The noun  {{lang|el-Latn|skandalon}} has a derived [[verb]], {{lang|el-Latn|skandalizo}} (formed with the {{lang|el-Latn|-iz}} suffix as English "scandalize"), meaning literally "to trip somebody up" or, idiomatically, "to cause someone to sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gospel according to Matthew: an introduction and commentary |page=271 |first=R. T. |last=France |year=1985 |quote=(ii) On stumbling-blocks (18:6–9) These sayings are linked together by the words skandalizo ('cause to sin', w. 6,8,9) and skandalon ('temptation (to sin)' 3 times in v. 7), a 'stumbling-block', something which trips someone up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This verb appears 29 times in 27 New Testament verses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=g4624|title=G4624 - skandalizō - Strong's Greek Lexicon (KJV)|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=blueletterbible.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from ''skandalon'' the idiom of "stumbling block" has a second [[synonym]] in the Greek term ''proskomma'' "stumbling."&lt;ref name="Hovey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/S/stumbling-block-stumbling-stone.html|title=Stumbling-block; Stumbling-stone|last=Hovey|first=George Rice|year=1939|work=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The rhetorical role of Scripture in 1 Corinthians |page=141 |first=John Paul |last=Heil |year=2005 |quote=... then Paul will never eat any meat whatsoever in order not to "cause to sin" (skandali&amp;sw) a fellow believer (8:13)... become a "stumbling block" (proskomma) to those in the audience who do not possess the knowledge that idols are....}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=g4348|title=G4348 - proskomma - Strong's Greek Lexicon (KJV)|work=blueletterbible.org|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both words are used together in [[1 Peter]] 2:8; this is a "stone of stumbling" ({{lang|el-Latn|lithos proskommatos}} λίθος προσκόμματος) and a "rock of offense" ({{lang|el-Latn|petra skandalou}} πέτρα σκανδάλου).&lt;ref name="Hovey" /&gt;  The antonymous adjective {{lang|el-Latn|aproskopos}} (ἀπρόσκοπος), "without causing anyone to stumble," also occurs three times in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G677&amp;t=KJV|title=G677 - aproskopos - Strong's Greek Lexicon (KJV)|work=blueletterbible.org|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later use==
===Judaism===
{{main|lifnei iver}}
The Leviticus warning is developed in [[rabbinical Judaism]] as ''[[lifnei iver]]'' "before the blind."

===Christianity===

====Catholicism====
"Scandal" is discussed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Vander Heeren 1912, "Notion of scandal"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3043.htm#article|title=Scandal|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|year=1920|work=SUMMA THEOLOGICA|pages=Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 43|language=English|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1992 ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', it is discussed under the fifth commandment ([[Thou shalt not kill]]) section "Respect for the Dignity of Persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P80.HTM|title=Part three: Life in Christ / Section two: The Ten Commandments / Chapter two: You shall love your neighbor as yourself / Article 5: The fifth commandment / ii. Respect for the dignity of persons |year=1992|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|publisher=[[Holy See]]|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Active scandal'' is performed by a person; ''passive scandal'' is the reaction of a person to active scandal ("scandal given" or in Latin {{lang|la|scandalum datum}}), or to acts which, because of the viewer's ignorance, weakness, or malice, are regarded as scandalous ("scandal received" or in Latin {{lang|la|scandalum acceptum}}).&lt;ref&gt;Vander Heeren 1912, "Divisions"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to qualify as scandalous, the behavior must, in itself, be evil or give the appearance of evil.&lt;ref name="cases1"&gt;Vander Heeren 1912, "Cases in which the sin of scandal occurs (1)"&lt;/ref&gt;   To do a good act or an [[indifferent act]], even knowing that it will inspire others to sin — as when a student studies diligently to do well, knowing it will cause [[envy]] — is not scandalous.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;  Again, to ask someone to commit [[perjury]] is scandalous, but for a judge to require witnesses to give an oath even when he knows the witness is likely to commit perjury is not scandalous.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt; It does not require that the other person actually commit sin; to be scandalous, it suffices that the act is of a nature to lead someone to sin.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt; Scandal is performed with the intention of inducing someone to sin.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;  Urging someone to commit a sin is therefore active scandal.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;  In the case where the person urging the sin is aware of its nature and the person he is urging is ignorant, the sins committed are the fault of the person who urged them.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt; Scandal is also performed when someone performs an evil act, or an act that appears to be evil, knowing that it will lead others into sin.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;  (In case of an apparently evil act, a sufficient reason for the act despite the faults it will cause negates the scandal.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;) Scandal may also be incurred when an innocent act may be an [[occasion of sin]] to the weak, but such acts should not be foregone if the goods at stake are of importance.&lt;ref name="cases3"&gt;Vander Heeren 1912, "Cases in which the sin of scandal occurs (3)"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestantism====
The term "stumbling block" is common in Protestant writings. An early use was [[Martin Luther]]'s consideration that the common belief that the Mass was a sacrifice was a "stumbling block."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert C. |last=Croken |title=Luther's first front: the Eucharist as sacrifice |page=26 |year=1990 |quote=A second stumbling block (and it is significant that Luther considers it a "second" stumbling block) to the true doctrine of the Mass is the common belief that the Mass is a sacrifice. According to this belief, Christ is offered to God ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  Greek word {{lang|el-Latn|skandalon}} was [[loanword|borrowed]] from Greek to Latin to French, and finally to English as "scandal".&lt;ref name="oedetymology"/&gt; The modern English meaning of ''[[scandal]]'' is a [[semantic drift|development]] from the religious meaning, via the intermediate sense of "damage to reputation".&lt;ref&gt;OED "scandal", senses 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swami Raman Kalimuthu Murugesu''' was a [[Gayathri Siddhar]] and the creator of the Sri Lankatheeswara temple in [[Nuwara Eliya]].

==Early life==

Raman Kalimuthu Murugesu was born in a poverty-stricken household on 26 October 1933. Since his family was so poor, he had to begin working as a laborer in the fields at the age of 12. It was at that time in his life that he was presented with a book of [[mantras]] for Lord [[Ganesha]], given to him by a great [[Mahatma]]. Murugesu started to chant regularly.

==Creation of the Sri Lankatheeswara temple==

Gayathri Siddhar Swami Murugesu is the founder of Sri Lankatheeswarar temple in 1974 with his sole efforts, and had counted thousands of devotees all over the world and hundreds of admirers including leading figures within the country and abroad, among whom were Prime Ministers and others, visiting this temple and getting his blessings, who had tirelessly worked for peace and amity all over the world.  The Sri Lankatheeswarar temple is the first and the foremost temple built for Gayathri Amman in Sri Lanka, and the Shiva Lingham installed in this temple was brought from the holy river Narmada by Sri Sivabalayogi Maharaj.
This temple has showered with endless blessings of Siddhars especially Gayathri Siddhar Swami Murugesu. Swami MurugesuHe had an ashram next to the temple and lived next to the ashram. There was also a block of sandy steps leading up to a big hall, where Murugesu conducted [[yagnas]] and did rituals for [[Poya]] day. In the temple there was a big [[Shivalingam]], that would have an [[abishekam]] every month. There is a black statue of Goddess Gayathri is there opposite to the temple.

==Guru==
Murugesu went to India and admitted to [[Sri Kannaiya Yogi]]s Ashram and became his disciple. There he researched in to [[Gayatri Mantra]] and written many books based on his researches. Hence he is also known as Gayathri Siddha by his disciples.

==Disciples==

Many flocked to the ashram and became Murugesu's disciples. One of them was Swami Shankarananda Maharajji who runs the Gayathri Peedam in South Africa, which was consecrated personally by Swami Murugesu in 1998. Another disciple is Swami Radhakrishnan who runs a Meditation centre in Germany and the Gayathri Meditation is held there.

==Mahasamadhi==

Swami Murugesu decided to enter into mahasamadhi to release his soul from the perishable body and attained "Jeevan Mukthi" on 24 September 2007 in India and his samadhi was laid in the Gayathri Mandir of the Sri Lankatheeswarar temple. Now and always his divine pisciower guides the disciples and devotees which is felt by them day to day. Now, according to guru's guidance the establishment of temple for 108 "Suyambu" linghams are held and hope to have a kumbhabhiseham for that in near future.
A samadhi shrine containing some of Swami Murugesu's possessions is also installed in the South Africa branch.

}}
The '''''Tejobindu Upanishad''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: तेजोबिन्दु उपनिषद्) is a minor [[Upanishad]] in the corpus of Upanishadic texts of [[Hinduism]].{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=557, 713}} It is one of the five ''Bindu Upanishads'', all attached to the [[Atharvaveda]],{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=567}} and one of twenty [[Yoga Upanishads]] in the four [[Vedas]].{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=vii}}&lt;ref&gt;GM Patil (1978), Ishvara in Yoga philosophy, The Brahmavadin, Volume 13, Vivekananda Prakashan Kendra, pages 209–210&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is notable for its focus on [[Dhyana in Hinduism|meditation]], calling dedication to bookish learning as rubbish, emphasizing practice instead, and presenting the [[Vedanta]] doctrine from [[Yoga]] perspective.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=705–707}}

The Tejobindu is listed at number 37 in the serial order of the [[Muktika]] enumerated by [[Rama]] to [[Hanuman]] in the modern era [[anthology]] of 108 Upanishads.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=556}}

==Nomenclature==
''Tejobindu'', states [[Paul Deussen]], means "the point representing the power of [[Brahman]]", wherein the point is the ''[[Anusvara]]'' in [[Om]].{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=705}}

The Tejobindu Upanishad is sometimes spelled as ''Tejabindu Upanishad'' ([[Sanskrit]]: तेजबिन्दु), such as in the Poona manuscript versions.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=705 with footnote 1}}

==Chronology and anthology==
[[Mircea Eliade]] suggests that Tejobindu Upanishad was possibly composed in the same period as the didactic parts of the [[Mahabharata]], the chief [[Sannyasa]] Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads: Brahmabindu (probably composed about the same time as [[Maitri Upanishad]]), Ksurika, [[Amritabindu Upanishad|Amritabindu]], [[Brahmavidya Upanishad|Brahmavidya]], [[Nada Bindu Upanishad|Nadabindu]], [[Yogashikha Upanishad|Yogashikha]], [[Dhyanabindu Upanishad|Dhyanabindu]] and [[Yogatattva Upanishad|Yogatattva]].&lt;ref name=eliadeyif128/&gt; Eliade's suggestion places these in the final centuries of BCE or early centuries of the CE. All these, adds Eliade, were likely composed earlier than the ten or eleven later Yoga Upanishads such as the [[Yoga-kundalini Upanishad| Yoga-kundalini]], [[Varaha Upanishad|Varaha]] and [[Pashupatabrahma Upanishad]]s.&lt;ref name=eliadeyif128&gt;Mircea Eliade (1970), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691017646}}, pages 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Gavin Flood]] dates the Tejobindu text, along with other Yoga Upanishads, to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=96}}

This Upanishad is among those which have been differently attached to two [[Vedas]], depending on the region where the manuscript was found. Deussen states, it and all Bindu Upanishads are attached to the Atharvaveda,{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=567}} while Ayyangar states it is attached to the [[Krishna Yajurveda]].{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=27}}&lt;ref&gt;Alain Danielou (1991), Yoga: Mastering the Secrets of Matter and the Universe, Inner Traditions, {{ISBN|978-0892813018}}, page 168&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|Colebrooke]]'s version of 52 Upanishads, popular in north India, lists this Upanishad's text at number 21 along with the other four Bindu Upanishads with similar theme.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=561}} The Narayana anthology also includes this Upanishad at number 21 in ''Bibliothica Indica''.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=562}} In the collection of Upanishads under the title "Oupanekhat", put together by Sultan Mohammed [[Dara Shikhoh]] in 1656, consisting of a [[Persian language|Persian]] translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, the Tejobindu is listed at number 27 and is named ''Tidj bandeh.''{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=558–59}}

==Structure==
This text is part of the five ''Bindu [[Upanishads]]'' collection, the longest among the five, the other four being the ''Nadabindu Upanishad'', the ''Brahmabindu Upanishad'', the ''[[Amritabindu Upanishad]]'' and the ''Dhyanabindu Upanishad'', all forming part of the [[Atharvaveda]]. All five of Bindu Upanishads emphasize the practice of Yoga and [[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]] (meditation) with Om, to apprehend [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self).{{Sfn|Deussen|2010|p=9}}

Like almost all other Yoga Upanishads, the text is composed in poetic verse form.{{Sfn|Deussen|2010|p=26}}

The text exists in multiple versions. The manuscript translated by [[Paul Deussen|Deussen]] is short. It has fourteen verses, describing how difficult meditation is in its first two verses, the requirements for a successful meditative practice in next two, the need for the universal constant [[Brahman]] as the radiant focal point of meditation and the nature of Brahman in verses 5 to 11, then closes the text by describing the Yogi who has achieved the state of "liberation, freedom" ([[moksha]]) while being alive.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=705–707}}

The manuscript translated by TRS Ayyangar of Adyar Library is long, and has six chapters with a cumulative total of 465 verses.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=27–87}} The first chapter contains 51 verses, the second has 43 verses, the third with 74 verses, the fourth contains 81 verses, fifth has 105, and the last sixth chapter has 111 verses.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=27–87}} Two chapters, in the longer version, are structured as a discourse, with chapters 2 to 4 between Kumara and his father Shiva, and the last two chapters between Nidagha and Ribhu.{{Sfn|Larson|Potter|1970|p=596}}{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=27–87}} Deussen states that the shorter form may be a trimmed, "enormously corrupt text transmission".{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=705}}

==Contents==
[[File:Meditation yoga in Hinduism Buddhism Jainism.jpg|thumb|The text does not esteem scriptural studies, and encourages the practice of meditation instead.{{Sfn|Deussen|2010|p=390}}]]
===Meditation is difficult===
The text opens by asserting that ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]]'' (meditation) is difficult, and increasingly so as one proceeds from gross, then fine, then superfine states.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=705}} Even the wise and those who are alone, states the text, find meditation difficult to establish, implement and accomplish.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=706}}

===How to meditate successfully?===
For success in ''Dhyana'', asserts the text, one must first conquer anger, greed, lust, attachments, expectations, worries about wife and children.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=706}}{{Sfn|Easwaran|2010|p=228}} Give up sloth and lead a virtuous life.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=28}} Be temperate in the food you eat, states Tejobindu, abandon your delusions, and crave not.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=28–30}} Find a [[Guru]], respect him and strive to learn from him, states the text.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=706}}

===The fifteen limb yoga===
{{Quote box |width=22em | bgcolor=#FFE0BB |align=right |salign = right 
|quote='''Definition of Yamas'''
&lt;poem&gt;
[[Yamas]] is restraining organs of perception and action, in and through knowledge.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|source =— ''Tejobindu Upanishad'' 1.17{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=30–31}}}}
The Tejobindu Upanishad begins its discussion of Yoga, with a list of fifteen ''Angas'' (limbs), as follows: [[Yamas]] (self control), [[Niyama]] (right observances), [[Tyaga]] (renunciation), [[Mauna (silence)|Mauna]] (silence, inner quietness), Desa (right place, seclusion), [[Kāla (time)|Kala]] (right time), [[Asana]] (correct posture), [[Mula Bandha|Mula-bandha]] (stopping all connection with the world), Dehasamyama (body equilibrium, no quivering), Drksthiti (mind equilibrium, stable introspection), Pranasamyama (breath equilibrium), [[Pratyahara]] (breath exercises), [[Dharana]] (concentration), Atma-dhyana (meditation on soul), [[Samadhi]] (union of soul with Brahman).{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=30–33}}{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 1.15–1.16}}

The Tejobindu briefly defines these fifteen limbs in verses 1.17 to 1.37, without details. The verses 1.38 to 1.51 describe the difficulty in achieving meditation and Samadhi, and ways to overcome these difficulties.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=33–36}}{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 1.38–1.51}} One must function in the world and be good at what one does, improve upon it, yet avoid longing, state verses 1.44–1.45. Physical yoga alone does not provide the full results, unless introspection and right knowledge purifies the mind, state verses 1.48–1.49 of the longer manuscript.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=33–36}} One must abandon anger, selfish bonds to things and people, likes and dislikes to achieve Samadhi, states verse 3 of the shorter version of the manuscript.{{Sfn|Easwaran|2010|p=228}}

===The indivisible oneness in the essence of all===
Chapter 2 is a discourse from Shiva to his son [[Karttikeya|Kumara]] on "Individual One Essence". This is Atman (soul, self), states Shiva, it is all existence, the entire world, all knowledge, all space, all time, all Vedas, all introspection, all perceptors, all bodies, all minds, all learning, all that is little, all that is big, and it is Brahman.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=36–39}}{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 2.1–2.23}} "Individual One Essence" is identical to but called by many names such as [[Hari]] and [[Rudra]], and it is without origin, it is gross, subtle and vast in form. "Individual One Essence" is thou, a mystery, that which is permanent, and that which is the knower.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=36–39}} It is the father, it is the mother, it is the sutra, it is the ''Vira'', what is within, what is without, the nectar, the home, the sun, the crop field, the tranquility, the patience, the good quality, the Om, the radiance, the true wealth, the Atman.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=36–39}}{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 2.1–2.23}}

Shiva describes the nature of consciousness in verses 2.24–2.41, and asserts the [[Vedanta]] doctrine, "Atman is identical with Brahman" in the final verses of chapter 2.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=40–41}}{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 2.24–2.43}}

===Atman and Brahman===
The ''Tejabindu Upanishad'', states [[Swami Madhavananda|Madhavananda]], conceives the Supreme ''Atman'' dwelling in the heart of man, as the most subtle centre of effulgence, revealed to [[yogi]]s by super-sensuous meditation.&lt;ref name=madhavananda&gt;{{cite book|title=Minor Upanishads|author=Swami Madhavananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=28|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/minor-upanishads-madhavananda/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Atman and its identity with Brahman, the nature of [[Tat Tvam Asi]], is the subject of text's chapter 3, one to be meditated upon, and realised in essence, for the absolute freedom of the soul.&lt;ref name=madhavananda/&gt;&lt;ref name=parmeshwarananda&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upanishads, Vol.3|author=Swami Parmeshwaranand|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|pages=779–794|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1zQytiw_cg8C&amp;pg=PA779&amp;dq=Tejobindu+upanishad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7ekXU9_zIIKmrQfRjoCgAQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzgy#v=onepage&amp;q=Tejobindu%20upanishad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text attributes Shiva explaining the non-dual ([[Advaita]]) nature of Atman and Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Minor Upanishads|author=Swami Madhavananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=28–33|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/minor-upanishads-madhavananda/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verses describe the Atman to be bliss, peace, contentment, consciousness, emotions, delight, satisfaction, absolute, imperishable, bright, ''Nirguna'' (without attributes or qualities), without beginning, without end, and repeatedly states "I am Atman", "I am Brahman" and the "Indivisible One Essence".{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=41–46}}{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 3.1–3.43}} The Upanishad also states that the ultimate reality (Brahman) is also Vishnu, same as consciousness.{{Sfn|Larson|Potter|1970|pp=596–597}} This discussion in Tejobindu Upanishad, a Yoga Upanishad, is same as in the major Vedanta Upanishads.{{Sfn|Larson|Potter|1970|pp=596–597}}

In the shorter manuscript version, translates [[Eknath Easwaran]], "the Brahman gives himself through his infinite grace" to ones who abandon life's duality.{{Sfn|Easwaran|2010|p=229}}

===Jivanmukti and Videhamukti===
[[File:Jezioro Okra 11.jpg|thumb|The text describes [[Jivanmukta]] as a person who has realized his Self, that he is pure ''Hamsa'' (migrating swan).{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=54}}]]
The chapter 4 of the Upanishad, in a discourse from Shiva to his son Kumara, describes Jivanmukta as follows (abridged):

{{Quote|
He is known as a Jivan-mukta who stands alone in Atman, who realizes he is transcendent and beyond transcendent, who understands, "I am pure consciousness, I am the Brahman". He feels that there is Brahman, who is full of exquisite bliss, and that he is He, he is that bliss. His mind is clear, he is devoid of worries, he is beyond egoism, beyond lust, beyond anger, beyond blemish, beyond symbols, beyond his changing body, beyond bondage, beyond reincarnation, beyond precept, beyond religious merit, beyond sin, beyond dualism, beyond three worlds, beyond nearness, beyond distant. He is the one who realizes, "I am the Brahman, I am the Brahman, Consciousness am I, Consciousness am I".
|Tejobindu Upanishad|4.1–4.30{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 4.1–4.30}}{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=50–54}}}}

The text asserts that a Jivanmukta has Self-knowledge, knows his Atman is pure [[Hamsa (bird)|Hamsa]] (migrant swan), he is firmly planted in his soul, in the kingdom of his soul, peaceful, comfortable, kind, happy, living by his own accord.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=54}}{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 4.31–4.32}} He is "the Lord of his own Atman", state verses 4.31–4.32 of the text.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=54}}{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 4.31–4.32}}

The Tejobindu Upanishad, in verses 4.33–4.79 describes ''Videhamukta'', and the difference between [[Videha mukti]] and Jivanmukti.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=54–60}}

A Videhamukta, states the text, is one who is beyond the witness (4th). {{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=54–55} he is beyond "all is Brahman" conviction.  He sees all in his Atman, but does not have the conviction that I am Brahman.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=54–55}} A Videhamukta accepts the other world, and has no fear of the other world.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=56}} He who does not conceive of "Thou Art That", "this Atman is the Brahman", yet is the Atman that never decays, is consciousness, devoid of light and non-light, is blissful, is Videhamukta states verses 4.68–4.79 of the text.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=59–60}}{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 4.68–4.79}}

===Atman versus Anatman===
The fifth chapter of the text presents the theory of Atman and of [[Anatman (Hinduism)|Anatman]], as a discourse between Muni Nidagha and the Vedic sage [[Ribhus|Ribhu]].{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=61}}

Atman is imperishable, states Ribhu, full of bliss, transcendent, bright, luminous, eternal, the same as Brahman and it is Brahman alone.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=61–62}}{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 5.1–5.15}} Anatman (not-self) is a false concept, asserts Ribhu, and there is no such thing as Anatman by reason that it contradicts volition.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=63–64}}{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 5.16–5.21}} The Anatman concept that assumes absence of mind is flawed because if mind is nonexistent then nothing could be conceived, just like no destination could be reached in the absence of feet, and no work can be done in the absence of hands or no death can happen in the absence of birth, states the text in verses 5.16 to 5.21.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=63–64}}{{Sfn| Hattangadi|2015|pp=verses 5.16–5.21}} Anatman is false, asserts the text, as it implies no morals, "there is no Second in the absence of Unity and there is no Unity in the absence of the Second", translates Ayyangar.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=63–64}}

The verses in chapter 5 repeat the ideas of the previous chapters.{{Sfn|Larson|Potter|1970|p=597}} It adds in verses 5.89–5.97 that the idea, "I am my body" is false and this definition of self is a reason for bondage, it is a false impression created by mind, then asserts the truth to be that the real, unchanging is the Atman.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=71–74}} It is also stated that this chapter is probably a later addition to the original version of the Upanishad.{{Sfn|Larson|Potter|1970|p=597}}

===The nature of Satcitananda===
The last chapter continues the discourse attributed to Muni Nidagha and the Vedic age [[Ribhu]]. Everything is of ''sat-cit-ananda'', existence-consciousness-bliss asserts Ribhu, it is the imperishable essence.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=74–75}} There is, translates TRS Ayyangar of [[Adyar Library]], no "thou", nor "I" nor "other", and all is the absolute Brahman.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=74–75}} There are no scriptures, no beginning, no end, no misery, no happiness, no illusions, no such thing as arising out of gods nor evil spirits nor five elements, no permanence, no transience, no worship, no prayer, no oblation, no mantra, no thief, no kindness, nothing except existence-consciousness-bliss.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=75–77}} 

All is Brahman alone.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=77–78}} Time is Brahman, states Ribhu, Art is, happiness is, Self-luminous is, fascination is, tranquility is, virtue is, auspicious is, inauspicious is, pure is, impure is, all the world is of the Brahman.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=77–78}} Brahman is Atman, there is no world other than that of the Atman.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=79–80}} Know thyself as a form of Brahman.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=79–80}}
{{Quote|'''The one who is liberated, in satcitananda'''
&lt;poem&gt;
Greed, delusion, fear, pride, anger, love, sin renouncing,
Not proud of the [[Brahmin]] descent, not of the rubbish liberation texts,
Knowing no fear, nor lust, nor pain, nor respect, nor disrespect any more,
Because from all these is free, [[Brahman]], the highest goal of all endeavor.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Tejobindu Upanishad|Translated by [[Paul Deussen]] (Abridged){{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=707}}{{Refn|group=note|Eknath Easwaran translates these verses differently, as follows:&lt;br&gt;Brahman cannot be realized by those,&lt;br&gt;who are subject to greed, fear, and anger.&lt;br&gt;Brahman cannot be realized by those,&lt;br&gt;who are subject to the pride of name and fame,&lt;br&gt;Or to the vanity of scholarship.&lt;br&gt;Brahman cannot be realized by those,&lt;br&gt;who are enmeshed in life's duality.&lt;br&gt;But to all those who pierce this duality,&lt;br&gt;He gives himself through his infinite grace.{{Sfn|Easwaran|2010|p=229}}}}}}

==Reception==
The Tejobindu Upanishad, states Laurence Rosan, Professor and Departmental Representative in [[University of Chicago]], is a classic in the history of absolute subjective idealism.{{Sfn|Rosan|1981|p=53}} The [[Neoplatonism]] of [[Proclus]], though not identical, parallels the monistic idealism found in Tejobindu Upanishad.{{Sfn|Rosan|1981|pp=45–46, 60–61}} The 5th-century CE philosopher Proclus of [[Greece]] proposed organic unity of all levels of reality, the integrative immanence of One Reality, and universal love.{{Sfn|Rosan|1981|pp=45–50}} These ideas independently appear, states Rosan, in Tejobindu Upanishad as well, in the most fully developed, longest litany of singular consciousness.{{Sfn|Rosan|1981|pp=52–53}}

While the conceptual foundations of Tejobindu are found in ancient major Upanishads such as the [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chandogya]] (~800–600 BCE) and many minor Upanishads such as [[Atmabodha Upanishad|Atmabodha]], [[Maitreyi Upanishad|Maitreyi]] and [[Subala Upanishad|Subala]], it is Tejobindu that dwells on the idea extensively, states Rosan, with the phrases ''Akhanda-eka-rasa'' (Undivided One Essence, One Reality) and ''Cit-matra'' (Consciousness itself).{{Sfn|Rosan|1981|pp=54–56}} The absolute idealism doctrine in Tejobindu is closely related to the Neoplatonic doctrine of Proclus.{{Sfn|Rosan|1981|p=55}Atmabodha}

{{Quote|
The Tejobindu stands as a wonderful monument in the history of subjective monistic idealism, a minority type within idealism in general; the Tejobindu is a victorious, fully accomplished statement.
|Laurence Rosan|Proclus and the Tejobindu Upanisad{{Sfn|Rosan|1981|p=61}}}}

It is also said that the nondualism concept in Tejobindu is philosophic, and  cannot be reduced to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].{{Sfn|Rosan|1981|p=331}}

The text has also been important to the historical study of Indian yoga traditions. [[Klaus Klostermaier]], for example, states that Tejobindu Upanishad is a fairly detailed Hindu treatise on [[Raja Yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaus K. Klostermaier (2000), Hindu Writings: A Short Introduction to the Major Sources, Oneworld, {{ISBN|978-1851682300}}, page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6881">'''Transcendent theosophy''' or '''al-hikmat al-muta’li''' (حكمت متعالي), the doctrine and [[philosophy]] developed by [[Iranian philosophy|Persian philosopher]] [[Mulla Sadra]], is one of two main disciplines of [[Islamic philosophy]] that is currently live and active.&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Nasr, ''Islamic Philosophy from its Origin to the Present: Philosophy in the Land of Prophecy'' (2006), SUNY Press, passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The expression al-hikmat al-muta’liyah comprises two terms al-hikmat (meaning literally, ''wisdom''; and technically, ''philosophy'', and by contextual extension ''theosophy'') and muta’liyah (meaning ''exalted'' or ''Transcendent''). This school of Mulla Sadra in Islamic philosophy is usually called al-hikmat al-muta’liyah. It is a most appropriate name for his school, not only for historical reasons, but also because the doctrines of Mulla Sadra are both hikmah or theosophy in its original sense and an intellectual vision of the transcendent which leads to the Transcendent Itself. So Mulla Sadra’s school is transcendent for both historical and [[Islamic metaphysics|metaphysical reasons]].

When Mulla Sadra talked about hikmah or theosophy in his words, he usually meant the transcendent philosophy. He gave many definitions to the term hikmah, the most famous one is: hikmah is a vehicle through which “man becomes an intelligible world resembling the objective world and similar to the order of universal existence”.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Mulla Sadra's philosophy and [[ontology]] is considered to be just as important to Islamic philosophy as [[Martin Heidegger]]'s philosophy later was to [[Western philosophy]] in the 20th century. Mulla Sadra bought "a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of [[reality]]" and created "a major transition from [[essentialism]] to [[existentialism]]" in Islamic philosophy.&lt;ref name=Kamal&gt;{{citation|title=Mulla Sadra's Transcendent Philosophy|first=Muhammad|last=Kamal|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-7546-5271-8|pages=9 &amp; 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existentialism==
A concept that lies at the heart of Mulla Sadra's philosophy is the idea of "[[existence precedes essence]]", a key foundational concept of [[existentialism]] which was not popularized in the West until [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in the 20th century.{{dubious|date=March 2013}} This was also the opposite of the idea of "[[essence]] precedes [[existence]]" previously supported by [[Avicenna]] and his school of [[Avicennism]]&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{citation|first=Jones|last=Irwin|title=Averroes' Reason: A Medieval Tale of Christianity and Islam|url=http://www.averroes.or.id/averroes-reason-a-medieval-tale-of-christianity-and-islam.html|date=Autumn 2002|journal=[[The Philosopher]]|volume=LXXXX|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] and his school of [[Illuminationist philosophy|Illuminationism]]. Sayyid Jalal Ashtiyani later summarizes Mulla Sadra's concept as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Razavi|1997|pp=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The existent being that has an essence must then be caused and existence that is pure existence ... is therefore a Necessary Being."}}

For Mulla Sadra, "existence precedes the essence and is thus principle since something has to exist first and then have an essence." This is primarily the argument that lies at the heart of Mulla Sadra's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Razavi|1997|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulla Sadra substituted a [[metaphysics]] of existence for the traditional metaphysics of essences, and giving priority [[Ab initio]] to existence over [[quiddity]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), pp. 342 and 343&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulla Sadra effected a revolution in the metaphysics of being by his thesis that there are no immutable essences, but that each essence is determined and variable according to the degree of intensity of its act of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), pp. 342-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In his view reality is existence,  in a variety of ways, and these different ways look to us like essences. What first affects us are things that exist and we form ideas of essences afterward, so existence precedes essence. This position referred to as primacy of existence ({{lang-ar|Isalat al-Wujud}}).&lt;ref&gt;Leaman (2007), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulla Sadra's existentialism is therefore fundamentally different from Western, i.e. existentialism of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because, there is no Creator, no God.  This is the meaning of "existence precedes essence" in Sartre's existentialism.&lt;ref&gt;''Existentialism and Humanism'', page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substantial motion==
Another central concept of Mulla Sadra's philosophy is the theory of "substantial motion" (''al-harakat al-jawhariyyah''), which is "based on the premise that everything in the order of nature, including [[celestial spheres]], undergoes substantial change and transformation as a result of the self-[[Flow (psychology)|flow]] (''fayd'') and penetration of being (''sarayan al-wujud'') which gives every concrete individual entity its share of being. In contrast to [[Aristotle]] and [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] who had accepted change only in four [[Categorization|categories]], i.e., [[quantity]] (''kamm''), [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] (''kayf''), [[wiktionary:position|position]] (''wad’'') and [[wiktionary:place|place]] (''‘ayn''), Sadra defines change as an all-pervasive [[reality]] running through the entire cosmos including the category of [[Substance theory|substance]] (''jawhar'')."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ibrahim|last=Kalin|contribution=Sadr al-Din Shirazi (Mulla Sadra) (b. 1571-1640)|url=http://www.cis-ca.org/voices/s/sadra.htm|title=Resources on Islam &amp; Science|editor1-first=Muzaffar|editor1-last=Iqbal|editor1-link=Muzaffar Iqbal|editor2-first=Ibrahim|editor2-last=Kalin|date=March 2001|accessdate=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heraclitus]] described a similar concept centuries earlier ({{lang|grc|Πάντα ῥεῖ}} - panta rhei - "everything is in a state of flux"), while [[Gottfried Leibniz]] described a similar concept a century after Mulla Sadra's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Keven|last1=Brown|first2=Eberhard|last2=Von Kitzing|title=Evolution and Bahá'í Belief: ʻAbduʼl-Bahá's Response to Nineteenth-century Darwinism|publisher=Kalimat Press|isbn=1-890688-08-8|pages=222–3|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Vietnamese text}}

'''Trương Định''' (1820 – August 19, 1864), sometimes known as '''Trương Công Định''',  was a [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] in the [[Nguyễn dynasty]] of [[Vietnam]] under Emperor [[Tự Đức]]. He is best known for leading a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] army in southern Vietnam against the [[Conquest of Cochinchina|French invasion]] in defiance of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Nghia M. Vo ''Saigon: A History'' 2011 – Page 69 "The best known guerrilla fighter was Trương Định or Trương Công Định. Born in central Vietnam in 1820 or 1821, he moved to Gia Định with his father, a colonel in the royal army, who was transferred there."&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to recognise the 1862 [[Treaty of Saigon]] that ceded Vietnamese territory to France.

The son of a military mandarin from central Vietnam, Định moved south when his father was posted to [[Gia Định]] as the provincial commander. Định grew up to lead a military colony, overseeing the settlement and economic development of his constituency. He gained a reputation for being an able leader and land developer who cared for his people. When France began its invasion of southern Vietnam in 1859, Định organised local militia to reinforce the imperial army. As the regular army units suffered defeats on the battlefield, its remnants joined Định's partisans, and by 1861, he had around 6,000 men under his command. Định built his own resistance base and organised guerrilla attacks against the French. His success led Tự Đức to grant Định command of the southern partisans and to order the regular commanders to coordinate their plans with him. Định's forces quickly gained the respect of the French. They focused on disrupting the French bureaucracy and military posts in addition to the transportation of rice. Their most notable attack was the sinking of ''L'Espérance'' in December 1861.

Amid growing military setbacks, Vietnam signed the Treaty of Saigon in June 1862, losing three southern provinces which became the French colony of [[Cochinchina]]. Tự Đức hoped that by abiding by the treaty, Vietnam could eventually negotiate the future return of the territory. He ordered the partisans to disband, but Định refused to recognise the treaty and disobeyed the monarch, fighting on in defense of his homeland. With the loss of imperial support, Định's forces began to struggle against the superior resources of the French. His men were gradually worn down and, following an ambush, Định committed suicide to avoid being captured.

Vietnamese and French historians have fiercely debated Định's choice to disregard the treaty. The effectiveness of Định's insurgency led French officials to claim that Tự Đức was secretly assisting him, thereby violating the treaty, a pretext the French used to seize three more provinces in 1867. Vietnamese records dispute this, contending that Tự Đức attempted to ensure Định's compliance with the treaty. Định's defiance of the emperor has led historians to debate whether his actions were motivated by a rejection of the monarch's authority or whether he disobeyed in an attempt to help Tự Đức. Định remains widely respected among Vietnamese of all political persuasions. During the [[Vietnam War]], communist historians sought to portray the [[Viet Cong|Việt Cộng]] as Định's modern successor.

== Early years ==
Định was born in the [[Bình Sơn District]] in the [[Quảng Ngãi]] prefecture in [[Quảng Nam Province]] in central Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;At the time, Quảng Ngãi was a part of Quảng Nam.&lt;/ref&gt; The son of a military mandarin named Trương Cầm, Định went south in the 1830s when his father was posted to [[Gia Định]] as the provincial commander.&lt;ref name="n426"/&gt; Định enjoyed a reputation among the locals for his martial skills and knowledge of the military classics. He married the daughter of a wealthy resident of [[Tân An]] in nearby [[Dinh Tuong Province]], having moved there after his father's unexpected death. It was likely that he would have returned to central Vietnam if he had not married.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m91"&gt;McLeod, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Định took advantage of his improved socio-economic status to recruit a group of impoverished people, whom he organised for clearing land and founding a ''đồn điền'' ("military colony") in [[Gò Công]]. This occurred after Emperor Tự Đức's 1854 order, which granted General [[Nguyễn Tri Phương]] permission to organise southern levies in this manner. In recognition of his achievements, the mandarin authorities gave Định the rank of deputy regimental commander.&lt;ref name="m31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c121"&gt;Chapuis, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; His success in developing ''đồn điền'' was attributed to his organisational ability as well as a genuine concern for the welfare of those under his protection, ensuring that they had enough to eat and something to wear.&lt;ref name="m31"/&gt; He was regarded as energetic, brave and compassionate.&lt;ref name="n426"&gt;Nguyen, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; In gratitude for Định's land development skills, the peasants gave him the middle name '''Công''', which means "great public service".&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

== French invasion in 1859 ==
The process of Vietnam's colonisation began in September 1858 when a Franco-Spanish force landed at [[Da Nang]] in central Vietnam and attempted to proceed to the capital, [[Huế]].&lt;ref name="Chapuis, p. 48"&gt;Chapuis, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming tied down, they sailed to the less-defended south. The French and Spanish quickly captured the imperial [[Citadel of Saigon]] in February 1859—the fortress's commander committed suicide.&lt;ref name="m91"/&gt; The citadel was razed and the substantial supplies were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaderless and defeated imperial troops fled in disarray.&lt;ref name="m91"/&gt; The attacks were ordered by French Emperor [[Napoleon III]]. French diplomats, naval officers, merchants and missionaries had long advocated the expedition. The missionaries wanted the French administration to facilitate their work converting the Vietnamese to Roman Catholicism, while military and business figures saw commercial opportunities in Vietnam. Napoleon's motivations were primarily imperial, strategic and commercial, but he found it convenient to cite "freedom of religion" as his justification for taking action.&lt;ref name="m88"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A History of South-east Asia| first= D. G. E.|last=Hall |location=London| publisher=Macmillan|origyear=1955 |year=1981|page=647|isbn=0-333-24163-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= South East Asia: Its historical development| first= John F.|last=Cady | publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York |pages= 414–416| origyear=1964| year=1976|oclc=15002777}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nguyễn Dynasty was [[Confucian]]ist and had restricted the activity of missionaries. The belief system of Christianity was incompatible with the Confucian belief that the monarch was the "son of heaven".&lt;ref name="m88"&gt;McLeod, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the razing of the Citadel of Saigon,&lt;ref name="n267"&gt;Nguyen, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Định organised his local levies into a ''guerrilla'' force that initially numbered between 500 and 1000 men, operating out of [[Thuan Kieu]].&lt;ref name="m91"/&gt; They were armed with bladed spears, fire lances, knives, sabres, bamboo sticks and swords,&lt;ref name="m91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="n427"/&gt; trained and on call as necessary. As a local notable who was respected for his leadership and military ability, Định naturally assumed a lead role in the partisan movement that responded to Tự Đức's appeals for popular resistance against European aggression.&lt;ref name="m91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m31"&gt;Marr, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the initial phase of the conflict, the local militias concentrated on evacuating the populace from areas that had been taken over by the French, while urging those who chose to stay to not cooperate with the Europeans. Snipers were deployed into French areas to assassinate isolated soldiers.&lt;ref name="n267"/&gt;

In 1861, Định moved his men to [[Tân Hòa, Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu|Tân Hòa]] sub-prefecture in the [[Gò Công]] area.&lt;ref name="m91"/&gt; Tan Hoa was an ideal location for a resistance base. It was close to newly formed resistance groups led by [[Nguyễn Trung Trực]], [[Tran Xuan Hoa]] and others in the Gò Công and [[Mỹ Tho]] area, yet was also close to Saigon.&lt;ref name="m31"/&gt; In February, the French attacked the [[citadel of Ky Hoa]], seizing the fort after two days, along with a large quantity of weapons, artillery and food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Having fought at Ky Hoa,&lt;ref name="l11"/&gt; Định incorporated soldiers from the defeated imperial army into his ranks, because its commander [[Vo Duy Ninh]] had committed suicide.&lt;ref name="m91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c121" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1861, Admiral [[Léonard Charner]] ordered the dissolution of the ''đồn điền'' of Gò Công. He went about confiscating the land of those Vietnamese who remained loyal to the monarchy, giving it to his collaborators. French impositions against the trade of rice via nearby waterways caused a further backlash from the locals of Gò Công.&lt;ref name="n424"&gt;Nguyen, p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, the resistance leaders in the Gò Công area delegated Định to travel to [[Biên Hòa]] to seek permission from Imperial Military Commissioner [[Nguyen Ba Nghi]] to "turn around the situation".&lt;ref name="n427"&gt;Nguyen, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

Appointed to the rank of lieutenant colonel,&lt;ref name="c121"/&gt; Định began to stockpile foodstuffs, manufacture weapons, and recruit forces from the populace with the help of officers from the imperial army.&lt;ref name="m91"/&gt; His forces grew to around 6,000 men by June 1861. The French began to report that junks from [[Singapore]] and Hong Kong had arrived in Gò Công with shipments of European-made weapons.&lt;ref name="n427"/&gt; Định's forces began inflicting substantial damage on the European troops, largely because of their intimate knowledge of the terrain, skill in hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, and support from the local villagers.&lt;ref name="m92"/&gt; Định's men focused on chasing French soldiers around the countryside and attacking military installations that were left undefended as a consequence of their guerrilla pursuit.&lt;ref name="n430"&gt;Nguyen, p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning of Định's role in support of the Nguyễn dynasty's call for popular resistance, Tự Đức promoted him to the rank of lieutenant colonel for the Gia Định region. Later in 1861, the imperial regulars were defeated at [[Biên Hòa]],&lt;ref name="m92"/&gt; and the commanding Vietnamese officers were ordered by the royal authorities to meet Định at Tan Hoa to develop a plan for retaking Biên Hòa. As a result, the number of troops under Định's direct authority grew. Early in 1862, the Nguyễn court granted Định command of all the southern ''nghĩa quân'' (''righteous soldiers''), the term that Huế used for the partisans. Định continued to lead raids on enemy forces from his base in Gò Công.&lt;ref name="m92"/&gt; Friction developed between the regular army and Định's partisans as to whether to stage aggressive sorties from Tan Hoa, as was Định's strategy, or to bide their time and engage in military buildup.&lt;ref name="m32"/&gt;

Định's ''nghĩa quân'' quickly earned the respect of the opposing French naval officers. [[Léopold Pallu de la Barrière]], who defended the posts at Gò Công from Định's attacks, was surprised by their ferocity. Unaware of their nationalist feelings, de la Barrière had expected the Vietnamese to live submissively under any ruler that would allow them to sow their crops.&lt;ref name="m92"/&gt; He wrote:
{{quote|The attack on Gò Công by a group of armed, skillfully led men surprised everyone. We thought that the Annamites were still submerged in fear, that the masses were enslaved, cowardly, the dregs of empire ... incapable of any act of resistance.&lt;ref name="m92"&gt;McLeod, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He went on to recognise the popular nature of the partisans' efforts, stating that the "centre of resistance was everywhere, infinitely subdivided";&lt;ref name="m92"/&gt; he regarded every peasant as a centre of resistance.&lt;ref name="m92"/&gt;

== Notable attacks ==
[[Image:Nguyen Trung Truc portrait.jpg|left|[[Nguyễn Trung Trực]], one of Trương Định's assistants|thumb]]
From the middle of 1861, Định's Gò Công guerrillas focused on three objectives: to disrupt the newly created French bureaucracy, to disrupt their military outposts and to disrupt the transport of rice to [[Cholon]], the main commercial hub of southern Vietnam.&lt;ref name="n428"&gt;Nguyen, p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major attack against the French administration in the area targeted the Gò Công district office on June 22, 1861.&lt;ref name="n428"/&gt; At 05:00, 600 rebels under the command of [[Do Dinh Thoai]] stormed the military post in the town, engaging the French troops in hand-to-hand combat with lances, bayonets, knives and bamboo sticks. The French were surprised by the attack, losing one soldier and having 100 wounded.&lt;ref name="n428"/&gt; By the time reinforcements and naval cover had arrived from [[Mỹ Tho]], Định's men had fled.&lt;ref name="n429"/&gt; Thoai—who had been the district chief until the French invasion—was among the 14 killed.&lt;ref name="n427"/&gt;&lt;ref name="n429"&gt;Nguyen, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, the guerrillas assassinated the French-installed chief of Gò Công, displaying his severed head in the town market. The chief's servant, who was an informant for Định, aided this operation. The killing had the effect of intimidating the chief's designated successor into submitting to the rebels and ceasing his service for the French.&lt;ref name="n429"/&gt; In November 1861, Định's men went into the town of [[Mỹ Tho]] to recruit militants and collect food supplies. During this time, they attacked and burned pro-French villages and their leaders.&lt;ref name="n430" /&gt;

Định's Gò Công insurgents attempted to stop rice from being shipped to Cholon by attacking the French [[lorcha (boat)|lorchas]] and apprehending the trading vessels on the local waterways. A French report in November 1861 noted that shipping had been severely disrupted and restricted, despite high levels of French naval protection. The most notable of the seaborne attacks was the burning of the [[Lorcha (boat)|lorcha]] ''L'Espérance'' on [[Nhat Tao Canal]] on December 10, 1861.&lt;ref name="n431"&gt;Nguyen, p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 150 guerrillas commanded by Trực ambushed the vessel, killing some of the crew before burning and sinking the boat.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, pp. 432–433.&lt;/ref&gt; The attack buoyed Vietnamese morale and instilled the belief that they could fight against French naval forces. The sinking earned the specific praise of Emperor Tự Đức, who described the incident as "most outstanding".&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, pp. 433–434.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continued guerrilla campaign ==
[[Image:Phan Thanh Gian.jpg|thumb|right|Phan Thanh Giản]]

However, the overall Vietnamese military performance was not as successful as Định's guerrilla activities. On June 5, 1862, Định broke with the Nguyễn army after the court's plenipotentiary [[Phan Thanh Giản]] and another official, [[Lam Duy Hiep]], signed the [[Treaty of Saigon]]. This agreement ceded the three southern provinces of [[Gia Định Province|Gia Định]], [[Định Tường Province|Định Tường]] and [[Biên Hòa Province|Biên Hòa]] to France; they became the colony of [[Cochinchina]].&lt;ref name="m32"&gt;Marr, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty was accompanied by financial payments to France, religious concessions to missionaries and commercial opportunities for European merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis, pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Militarily, the withdrawal of the Nguyễn army deprived the resistance of the logistical support that could be provided by a regular force. It also permitted the French to concentrate their efforts against a single antagonist. Politically, the treaty provided, for those Vietnamese who needed one, a legal basis to collaborate with the French on Cochinchinese soil. As a result, the colonial forces found it easier to recruit militia and administrative personnel among Vietnamese who had been too afraid or too embarrassed to serve the French openly before the 1862 treaty.&lt;ref name="m93"&gt;McLeod, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Định then allied himself with [[Võ Duy Dương]] to form the [[Movement of Popular Self Defense]] (''Phong Trao Nhan Dan Tu Ve''), creating an operations base in [[Đồng Tháp Province|Đồng Tháp]].&lt;ref name="c121"/&gt;

The Huế court ordered Định to disband his forces and to accept a high position in [[An Giang Province]].&lt;ref name="c121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="l11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m32"/&gt; Fearing that they faced extermination at the hands of the French, Định's followers and lieutenants pressed him to remain. Claiming that his followers would not allow him to leave, Định refused his appointment to An Giang,&lt;ref name="m32"/&gt; instead adopting the title of ''Bình Tây Sát Tà Đại Tướng'' (''Western Pacifying Antiheresy General''). He continued his guerrilla attacks against French patrols and their Vietnamese collaborators. The slogan "Phan-Lâm mái quốc; Triều đình khi dân" (''Phan [Thanh Gian] and Lam [Duy Hiep] sell out the country; the court doesn’t care for the people'') was circulated through the region.&lt;ref name="m32"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lam, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; From his stronghold at [[Gò Công]], Định exhorted all southern Vietnamese to rise against the occupying regime, an appeal that was well received. In the words of French naval artillery officer Henri de Poyen, by December 1862, "the insurrection had broken out and was rapidly spreading throughout the colony".&lt;ref name="m32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m93"/&gt; French commanders were convinced that Định remained in secret contact with Huế and was privately supported by Tự Đức against the terms of the treaty. The French charged that Định possessed a seal of office from Huế.&lt;ref name="m32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m93"/&gt; However, there were reports that Tự Đức had twice ordered the arrest of Định and Dương to ensure their compliance with the treaty.&lt;ref name="c122"/&gt;

In contrast with many of his scholar-gentry colleagues who lacked a military training, Định was regarded as having a good understanding of the capabilities and limitations of his armed resistance. Định hoped to wear down the French over an extended period by exploiting the constant outbreak of [[malaria]] among the Europeans.&lt;ref name="m33"/&gt; During the initial phase of the invasion in 1858, the French had suffered heavily from tropical disease.&lt;ref name="Chapuis, p. 48"/&gt; Định calculated that such illnesses would partly compensate for the inferior weaponry of his forces. He attempted to maintain an administration parallel to the one imposed on the districts by the French admirals. These objectives required a high degree of regional coordination, something that was impossible without the support of the imperial bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="m33"&gt;Marr, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Định's appeal among the peasantry was attributed to their gratitude for his administration of the ''đồn điền''. Under such a system, he was responsible for assisting them in matters such as clearing land, educating the community, providing health care and mediating disputes. Joining the resistance army was seen as a means of showing trust and gratitude.&lt;ref name="n406"&gt;Nguyen, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hịch Trương Định'' (''The proclamation of Trương Định''), which was believed to have been written in 1862 or 1863, emphasised such themes.&lt;ref name="n406"/&gt; It read:

== Death ==
By February 1864, Admiral Bonard had accumulated sufficient reinforcements to attack and seize Định's main strongholds in the Tan Hoa and Gò Công areas. He inflicted heavy casualties on the partisans and forced them to retreat in disarray. Định reorganised his troops and procured more firearms from the local Chinese in order to resume his guerrilla campaign. He attempted to widen his support base by distributing leaflets as far as the regional centres of [[Saigon]] and [[Mỹ Tho]], calling on ''nghĩa quân'' from other provinces to join the common struggle.&lt;ref name="m33"/&gt; By this time, the French were able to keep Định and the other resistance leaders constantly on the move, aided by a growing network of local informants. In 1863, a famine had broken out, and resistance forces were increasingly unable to find food. With the court providing no practical support, the French gradually wore down the partisans. Định retreated into the marshes of Bien Hoa, where he attempted to reorganise his forces.

On August 19, 1864, with his remaining guerrillas facing serious supply problems and suffering from hunger, Định was betrayed by a former follower and ambushed by French forces. Wounded and facing imminent capture, Định committed suicide.&lt;ref name="c122"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m34"/&gt; His 20-year-old son Truong Quyen (1840–1870), attempted with modest success to carry on his father's struggle. A new base was set up in [[Tây Ninh]]. It allowed more room for tactical manoeuvring but still depended on supplies being carried north from Tan Hoa.&lt;ref name="m34"&gt;Marr, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Quyen was eventually killed and in 1874, long after the southern insurgency had been crushed, Tự Đức granted a monthly allowance in grain and cash to Định's widow Le Thi Thuong, who had returned to her native village in [[Quảng Ngãi]], which at the time was still in independent Vietnamese territory.&lt;ref name="m34"/&gt; The ration of 20 francs and 60 litres of rice was substantial,&lt;ref name="c122"&gt;Chapuis, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; because the monthly salary of a ninth-rank mandarin was only 18 francs and 48 litres of rice.&lt;ref name="c135"&gt;Chapuis, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defiance of Huế? ==
The actions of Định in the wake of the [[Treaty of Saigon]] have long been a subject of conjecture. At the time, the French military accused Huế of surreptitiously supporting Định in contravention of the treaty, while Huế denied this, publicly claiming that Định's actions in resisting the French would be counterproductive in attempting to maintain Vietnamese sovereignty.&lt;ref name="c121"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the signing of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court attempted to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought a reversal of the territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty.&lt;ref name="m90"/&gt; In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces.&lt;ref name="c301"&gt;Chapuis, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="k90"&gt;Karnow, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.&lt;ref name="c301"/&gt;&lt;ref name="k90"/&gt;

Tự Đức continued to hope that Vietnamese compliance with the treaty would convince France to return the three southern provinces. In the words of Gian, Vietnam's full cooperation with the 1862 treaty was necessary to maintain the possibility of a territorial retrocession. The French officers in Saigon, the capital of Cochinchina, frequently accused the Nguyễn court of violating the treaty by quietly supporting continued resistance. In 1867, they took this as a pretext to seize the other three provinces in southern Vietnam: [[Vĩnh Long Province|Vĩnh Long]], [[Hà Tiên Province|Hà Tiên]] and [[An Giang Province|An Giang]].&lt;ref name="c122"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="k90"/&gt;

The court records of the Nguyễn dynasty in Huế, the ''[[Đại Nam thực lục]]'' (''Veritable Records of the Great South'') dispute the French claims, revealing that the court attempted to prevent illegal guerrilla activity by the likes of Định.&lt;ref name="m90"&gt;McLeod, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in one edict, Định claimed that Tự Đức endorsed his struggle, in an attempt to garner popular support. This fuelled French claims that the guerrillas were periodically traveling between French territory and the adjoining sovereign Nguyễn territory to get supplies from provincial officials.&lt;ref name="m90"/&gt;

The French officers never produced concrete proof of Huế's support for the southern partisans or of the connivance of Vietnamese officials in the sovereign provinces bordering French-occupied territory. Despite this, they seized the rest of southern Vietnam on the basis that Huế was violating the treaty. Vice-Admiral Bonard, governor of French Cochinchina from 1861 until 1863, asserted:

{{quote|There is no disguising the fact that the peace stipulated by the Treaty [of 1862] has never been faithfully executed by the Huế court. Seeing that it could not withstand a conventional war, the Annamite government organised, openly before the peace, clandestinely and underhandedly afterward, a permanent insurrection in Cochin China.... Quan Dinh [Mandarin Dinh], head of the insurrection at Gò Công, although publicly disavowed by the viceroy of [[Vĩnh Long]] Phan Thanh Gian, who has called on him several times to withdraw so that the peace treaty can be implemented, has absolutely refused to do so. He is thus apparently in a state of rebellion, but the Huế government, which has publicly given him orders that he has disobeyed, supports him clandestinely and supplies him with arms, munitions, and seals.&lt;ref name="m94"&gt;McLeod, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historians sympathetic to the colonisation reiterated the officers' assertions about the contacts between Huế and the southern partisans. De Poyen wrote that the southern insurgency "was ceaselessly excited and supported by emissaries from Huế, who travelled throughout the country".&lt;ref name="m94"/&gt; Milton Osborne, while noting that evidence was circumstantial, asserted that French charges were probably legitimate:&lt;ref name="m94"/&gt;

{{quote|The scale of the risings in December 1862 certainly suggests an organised concerted effort, backed by Huế. This judgment, however, is based on inference, not on certain fact. After the failure of the 1862 risings, Huế had little active part in the repeated risings in the South.... Noninvolvement in practical ways did not mean the end of interest, and there seems some reason to accept the French allegations that the sporadic risings against their control of Cochinchina received the clandestine approval of Huế for many years.&lt;ref name="m94"/&gt;}}

Vietnamese documentation challenges the French assertions. The imperial records, written communications between Gian and Định, and the account of the southern insurgency written by a resistance figure named [[Nguyen Thong]] support the contention that Định's guerrillas operated independently of Huế and in violation of its orders. The imperial records hold that Tự Đức immediately ordered the insurgents to disband, fearing that their actions were an obstacle to his plan of negotiating the return of the lost territory. The records assert that Tự Đức ordered his officials to prevent the insurgents from returning to independent Vietnamese land and to arrest those who did so. Messengers were sent from Huế into the south with the intention of discouraging the insurgents, rather than fomenting resistance.&lt;ref name="m95"&gt;McLeod, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of Định, the Vietnamese documents record the failed attempts of Gian to persuade him to lay down his arms and accept an administrative post in An Giang. The records assert that his position as head of the resistance was granted by his followers rather than Huế.&lt;ref name="m96"&gt;McLeod, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after signing the treaty, the court directed Gian to write to Định, ordering him to respect the agreement and end his resistance. Gian's letter and Định's rebuff show Tự Đức's insistence on abiding by the treaty and the guerrilla chief's staunch refusal to do so. Gian's letter argued that it was illegal and futile to ignore the court's order to cease hostilities. Gian wrote:&lt;ref name="m96"/&gt;

{{quote|Since the court has signed the peace treaty, you should cease hostilities and not violate the king's orders.... At present, the court's regular forces have all been withdrawn, and the mandarins commanding troops hiding in the mountains and forests have all disbanded their forces. If you alone are to lead your soldiers to the attack, can you be certain of victory? If you retreat, can you defend yourself? Certainly not!&lt;ref name="m96"/&gt;}}

In his reply, Định demonstrated his awareness of the illegality of his insurgency and the southerners' obligation to obey their emperor. Định nevertheless refused to abandon his supporters, vowing to disobey royal orders:&lt;ref name="m96"/&gt;

{{quote|The people of the three provinces, wanting to return to their former status, designated me as their leader. Therefore, we cannot take any course but our present one.... If Your Excellency still maintains that the agreements with the invaders must be preserved, then we will oppose the court's commands, and ... there can be no more peace or truce between us and Your Excellency.&lt;ref name="c122"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m96"/&gt;}}

Vietnamese records show that when Định disobeyed the court's orders, he was stripped of his position and titles:&lt;ref name="m97"&gt;McLeod, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; "Trương Định has refused to return to the exercise of his office, and he is accordingly removed from that function with loss of honorific titles."&lt;ref name="m97"/&gt; Nguyen Thong, a former mandarin who fought alongside Định and corresponded with many other guerrilla leaders, agreed with the court records. According to Thong, Định's continued resistance resulted from local initiatives contrary to Huế's explicit instructions. Định's supporters implored him to disobey the edicts of 1862 that directed the partisans to end hostilities:&lt;ref name="m97"/&gt; "Our people forced the Westerners to retreat many times, and now that the court has made peace with them, they will surely kill us.... Since the court has settled with them, who will support us? Let us unite to strike back at them, to take for ourselves a piece of land on which we can fight for our lives."&lt;ref name="m97"/&gt;

According to Thong's account, Định agreed with these arguments and began to organise the resources required for his unapproved anti-French movement. Although he was fully aware of his imperial defiance, Định sent an appeal "to all the righteous men, encouraging them in the name of loyalty to the court to rise and destroy the invaders".&lt;ref name="m97"/&gt; Thong asserted that the imperial edicts used by Định—which were cited by French officers for subsequent aggression—were fake. Định had falsified them to make propaganda in order to rally popular support.&lt;ref name="m97"/&gt; According to Mark McLeod, it is unclear whether hawkish mandarins in the imperial court were assisting Định's southern insurgents in contravention of Tự Đức's wishes.&lt;ref name="m98"&gt;McLeod, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Truong Buu Lam opined that "if some partisans received assistance from the Vietnamese authorities, it was extended to them by local officials who acted independently".&lt;ref name="l9"&gt;Lam, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disrespect of the mandate of heaven? ==
In light of Định's disobedience of Tự Đức, his justification for his defiance is discussed against the backdrop of the Confucian expectation for him to defer to the emperor's "[[Mandate of Heaven]]". As Định left no explicit or definitive statement for his rationale for disobeying Tự Đức, scholars who have recognised or suspected Định's disobedience have been forced to speculate.&lt;ref name="m98"/&gt;

Lam assumes Định's disobedience and explains it by asserting that the insurgents drew a distinction between the reigning monarch and the monarchy as an idealised institution.&lt;ref name="m98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="l10"&gt;Lam, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|After the Huế court signed the Treaty of Saigon, a moral dilemma developed since the partisans could neither accept the loss of their country nor claim that their cause was righteous if they acted in violation of the court's orders. They therefore drew a careful distinction between the person of an individual king and the moral principle of loyalty to the monarchy.... The monarchy was therefore an idealised institution not tarnished by any accidental deviation from the ideal.&lt;ref name="l10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m99"/&gt;}}

The historian [[David G. Marr|David Marr]] agrees, noting that "the distinction quite rightly pointed out by Professor Truong Buu Lam was in all probability bred of immediate adverse conditions and not the product of a long tradition".&lt;ref name="m32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m99"&gt;McLeod, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Vietnamese historians of the communist regime go to the extent of asserting that Định's justification for continued resistance was based on an implicit rejection of the monarchy at large. These historians base their hypothesis on the assertion that the Confucian virtue of monarchical loyalty was unconditional and absolute in 19th-century Vietnam. In the words of the editors of the [[Institute of Historical Study]]'s journal, ''[[Nghiên cứu lịch sử]]'' (''Historical Studies''), "Loyalty to the king was the people's duty, and to satisfy the obligation of monarchical loyalty, the court's orders had to be followed".&lt;ref name="m100"/&gt; In the view of Marxist authors, Định resolved the conflict between monarchical loyalty and resisting foreign occupation by discarding the constraints of Confucian ethics. They assert that Định justified his struggle by placing loyalty to Tự Đức below his loyalty to Vietnam and its people. The Institute of Historical Study's [[Nguyen Cong Binh]] stated, "Relying on the people, Trương Định placed the country above the king, thus safeguarding his feelings of loyalty to the country".&lt;ref name="m100"/&gt; These arguments are consistent with Marxist ideology and its criticism of the Nguyễn dynasty as a "reactionary, feudal regime".&lt;ref name="l13"/&gt; Communist party historiography has long criticised the Nguyễn dynasty and its roots in the [[Nguyễn lords]] for the division of the country in the centuries-long struggle with the [[Trịnh lords]] of the north and then the subsequent use of French aid of [[Pigneau de Behaine]] to unseat the [[Tây Sơn dynasty]]. It further accords with Hanoi's ideological line of portraying anti-colonial, anti-French fighters of the 19th century as the spiritual ancestors of the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="m100"&gt;McLeod, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="l13"&gt;Li, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Mark McLeod, these postulated explanations of Định's behaviour are plausible, given the chaos engulfing Vietnam at the time and the lack of conclusive documentation. However, Định and his supporters asserted their loyalty to the monarch and justified their struggle in his name, both before and after the signing of the treaty. These declarations show no hint of rejecting Tự Đức's authority nor any reference to a worthier, idealised monarch. Conversely, many of these proclamations display an intense feeling of personal loyalty. A placard that French forces found floating downstream near Định's base in Gò Công asserted:&lt;ref name="m101"&gt;McLeod, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; "Gratitude ties us to our king. We will avenge the insults he has received [from the French], or we will die for him."&lt;ref name="m101"/&gt; One of Định's proclamations to his followers read:&lt;ref name="m101"/&gt; "The Emperor does not recognise us, but it is indeed our duty to carry on our struggle.... The Emperor calls us rebels, but in the depth of his heart he cannot help but praise our loyalty. When the day of victory arrives, not only will the Emperor forgive us, he will furthermore grant us all kinds of awards."&lt;ref name="m101"/&gt;
&lt;!--[[Image:Tu Duc.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Tự Đức]]--&gt;

Such writings may be dismissed by skeptics as a political stunt aimed at attracting support for continued resistance by appealing to the widely held Confucian value of monarchical loyalty. This is the explanation suggested by the Marxist authors: "On the one hand, Trương Định opposed Tự Đức's order to lay down his arms; on the other hand, he exploited Tự Đức's name in order to call upon the people to rise and fight the French".&lt;ref name="m101"/&gt; McLeod argues that the best explanation for Định's continued insurgency was that the Confucian tradition allows for a loyal official to disobey his sovereign without calling the sovereign's authority into question. This is termed a ''tránh thần'', meaning a minister who is willing to dispute his sovereign's orders in order to prevent the ruler from committing a mistake, even if this incurred his ire. The minister who allowed the ruler to err rather than risk upsetting him was regarded as a sycophant, a careerist rather a loyal adviser. The loyal official was thus required in certain circumstances to remonstrate with and even to disobey his sovereign to show his concern for the monarch. Thus, according to McLeod, Định's disobedience did not ''ipso facto'' constitute a rejection of Tự Đức's authority.&lt;ref name="m101"/&gt;

Định believed that Tự Đức would eventually realise his error and reward the insurgents. Historians feel that it is likely that Gian and Tự Đức saw Định's continued resistance as a misguided attempt to help the monarchy. In their written confrontation after the signing of the treaty, Gian did not accuse Định of being a rebel, but of excessive devotion to the emperor, which while admirable in principle, was hindering their current strategy. "Monarchical loyalty is a noble quality", Gian had told the recalcitrant guerrilla leader,&lt;ref name="m103"/&gt; but "[i]t must have a limit. One cannot exceed this limit and still be faithful and pious. Too much is just as bad as not enough; when a snake begins to have legs, it is no longer a snake..."&lt;ref name="m103"&gt;McLeod, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Tự Đức also appeared to view Định's continued resistance as a misguided manifestation of loyalty. Although the southern insurgents' disobedience provided the French with a pretext for further aggression, thereby hindering Tự Đức's plans for regaining the lost territory, the emperor never accused them of rebelling against royal authority. Instead, he continued to refer to them as "righteous recruits" motivated by "indignation" at the actions of the Westerners.&lt;ref name="m103"/&gt;

[[Nguyễn Đình Chiểu]], the leading poet of the southern struggle, did not portray Định as a rebel opposed to the Huế court. In an [[elegy]] to fallen insurgents, Chiểu asserted that the resistance continued its struggle after the treaty was signed "because their hearts would not heed the Son of Heaven's edict".&lt;ref name="m104"/&gt; Chiểu strongly supported the partisans' continuing efforts in attempting to expel the French from southern Vietnam, a cause he considered righteous. However, his reference to Tự Đức as the "Son of Heaven" indicates that the legitimacy of the emperor was not called into question.&lt;ref name="m104"&gt;McLeod, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; After Định's death, Chiểu wrote in a poem:&lt;ref name="l11"&gt;Lam, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|You have spared no efforts to help your country,&lt;br&gt;
Although you disobeyed the royal orders, you shall not be considered a disloyal subject.&lt;ref name="l11"/&gt;}}

Chiểu further hoped that the Vietnamese court would change its position and come to the aid of the insurgents, writing:&lt;ref name="l9"/&gt; "The sigh of the wind and the cry of the crane [announcing the official army's arrival] held you breathless for more than ten months. You were expecting news from the officials as one expects rain in the dry season."&lt;ref name="l9"/&gt;

The reputation of Định and his southern rebels persisted long after his death. [[Phan Bội Châu]], the leading Vietnamese revolutionary of the early 20th century, travelled into the south in 1904, seeking to start a new anti-French movement. He specifically attempted to recruit followers among the surviving elderly members of Định's movement.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Định was highly regarded as a revolutionary hero by Vietnamese of both communist and anti-communist persuasions. In 1964, an article in the North Vietnamese ''Nghiên cứu lịch sửu'' described Định as "the hero symbolising the spirit of resistance to the foreign colonialists of the people of Southern Viet-Nam".&lt;ref name="os"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nv"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mai-Hanh |date=August 1964 |title=Trương Định |journal=[[Nghiên cứu lịch sử]] |volume=66 |page=59 |language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same article extolled Định's physical appearance and his capabilities, stating "He was handsome in appearance, understood the military manual and was a good shot".&lt;ref name="os"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nv"/&gt; During the [[Vietnam War]] era, North Vietnamese historians sought to portray the [[Viet Cong]]—which fought against the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] and the United States—as Định's modern successor.&lt;ref name="os"/&gt; Định was also highly regarded among anti-communist South Vietnamese scholars.&lt;ref name="os"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Milton E. |last=Osborne |date=November 1970 |title=Truong Vinh Ky and Phan Thanh Gian: The Problem of a Nationalist Interpretation of 19th Century Vietnamese History |journal=[[Journal of Asian Studies]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |page=85 |doi=10.2307/2942724 |jstor=2942724}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent thoroughfare in the centre of [[Ho Chi Minh City]] in southern Vietnam is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Vietnam Country Map |publisher=Periplus Travel Maps |year=2002–03 |isbn=0-7946-0070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Định received little attention in French academia, the North Vietnamese heavily relied on French sources for their accounts of the guerrilla leader. In the most detailed French account by Paulin Vial, Định is depicted as a "criminal" or "rebel".&lt;ref name="os"/&gt; Osborne said that Định's final manifesto before his death showed him "to have been a man with a high concept of duty, an awareness of his own weakness and with a sense of despair, common to many of his countrymen, at the ambivalence of the Huế court".&lt;ref name="os"/&gt;

'''Vegetarian ecofeminism''' is an activist and academic movement&lt;ref&gt;''Lois Ann Lorentzen, University of San Francisco, and Heather Eaton, Saint Paul University (2002)''&lt;/ref&gt; which states that all types of [[oppression]] are linked and must be eradicated, with a focus on including the domination of humans over nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Through the feminist concept known as [[intersectionality]], it is recognized that [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[classism]], and other forms of inter human oppression are all connected. Vegetarian ecofeminism aims to include the domination of not only the environment but also of nonhuman animals to the list.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gaard, Greta. "Vegetarian Ecofeminism: A Review Essay." Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies. ( 2002): 117-146. Web. 2 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminism is part of the academic and philosophical field of [[ecofeminism]], which states that the ways in which the privileged dominates the oppressed should include the way humans dominate nature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Adams | first1=Carol | year=1991| title=Ecofeminism and the Eating of Animals | doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1991.tb00213.x | journal=Hypatia | volume=1991 | issue=| pages=125–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major theme within ecofeminism is the belief that there is a strong connection between the domination of women and the domination of nature, and that both must be eradicated in order to end oppression.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Vegetarian ecofeminism extends beyond ecofeminism because it believes that the way in which humans exploit and kill nonhuman animals should be distinctly recognized, and that the oppression of humans is linked to the oppression of nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The concept of [[speciesism]] is central to distinguishing between vegetarian ecofeminism and ecofeminism, and it strongly links the [[hierarchies]] created among nonhuman animals to the hierarchies created among humans.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Distinguishing between ecofeminism and vegetarian ecofeminism is important because of vegetarian ecofeminism's focus on the oppression of nonhuman animals provides connections between the other linked forms of oppression, but specifically the oppression of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a4443d40-b53a-427f-98dd-533f23a76bdf%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=104|title=Linking Sexism and Speciesism|last=Wyckoff|first=Jason|date=1 September 2014|journal=Hypatia|pages=n/a|doi=10.1111/hypa.12098 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speciesism==
{{Main|Speciesism}}
Speciesism is a form of oppression central to the ecofeminist concept,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and the belief that speciesism is a valid form of oppression that must be eradicated is at the center of most vegetarian ecofeminist arguments. It is used to support the exploitation and killing of nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Much like any other form of oppression, speciesism is a social construction that benefits the dominant at the expense of the oppressed.

===Humanism in opposition to vegetarian ecofeminism===
[[Humanist]]s believe that speciesism is not a "bad -ism" like racism or sexism, because while women, people of color, and any other group of oppressed humans are moral humans, nonhuman animals are not and therefore do not deserve the same rights.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Against "Humanism": Speciesism, Personhood, and Preference|last=Cushing|first=Simon|date=2003|journal=Journal of Social Philosophy|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to humanism, the domination of humans over animals is justified, and animals are indeed meant for human [[Consumer (food chain)|consumption]].&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Human rights are inherently more important than animal rights because their biological differences from human makes them morally different as well.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Vegetarian ecofeminists argue that there is an inherent bond between humans and nonhuman animals, and the human supremacy and degradation of animals that ensues is a [[Social constructionism|social construction]] meant to undermine the human-animal bond.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Luke | first1=Brian | year=| title=Justice, Caring, and Animal Liberation | url=| journal=Animals and Women | volume=1992 | issue=| pages=81–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in fact not the characteristic of an abnormal few who care and empathize with nonhuman animals, but the normal state for most humans.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; This is exemplified by the cross-cultural practice of pet-keeping or the usage of animals in therapy, which demonstrate the strength of the bond between humans and animals.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The act of [[expiation]] in which humans justify the act of killing nonhuman animals shows that humans are inclined not to harm animals, otherwise there would not need to be any mechanisms created cross-culturally to help deal with the guilt felt in killing animals.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

===Hierarchies===
The hierarchy created among nonhuman animals validates the hierarchies created among humans. Humans identify more closely with nonhuman animals that have human characteristics, and this allows for humans to create a hierarchy that places nonhuman that humans are able to identify more closely with at the top, and those it shares less characteristics with at the bottom.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Humans have evolved to sympathize with beings similar to themselves.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; This allows humans to justify the killing of certain animals over others, because due to the hierarchy humans have created, some animals are of lesser value and therefore have fewer rights. For example, Western cultures kill cows, chickens, and fish for consumption, but find it morally wrong to kill lions, dogs, and dolphins. That is because Western moral values find connections between humans and lions, dogs, and dolphins, but do not find connections between cows, chickens, and fish, and therefore value certain species' lives over others. Which species are valued over others differs depending on culture, country, religion, etc., as can be seen in the fact that it is socially acceptable to eat dogs in many Asian cultures, but is seen as morally corrupt in most Western cultures. The lack of a universal hierarchy for nonhuman animals shows that it is a social construction created to benefit humans.

Vegetarian ecofeminism argues that the killing of any animal is part of a larger system of oppression, and that instead of choosing one animal over another, or a human over a nonhuman animal, humans should care about all oppressed subjects and should be invested in ending each subject's oppression, so as to end the oppression of all beings. The creation of hierarchies in nonhuman animals can also rapidly become the creation of hierarchies in humans, and thus one can once again observe how speciesism is linked to racism, classism, sexism, and other forms of oppression.

Vegetarian ecofeminism asserts that as long as "humans are violent toward animals, they often are violent toward one another" and this "vicious circle of violence and destruction can end only if and when the human species learns to form harmonious relations – non-hierarchical and non-exploitative – with other animal species and the natural world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Best|first=S.|year=2006|title=Rethinking Revolution: Animal Liberation, Human Liberation, and the Future of the Left|url=|journal=Journal of Inclusive Democracy|volume=2 |issue=3|pages=1–28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vegetarianism==
Vegetarian ecofeminism argues that the oppression of nonhuman animals and the oppression of women are closely linked, so vegetarian ecofeminism argues that eating meat makes one complicit in the exploitation of animals. It also makes one complicit in the violence towards animals and women, for "meat-eating is a form of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] domination ... that suggests a link between male violence and a meat-based diet".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The phrase "the personal is political" is deeply embedded in ecofeminism, because just as it is hypocritical for feminists to buy products created in [[sweatshop]]s, it is hypocritical for feminists to buy products produced by factory farming.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Feminist]]s recognize that buying and consuming these products, whether they are clothes made by a woman denied her [[Human rights in Cambodia]] or meat from a cow whose rights as a nonhuman animal were violated until it was killed, is an act of support to sweatshops and factory farming, but also to the larger patriarchal system at play.

It is also noted that vegetarianism can be a means to protest violence of all kinds because it believes that "animals and humans suffer and die alike. Violence causes the same pain, the same spilling of blood, the same stench of death, the same arrogant, cruel and brutal taking of life."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Vegetarianism is therefore a way that ecofeminists can embody their beliefs, because eating meat directly supports the domination of humans over nonhumans, speciesism, and the creation of hierarchies. Or in other words, "the fact that our meat-advocating culture has successfully separated the consequence of eating animals from the experience of eating animals".&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Neal. 1990. The evolution of the human diet. ''In The power of your plate''. Summertown TN: Book Publishing Co. Web. 11 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The dairy industry acquires revenue via artificial insemination and the consequential lactating of female bodies. When their calf is born, the newborn is immediately taken from their mother. If they are a male calf, they are destined to be sold to the veal or beef industry. If they are a female calf, they are destined to live the same dairy cow life as their mothers. Vegetarians are able to empathize with nonhuman animals and reject the notion of speciesism, and their diets reflect their beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminists do the same but connect it to the larger picture of systematic oppression, and recognize that the only way that humans are able to justify their oppression of animals is to discredit the empathy and sympathy felt for nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Link between sexism and speciesism==
While the goal of vegetarian ecofeminism is to end all oppression, it does focus on the connections between the oppression of nonhuman animals and the oppression of women. Both are [[Objectification|objectified]] by men within the dominate discourse of the patriarchy, though in different ways: women are seen as sex objects and nonhuman animals are seen as food.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In both instances, both beings are considered to be less than men, and therefore are able to be used, abused, and consumed by those with more privilege.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; There are often [[essentialist]]ic and empathetic connections made between human mothers and nonhuman mothers, and ecofeminist scholar Carol Adams exemplifies this when she states "As a lactating mother, I empathize with the sow whose reproductive freedoms have been denied and whose nursing experience seems so wretched."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Generalizing women as mothers is problematic because not all women identify as mothers, yet there often is a strong link made between women and nonhuman animals due to their shared experience and oppression as mothers.

The egg, veal, and dairy industry directly profits from exploiting the reproductive system of female non-human animals. Similarly, many industries profit from objectifying, dominating, and consuming female human bodies. The advertising industry often objectifies women's bodies, as something to be dominated and consumed. Adams asserts that the culturally accepted belief that animal bodies are "disposable objects for fun or eating" emboldens the acceptance of "heterosexuality as normative and the idea that pleasuring men is women's work".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Carol J.|year=2017|title=The Poetics of Christian Engagement: Living Compassionately in a Sexual Politics of Meat World|url=|journal=Studies in Christian Ethics|volume=30.1|pages=45–59|via=|doi=10.1177/0953946816674148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linking sexism and speciesism through language===
Women are often objectified by being compared to a piece of meat or [[Dehumanization|dehumanized]] by being called a 'cow' or a 'bird'.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; There is indeed a history of dehumanization through equating humans to animals, which because of speciesism, means that they are devalued and considered to be less than other valued humans.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This is often seen in cases of [[genocide]], for in Rwanda the Tutsi were compared to cockroaches for many months leading up to the actual genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, C. J. 2006. The War on Compassion. In J. Donovan and C. J. Adams (eds) The Feminist Care Tradition in Animal Ethics. New York: Columbia University Press, 2007, pp.21–38&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing humans as animals makes it easier to oppress them, and thus it is once again clear that in order to end the oppression of humans, one must also work to end the oppression of nonhuman animals, because so long as nonhuman animals are viewed as inherently inferior to humans, dehumanization will continue to be justified with comparisons to nonhuman animals.

==Morality and ethics==
Sympathy towards nonhuman animals and recognizing that the same dominant power is abusing all of the oppressed is essential to ending all oppression because "humans have an innate sense of sympathy and that this is the basis for moral awareness",&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Donovan | first1=Josephine | year=1990| title=Animal Rights and Feminist Theory | doi=10.1086/494588 | journal=Signs | volume=15 | issue=2| pages=350–375 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore able to make the moral and sympathetic connections between human experiences and nonhuman experiences.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; These can include the connection mothers will feel to cows being exploited for their milk, or the understanding among "people of color, women, gays, and lesbians [who] all know the experience of being hunted-of being "prey" in Western culture."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminists argue that as feminists, those who recognize the domination of the patriarchal power, should also recognize the way in which it dominates and objectifies nonhuman animals, and should therefore feel a moral obligation to end not only women's oppression, but animals' oppression as well.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

===Need for justification when harming nonhuman animals===
Harming animals goes against humans' natural instincts, and language is used to hide the harm humans cause nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; In farming, the act of killing a nonhuman animal is not known as "slaughter" but as "termination" or "meat-packing" and the animals themselves are referred to as "livestock". This terminology prevents sympathy, through disconnecting the living animal from the product, and by masking the harm done to these nonhuman animals by humans.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Another justification for exploiting and harming animals is that it is a necessary function in order for humans to survive. This is supported by the discourse that humans must consume meat and eggs in order to be healthy, or that animal testing must be used to advance medicine.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; So while humans are naturally empathetic and caring to nonhuman animals, there are a great deal of obstacles created by "the substantial power of institutionalized animal exploitation [that] sustain ignorance, promote fear, reward cruelty, and punish kindness."&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; These obstacles are deeply ingrained in many societies and thus social justice for nonhuman animals is often difficult to obtain.

==The feminist–vegetarian connection==
''The feminist–vegetarian connection'' first appeared in Sheri Lucas' "A Defense of the Feminist-Vegetarian Connection", a response to Kathryn Paxton George's book ''Animal, Vegetable, or Woman? A Feminist Critique of Ethical Vegetarianism (2000)''. The feminist–vegetarian connection is a concept indicating that the oppression of animals in the form of being slaughtered and consumed is parallel to the oppression of women in a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], which establishes a connection between feminism and vegetarianism.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Sheri|year=2005|title=A defense of the Feminist-Vegetarian Connection|url=|journal=Hypatia|volume=20|pages=150–177|doi=10.1353/hyp.2005.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carol. J. Adams first published on this topic in 1975.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; However, this topic was mentioned in 'few publications' for ten years afterwards.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; The lack of acknowledgment on this topic in the 1980s became a concern amongst feminists and, eventually, triggered the formation of an 'Ecofeminist Task Force' in 1990, raising awareness on the feminist–vegetarian connection.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; After 1990, this connection was extensively analysed in articles and journals by numerous scholars such as [[Josephine Donovan]] and Kathryn Paxton George.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

==Voices in opposition to the feminist–vegetarian connection==

===Health of men and women on vegetarian and vegan diets===
In ''Animal, Vegetable, or Woman,'' Kathryn Paxton George invalidates the oppression of nonhuman animals, which is "inconsistent with feminism or antithetical to its goals" in her opinion.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; George argues in her essay "Should Feminists be Vegetarians" that "these traditional arguments for ethical vegetarianism cannot be assimilated into a feminist ethic. Correlatively, limited consumption of animal products and, in some cases, meat is consistent with a feminist ethic".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=George|first=Kathryn Paxton|year=1994|title=Should Feminists Be Vegetarians?|url=|journal=Signs|volume=19|issue=2|pages=405–434|doi=10.1086/494889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George's stance is based on human beings' physiology that conditions male to be more likely to succeed on a vegetarian diet than female.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; According to George, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet poses risks on "people identifiable by characteristics over which they have no choice or control: infants, children, adolescents, gestating or lactating women, some elderly people, and many people living in cultural and environmental circumstances that are not dependent on industrialized agriculture and high-tech society".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Based on George's scientific research, she discovered that women and children "are more vulnerable to deficiencies of certain vitamins and minerals".&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feministcurrent.com/2011/12/18/should-feminists-be-vegetarian/|title=PODCAST: Should Feminists be Vegetarians?|last=Murphy|first=Meghan|date=18 December 2011|website=Feminist Current|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially children who adopt a vegan diet "may lack sufficient quantities of vitamin D and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, iron, calcium, and zinc".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Vegan women may face the risk of being diagnosed with osteoporosis as a result of adopting diets that are low in calcium.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; George claims that "milk is still recommended as the best source of calcium" as calcium in plants "either comes in a form the body cannot use very well or occurs in the presence of other compounds (such as phytates, fiber, cellulose, uronic acids, and oxalates in the case of calcium) that prevent its use".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Furthermore, lactating and gestating women may be at 'greater nutritional risk' which may negatively influence the health of the fetus or infant.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In addition, George claims that "even [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|lacto-ovovegetarian]] diet poses some risks".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Along with children and women, people from developing countries where resources and education about taking iron and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; supplements are not available can also be under the risk of iron deficiency.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

===The male ideal===
To further support the argument, George claims that the research on plant-based nutrition was "done almost entirely on men" to support the statement that one does not need to eat animal products for good health.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In George's opinion, the potential health risks brought by a vegetarian or vegan diet are "rare for Western adult males, for whom the ideal is best suited".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Also, "the nutritional evidence suggests that the best candidates for vegetarianism, and for veganism in particular, are young, healthy adult males" because they do not have the nutritional stress "from feeding a rapidly growing fetus nor are they unduly stressed by their own growth requirements, as most of their growth is accomplished".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In general, good health can be achieved and maintained on a vegetarian or vegan diet by privileged people who are "adult [20–50-year-old] male, non-allergic, healthy, well-educated, middle or upper class individual or upper class female unable to bear children".&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Animal, Vegetable, or Woman?: A Feminist Critique of Ethical Vegetarianism|last=George|first=Kathryn Paxton|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Albany, New York, United States|pages=16–197|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone else who does not fall into the category of those privileged people is "''physiologically'' barred" from both maintaining health and "being fully moral" of not consuming animals.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

In ''A Defense of the Feminist-Vegetarian Connection,'' Lucas summarizes George's arguments on healthy vegetarian and vegan diets as diets that "[requires] access to fortified foods, supplements, a dietitian, and many other advantages".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Therefore, an "ecofeminist dilemma" arises in the form that "the entire human population cannot enjoy health on vegetarian diets unless an environmental dire spread of industrialization occurs".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; According to George, even if fortified foods and supplements are already incorporated into one's diet, the risk of supplementation still takes its toll on people's health due to "the possibility of toxicity, low availability, and interactions among supplements".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

===Vegetarianism and veganism not as feminist ideals===
According to George, there are two "minimum conceptions of a feminist ethics": "First, no ethics can permit arbitrariness in its prescriptions and theories," and, "Second, any specific feminist ethic must affirm the value of the female body".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Thus, for George, "any feminist ethic must reject (1) requiring women to live as if physiologically the same as men and (2) placing arbitrary burdens upon females that males do not have to bear".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; However, in order to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet, women are required "to accept these burdens rather than reject them".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Therefore, this requirement upon women causes vegetarianism and veganism to "hardly be a feminist ideal".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Instead, George thinks that semivegetarianism best embraces "the value of health" and that "it would be more productive ... to improve conditions for animals and to urge truly balanced diets that are not excessive".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

==Voices in support of the feminist–vegetarian connection==

===Food choices and gender identification===
Some scholars such as [[Carol J. Adams]] and [[Josephine Donovan]] support the feminist–vegetarian connection. In ''The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory'', Adams establishes "the cross-mapping between feminism and vegetarianism" through an in-depth analysis of gender identification embedded in people's food choices.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory|last=Adams|first=Carol J|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York, United States|pages=xxxiv–193|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a patriarchal society, "meat is constant for men, intermittent for women".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; For example, {{"'}}Ethiopian women and girls of all classes are obliged to prepare two meals, one for the males and a second, often containing no meat or other substantial protein, for the females{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Also, women who prepare to be pregnant are told that "one should eat meat (or fish, vegetables, chocolate, and salt) at least six weeks before becoming pregnant if one wants a boy. But if a girl is desired, no meat please, rather milk, cheese, nuts, beans, and cereals".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Additionally, there are cultural food taboos that concern meat consumption based on gender; women are commonly forbidden to have "chicken, duck, and pork" and also "fish, seafood, and eggs" in some Asian countries.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Only "vegetables and other nonmeat foods are viewed as women's food".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Thus, gender identification is heavily associated with the eating of animals; meat-eating links with masculinity while vegetable-eating suggests "emasculation or femininity".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; This gender-based reading of meat-eating is further accentuated by "[[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]'s notion of [[Phallogocentrism|carnophallogocentrism]]," indicating that "masculinity and carnivorism work together to support the virility, power, and authority of one who argues, dialogues, and speaks reasonably".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malatino|first=Hilary|year=2011|title=Carnophallogocentrism and the Sexual Politics of Meat|url=|journal=Journal of Critical Animal Studies|volume=9|pages=128–134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Links between women and animals===
Adams also argues that animals and women are linked through "fused oppressions" as "we oppress animals by associating them with women's lesser status".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Examples include the use of different gender pronouns based on whether an animal poses as having "''a major power'' (he) or ''a minor power'' (she)".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In this case, ''a major power'' refers to {{"'}}an active power and a possible danger to the speaker{{'"}} while ''a minor power'' refers to the power {{"'}}as a potential prey, a power that has to be destroyed{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Adams further explains that "'she' represents not only a 'minor power', but a vanished power, a soon-to-be-killed powerless animal".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Through Adams' analysis, a female-gendered pronoun becomes an indicator of the oppressed, "representing the violated victim of male violence".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Thus, women and animals are linked through "a shared and co-constitutive mechanism of oppression that manifests linguistically, particularly through metaphor".&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

In addition, Adams indicates that people exploits animals' "femaleness" through the consumption of female animals such as hens and cows as well as their by-products such as eggs and dairy.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In the [[meat industry]], slaughters are told not to slaughter female animals "in the advanced stage of pregnancy" because "the physiological condition of the female is disturbed and the flesh is not normal".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Conclusively, Adams states that "the text of the body upon whom we write the fate of being meat is symbolically if not predominantly female".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

Furthermore, Adams argues that the links between women and animals are reinforced "through a structure of the absent referent".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; For instance, animals whose flesh is called "meat" become "absent referent" through butchering;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; by renaming dead bodies as meat, people "do not conjured dead, butchered animals, but cuisine".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;  On the other hand, Women also becomes absent in the language about sexual violence.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; For example, the term "[[rape]]" is used metaphorically to depict other devastating violent incidents, such as {{"'}}rape' of the earth in ecological writing of the early 1970s{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In this case, the experiences of women are recalled "as a vehicle for explicating another being's oppression" yet women themselves are absent.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; According to Adams, violence against both women and animals in the form of "sexual violence and meat eating ... find a point of intersection in the absent referent; ... if animals are the absent referent in the phrase 'the butchering of women', women are the absent referent in the phrase 'the rape of animals{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

Vegetarian ecofeminism brings to light the interconnecting oppressions of women and animals within the patriarchal hierarchy. One primary issue that feminists address is autonomy over their bodies, independent and free from control from the church and the state. Vegan ecofeminist [[Marti Kheel]] contends that "the lack of control that women have over their reproductive capacity in patriarchal society is magnified on factory farms where female cows are kept in a continual state of lactation, and where rape racks are routinely used to impregnate female animals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheel|first=Marti|year=2005|title=Toppling Patriarchy with a Fork: the Feminist Debate Over Meat|url=|journal=Pacific Division of the Society for Women in Philosophy Conference|volume=|pages=1–22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alliance between feminism and vegetarianism===
After acknowledging the connections amongst vegetable-eating, women, and animals, Adams proposes that "not only was vegetarianism a logical enacting of a moral viewpoint, but it also resonated with feminist theory and female experience".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; According to ethicist Beverly Harrison, feminists must be with their bodies and acknowledge that all their knowledge, including their moral one, is 'body-mediated knowledge'; disconnecting from their bodies would result in the destruction of 'possibility of moral relations' amongst feminists.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;  Adams further asserts that "ethical vegetarianism is a theory people enact with their bodies" as "vegetarians identify a connection between a healthy body and a diet that honors the moral relations between us and other animals".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; From a biological point of view, Adams supports the arguments that humans have bodies of herbivores as opposed to those of carnivores due to the biological evidences from humans' "teeth, saliva, stomach acids, and length of the intestines".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Thus, vegetarianism and feminism are connected through the predominant involvement of one's body. Veganism is a method of rejection to partaking in the oppression of animals in a patriarchal culture.

===Other voices and evidences supporting the feminist–vegetarian connection===
Through evidences from several nutritional studies that prove the health benefits of vegetarian and vegan diets, Donovan explicitly proclaims that "yes, feminists should be vegetarians" one year after the publication of George's article "Should Feminists be Vegetarians?" in 1994.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donovan|first=Josephine|year=1994|title=Comment on George's "Should Feminists Be Vegetarians?"|url=|journal=Signs|volume=21|pages=226–229|doi=10.1086/495062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donovan quotes "Nutritional Consequences of Vegetarianism" that {{"'}}with appropriate attention to nutritional needs, the health consequences of vegetarianism itself are neutral and in some respects may even be positive{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Based on nutritional studies done in 1994, she also quotes that "infant, children, adolescents, and pregnant women have ... special needs ... vegan diets can safely be used by these groups if foods, and in some instances, supplements, are selected which provide a healthful and nutritionally adequate diet ... In many cases, vegan diets offer health benefits".&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Donovan also claims that "most non-Western diets are largely vegetarian" and meat-eating, as a 'Western norm', is imposed on non-Western countries through 'Western cultural imperialism'.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Moreover, according to Lucas, "in the West, nearly all of the available flesh, milk products, and eggs are the output of cruel, violet, and wasteful practices".&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; By extension, purchasing and consuming any animal products directly supports cruelty.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Such evidences disproving the potential biological and environmental harm caused by vegetarianism accentuates the necessity of adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet while being a feminist. According to Donovan, "feminism must take a stand against animal suffering and exploitation, including human consumption of meat".&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;

==Praxis==

===Activism===
While vegetarian ecofeminism is at its core an academic field, its main principles and ideas – eradicating all oppression by including speciesism and emphasizing the link between speciesism and sexism – can be transferred from theory into action through activism. Activism can take many forms, one of the most common and achievable being the power of boycotting products that support the exploitation and abuse of women and/or animals.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; For example, vegetarian ecofeminists might boycott products that were created in sweatshops and therefore exploited women, or products that were tested on animals or that were created by killing animals and therefore exploited nonhuman animals. The act of being a vegetarian or a vegan is itself a form of boycotting, for it choosing not to consume products that were created at the expense of killing or abusing nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Even at the Ecofeminist Task Force of the National Women's Studies Association suggested that no animal products should be served the 1990 NWSA meeting or at future conferences due to ecological and humane issues.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminist might put their beliefs into practice by participating in demonstrations, as was seen at the 1990 March for the Animals in Washington, D.C., when ecofeminists carried a banner showing their support of recognizing how the domination of humans over nonhumans animals fits into ecofeminism, but also feminism in general.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Key thinkers==
Since vegetarian ecofeminism is part of the larger academic field of ecofeminism, the most significant thinkers of vegetarian ecofeminism are part of both, but one of their focuses is connecting the domination of women to the domination of nonhuman animals, and understanding how animal liberation fits into ecofeminism.

[[Greta Gaard]] is one of the main thinkers within ecofeminism in general, but especially within vegetarian ecofeminism. Aside from being an activist and a writer, she is also a professor at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls. Her essay entitled "Vegetarian Ecofeminism" speaks to many of the key concepts within the field, including the importance of including speciesism in ecofeminism.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

[[Carol J. Adams]], both a vegetarian ecofeminist writer and activist, has spent over twenty years writing about ecofeminism, focusing on the importance of connecting speciesism to sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sister Species: Women, Animals, and Social Justice|last=Kemmerer|first=Lisa|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her article entitled "Ecofeminism and the Eating of Animals" is an essential work to the field, and draws upon the importance of not consuming meat as an ecofeminist. Another one of her major works is "The Sexual Politics of Meat", which once again examines major themes in vegetarian ecofeminism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12161">The '''Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights''' is a collaborative effort by governments, major multinational extractive companies, and NGOs to provide guidance to companies on tangible steps that they can take to minimize the risk of human rights abuses in communities located near extraction sites. The principles documents provide guidance to companies in developing practices that maintain the safety and security of their operations while respecting the [[human rights]] of those who come into contact with security forces related to those operations.  The Principles give guidance on risk assessment, public safety and security, human rights abuses, and the interaction between companies and private security. The initiative's Secretariat is administered by the Washington, D.C. office of [[Foley Hoag|Foley Hoag, LLP]].

The written principles represent a voluntary agreement between participating companies, governments and NGO's on what steps companies should take to ensure their security practices respect human rights.  To distinguish between the principles and the multi-stakeholder initiative, the principles are frequently abbreviated to the VPs and the tripartite organization is abbreviated to the VPI (Voluntary Principles Initiative).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |format=PDF|url=http://www.voluntaryprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Government-of-Australia-Public-Report-April-2015.pdf|title=Annual Report to the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights Initiative 2014|publisher=Government of Australia|date= 2014|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Principles==

The introduction to the text of the VPs includes the following statement that captures the various interests that the principles attempt to address:
“Acknowledging that security is a fundamental need, shared by individuals, communities, businesses, and governments alike, and acknowledging the difficult security issues faced by Companies operating globally, we recognize that security and respect for human rights can and should be consistent”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.voluntaryprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/voluntary_principles_english.pdf|title=The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|publisher=Foley Hoag LLP, the Secretariat for the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VPs include provisions defining expectations that:
*companies should regularly engage with host governments and local communities regarding security issues and practices;
*security forces should act in a manner consistent with UN Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, including that any [[Use of force continuum|use of force]] needs to be proportional to the related threat;
*companies should have mechanisms for the reporting and investigation of allegations of improper actions by private security forces hired by the company;
*companies should have mechanism to report alleged abuses by [[public security]] forces in their area of operation, and to encourage and monitor progress of investigations;

Through the inclusion of elements of the VPs in services contracts with security providers, the VPs have been cited as a precedent for the inclusion of codes of conduct in legal contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=1xH7AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=Voluntary+Principles+on+Security+and+Human+Rights&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Voluntary%20Principles%20on%20Security%20and%20Human%20Rights&amp;f=false|title=Normative Pluralism and International Law: Exploring Global Governance|author=Jan Klabbers, Touko Piiparinen|pages=196 | publisher=Cambridge University Press|date= Apr 22, 2013 |accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the VPs aren't designed to deal with root causes of conflicts, they do guide companies to have measures in place to prevent conflicts from escalating to violent confrontation. In an April 2015 article in The newsletter of the International Council on Mining and Metals, International Alert noted that while this potential seems to be recognized at senior levels in companies that have committed to the VPs, there is work still to be done to better implement the principles "on the ground".  This reflects both the challenges of translating the principles into practices appropriate in each operating context, and also challenges companies can have in engaging with, and reaching agreements with, public authorities in operating locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.icmm.com/document/8633|title=Voluntary Principles offer an alternative to conflict| journal = Good Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 11 |publisher=International Council on Mining and Metals|date=April 2015|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principles are significant in two ways:
* the articulation of the principles provides important guidance to industry and also common reference points for dialogue between industry, government and civil society on how to align security and human rights; and 
* the development of the Principles represented an important international collaboration between industry, government and civil society organizations

The Principles have also been cited as an example of moving the notion of corporate citizenship from principle into practice, though the commitment by participating companies to follow the approach articulated in the Principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=HcItu0lPNVsC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=Voluntary+Principles+on+Security+and+Human+Rights&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Voluntary%20Principles%20on%20Security%20and%20Human%20Rights&amp;f=false|title=United States Practice in International Law: Volume 1, 1999–2001|author=Sean D. Murphy|pages=270 | publisher=Cambridge University Press|date= Jan 9, 2003|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voluntary Principles Initiative (organization)==

The Voluntary Principles Initiative (VPI) was established in 2000, and although developed before the [[United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]], the VPs are consistent with the responsibility of business to respect human rights as outlined in the UN Guiding Principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/fs/2012/202314.htm|title=Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, Fact Sheet|publisher=U.S. Department of State - Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights &amp; Labor|date=20 December 2012|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Initiative is a multi-stakeholder initiative composed of governments, multinational oil, gas, and mining companies, and non-governmental organizations.  The initiative is chaired by a member government, rotating between country members annually. As of 2015 participants in the initiative include 9 national governments, 27 companies, and 10 non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.voluntaryprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VPs-Fact-Sheet-June-2015.pdf|title=The Voluntary Principles Fact Sheet|publisher=Foley Hoag LLP, the Secretariat for the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|date= June 2015|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2010 the law firm [[Foley Hoag|Foley Hoag LLP]] was selected to act as the Secretariat of the VPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.foleyhoag.com/news-and-events/news/2010/september/csr-practice-selected-as-secretariat-for-voluntary-principles-on-security-and-human-rights|title=CSR Practice Selected as Secretariat for Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|publisher=Foley Hoag LLP|date=30 September 2010|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VPI holds an annual two-day plenary meeting to discuss progress and issues in the implementation of the VPs and to agree on collective priorities for the Initiative in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.voluntaryprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Attachment-VPI-Minutes-Annual-Plenary-Final.pdf|title=Minutes Of The 2015 Annual Plenary Meeting Of The Voluntary Principles Initiative|publisher=Foley Hoag LLP,the Secretariat for the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|date=2015|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporting activities and guidance==

Supporting documentation produced by the VPI for the VPs includes definitions of role and responsibilities of participating companies, governments, and [[non-governmental organization]]s.

Member organizations have also collaborated to produce guidance documents to assist companies and civil society organizations in working with the VPs. 
* In 2008 International Alert, with financial support from the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] governments, developed a guide titled "Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights: Performance Indicators".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.international-alert.org/sites/default/files/publications/VoluntaryPrinciplesOnSecurityHumanRights.pdf|title=Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights: Performance Indicators|publisher=International Alert|date=June 2008|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012 a guide to the implementation of the VPs was launched by the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC), the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues (IPECA), and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Red Cros]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=F8MelWQAkS4C&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=Voluntary+Principles+on+Security+and+Human+Rights&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Voluntary%20Principles%20on%20Security%20and%20Human%20Rights&amp;f=false|title=Integrating Human Rights into Development, 2nd Edition Donor Approaches, Experiences and Challenges|author=OECD, The World Bank|pages=173 | publisher=OECD Publishing|date= May 27, 2013|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2015 the [[United Nations Global Compact|Global Compact]] Network Canada launched a "Guidance Document on the Assurance of the Voluntary Principles (VPs) on Security and Human Rights" to assist companies in assessing their degree of implementation of the VPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.globalcompact.ca/blog/official-blog/2015/05/27/launch-of-the-guidance-document-assurance-of-the-voluntary-principles-on-security-and-human-rights-may-26-2015-toronto-canada|title=Launch of the Guidance Document – Assurance of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|publisher=UN Global Compact Canada|date=May 27, 2015|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Member countries also make efforts to encourage companies operating internationally to adhere to the VPs.  The Canadian government includes the VPs in its framework "Doing Business the Canadian Way: A Strategy to Advance Corporate Social Responsibility in Canada’s Extractive Sector Abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/topics-domaines/other-autre/csr-strat-rse.aspx?lang=eng|title=Doing Business the Canadian Way: A Strategy to Advance Corporate Social Responsibility in Canada’s Extractive Sector Abroad|publisher=Government of Canada, Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss government describes its efforts as both raising awareness of the VPs among mining companies based in Switzerland, and also engaging with host governments in resource rich countries to persuade those governments to join the initiative and also to promote dialogue between host governments, companies and civil society - particularly in [[Peru]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/fdfa/foreign-policy/human-rights/human-rights-policy/business-human-rights/voluntary-principles.html|title=Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|publisher=Government of Switzerland|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
