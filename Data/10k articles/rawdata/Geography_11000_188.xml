A '''canton''' is a type of [[administrative division]] of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Canton (division)|display=Canton|volume=5|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The word is derived from the Latin ''[[canto]]'' "section of a country." --&gt; In general, cantons are relatively small in terms of area and population when compared with other administrative divisions such as [[county|counties]], [[Department (administrative division)|department]]s, or [[province]]s. Internationally, the best-known cantons - and the most politically important - are those of [[Switzerland]]. As the constituents of the Swiss Confederation, theoretically (and historically), the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss cantons]] are semi-sovereign states.

The term is derived from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[:fr:canton|canton]]'', meaning ''corner'' or ''district'' (from which "[[Cantonment]]" is also derived).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cantonment and canton, v.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emanuela Casti''' (born 1950 in Mira, Venice, Italy) is an Italian geographer and a cartography theorist. A Full Professor at the [[University of Bergamo]] (Italy), in 2004 Casti founded the [http://www.unibg.it/diathesis/ Diathesis Cartographic Lab], a permanent workshop devoted to territorial analysis, cartographic innovation and experimentation. A noted innovator in the field of theoretical cartography, Casti formalized a semiotic theory of geographic maps, which in its most recent development has also embraced cybercartography. Since 2013, she has coordinated the applied [http://www.rifoit.org/ RIFO/it] research on urban regeneration/land restitution, a project funded by Italcementi Group which gathers leading Italian architects and urban planners.
[[File:Emanuela Casti staff.JPG|thumb|Emanuela Casti and her staff of research, University of Bergamo, December 2014]]

== Biography ==
Having graduated at the [[University of Padua]] with a thesis on the historical evolution of cartography in Mantua, professor Casti started her academic research in 1983, when she was appointed researcher at the same university. Casti became an associate professor at the University of Bergamo in 1992 and full professor in 2001. She also taught courses, lectures and seminars at other academic institution both in Italy ([[University of Turin]]) and abroad ([[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL - École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]], Parigi VII - Paris- Diderot).
Since the date of its foundation until it was officially terminated  in 2012, professor Casti was a member of the Academic Board (Collegio dei Docenti) for the PhD program  on “Geografia dello sviluppo e delle dinamiche urbano-regionali” (Geography of development and of urban-regional dynamics). She has been involved in research groups both at the national level  (with active links to the Italian journal Terra d’Africa) and internationally (within the Eidolon network). Casti is also a member of many leading Italian societies ([[:it:Associazione dei geografi italiani|AGeI]], [[:it:Società geografica italiana|SGI]], RGI, AIIGI) and international workgroups (UGI, [http://icaci.org/ ICA]).
After starting her career as a specialist on Venetian historical cartography, Casti has widened the scope of her research to embrace various historical periods. She has extensively analyzed the role of maps in the Italian region of Lombardy in the Renaissance and Early Modern times; addressed key issues in Italian and French colonial cartography and investigated prehistoric examples of rock-engraved mapping in Valcamonica (Camonica Valley, Italy). Far from being regarded as mere historical artifacts, these cartographic examples provided a solid background for empirical and applied analysis. On the basis of such maps, professor Casti developed her theory of cartographic semiosis. Casti has also used the same theory to shed more light on the products and the communicative and pragmatic potential of digital mapping, GIS and WebGIS, with a focus on participatory mapping in support of local governance. By pinpointing the complex mechanisms at work in a geographic map, Casti’s research highlighted the links between cartography and geography and the discrepancies between traditional and digital maps.
Africa has long been the privileged object of professor Casti’s numerous on-site surveys, well over thirty since 1992. In this context,  she conducted applied research regarding environmental protection and cooperation with countries in the developing world, working within the framework of EU programs, of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]](IUCN)and of [[UNESCO]]. In particular, Casti participated in projects for the management of the buffer zones of protected areas in West Africa: i.e. the 2002-2005 collaborative project with the French CIRAD research center of Montpellier involving the [[W National Park|W Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Niger]], Benin and Burkina Faso; and the 2006-2009 collaboration with the excellence university center 2iE- Institut International d'Ingéniérie de l'Eau et de l'Environnement di Ouagadougou - Arly Protection and Conservation Unit in Burkina Faso.
Prof. Casti currently pursues her line of theoretical and applied research in the field of cartography, while also devoting herself to urban planning and territorial valorization and development. Through the creation of participatory mapping systems between 2012 and 2013, Casti led the participatory process for the application of the Italian city of Bergamo as 2019 European Capital of Culture (Bergamo Open Mapping) and, in the years 2014 to 2015, the participatory process for the revitalization of public spaces in Bergamo (BG Public Space).
In 2012, with the aim to kickstart the regeneration of territories via a tourism-based approach, Casti promoted and implemented a European network of cluster cities (comprising Bergamo, Beauvais, Cambridge, Charleroi, Girona, Lübeck, Santander); all medium-sized cities, located in urban areas, with a university and an airport served by low-cost airlines (Project entitled: Centrality of Territories, towards the regeneration of Bergamo in a European network).
In the years 2013-2014 professor Casti addressed the themes of urban regeneration and land restitution through the elaboration of the RIFO method, adopted for analyzing and mapping disused and obsolete areas in Lombardy.

== Main theoretical achievements ==

=== The Theory of Cartographic Semiosis ===
Professor Casti elaborated the theory of cartographic semiosis in 1998, when she also published her first theoretical book L’ordine del mondo e la sua rappresentazione, translated into English in 2005 under the title Reality as Representation. The semiotics of cartography and the generation of meaning. Casti’s theory lies within the fold of the research area called “postmodern cartography” inaugurated by [[:en:John Brian Harley|John B. Harley]] in 1989 and developed in the first decade of the 21st century  with contributions by Emanuela Casti, Jeremy Crampton, Martin Dodge, Rob Kitchin, [[:en:John Pickles|John Pickles]], [[:en:Denis Wood|Denis Wood]]. The underlying assumption of postmodern research is a questioning of the objectivity and neutrality of maps, and more specifically a questioning of the scientific nature of Euclidean metrics. Accordingly, maps are not seen as straightforward “mirrors of reality”, but rather as  instruments through which reality is shaped. Casti’s key contribution lies in having embraced this initial assumption as a springboard for articulating a theory able to investigate the construction and the communicative mechanisms of maps. By shifting the focus of interest from maps as tools for mediating territory to maps as operators which actively affect the range of activities one can implement on territories, Casti’s theory earmarked the areas in which action is needed in order to take control of the communicative outcomes of mapping.  Assuming a symbiosis between territory and mapping, Casti conclusively defines maps as complex denonational acts, on the basis of which individuals  appropriate territory intellectually and symbolically order the world.  Maps should be taken as instances of a “metasemiosis" - or “second-level semiosis”, for even though they are based on territorial semiosis they also deploy signs, names, symbols which convey messages and meanings quite independently of the intentions of those who first produced them. Maps, Casti insists, are endowed with self-reference, which produces its own messages and may well lead an interpreter to read the world through the framework of theory and to advance entirely conjectural propositions as if they were facts (in this regard, Casti speaks of iconization). Casti rereads the theoretical framework of [[:en:Charles W. Morris|Charles Morris]], whereby signs in communication become  sign vehicles activated  by an interpreter, to show a cartographic semiosis based on icons (a key feature of maps) and analyzed in light of three aspects: in the encoding of signs (semantics); in the syntax that connects icons and develops  their meanings in a reticular dimension; in the pragmatic sphere, when maps become the objects of interpretation as well as key models for socially relevant patterns of behavior. Within such theoretical framework, maps become sophisticated instruments capable of suggesting and envisioning strategies of production, use and mediatization of territory to their interpreters. According to Casti, this network provides not only the platform for an interpretation of cartographic documents, but also for actual experimenting with maps, now tailored to the changing needs of society; maps that are designed to envisage a topological space, as Casti’s second theoretical book makes clear (Cartografia critica, translated in English as: Reflexive Cartography, 2015). Professor Casti explores the transition from a topographic mapping, created by government agencies, to open cartography, collaboratively produced by the people (and linked to a new idea of Chorography). The latter has the potential to become a highly workable concept, to be used as an operator for assisting citizens in thinking and designing their own living space and in understanding the current world. Specifically, Casti argues that, by virtue of its highly interactive features, new digital mapping (specifically [[:en:Web mapping|WebGIS]]) opens up new scenarios, and poses cybercartography as a privileged discipline for recovering and promoting the social significance of territory in all its forms  (landscape and environment).

=== The SIGAP strategy and participatory mapping ===
The SIGAP strategy (Geographic Information Systems for Protected Areas /Participatory Action) is a research methodology that adopts cartographic semiosis and tests its actual range of application. It takes up concepts presented by international agencies - such as "sustainability", "conservation" participation” - and turns them into operational tools for territorial and environmental planning. Tested in various national and international contexts with regard to a variety of issues (migration, environmental protection, landscape planning, tourism systems, urban regeneration, etc.), the  SIGAP methodology deploys the typical range of geography-based competences in the field of applied research. As such it involves all stages of analysis: the adoption of a theory informing land methodology; interaction with local  inhabitants for the reading of data;  construction of interpretative models and their cartographic visualization. In each of these stages, cartography takes on different capacities depending on the goal to be pursued. The final product is an interactive multimedia system [[Geographic information system|GIS]] (for example: [http://www.multimap-parcw.org/ Multimap] and [http://www.orobiemap.it/ Orobiemap]), which becomes as an invaluable tool for field research, for the implementation of  intervention strategies, for the processing and circulation of data.
Participatory mapping systems play an essential role in this context, because they can recover the role of local communities and produce cartographic representations that take account of local interests. According to the technology involved and the level of participation entailed, these systems may include: i) participatory mapping, carried out by local communities at the request of an external party; ii) Community Integrated GIS - or CIGIS, built and operated by actors outside the community but including data collected through participatory methodologies; iii) Public Participation GIS - PPGIS), made and used directly by local communities in an exchange with local administrators or supervising agencies. The latter, based on WebGIS technology, fall within the realm of "cybercartography" or “open” digital mapping systems that allow users to interact, by promoting social projects and processes (Geomatics and Cartographic Research Centre).

=== S-Low Tourism ===
Casti uses the phrase “s-Low Tourism”  to underline the absence of a clear conceptual break between the notion of slowness and the notion of speed. In fact, her acronym refers both to "slow" as a prerequisite for a mindful experience of territory, and to low-cost airlines that have revolutionized the way we think about air travel, as something different from a journey, something based on speed and safety. On the one hand, air travel has increased, is more intense, and usually covers a shorter period of time: it underlies a current lifestyle, whereby tourist destinations are no longer analyzed on the basis of conventional indicators. At the same time, though, the notion of sustainability applied to territorial planning has amply shown that tourism is a driving force for local communities, which conceive and present their own space not only as a holiday destination but as a place to be experienced in its social, cultural and environmental features.  In a leap of perspective, tourism ceases to be a mere driving force for economic development and becomes an opportunity for regional regeneration, with a view to producing social development through the recovery of a sense of place, that is to say of the key value of territory. This is a kind of regeneration that focuses on the cultural and natural resources of territories, now made available online to a new type of tourist who is steeped in information technology and accustomed to new modes of travel. This new tourist-traveller looks for a travel experience based on slow appreciation, on ecology-conscious, environmental and green mobility. Yet, at the same time, mobility has to be fast for travellers to be able to  experience more theme-based destinations that share comparable cultural features. At the local level, this new tourism is based on the enhancement of small enterprise projects, of smart technology, and of citizen participation.  Internationally, it must be based on a synergy between public and private institutions, aimed at promoting common policies to develop tourism and accessibility.

=== The RIFO method ===
The method comes from a monitoring study on disused and obsolete areas (buildings erected between 1950 and 1980) in Lombardy. It relies on three assumptions: the symbiosis between land-regeneration and urban restructuring; a shift of focus involving “cities” no longer seen as territorial structures but as sites that embody an ecological lifestyle; the prospect of circular restructuring of disused and discontinued areas, with the active participation of local inhabitants.
Operationally, this method aims at replacing outdated buildings (in terms of safety, energy saving, new forms of living, and sanitation) with new buildings that meet current living needs and at the same time reclaim wasted space. In fact, while maintaining the same volume for buildings, the RIFO method also expands the use of underground space and thus envisions a reduction of the surface taken up by covered areas, with the possibility of freeing up land for later use as parks and green areas. RIFO envisages a circular process of demolition and reconstruction for obsolete and disused areas, and so entails the relocation of inhabitants who live in old tenement buildings within the same district. Such short-range relocation aims at inclusive restructuring by implementing participatory strategies in the stages of planning, ensuring an active role for local inhabitants the whole process of demolition and construction. A participatory methodology - the SIGAP Strategy - retrieves the spatial capital, that is to say the set of knowledge and skills of inhabitants who actively operate the places they inhabit. SIGAP also sheds light on the use of space assets found in public RIFO areas (public services, accessibility, natural heritage); it detects priorities and critical issues (pollution factors, need for green spaces, social distress and safety) and recovers the layered values attributed to the sites.

'''Environmental health''' is the branch of [[public health]] concerned with all aspects of the [[natural environment|natural]] and [[built environment]] affecting human health. Other terms referring to or concerning environmental health are '''environmental public health''', and '''public health protection/''' '''environmental health protection'''. Environmental health is focused on the natural and built environments for the benefit of human health, whereas [[environmental protection]] is concerned with protecting the natural environment for the benefit of human health and the ecosystem.

==Definitions==
Environmental health has been defined in a 1999 document by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as:
:Those aspects of the [[human health]] and disease that are determined by factors in the environment. It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing and controlling factors in the environment that can potentially affect health.

:Environmental health as used by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, includes both the direct pathological effects of chemicals, radiation and some biological agents, and the effects (often indirect) on health and well being of the broad physical, psychological, social and cultural environment, which includes housing, urban development, land use and transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Novice| first = Robert (editor) | title = Overview of the environment and health in Europe in the 1990s| work = | publisher = World Health Organization| date =  1999-03-29| url = http://www.euro.who.int/document/e66792.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016 the WHO website on environmental health states "Environmental health addresses all the physical, chemical, and biological factors external to a person, and all the related factors impacting behaviours. It encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health. It is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health-supportive environments. This definition excludes behaviour not related to environment, as well as behaviour related to the social and cultural environment, as well as genetics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Health topics: Environmental health| url = http://www.who.int/topics/environmental_health/en/|author=WHO|date=n.d.|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO has also defined environmental health services as "those services which implement environmental health policies through monitoring and control activities. They also carry out that role by promoting the improvement of environmental parameters and by encouraging the use of environmentally friendly and healthy technologies and behaviors. They also have a leading role in developing and suggesting new policy areas."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The term [[environmental medicine]] may be seen as a medical specialty, or branch of the broader field of environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Terminology is not fully established, and in many European countries they are used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Environmental health profession==
Environmental health professionals may be known as [[environmental health officer]]s, public health inspectors, environmental health specialists, environmental health practitioners, or sanitarians. Researchers and policy-makers also play important roles in how environmental health is practiced in the field. In many European countries, physicians and veterinarians are involved in environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In the [[United Kingdom]], practitioners must have a graduate degree in environmental health and be certified and registered with the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health or the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/environmentalhealthofficer.aspx |title=Job Profiles: Environmental health officer| publisher=National Careers Service (UK) |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, practitioners in environmental health are required to obtain an approved bachelor's degree in environmental health along with the national professional certificate, the Certificate in Public Health Inspection (Canada) [[CPHI(C)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciphi.ca |title=Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors | accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many states in the [[United States]] also require that individuals have a bachelor's degree and professional [[license]]s in order to practice environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[California]] state law defines the scope of practice of environmental health as follows:&lt;ref&gt;California Health and Safety Code, section 106615(e)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Scope of practice in environmental health" means the practice of environmental health by registered environmental health specialists in the public and private sector within the meaning of this article and includes, but is not limited to, organization, management, education, enforcement, consultation, and emergency response for the purpose of prevention of environmental health hazards and the promotion and protection of the public health and the environment in the following areas: food protection; housing; institutional environmental health; land use; community noise control; recreational swimming areas and waters; electromagnetic radiation control; solid, liquid, and hazardous materials management; underground storage tank control; onsite septic systems; vector control; drinking water quality; water sanitation; emergency preparedness; and milk and dairy sanitation pursuant to Section 33113 of the Food and Agricultural Code.

The environmental health [[profession]] had its modern-day roots in the sanitary and public health movement of the United Kingdom. This was epitomized by [[Edwin Chadwick|Sir Edwin Chadwick]], who was instrumental in the repeal of the [[poor law]]s, and in 1884 was the founding president of the Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors, now called the [[Chartered Institute of Environmental Health]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Disciplines ==

Five basic disciplines generally contribute to the field of environmental health: environmental epidemiology, toxicology, exposure science, environmental engineering, and environmental law. Each of these disciplines contributes different information to describe problems and solutions in environmental health, but there is some overlap among them.
:*[[Environmental epidemiology]] studies the relationship between environmental exposures (including exposure to chemicals, radiation, microbiological agents, etc.) and human health. Observational studies, which simply observe exposures that people have already experienced, are common in environmental epidemiology because humans cannot ethically be exposed to agents that are known or suspected to cause disease. While the inability to use experimental study designs is a limitation of environmental epidemiology, this discipline directly observes effects on human health rather than estimating effects from animal studies.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
:*[[Toxicology]] studies how environmental exposures lead to specific health outcomes, generally in animals, as a means to understand possible health outcomes in humans. Toxicology has the advantage of being able to conduct randomized controlled trials and other experimental studies because they can use animal subjects. However there are many differences in animal and human biology, and there can be a lot of uncertainty when interpreting the results of [[animal studies]] for their implications for human health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
:*[[Exposure science]] studies human exposure to environmental contaminants by both identifying and quantifying exposures. Exposure science can be used to support environmental epidemiology by better describing environmental exposures that may lead to a particular health outcome,identify common exposures whose health outcomes may be better understood through a toxicology study, or can be used in a risk assessment to determine whether current levels of exposure might exceed recommended levels. Exposure science has the advantage of being able to very accurately quantify exposures to specific chemicals, but it does not generate any information about health outcomes like environmental epidemiology or toxicology.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
:*[[Environmental engineering]] applies scientific and engineering principles for protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors; protection of environments from potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities; and general improvement of environmental quality.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
:*[[Environmental law]] includes the network of treaties, statutes, regulations, common and customary laws addressing the effects of human activity on the natural environment.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Information from epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure science can be combined to conduct a [[risk assessment]] for specific chemicals, mixtures of chemicals or other risk factors to determine whether an exposure poses significant risk to human health (exposure would likely result in the development of [[List_of_pollution-related_diseases|pollution-related diseases]]). This can in turn be used to develop and implement environmental health policy that, for example, regulates chemical emissions, or imposes standards for proper [[sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTgSBW8jE8QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=environmental%20health%20from%20global%20to%20local%20by%20howard%20frumkin&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=environmental%20health%20from%20global%20to%20local%20by%20howard%20frumkin&amp;f=false|title= Environmental Health: from Global to Local|edition=2 Editor= Howard Frumkin|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|location= San Francisco|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Actions of engineering and law can be combined to provide [[risk management]] to minimize, monitor, and otherwise manage the impact of exposure to protect human health to achieve the objectives of environmental health policy.

==Concerns==
{{prose|date=January 2015}}
Environmental health addresses all human-health-related aspects of the natural environment and the built environment. Environmental health concerns include:

* [[Air quality]], including both ambient outdoor air and [[indoor air quality]], which also comprises concerns about [[environmental tobacco smoke]].
* [[Biosafety]]
* [[Effects of climate change on human health|Climate change and its effects on health]].
* [[Disaster preparedness]] and response.
* [[Food safety]], including in [[agriculture]], [[transportation]], [[food processing]], [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] distribution and sale.
* [[Hazardous materials]] management, including [[hazardous waste]] management, contaminated site remediation, the prevention of leaks from [[underground storage tank]]s and the prevention of hazardous materials releases to the environment and responses to emergency situations resulting from such releases.
* [[House|Housing]], including [[substandard housing]] abatement and the inspection of [[jails]] and [[prisons]].
* Childhood [[lead poisoning]] prevention.
* [[Land use planning]], including [[smart growth]].
* Liquid waste disposal, including city [[waste water treatment]] plants and on-site waste water disposal systems, such as [[septic tank]] systems and [[chemical toilet]]s.
* [[Medical waste]] management and disposal.
* [[Noise pollution]] control.
* [[Occupational health]] and [[industrial hygiene]].
* Radiological health, including exposure to [[ionizing radiation]] from [[X-rays]] or [[radioactive isotopes]].
* Recreational water illness prevention, including from [[swimming pools]], spas and [[ocean]] and [[freshwater]] bathing places.
* Safe [[drinking water]].
* [[Solid waste management]], including [[landfill]]s, [[recycling]] facilities, [[composting]] and solid waste transfer stations.
* [[Toxic]] chemical exposure whether in [[consumer products]], housing, workplaces, air, water or soil.
* [[Vector control]], including the control of [[mosquitoes]], [[rodents]], [[flies]], [[cockroach]]es and other animals that may transmit [[pathogens]].

According to recent estimates, about 5 to 10% of [[Disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALYs) lost are due to environmental causes in Europe. By far the most important factor is fine [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] pollution in urban air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/countries/nl/national-and-regional-story-netherlands-1 National and regional story (Netherlands) - Environmental burden of disease in Europe: the Abode project]. EEA.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, environmental exposures have been estimated to contribute to 4.9 million (8.7%) deaths and 86 million (5.7%) [[DALYs]] globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehjournal.net/content/10/1/9 Knows and unknowns on burden of disease due to chemicals: a systematic review]. Press-Ustinov, A., et al. 2011. Environmental Health 10:9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, Superfund sites created by various companies have been found to be hazardous to human and environmental health in nearby communities. It was this perceived threat, raising the specter of miscarriages, mutations, birth defects, and cancers that most frightened the public.&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher, D. (1995). Superfund’s Abandoned Hazardous Waste Sites. In A. Wildavsky (Ed.), But Is it True?: A Citizen’s Guide to Environmental Health and Safety Issues (153-184) . Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

The Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro.html |title=TEHIP|publisher= United States National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site, that includes open access to resources produced by US government agencies and organizations, and is maintained under the umbrella of the Specialized Information Service at the [[United States National Library of Medicine]]. TEHIP includes links to technical databases, bibliographies, tutorials, and consumer-oriented resources. 
TEHIP is responsible for the [[Toxicology Data Network]] (TOXNET),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/|title=TOXNET|publisher= United States National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases including the [[Hazardous Substances Data Bank]], that are open access, i.e. available free of charge.

==Mapping==

There are many environmental health mapping tools. [[TOXMAP]] is a geographic information system (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services&lt;ref&gt;[http://sis.nlm.nih.gov sis.nlm.nih.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US federal government. TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from the NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET)&lt;ref&gt;[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov toxnet.nlm.nih.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PubMed]], and from other authoritative sources.

{{Politics of Portugal}}

'''''Freguesia''''' ({{IPA-pt|ˌfɾɛɣɨˈzi.ɐ}}), usually translated as "[[Parish (administrative division)|parish]]" or "civil parish", is the third-level [[Administrative divisions of Portugal|administrative subdivision]] of [[Portugal]], as defined by the [[Constitution of Portugal|1976 Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Cons05"&gt;{{cite web|title=7th Constitutional Revision |url=http://app.parlamento.pt/site_antigo/ingles/cons_leg/Constitution_VII_revisao_definitive.pdf |accessdate=13 August 2014 |publisher=[[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)]] |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022091934/http://app.parlamento.pt/site_antigo/ingles/cons_leg/Constitution_VII_revisao_definitive.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a [[local administrative unit]] in the former Portuguese overseas territories of [[Administrative divisions of Cape Verde|Cape Verde]] and [[Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau|Macau]]. In the past, was also an administrative division of the other Portuguese overseas territories. The ''[[Parroquia (Spain)|parroquia]]'' in the Spanish autonomous communities of Galicia and Asturias is similar to a ''freguesia''.

A ''freguesia'' is a subdivision of a ''[[Municipalities of Portugal|município]]'' (municipality). Most often, a parish takes the name of its seat, which is usually the most important (or the single) human agglomeration within its area, which can be a neighbourhood or city district, a group of hamlets, a village, a town or an entire city. In cases where the seat is itself divided into more than one parish, each one takes the name of a landmark within its area or of the patron saint from the usually coterminous [[Catholic]] parish (''paróquia'' in Portuguese). Be it a city district or village, the civil parish is often based on an ecclesiastical parish.

Since the creation of a democratic local administration, in 1976, the Portuguese parishes have been ruled by a system composed by an executive body (the ''[[junta de freguesia]]'', "parish board") and a deliberative body (the ''[[assembleia de freguesia]]'', "parish assembly"). The members of the ''assembleia de freguesia'' are publicly elected every four years. The presidents of the parish boards are also members of the [[Assembleia Municipal|municipal assembly]].&lt;ref name="Cons05"/&gt;

==History==

The parish, in contrast with the municipalities, had their base in the ecclesiastical divisions that ''"had its origin in the fact that neighbours professed the same religion and professed their faith and divinity in the same temple"''.&lt;ref name=ferreira&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://hdl.handle.net/10216/19439|first=José António Costa|last=Ferreira|year=2005|title=O Poder Local e Regional na Assembleia Constituinte de 1975/76: As Regiões Adminsitrativas|publisher=Faculdade de Letras, Universidade do Porto|location=Porto, Portugal|language=Portuguese|pages=20–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Freguesia'', the traditional Portuguese word for parish, had its beginning in the ''filius ecclesiae'' (child of the church) and ''filius gregis'' (child of the shepherds's flock), the collectivity of the religious faithful, with similar aspirations and interests.&lt;ref name=ferreira/&gt; Between 1216 and 1223, [[Afonso II of Portugal]] began a process of legitimizing the Portuguese territory by conferring charters to nobles, clergy and municipal chambers (which would not be completed until after 1249, under [[Afonso III of Portugal]]), making the parish the smallest division. But, the power of the clergy built these areas, accumulating immense wealth and power. The liberal government of [[Mouzinho da Silveira]] abolished the parishes in 1832, but the government of [[Manuel da Silva Passos]] restored them in 1836.&lt;ref name=ferreira/&gt; The ''freguesia'' began to refer to the civil/administrative entity, while the ''paróquia'' ({{lang-lat|parochia}}) became affiliated with the religious entity.

Before the 2013 local government reforms, the 308 municipalities were subdivided into 4,259 civil parishes.&lt;ref name=greendoc&gt;{{Cite web|title=Documento Verde da Reforma da Administração Local|editor=Gabinete do Ministro Adjunto e dos Assuntos Parlamentares |publisher=Governo da República |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |year=2011 |accessdate=13 August 2014 |url=http://www.portugal.gov.pt/media/132774/doc_verde_ref_adm_local.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igeo.pt/produtos/cadastro/caop/download/Dados_CAOP2011.pdf Data of the Official Administrative Charter of Portugal, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, after more than two weeks of bailout negotiations in light of the [[sovereign debt crisis]] with the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[European Commission]], the Portuguese government was obliged to reduce the number of municipal and parish local governments after July 2012.&lt;ref name="RTP110504"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv1.rtp.pt/noticias/index.php?t=Governo-e-troika-acordam-reduzir-numero-de-camaras-e-freguesias.rtp&amp;article=438751&amp;layout=10&amp;visual=3&amp;tm=6|title=Governo e `troika` acordam reduzir número de câmaras e freguesias|accessdate=4 May 2011|date=4 May 2011|language=Portuguese|publisher=RTP Online|location=Lisbon, Portugal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] introduced a plan to reform the administrative divisions, in order to create efficiencies and save money. The plan envisioned the reform of the management, territorial geography and political form of how Portugal functioned at the local level, including specifically at the ''freguesia'' and ''[[concelho]]'' levels.&lt;ref name=greendoc/&gt; It was determined that these changes would then be formalized before the 2013 local government elections, as part of a process to reduce expenditures, a condition of the $110 Billion accord.&lt;ref name=RTP110504/&gt; In addition to the reduction of the number of representatives in the local boards, the plan also established criteria for the reduction, amalgamation or extinction of various civil parishes.&lt;ref name=greendoc/&gt;

The reform was implemented according to Law 11-A/2013 of 28 January 2013, which defined the reorganization of the civil parishes,&lt;ref name=law11A&gt;{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=13 August 2014|work=[[Diário da República]]|publisher=[[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)]]|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way, the number of parishes was reduced from 4,259 to 3,091.

Municipalities in Portugal are usually divided into multiple ''freguesias'', but seven municipalities are not: [[Alpiarça]], [[Barrancos]], [[Castanheira de Pera]], [[Porto Santo Island|Porto Santo]], [[São Brás de Alportel]] and [[São João da Madeira]] all consist of a single civil parish, and [[Vila do Corvo (Azores)|Corvo]] is a special case of a municipality without civil parishes. [[Barcelos Municipality, Portugal|Barcelos]] is the municipality with the most civil parishes (61, since 2013).

'''Friedrich Ratzel''' (August 30, 1844 – August 9, 1904) was a [[Germany|German]] [[geographer]] and [[ethnographer]], notable for first using the term ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space") in the sense that the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] later would.

==Life==
Ratzel's father was the head of the household staff of the Grand Duke of Baden. Friedrich attended high school in Karlsruhe for six years before being apprenticed at age 15 to [[apothecary|apothecaries]]. In 1863, he went to [[Rapperswil]] on the [[Lake of Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], where he began to study the [[classics]]. After a further year as an apothecary at [[Moers]] near [[Krefeld]] in the [[Ruhr]] area (1865–1866), he spent a short time at the high school in Karlsruhe and became a student of [[zoology]] at the universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Jena|Jena]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], finishing in 1868.  He studied zoology in 1869, publishing ''Sein und Werden der organischen Welt'' on [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].

After the completion of his schooling, Ratzel began a period of travels that saw him transform from zoologist/biologist to geographer. He began field work in the [[Mediterranean]], writing letters of his experiences. These letters led to a job as a traveling reporter for the ''[[Kölnische Zeitung]]'' ("Cologne Journal"), which provided him the means for further travel. Ratzel embarked on several expeditions, the lengthiest and most important being his 1874-1875 trip to [[North America]], [[Cuba]], and [[Mexico]].  This trip was a turning point in Ratzel’s career. He studied the influence of people of German origin in [[United States|America]], especially in the [[Midwest]], as well as other ethnic groups in North America.

He produced a written work of his account in 1876, ''Städte-und Kulturbilder aus Nordamerika'' (Profile of Cities and Cultures in North America), which would help establish the field of [[cultural geography]].  According to Ratzel, cities are the best place to study people because life is "blended, compressed, and accelerated" in cities, and they bring out the "greatest, best, most typical aspects of people". Ratzel had traveled to cities such as [[New York City|New York]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[New Orleans]], and [[San Francisco]].

Upon his return in 1875, Ratzel became a lecturer in geography at the Technical High School in [[Munich]]. In 1876, he was promoted to assistant professor, then rose to full professor in 1880. While at Munich, Ratzel produced several books and established his career as an academic. In 1886, he accepted an appointment at [[Leipzig University]]. His lectures were widely attended, notably by the influential American geographer [[Ellen Churchill Semple]].

Ratzel produced the foundations of [[human geography]] in his two-volume ''Anthropogeographie'' in 1882 and 1891.  This work was misinterpreted by many of his students, creating a number of [[environmental determinism|environmental determinists]].  He published his work on [[political geography]], ''Politische Geographie'', in 1897. It was in this work that Ratzel introduced concepts that contributed to [[Lebensraum]] and [[Social Darwinism]]. His three volume work ''The History of Mankind''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/history_introduction.htm The History of Mankind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013133706/http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/history_introduction.htm |date=2009-10-13 }} by Professor Friedrich Ratzel, MacMillan and Co., Ltd., published 1896&lt;/ref&gt; was published in English in 1896 and contained over 1100 excellent engravings and remarkable [[chromolithography]].

Ratzel continued his work at Leipzig until his sudden death on August 9, 1904 in [[Ammerland]], Germany.
Ratzel, a scholar of versatile academic interest, was a staunch German. During the outbreak of Franco-Prussian war in 1870, he joined the Prussian army and was wounded twice during the war.

==Writings==
Influenced by thinkers including Darwin and [[zoologist]] [[Ernst Heinrich Haeckel]], he published several papers. Among them is the essay ''Lebensraum'' (1901) concerning [[biogeography]], creating a foundation for the uniquely German variant of [[geopolitics]]: ''[[Geopolitik]]''.

Ratzel’s writings coincided with the growth of [[Second Industrial Revolution|German industrialism]] after the [[Franco-Prussian war]] and the subsequent search for [[Market (economics)|market]]s that brought it into competition with [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. His writings served as welcome justification for [[imperialism|imperial expansion]].   Influenced by the [[United States|American]] [[geostrategy|geostrategist]] [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval reach, agreeing that [[sea power]] was self-sustaining, as the profit from [[international trade|trade]] would pay for the [[merchant marine]], unlike [[land power]].

Ratzel’s key contribution to ''geopolitik'' was the expansion on the biological conception of [[geography]], without a static conception of [[Border#Jurisdictional borders|border]]s. States are instead organic and growing, with borders representing only a temporary stop in their movement.  It is not the state proper that is the organism but the land in its [[spirituality|spiritual]] bond with the people, who draw sustenance from it. The expanse of a state’s borders is a reflection of the health of the nation.

Ratzel’s idea of ''Raum'' (space) would grow out of his organic state conception. His early concept of ''lebensraum'' was not political or economic but spiritual and racial [[nationalism|nationalist]] expansion.  The ''Raum-motiv'' is a historically-driving force, pushing peoples with great ''Kultur'' to naturally expand.  Space, for Ratzel, was a vague concept, theoretically unbounded.  ''Raum'' was defined as where [[German people|German]] peoples live, and other weaker states could serve to support German peoples economically, and [[German culture]] could fertilize other cultures. However, it ought to be noted that Ratzel's concept of ''raum'' was not overtly aggressive, but he theorized simply as the natural expansion of strong states into areas controlled by weaker states.

The book for which Ratzel is acknowledged all over the world is ''Anthropogeographie''. It was completed between 1872 and 1899. The main focus of this monumental work is on the effects of different physical features and locations on the style and life of the people.

Falah is a founder of the Toronto-based peer review international journal'' The Arab World Geographer'' and serves as its Editor-in-Chief. The ''AWG'' has become the major journal published in English for research on the geography of the Arab, Muslim, and Middle-Eastern worlds.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Biography==

===Early years===
Ghazi-Walid Falah was born in the village of Falahat Al Batouf, [[Galilee]], [[Israel]]. He earned his B.A and M.A from the [[Hebrew University]] of Jerusalem and PhD in Geography from [[Durham University]], U.K. After completing his doctorate in 1982, Dr. Falah taught geography for a short period at [[Tel Aviv University]], [[An-Najah University]] and in [[Hebron]].

In 1987, he established the [[Galilee]] Center for Social Research in [[Nazareth]], a research institute focused on Arab communities living in Israel, and he served as its first Executive Director until relocating to North America in 1991. There he was appointed as [[Fulbright]] Scholar and Visiting Associate Professor of Geography at the University of Northern Iowa.

===Canada===
In 1993, Falah migrated to Canada and subsequently became a Canadian citizen. He started a new chapter in his academic career in Toronto, with a grant from the [[MacArthur Foundation]], and was based at the [[University of Toronto]] as Visiting Associate Professor in the Department of Geography and Planning. During that same period, he was also a visiting scholar for five months at the University of Paris, [[Sorbonne]], supported by a French CNRS research grant. His research has included studies of the differential distribution of facilities in Israeli Jewish and Arab areas.

He joined the University of Toronto Centre for Urban and Community Studies in 1995 as Research Associate, remaining there until 2001. While working on his research in Toronto, Falah also served, 1995-1997, as Lecturer at the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]], a center for studies on the Muslim world. He then returned to the U.S., and accepted a position in the Department of Geography and Planning at the University of Akron in Ohio.

===Detention and release===
He was held for over three weeks in an Israeli jail after he was arrested on suspicion of espionage on July 8, 2006, while touring near the Lebanon border. The arrest occurred one week before the [[2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict]]. He was denied access to a lawyer for the first 18 days of his detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-07-27T165257Z_01_N27161586_RTRIDST_0_NEWS-MIDEAST-CANADA-ISRAEL-COL.XML&amp;archived=False| title=Canadian arrested in Israel not a spy, says son| date=July 27, 2006| publisher=Reuters Canada| accessdate=2006-07-27}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="accused"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/744297.html |title=Geographer Accused of Espionage for Hizbullah Released |date=July 30, 2006 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605054321/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/744297.html |archivedate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 2006, the Israeli [[Shin Bet]] security service and the Israeli police released Dr. Falah without filing charges against him.&lt;ref name="accused"/&gt;&lt;ref name="between"&gt;{{Cite news | last =Gravois | first =John | title =An Arrest on the Border | work =The Chronicle of Higher Education | date =2007-11-23 | url =http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i13/13a00101.htm|subscription=yes}} (Free version available at [http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/4474 [[Campus Watch]]])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent activities===
In recent years, Ghazi Falah has broadened his interests to include the geography of the media, focusing on the representation of Arabs and Muslims in daily newspapers in the U.S. His professional visits to Arab and Muslim countries include Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon, Syria, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Iran.

At present, Ghazi Falah is a tenured Full Professor at the [[University of Akron]] and engaged in research on American bilateral relations with the Arab world. This new project is based on an extensive student opinion survey conducted at university campuses in [[Lebanon]] and [[Kuwait]]. Geographers Colin Flint and Patrick McGreevey are co-researchers in this project.

==History==
Preliminary drafts for the establishment of the GDA were first laid out in 2011.&lt;ref name="uia"/&gt; In September 2011, Qatari diplomat [[Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser]] first publicly brought up the idea of forming a group for dryland countries at a [[United Nations]] (U.N.) meeting as a way to help improve food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2011/ga11143.doc.htm|title=Dryland Management Must Be Placed Higher on International Agenda, Stresses Secretary-General at High-level General Assembly Event on Desertification|publisher=United Nations|date=20 September 2011|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatari capital [[Doha]] played host to a meeting of sixteen prospective member countries and various potential partner groups in September 2012.&lt;ref name="gdaaboutus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaldrylandalliance.org/en/about-us/|title=About us|publisher=Global Dryland Alliance|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Qatari Emir [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani]] pledged a full committal to the formation of the GDA at the [[Sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly|68th U.N. General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/19/04/2018/Doha-chosen-as-Global-Dryland-Alliance-headquarters|title=Doha chosen as Global Dryland Alliance headquarters|website=thepeninsulaqatar.com|agency=Qatar News Agency|date=19 April 2018|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Ministerial Conference on Food Security in Drylands held in May 2015 in [[Marakesh]], [[Morocco]], a draft establishment treaty of the GDA was presented to the delegations in attendance.&lt;ref name="gdaaboutus"/&gt; The inaugural GDA conference took place on 15 October 2017 in Doha, during which the foundation treaty was signed by representatives of 13 countries. During the conference, it was announced that Qatar would fund the organization for the following two years and that its base of operations would be in Doha.&lt;ref name="marocaine"/&gt;

==Mission==
According to the GDA, one-third of the world's population live in [[drylands]], which make up roughly 40% of the Earth's land surface. Drylands face many agricultural and water challenges due to several factors such as droughts, temperature extremes, soil erosion and shallow soil depth.&lt;ref name="gdaaboutus"/&gt; Hence, the GDA has outlined several ways to help improve the food security of nations with large swathes of drylands, such as forming partnerships with private and public sector organizations, sharing and developing technologies that will help boost food security, financing food security projects in member countries, and addressing food security policies of dryland countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/15/10/2017/Foundation-treaty-to-be-signed-at-Global-Dryland-Alliance-meet|title=Foundation treaty to be signed at Global Dryland Alliance meet|publisher=The Peninsula|date=15 October 2017|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gnomonic with Tissot's Indicatrices of Distortion.svg|300px|thumb|The gnomonic projection with [[Tissot's indicatrix]] of deformation]]

A '''gnomonic map projection''' displays all [[great circle]]s as straight lines, resulting in any straight line segment on a gnomonic map showing a [[geodesic]], the shortest route between the segment's two endpoints. This is achieved by casting surface points of the sphere onto a [[tangent]] plane, each landing where a ray from the center of the sphere passes through the point on the surface and then on to the plane. No distortion occurs at the tangent point, but distortion increases rapidly away from it. Less than half of the [[sphere]] can be projected onto a finite map. Consequently, a [[Rectilinear lens|rectilinear photographic lens]], which is based on the gnomonic principle, cannot image more than 180 degrees.

==History==
The gnomonic [[Map projection|projection]] is said to be the oldest map projection, developed by [[Thales]] in the 6th century BC.
The path of the shadow-tip or light-spot in a [[sundial#Nodus-based sundials|nodus-based sundial]] traces out the same [[hyperbola]]e formed by parallels on a gnomonic map.

==Properties==
Since [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] and the [[equator]] are great circles, they are always shown as straight lines on a gnomonic map.

*If the tangent point is one of the [[Geographical pole|poles]] then the meridians are radial and equally spaced. The equator is at [[infinity]] in all directions. Other [[Circle of latitude|parallels]] are depicted as concentric [[circle]]s.
*If the tangent point is not on a pole or the equator, then the meridians are radially outward straight lines from a Pole, but not equally spaced. The equator is a straight line that is perpendicular to only one meridian, indicating that the projection is not [[conformal map|conformal]]. Other parallels are depicted as [[conic section]]s.
*If the tangent point is on the equator then the meridians are parallel but not equally spaced. The equator is a straight line perpendicular to the meridians. Other parallels are depicted as [[hyperbola]]e.
{{clear}}
[[Image:Gnomonic.png|thumb|right|300px|Great circles transform to straight lines via gnomonic projection]]

As with all [[azimuth]]al projections, angles from the tangent point are preserved. The map distance from that point is a function ''r''(''d'') of the true distance ''d'', given by

:&lt;math&gt; r(d) = R\,\tan \frac d R&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the radius of the Earth. The radial scale is

:&lt;math&gt; r'(d) = \frac{1}{\cos^2\frac d R} &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[:wikt:transverse|transverse]] scale

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\cos\frac d R} &lt;/math&gt;

so the transverse scale increases outwardly, and the radial scale even more.

==Use==
Gnomonic projections are used in [[seismic]] work because seismic waves tend to travel along great circles. They are also used by [[navy|navies]] in plotting [[direction finding]] bearings, since [[radio]] signals travel along great circles. [[Meteor]]s also travel along great circles, with the Gnomonic [[Atlas Brno 2000.0]] being the [[International Meteor Organization|IMO]]'s recommended set of star charts for visual meteor observations. Aircraft and ship pilots use the projection to find the shortest route between start and destination.

The gnomonic projection is used extensively in [[photography]], where it is called ''[[Rectilinear lens|rectilinear]] projection''.

The gnomonic projection is used in astronomy where the tangent point is centered on the object of interest.  The sphere being projected in this case is the celestial sphere, ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,  and not the surface of the Earth.

Presently, in [[Africa]],  [[Google Street View]] can be seen in parts of [[Botswana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google-africa.blogspot.com/2012/02/street-view-comes-to-beautiful-botswana.html |title=Street View comes to beautiful Botswana |publisher=google-africa.blogspot.com |accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uganda]], [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Senegal]], [[Ghana]], [[Tunisia]], [[Nigeria]], the [[Canary Islands]] of Spain, and [[Egypt]]'s landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/views/streetview/egypt-highlights?gl=us |title=Egypt Highlights |publisher=google.com|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
On September 1, 2009, Google announced that it started collecting images in South Africa for Google Maps Street View.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Google to begin collecting images in South Africa for Google Maps Street View | publisher = TheMarketingSite.com | date = 1 September 2009 | url = http://www.themarketingsite.com/news/9688/google-to-begin-collecting-images-in-south-africa-for-google-maps-street-view | accessdate = 20 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Google is currently driving around South Africa in Toyota Priuses, taking photographs of locations in the cities of [[Johannesburg]], [[Pretoria]], [[Cape Town]], [[Port Elizabeth]], [[Durban]] and [[East London, South Africa|East London]]. Google Trikes are also being used for the first time to map popular tourist destinations, such as the scenic [[Chapman's Peak]] Drive and [[Table Mountain]] in Cape Town, [[Soccer City]] in Johannesburg, and the new [[Moses Mabhida Stadium]] in Durban.
Images of South Africa were made available on Google Street View on June 8, 2010.

On December 8, 2010, more locations in South Africa were added. These were mostly rural and main roads, as well as a much larger coverage of the [[Limpopo]] province. After the update, the borders of South Africa's neighboring countries could be reached.

On September 9, 2014, landmarks in [[Egypt]] were added.

In 2017, the coverage of [[Nigeria]] is planned.

The [[Azores]] have a location with little more unclear connection to a continent. Anyway, the islands of [[São Miguel Island]] and [[Terceira Island]] have good coverage.

{{Politics of Jamaica}}

The '''Governor-General of Jamaica''' represents the [[Monarchy of Jamaica|Jamaican monarch]] and [[head of state]], currently [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

The Queen, on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|Prime Minister]], appoints a governor-general as her representative in [[Jamaica]]. Both The Queen and the [[Governor-General]] hold much power, but rarely exercise it, usually only in emergencies and, in some cases,{{which?|date=February 2014}} war.

The Governor-General represents the monarch on ceremonial occasions such as the State Opening of [[Parliament of Jamaica|Parliament]], the presentation of honours, and military parades. Under the [[Constitution of Jamaica|Constitution]], he or she is given authority to act in some matters, for example in appointing and disciplining officers of the civil service, proroguing Parliament, and so on, but only in a few cases does he or she have the power to act entirely at his or her own discretion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jis.gov.jm/GovernmentOfJamaica.pdf "Government of Jamaica"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606194332/http://www.jis.gov.jm/GovernmentOfJamaica.pdf |date=6 June 2007 }}, Jamaica Information Service&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republicanism in Jamaica|Jamaican republicanism]], a position which is held by the current Jamaican government, generally advocates for the replacement of the Governor-General with a president.

'''Marcel-Henri Gaussen''' (14 July 1891 in [[Cabrières-d'Aigues]] ([[Vaucluse]]) - 27 July 1981 in [[Toulouse]]), was a French [[botanist]] and [[biogeographer]].
[[Image:MHNT Jardin Henri Gaussen.jpg|thumb|right|290px|&lt;center&gt;[[Muséum de Toulouse]] - '''Jardin botanique Henri Gaussen''' - La spirale ethnobotanique.&lt;/center&gt;]]

In 1926, he defended his thesis on "the vegetation of the eastern half of the [[Pyrenees]]", which laid the foundation for future work on the border between [[biogeography]] and vegetation mapping. Gaussen was an early advocate of the ideas of stages and [[ecological succession|vegetation succession]], which are fundamental to [[phytogeography]]. His work allowed for the production of a vegetation map of France at a scale of 1/200 000 (completed after his death by the service of the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]], but which he had created and directed) and many similar projects in other countries. His work led to many advanced phytogeographic tools such as "Gaussen index", the "xerothermic index" and "ombrothermic diagram ". As recognition for his scientific work in mapping of vegetation cover and [[ecology]], he received in 1971 the Grand Prix of the [[Société de Géographie|Geographical Society]] for geographical research and publications.

He was also responsible for the creation in 1922 of the [[Arboretum de Jouéou]], and for the strength and reputation of teaching and research in botany at the [[University of Toulouse]]. A great traveller, he was also the creator of a science section at the [[French Institute of Pondicherry]]. He worked with [[Flora Europaea]] as a regional adviser for France.

Henri Gaussen spent his entire career as a professor at Toulouse, where he was also in 1958 elected as a "mainteneur" (council member) of the [[Académie des Jeux floraux]]. 

Having accumulated an impressive number of personal photographs, he donated his collection to the archives of the department of [[Haute-Garonne]], where they can still be viewed.&lt;ref name=photos&gt;[http://www-sv.cict.fr/gaussen/gausse.html Henri Gaussen database, founded on photos taken by himself] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325084217/http://www-sv.cict.fr/gaussen/gausse.html |date=2013-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Villandry Jardins style Renaissance.jpg|thumb|325px| &lt;center&gt; The [[renaissance]] style gardens at [[Chateau Villandry]].&lt;/center&gt; ]]

The '''history of ornamental gardening''' may be considered as [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] expressions of beauty through art and nature, a display of taste or style in civilized life, an expression of an individual's or culture's philosophy, and sometimes as a display of private [[Social status|status]] or [[Patriotism|national pride]]—in private and public landscapes.

The enclosure of outdoor space began in 10,000 BC. Though no one knows the specific details of the first garden, historians imagine the first enclosure was a type of barrier for excluding animals and marauders. Garden construction and design was a primary precursor to landscape architecture, and it began in West Asia, eventually spreading westward into Greece, Spain, Germany, France, Britain, etc. The modern words of "garden" and "yard" are descendants of the Old English "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/geard geard]", which denotes a fence or enclosure.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Tom|title=Garden history: Philosophy and design 2000 BC–2000 AD.|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vitruvius]], a Roman author and engineer, wrote the oldest extant design manual in 27 BC. ''[[De architectura|De architectura libri decem]]'' (''Ten Books on Architecture'') addressed design theory, landscape architecture, engineering, water supply, and public projects, such as parks and squares. Vitruvius asserted that ''firmitas'' (firmness, durability, strength), ''utilitas'' (commodity, convenience, utility) and ''venustas'' (delight, loveliness, beauty) were the primary objectives of design. Some still consider these elements essential to quality design of landscape.&lt;ref name=Turner /&gt;

After the emergence of the first civilizations, wealthy persons began to create gardens for purely aesthetic purposes. [[Egypt]]ian [[tomb painting]]s of the 16th century BC are some of the earliest physical evidence of ornamental [[horticulture]] and landscape design; they depict [[Egyptian lotus|lotus]] ponds surrounded by symmetrical rows of [[acacia]]s and [[palm tree|palms]]. Another ancient tradition is of [[Persian people|Persia]]: [[Darius the Great]] was said to have had a "[[paradise garden]]" and the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] were renowned as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Persian gardens were designed along a central [[axis of symmetry]].

Persian influences extended to [[Hellenistic Greece]] after [[Alexander the Great]]. C. 350 BC there were gardens at the [[Platonic Academy|Academy of Athens]], and [[Theophrastus]], who wrote on [[botany]], supposedly inherited a garden from [[Aristotle]]. [[Epicurus]] had a garden where he walked and taught, and he bequeathed it to [[Hermarchus]] of [[Mytilene]]. [[Alciphron]] also referenced private gardens in his writing.

The most influential ancient gardens in the western world were those of [[Ptolemy]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]] and the horticultural tradition that [[Lucullus]] brought to [[Rome]]. [[Wall painting]]s in [[Pompeii]], [[Italy]] attest to later elaborate development. The wealthiest Romans built extensive villa gardens with water features, including fountains and rivulets, [[topiary]], roses, and shaded arcades. Archeological evidence survives at sites such as [[Hadrian's Villa]].

[[Byzantium]] and Moorish Spain continued horticultural traditions after the 4th century AD and the decline of Rome. By this time, a separate horticultural tradition formed in [[China]], which was transmitted to [[Japan]], where it developed into aristocratic gardens featuring miniaturized and simulated natural landscapes centered on ponds, and the severe [[Zen garden]] form featured at temples.

In Europe, gardening revived in [[Languedoc]] and the [[Île-de-France]] in the 13th century. The rediscovery of descriptions of antique Roman villas and gardens led to the creation of a new form of garden, the [[Italian Renaissance garden]] in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The Spanish Crown built the first [[public park]]s of this era in the 16th century, both in Europe and the Americas. The formal [[garden à la française]], exemplified by the [[Gardens of Versailles]], became the dominant horticultural style in Europe until the middle of the 18th century, when the [[English landscape garden]] and the [[French landscape garden]] acceded to dominance. In the 19th century a welter of historical revivals and Romantic cottage-inspired gardening emerged. In [[England]], [[William Robinson (gardener)|William Robinson]] and [[Gertrude Jekyll]] were influential proponents of the wild garden and the [[perennial garden]], respectively. [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] and [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] adapted European forms for North America, especially influencing the design of [[public parks]], campuses and suburban landscapes. Olmsted's influence extended well into the 20th century.

==The historical development of garden styles==
===Mesopotamian Gardens===
[[File:tigr-euph.png|thumb|right|200px|Map showing the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers]]
Mesopotamia - the "land between the Rivers" Tigris and Euphrates - comprises a hilly and mountainous northern area and a flat, alluvial south. Its peoples ([[Sumer|Sumerians]], [[Akkadians]], [[Assyria]]ns, and [[Babylonia]]ns) were urban and literate from about 3,000BC. Evidence for their gardens comes from written texts, pictorial sculpture and archaeology. In western tradition Mesopotamia was the location of the [[Garden of Eden]] and the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]]. Temple gardens developed from the representation of a sacred grove; several distinct styles of royal garden are also known.&lt;ref&gt;Dalley Stephanie, (1993) "Ancient Mesopotamian Gardens" ''Garden History, the Journal of the Garden History Society'', v21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''courtyard garden''' was enclosed by the walls of a palace, or on a larger scale was a cultivated place inside the city walls. At Mari on the Middle Euphrates (c 1,800BC) one of the huge palace courtyards was called the Court of the Palms in contemporary written records. It is crossed by raised walkways of baked brick; the king and his entourage would dine there. At Ugarit (c1,400BC) there was a stone water basin, not located centrally as in later Persian gardens, for the central feature was probably a tree (date palm or tamarisk). The 7th century BC Assyrian king [[Assurbanipal]] is shown on a sculpture feasting with his queen, reclining on a couch beneath an arbour of vines, attended by musicians. Trophies of conquest are on display, including the dismembered head of the king of Elam hanging from a fragrant pine branch. A Babylonian text from the same period is divided into sections as if showing beds of soil with the names of medicinal, vegetable and herbal plants written into each square, perhaps representing a ''parterre'' design.

On a larger scale '''royal hunting parks''' were established to hold the exotic animals and plants which the king had acquired on his foreign campaigns. King [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (c 1,000BC) lists horses, oxen, asses, deer of two types, gazelle and ibex, boasting "I numbered them like flocks of sheep."&lt;ref&gt;Grayson AK, (1991) ''Assyrian Rulers of the Early First Millennium BC'', vol 1, Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia, Assyrian Periods 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

From around 1,000 BC the Assyrian kings developed a style of '''city garden''' incorporating a naturalistic layout, running water supplied from river headwaters, and exotic plants from their foreign campaigns. [[Assurnasirpal II]] (883-859BC) lists pines of different kinds, cypresses and junipers of different kinds, almonds, dates, ebony, rosewood, olive, oak, tamarisk, walnut, terebinth and ash, fir pomegranate, pear, quince, fig and grapevines: "The canal water gushes from above into the gardens; fragrance pervades the walkways; streams of water as numerous as the stars of heaven flow in the pleasure garden.... Like a squirrel I pick fruit in the garden of delights." The city garden reached its zenith with the palace design of [[Sennacherib]] (704-681BC) whose water system stretched for 50&amp;nbsp;km into the hills, whose garden was higher and more ornate than any others, and who boasted of the complex technologies he deployed, calling his palace and garden "a Wonder for all Peoples".

The biblical Book of Genesis mentions the Tigris and Euphrates as two of the four rivers bounding the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 2: 10–14&lt;/ref&gt; No specific place has been identified, although there are many theories.

The [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] are listed by classical Greek writers as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]] – places to see before you die. The excavated ruins of Babylon do not reveal any suitable evidence, which has led some scholars to suggest that they may have been purely legendary.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, Irving (1988) "The Hanging Gardens of Babylon" in ''The seven Wonders of the Ancient World'', ed. Peter Clayton and Martin Price, Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-05036-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively the story may have originated from Sennacherib's garden in [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalley, Stephanie, (2013) ''The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive World Wonder traced'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-966226-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian gardens===
{{main article|Persian gardens}}
[[File:Taj Mahal (Edited).jpeg|thumb|300px| The large ''charbagh'' (a form of Persian garden divided into four parts) provides the foreground for the classic view of the [[Origins and architecture of the Taj Mahal|Taj Mahal]], UNESCO World Heritage Site]]

All Persian gardens, from the ancient to the high classical were developed in opposition to the harsh and arid landscape of the Iranian Plateau. Unlike historical European gardens, which seemed carved or re-ordered from within their existing [[landscape]], Persian gardens appeared as impossibilities. Their ethereal and delicate qualities emphasized their intrinsic contrast to the hostile environment. Trees and [[trellis (architecture)|trellis]]es largely feature as biotic shade; [[pavilion]]s and [[wall]]s are also structurally prominent in blocking the sun.
 
The heat also makes [[water]] important, both in the design and maintenance of the garden. [[Irrigation]] may be required, and may be provided via a form of underground tunnel called a [[qanat]], that transports water from a local [[aquifer]]. Well-like structures then connect to the qanat, enabling the drawing of water. Alternatively, an animal-driven Persian well would draw water to the surface. Such wheel systems also moved water around surface water systems, such as those in the chahar bāgh style. Trees were often planted in a ditch called a juy, which prevented water evaporation and allowed the water quick access to the tree roots.
 
The Persian style often attempts to integrate indoors with outdoors through the connection of a surrounding garden with an inner courtyard. Designers often place architectural elements such as vaulted arches between the outer and interior areas to open up the divide between them.

===Egyptian gardens===
{{See also|Gardens of Ancient Egypt}}
[[Image:Le_Jardin_de_Nébamoun.jpg|thumb|left|Rectangular fishpond with ducks and [[Lotus (plant)|lotus]] planted round with date palms and fruit trees, in a fresco from the Tomb of Nebamun, Thebes, 18th Dynasty]]

Gardens were much cherished in the Egyptian times and were kept both for secular purposes and attached to temple compounds. Gardens in private homes and villas before the New Kingdom were mostly used for growing vegetables and located close to a canal or the river. However, in the New Kingdom they were often surrounded by walls and their purpose incorporated pleasure and beauty besides utility.
Garden produce made out an important part of foodstuff but flowers were also cultivated for use in garlands to wear at festive occasions and for medicinal purposes. While the poor kept a patch for growing vegetables, the rich people could afford gardens lined with sheltering trees and decorative pools with fish and waterfowl. There could be wooden structures forming pergolas to support vines of grapes from which raisins and wine were produced. There could even be elaborate stone kiosks for ornamental reasons, with decorative statues.
[[Image:FuneraryModel-Garden MetropolitanMuseum.png|thumb|upright|A funerary model of a garden, dating to the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt]], c. 2009–1998 BC. Made of painted and gessoed wood, originally from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].]]
Temple gardens had plots for cultivating special vegetables, plants or herbs considered sacred to a certain deity and which were required in rituals and offerings like lettuce to Min. Sacred groves and ornamental trees were planted in front of or near both cult temples and mortuary temples. As temples were representations of heaven and built as the actual home of the god, gardens were laid out according to the same principle. Avenues leading up to the entrance could be lined with trees, courtyards could hold small gardens and between temple buildings gardens with trees, vineyards, flowers and ponds were maintained.

The ancient Egyptian garden would have looked different from a modern garden. It would have seemed more like a collection of herbs or a patch of wild flowers, lacking the specially bred flowers of today. Flowers like the iris, chrysanthemum, lily and delphinium (blue), were certainly known to the ancients but do not feature much in garden scenes. Formal boquets seem to have been composed of mandrake, poppy, cornflower and or lotus and papyrus.

Due to the arid climate of Egypt, tending gardens meant constant attention and depended on irrigation. Skilled gardeners were employed by temples and households of the wealthy. Duties included planting, weeding, watering by means of a shaduf, pruning of fruit trees, digging the ground, harvesting the fruit etc.

===Hellenistic and Roman gardens===
{{Further information|Greek gardens|Roman gardens}}

====Hellenistic gardens====
It is curious that although the Egyptians and Romans both gardened with vigor, the Greeks did not own private gardens. They did put gardens around temples and they adorned walkways and roads with statues, but the ornate and pleasure gardens that demonstrated wealth in the other communities is seemingly absent.
[[Image:Ricostruzione del giardino della casa dei vetii di pompei (mostra al giardino di boboli, 2007) 01.JPG|thumb|250px|Reconstruction of the Roman garden of the [[House of the Vettii]] in [[Pompeii]]]]

====Roman gardens====
Roman gardens were a place of peace and solitude, a refuge from urban life. Ornamental horticulture became highly developed during the development of Roman civilization. The administrators of the Roman Empire (c.100 BC - 500 AD) actively exchanged information on agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, hydraulics, and botany. Seeds and plants were widely shared. The Gardens of Lucullus (Horti Lucullani) on the Pincian Hill on the edge of Rome introduced the Persian garden to Europe, about 60 BC.

===Chinese and Japanese gardens===
{{Further information|Chinese garden|Japanese garden}}
[[Image:Liuyuan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Chinese scholar's rocks|Rock sculpture]] from the 'Lingering Garden' of [[Suzhou]], China]]
Both [[China|Chinese]] and Japanese garden design traditionally is intended to evoke the natural landscape of mountains and rivers. However, the intended viewpoint of the gardens differs: Chinese gardens were intended to be viewed from within the garden and are intended as a setting for everyday life. Japanese gardens, with a few exceptions, were intended to be viewed from within the house, somewhat like a [[diorama]]. Additionally, Chinese gardens more often included a water feature, while Japanese gardens, set in a wetter climate, would often get by with the suggestion of water. (Such as sand or pebbles raked into a wave pattern.) Traditional Chinese gardens are also more likely to treat the plants in a naturalistic way, while traditional Japanese gardens might feature plants sheared into mountain shapes. This contrasts with the handling of stone elements: in a Japanese garden, stones are placed in groupings as part of the landscape, but in a Chinese garden, a particularly choice stone might even be placed on a pedestal in a prominent location so that it might be more easily appreciated.

====Chinese scholar gardens====
The style of Chinese garden varies among economic groups and differs by dynasties. Rocks, water, bridges and pavilions are among the most common features of scholar gardens for the wealthy classes, while courtyards, wells, and terra cotta fish tanks are common among general population. Other features such as moon gates and leaky windows (openwork screens that pierce surrounding walls) are seen in both groups.

The development of landscape design in China was historically driven by philosophies of both [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]. Geometric symmetry and reinforcement of class boundaries were typical characteristics of landscape design in Asian cities, and both characteristics reflect Confucian ideals. While the British used nature outside the home to provide privacy, Chinese homes were compounds made of a number of buildings which all faced one or more courtyards or common areas. Rather than around the home, the Chinese valued natural spaces inside the compound, which is where the family socialized. Furthermore, Courtyards in the Chinese home reflected Taoist philosophies, where families would try to create abstractions of nature rather than recreations of it. For example, a Taoist garden would avoid straight lines and use stone and water instead of trees, whereas Asian cities followed Confucian, geometric designs and North American parks typically feature trees and lawns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=E.D.|author2=W. Andrew Kenney|title=Cultural background and landscape history as factors affecting perceptions of the urban forest|journal=Journal of Arboriculture|year=2000|volume=26|issue=2|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two ways of looking at the signature design characteristics of the Chinese garden: first, the concept of [[Yin and Yang]] and second, the myths of longevity that arose during the [[Qin Dynasty]].

The philosophy of Yin and Yang portrays the idea of balance and harmony. The Chinese garden expresses the relationship to nature and the idea of balance through the art of mimicking natural setting, thus the existence of mountains, rocks, water, and wind elements. Yin and Yang juxtapose complementary opposites: as hard as rock can be, the softness of water can dissolve it. [[Lake Tai]] rocks, limestone eroded by the water of Lake Tai, are the quintessential example. Water, air and light run through the rock as it sit still on display. The leaky windows of the Chinese garden wall portray both steadiness and movement. The windows create a solid painting on walls, however that steadiness changes once the wind blows or the eyes move.

Chinese garden's structure is based upon the culture's creation myth, rooted in rocks and water. To have longevity is to live among mountains and water; it is to live with nature, to live like an immortal being (Xian). The garden evokes a healthy lifestyle that makes one immortal, free from the problems of civilization. Thus, Chinese landscape is known as Shan (mountain) and Shui (water). (Add Roger's citation).

Symbolism is a key element of Chinese garden design. To the earthy tones of the Chinese garden, a touch of red or gold is often added to bring forth the Yin/Yang contrast. The colors red and gold also represent luck and wealth. Bats, dragons and other mystic creatures carved on wooden doors are also commonly found in Chinese gardens; these are signs of luck and protection.

Circles portray togetherness, especially for family members, and are depicted in [[moon gate]]s and round tables placed within square backgrounds. The moon gate and other whimsical doorways also act to frame views and to force the viewer to pause for a transition into a new space.

Paths in Chinese gardens are often uneven and sometimes consciously zigzag. These paths are like the passages of a human life. There is always something new or different when seen from a different angle, while the future is unknown and unpredictable.

===European gardens===
====Gardens of Byzantium====
The [[Byzantine]] empire span a period of more than 1000 years (330–1453 AD) and a geographic area from modern day Spain and Britain to the Middle East and north Africa. Probably due to this temporal and geographic spread and its turbulent history, there is no single dominant garden style that can be labeled "Byzantine style". Archaeological evidence of public, imperial, and private gardens is scant at best and researchers over the years have relied on literary sources to derive clues about the main features of Byzantine gardens. Romance novels such as [[Hysmine and Hysminias]] (12th century) included detailed descriptions of gardens and their popularity attests to the Byzantines’ enthusiasm for pleasure gardens ([[locus amoenus]]). More formal gardening texts such as the [[Geoponika]] (10th century) were in fact encyclopedias of accumulated agricultural practices (grafting, watering) and pagan lore (astrology, plant sympathy/antipathy relationships) going back to [[Hesiod]]'s time. Their repeated publications and translations to other languages well into the 16th century is evidence to the value attributed to the horticultural knowledge of antiquity. These literary sources worked as handbooks promoting the concepts of walled gardens with plants arranged by type. Such ideals found expression in the suburban parks ([[Philopation]], [[Aretai (Constantinople)|Aretai]]) and palatial gardens ([[Mesokepion]], [[Mangana (Constantinople)|Mangana]]) of Constantinople.

The Byzantine garden tradition was influenced by the strong undercurrents of history that the empire itself was exposed to. The first and foremost influence was the adoption of Christianity as the empire's official religion by its founder Constantine I. The new religion signaled a departure from the ornamental pagan sculptures of the Greco-Roman garden style. The second influence was the increasing contact with the Islamic nations of the Middle East especially after the 9th century. Lavish furnishings in the emperor's palace and the adoption of [[automata]] in the palatial gardens are evidence of this influence. The third factor was a fundamental shift in the design of the Byzantine cities after the 7th century when they became smaller in size and population as well as more ruralized. The class of wealthy aristocrats who could finance and maintain elaborate gardens probably shrank as well. The final factor was a shifting view toward a more "enclosed" garden space ([[hortus conclusus]]); a trend dominant in Europe at that time. The open views and vistas so much favored by the garden builders of the Roman villas were replaced by garden walls and scenic views painted on the inside of these walls. The concept of the heavenly paradise was an enclosed garden gained popularity during that time and especially after the iconoclastic period (7th century) with the emphasis it placed on divine punishment and repentance.

An area of horticulture that flourished throughout the long history of Byzantium was that practiced by monasteries. Although archaeological evidence has provided limited evidence of monastic horticulture, a great deal can be learned by studying the foundation documents (τυπικόν, [[typikon]]) of the numerous Christian monasteries as well as the biographies of saints describing their gardening activities. From these sources we learn that monasteries maintained gardens outside their walls and watered them with complex irrigation systems fed by springs or rainwater. These gardens contained vineyards, broadleaf vegetables, and fruit trees for the sustenance of monks and pilgrims alike. The role of the gardener was frequently assumed by monks as an act of humility. Monastic horticultural practices established at that time are still in use in Christian monasteries throughout Greece and the Middle East.

====Medieval====
{{Main article|Medieval gardening}}
Monasteries carried on a tradition of garden design and intense horticultural techniques during the medieval period in Europe. Rather than any one particular horticultural technique employed, it is the variety of different purposes the monasteries had for their gardens that serves as testament to their sophistication. As for gardening practices, records are limited, and there are no extant monastic gardens that are entirely true to original form. There are, however, records and plans that indicate the types of garden a monastery might have had, such as those for [[St. Gall]] in Switzerland.

Generally, monastic garden types consisted of kitchen gardens, infirmary gardens, cemetery orchards, cloister garths and vineyards. Individual monasteries might also have had a "green court", a plot of grass and trees where horses could graze, as well as a cellarer's garden or private gardens for obedientiaries, monks who held specific posts within the monastery.

From a utilitarian standpoint, vegetable and herb gardens helped provide both alimentary and medicinal crops, which could be used to feed or treat the monks and, in some cases, the outside community. As detailed in the plans for St. Gall, these gardens were laid out in rectangular plots, with narrow paths between them to facilitate collection of yields. Often these beds were surrounded with wattle fencing to prevent animals from entry. In the kitchen gardens, fennel, cabbage, onion, garlic, leeks, radishes, and parsnips might be grown, as well as peas, lentils and beans if space allowed for them. The infirmary gardens could contain ''[[Rosa gallica]]'' ("The Apothecary Rose"), savory, costmary, fenugreek, rosemary, peppermint, rue, iris, sage, bergamot, mint, lovage, fennel and cumin, amongst other herbs.

The herb and vegetable gardens served a purpose beyond that of production, and that was that their installation and maintenance allowed the monks to fulfill the manual labor component of the religious way of life prescribed by [[Rule of St. Benedict]].

Orchards also served as sites for food production and as arenas for manual labor, and cemetery orchards, such as that detailed in the plan for St. Gall, showed yet more versatility. The cemetery orchard not only produced fruit, but manifested as a natural symbol of the garden of Paradise. This bi-fold concept of the garden as a space that met both physical and spiritual needs was carried over to the cloister garth.

The cloister [[wikt:garth|garth]], a claustrum consisting of the viridarium, a rectangular plot of grass surrounded by peristyle arcades, was barred to the laity, and served primarily as a place of retreat, a locus of the ‘vita contempliva’.&lt;ref&gt;(Stokstad and Stannard 56)&lt;/ref&gt; The viridarium was often bisected or quartered by paths, and often featured a roofed fountain at the center or side of the garth that served as a primary source for wash water and for irrigation, meeting yet more physical needs. Some cloister gardens contained small fish ponds as well, another source of food for the community. The arcades were used for teaching, sitting and meditating, or for exercise in inclement weather.

There is much conjecture as to ways in which the garth served as a spiritual aid. Umberto Eco describes the green swath as a sort of balm on which a monk might rest weary eyes, so as to return to reading with renewed vigor.&lt;ref&gt;(Turner 123)&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars suggest that, though sparsely planted, plant materials found in the cloister garth might have inspired various religious visions.&lt;ref name="Hindsley 8"&gt;(Hindsley 8)&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency to imbue the garden with symbolic values was not inherent to the religious orders alone, but was a feature of medieval culture in general. The square closter garth was meant to represent the four points of the compass, and so the universe as a whole. As Turner puts it,
{{quote|text=Augustine inspired medieval garden makers to abjure earthliness and look upward for divine inspiration. A perfect square with a round pool and a pentagonal fountain became a microcosm, illuminating the mathematical order and divine grace of the macrocosm (the universe).&lt;ref&gt;(Turner 115)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Walking around the cloister while meditating was a way of devoting oneself to the "path of life";&lt;ref name="Hindsley 8"/&gt; indeed, each of the monastic gardens was imbued with symbolic as well as palpable value, testifying to the ingenuity of its creators.

In the later Middle Ages, texts, art and literary works provide a picture of developments in garden design. During the late 12th to 15th centuries, European cities were walled for internal defense and to control trade. Though space within these walls was limited, surviving documents show that there were animals, fruit trees and kitchen gardens inside the city limits.

[[Pietro Crescenzi]], a Bolognese lawyer, wrote twelve volumes on the practical aspects of farming in the 13th century and they offer a description of medieval gardening practices. From his text we know that gardens were surrounded with stonewalls, thick hedging or fencing and incorporated trellises and arbors. They borrowed their form from the square or rectangular shape of the cloister and included square planting beds.

Grass was also first noted in the medieval garden. In the ''De Vegetabilibus'' of [[Albertus Magnus]] written around 1260, instructions are given for planting grass plots. Raised banks covered in turf called "Turf Seats" were constructed to provide seating in the garden. Fruit trees were prevalent and often grafted to produce new varieties of fruit. Gardens included a raised mound or mount to serve as a stage for viewing and planting beds were customarily elevated on raised platforms.

Two works from the late Middle Ages discuss plant cultivation. In the English poem "The Feate of Gardinage" by [[Jon Gardener]] and the general household advice given in [[Le Ménagier de Paris]] of 1393, a variety of herbs, flowers, fruit trees and bushes were listed with instructions on their cultivation. The Menagier provides advice by season on sowing, planting and grafting. The most sophisticated gardening during the Middle Ages was done at the monasteries. Monks developed horticultural techniques, and cultivated herbs, fruits and vegetables. Using the medicinal herbs they grew, monks treated those suffering inside the monastery and in surrounding communities.

During the Middle Ages, gardens were thought to unite the earthly with the divine. The enclosed garden as an allegory for paradise or a "lost Eden" was termed the ''[[Hortus Conclusus]]''. Freighted with religious and spiritual significance, enclosed gardens were often depicted in the visual arts, picturing the Virgin Mary, a fountain, a unicorn and roses inside an enclosed area.

Though Medieval gardens lacked many of the features of the Renaissance gardens that followed them, some of the characteristics of these gardens continue to be incorporated today.

====The Renaissance====

====French Baroque====
[[Image:Andre-Le-Nostre1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Portrait of André Le Nôtre (12 March 1613-15 September 1700) by Carlo Maratta]]

{{Main article|Garden à la française}}
*The [[Garden à la française]], or Baroque French gardens, in the tradition of [[André Le Nôtre]].

The French Classical garden style, or [[Garden à la française]], climaxed during the reign of [[Louis XIV]] of France (1638–1715) and his head gardener of [[Gardens of Versailles]], [[André Le Nôtre]] (1613–1700). The inspiration for these gardens initially came from the [[Italian Renaissance garden]] of the 14th and 15th centuries and ideas of French philosopher [[René Descartes]] (1576–1650). At this time the French opened the garden up to enormous proportions compared to their Italian predecessor. Their gardens epitomize monarch and 'man' dominating and manipulating nature to show his authority, wealth, and power.&lt;ref&gt;(Rogers, 165-167)&lt;/ref&gt;

Renée Descartes, the founder of analytical geometry, believed that the natural world was objectively measurable and that space is infinitely divisible. His belief that "all movement is a straight line therefore space is a universal grid of mathematical coordinates and everything can be located on its infinitely extendable planes" gave us Cartesian mathematics. Through the classical French gardens this coordinate system and philosophy is now given a physical and visual representation.&lt;ref&gt;(Rogers, 166)&lt;/ref&gt;

This French formal and axial garden style placed the house centrally on an enormous and mainly flat property of land. A large central axis that gets narrower further from the main house, forces the viewer's perspective to the horizon line, making the property look even larger. The viewer is to see the property as a cohesive whole but at the same time is unable to see all the components of the garden. One is to be led through a logical progression or story and be surprised by elements that aren’t visible until approached. There is an allegorical story referring to the owner through statues and water features which have mythological references. There are small, almost imperceptible grade changes that help conceal the gardens surprises as well as elongate the gardens views.&lt;ref&gt;(Rogers, 169-179)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mediterranean Gardens====
Due to being an early hub for Western society and being used for centuries, Mediterranean soil was fragile, and one could think of the region’s landscape culture to be a conflict between fruitfulness and frugality. The area consisted largely of small-scale agricultural plots. Later, following [[World War II]], Mediterranean immigrants brought this agricultural style to Canada, where fruit trees and vegetables in the backyard became common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=E.D.|author2=W. Andrew Kenney|title=Cultural background and landscape history as factors affecting perceptions of the urban forest|journal=Journal of Arboriculture|year=2000|volume=26|issue=2|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Picturesque and English Landscape gardens====
{{Main article|English garden|Landscape garden|French landscape garden}}
Forested areas played a number of roles for the British in the Middle Ages, and one of those roles was to produce game for the [[gentry]]. Lords of valuable land were expected to provide a bounty of animals for hunting during royal visits. Despite being in natural locations, forested manor homes could symbolize status, wealth and power if they appeared to have all amenities. After the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain’s forest industry shrank until it no longer existed. In response, the [[Garden City Movement]] brought urban planning into industrialized areas in the early 20th century to offset negative industrial effects such as pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=E.D.|author2=W. Andrew Kenney|title=Cultural background and landscape history as factors affecting perceptions of the urban forest|journal=Journal of Arboriculture|year=2000|volume=26|issue=2|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several traditions that influenced English gardening in the 18th century, the first of which was to plant woods around homes. By the mid-17th century, [[coppice]] planting became consistent and was considered visually and aesthetically pleasing. Whereas forested areas were more useful for hunting purposes in Britain during the Middle Ages, 18th century patterns demonstrate a further deviation in gardening approach from practicality toward design meant to please the senses.&lt;ref name=Phibbs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phibbs|first=John|title=The Persistence of Older Traditions in Eighteenth-Century Gardening|journal=Garden History|year=2009|volume=37|issue=2|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, English pleasure grounds were influenced by medieval groves, some of which were still in existence in 18th century Britain. This influence manifest in the form of shrubbery, sometimes organized in mazes or maze-like formations. And though also ancient, [[Shredding (tree-pruning technique)|shredding]] became a common characteristic of these early gardens, as the method enabled light to enter the [[understory]]. Shredding was used to make garden [[grove (nature)|grove]]s, which ideally included an orchard with fruit trees, fragrant herbs and flowers, and moss-covered pathways.&lt;ref name=Phibbs /&gt;

The picturesque garden style emerged in England in the 18th century, one of the growing currents of the larger [[Romantic movement]]. Garden designers like [[William Kent]] and [[Capability Brown]] emulated the allegorical landscape paintings of European artists, especially [[Claude Lorraine]], [[Poussin]] and [[Salvator Rosa]]. The manicured hills, lakes and trees dotted with allegorical temples were sculpted into the land.

By the 1790s there was a reaction against these stereotypical compositions; a number of thinkers began to promote the idea of picturesque gardens. The leader of the movement was landscape theorist [[William Gilpin (clergyman)|William Gilpin]], an accomplished artist known for his realistic depictions of Nature. He preferred the natural landscape over the manicured and urged designers to respond to the topography of a given site. He also noted that while classical beauty was associated with the smooth and neat, picturesque beauty had a wilder, untamed quality. The picturesque style also incorporated architectural follies—castles, Gothic ruins, rustic cottages—built to add interest and depth to the landscape

Controversy between the picturesque school and proponents of the more manicured garden raged well into the 19th century. Landscape designer [[Humphry Repton]] supported Gilpin's ideas, particularly that of the garden harmonizing with surrounding landforms. He was attacked in the press by two rival theorists, [[Richard Payne Knight]] and [[Uvedale Price]]. Repton countered by highlighting the differences between painting and landscape gardening, [[William Shenstone]] has been credited with coining the term ‘landscape gardening’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/shenstone-and-the-creation-of-the-natural-landscape/&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a painting, the viewer moves through a garden, constantly shifting viewpoints.

The [[French landscape garden]], also called the ''jardin anglais'' or ''jardin pittoresque'', was influenced by contemporary English gardens. Rococo features like Turkish tents and Chinese bridges are prevalent in French gardens in the 18th century. The French Picturesque garden style falls into two categories: those that were staged, almost like theatrical scenery, usually rustic and exotic, called ''jardin anglo-chinois'', and those filled with pastoral romance and bucolic sentiment, influenced by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. The former style is represented by the [[Désert de Retz]] and [[Parc Monceau]], the latter by the [[Moulin Jolie]].

The rusticity found in French picturesque gardens is also derived from admiration of Dutch 17th-century landscape painting and works of the French 18th-century artists [[Claude-Henri Watelet]], [[François Boucher]] and [[Hubert Robert]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Elizabeth Barlow. ''Landscape Design''. New York: Harry N. Abrams, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[English garden]] is the common term in the English-speaking world for interpretations, derivations, and revivals in the style of the original Landscape Garden examples.

===="Gardenesque" gardens====
The "[[Gardenesque]]" style of English garden design evolved during the 1820s from Humphry Repton's Picturesque or "Mixed" style, largely through the efforts of [[J. C. Loudon]], who invented the term.

In a Gardenesque plan, all trees, shrubs and other plants are positioned and managed in such a way that the character of each plant can be displayed to its full potential. With the spread of botany as a suitable subject of study for the enlightened, the Gardenesque tended to emphasize botanical curiosities and a collector's approach. New plant material that would have seemed bizarre and alien in earlier gardening found settings: pampas grass from Argentina and monkey-puzzle trees from Chile, for example. Winding paths linked scattered plantings. The Gardenesque approach involved the creation of small-scale landscapes, dotted with features and vignettes, to promote beauty of detail, variety and mystery, sometimes to the detriment of coherence. Artificial mounds helped to stage groupings of shrubs, and [[island beds]] became prominent features.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===="Wild" gardens and herbaceous borders====
The books of [[William Robinson (gardener)|William Robinson]] describing his own "wild" gardening at [[Gravetye Manor]] in [[Sussex]], and the sentimental picture of a rosy, idealized "cottage garden" of the kind pictured by [[Kate Greenaway]], which had scarcely existed historically, both influenced the development of the mixed herbaceous borders that were advocated by [[Gertrude Jekyll]] at [[Munstead Wood]] in [[Surrey]] from the 1890s. Her plantings, which mixed shrubs with perennial and annual plants and bulbs in deep beds within more formal structures of terraces and stairs designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]], set the model for high-style, high-maintenance gardening until the Second World War. [[Vita Sackville-West]]'s garden at [[Sissinghurst Castle Garden|Sissinghurst Castle]], Kent is the most famous and influential garden of this last blossoming of romantic style, publicized by the gardener's own gardening column in ''[[The Observer]]''. The trend continued in the gardening of [[Margery Fish]] at [[East Lambrook Manor]]. In the last quarter of the 20th century, less structured [[Wildlife gardening]] emphasized the [[ecology|ecological]] framework of similar gardens using native plants. A leading proponent in the United States was the landscape architect [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]]. He designed city and [[regional park]]s, and private [[estate (land)|estates]], with a honed aesthetic of art and nature.

====Pattern gardens: revived parterres====

===Contemporary gardens===
*Romantic [[cottage garden|English cottage garden]] revival
*Modernist gardens
*[[Conservation (ethic)|Naturalistic]] [[Wildlife garden|habitat gardens]]

In the 20th century, modern design for gardens became important as architects began to design buildings and residences with an eye toward innovation and streamlining the formal [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] and derivative early revival styles, removing unnecessary references and embellishment. Garden design, inspired by modern architecture, naturally followed in the same philosophy of "form following function". Thus concerning the many philosophies of plant maturity. In post-war United States people's residences and domestic lives became more outdoor oriented, especially in the western states as promoted by [[Sunset (magazine)|'Sunset Magazine']], with the backyard often becoming an outdoor room.

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] demonstrated his interpretation for the modern garden by designing homes in complete harmony with natural surroundings. [[Taliesin]] and [[Fallingwater]] are both examples of careful placement of architecture in nature so the relationship between the residence and surroundings become seamless. His son [[Lloyd Wright]] trained in architecture and landscape architecture in the [[Olmsted Brothers]] office, with his father, and with architect [[Irving Gill]]. He practiced an innovative organic integration of structure and landscape in his works.

Subsequently, [[Garrett Eckbo]], [[James C. Rose|James Rose]], and Dan Kiley – known as the "bad boys of Harvard" – met while studying traditional landscape architecture became notable pioneers in the design of modern gardens. As Harvard embraced [[Modern architecture|modern design]] in their school of architecture, these designers wanted to interpret and incorporate those new ideas in landscape design. They became interested in developing functional space for outdoor living with designs echoing natural surroundings. Modern gardens feature a fresh mix of curved and architectonic designs and many include abstract art in geometrics and sculpture. Spaces are defined with the thoughtful placement of trees and plantings. [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]] work in [[California]] was influential through his books and other publications. In [[Sonoma County, California]] his 1948 Donnell garden's [[Swimming pool|swimming Pool]], kidney-shaped with an abstract sculpture within it, became an icon of modern outdoor living.

In Mexico [[Luis Barragán]] explored a synthesis of [[International style (architecture)|International style]] modernism with native Mexican tradition. in private estates and residential development projects such as [[Jardines del Pedregal]] ''(English: Rocky Gardens)'' and the San Cristobal 'Los Clubes' Estates in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Fuente de los Amantes.JPG|photo: Fuente de los Amantes]]&lt;/ref&gt; In civic design the [[Torres de Satélite]] are urban sculptures of substantial dimensions in [[Naucalpan|Naucalpan, Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Csatelite.jpg|Photo: Torres de Satélite]]&lt;/ref&gt; His house, studio, and gardens, built in 1948 in Mexico City, was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casaluisbarragan.org/main.html |title=casaluisbarragan.org |publisher=casaluisbarragan.org |accessdate=2010-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924032916/http://www.casaluisbarragan.org/main.html |archivedate=2010-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roberto Burle Marx]] is accredited with having introduced modernist landscape architecture to Brazil. He was known as a modern nature artist and a public urban space designer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/21/arts/design/21burl.html N.Y. Times "A New Look at the Landscaping Artist Roberto Burle Marx"]&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[landscape architect]] (as well as a [[botanist]], [[Painting|painter]], [[print maker]], [[ecologist]], [[naturalist]], artist, and musician) who designed of parks and gardens in Brazil, [[Argentina]], [[Venezuela]], [[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]], and in the United States in [[Florida]]. He worked with the architects [[Lúcio Costa]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] on the landscape design for some of the prominent modernist government buildings in Brazil's capitol [[Brasília]].

==Introduction==

India's remote sensing programme under the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) started off in 1988 with the IRS-1A, the first of the series of indigenous state-of-art operating remote sensing satellites,which was successfully launched into a polar sun-synchronous orbit on March 17, 1988 from the Soviet Cosmodrome at Baikonur. 

It was a proud moment for the country and showed the maturity of the satellites in the various requirements for managing natural resources of the nation. It has sensors like LISS-I which had a spatial resolution of 72.5 meters with a swath of 148 km on ground.  LISS-II had two separate imaging sensors, LISS-II A and LISS-II B, with spatial resolution of 36.25 meters each and mounted on the spacecraft in such a way to provide a composite swath of 146.98 km on ground.These tools quickly enabled India to map, monitor and manage its natural resources at various spatial resolutions. The operational availability of data products to the user organisations further strengthened the relevance of remote sensing applications and management in the country. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Saga of Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System|url=https://www.isro.gov.in/saga-of-indian-remote-sensing-satellite-system}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==IRS System==

Following the successful demonstration flights of [[Bhaskara Satellite series|Bhaskhar and Bhaskara-2]] satellites launched in 1979 and 1981, respectively, India began to develop the indigenous Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite program to support the national economy in the areas of agriculture, water resources, forestry and ecology, geology, water sheds, marine fisheries and coastal management.

Towards this end, India had established the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) for which the [[Department of Space]] (DOS) is the nodal agency, providing operational [[remote sensing]] data services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/spp/guide/india/earth/irs.htm FAS website on IRS]&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the IRS satellites is received and disseminated by several countries all over the world. With the advent of high-resolution satellites new applications in the areas of [[urban sprawl]], infrastructure planning and other large scale applications for mapping have been initiated.

The IRS system is the largest constellation of remote sensing satellites for civilian use in operation today in the world, with 11 operational satellites. All these are placed in polar Sun-synchronous orbit and provide data in a variety of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. Indian Remote Sensing Programme completed its 25 years of successful operations on March 17, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isrsindia.in/controller/forthcoming/Symposium%20Brochure%20for%20Web%2010%20March%202013_2.pdf | title=Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) Series - A SAGA OF 25 YEARS | publisher=Indian Space Research Organisation | accessdate=March 13, 2013 | pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IRS data applications ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Oceansat1LACoast.JPG|thumb|right|Image Oceansat I's chlorophyll concentration of [[Louisiana]] coast '''Source :''' [[Louisiana State University|LSU]].]] --&gt;
Data from Indian Remote Sensing satellites are used for various applications of resources survey and management under the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS). Following is the list of those applications:

* Space Based Inputs for Decentralized Planning (SIS-DP)
* National Urban Information System (NUIS)
* ISRO Disaster Management Support Programme (ISRO-DMSP)
* Biodiversity Characterizations at landscape level- http://bis.iirs.gov.in
* Preharvest crop area and production estimation of major crops.
* Drought monitoring and assessment based on vegetation condition.
* Flood risk zone mapping and flood damage assessment.
* Hydro-geomorphological maps for locating underground water resources for drilling well.
* Irrigation command area status monitoring
* Snow-melt run-off estimates for planning water use in down stream projects
* Land use and land cover mapping
* Urban planning
* Forest survey
* Wetland mapping
* Environmental impact analysis
* Mineral Prospecting
* Coastal studies
* Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (initiated in 1992) for generating locale-specific prescriptions for integrated land and water resources development in 174 districts.
* North Eastern District Resources Plan (NEDRP)- www.nedrp.gov.in

==IRS launch log==

The initial versions are composed of the 1 (A,B,C,D). The later versions are named based on their area of application including OceanSat, CartoSat, ResourceSat. Some of the satellites have alternate designations based on the launch number and vehicle (P series for PSLV).

Following are the remote sensing satellites planned by [[ISRO]] to be launched next strengthening the  fleet of IRS satellites and widening their applications:&lt;ref name="report 2007"&gt;[http://www.isro.org/rep2007/Earth%20Observation.htm IRS Satellites in ISRO annual report of year 2006-07] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408065110/http://www.isro.org/rep2007/Earth%20Observation.htm |date=2009-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ps&gt;[http://planningcommission.nic.in:80/aboutus/committee/wrkgrp11/wg11_subspace.pdf Eleventh Five Year Plan For Indian Space Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''RESOURCESAT-3''': A follow on to Resourcesat-2, it will carry more advanced LISS-III-WS (Wide Swath) Sensor having similar swath and revisit capability as Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS), thus overcoming any spatial resolution limitation of AWiFS. Satellite would also carry [[Atmospheric correction|Atmospheric Correction Sensor]] (ACS) for quantitative interpretation and geophysical parameter retrieval. It slated to be launched during 2021
&lt;ref name=ps/&gt;

* '''[[CARTOSAT-3]]''': A continuation of Cartosat series, it will have a resolution 30&amp;nbsp;cm and 6&amp;nbsp;km swath suitable for cadastre and infrastructure mapping and analysis. It would also enhance disaster monitoring and damage assessment. It is slated to be launched during 2018.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://database.eohandbook.com/database/missionsummary.aspx?missionID=565 CEOS EO HANDBOOK – MISSION SUMMARY  - CARTOSAT-3]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''OCEANSAT-3''': Oceasat-3 would carry Thermal IR Sensor, 12 channel Ocean Color Monitor, Scatterometer and Passive Microwave Radiometer. IR Sensor and Ocean Color Monitor would be used in the analysis for operational Potential Fishing Zones. Satellite is mainly for Ocean biology and sea state applications. It is slated to the launched aboard PSLV in 2012-13.&lt;ref name=ps/&gt;

'''Inhaca''' is a [[town|settlement]] in [[Mozambique]], on the subtropical [[Inhaca Island]] (''[[:pt:Ilha da Inhaca|Ilha da Inhaca]]'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) off the [[East Africa]]n coast. Inhaca settlement is centered on a missionary station located about 32&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Maputo]].

==Geography and administration==
The 52&amp;nbsp;km² island separates [[Maputo Bay]] (''Baía de Maputo'') to the west from the Indian Ocean off its eastern shores.  The island's irregular coastline approaches mainland [[Machangulo Peninsula]] at Ponta Torres where a 500m-wide [[tidal race]] separates the two [[Headlands and bays|headland]]s. In administrative terms Inhaca is a municipal district of the municipality of Maputo, while the Machangulo [[peninsula]] is included under the [[Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area]] and is part of the district of [[Matutuíne]], [[Maputo Province]].

==Economy==

A population of about 6,000 people subsist on fishing and agriculture. At low tide women harvest crabs, oysters and fish from the western shallows. At high tide fishing boats leave the island for deeper sea fishing. The island is a popular winter destination of South African tourists.

==History==

Tsonga chief Nhaca, a protector of early shipwrecked Portuguese sailors, lends his name to the later settlement. Later 16th century Portuguese traders established an Inhaca Island base to ply the [[Maputo Bay|Bay of the Lagoon]]'s (''Baía da Lagoa'') rivers in search of ivory. A 1747 map by [[Emanuel Bowen]] records 'Inhaqua' settlement on the mainland peninsula while referring to the island as 'I. S. Maria'.

The first light house dates from 1894, and was upgraded in the 1920s. A marine biological station (the 'MBS') &lt;small&gt;{{coord|26|02|17|S|32|54|12|E|}}&lt;/small&gt; was built in 1951 and some of the shores were declared nature reserves in 1976. Of late the biological station came under administration of the [[Universidade Eduardo Mondlane|Eduardo Mondlane University]].

==Traveller's destinations==
[[Image:delagoa bay.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Maputo Bay from space in January 1990. Inhaca Island and Machangulo Peninsula are clearly visible at the bottom left edge of the bay]]
The Inhacazul Lodge and Pestana Hotel are the main destinations of travellers from where different excursions are often undertaken, including [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkelling]] outings. [[backpacking (wilderness)|Backpackers]] mostly visit a catering camping area within walking distance of the landing jetty, and are required to take bottled water and their own tents. Inhaca village is within a 5 minute drive from the camp where there are two restaurants, two bars, a grocery store and a marketplace.

The Island can be visited by means of a Ferry which departs from the Porto de Pesca, Maputo at 8:00 and returns at 15:00 every Saturday and Sunday. Travellers reach the island's landing jetty at high tide, but have to wade some sandy shallows during low tide. 

There are also return flights that depart from Maputo airport and these 18 seater planes reach the island airstrip in fifteen minutes.

Ann Pouder ([[London]], [[United Kingdom]] April 8, 1807 – [[Baltimore, Maryland]], [[United States]] July 10, 1917) was one of the first modernly recognized [[British Americans|British American supercentenarians]].  Her age at death was {{age in years and days|1807|4|8|1917|7|10}}.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Young, Louis Epstein, L. Stephen Coles. Rejuvenation Research. August 2008, 11(4): 851–852. {{doi|10.1089/rej.2008.0777}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Pouder was twelve years old, her family emigrated to the United States. There she lived the following 98 years of her life in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. She married [[Nepalese Americans|Nepalese American]] Citizen Alexander Poudar, although became a widow very early and had no children. Her extreme longevity claim was certified by [[Alexander Graham Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grg.org/Adams/Tables.htm GRG Official Tables, Notes for Table A.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818043705/http://www.grg.org/Adams/Tables.htm |date=August 18, 2010 }} (This document mentions a report that Ann Pouder's lifespan was validated by Alexander Graham Bell.)

Her parents were Charles Woodruff Bidwell and Alice Beach Nobel.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt; She was a descendant of John Bidwell, one of the founders of [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Bidwell worked as a teacher in a [[one-room school house]] for six years. She married Charles Hubbell Bidwell, a distant cousin, in 1906.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;

Bidwell lived on her own in [[North Haven, Connecticut]], until she was 110. Bidwell died at the Arden House, a nursing home in [[Hamden, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=ssdi/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news |title=Oldest person in the U.S. still teaching life lessons |url=http://cgi.cnn.com/US/9512/oldest_american/ |publisher=CNN |quote=Mary Bidwell has a long memory because she has had a long life.

=== Maggie Barnes ===
Maggie Pauline Barnes née Hinnant (March 6, 1882 – January 19, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | pages=298 - 299 | first1=Bernard | last1=Jeune | title=Supercentenarians (Demographic Research Monographs) | chapter=Jeanne Calment and her Successors. |editor1-first=Heiner |editor1-last=Maier | publisher=Springer |date=May 2010 | ISBN=978-3-642-11519-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American supercentenarian. She was a resident of [[Johnston County, North Carolina]]. Barnes died from complications following a minor foot infection.&lt;ref name="RNOmb"&gt;Musante, Glenna B. (January 22, 1998) "Johnston woman, one of world's oldest, dies at 117" ''[[The Raleigh News &amp; Observer]]. Section: News; B1.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes, who was born to a slave and married a [[tenant farmer]], was survived by four children; 11 of her children preceded her in death.&lt;ref name="RNOmb"/&gt;

Some dispute exists as to her date of birth. Though the 1882 date is written in the family's bible, the 1900 US Census lists her as having been born in 1881, and her [[marriage license]] says she was born in 1880.&lt;ref name="RNOmb"/&gt; Authenticating to the latest of those dates, Barnes was 115 years, 319 days old when she died.

Benkner was born in [[Leipzig]], Germany, and [[immigration to the United States|emigrated to the U.S.]] in 1896. She grew up in [[Peekskill, New York]], where her family ran the ''Albert Hotel'', and as a young woman once met then [[President of the United States]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="cbsnews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bischoff 2005"&gt;{{cite web | last=Bischoff | first=Katrin | title=Frieda Müller, der älteste Mensch in Deutschland, ist am Donnerstag in Potsdam gestorben: 110 Jahre, neun Monate und drei Tage | website=Berliner Zeitung | date=2005-07-23 | url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/frieda-mueller--der-aelteste-mensch-in-deutschland--ist-am-donnerstag-in-potsdam-gestorben-110-jahre--neun-monate-und-drei-tage-15753738 | language=de | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On her 1908 marriage to Karl Benkner, she moved west, living in [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ohio]] before retiring to [[Arizona]].

=== Emma Verona Johnston ===
Emma Verona Johnston (née Calhoun) (August 6, 1890 – December 1, 2004) was an [[United States|American]] [[supercentenarian]] who was born in [[Indianola, Iowa]] to a large family.&lt;ref name="EJohnston"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/03/local/me-johnston3|title = Emma Johnston, 114; Ohioan Was Oldest Living American|first = Claudia|last = Luther|newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]]|date = December 3, 2004|accessdate = July 30, 2018}} Also available from the website of the [[Gerontology Research Group]] at [http://www.grg.org/EJohnston.htm OBITUARY: “Emma Johnston, 114; Ohioan Was Oldest Living American”]&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Drake University]] in the Class of 1912 and went on to work as a Latin teacher before her marriage to ophthalmologist Harry Johnston;&lt;ref name = FromClass1912 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Centenarian studied at Drake|last = Hoven|first = Valerie|date = Spring 2004|work = Alumni News section of the Drake University publication "Update"|accessdate = July 30, 2018|url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/digital/collection/du-vj/id/15/rec/1|publisher = Drake University Digital Collections, [[Drake University]] Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Honorary&gt;{{cite web|title = Honorary Degree Nomination|last = Willey|first = John|year = 2004|url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/digital/collection/du-vj/id/19/rec/3|accessdate = July 30, 2018|publisher = Drake University Digital Collections, [[Drake University]] Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of her death, she was the University's oldest living graduate.&lt;ref name = FromClass1912&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lib.drake.edu/heritage/johnston/index.php|title = From the Class of 1912|publisher = Cowles Library at [[Drake University]] (lib.drake.edu)|work = The Drake Heritage Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 98, she moved from [[Iowa]] to [[Ohio]] in order to live with her daughter and son-in-law. She continued to be in good health even after turning 110, still being able to walk up steps, and was also alert and able to engage in conversations.&lt;ref name="GRG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/TableE.html |title=Validated Living Supercentenarians|date=August 29, 2018|accessdate=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the "[[list of the verified oldest people|oldest living American]]" when [[#Charlotte Benkner|Charlotte Benkner]] died on May 14, 2004.

=== Bettie Wilson ===
Bettie Antry Wilson née Rutherford (September 13, 1890 – February 13, 2006)&lt;ref name="Bettie Wilson"&gt;[http://www.grg.org/BWilson1.htm Bettie Wilson, 115; One of Three Oldest Americans] (LA Times)&lt;/ref&gt; was thought to be the oldest verified living person in the United States upon the death of 114-year-old Emma Verona Johnston on December 1, 2004 until the subsequent verification of [[Elizabeth Bolden]]. Both were born in the rural South—where they lived less than 100 miles apart.

Born of freed slaves, Solomon and Delia Rutherford, she is the oldest resident of the state of Mississippi ever recorded (the previous record was 113 years, 12 days set in 1994). In late April 2005, Wilson moved into a new home funded by donations.

Wilson celebrated her 115th birthday in September 2005, at which time she ranked as the third-oldest living person in the world.

Wilson died at her [[New Albany, Mississippi|New Albany]] home on February 13, 2006, aged 115 years, 153 days. She was survived by her son, five grandchildren, 46 great-grandchildren, 95 great-great-grandchildren and 38 great-great-great grandchildren.&lt;ref name="Bettie Wilson" /&gt;

He was also the oldest living man in the United States, following the death of [[Antonio Pierro]] on February 8, 2007. Francis was from [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], but since 1949 lived in [[Sacramento, California]], where a local newspaper published a poem that Francis enjoyed reciting to friends and the public throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Black Man's Plea for Justice |url= http://spontaneousoverflow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/GeorgeFrancisPOEM.source.prod_affiliate.4.pdf|format= PDF |work= The Sacramento Bee |publisher= The McClatchy Company |location= Sacramento, CA |accessdate=November 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He credited his longevity to nature, and enjoyed a rich diet of pork, eggs, milk and lard. He gave up smoking cigars at the age of 75.&lt;ref name="Sacbee"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Magagnini |url=http://www.sacbee.com/101/story/204734.html |title=Life looks good at 110 – A witness to history from Jim Crow to Barack Obama – and a family treasure |work=sacbee.com |date=June 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607234415/http://www.sacbee.com/101/story/204734.html |archivedate=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis attempted to join the army in World War I but was rejected for service in 1918 as being too short and small (he weighed only about 100 pounds (45.35&amp;nbsp;kg)). Despite this, he later was a boxer before becoming a barber and then a chauffeur.&lt;ref name="georgefrancis" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10451">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Saint Martin'''. These are the mammal species in [[Saint Martin]], of which only bats are the native mammals of the island. Apart from bats, many oceanic mammals, exotic mammals species and domesticated species can be found within the island. Two native rodents, [[Blunt-toothed giant hutia]] and [[oryzomyine]] are known to extinct from the island with the impact of humans, where few oryzomyines can be found around archeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesfruitsdemer.org/guides/the-incomplete-guide-to-the-wildlife-of-saint-martin/mammals/ |title=Mammals of Saint Martin |publisher=Les Fruits De Mer |accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| EX ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| EW ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| CR ||'''Critically Endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| EN ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| VU ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| NT ||'''Near Threatened'''|| The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorise it as risking extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.
|-
| LC ||'''Least Concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|-
| DD ||'''Data Deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

This '''list of pre-Columbian cultures''' includes those [[civilization]]s and [[culture]]s of [[the Americas]] which flourished prior to the [[European colonization of the Americas]].

==Cultural characteristics==
[[File:Watson Brake Aerial Illustration HRoe 2014.jpg|thumb|right|[[Watson Brake]], [[Louisiana]], 3500 BC]]
[[File:Tikal-Plaza-And-North-Acropolis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tikal]], [[Guatemala]], [[Maya civilization]].]]
Many [[pre-Columbian]] civilizations established permanent or urban settlements, [[agriculture]], and [[complex society|complex societal hierarchies]].
In North America, indigenous cultures in the [[Lower Mississippi Valley]] during the Middle Archaic period built complexes of multiple mounds, with several in Louisiana dated to 5600–5000 BP (3700 BC–3100 BC). [[Watson Brake]] is considered the oldest, multiple mound complex in the Americas, as it has been dated to 3500 BC.  It and other Middle Archaic sites were built by pre-ceramic, hunter-gatherer societies. They preceded the better known [[Poverty Point culture]] and its [[Poverty Point|elaborate complex]] by nearly 2,000 years.&lt;ref name="Preucel"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ccsmpug-xaoC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Hedgepeth+Middle+Archaic+site&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2wHOzYtK-q&amp;sig=3eKTCzKwSwl-S07zX8S-yEz7yv0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QI2yTou4BsKA2wXlmZHhAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hedgepeth%20Middle%20Archaic%20site&amp;f=false Robert W. Preucel, Stephen A. Mrozowski, ''Contemporary Archaeology in Theory: The New Pragmatism''], John Wiley and Sons, 2010, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The Mississippi Valley mound-building tradition extended into the Late Archaic period, longer than what later southeastern mound building dependent on sedentary, agricultural societies.(Russo, 1996:285)&lt;ref name="Preucel"/&gt;

Some of these civilizations had long ceased to function by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (c. late 15th – early 16th centuries), and are known only through [[archaeology|archaeological]] investigations or [[oral history]] from nations today. Others were contemporary with this period, and are also known from historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Mixtec people|Mixtec]], and [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] had their own written records.  However, most Europeans of the time viewed such texts as heretical and [[Book burning|burned]] most of them. Only a few documents were hidden and thus remain today, leaving modern historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.

From both indigenous American and European accounts and documents, American civilizations at the time of European encounter possessed many impressive attributes, having populous cities, and having developed theories of astronomy and mathematics.

Where they persist, the societies and cultures which gave rise to these civilizations continue to adapt and evolve; they also uphold various traditions and practices which relate back to these earlier times, even if combined with those more recently adopted.

[[Human sacrifice]] was a religious practice principally characteristic of pre-Columbian Aztec civilization, although other Mesoamerican civilizations like the Maya and the Zapotec practiced it as well. The extent of the practice is debated by modern scholars.

A '''log jam''' is an accumulation of large [[wood]] (commonly defined as pieces of wood more than {{cvt|10|cm|in|0}} in diameter and more than {{cvt|1|m|ftin}} long&lt;ref name="Large in-stream wood studies"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wohl|first1=Ellen|title=Large in-stream wood studies: a call for common metrics|journal=[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]|date=April 2010|volume=35|issue=5|pages=618–625|doi=10.1002/esp.1966|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.1966/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; also commonly called [[large woody debris]]) that can span an entire [[stream]] or [[river]] channel.

Historically in North America, large "log rafts" were common across the continent prior to European settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wohl|first1=Ellen|title=A legacy of absence: Wood removal in US rivers|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|date=2014|volume=38|issue=5|pages=637–663|doi=10.1177/0309133314548091|url=http://ppg.sagepub.com/content/38/5/637.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous natural wood raft is the [[Great Raft]] on the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] in [[Louisiana]], which prior to its removal in the 1830s affected between {{cvt|390|and(-)|480|km|mi|-1}} of the main channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wohl|first1=Ellen|title=A legacy of absence: Wood removal in US rivers|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|date=2014|volume=38|issue=5|pages=637–663|doi=10.1177/0309133314548091|url=http://ppg.sagepub.com/content/38/5/637.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that such extensive log rafts may have been common in Europe in prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montgomery|first1=D.R.|last2=Collins|first2=B.D.|last3=Buffington|first3=J.M.|last4=Abbe|first4=T.B.|title=Geomorphic effects of wood in rivers|journal=The ecology and management of wood in world rivers|date=2003|pages=21–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on river geomorphology==
[[File:DeadWoodGoodell Creek Log Jam.jpg|thumb|Log jam in [[Goodell Creek]], Washington]]
Log jams alter [[streamflow|flow]] hydraulics by diverting flow towards the bed or banks, increasing flow resistance and creating upstream pools, diverting flow onto the floodplain and damming the channel causing water to spill over the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbe|first1=T.B.|last2=Montgomery|first2=D.R.|title=Large woody debris jams, channel hydraulics and habitat formation in large rivers|journal=Regulated Rivers Research &amp; Management|date=1996|volume=12|issue=23|pages=201–221|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-1646(199603)12:2/3&lt;201::aid-rrr390&gt;3.3.co;2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manners|first1=R.B.|last2=Doyle|first2=M.W.|last3=Small|first3=M.J.|title=Structure and hydraulics of natural woody debris jams|journal=Water Resources Research|date=2007|volume=43|issue=6|doi=10.1029/2006WR004910}}&lt;/ref&gt; These altered channel hydraulics change local patterns of erosion and [[deposition (sediment)|deposition]], which can create greater variety in local geomorphology and thus create provision and variety of habitat for instream living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurnell|first1=A.M.|last2=Gregory|first2=K.J.|last3=Petts|first3=G.E.|title=The role of coarse woody debris in forest aquatic habitats: Implications for management|journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems|date=1995|volume=5|issue=2|pages=143–166|doi=10.1002/aqc.3270050206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of a log jam against one bank typically concentrates flow in the wood-free portion of the channel, increasing velocity through this section and promoting [[Hydrodynamic scour|scour]] of the riverbed, the formation of channel-spanning log jams can lead to the formation of an upstream pool, water spilling over the structure generating a "plunge pool" immediately downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixon|first1=S.J.|title=A dimensionless statistical analysis of logjam form and process|journal=Ecohydrology|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1117|date=2015|doi=10.1002/eco.1710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydraulic and geomorphological effects of log jams are highly dependent on the slope of the river (and thus the potential power of the stream); in steep channels, log jams tend to form channel-spanning steplike structures with an associated downstream scour pool,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curran|first1=J.C.|last2=Wohl|first2=E.E.|title=Large woody debris and flow resistance in step-pool channels, Cascade Range, Washington|journal=Geomorphology|date=2003|volume=51|issue=1–3|pages=141–157|doi=10.1016/S0169-555X(02)00333-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas, in large lowland rivers with low slopes, log jams tend to be partial structures primarily acting to deflect flow with minimal geomorphological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shields|first1=F.D.|last2=Gippel|first2=C.J.|title=Prediction of effects of woody debris removal on flow resistance|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|date=1995|volume=121|issue=4|pages=341–354|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1995)121:4(341)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on ecology==
Log jams provide important [[fish]] habitat. The pools created and sediment deposited by formation of log jams create prime spawning grounds for many species of [[salmon]]. These pools also provide refuge for fish during low water levels when other parts of a stream may be nearly dry. Log jams can provide refuge, as velocity shelters, during high-flow periods.

It has been suggested that log jams are part of trees acting as ecosystem engineers to alter river habitats to promote tree growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurnell|first1=A.M.|title=Plants as river system engineers|journal=Earth Surface Processes and Landforms|date=2014|volume=39|issue=1|pages=4–25|doi=10.1002/esp.3397}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dynamic [[braided river]]s, such as the [[Tagliamento River]] in Italy where the dominant tree species is [[black poplar]], fallen trees form log jams when they are deposited on bars, fine sediment is deposited around these log jams and sprouting seedlings are able to stabilise [[braid bar]]s and promote the formation of stable islands in the river. These stable islands are then prime areas for establishment of seedlings and further vegetation growth, which in turn can eventually provide more fallen trees to the river and thus form more log jams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurnell|first1=A.M.|last2=Petts|first2=G.E.|title=Trees as riparian engineers: The Tagliamento River, Italy|journal=Earth Surface Processes and Landforms|date=2006|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1558–1574|doi=10.1002/esp.1342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In large rivers in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the United States, it has been shown there is a lifecycle of tree growth and river migration, with large trees falling into the channel as banks erode, then staying in place and acting as focal points for log jam formation. These log jams act as hard points resisting further erosion and channel migration. The areas of floodplain behind these log jams then become stable enough for more large trees to grow which in turn can potentially be log jam anchor points in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=B.D.|last2=Montgomery|first2=D.R|last3=Fetherston|first3=K.L.|last4=Abbe|first4=T.B.|title=The floodplain large-wood cycle hypothesis: A mechanism for the physical and biotic structuring of temperate forested alluvial valleys in the North Pacific coastal ecoregion|journal=Geomorphology|volume=139-140|pages=460–470|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.11.011|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphorical usage==
"Logjam" or "log jam" can be used metaphorically to mean "deadlock" or "impasse." It can either be used more literally, to mean a physical impasse, or more metaphorically, to mean an impasse in a process due to differing opinions, legal or technical issues, etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logjam&lt;/ref&gt; Here are two example sentences:
* "The presence of an ambulance on the side of the highway created a logjam of rubberneckers who just had to have a look" - more literal
* "He was called in to try to break the logjam in the negotiations" - more metaphorical

'''Luis García Sáinz''' ([[Saragossa]], 1894-[[Saragossa]], March 11, 1965) was a pioneer of physical geography in Spain. He was the first professor in Geography en la [[University of Valencia]] and secretary at the [[:es:Instituto Juan Sebastián Elcano|Instituto Juan Sebastián Elcano]]. His final position was professor at the [[University of Barcelona]].

== Teacher of geography ==
He began his academic career studying and practicing as a teacher in Teruel.

In 1917, he was appointed Teacher of Geography at the Ecole Normale of Palma de Mallorca, which he would later direct.

In 1924, he received a grant to study Geography in Switzerland, both comparative and didactic.

In 1925, he stayed at the [[University of Belgrade]] to study with Serbian geographer [[Jovan Cvijić]] areas of evolution in surface and subsurface ice of the Alps and the regions of the Rhine and central Germany.

He was secretary of [[:es:Instituto Juan Sebastián Elcano|Instituto Juan Sebastián Elcano]] of [[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]] after the [[Spanish Civil War]]. This Institute had an important role in the development of Spanish geography study.

== Professor of geography ==
In 1941, he was appointed the first Professor of Physical Geography of the [[University of Valencia]], and secretary on restart the [Instituto Juan Sebastián Elcano]. He belongs to the German School of Spanish Geographers. His last position was as a professor at the [[University of Barcelona]].

In memoria there is a State School in [[Fuentes de Ebro]], CEIP Luis García Sáinz.

== Physical geographer ==
He is part of German School geographers group, influenced by German geographers work in Spain and for their educational training in Germany. As geographers attest [[:es:Horacio Capel|Horacio Capel]] in [http://www.ub.es/geocrit/geo1.htm «Geography after the Spanish Civil War.], and  [[:ca:Vicenç Maria Rosselló i Verger|«Vicenç Maria Rosselló i Verger]] in [http://www.raco.cat/index.php/TreballsSCGeografia/article/viewFile/157279/209171 «Spanish precursors of Physical Geography.]

He was a pioneer in geomorphological research. His writings on the Ebro basin (1927, 1928, 1936 and 1939), areas of erosion, glaciers, storms from the east, the massif of Idubeda, and red soils of Mallorca were most notable.

== Death ==
Luis died in an accident while returning in his car from a court in Madrid on March 11, 1965.

'''Malpaís''' is a term used in the [[Southwestern United States]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], and other Spanish-speaking regions for a rough and barren landscape that consists of relict and largely uneroded [[lava field]]s exhibiting recognizable [[lava flow]]s, [[volcanic cone]]s, and other [[volcanic]] landforms. This type of volcanic landscape is extremely rough and difficult to traverse. It is characteristic of an arid environment because in more humid climates, lava fields are quickly destroyed by weathering and erosion. 

While the term describes many [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric]] places, it is strongly associated with Spanish-speaking countries and the Southwestern United States, where Spanish settlers named this landform.&lt;ref name="Strahler1970a"&gt;Strahler, A. N., 1970, ''Introduction to Physical Geography'', 2nd ed. John Wiley and Sopns. New York, New York. 486 pp. {{ISBN|978-0471831686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"&gt;Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, eds.

==Badlands landform==

The word 'malpaís' in Spanish translates to "[[badland]]," and this describes the area as being extremely rough and difficult to traverse and unusable for crops. Although a malpaís is often another word for the [[badlands]] that form by erosion of sedimentary rocks in the same environment, a malpaís is often associated with such types of [[lava plain]] terrain as found in a [[volcanic field]]. The geology of malpaís terrain is bare to thin layers of soil over lava with sparse vegetation. The lava fields usually consist of [[lava tube]] cave systems, [[sinkhole]]s, [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic]] deposits from [[cinder cone]] volcanoes, and [[Lava|ʻaʻā]]  and [[Lava|pāhoehoe]] lava flows. The lava tubes can vary from intact caves to partial or completely collapsed passages. The collapsed tubes, sinkholes, and jagged ʻaʻā surfaces are what make malpaís terrain so difficult to navigate and cultivate, thereby earning their name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Bruce|title=General Geology and Development of Lava Tubes In New Mexico's El Malpais National Monument|url=http://www.vulcanospeleology.org/sym06/ISV6x14.pdf|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[El Malpaís National Monument]] is an example of this landform in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/elma/faqs.htm El Malpais National Monument - Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are the [[Carrizozo Malpaís]] and [[Jornada del Muerto Volcano]] lava plain, in the [[Tularosa Basin]]'s [[Jornada del Muerto]] Desert. The [[Malpaís de Güímar]] is an example in the Spanish [[Canary Islands]].

==Etymology==

A [[loanword]] from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''malpaís'' is in wide use in [[English language|English]] in the [[southwest United States]].  The literal translation of ''malpaís'' is "badland." Other Spanish terms for badlands are ''[[:es:Tierras baldías|tierras baldías]]'' and ''[[:es:Cárcava|cárcava]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5969">The '''mapcode''' system is a [[spatial reference system]] (not to be confused with the [[Denso mapcode]] system). 
A mapcode is a code consisting of two groups of letters and digits, separated by a dot. It represents a location on the surface of the Earth, within the context of a separately specified country or territory. For example, the entrance to the elevator of the Eiffel Tower in Paris is “France 4J.Q2”. As with addresses, it is often unnecessary to explicitly mention the country.

The mapcode algorithm defines how a [[World Geodetic System#WGS84|WGS 84 coordinate]] (a [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]) can be converted into a mapcode, and vice versa. Mapcodes are supported on [[automotive navigation system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.  Many mapping companies have adopted mapcode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HERE maps joins Mapcode|url=http://360.here.com/2015/07/29/here-boss-lends-support-to-mapcode/|publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design principles==

The mapcode system was designed specifically as a free, brand-less, international standard for representing any location on the surface of the Earth by a short, easy to recognize and remember “code”, usually consisting of between 4 and 7 letters and digits.
The shortness is the key differentiating factor between mapcodes and other location references;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should Mapcodes Replace G.P.S.?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/should-mapcodes-replace-gps|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; more densely populated areas are designated with shorter (4 character) codes.

The brevity of mapcodes was achieved through a combination of several ideas:
* Codes need only be accurate enough for human, every-day use. On the human scale, when you are within a few meters of a destination, you are "there".
* Shorter codes are possible within the context of a particular territory. For example: there are enough different combinations of 9 digits and letters to give every square meter on the surface of the Earth a different code. But to give every square meter within the [[Netherlands]] a unique code, only 6 digits and letters are required.
* Not all codes have to be the same length. Shorter codes are reserved for densely populated areas.
The last idea, especially, yield very good results. For example, although every location within the [[Netherlands]] can be identified by a 6-letter mapcode, half of the Dutch population can be found in about 40 cities and densely populated areas that together comprise less than 6,000 square kilometers. By reserving 5-letter mapcodes for these areas, half of the population can thus be reached with 5 mapcode letters. Since human dwellings and businesses are usually the more relevant locations in daily human life, this means that the relevant locations in the [[Netherlands]] have 5-letter mapcodes more often than 6-letter mapcodes. In fact, a significant number of people lives in the 100 square kilometers of very densely populated city centers of [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Eindhoven]] en [[Utrecht]], which are covered by 4-letter codes. The mapcode system thus defines a population-density-based code division for all (roughly 200) countries on Earth, all (roughly 100) overseas territories, and roughly 240 subdivisions (provinces, states, oblasts etc.). With the exception of Antarctica and the international waters, few localities on the surface of the Earth require a mapcode longer than 7 letters.

Note that mapcodes can in fact be made arbitrarily precise: at the cost of two extra characters, a mapcode is guaranteed to be less than 25 centimeters from the original coordinate. Every character added increases the accuracy further by a factor of 30. 
Hoewever, the mapcode documentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapcode reference document|url=http://www.mapcode.com/mapcode_documentation.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that this defeats the key purpose of the mapcode system: to offer the simplest possible codes appropriate for public, every-day use.

==History==

The mapcode system (not to be confused with the [[Denso mapcode]] system, a different [[spatial reference system]]) was developed in 2001 by [[TomTom]]'s [[Pieter Geelen]] and [[Harold Goddijn]],&lt;ref name="tele_DidT" /&gt; soon after the GPS satellite signals were opened up for civilian use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The end of GPS Selective Availability|url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/sa/goldin/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided to donate the mapcode system to the public domain in 2008. The algorithms and data tables are maintained by the Mapcode Foundation, which provides source code and specifications free of charge to any organization that wants to support mapcodes. The mapcode system is the subject of a [http://www.google.com/patents/WO2013057221A1?cl=en patent application] and a standard filed at the [[International Organization for Standardization]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The term "mapcode" was also used by [[Denso mapcode|Denso]] in Japan. The international mapcode system operated by the Mapcode Foundation is in no way linked to Denso or based on the [[Denso mapcode|Denso system]].

{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
In [[geology]], a '''massif''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|m|æ|ˈ|s|iː|f}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|s|ɪ|f}}) is a section of a planet's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] that is demarcated by [[geologic fault|fault]]s or [[Lithospheric flexure|flexure]]s. In the [[Plate tectonics|movement of the crust]], a massif tends to retain its internal structure while being displaced as a whole. The term also refers to a group of [[mountain]]s formed by such a structure.

In [[mountaineering]] and [[climbing]] literature, a massif is frequently used to denote the main mass of an individual mountain. The massif is a smaller structural unit of the crust than a [[tectonic plate]] and is considered the fourth largest driving force in [[geomorphology]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 2008, Time scales of tectonic landscapes and their sediment routing systems, Geol. Soc. Lon. Sp. Pub., v. 296, p. 7–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is taken from [[French language|French]] (in which the word also means "massive"), where it is used to refer to a large mountain mass or compact group of connected mountains forming an independent portion of a range. One of the most notable [[Europe]]an examples of a massif is the [[Massif Central]] of the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] region of [[France]].

The [[Cydonia (region of Mars)|Face on Mars]] is an example of an extraterrestrial massif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060921_mars_images.html|title=Mars Face Makeover: Controversial Formation Observed from New Angles |last=Britt|first=Robert Roy|date=2006-09-21|publisher=[[Space.com]]|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Massifs may also form underwater, as with the [[Atlantis Massif]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2002MarGR..23..443B|last=Blackman|first=Donna|year=2002|title=Geology of the Atlantis Massif (Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 30°N): Implications for the evolution of an ultramafic oceanic core complex|journal=Marine Geophysical Researches|volume=23|issue=5|pages=443–469|doi=10.1023/b:mari.0000018232.14085.75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Names of Jerusalem''' refers to the multiple names by which the city of [[Jerusalem]] has been known and the etymology of the word in different languages. According to the [[Jewish]] [[Midrash]], "Jerusalem has 70 names".&lt;ref&gt;[[Numbers Rabbah]], 14, 12; Midrash Tadsha ([[Baraita]] [[Phinehas ben Jair]] 10; Midrash Zuta [[Song of Songs]] 3,1; [[Midrash ha-Gadol]] [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 46, 8;&lt;/ref&gt; Lists have been compiled of 72 different [[Hebrew]] names for Jerusalem in [[Jewish scripture]].&lt;ref&gt;Ilana Caznelvugen lists the 72 names in her two articles "Many names for Jerusalem" and "70 Names for Jerusalem", Sinai 116, Mosad Harav Kook, 1995.  The [[Jerusalem municipality]] website [http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_sys/publish/HtmlFiles/1127/results_pub_id=5176.html lists 105 Hebrew names].&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Jerusalem is called '''''Yerushalayim''''' ({{lang-he|יְרוּשָׁלַיִם}}) and '''''Al-Quds''''' ({{lang-ar|اَلْـقُـدْس}}). ''Yerushalayim'' is a derivation of a much older name, recorded as early as in the [[Middle Bronze Age]], which has however been repeatedly re-interpreted in [[folk etymology]], notably in [[Biblical Greek]], where the first element of the name came to be associated with {{lang-el|ἱερός}} (''hieros'', "holy"). The city is also known especially among religious-minded Muslims as '''''Bayt al-Maqdis''''' ({{lang-ar|بَـيْـت الْـمَـقْـدِس}}).

Nadav Naʼaman, ''Canaan in the 2nd Millennium B.C.E.,'' Eisenbrauns, 2005 p.&amp;nbsp;177ff., offers a dissenting opinion, arguing for the transcription ''Rôsh-ramen'', etymologised to ''r'š'' (head) and ''rmm'' (be exalted), to mean 'the exalted Head', and not referring to Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G.

The Sumero-Akkadian name for Jerusalem, ''uru-salim'',&lt;ref&gt;See [[Victor P.

Hamilton also asserts that Sumerian ''uru'' is ''y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;rû'', meaning "city."&lt;/ref&gt; is variously etymologised to mean "foundation of [or: by] the god [[Shalim]]": from Hebrew/Semitic ''yry,'' ‘to found, to lay a cornerstone’, and Shalim, the Canaanite god of the setting sun and the nether world, as well as of health and perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Meir Ben-Dov, ''Historical Atlas of Jerusalem,'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephen J.

Shalem is known from an Ugaritic mythological text as the god of twilight.").&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jerusalem'' is the name most commonly used in the [[Bible]], and the name used by most of the [[Western World]].   The [[Biblical Hebrew]] form is '''Yerushalaim''' ({{Hebrew|ירושלם}}), adopted in  [[Biblical Greek]] as '''Hierousalēm''', ''Ierousalēm'' ({{lang|grc|Ιερουσαλήμ}}), or '''Hierosolyma''', ''Ierosolyma'' ({{lang|grc|Ιεροσόλυμα}}), and in early [[Christian Bible]]s as [[Syriac language|Syriac]] '''Ūrišlem''' ({{lang|syc|ܐܘܪܫܠܡ}}) as well as [[Latin]] '''{{lang|la|Hierosolyma}}''' or '''{{lang|la|Ierusalem}}'''. In Arabic this name occurs in the form '''Ūrsālim''' ({{lang|ar|أْوْرْسَـالِـم}}).

The name "Shalem", whether as a town or a deity, is derived from the same root as the word "[[shalom]]", meaning peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Jerusalem |last=Elon |first=Amos |url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/tucker/hh362/telavivandjerusalem.htm |isbn=0-00-637531-6 |accessdate=26 April 2007 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd|quote=The epithet may have originated in the ancient name of Jerusalem—Salem (after the pagan deity of the city), which is etymologically connected in the Semitic languages with the words for peace (shalom in Hebrew, salam in Arabic).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren, H., ''Die Religionen des Alten Orients'' (Göttingen, 1979), 212.&lt;/ref&gt; so that the common interpretation of the name is now "The City of Peace"&lt;ref name="Stephen J.

The ending ''-ayim'' indicates the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] in Hebrew, thus leading to the suggestion that the name refers to the two hills on which the city sits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0-405-10298-4|last=Wallace|first=Edwin Sherman|title=Jerusalem the Holy|date=August 1977|page=16|quote=A similar view was held by those who give the Hebrew dual to the word|publisher=Arno Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jerusalem: The Topography, Economics and History from the Earliest Times to A.D. 70|last=Smith|first=George Adam|year=1907|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|page=251|quote=The termination -aim or -ayim used to be taken as the ordinary termination of the dual of nouns, and was explained as signifying the upper and lower cities.|isbn=0-7905-2935-1}} (see [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nf4QAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=jerusalem+name+dual&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1 here])&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pronunciation of the last syllable as ''-ayim'' appears to be a late development, which had not yet appeared at the time of the [[Septuagint]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} In fact, in the unvocalized [[Masoretic Text]] of the Hebrew Bible the ''[[Palatal approximant|yod]]'' that would be required for the ''-ayim'' ending (so that it would be written {{Hebrew|ירושלים}}, as in post-biblical Hebrew, rather than {{Hebrew|ירושלם}}) is almost always absent. It is only the much later [[Niqqud|vocalization]], with the vowel marks for ''a'' and ''i'' squeezed together between the [[lamed]] and the [[mem]], that provides the basis for this reading.

In [[Genesis Rabbah]] 56:10, the name is interpreted as a combination of ''yir'eh'', "He will see [to it]," and ''[[Salem (Bible)|Shalem]]'', the city of King Melchizedek (based on Genesis 14:18). A similar theory is offered by [[Philo]] in his discussion of the term "God's city." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=JD-0SEV3Sd8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=jerusalem+yeru+shalem+abode+of+peace&amp;ots=unnxzWARNU&amp;sig=xkxShqf6enLz3n1lroXTzQ16Q8Q&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false With Letters of Light: Studies in the Dead Sea Scrolls, Early Jewish Apocalypticism, Magic and Mysticism, eds. Daphna Arbel and Andrei Orlov]&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[midrash]]im say that Jerusalem means "City of Peace".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/bechuko/klein.htm Bar Ilan University, Prof. Yaakov Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek, the city is called either ''Ierousalēm'' (Ἰερουσαλήμ) or ''Hierosolyma'' (Ἱεροσόλυμα). The latter exhibits yet another re-etymologization, by association with the word ''hieros'' ({{lang-el|ἱερός}}, "holy").&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hopkins McDannald (editor), ''The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 16'', Americana Corporation, 1947, entry ''Jerusalem''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Kittel (editor), Gerhard Friedrich (editor), Geoffrey W. Bromiley (editor),''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume'', Eerdmans, 1985, entry ''Sion [Zion], Ierousalem [Jerusalem], Hierosolyma [Jerusalem], Hierosolymites [inhabitants of Jerusalem]''&lt;/ref&gt; 
Similarly the Old Norse form '''Jorsala''' exhibits a re-interpretation of the second element as ''-sala'', denoting a hall or temple, common in Old Norse toponyms.

===Shalem===
That the name Salem refers to Jerusalem is evidenced by Psalm 76:2 which uses "Salem" (שלם ''šālêm'') as a parallel for "[[Zion]]", the citadel of Jerusalem. The same identification is made by [[Josephus]] and the [[Peshitta|Aramaic translations of the Bible]].

Shalem was the Canaanite god of dusk, sunset, and the end of the day, also spelled Shalim.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shalim|Shalem]]; [[Shalim]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars believe that his name is preserved in the name of the city Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., L. Grabbe, "Ethnic groups in Jerusalem", in ''Jerusalem in Ancient History and Tradition'' (Clark International, 2003) pp. 145-163; John Day, ''Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan'', Sheffield Academic Press 2002, p. 180; see also [[Shalim]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by some scholars that the name of Jerusalem comes from Uru + Shalem, meaning the foundation of Shalem or founded by Shalem or city of Shalem, and that Shalem was the city god of the place before El Elyon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biu.ac.il/JS/rennert/history_2.html Yisrael Shalem], "Jerusalem: Life Throughout the Ages in a Holy City", Ingeborg Rennert Center for Jerusalem Studies, Bar-Ilan University (2012).

===Zion===
{{main|Zion}}
[[Mount Zion]] ({{lang-he-n|הר צִיּוֹן}} ''Har Tsiyyon'') was originally the name of the hill where the Jebusite fortress stood, but the name was later applied to the [[Temple Mount]] just to the north of the fortress (also known as Mount [[Moriah]], possibly also referred to as "Daughter of Zion" (i.e., as a protrusion of Mount Zion proper) originally).

Still later ([[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple era]]), the name came to be applied to a hill just to the south-west of the walled city. This latter hill is still known as Mount Zion today. From the point of view of the [[Babylonian exile]] (6th century BCE), ''Zion'' has come to be used as a synonym of the city of Jerusalem as a whole.

===Other biblical names===
*Mount Moriah (now the Temple mount) was a part of Yevus (Jebus, see Judges 19:10) city inhabited by the Jebusites. According to the Bible, this land was sold to King David by Ornan (the Jebusite) for the full price of purchase (six hundred shekels of Gold). 1Chr 21:26 in order to build an altar in the threshing floor for sacrifice, in staying the plague God had visited upon Israel. Solomon later built the Temple there. The Jebusite stronghold at that time was called Zion which David took by force, and it afterward began to be called The City of David.  2Sam 5:7-10

According to "[[Shahnameh]]", ancient Iranian used "Kang Diz Huxt" '''کَـنْـگ دِژ هُـوْخْـت''' or "Diz Kang Huxt" '''دِژ کَـنْـگ هُـوْخْـت''' to name Jerusalem . "Kang Diz Huxt" means "holy palace" and was the capital of "Zahhak" and also "[[Fereydun|Fereydun's]]" kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://jls.um.ac.ir/index.php/literary/article/view/44857&lt;/ref&gt;

It means "[the] accursed Kang".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lurje|first1=Pavel|title=KANGDEZ|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kangdez-fortress-of-kang|publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica|accessdate=15 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Roman==
[[Aelia Capitolina]] was the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] name given to Jerusalem in the 2nd century, after the [[destruction of the Second Temple]]. The name refers to Hadrian's family, the ''[[gens]] [[Aelia (gens)|Aelia]]'', and to the hill temple of Jupiter built on the remains of the Temple.
During the later Roman Era, the city was expanded to the area now known as the [[Old City of Jerusalem]]. Population increased during this period, peaking at several hundred thousand, numbers only reached again [[Demographic history of Jerusalem|in the modern city]], in the 1960s.

From this name derive [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|إِيْـلْـيَـاء|rtl=yes}} ''ʼĪlyāʼ'', [[Tiberian Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|אֵילִיָּה קַפִּיטוֹלִינָה}} ''ʼÊliyyāh Qappîṭôlînāh'', [[Standard Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|אֵילִיָּה קַפִּיטוֹלִינָה}} ''Eliyya Qappitolina''.
The Roman name was loaned into Arabic as '''ʼĪlyāʼ''', early in the Middle Ages, and appears in some [[Hadith]] ([[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] 1:6, 4:191; [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]] 20:26), like Bayt ul-Maqdis.

==Islamic==
Jerusalem fell to the [[Islamization of Palestine|Muslim conquest of Palestine]] in 638.
The [[History of Jerusalem (Middle Ages)|medieval city]] corresponded to what is now known as the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] (expanded in the 2nd century as Roman ''[[Aelia Capitolina]]''). Population at the time of the Muslim conquest was about 200,000, but from about the 10th century it declined, to less than half that number by the time of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Christian conquest]] in the 11th century, and with the re-conquest by the [[Khwarezmi Turks]] was further decimated to about 2,000 people (moderately recovering to some 8,000 under Ottoman rule by the [[Expansion of Jerusalem in the 19th-century|19th century]]).

The modern [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name of Jerusalem is '''اَلْـقُـدْس''' '''al-Quds''', and its first recorded use can be traced to the 9th century CE, two hundred years after the Muslim conquest of the city. Prior to the use of this name, the names used for Jerusalem were '''إِيْـلْـيَـاء''' '''Iliya''' (from the Latin name '''Aelia''') and '''بَـيْـت الْـمَـقْـدِس''' ('''Bayt al-Maqdis''') or '''بَـيْـت الْـمُـقَـدَّس''' ('''Bayt al-Muqaddas''').&lt;ref name="El-Awaisi 2011"&gt;El-Awaisi, Khalid.

'''[[Al-Quds]]''' is the most common Arabic name for Jerusalem and is used by many cultures influenced by [[Islam]]. The name may have been a direct translation of the Hebrew nickname for the city, "Ir ''HaKodesh''" (עיר הקודש "The Holy City" or "City of the Holiness"). The variant '''اَلْـقُـدْس الـشَّـرِيْـف''' '''al-Quds aš-Šarīf''' ("Al-Quds the Noble") has also been used, notably by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], who also used the Persian influenced '''Kuds-i Şerîf'''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}*

'''Bayt al-Maqdis''' or '''Bayt al-Muqaddas''' is a less commonly used Arabic name for Jerusalem though it appeared more commonly in early Islamic sources. It is the base from which [[nisba (onomastics)|nisbas]] (names based on the origin of the person named) are formed - hence the famous medieval geographer called both [[Al-Muqaddasi|al-Maqdisi]] and [[al-Muqaddasi]] (born 946.) This name is of a [[semantic]] extension from the [[Hadith]]s used in reference to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], called ''Beit HaMikdash'' (בית המקדש "The Holy Temple" or "Temple of the Sanctified Place") in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Carrol, James.

'''Nkosi's Haven''' is an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] in the [[Johannesburg, South Africa]] area that offers residential, holistic care and support for mothers and their children whose lives have been impacted by [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nkosi's Haven|title=About|url=http://nkosishaven.org/who-we-are/|publisher=Nkosi's Haven|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nkosi's Haven also provides support for [[orphan]]s, HIV/AIDS affected or not.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; It aims to improve the productivity of their residents through providing access to medical care, therapy, education and skill building workshops.

Nkosi's Haven was named after Nkosi Johnson, a young AIDS activist who died on International [[Children's Day|Children's Day]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nkosi's Haven|title=Nkosi Johnson's History|url=http://nkosishaven.org/nkosi-johnsons-history/|website=Nkosi's Haven|publisher=Nkosi's Haven|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born Xolani Nkosi, Nkosi was infected with HIV through [[mother-to-child transmission]]. Nkosi and his mother were admitted to an AIDS care centre in Johannesburg, where they met Gail Johnson, a volunteer worker.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Due to financial restraints, the care centre that Nkosi and his mother were living in closed down. Nkosi's mother's health was deteriorating rapidly and she was unable to keep Nkosi due to her health conditions and financial dependency. She also feared that the community would find out that both herself and Nkosi were HIV positive and exile them.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beresford|first1=Belinda|title=Nkosi Johnson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jun/02/guardianobituaries.aids|accessdate=5 December 2016|issue=Special report: Aids|publisher=The Guardian News and Media Limited|date=2 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Gail Johnson took Nkosi into her care, changing his name to Nkosi Johnson, and became his legal foster mother.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Gail Johnson attempted to enroll Nkosi into school in Johannesburg and was faced with backlash as soon as Nkosi's HIV status was made public.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; In 1997, Johnson took the case to court, winning her case and forcing the South African educational system to revise their admittance policies discriminating against children with AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/gail-johnson|title=Gail Johnson|last=South African History Online|first=|date=16 August 2016|website=www.sahistory.org.za|publisher=South African History Online|access-date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nkosi's experience with discrimination due to his health status and the forced separation between him and his mother, Nkosi's dream was to create an HIV/AIDS care centre in which children and their mothers could live freely without prejudice or discrimination because of their health status. With the help of his foster mother, Gail, Nkosi opened Nkosi's Haven in 1999, providing hundreds of mothers and their children with a safe space and communal environment.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Nkosi's journey made him the national figure in the fight against AIDS.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; In July 2000, Nkosi wrote and presented a speech at the [[XIII International AIDS Conference, 2000|13th International Aids Conference]], held in [[Durban]], which was televised worldwide.&lt;ref name="Thom Anso"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thom|first1=Anso|title=Nkosi Johnson, you were the Hector Pieterson of the Aids generation|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-07-10-nkosi-johnson-you-were-the-hector-pieterson-of-the-aids-generation/#.WDInK2QrK00|accessdate=20 November 2016|publisher=Daily Maverick|date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 11 years old, he spoke to delegates about his experience growing up with HIV. His fight with HIV birthed his dream to raise awareness and erase the stigma of HIV/AIDS through communal, supportive environments and care centres.&lt;ref name="Thom Anso" /&gt; Nkosi is most famously known for his quote,
“We are normal. We have hands. We have feet. We can walk, we can talk, we have needs just like everyone else- don't be afraid of us- we are all the same!"&lt;ref name="Thom Anso" /&gt;

A year before his death, Nkosi suffered through severe brain damage and viral infections due to AIDS. He was bedridden, emaciated, suffering from seizures and unable to eat solid foods. After battling the disease for 12 years, Nkosi Johnson died in his sleep on 1 June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loof|first1=Susanna|title=Young AIDS Activist Dies|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=81001&amp;page=1|accessdate=6 December 2016|agency=ABC News|publisher=ABC News|date=1 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkosi was given a hero's burial memorial service in Johannesburg with thousands of attendees paying their respects to the late activist.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

At the time of his death, Nkosi Johnson was South Africa's longest surviving child born with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=28 July 2014|title=The critical condition of rhetorical choices The Bush administration's framing of HIV/AIDS as a national security threat in PEPFAR|journal=The Journal of International Communication|volume=21|issue=2|pages=226–240|last1=Yartey|first1=Franklin Nii Amankwah}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he was awarded with the International Children's Peace Prize for his fight against HIV/AIDS and activist efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/nkosi-johnson|title=Nkosi Johnson|website=South African History Online|publisher=South African History Online|last1=South African History Online|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his death, [[Nelson Mandela]] released a statement, recognizing Nkosi as an "icon of the struggle for life" who fought fearlessly against HIV/AIDS. He urged everyone to give their support during this time, acknowledging Nkosi as an ambassador for South Africa and its people, especially those living with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mandela|first1=Nelson|title=Message By Nelson Mandela about Nkosi Johnson|url=http://www.mandela.gov.za/mandela_speeches/2001/0106_nkosi.htm|website=www.mandela.gov.za|publisher=Nelson Mandela Foundation|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkosi Johnson's legacy lives on through the work of Nkosi's Haven.

== HIV/AIDS in South Africa ==
[[South Africa]] has had high rates of [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|HIV/AIDS]] diagnoses for years, with approximately 6.19 million accounted individuals living with HIV/AIDS in 2015.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Statistics South Africa|title=Mid-year population estimates 2015|url=https://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0302/P03022015.pdf|website=Statistics South Africa|publisher=Statistics South Africa|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the age group of adults aged 15–49 years old, 16.6% of that cohort is HIV positive. HIV/AIDS related deaths have been declining as of recent years, with 2005 being the year with the highest number of deaths in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt; Thereafter, [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretroviral treatment]] was administered and easily accessible, changing the patterns of HIV/AIDS and extending the lifespan of many South Africans who would have otherwise died at an earlier age.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt;

HIV/AIDS related illnesses are still high, with an increase of 4.02 million people living with HIV in South Africa from 2002 to 2015. Statistics South Africa approximates that every one out of five South African females in their reproductive ages are living with HIV.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt;

UNAIDS reports that approximately 2.1 million children in South Africa are orphans due to HIV/AIDS related illnesses, with 180,000 deaths occurring in the year of 2015. Women over the age of 15 account for 4 million people living with HIV, and approximately 240,000 children under the age of 14 have been affected by HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNAIDS|title=HIV and AIDS estimates (2015)|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/southafrica|website=www.unaids.org|publisher=UNAIDS|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence has shown that the HIV/AIDS crisis has had a significant impact on South African family life. Responsibility for children growing up in South African society has been increasingly separate from biological parenthood due to the lack of parental care available.&lt;ref name="Law of SA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=van der Merwe|first1=C.G|last2=du Plessis|first2=Jacques E.|title=Introduction to the Law of South Africa|date=2004|publisher=Luwer Law International|location=The Netherlands|isbn=9041122826|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under many circumstances, children often  care for their own families due to the circumstances created by the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS epidemic]].&lt;ref name="Law of SA" /&gt;

== Nkosi's Haven history ==

=== Berea ===
In 1999, Nkosi and Gail opened their first Nkosi's Haven location in Berea, Johannesburg. Despite being close to the city centre, selling properties became increasingly difficult in Berea, with the neighbouring area of [[Hillbrow, Johannesburg|Hillbrow]] beside, as it became an area that was frequented with street children and the unemployed.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox|first1=Jane|title=Nkosi's Story|date=15 September 2011|publisher=New Africa Books|location=South Africa|isbn=0864865333}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s was an era of high crime rates in downtown Johannesburg, which neighboured Hillbrow and Berea. After the apartheid ended in the 1990s, many gangs, along with residents from neighbouring townships, moved into the area making it unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanes|first1=Stephanie|title=Ponte City – a South African landmark – rises again|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2008/0212/p20s01-woaf.html|accessdate=21 December 2016|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=12 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the property was offered to Gail Johnson, rent free for 5 years.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox" /&gt;[[File:Hillbrow Johannesburg 01.jpg|thumb|The intersection of Pretoria Street and Banket Street in Hillbrow, Johannesburg]]

The house was located on 23 Mitchell street and consisted of four bedrooms, one bathroom upstairs and one downstairs, a lounge, a room used as a dormitory, and a courtyard.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox" /&gt; Renovations and repairs were needed, in addition to furniture and basic house necessities. To raise funds for the completion of the house, Gail, a former public relations consultant, held a “kitchen tea” in which a wish list was created and publicized in the media and to those who were potential contributors.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox" /&gt; At the tea, Gail explained the reasons behind the creation of Nkosi's Haven. She explained that Nkosi's Haven was to offer a [[kibbutz]] style of living in which residents would take turns at cooking, cleaning, caring for the children, and helping care for each other as needed.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox" /&gt; Gail also told the guests that they already reached capacity for residence at the house. At the time, the house fit nine mothers and their children with presumed costs starting at R28,000 monthly.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox" /&gt; The results of the kitchen tea were successful and Gail managed to fundraise R45,000 worth of furniture and equipment, free electrical services, along with appliances valued at R30,000 for the nursery and dormitory.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox" /&gt;

After 3 years in operation, Nkosi's Haven saw need for a second home as the Berea residence was rapidly expanding with mothers and children living with HIV/AIDS and orphans. In 2002, a separate plot of land was purchased south of Johannesburg. Upon development, both residences catered to over 160 residents and their children providing meals, medication, education, daily necessities for residents living with or without HIV/AIDS, and care for orphans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Due to financial restraints, in 2012, the NGO sold its property in Berea and moved all occupants to Nkosi's Haven Village in Alan Manor, South of Johannesburg.&lt;ref name="Theresa Taylor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Theresa|title=Nkosi’s Haven to move from Berea|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/nkosis-haven-to-move-from-berea-1310700|website=www.iol.co.za/|publisher=The Star|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costs for operating the Berea house were as much as R150,000 to R180,000 monthly, and because all occupants could be accommodated at the village, consolidating all residents meant that no one was left without a home or unemployed. Given that Nkosi's Haven village had bigger plans in motion, the shift would focus on different things such as training opportunities for residents at the newly purchased farm and other facilities at the Nkosi's Haven Village.&lt;ref name="Theresa Taylor" /&gt; These opportunities were unavailable in Berea due to space and financial constraints. Gail reasoned this by stating, “We are not the Titanic. We are consolidating... it makes sense to consolidate and save money.”&lt;ref name="Theresa Taylor" /&gt;

=== Alan Manor ===
[[File:Nkosi's Haven Village.jpg|thumb|Inside Nkosi's Haven Village. Pictured in the background is one of 17 cottages used to house resident mothers, their children, and orphans.]]
Nkosi's Haven grew so rapidly that in 2002, a second 2.5 acre plot of land was purchased in the Alan Manor neighbourhood, south of Johannesburg to begin the development of Nkosi's Haven Village. This was made possible through a grant from the [[Gauteng]] Department of Housing, Social Housing and Special Needs.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nkosi's Haven|title=Nkosi's Haven Village|url=http://nkosishaven.org/what-we-do/nkosis-haven-village/|website=www.nkosishaven.org|publisher=Nkosi's Haven|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the project received backlash from neighbouring communities, key sponsors made the initiative possible and enabled Nkosi's Haven to host up to 180 residents at a time.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;

Nkosi's Haven Village in Alan Manor consists of 17 cottages in which residents reside in, a sickbay, a library, a baby day care, a therapy block, a kitchen, a bakery, and a leisure block. There are also workshops and classrooms such as a computer room and an arts room for additional education and skill building. Administrative offices are located near the sickbay.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt; All residents share household tasks and duties that help with the functioning of the village, providing a sense of leadership and empowerment to residents through skill-building activities.

==== Bakery ====

In 2010, Nkosi's Haven received a bakery donation from the South African Whole Grain Bread Project (SAGWBP). In addition to the onsite bakery container donation, SAGWBP donated enough bread mix for six months.&lt;ref name="Bakery"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nkosi's Haven|title=Unique Container Bakery Turns On the Heat at Nkosi’s Haven Village|url=http://nkosishaven.org/unique-container-bakery-turns-on-the-heat-at-nkosis-haven-village/|website=www.nkosishaven.org|publisher=Nkosi's Haven|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; White and brown loaves are still produced for resident consumption and are marketed to other organizations in the community at a competitive price.&lt;ref name="Bakery" /&gt; The residents of Nkosi's Haven Village handle oversight of operations in the bakery. While providing skill-building opportunities, those who assist can also earn a stipend for their labour.&lt;ref name="Bakery" /&gt;

==== Kitchen ====

In 2009, Nkosi's Haven opened their new, industrial sized kitchen through generous donations from sponsors. Employed resident mothers cook to feed the large number of residents, serving hundreds of meals daily. Three well-balanced meals are provided to every resident mother, all children and volunteers.&lt;ref name="What We Do" /&gt;

==== Leisure Block ====

[[File:Nkosi's Haven Leisure Block.jpg|thumb|A playground onsite at Nkosi's Haven Village in the Leisure Block.]]
A leisure room was built at Nkosi's Haven Village to further meet the requirements to become a Child Care Centre in South Africa. Dance lessons take place in the large space on a weekly basis. The room is painted with bright colours, equipped with colourful furniture, bean bag chairs, a television, and foosball tables.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;
[[File:Nkosi's Haven Leisure Complex.jpg|thumb|One of the areas of Nkosi's Haven Leisure Complex in Johannesburg where residents play sports and host games.]]

==== Library ====

Nkosi's Haven Library provides a space for resident children to do their homework, leisurely reading, art sessions and workshops. Workshops include HIV/AIDS awareness sessions and life skills for women.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt; Through funding, the Haven continues to expand its book collection in hopes to educate and provide relevant resources for residents.

A recent project development was the implementation of [[bibliotherapy]] at the library in 2010. The bibliotherapy program used books to assist the children and young teens with coping with social, emotional and physical issues.&lt;ref name="Tukhareli"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tukhareli|first1=Natalia|title=Bibliotherapy in a Library Setting: Reaching out to Vulnerable Youth|journal=The Canadian Journal of Library and Information Practice and Research|date=2011|volume=6|issue=1|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program identified the children's needs and used a variety of programs to help eradicate the isolation of people living with HIV/AIDS through education, self-awareness, skill development, and recreation.&lt;ref name="Tukhareli" /&gt; Some sessions included storytelling, reading aloud, and "The Wall of Happiness Sessions" in which participants openly discussed what made them happy with the facilitator.&lt;ref name="Tukhareli" /&gt; The program was made available to all residents at Nkosi's Haven, including orphans and those who were free of HIV/AIDS in order to increase overall awareness. Results of the program showed success among residents, with 92% of young participants demonstrating increased knowledge and understanding about HIV/AIDS related issues, 78% demonstrating an increase in comfort and decrease in fear around HIV/AIDS related issues, and 91% of adults demonstrating an improvement in self-esteem and optimistic attitudes.&lt;ref name="Tukhareli" /&gt;

==== Music and Arts ====

A music and arts centre has been built onsite for resident use. This centre includes a keyboard and drums and is also a space that is used by the choir. Due to limited space and resources, Nkosi's Haven relies on the help of volunteers to teach music and arts lessons onsite. Programs are run year-round for mothers and their children.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;

An ongoing workshop is artsINSIDEOUT's annual two-week art camp that runs at Nkosi's Haven. With the help of ASTEP (Artists Striving to End Poverty), a unique art program featuring successful and competitive professionals from all areas of art including students and graduates from [[Juilliard]], ASTEP volunteer artists use storytelling, singing, acting, dancing and visual arts to inspire the youth at Nkosi's Haven to build community, consciousness and self-awareness.&lt;ref name="Artists Striving to End Poverty"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Artists Striving to End Poverty|title=South Africa Program|url=https://www.astep.org/artsinsideout/|website=www.astep.org|publisher=Artists Striving to End Poverty|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, artsINSIDEOUT has organized trips to Nkosi's Haven for 6 years and has provided funding for year-round programming, including workshops and cultural programs. Local artists are invited to join the diverse artsINSIDEOUT team to enhance cultural programs available to Nkosi's Haven.

==== Sickbay ====

In 2006, Nkosi's Haven Village completed the [[Sick bay|Sickbay]], consisting of a 9-bed unit, qualified nursing staff, and family physicians to help care for HIV positive residents. Many residents are sick due to AIDS related illnesses and are being administered quality treatment and ARV's as needed.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;

==== Therapy Block ====

All children at Nkosi's Haven Village receive various forms of therapy, including [[Therapy|remedial]], [[Play therapy|play]], [[Occupational therapy|occupational]] and [[Speech therapy|speech]].&lt;ref name="What We Do" /&gt; The therapy block was completed in December 2009 and employs two full-time therapists onsite to assist residents living with HIV/AIDS. Therapists also assist with helping resident mothers disclose their HIV status to their children.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;

==== Workshops and classrooms ====

Nkosi's Haven Village has one classroom and two workshops that act as a site for homework and afterschool programs. These areas offer skill-building workshops on a regular basis for residents to learn various skills such as knitting, pottery, resume writing, and more.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;

With the help of BT South Africa, an ICT infrastructure company, Nkosi's Haven opened a communications centre in 2010. The room comes equipped with computer monitors valued at R100,000 which allows the youth at Nkosi's Haven to videoconference and chat with their mentors and friends worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=39569|title=BT helps children, mothers of Nkosi's Haven in SA reach for better future|last=BT|first=|date=9 December 2010|website=www.itweb.co.za|publisher=ITWeb Limited|access-date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infinite Family, an American organization that enables children living with HIV/AIDS  to connect with mentors worldwide, has provided more than 50 youth at Nkosi's Haven with mentors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This room is also used to assist resident youth with their homework.

==== Nkosi's Haven 4life Farm ====
Nkosi's Haven 4Life Farm, located 50&amp;nbsp;km south of Johannesburg, has been in operation since 2008. The farm is 12 acres and currently provides crops for meals at Nkosi's Haven Village. Foundation 4Life has helped support Nkosi's Haven for years and made contributions that helped begin the production of the farm.&lt;ref name="Farm"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nkosi's Haven|title=Nkosi's Haven 4Life Farm|url=http://nkosishaven.org/what-we-do/nkosis-4life-farm/|website=www.nkosishaven.org|publisher=Nkosi's Haven|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foundation 4Life|title=4Life Executives Visit Nkosi’s Haven|url=http://www.foundation4life.org/en/news/categories/20|website=www.foundation4life.org/|publisher=4Life Trademarks|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the next 5 years of full operation, Nkosi's Haven 4LIFE farm aims to implement a self-sustaining style of living in which mothers living with HIV/AIDS and their children from a neighbouring township and the surrounding area will assist in growing organic food to serve themselves, Nkosi's Haven's residents, and the local markets and supermarkets. The goal is to produce crops for sale in supermarket chains in South Africa once the farm is sustainable and crops are of good standard. A number of new cottages will be built on the farm to accommodate more mothers and their children in need of Nkosi's Haven's assistance.&lt;ref name="Farm" /&gt;

== Future projects ==

=== Preschool ===
Nkosi's Haven has begun construction on the premises to begin early interventions of child development, skill transfer and various forms of therapy. Given that children in South Africa are held back from attending school if they are undergoing forms of therapy, an onsite preschool bypasses those restrictions and enables youth to develop their skills while receiving therapy. Nkosi's Haven pays R1000 monthly for each toddler to attend preschool outside of Nkosi's Haven, thus, an onsite preschool will save financial resources and assist Nkosi's Haven in becoming self-sufficient and sustainable. Nkosi's Haven plans to hire certified teachers in addition to training resident mothers to assist at the preschool, also building their skills and capacity.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;

'''Northeast Italy''' ({{lang-it|'''Italia nord-orientale'''}} or just {{lang|it|'''Nord-est'''}}) is one of the five official statistical regions of [[Italy]] used by the [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|National Institute of Statistics]] (ISTAT), a [[Italian NUTS level 1 regions|first level NUTS region]] and a [[European Parliament constituency]]. Northeast encompasses four of the [[Regions of Italy|country's 20 regions]]:

*[[Emilia-Romagna]]
*[[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]]
*[[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]]
*[[Veneto]]

Culturally and historically, [[Emilia-Romagna]] is part of [[Northwest Italy]], but is included in Northeast Italy for statistical reasons.

==Culture==
[[Italian language|Italian]] is the main language. Other languages include [[Venetian language|Venetian]], widely spoken in Veneto and along the coast to [[Trieste]] and Istria, as well as in the towns of [[Pordenone]] and [[Gorizia]] in [[Friuli]], and in most of [[Trentino]], but only recognised by the [[Veneto]] region; [[Friulian]], spoken in most of [[Friuli]] and nationally recognized, and [[Ladin language|Ladin]], spoken by a few thousand people in the [[Dolomites]]. Other languages are [[German language|German]], the primary language of [[South Tyrol]], where Italian is spoken by about two thirds of the inhabitants, and [[Slovene language|Slovene]], recognized by Italy and spoken on the border of Italy and Istria, where the main language today is [[Croatia]]n but Italian is recognized as a minority language.

The terms '''''[[Tre Venezie]]''''' or '''''[[Triveneto]]''' ''(literally "Triple Veneto"), refer to the three regions of  Veneto (before 1947 Venezia Euganea, united to Friuli) [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]] (once Venezia Tridentina) and Friuli-Venezia Giulia.

'''''[[Venetia (region)|Venetia]]''''', a region which indicated the old land provinces of [[Republic of Venice|the Venetian Republic]] from river [[Adda (river)|Adda]] to river [[Isonzo]], and is sometimes still used today to indicate this territory together with [[Trentino]] and Trieste.

'''''[[Venetia et Histria]]''''', an old region of [[Italy]] at the time of [[Roman Empire]], refers to Veneto, [[Trentino]], Friuli-Venezia Giulia, East [[Lombardy]] and Istria; it was named after the people of [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]], who inhabited that region, and who are still largely the main ethnic group of the Italian area (other main ethnic groups include [[Friulani]] in the east, mostly in [[Province of Udine|Udine province]]; [[Ladin people|Ladins]] in the [[Dolomites]] are between Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol; [[Germans]] in [[South Tyrol]]; and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] minorities on the border with [[Slovenia]] and in the city of Trieste); while after 1947 Venetian/[[Italian people]] are just a minority in Slovenian and [[Croatia]]n Istria.

In 1899, the Brazilian states of [[Pará]] and [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] hired Coudreau to explore and chart the [[Amazon region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jFY3CxmHk4cC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167|title=Chronology of Women's History|author=Kirstin Olsen|isbn=978-0313288036|year=1994|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband was the French explorer and geographer [[Henri Coudreau]].

==Exploration of the Amazon==
At the time of the ''contesté franco-brésilien'' boundary dispute between  [[French colonial empire#The Americas|colonial France]] and Brazil, Coudreau's husband Henri  worked in the service of governors of the states of Brazil, mapping the Amazon's [[tributaries]] and identifying possible resources for farmers and foresters. On behalf of the State of Pará, Henri Coudreau was charged with exploring the [[Trombetas]] River, shortly after Octavie married him.

[[File:Cachoeira Curua 2.jpg|thumbnail|A waterfall on the Rio Curua, in Brazil.  Coudreau wrote of her expedition on the river in ''Voyage Au Rio Curua (1903).'']]

Their first expedition in 1899 ended tragically, as detailed in the book ''Voyage au Trombetas'' begun by Henri Coudreau.  It describes their voyage up the Trombetas tributary of the north bank of the Amazon. He was already sick and exhausted by the years spent in what he called the "green hell". Suffering from [[malaria]]l fever, he died in her arms on 10 November 1899. Aided by his traveling companions, she made a coffin from the planks of the boat and prepared a burial on a promontory overlooking Lake Tapagem.

After Henri Coudreau's death, she continued the exploration work begun by her husband for seven years.&lt;ref name="sudouest"/&gt;  She later wrote the final chapters of the book, following the repatriation of his remains to [[Angoulême]] in France.

{{quote| "If I'm an ''explorateur'' - this word can not bear to be feminine - it is not for the sake of the glory, which is far too fickle a goddess and more blind than Fortune; it is not for love of geography, I think I should greatly love geography when I do not.
If I do exploration, it is to allow me to reunite the remains of my husband with those of his elderly parents; it is that Henri Coudreau should not remain forever in a well-loved foreign land; it is also to complete the work begun five years ago, useful work among all because it consists mainly to publicize the lands still ignored by the masses." (''Voyage au Cumina'', 1900)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henricoudreau.fr/biographies/octavie.html|title=Octavie Coudreau - Une femme dans l’Enfer vert|language=French|publisher=henricoudreau.fr|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1899 to 1906, she worked as an official explorer for the French government, a role not normally open to women at the time. Enduring the same levels of hardship that had eventually killed her husband, she made pioneering contributions to the knowledge of the Amazon tropical area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QmfyK0QtsRAC&amp;pg=PA296|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: Pioneering Lives from Ancient Times to the Mid-20th Century|editor= Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie, Joy Dorothy Harvey|volume=1|page=296|year=1999|isbn=978-0415920407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in [[Sonnac, Charente-Maritime|Sonnac]].&lt;ref name="sudouest"/&gt;

The '''Padina Plateau''' is high-altitude region in the [[Bucegi Mountains]] situated at 1500m above sea level. Among the plateau's attractions is the Bolboci Lake. Also on the plateau is the Padina National Mountain Rescue Centre.&lt;ref name="montania"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montania.ro/en_Sinaia_S.htm|publisher=montania.ro|title=Sinaia summer Hiking routes in Bucegi Mountains, rock climbing, mountain bike in Bucegi|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby is the [[Babele]] area of rock formation and the Omu Peak (2505m), the 11th highest point in Romania.

The '''Panama Plate''' is a small [[tectonic plate]] sandwiched between the [[Cocos Plate]] and [[Nazca Plate]] to the south and the [[Caribbean Plate]] to the north. Most of its borders are [[convergent boundary|convergent boundarie]]s including a [[subduction zone]] to the west. It consists, for the most part, of the nations of [[Panama]] and [[Costa Rica]].

== Municipalities ==

The provinces are in turn divided into municipalities (usually consisting of an individual island) headed by a council and a mayor elected from among the members of the council.

== Island regions (historical) ==
From 1985 to 1994 it was divided into eleven island regions:

'''Sound rangers''' are military specialists who locate enemy artillery using [[sound]]. They use equipment such as super-sensitive [[microphones]] to pick up the sounds of firing. By using a combination of [[surveying]] techniques and [[trigonometry]] they then calculate the locations of enemy [[artillery battery|batteries]]. These results are then transmitted by radio to their own artillery, who used it for targeting.

Sound rangers were used extensively in the [[Second World War]]. Many of the officers were former surveyors, estate agents and geographers because of their surveying experience in civilian life. They would be located near the front line but not always among the firing line for their safety.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7303">The '''Space Situational Awareness''' ('''SSA''') '''Programme''' is the [[European Space Agency]]'s initiative designed to support [[Space policy of the European Union|Europe's independent space access and utilization]] through the timely and accurate information delivery regarding the space environment, and particularly hazards to both in orbit and ground infrastructure.&lt;ref name=ssa-about&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/About_SSA|title=About SSA|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSA programme is split into three main segments:&lt;ref name=ssa-overview&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/SSA_Programme_overview|title=SSA Programme overview|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Space Weather]] (SWE) segment: monitoring the [[Sun]], the [[solar wind]], and in Earth’s [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]] and [[thermosphere]], that can affect spaceborne and ground-based infrastructure or endanger human life or health
* [[Near-Earth Objects]] (NEO) segment: detecting natural objects, such as [[asteroids]] and [[comets]], which can potentially [[Impact event|impact Earth]]
* [[Space surveillance|Space Surveillance and Tracking]] (SST) segment: Tracking active and inactive [[satellite]]s and [[space debris]] (collectively these items are referred to as [[Resident Space Object | Resident Space Objects]] (RSOs)).

The SSA programme is being implemented as an optional ESA programme with financial participation by 14 Member States. The programme started in 2009 and its mandate was extended until 2019. The second phase of the programme received €46.5 million for the 2013-2016 period.&lt;ref name=ssa-overview /&gt;

==Space Weather Segment==
The main objective of the Space Weather Segment (SWE) is to detect and forecast of [[space weather]] events, avoid adverse effect on European space assets and ground-based infrastructure. To achieve that, the segment will focus on delivery of real-time space weather information, forecasts and warnings, supported by a data archive, applications and services. Assets currently available for the segment consist of multiple ground-based and spaceborne sensors monitoring the Sun, [[solar wind]] and Earth's [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]] and [[thermosphere]]. These include the [[PROBA2]] satellite and the [[Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory]]. The segment is jointly coordinated by the SWE Data Centre located at the [[ESTRACK]] [[Redu Station]] and the SSA Space Weather Coordination Centre (SSCC), both in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=swe&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Space_Weather_-_SWE_Segment|title=SWE Segment|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Near-Earth Object Segment==
The [[near-Earth object]] segment aims to deliver monitoring and warning of potential [[Impact event|Earth impactors]] and tracking of newly discovered objects. The segment's current assets consist of a mixture of professional and amateur telescopes, including the [[OGS Telescope]], that are supported by tracking databases. The plans are to create a fully integrated system supporting alerts for civil authorities. The segment is operated by the SSA NEO Coordination Centre located at the [[ESA Centre for Earth Observation]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=neo&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Near-Earth_Objects_-_NEO_Segment |title=NEO Segment| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space Surveillance and Tracking Segment==
The SST segment's primary goal is the detection, cataloguing and orbit prediction of objects orbiting the Earth. It is part of an effort to avoid collisions between orbiting satellites and debris, provide safe reentries, detect on-orbit explosions, assist missions at launch, deployment and end-of-life and overall reduce cost of space access. The segment currently relies on existing European radar and optical systems. Some of its assets are existing [[radio telescope|radio]] and [[optical telescopes]], with now serving a secondary role for tracking space debris.&lt;ref name=sst&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Space_Surveillance_and_Tracking_-_SST_Segment| title=SST Segment| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radar-based SST assets are split into two categories: surveillance and tracking systems. SSA SST radar systems include:&lt;ref name=sst-radars&gt;{{cite web|url = https://sst.ssa.esa.int/cwbi/general/radar_sens.xhtml| title=Europe’s Radar Space Surveillance and Tracking Sensors| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** [[OGS Telescope]] at the [[Teide Observatory]]
** [[TAROT-South robotic observatory|TAROT and TAROT-South]] robotic telescope at the [[La Silla Observatory]]
** ZIMLAT telescope at the [[Zimmerwald Observatory]]

As part of the SSA Programme new, dedicated surveillance radar supported by optical sensors systems will be developed. The segment is coordinated by the Space Surveillance Test &amp; Validation (SSTC) Centre located at the [[European Space Astronomy Centre|ESAC]] in [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=sst /&gt;

The '''Johore Strait''' (also known as the '''Tebrau Strait''', '''Straits of Johor,'''  '''Selat Johor''', '''Selat Tebrau''', and '''Tebrau Reach''') is an international [[strait]] in [[Southeast Asia]], between [[Singapore]] and [[Peninsular Malaysia]].

==Geography==
The strait separates the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Johor]] on the mainland [[Malay Peninsula]] to the north, from [[Singapore]] and its islands on the south. It connects to the [[Strait of Malacca]] on the west, and the [[Singapore Strait]] on the southeast.

The mouth and delta of the [[Johor River]] is on its northeast side in Malaysia.

===Crossings===
There are currently two bridges crossing the strait. The [[Johor–Singapore Causeway]], known simply as "The Causeway", links [[Johor Bahru]] and [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] in Singapore. The [[Malaysia–Singapore Second Link]] bridge is further west over the strait, links [[Iskandar Puteri]] in Malaysia and [[Tuas]] in Singapore.

In 2003, Malaysia wanted to build a bridge across the strait to replace the existing causeway, but negotiations with Singapore were not successful. The main reasons cited for the change were:
# a bridge would allow free flow of water across both sides of the strait which were artificially cut in two with the building of the causeway before (this would allow ships to bypass the port of Singapore).
# a bridge would help ease congestion in [[Johor Bahru]].

In August 2003, Malaysia announced that it was going ahead with a plan to build a gently sloping, curved bridge that would join up with Singapore's half of the existing causeway. The plans included a swing bridge for the railway line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/030217st.htm Singapore objected to bridge to replace Causeway]&lt;/ref&gt; However, plans to build the bridge have been called off as of 2006.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Tributaries===
Major tributaries which empty into the Strait of Johore include:
{{colbegin|colwidth=25em}}
* [[Johor River]]
* [[Pelentong River, Johor|Pelentong River]]
* [[Pulai River]]
* [[Segget River]]
* [[Tebrau River]]
* Sungai Sengkuang
* Sungai Haji Rahmat
* Sungai Kempas
* Sungai Sri Buntan
* Sungai Abd Samad
* Sungai Air Molek
* Sungai Stulang
* Sungai Setanggong
* Sungai Tampoi
* Sungai Sebulong
* Sungai Bala
* Sungai Pandan
* Sungai Tengkorak
* Sungai Senibong
{{colend|colwidth=25em}}

In the [[Malay language]], ''Sungai'' is the word for river.

==Ecology==
Pollution along the Johore Strait is notable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clean-up of Johor Straits to begin in September|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20080616-71067.html|accessdate=18 February 2016|publisher=AsiaOne|date=16 Jun 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is also a source of environmental contention between Malaysia and Singapore, due to [[land reclamation]] projects on both sides of the Causeway. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chong|first1=Zi Liang|title=Singapore concerned over Johor Strait projects|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/singapore-concerned-over-johor-strait-projects|accessdate=18 February 2016|publisher=AsiaOne}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been suggestions that the ongoing land reclamation projects may impact the [[maritime boundary]], shipping lanes, and water ecology of the Malaysian side.  Environmental Impact Assessments are requested before any reclamation is carried out such as the Forest City project.&lt;ref name="MEWR18022016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Releases|url=http://www.mewr.gov.sg/news/reply-by-ministry-of-the-environment-and-water-resources-to-media-queries-on-singapores-approach-towards-potential-environmental-impact-of-projects-involving-land-reclamation-in-the-straits-of-johor|publisher=MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND WATER RESOURCES|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclamation projects may also endanger the habitat and food source of [[dugong]]s, which are native to the strait.

== History ==
The Johore Strait is the location of two [[Victoria Cross]] deeds. The award was for [[Lieutenant]] [[Ian Edward Fraser]] and Acting [[Leading Seaman]] [[James Joseph Magennis]] for the sinking of the 9,850-tonne [[Japanese cruiser Takao (1930)|Japanese cruiser ''Takao'']] on 31 July.


== Places of interest ==
A well known tourist attraction of the Strait of Johore's is Lido Beach, located on the Malaysian side in [[Johor Bahru]]. &lt;ref name="LidoReclaimation"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reclaimed land in JB caves in|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20101114-247120.html|accessdate=18 February 2016|publisher=The Star|date=14 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lido"&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysian workers use risky shortcut to evade Causeway jam|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/malaysian-workers-use-risky-shortcut-evade-causeway-jam|accessdate=18 February 2016|publisher=Sin Chew Daily|date=21 Jun 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, visitors can walk or cycle along the 2&amp;nbsp;km stretch of the beach. There are numerous restaurants and food stalls.

'''Sustainability''' is the process of maintaining change in a [[Homeostasis|balanced]] fashion, in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalfootprints.org/sustainability|title=What is sustainability|website=www.globalfootprints.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many in the field, sustainability is defined through the following interconnected domains or pillars: environment, economic and social.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/sustainability_primer_v9.pdf|title=Sustainability Primer|last=EPA|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-domains of sustainable development have been considered also: cultural, technological and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice| url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719 | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}; {{Cite journal | year=2013 |author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=Jaes A.

==Etymology==
{{See also|Sustainable development}}

The name sustainability is derived from the [[Latin]] ''sustinere'' (''tenere'', to hold; ''sub'', under). ''Sustain'' can mean "maintain", "support", or "endure".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|sustain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Onions, Charles, T. (ed) (1964). ''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. p. 2095.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s ''sustainability'' has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet Earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept ''[[sustainable development]]'', that of the [[Brundtland Commission]] of the [[United Nations]] on March 20, 1987: "sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly (1987) [http://www.un-documents.net/wced-ocf.htm ''Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future''].

While the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]] identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including economic development, [[social sustainability|social development]] and environmental protection it continued using three domains: economics, environment and social sustainability. More recently, using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade, the [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach distinguished four domains of economic, ecological, political and [[cultural sustainability]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2016 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2=

 | publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; this in accord with the [[United Nations]], [[Unesco]], [[Agenda 21]], and in particular the [[Agenda 21 for culture]] which specifies '''culture''' as the '''fourth''' domain of sustainable development.&lt;ref name="agenda21culture.net"&gt;United Cites and Local Governments, [http://agenda21culture.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=131:cultural-policies-and-sustainable-development-&amp;catid=64&amp;Itemid=58&amp;lang=en "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development"].&lt;/ref&gt; The model is now being used by organizations such as the [[United Nations Global Compact|United Nations]] Cities Programme&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130508005017/http://citiesprogramme.com/aboutus/our-approach/circles-of-sustainability Circles of Sustainability]. citiesprogramme.com&lt;/ref&gt; and Metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolis.org/ World Association of the Major Metropolises], Metropolis. Retrieved on 2016-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Metropolis, this approach does not mean adding a fourth domain of culture to the dominant [[triple bottom line]] figure of the economy, environment and the social. Rather, it involves treating all four domains—economy, ecology, politics and culture—as social (including economics) and distinguishing between ecology (as the intersection of the human and natural worlds) and environment as that which goes far beyond what we as humans can ever know.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metropolis.org/library Metropolis Action Plan 2018-2020, at www.metropolis.org] {{Cite book | year= 2016 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2=

===Seven modalities===
Another model suggests humans attempt to achieve all of their needs and aspirations via seven modalities: economy, community, occupational groups, government, environment, culture, and physiology.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Steve A. (2016). The Nature of Sustainability. Chapbook Press. Grand Rapids, Michigan. {{ISBN|9781943359394}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the global to the individual human scale, each of the seven modalities can be viewed across seven hierarchical levels. Human sustainability can be achieved by attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalities.

===Shaping the future===
Integral elements of sustainability are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]]. It aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme]&lt;/ref&gt;
Encouraging good farming practices ensures farmers fully benefit from the environment and at the same time conserving it for future generations. Additionally, instigating innovative and sustainable travel and transportation solutions must play a vital role in this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Val|last2=Ross|first2=Tracy|last3=Sims|first3=Ruth|last4=Parker|first4=Christopher J.|title=Empirical investigation of the impact of using co-design methods when generating proposals for sustainable travel solutions|journal=CoDesign|date=2015|volume=12|issue=4|pages=205–220|doi=10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/18877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resiliency==
[[wikt:resilience|Resiliency]] in ecology is the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic structure and viability. Resilience-thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human-constructed systems and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way despite the fact that to [[policymaker]]s a definition remains elusive. Resilience-thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the service's current and future generations need from them.  It is also concerned with commitment from [[geopolitical]] policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life?&lt;ref&gt;Brian Walker and David Salt, ''Resilience Practice: Building Capacity to Absorb Disturbance and Maintain Function''. Island Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The resiliency of an ecosystem, and thereby, its sustainability, can be reasonably measured at [[juncture]]s or events where the combination of [[nature|naturally]] occurring [[Regenerative (design)|regenerative]] forces ([[solar energy]], water, soil, [[atmosphere]], vegetation, and [[biomass]]) interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Falk, ''The resilient farm and homestead''. Chelsea Green Publishing, 2013, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A practical view of sustainability is [[closed system]]s that maintain processes of [[productivity]] indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin K. Hendrix, Sustainable Backyard Polyculture: Designing for ecological resiliency. Smashwords Edition, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced. In nature, the accounting occurs naturally through a process of [[adaptation]] as an ecosystem returns to [[wikt:viability|viability]] from an external disturbance. The adaptation is a multi-stage process that begins with the disturbance event (earthquake, volcanic eruption, hurricane, tornado, flood, or thunderstorm), followed by [[dissipation|absorption]], [[utilization]], or [[wikt:rejection|deflection]] of the [[energy]] or energies that the external forces created.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Walker and David Salt, ''Resilience Thinking: Sustaining ecosystems and people in a changing world''. Island Press, 2006. p. xiii; Crawford S. Holling, Adaptive environmental assessment and management. Wiley, 1978. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In analysing systems such as urban and national parks, dams, farms and gardens, theme parks, open-pit mines, water catchments, one way to look at the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a long-term vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events.&lt;ref&gt;Walker and Salt, Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles and concepts==

The philosophical and analytic framework of sustainability draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields; in recent years an area that has come to be called [[sustainability science]] has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Kates, Robert W., ed. (2010). [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/centers-programs/centers/cid/publications/faculty/wp/213.pdf Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology – an introduction to the key literatures of sustainability science] CID Working Paper No. 213. Center for International Development, Harvard University. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scale and context===
Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales (levels or frames of reference) of time and space and in many contexts of environmental, social and economic organization. The focus ranges from the total [[carrying capacity]] (sustainability) of planet Earth to the sustainability of economic sectors, ecosystems, countries, municipalities, neighbourhoods, home gardens, individual lives, individual goods and services{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}, occupations, lifestyles, behaviour patterns and so on. In short, it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it.&lt;ref&gt;Conceptual Framework Working Group of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. (2003). "Ecosystems and Human Well-being." London: [[Island Press]]. Chapter 5. "Dealing with Scale". pp. 107–124. {{ISBN|9781559634038}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Daniel Botkin, author and environmentalist, has stated: "We see a landscape that is always in flux, changing over many scales of time and space."&lt;ref&gt;Botkin, D.B. (1990). ''Discordant Harmonies, a New Ecology for the 21st century''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507469-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sheer size and complexity of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability. To shed light on the big picture, explorer and sustainability campaigner [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]] has drawn parallels to other, more tangible [[closed systems]]. For example, he likens human existence on Earth&amp;nbsp;— isolated as the planet is in space, whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated [[depletion of resources]]&amp;nbsp;— to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lecture by [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]] to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in London|title=Sustainability Lessons From Life On A Small Boat|url=http://www.jasonexplorer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rgs_sustainability_end_piece_broadband.mov|date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, he argues, exercising the [[precautionary principle]] is a key factor in survival.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Jason "[http://www.billyfishbooks.com/Books.html The Seed Buried Deep (The Expedition Trilogy, part 2)]" BillyFish Books, December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumption===
A major driver of human impact on Earth systems is the destruction of [[biophysical]] [[resources]], and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D. (2006). ''A Rough Guide to Ethical Living''. London: Penguin. {{ISBN|978-1-84353-792-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brower&gt;Brower, M. &amp; Leon, W. (1999). ''The Consumer's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices: Practical Advice from the Union of Concerned Scientists''. New York: Three Rivers Press. {{ISBN|0-609-80281-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the 1970s and is called the [[I PAT]] formula. This formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components: [[population]] numbers, levels of consumption (which it terms "affluence", although the usage is different), and impact per unit of resource use (which is termed "technology", because this impact depends on the [[technology]] used). The equation is expressed:

:::::::: I = P × A × T

::: Where: I = Environmental impact, P = Population, A = Affluence, T = Technology&lt;ref name=Ehrlich&amp;Holden&gt;{{cite magazine | last1 = Ehrlich | first1 = P.R. | last2 = Holden | first2 = J.P. | year = 1974 | title = Human Population and the global environment | url = |magazine= American Scientist | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 282–292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circularity ==
In recent years, concepts based on (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts might be the [[Circular Economy]], with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also a broad range of similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geissdoerfer|first=Martin|last2=Savaget|first2=Paulo|last3=Bocken|first3=Nancy M.

The [[Ecological footprint]] measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. In 2008 it required 2.7 [[global hectare]]s per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming no provision for other organisms).&lt;ref name="LPR"/&gt; The resulting [[ecological deficit]] must be met from unsustainable ''extra'' sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. [[fossil fuels]]); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g. by [[Overexploitation|over exploiting]] [[Forests#Forest management and forest loss|forests]] and [[fisheries management|fisheries]]).

The figure (right) examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN [[Human Development Index]] (a measure of standard of living). The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable. As always, [[population growth]] has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich&amp;Holden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams &amp; Jeanrenaud (2008) p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels; that is, to not exceed "one planet" consumption. Information generated by reports at the national, regional and city scales confirm the global trend towards societies that are becoming less sustainable over time.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP Grid Arendal.

[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|progenitor]] in [[economics]] and a [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]], has argued that the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674257801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|303}} Leading ecological economist and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]], a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Daly's concession|propounded the same argument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daly |first=Herman E., ed. |authorlink=Herman Daly |edition=2nd |date=1980 |title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics.

At the enterprise scale, carrying capacity now also plays a critical role in making it possible to measure and report the sustainability performance of individual organizations.  This is most clearly demonstrated through use of [[Context-Based Sustainability]] (CBS) tools, methods and metrics, including the MultiCapital Scorecard, which have been in development since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McElroy|first1=Mark|title=Social Footprints|date=2008|publisher=University of Groningen|isbn=978-0-615-24274-3|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/13147558/00-titlecon.pdf|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Martin|last2=McElroy|first2=Mark|title=The MultiCapital Scorecard|date=2016|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|isbn=9781603586900}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to many other mainstream approaches to measuring the sustainability performance of organizations – which tend to be more incrementalist in form – CBS is explicitly tied to social, environmental and economic limits and thresholds in the world.  Thus, rather than simply measure and report changes in relative terms from one period to another, CBS makes it possible to compare the impacts of organizations to organization-specific norms, standards or thresholds for what they (the impacts) would have to be in order to be empirically sustainable (i.e., which if generalized to a larger population would not fail to maintain the sufficiency of vital resources for human or non-human well-being).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McElroy|first1=Mark|last2=Jorna|first2=Rene|last3=van Engelen|first3=Jo|title=Sustaiability Quotients and the Social Footprint|journal=Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management|date=2007|volume=15|issue=4|pages=223–234|doi=10.1002/csr.164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McElroy|first1=Mark|last2=van Engelen|first2=Jo|title=Corporate Sustainability Management|date=2012|publisher=Earthscan|isbn=978-1-84407-911-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Millennium Ecosystem Assessment'' is an international synthesis by over 1000 of the world's leading biological scientists that analyzes the state of the Earth's [[ecosystem]]s and provides summaries and guidelines for decision-makers. It concludes that human activity is having a significant and escalating impact on the biodiversity of world [[ecosystems]], reducing both their [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and [[biocapacity]]. The report refers to natural systems as humanity's "life-support system", providing essential "[[ecosystem services]]". The assessment measures 24 ecosystem services concluding that only four have shown improvement over the last 50 years, 15 are in serious decline, and five are in a precarious condition.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 6–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainable development===
According to the data that member countries represented to the [[United Nations]], [[Cuba]] was the only country in the world in 2006 that met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of [[sustainable development]], with an [[ecological footprint]] of less than 1.8 hectares per capita, 1.5, and a [[Human Development Index]] of over 0.8, 0.855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Zoological Society of London]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fanelli, Daniele (3 October 2007) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140209164418/http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm World failing on sustainable development].

==Environmental dimension==
Healthy ecosystems provide vital goods and services to humans and other organisms. There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing [[ecosystem services]] and the first of these is [[environmental management]]. This direct approach is based largely on information gained from [[earth science]], [[environmental science]] and [[conservation biology]].
However, this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use.

Management of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from [[economics]]. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources should provide a [[sustainable yield]] (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Daly | first1 = H.E. | year = 1990 | title = Toward some operational principles of sustainable development | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1016/0921-8009(90)90010-r| bibcode = 2005ecec.book.....C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental management===
{{Main|Sustainability and environmental management}}
At the global scale and in the broadest sense environmental management involves the [[ocean]]s, [[freshwater]] systems, land and [[atmosphere]], but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.noaa.gov/?goal=ecosystems&amp;file=users/|title=The Economics and Social Benefits of NOAA Ecosystems Data and Products Table of Contents Data Users|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2009-10-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325190416/http://www.economics.noaa.gov/?goal=ecosystems|archivedate=25 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchenrieder, G., und A.R.

At a March 2009 meeting of the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]], 2,500 climate experts from 80 countries issued a keynote statement that there is now "no excuse" for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction "abrupt or irreversible" shifts in climate may occur that "will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with".&lt;ref&gt;University of Copenhagen (March 2009) [http://climatecongress.ku.dk/newsroom/congress_key_messages/ "Key Messages from the Congress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316181631/http://climatecongress.ku.dk/newsroom/congress_key_messages/ |date=16 March 2009 }} News item on Copenhagen Climate Congress in March 2009.

Retrieved on: 2009-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Management of the global atmosphere now involves assessment of all aspects of the [[carbon cycle]] to identify opportunities to address human-induced [[climate change]] and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on biodiversity and human communities (see [[Energy]] below).

Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the [[air pollution]] in cities, the [[pollutants]] including toxic chemicals like [[nitrogen oxides]], [[Sulfur dioxide|sulfur oxides]], [[volatile organic compounds]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]] that produce [[photochemical smog]] and [[acid rain]], and the [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s that degrade the [[ozone layer]]. [[human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] particulates such as sulfate [[aerosol]]s in the atmosphere reduce the direct [[irradiance]] and reflectance ([[albedo]]) of the [[Earth]]'s surface. Known as [[global dimming]], the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global [[water cycle]] by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gases]] on [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl, G.C. ''et al''. (2007).

====Freshwater and oceans====
[[File:Bleached coral.jpg|thumb|Changes in environmental conditions lead to [[coral bleaching]] and harm to biodiversity of fragile marine ecosystems. ]]
Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the [[ocean]]s and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. The remaining freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however there is still a limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for [[ecosystem services]] has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world's [[wetlands]] have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing [[urbanization]] pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;Clarke &amp; King (2006) pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.&lt;ref name="water"&gt;Hoekstra, A.Y.

Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as [[natural capital]] is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the [[biosphere]] because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to [[urbanisation]], [[agriculture]], [[forest]], [[woodland]], [[grassland]] and [[pasture]] have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs (2001) pp. 560–582.&lt;/ref&gt; At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from [[sustainable gardening|sustainable parks and gardens]] and [[green cities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G6220 Organic Gardening Techniques], ''Missouri University Extension''.

===Management of human consumption===
{{Further|Consumption (economics)}}
[[File:Helix of sustainability.png|right|thumb|alt=Diagram showing ways that the manufacturing process can reduce the use of energy|Helix of sustainability—the [[carbon cycle]] of manufacturing]]
The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis, L. &amp; Lorek, S. (2004). [http://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/publications/2004/87-7614-193-4/pdf/87-7614-194-2.pdf "Consumption and the Environment in Europe: Trends and Futures."] Danish Environmental Protection Agency. Environmental Project No. 904.&lt;/ref&gt; This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, T. &amp; Michaelis, L. (2003). [http://www.sdcommission.gov.uk/pubs/suscon/ "Policies for Sustainable Consumption"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The UK [[Sustainable Development Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), [[resource intensity]], and [[resource productivity]] are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are [[food]], [[energy]], materials and water.

In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx ''Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production: Priority Products and Materials''] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160513215416/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |date=13 May 2016 }} 2010, [[International Resource Panel]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt; and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries. The study found that the most critical impacts are related to [[ecosystem]] health, human health and [[resource depletion]]. From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, agriculture and [[fisheries]] have the most important impacts. Meanwhile, from a final [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, [[food]] and energy-using products cause the majority of [[life cycle assessment|life-cycle]] impacts of consumption.

The Sun's energy, stored by plants ([[primary producer]]s) during [[photosynthesis]], passes through the [[food chain]] to other organisms to ultimately power all living processes. Since the [[industrial revolution]] the concentrated energy of the [[Sun]] stored in fossilized plants as [[fossil fuel]]s has been a major driver of [[technology]] which, in turn, has been the source of both economic and political power. In 2007 climate scientists of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] concluded that there was at least a 90% probability that atmospheric increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was human-induced, mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but, to a lesser extent from changes in land use. Stabilizing the world's climate will require high-income countries to reduce their emissions by 60–90% over 2006 levels by 2050 which should hold CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels at 450–650&amp;nbsp;ppm from current levels of about 380&amp;nbsp;ppm. Above this level, temperatures could rise by more than 2&amp;nbsp;°C to produce "catastrophic" [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;IPCC (2007).[http://www.ipcc.ch/ "''Climate Change 2007: the Physical Science Basis.

[[Water security]] and [[food security]] are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four times greater than the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the [[economy]]—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive [[dam]] construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, affected their [[water quality]] and had a significant impact on the global water cycle.&lt;ref name="Shik" /&gt; Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if [[climate change]] impacts become more severe, [[population]]s increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; King (2006) pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for [[industry]], and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.&lt;ref name="Shik"&gt;Shiklamov, I.

A recent UNEP report proposes a [[green economy]] defined as one that "improves human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities": it "does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of [[natural capital]]". The report makes three key findings: "that greening not only generates increases in wealth, in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital, but also (over a period of six years) produces a higher rate of GDP growth"; that there is "an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons, arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor"; "in the transition to a green economy, new jobs are created, which in time exceed the losses in "brown economy" jobs. However, there is a period of job losses in transition, which requires investment in re-skilling and re-educating the workforce".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environmental Program (2011).

In [[economic]] and [[Environmental policy|environmental]] fields, the term [[Eco-economic decoupling|decoupling]] is becoming increasingly used in the context of economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to [[environmental quality]].&lt;ref name=Costanza/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, C.J. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Biophysical_economics "Biophysical economics"], ''[[Encyclopedia of Earth]]'', Last updated: 14 September 2006. Retrieved on: 2009-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year—three times its current rate of consumption—unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/ Decoupling: natural resource use and environmental impacts of economic growth]. International Resource Panel report, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce [[resource intensity]] (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, H. (1996). ''Beyond Growth: The Economics of Sustainable Development''. Boston: Beacon Press. {{ISBN|0-8070-4709-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are conflicting views whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. On the one hand, it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit [[GDP]]) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Von Weizsacker, E.U. (1998). ''Factor Four: Doubling Wealth, Halving Resource Use'', Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Weizsacker, E.U., C. Hargroves, M.H. Smith, C. Desha, and P. Stasinopoulos (2009). ''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'', Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, in large part because of the [[rebound effect (conservation)]] or [[Jevons Paradox]] resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, M.H., and J.A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 5, "In Search of Solutions II: Efficiency Improvements", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cleveland | first1 = C.J. | last2 = Ruth | first2 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Indicators of Dematerialization and the Materials Intensity of Use | url = | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 15–50 | doi=10.1162/jiec.1998.2.3.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., [[second law of thermodynamics]]) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, M.H., and J.A. Huesemann (2011).[http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution, i.e., economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a [[steady state economy]] in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by [[Herman Daly]] and others in the [[ecological economics]] community.

A different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the ''restore'' approach.&lt;ref name="restore"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bindewald|first1=Eckart|title=An R of sustainability that can tame the "conundrum"|journal=PeerJ PrePrints|date=2013|page=1:e46v1|doi=10.7287/peerj.preprints.46v1|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach views "restore" as a fourth component to the common reduce, reuse, recycle motto. Participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources. These financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects, but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects.&lt;ref name="restore"/&gt;

However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nemetz | first1 = P.N. | year = 2003 | title = Basic Concepts of Sustainable Development for Business Students | url = | journal = Journal of International Business Education | volume = 1 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic [[externalities]] they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the [[Tragedy of the Commons]].&lt;ref name = Tragedy/&gt;

# The urge to accumulate (the [[profit motive]]) drives capitalists to continually reinvest and expand production, creating indefinite and unsustainable economic growth&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 42–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kovel 2007, pp. 38, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Capital tends to degrade the conditions of its own production" (the ecosystems and resources on which any economy depends)&lt;ref name="Kovel 2007, p. 38"&gt;Kovel 2007, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, according to this analysis:

# Giving economic priority to the fulfillment of [[Human rights|human needs]] while staying within ecological limits, as [[sustainable development]] demands, is in conflict with the structural workings of capitalism&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A steady-state capitalist economy is impossible;&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; further, a steady-state capitalist economy is socially undesirable due to the inevitable outcome of massive [[Unemployment|unemployment and underemployment]]&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 42, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Capitalism will, unless overcome by [[revolution]], run up against the physical limits of the biosphere and [[Societal collapse|self-destruct]]&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 27, 122–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this logic, market-based solutions to ecological crises ([[ecological economics]], [[environmental economics]], [[green economy]]) are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism's structural failures.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kovel 2007, pp. 173–87.&lt;/ref&gt; "Low-risk" technology/science-based solutions such as [[solar power]], [[sustainable agriculture]], and increases in [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] are seen as necessary but insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 108–9.&lt;/ref&gt; "High-risk" technological solutions such as [[nuclear power]] and [[climate engineering]] are entirely rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 111–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts made by businesses to "[[Greenwashing|greenwash]]" their practices are regarded as false advertising, and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology (such as [[Walmart]]'s proposition to supply their electricity with solar power) has [[Jevons paradox|the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption]], viz. further economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 102–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sustainable business]] models and the [[triple bottom line]] are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the [[distribution of wealth]] to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable/unsustainable.&lt;ref name="Kovel 2007, p. 38"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate—and capitalist governments to implement—constraints on maximum profit (such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures) renders [[Environmental law|environmental reforms]] incapable of facilitating large-scale change: "History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements ... at a certain point, at which the system's underlying accumulation drive is affected, its resistance to environmental demands stiffens."&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; They also note that, up until the event of total [[ecological collapse]], destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation; thus, capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters (i.e. convert to sustainable/ecological production).&lt;ref&gt;Kovel 2007, pp. 285–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosocialists advocate for the [[revolution]]ary succession of capitalism by ecosocialism—an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] economic/political/social structure designed to harmonize human society with non-human ecology and to fulfill [[Human rights|human needs]]—as the only sufficient solution to the present-day ecological crisis, and hence the only path towards sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Kovel 2007, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists, environmental activists, and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in [[Nature]]: "What every environmentalist needs to know ... is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem, and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis, it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom, through social struggle, in order to create a whole new world—in coevolution with the planet."&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social dimension==
{{Further|Social sustainability}}
{{see also|Environmental policy}}

Sustainability issues are generally expressed in [[science|scientific]] and environmental terms, as well as in ethical terms of [[stewardship]], but implementing change is a social challenge that entails, among other things, [[international law|international]] and national [[law]], [[urban planning]] and transport, local and individual [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] and [[ethical consumerism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Agenda 21]] "Declaration of the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development." Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; "The relationship between human rights and human development, [[corporate capitalism|corporate power]] and environmental justice, global poverty and citizen action, suggest that responsible global citizenship is an inescapable element of what may at first glance seem to be simply matters of personal consumer and moral choice."&lt;ref name = Blewitt2008,96&gt;Blewitt, J.

===Peace, security, social justice===

Social disruptions like [[war]], [[crime]] and [[Political corruption|corruption]] divert resources from areas of greatest human need, damage the capacity of societies to plan for the future, and generally threaten human well-being and the environment.&lt;ref name = Blewitt2008,96/&gt; Broad-based strategies for more sustainable social systems include: improved education and the political empowerment of women, especially in developing countries; greater regard for social justice, notably equity between rich and poor both within and between countries; and intergenerational equity.&lt;ref name=Cohen2006/&gt; Depletion of natural resources including fresh water&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/publications/vg/water2/page/3260.aspx "Water and Political Conflicts"] from [[United Nations Environment Programme]] 2008 [http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/ "Vital Water Graphics"] Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; increases the likelihood of "resource wars".&lt;ref&gt;Billon, P.

===Poverty===
{{Further|Poverty}}
A major hurdle to achieve sustainability is the alleviation of poverty. It has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation. Such acknowledgment has been made by the [[Brundtland Report|Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Common Future, From One Earth to One World|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-ov.htm#I|publisher=UN Documents Gathering a body of global agreements}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Millennium Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Millennium Development Goals Report, 2009|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG_Report_2009_ENG.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues: according to the Brundtland report, "poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Common Future, From One Earth to One World|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-ov.htm#I|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs (such as nutrition and medicine) and general well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lusigi|first=Angela|title=Linking Poverty to Environmental Sustainability|url=http://www.povertyandconservation.info/docs/20080524-UNDP-UNEP_Poverty_Environment_Initiative.pdf|publisher=UNDP-UNEP Poverty&amp;nbsp;— Environment Initiative|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As population growth continues to increase, increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials. According to the UN Population Fund, high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated, and the world's poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are fewer children a route to prosperity?|url=http://www.unfpa.org/public/home/factsheets/pid/3856|website=FACT SHEET: Population Growth and Poverty|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=2011-04-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221140406/http://www.unfpa.org/public/home/factsheets/pid/3856|archivedate=21 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment. For example, teaching [[water treatment]] to the poor by boiling their water with [[charcoal]], would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy, whereas using [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] [[solar water disinfection]] would be. Also, sustainable [[best practices]] can involve the [[recycling]] of materials, such as the use of [[plastics recycling|recycled]] [[plastics]] for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country's timber base. Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries, such as [[Bridges to Prosperity]]'s use of wire rope from shipping container [[gantry cranes]] to act as the structural wire rope for [[footbridges]] that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa.

===Human relationship to nature===
According to [[Murray Bookchin]], the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] societies. Bookchin contends that [[capitalism]] and [[Market (economics)|market]] relationships, if unchecked, have the capacity to reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited. Nature is thus treated as a [[commodity]]: "The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital."&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, M. (2004). ''Post Scarcity Anarchism''. Oakland: [[AK Press]], pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25. {{ISBN|978-1-904859-06-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social ecology (theory)|Social ecology]], founded by Bookchin, is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in, indeed are mere symptoms of, dysfunctional social arrangements. Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems implementing recommendations which stem from physical, biological, economic etc., studies, Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, M. (2007). ''Social Ecology and Communalism''. Oakland: AK Press, p.&amp;nbsp;19. {{ISBN|978-1-904859-49-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pure capitalist approach has also been criticized in [[Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change]] to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] the [[effects of global warming]] in this excerpt:

In regards of the United States of America, The Government and the Economy has had a long lasting impact on the environment, but in a problematic way. Policy issues regarding the environment has shown that the country regards the protection of the environment as a "second hand issue." One causation from this is a certain dilemma called "collective action problem" or collective action dilemmas." These occur when individuals, firms, or governments would be better off if they cooperated in the pursuit of a common goal, but, for one reason or another, one or more of those involved choose a less optimal course of action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Policy New Directions for the Twenty-First Century|last=Vig, Norman J.|first=Kraft, Michael E.|publisher=CQPress|year=2018|isbn=|location=2455 Teller Road Thousand Oaks, California|pages=269–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Potoski and Aseem Prakash have made a model establishing 4 cells that are explaining each benefit for the government or the economic process.

[[Deep ecology]] is a movement founded by [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]] that establishes principles for the well-being of all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will improve the ''[[quality of life]]'' rather than the ''[[standard of living]]''. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen.&lt;ref&gt;Devall, W. and G. Sessions (1985). ''Deep Ecology: Living as If Nature Mattered''.

One approach to [[sustainable living]], exemplified by small-scale urban [[Transition Towns|transition towns]] and rural [[ecovillages]], seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of [[simple living]], which maximize [[self-sufficiency]] particularly in food production. These principles, on a broader scale, underpin the concept of a [[bioregionalism|bioregional]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vtcommons.org/journal/2006/02/kirkpatrick-sale-economics-scale-vs-scale-economics-towards-basic-principles-bioregi|title=Economics of Scale vs. the Scale of Economics&amp;nbsp;— Towards Basic Principles of a Bioregional Economy|last=Sale|first=Kirkpatrick|date=24 February 2006|publisher=Vermont Commons|accessdate=2009-10-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028195909/http://www.vtcommons.org/journal/2006/02/kirkpatrick-sale-economics-scale-vs-scale-economics-towards-basic-principles-bioregi|archivedate=28 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches often utilize commons based knowledge sharing of [[open source appropriate technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = J.M. | year = 2012 | title = The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology | doi = 10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 425–431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other approaches, loosely based around [[New Urbanism]], are successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve [[sustainable cities]] which support [[sustainable transport]] and [[Zero carbon housing|zero emission housing]]. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in [[urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, R [http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html "Growing Cooler – the Evidence on Urban Development and Climate Change"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |date=24 December 2010 }}.

==Cultural dimension==
{{Further|Cultural sustainability}}
{{See also|Agenda 21 for culture|United Cities and Local Governments}}

The cultural dimension of sustainability is known as '''[[cultural sustainability]]'''. Important in the advancement of this notion have been the [[United Nations]], [[Unesco]], and in particular their [[Agenda 21]] and [[Agenda 21 for culture]] (now also known as [[Culture 21]]), a program for [[cultural governance]] developed in 2002–2004 and coordinated by [[United Cities and Local Governments|United Cities and Local Governments UCLG]], created in 2004.

===Tourism===

Sustainability is central to underpinning feelings of authenticity in tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryce|first=Derek|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|last4=Taheri|first4=Babak|date=2015-02-01|title=Visitors' engagement and authenticity: Japanese heritage consumption|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517714001642|journal=Tourism Management|volume=46|pages=571–581|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2014.08.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiences can be enhanced when substituting the contrived for the genuine, and at the same time inspire a potentially deleterious appetite for follow-up visits to the real thing: objectively authentic sites untouched by repair or rejuvenation. Feelings of authenticity at a tourist site are thus implicitly linked to sustainable tourism; as the maximisation of existential "felt" authenticity at sites of limited historical provenance increases the likelihood of return visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Farrington|first2=Thomas|last3=Curran|first3=Ross|last4=O'Gorman|first4=Kevin|date=2017-04-11|title=Sustainability and the authentic experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1766">'''Vourukasha''' is the name of a heavenly sea in Zoroastrian mythology. It was created by [[Ahura Mazda]] and in its middle stood the ''Harvisptokhm'' or the "tree of all seeds".&lt;ref name="vendidadp54"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Pg 54&lt;/ref&gt;

== In mythology ==

According to the [[Vendidad]], Ahura Mazda sent the clean waters of Vourukasha down to the earth in order to cleanse the world and sent the water back to the heavenly sea ''Puitika''.&lt;ref name="vendidadp54" /&gt; This phenomenon was later interpreted as the coming and going of the tide.&lt;ref name="vendidadp54" /&gt; At the centre of Vourukasha was located the Harvisptokhm or "tree of all seeds" which contain the seeds of all plants  in the world.&lt;ref name="vendidadp54" /&gt; There is a bird Sinamru on the tree which causes the bough to break and seeds to sprinkle all around when it alights.&lt;ref name="vendidadp54" /&gt;

At the center of the Vourukasha also grows the ''Gaokerena'' or "White [[Haoma]]", considered to be the "king of healing plants".&lt;ref name="vendidadplxix"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Introduction, Pg lxix&lt;/ref&gt; It is surrounded by ten thousand other healing plants.&lt;ref name="vendidadplxix" /&gt;

== Later Allusions ==

In later times, Vourukasha was connected with the [[Persian Sea]] and the ''Puitika'' with the [[Gulf of Oman]].&lt;ref name="vendidadp54" /&gt;

'''Wharite Peak''' is a mountain at the southern end of the [[Ruahine Range]], {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Woodville, New Zealand|Woodville]] in the [[Manawatu-Wanganui]] region of New Zealand. The mountain is home to the main television transmitter for the city of [[Palmerston North]] and the wider Manawatu region.

==Transmitter==
A 1&amp;nbsp;kW television transmitter was established atop Wharite in 1963, relaying [[TVNZ 1|WNTV1]] from Wellington. It was replaced with a 100&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) |publisher= New Zealand Parliament |volume=351 |page=1394 |date= 28 June 1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
