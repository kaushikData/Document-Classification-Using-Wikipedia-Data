This article lists achieved and expected spaceflight events in 2018.

In planetary exploration, the NASA [[InSight]] seismology probe launched in May 2018 and landed on Mars in November. The [[Parker Solar Probe]] launched to explore the [[Sun]] in August 2018, and reached its first perihelion in November, traveling faster than any prior spacecraft. On 20 October the [[ESA]] and [[JAXA]] launched [[BepiColombo]] to [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], on a 10-year mission featuring several flybys and eventually deploying two orbiters in 2025 for local study. The asteroid sampling mission [[Hayabusa2]] reached its target [[162173 Ryugu|Ryugu]] in June,&lt;ref name=ryugu-arrival&gt;{{cite news |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/06/28/japanese-spacecraft-reaches-asteroid-after-three-and-a-half-year-journey/ |title=Japanese spacecraft reaches asteroid after three-and-a-half-year journey |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=28 June 2018 |access-date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the similar [[OSIRIS-REx]] probe will reach [[101955 Bennu|Bennu]] in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/nasa-selects-participating-scientists-for-mission-to-asteroid-bennu |title=NASA Selects Participating Scientists for Mission to Asteroid Bennu |last=Hille |first=Karl |date=9 January 2018 |website=nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2 February 2018 |quote=The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft's arrival date at Bennu has been revised to December 2018, with approach operations starting in August.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China will launch its [[Chang'e 4]] lander/rover in December to attempt the first ever soft landing on the [[far side of the Moon]];&lt;ref name=gbtimes-20180618 /&gt; a communications relay was sent to the [[Earth–Moon L2|second Earth-Moon Lagrange point]] in May. The [[Google Lunar X Prize]] expired on 31 March without a winner for its $20 million grand prize, because none of its five finalist teams were able to launch a commercial [[Moon landing|lunar lander]] mission before the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacenews.com/google-lunar-x-prize-to-end-without-winner/|title=Google Lunar X Prize to end without winner - SpaceNews.com|date=23 January 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a failed launch in 2017, the [[Electron (rocket)|Electron rocket]] reached orbit with its second flight in January; manufactured by [[Rocket Lab]], it is the first orbital rocket equipped with [[electric pump-fed engine]]s.&lt;ref name="popsci_rutherford"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.popsci.com/rocket-labs-got-3d-printed-battery-powered-rocket-engine |title=A 3D-Printed, Battery-Powered Rocket Engine |work=Popular Science |last1=Grush |first1=Loren |date=14 April 2015 |accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February, the Japanese [[SS-520]]-5 rocket (a modified [[sounding rocket]]) successfully delivered a 3U [[CubeSat]] to orbit, thus becoming the lightest and smallest [[orbital launch vehicle]] ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese sounding rocket claims record-breaking orbital launch – NASASpaceFlight.com|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/02/japanese-rocket-record-borbital-launch/|website=www.nasaspaceflight.com|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 February, SpaceX performed the much-delayed [[Falcon Heavy Test Flight|test flight]] of [[Falcon Heavy]],&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/02/spacex-debut-falcon-heavy-demonstration-launch/ |title=SpaceX successfully debuts Falcon Heavy in demonstration launch from KSC |work=NASASpaceflight |first=Chris |last=Gebhardt |date=5 February 2018 |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; carrying [[Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster|a car and a mannequin]] to a [[heliocentric orbit]] beyond Mars.&lt;ref name=PopMech-2018-02-05&gt; {{cite magazine |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a16571489/elon-musk-space-tesla-mars/ |title=Elon Musk's Space Tesla Isn't Going to Mars.

The global activity of the launch industry grew significantly in 2018. 75 launches were conducted in the first nine months, compared with 63 in the same time in 2017, a 19% increase. In August, China surpassed its previous record of 22 launches in 2016, and is on track to perform 38 to 40 launches over the full year. On 29 November, the 98th launch of the year occurred, a level of activity [[1992 in spaceflight|last seen in 1992]], and 21 launches remained scheduled until year end.

== Orbital launch statistics ==
{{See also|Timeline of spaceflight}}

=== By country ===
For the purposes of this section, the yearly tally of orbital launches by country assigns each flight to the country of origin of the rocket, not to the launch services provider or the spaceport. For example, [[Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre|Soyuz launches by Arianespace in Kourou]] are counted under Russia because [[Soyuz-2]] is a Russian rocket.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Ace2007venue.jpg|frame|The Broad Street Ballroom]] --&gt;
The inaugural ACE Film Festival took place from August 24 to 26 at the Broad Street Ballroom, 41 [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]], right in the center of [[Financial District, Manhattan|Manhattan's Financial District]] and in close proximity to the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. One of the upper floors on the venue was transformed into "Club Ace", a networking lounge where a variety of activities took place.The independent director [[Caveh Zahedi]], was a guest speaker.

A portion of the festival's ticket proceeds were donated to the [[New York Foundation for the Arts]] in an effort to support its efforts in "spreading the gift of creativity." The festival was also part of the River to River Festival, the "largest annual cultural and arts event in New York City's history."

Among the films screened was Robert Liano's and Tom Coppola's ''[[A Broad Way]]'', a documentary film shot over the period of one hour by more than 400 filmmakers, dispersed along 258 blocks of New York City's famous [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17086">'''Adverse selection''' is a term commonly used in [[economics]], [[insurance]], and [[risk management]] that describes a situation where market participation is affected by asymmetric information. When buyers and sellers have different information, it is known as a state of [[information asymmetries|asymmetric information]]. Traders with better private information about the quality of a product will selectively participate in trades which benefit them the most, at the expense of the other trader. A textbook example is Akerlof's [[The Market for Lemons|market for lemons]].

The party without the information is worried about an unfair ("rigged") trade, which occurs when the party who has all the information uses it to their advantage. The fear of rigged trade can prompt the worried party to withdraw from the interaction, diminishing the volume of trade in the market. This can cause a knock-on effect and the unraveling of the market. An additional implication of this potential for market collapse is that it can work as an entry deterrence that leads to high margins without additional entry.

Buyers sometimes have better information about how much benefit they can extract from a service.  For example, an all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant that sets one price for all customers risks being adversely selected against by high appetite and hence, the least profitable customers. The restaurant has no way of knowing whether a given customer has a high or low appetite. The customer is the only one who knows if they have a high or low appetite. In this case the high appetite customers are more likely to use the information they have and to go to the restaurant.

In this case, the seller suffering from adverse selection can protect himself by screening customers or by identifying credible signals of appetite. Some examples of this phenomenon occur in [[signaling games]] and [[screening games]].

An example where the buyer is adversely selected against is in financial markets. A company is more likely to offer stock when managers privately know that the current stock price exceeds the fundamental value of the firm. Uninformed investors rationally demand a premium to participate in the equity offer. While this example functions as a good hypothetical example of the buyer being adversely selected against, in reality the market can know that the managers are selling stocks (perhaps in required company reports). The market price of stocks will then reflect the information that managers are selling stocks.

== Moral hazard ==
Adverse selection is related to the concept of [[moral hazard]].  Where adverse selection describes a situation where the ''type'' of product is hidden from one party in a transaction, moral hazard describes a situation where there is a hidden ''action'' that results from the transaction. For example, the concept of moral hazard suggests that customers who have insurance may be more likely to behave recklessly than those who do not have insurance.

==Insurance==
The term "adverse selection" was originally used in [[insurance]]. It describes a situation where an individual's demand for insurance is positively correlated with the individual's risk of loss.

This can be illustrated by the link between smoking status and mortality. Non-smokers typically live longer than smokers. If a life insurance company does not vary prices according to smoking status, its life insurance will be more valuable for smokers than for non-smokers. Smokers will have greater incentives to buy insurance from that company and will purchase insurance in larger amounts than non-smokers. As smokers are at higher risk of early death due to their smoking status, and more smokers than non smokers will purchase life insurance, the average mortality rate increases. This increase means the insurer will spend more on policy payments, leading to losses.

In response, the company may increase premiums. However, higher prices cause rational non-smoking customers to cancel their insurance. The higher prices combined with their lower risk of mortality make life insurance uneconomic for non-smokers. This can exacerbate the adverse selection problem. As more smokers take out life insurance policies and increase the insurer's mortality rate, its prices will continue to rise, which in turn will mean fewer non-smokers will purchase insurance. Eventually, the higher prices will push out all non-smokers and the insurer will also be unwilling to sell to smokers.  No more interactions will take place, and the life insurance market will collapse.

To counter the effects of adverse selection, insurers may offer premiums that are proportional to a customer's risk. The insurer screens customers to distinguish high-risk individuals from low-risk individuals. For instance, medical insurance companies ask a range of questions and may request medical or other reports on individuals who apply to buy insurance. The premium can be varied accordingly and any unreasonably high-risk individuals are rejected. This risk selection process is one part of [[underwriting]]. In many countries, insurance law incorporates an "utmost good faith" or ''[[uberrima fides]]'' doctrine, which requires potential customers to answer any questions asked by the insurer fully and honestly. Dishonesty may be met with refusals to pay claims.

=== Evidence of adverse selection in insurance markets ===
Empirical evidence of adverse selection is mixed. Several studies investigating correlations between risk and insurance purchase have failed to show the predicted positive correlation for life insurance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cawley |first=J. |last2=Philipson |first2=T. |title=An Empirical Examination of Barriers to Trade in Insurance |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=89 |issue=4 |year=1999 |pages=827–846 |jstor=117161 |doi=10.1257/aer.89.4.827}}&lt;/ref&gt; auto insurance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chiappori |first=P. A. |last2=Salanie |first2=B. |year=2000 |title=Testing for Asymmetric Information in Insurance Markets |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=56–78 |doi=10.1086/262111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dionne |first=G. |last2=Gouriéroux |first2=C. |last3=Vanasse |first3=C. |year=2001 |title=Testing for Evidence of Adverse Selection in the Automobile Insurance Market: A Comment |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=444–453 |doi=10.1086/319557 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cardon |first=J. H. |last2=Hendel |first2=I. |title=Asymmetric information in health insurance: evidence from the National Medical Expenditure Survey |year=2001 |journal=Rand Journal of Economics |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=408–427 |jstor=2696362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, "positive" test results for adverse selection have been reported in health insurance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David M. |last=Cutler |first2=Richard J. |last2=Zeckhauser |title=Adverse Selection in Health Insurance |journal=Forum for Health Economics &amp; Policy |volume=1 |issue= |year=1998 |pages=Article 2 |url=http://www.bepress.com/fhep/1/2 |doi=10.2202/1558-9544.1056}}&lt;/ref&gt; long-term care insurance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Finkelstein |first=A. |last2=McGarry |first2=K. |year=2006 |doi=10.1257/aer.96.4.938 |title=Multiple dimensions of private information: evidence from the long-term care insurance market |journal=American Economic Review |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=938–958 |pmc=3022330 |jstor=30034325 |pmid=21253439}}&lt;/ref&gt; and annuity markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Finkelstein |first=A. |last2=Poterba |first2=J. |doi=10.1086/379936 |title=Adverse selection in insurance markets: policyholder evidence from the UK annuity market |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=112 |issue=1 |year=2004 |pages=183–208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weak evidence of adverse selection in certain markets suggests that the [[underwriting]] process is effective at screening high-risk individuals. Another possible reason is the negative correlation between [[risk aversion]] (such as the willingness to purchase insurance) and risk level (estimated beforehand based on hindsight observation of the occurrence rate for other observed claims) in the population. If risk aversion is higher among lower-risk customers, adverse selection can be reduced or even reversed, leading to "advantageous" selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hemenway|first=D.|year=1990|title=Propitious selection|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]|volume=105|issue=4|pages=1063–1069|doi=10.2307/2937886|jstor=2937886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Meza|first=D.|last2=Webb|first2=D. C.|year=2001|title=Advantageous selection in insurance markets|journal=RAND Journal of Economics|volume=32|issue=2|pages=249–262|jstor=2696408}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when a person is both less likely to engage in risk-increasing behavior are more likely to engage in risk-decreasing behavior, such as taking affirmative steps to reduce risk.

For example, there is evidence that smokers are more willing to do risky jobs than non-smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Viscusi |first=W. K. |last2=Hersch |first2=J. |doi=10.1162/00346530151143806 |title=Cigarette smokers as job risk takers |journal=Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=83 |issue=2 |year=2001 |pages=269–280 |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This greater willingness to accept risk may reduce insurance policy purchases by smokers.

From a public policy viewpoint, some adverse selection can also be advantageous. Adverse selection may lead to a higher fraction of total losses for the whole population being covered by insurance than if there were no adverse selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=R. G. |year=2008 |title=Loss coverage as a public policy objective for risk classification schemes |journal=Journal of Risk &amp; Insurance |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=997–1018 |doi=10.1111/j.1539-6975.2008.00294.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In capital markets ==
When raising capital, some types of securities are more prone to adverse selection than others.  An equity offering for a company that reliably generates earnings at a good price will be bought up before an unknown company's offering, leaving the market filled with less desirable offerings that were unwanted by other investors. Assuming that managers have inside information about the firm, outsiders are most prone to adverse selection in equity offers. This is because managers may offer stock when they know the offer price exceeds their private assessments of the company's value. Outside investors therefore require a high rate of return on equity to compensate them for the risk of buying a "lemon".

Adverse selection costs are lower for debt offerings. When debt is offered, outside investors infer that managers believe the current stock price is undervalued. Managers would otherwise be keen on offering equity.

Thus the required returns on debt and equity are related to perceived adverse selection costs, implying that debt should be cheaper than equity as a source of external capital, forming a "[[Pecking order theory|pecking order]]" .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Corporate financing and investment decisions when firms have information that investors do not have|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304405X84900230||accessdate = 2015-09-02|doi=10.1016/0304-405X(84)90023-0|volume=13|journal=Journal of Financial Economics|pages=187–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This example assumes that the market does not knows managers are selling stock. The market could possess this information, perhaps finding it in company reports. In this case, the market will capitalize on the information found in company reports. If the market has access to the company's information, there is no longer a state of adverse selection.

== In contract theory ==
In modern [[contract theory]], the term "adverse selection" is simply used to categorize principal-agent models in which an agent has private information already ''before'' a contract is written.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The theory of incentives: The principal-agent model|last = Laffont|first = Jean Jacques|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Martimort|first2 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contract theory|last = Bolton|first = Patrick|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Dewatripont|first2 = Matthias}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a worker may know his effort costs (or a buyer may know his willingness-to-pay) ''before'' an employer (or a seller) makes a contract offer. In contrast, the term "[[moral hazard]]" is used for principal-agent models, where there is symmetric information at the time of contracting. The agent may become privately informed ''after'' the contract is written. According to Hart and Holmström (1987), moral hazard models are further subdivided into hidden action and hidden information models, depending on whether the agent becomes privately informed due to an unobservable action that he himself chooses or due to a random move by nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advances in Economic Theory|last = Hart|first = Oliver|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = 71–155|last2 = Holmström|first2 = Bengt|editor-last = Bewley, T.|chapter = The theory of contracts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the difference between an adverse selection model and a hidden information (sometimes called hidden knowledge) model is simply the timing. In the former case, the agent is informed at the outset. In the latter case, he becomes privately informed after the contract has been signed.

Adverse selection models can be further categorized in models with private values and models with interdependent or common values. In models with private values, the agent's type has a direct influence on his own preferences. For example, he has knowledge over his effort costs or his willingness-to-pay. Alternatively, models with interdependent or common values occur when the agent's type has a direct influence on the principal's preferences. For instance, the agent may be a seller who privately knows the quality of a car.

Seminal contributions to private value models have been made by [[Roger Myerson]] and [[Eric Maskin]], while interdependent or common value models have first been studied by [[George Akerlof]]. Adverse selection models with private values can also be further categorized by distinguishing between models with one-sided private information and two-sided private information. The most prominent result in the latter case is the [[Myerson–Satterthwaite theorem|Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem]]. More recently, contract-theoretic adverse selection models have been tested both in laboratory experiments and in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Do sellers offer menus of contracts to separate buyer types?

''' Aero GP''' is an international air racing series with up to eight specially designed high-performance sports planes all racing together at speeds of up to 400&amp;nbsp;km/h (250&amp;nbsp;mph) around a tight circuit just metres off the ground and from each other.&lt;ref name="home" /&gt; The competing pilots are military and civilian pilots from around the world. Aero GP is the only international, televised event where aeroplanes race simultaneously. Aero GP officially started in 2005 in Slovenia. From there it has travelled to several countries in Europe and Middle East. Instead of the checked flag pattern, Aero GP judges its participants on the basis on points won in individual events and hence, there is no clear winner till the end.&lt;ref name="dmail"/&gt;

== Competitive elements ==

Three primary disciplines in series decide the annual ''World Champion Flying Ace'':

'''Air Racing:'''  All racing at the same time, between six and eight aircraft reach speeds of 500&amp;nbsp;km/h at just 10 metres above the racecourse.

'''Air Combat:'''  A real air-to-air “dogfight”.  Pilots take to the skies in an attempt to outmanoeuvre, hunt down and shoot each other out of the sky, in the style of military air combat.

'''Barnstorming:'''  A third element which can consist of any of the following - depending on the venue: aerobatics, stunt flying or precision target dropping - pilots drop bombs from their aircraft at low altitude, aiming at various targets.

== History ==
The first Aero GP was held in 2005 although the concept dates to 2000. The inaugural event, held in Slovenia, was televised in over 100 countries. Since then Aero GP's have been held in Malta, Romania (twice), The United Kingdom, and Abu Dhabi in the UAE.

== The Pilots ==

Aero GP pilots have backgrounds in flying a range of military and aerobatic aircraft. They come from a variety of countries and backgrounds.  Fighter pilots,  aerobatics champions,  and civil aviation pilots are all known to compete. They are put through tremendous amounts of G-Force when performing in their aircraft.&lt;ref name="dmail"/&gt;

== 2008 series ==
The series consisted of two Aero GP's. June saw the Aero GP team return to Constanta [http://www.lussoluxury.com/content.asp/read-111062008123157/British_Pilot_Wins_Aero_GP.html]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in Romania and this was followed by a second round in Blackpool, UK.

== 2009 series ==

The 2009 series sees Aero GP visit the Middle East for the first time. Aero GP will be headlining the Al Ain air show in the United Arab Emirates between January 29–31. There are multiple other venues being discussed for 2009 and these will be announced in the new year.&lt;ref name="abu"/&gt;

== Accidents ==

During the Malta show on 10 September 2006, two planes, an [[Extra EA-200]] and a [[Yakovlev Yak-55]], collided just outside [[Marsamxett Harbour]] off [[Valletta]]. The Swedish pilot of the Yak-55, aerobatics champion [[Gabor Varga]], died instantly. However, the Irish Extra 200 pilot, Eddie Goggins, suffered only minor injuries and was soon released after the crash.&lt;ref name="airsports"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first = | authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Stunt pilot dies in crash over Marsamxett| work = MaltaMedia News

'''''Barack the Barbarian''''' is a [[comic book]] series published by [[Devil's Due Publishing]] beginning in June [[2009 in comics|2009]].

==Publication history==
In November 2008, one of Obama's advisers gave an interview to journalist Jon Swaine of The Daily Telegraph titled, "Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know". In the interview, it emerged that Obama collects ''Conan the Barbarian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Swaine |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/3401168/Barack-Obama-The-50-facts-you-might-not-know.html |title=Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=November 7, 2008 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the series originated with Devil's Due publisher Josh Blaylock who explained that "We didn't want to be completely slapsticky. It is definitely partly a gimmick, but we wanted to do something clever with [the Obama comics trend]."&lt;ref name=cbr22279 /&gt; He contacted Larry Hama with his idea for a series called ''Obama the Barbarian'', and Hama described how the idea developed during the course of the phonecall:

{{quote|First off, you should change it to ''Barack the Barbarian'', and second, I'm not interested in writing a [[Mad Magazine]] style parody and that it would have to be more in line with the more polemical stuff of Swift, Twain and Voltaire (not that I can pull off anything like they could,) and third, that my own leanings are towards Barack and that would be reflected in what I write – and Josh said 'fine'.&lt;ref name=newsarama050912 /&gt;}}

The writer has said it is more than just a political satire: "I just think of it as [[sword and sorcery]], only the characters look really familiar."&lt;ref name=newsarama050912 /&gt;

==Collected editions==
The comic books are being collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]:

{{Sri Lankan Tamil history}}
The '''burning of the Jaffna Public Library''' ({{lang-ta|யாழ் பொது நூலகம் எரிப்பு}}, ''Yāḻ potu nūlakam erippu'') was an important event in the [[Sri Lankan civil war]]. An organized mob of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] origin went on a rampage on the night of June 1, 1981, burning the [[Jaffna Public Library|library]]. It was one of the most violent examples of ethnic [[Book burning|biblioclasm]] of the  20th century.{{cref|Term}}&lt;ref name="ifla"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla72/papers/119-Knuth-en.pdf |title=Destroying a symbol|accessdate=February 14, 2007 |format= |work=IFLA }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its destruction, the library was one of the biggest in Asia, containing over 97,000 books and manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2007/02/070202_kandy_library.shtml|title=Fire at Kandy public library|accessdate=March 14, 2006 |work=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, A.J. ''Sri Lankan Tamil Nationalism: Its Origins and Development in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The library was built in many stages starting from 1933, from a modest beginning as a private collection. Soon, with the help of primarily local citizens, it became a full-fledged library. The library also became a repository of archival material written in [[palm leaf manuscript]]s, original copies of regionally important historic documents in the contested {{cref|Context}}political history of Sri Lanka and newspapers that were published hundreds of years ago in the [[Jaffna]] [[peninsula]]. It thus became a place of historic and symbolic importance to all Sri Lankans.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/12/12/fea01.html |title=History of the Public Library |accessdate=April 13, 2007 |work=Dailynews |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310145532/http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/12/12/fea01.html |archivedate=March 10, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="priu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/features/20020130jaffna_library.htm|title=The reconstruction of the Jaffna library by Dr. Jayantha Seneviratne|accessdate=April 17, 2006|work=PRIU|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224070539/http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/features/20020130jaffna_library.htm|archivedate=December 24, 2005|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the first major wing of the library was opened in 1959 by then Jaffna mayor [[Alfred Duraiappah]]. The architect of the [[Indo-Saracenic]] style building was S. Narasimhan from [[Madras]], [[India]]. Prominent Indian [[librarian]] [[S.R. Ranganathan]] served as an advisor to ensure that the library was built to international standards. The library became the pride of the local people as even researchers from India and other countries began to use it for their research purposes.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="priu"/&gt;

==The riot and the burning==
[[File:Jaffnalibrary dome.jpeg|thumb|230px|left|Damaged dome with holes made by shelling]]
On Sunday May 31, 1981, the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF), a regionally popular democratic party, held a rally in which three majority [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] policeman were shot and two killed.{{cref|Political situation}}

That night police and paramilitaries began a [[pogrom]] that lasted for three days. The head office of [[TULF]] party was destroyed. The Jaffna MP [[V. Yogeswaran]]'s residence was also destroyed.

Four people were pulled from their homes and killed at random. Many business establishments and a local [[Hindu temple]] were also deliberately destroyed.

On the night of June 1, according to many eyewitnesses, police and government-sponsored paramilitias set fire to the Jaffna public library and destroyed it completely.&lt;ref name="ifla"/&gt; Over 97,000 volumes of books along with numerous culturally important and irreplaceable manuscripts were destroyed.&lt;ref name="priu"/&gt; Among the destroyed items were scrolls of historical value and the works and manuscripts of philosopher, artist and author [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and prominent intellectual Prof. Dr. [[Isaac Thambiah]]. The destroyed articles included memoirs and works of writers and dramatists who made a significant contribution toward the sustenance of the Tamil culture, and those of locally reputed physicians and politicians.&lt;ref name="priu"/&gt;

The office of the ''Eelanaadu,'' a local newspaper, was also destroyed. Statues of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] cultural and religious figures were destroyed or defaced.

[[Nancy Murray]] wrote in a journal article in 1984 that several high-ranking security officers and two [[cabinet minister]]s were present in the town of [[Jaffna]], when uniformed [[security]] men and [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/country_profiles/1166237.stm|title=Chronology of events in Sri lanka|accessdate=March 14, 2006 |format= |work=BBC | date=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; mob carried out organized acts of destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Murray (1984), ''Sri Lanka: Racism and the Authoritarian State,'' Issue no. 1,  Race &amp; Class, vol. 26 (Summer 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; After 20 years the government-owned ''Daily News'' newspaper, in an [[editorial]] in 2001, termed the 1981 event an act by ''goon squads let loose by the then government''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200106/20010608editorialreview.html|title=EDITORIAL, DAILY NEWS|accessdate=March 14, 2006|work=Daily News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040921183752/http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200106/20010608editorialreview.html|archivedate=September 21, 2004|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Two cabinet ministers, who saw the destruction of  government and private properties from the [[verandah]] of the Jaffna Rest House (a government owned hotel), claimed that the incident was 

{{quote|an unfortunate event, where [a] few policeman got drunk and went on a looting spree all on their own}}

The national newspapers did not report the incident. In subsequent parliamentary debates some majority Sinhalese members told minority Tamil politicians that if Tamils were unhappy in Sri Lanka, they should leave for their 'homeland' in India.&lt;ref name="ifla"/&gt; A direct quote from a [[United National Party]] member is 

{{quote|If there is discrimination in this land which is not their (Tamil) homeland, then why try to stay here. Why not go back home (India) where there would be no discrimination.

Of all the destruction in Jaffna city, it was the destruction of the Jaffna Public Library that was the incident which appeared to cause the most distress to the people of Jaffna.&lt;ref name=Peebles&gt;{{cite book |last= Peebles |first= Patrick |title= The History of Sri Lanka |origyear= 2006 |series= The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations |publisher= Greenwood Press |location= Westport, Connecticut |isbn= 0-313-33205-3 |pages= 133 &amp; 134|chapter= chapter 10 |year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ponnambalam&gt;{{cite book |last= Ponnambalam|first= Satchi|title= Sri Lanka: The National Question and the Tamil Liberation Struggle |origyear= 1983 |publisher= Zed Books Ltd. |location= London |isbn= 0-86232-198-0 |pages= 207 &amp; 261 |year= 1983|authorlink=Satchi Ponnambalam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years later, the mayor of Jaffna [[Nadarajah Raviraj]] still grieved at the recollection of the flames he saw as a University student.&lt;ref name="ifla"/&gt;

For Tamils the devastated library became a symbol of "physical and imaginative violence". The attack was seen as an assault on their aspirations, the value of learning and traditions of academic achievement. The attack also became the rallying point for Tamil rebels to promote the idea to the Tamil populace that their race was targeted for annihilation.&lt;ref name="ifla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="priu"/&gt;

===President Ranasinghe Premadasa===
In 1991 the then president of Sri Lanka [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] publicly proclaimed that

{{quote|During the District Development Council elections in 1981, some of our party members took many people from other parts of the country to the North, created havoc and disrupted the conduct of elections in the North. It is this same group of people who are causing trouble now also. If you wish to find out who burnt the priceless collection of books at the Jaffna Library, you have only to look at the faces of those opposing us.}}

He was accusing his political opponents within his [[United National Party|UNP]] party, [[Lalith Athulathmudali]] and [[Gamini Dissanayake]], who had just brought an [[impeachment]] motion against him, as directly involved in the burning of the library in 1981.&lt;ref name="UNP"/&gt;

===President Mahinda Rajapakse===
{{Anti-Tamil riots in Sri Lanka}}
In 2006 the President of Sri Lanka [[Mahinda Rajapakse]] was quoted as saying,

{{quote|The [[United National Party|UNP]] is responsible for mass scale riots and [[Black July|massacres against the Tamils in 1983]], vote rigging in the Northern Development Council elections and [the] burning of the Jaffna library}}

He was also further quoted as saying in reference to a prominent local [[Sri Lankan Tamil|Tamil]] poet, reminding the audience that

{{quote|Burning the Library sacred to the people of Jaffna was similar to shooting down [[Lord Buddha]]}}

He concluded in that speech that as a cumulative effect of all these atrocities, the peaceful voice of the Tamils is now drowned in the echo of the gun; referring to the rebel [[LTTE]]'s [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2005/11/051104_mjaffna.shtml|title=Mahinda promises compensation for high security zone |accessdate=March 14, 2006 |work=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government investigation==
According to [[Orville H. Schell]], Chairman of the Americas Watch Committee, and Head of [[Amnesty International]]'s 1982 fact-finding mission to Sri Lanka, the [[United National Party|UNP]] government at that time did not institute an independent investigation to establish responsibility for these killings in May and June 1981 and take measures against those responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Reopening==
[[File:Jaffnalibrary1-edit1.jpg|thumb|300px|Reft|Jaffna Public Library being rebuilt, with partly burned right wing. At the front is a statue of [[Saraswati]], the Hindu goddess of learning.]]

In 1982, one year after the initial destruction, the community sponsored Jaffna Public Library Week and collected thousands of books. Repairs on parts of the building were in progress when the [[Black July]] pogrom-induced civil conflict began in 1983. By 1984, the library was fully renovated; however, the library was damaged by bullets and bombs. The military forces were stationed in the [[Jaffna Fort|Dutch fort]] and the rebels positioned themselves inside the library creating a [[no man's land]] as the fighting intensified. In 1985, after an attack on a nearby police station by Tamil rebels, soldiers entered the partially restored building and set off bombs that shredded thousands of books yet again.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The library was abandoned with its shell and bullet-pocked walls, blackened with the smoke of burnt books.&lt;ref name="ifla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/08/19/432779251/up-from-the-ashes-a-public-library-in-sri-lanka-welcomes-new-readers|title=Up From The Ashes, A Public Library In Sri Lanka Welcomes New Readers|newspaper=NPR.org|access-date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

As an effort to win back the confidence of the Tamil people&lt;ref name="priu"/&gt; and also to mollify international opinion, in 1998 under president [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]], the government began the process to rebuild it with contributions from all Sri Lankans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sundaytimes.lk/970601/news3.html

Approximately US $1 million was spent and over 25,000 books were collected. By 2001 the replacement building was complete but the 2003 reopening of the rebuilt library was opposed by the [[Rebellion|rebel]] [[LTTE]]. This led all twenty-one members of the  [[Jaffna]] [[municipal council]], led by Mayor [[Sellan Kandian]], to tender their resignation as a protest against the pressure exerted on them to postpone the reopening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=8343

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
* {{cnote|Term|'''Biblioclasm,''' which the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines as the deliberate destruction of books, a cultural offence of the first magnitude. Some of the ancient calamities are destruction of the [[Alexandria]] library in [[Egypt]]. A well-known historic event was the destruction of thousands of books made from the bark of trees and bearing the wisdom of [[Mayan culture]], which were burnt in 1562 in [[Mexico]], because a [[Spain|Spanish]] friar wanted to "cleanse" the natives of "devilish" thoughts. The late 20th century [[China]]'s [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] wiped out artifacts and books in the takeover of [[Tibet]] in the 1960s. [[Pol Pot]] destroyed many books in the [[genocide]] of [[Cambodia]] in the 1970s. On August 25, 1992, the [[Serbs]] extended "[[ethnic cleansing]]" to the National and University Library of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in [[Sarajevo]], resulting in 1.5 million books and manuscripts being incinerated in one night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byform/mailing-lists/exlibris/2004/01/msg00087.html |title=Fragile Guardians of Culture By Nicholas A.

* {{cnote|Context|In the post-colonial era the history of immigration patterns of various ethnic communities from India to Sri Lanka has become a dimension that fuels the ethnic conflict.  Sinhala nationalists maintain that as they descend from the original "Yaksha" clans of Sri Lanka (later mixed with immigrants from India about 2600 years ago), they have special rights to scarce resources, jobs and other opportunities.  Government policies that have favored this interpretation has run into opposition from the minority Tamils who during the colonial period enjoyed an disproportionately large share of available opportunities.  As a response, Tamils too began to emphasize their history of earlier immigration from India.  The library held the only original copy of ''[[Yalpana Vaipava Malai]]'' that documented the rise and fall of the Tamil and Hindu dominated [[Jaffna kingdom]] in the north of the island nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2103/stories/20040213000206000.htm|title= History from the LTTE|accessdate= April 15, 2007|work= Frontline|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071023110036/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2103/stories/20040213000206000.htm|archivedate= October 23, 2007|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* {{cnote|Reaction|Some majority Sinhalese politicians expressed no regrets and used subsequent parliamentary discussion to drive home the message sent by the library’s destruction: if the Tamils were unhappy, they should leave Sri Lanka and return to their homeland, India. Thus the attack on the library was used to send a message of point of no return for negotiations and indicated a willingness to engage the political process with further violence. Thus radical elements within both the communities took over the direction of further conflict management and marginalizing those moderates who wanted to resolve the conflict peacefully.&lt;ref name="ifla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNP"/&gt;}}

Confederates, both veterans and women, were especially active in forging the myth of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Caroline E. Janney, ''Remembering the Civil War: Reunion and the Limits of Reconciliation'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Graves at Arlington on Memorial Day.JPG|thumb|Flags decorate the graves at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] on Memorial Day]]

==Memorial Day==
{{main|Memorial Day|Confederate Memorial Day}}
Most of the war dead are buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] and [[United States National Cemetery|other national cemeteries]] near the battle zones. Memorial Day (or "Decoration Day") originated shortly after the American Civil War to commemorate the Union and Confederate soldiers who died in the Civil War. The Confederates set up a different day at first but then merged it into the national holiday.  By the 20th century, Memorial Day had been extended to honor all Americans who have died while in the military service.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Blight,  "Decoration Day: The Origins of Memorial Day in North and South" in Alice Fahs and Joan Waugh, eds. ''The Memory of the Civil War in American Culture'' (2004), pp 94–129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lost Cause of the Confederacy==
{{main|Lost Cause of the Confederacy}}
The ''Lost Cause'' is the literary and intellectual movement that sought to reconcile the traditional white society of the South to the defeat of their [[Confederate States of America|new nation]].  Gallagher and Nolan say:
:The architects of the Lost Cause acted from various motives. They collectively sought to justify their own actions and allow themselves and other former Confederates to find something positive in all-encompassing failure. They also wanted to provide their children and future generations of white Southerners with a 'correct' narrative of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Gary W. Gallagher, and Alan T. Nolan, eds., ''The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War History'' (2000) p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grant's Tomb==
The death of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1885 was the occasion for commemoration. A funeral train carried the body to New York City, where a quarter of a million people viewed in the two days prior to the funeral.  His pallbearers included Union Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Philip Sheridan]], Confederate Generals [[Simon Bolivar Buckner]] and [[Joseph E. Johnston]], Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]], and John A. Logan, the head of the GAR. His body was laid to rest in the [[General Grant National Memorial]] ("Grant's Tomb"), the largest mausoleum in North America.  Attendance at the New York funeral topped 1.5 million. Ceremonies were held in other major cities around the country.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Brands, ''The Man Who Saved The Union Ulysses S. Grant in War and Peace'' (2012) pp. 633–35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gettysburg Battlefield==
{{main|Gettysburg Battlefield| List of monuments of the Gettysburg Battlefield}}
The Gettysburg battlefield, dedicated by President Lincoln who presented his iconic [[Gettysburg Address]] there in November 1863, contains hundreds of memorials to the regiments that fought there.  Army veterans created the [[Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association]] in 1864, making it one of the earliest historic preservation organizations in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georgie Boge Geraghty |author2=Margie Boge |title=Paving Over the Past: A History And Guide To Civil War Battlefield Preservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q92C7xwkxHgC&amp;pg=PA18|year=1993|publisher=Island Press|page=18|isbn=9781559631921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The battlefield is under the control of the national park Service and is a major tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. National Park Service, [www.nps.gov/gett  ''Gettysburg National Military Park'']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aerial view of Lincoln Memorial - east side EDIT.jpeg|thumb|Lincoln Memorial in Washington]]

==Lincoln Memorial==
{{main|Lincoln Memorial| Memorials to Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln cultural depictions}}
The Lincoln Memorial in Washington was dedicated in 1922. It has become one of the most visited war memorials. It has been the site of many famous celebrations of freedom, most notably [[Marian Anderson: the Lincoln Memorial Concert|Marian Anderson's 1939 Concert]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King's]]  1963 "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Arsenault, ''The Sound of Freedom: Marian Anderson, the Lincoln Memorial, and the concert that awakened America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher A.

==American Civil War Centennial (100)==
{{main|American Civil War Centennial}}
The shadow of ongoing conflict during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] affected implementation of the 100-year commemorative activities.  Neither Congress nor President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] were interested in a risking debate over single, unified, national theme for the commemoration, so the official interpretive work was carried out by the various state commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Cook, ''Troubled Commemoration: The Civil War Centennial, 1961–1965'' (Louisiana State University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the national Commission, key members urged different priorities. Emory University Professor [[Bell I. Wiley]] recommended a major effort to document and preserving information from historic letters, newspapers and public documents. [[Ulysses S. Grant III]], the first chairman, wanted to emphasize large-scale events that appealed to the public, such as "sham battles" or reenactments. Businessman Karl Betts, the first executive director of the Commission, looked for ways it could spur economic development.  They all agreed on a Cold War consensus to the effect that all good Americans were ideologically united, with the result that potentially divisive civil rights issues were not emphasized. The [[National Park Service]] was in overall charge; it wanted Congress to appropriate more money to re-landscape and interpret major battlefields along traditional lines. The Post Office issued a series of noncontroversial [[commemorative stamp]]s to mark the centennial.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, ''Troubled Commemoration: The American Civil War Centennial, 1961–1965'' (2007) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

The state commissions took a sectional perspective, using different key words and phrases to reflect their viewpoints, and sponsored and encouraged different public memorials and activities. Segregation was still in effect but it was under heavy attack by the Civil Rights Movement. The Southern states presented their official view that the infrastructure of [[Jim Crow]] and [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] was an organic reflection of a distinctive Southern "way of life."  Many white Southerners responded with enthusiasm to invitations to celebrate their heritage, which they saw as one of courage on the battlefield and continuity afterwards.  For the first time, many Americans, especially white Southerners, volunteered or were recruited into [[historical reenactment]] groups that performed pageants and re-creations of Civil War battles, field maneuvers, and encampments.&lt;ref name="Edward L. Ayers"&gt;Edward L. Ayers, [http://www.southernspaces.org/2011/civil-war-and-emancipation-150-years The Civil War and Emancipation 150 Years On], ''Southern Spaces'' 17 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War Sesquicentennial (150)==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2017}}
2011 marked the 150th anniversary of the beginning of the American Civil War. Many in the American South attempted to incorporate both [[African-American history|black history]] and white perspectives. A Harris Poll given in March 2011 suggested that Americans were still uniquely divided over the results and appropriate memorials to acknowledge the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Harris Interactive, "150 Years Later Remembering the American Civil War" (2011) [http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/mid/1508/ArticleId/739/Default.aspx/ online]&lt;/ref&gt; While traditionally American films of the Civil War feature "brother versus brother" themes, film treatments of the war are evolving to include African American characters. Benard Simelton, president of the Alabama [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], said celebrating the Civil War is like celebrating the "Holocaust". In reference to slavery, Simelton said that black "rights were taken away" and that blacks "were treated as less than human beings."&lt;ref&gt;David Person, "Should we 'celebrate' the Civil War?" - ''USATODAY Forum'' 2/22/2011 [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2011-02-23-column23_ST_N.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental support===

====National Park Service====
Acknowledging the need for an internet presence, the [[National Park Service]] launched a website about the 150th anniversary and Civil War history featuring a list of NPS events, as well as creating several digital humanities projects. These projects included databases of soldiers, cemeteries, and Medals of Honor awarded; an interactive time line of Civil War events, and a Twitter account featuring the daily accounts of a fictional Civil War newspaper reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/civilwar/soldiers-and-sailors-database.htm |title=Soldiers and Sailors Database - The Civil War (U.S. National Park Service) |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/civilwar/index.htm |title=The Civil War (U.S. National Park Service) |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2014-04-03 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NPS and local governments hoped that the sesquicentennial would increase visitation to Civil War battlefield site, and generate revenue. Spotsylvania County made about $68,000 off of the special events for the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], which it considered insufficient, considering the effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Branscome |first=Jeff |url=http://news.fredericksburg.com/newsdesk/2013/06/22/battles-anniversary-costly-for-spotsy |title=Battle's anniversary costly for Spotsy &amp;#124; The News Desk |publisher=News.fredericksburg.com |date=2013-06-22 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In honor of the 150th anniversary, the exhibits at the Chancellorsville Visitors Center got a $1.6 million upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schemmer |first=Clint |url=http://news.fredericksburg.com/newsdesk/2013/11/08/nps-exhibits-to-get-update-2 |title=NPS exhibits to get update &amp;#124; The News Desk |publisher=News.fredericksburg.com |date=2013-11-08 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Visitors Center was originally completed to coincide with both the 100th anniversary of the Civil War and the 50th anniversary of the birth of the National Park Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://npsfrsp.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/park-development-chancellorsville-battlefield-visitor-center-part-4|title=Park Development: Chancellorsville Battlefield Visitor Center, Part 4|work=Mysteries and Conundrums}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new exhibit will reflect current research and scholarship. The National Park Service intends to create a contemplative space focusing on the sacrifices of those that fought in the war.

Several park superintendents have been awarded the Appleman-Jude-Lewis Award for their efforts in commemorating the 150th anniversary of the American Civil War. Eight park service employees received the award, recognizing their work in "preserving the nation's cultural resources"&lt;ref&gt;Park Service Commended for 150th Civil War Anniversary Work&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Park Service's social media team was commended by a local newspaper for their photojournalism coverage of the Battle of Chancellorsville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.fredericksburg.com/pastisprologue/2013/05/05/photos-galore-of-chancellorsville-150th-in-fredericksburg-spotsylvania-nmp |title=NPS Rocks Photo Coverage of Battle of Chancellorsville 150th &amp;#124; Past Is Prologue |publisher=News.fredericksburg.com |date=2013-05-05 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reenactments===
{{further|Historical reenactment}}
Reenactments are a scripted form of educational or entertainment activity in which participants follow a prearranged plan to reconstruct aspects of an event or period which can include living histories, museum exhibits, plays, television, film, travelogues and historiographies.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew, Vanessa. "Introduction: What Is Reenactment?." Criticism. no. 3 (2004): 327. 10.1353/crt.2005.0001 (accessed December 1, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major re-enactment took place at the [[1913 Gettysburg reunion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/gett/getttour/sidebar/reunion13.htm |title=The Great Reunion of 1913 |accessdate=15 August 2008 |date=September 1998 |author=Heiser, John |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later at the Battle of Gettysburg 150th anniversary commemoration from June 28, 2013 to July 7, 2013 came the largest historical reenactment in the United States. There were approximately 12,000 re-enactors from around the world, over 200,000 spectators, 400 Gettysburg Anniversary Committee workers and nearly 500 reporters that attended the sesquicentennial.&lt;ref&gt;Gast, Phil. CNN.com, [http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/28/travel/gettysburg-anniversary "150th anniversary of Battle of Gettysburg provides a bigger story"]. Last modified June 30, 2013. Accessed December 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This 10-day event in a town of 7,800 people is thought to have brought in over $100 million in economic revenue.

Reenactments for the American Civil War Sesquicentennial are not that much different from reenactments that have taken place in previous years. Most state that they are doing something extra for the 150th anniversary by adding more special events, more re-enactors, or extending the days they are open.&lt;ref&gt;Olustee Battlefield Historic State Park, "Annual Reenactment of the Battle of Olustee or Ocean Pond," Schedule of Events,&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the fanfare of the 150th anniversary, many of the Sesquicentennial Reenactments are very similar in size and organization to the reenactments held in previous years. The American Civil War reenactments incorporate more than just tactical movements of the specific battle being portrayed. The reenactments taking place are part of a larger [[living history]] that is put forth to transport the general public back to the Civil War era. Re-enactors of all backgrounds take part in portraying battles, life in camp, and life as a woman at reenactment events. Most reenactments incorporate an opening ceremony, a ladies tea, Union and Confederate Camps to explore, period appropriate sutlers (vendors), field hospitals, bands, military and [[Cavalry]] drills, and the actual battle reenactment. Because the war spanned five years the 150th anniversary reenactments are spread out not only across the country but across time as well, taking place from 2011 through 2015.

====Location and funding====
Because "current NPS policy does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property," many reenactments take place on private lands such as Boy Scout campgrounds and privately run parks rather than Historic Battlegrounds.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/wicr/faqs.htm "Wilson's Creek National Battlefield", Frequently Asked Questions] (accessed November 29, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[National Park Service]] does make an exception regarding Gettysburg; most other sites for the Sesquicentennial are strictly living history sites. These living history sites still include re-enactors, just not full battle demonstrations.

Funding for the sesquicentennial reenactments comes from mainly private sources. Most are local communities starting organizations such as the Gettysburg Anniversary Committee (GAC) formed in 1995 specifically to "promote and host the annual reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg."&lt;ref&gt;Annual Gettysburg Civil War Battle Reenactment, [http://www.gettysburgreenactment.com/about-gac "The Battle of Gettysburg", About GAC] (accessed December 2, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Other, smaller reenactments are funded by corporate donations and local charities. For the Sesquicentennial these smaller events are hoping to raise more sponsors for the added traffic organizers are expecting.&lt;ref&gt;Brooksville Raid Reenactment Website, "Welcome to the Brooksville Raid," Brooksville Raid Reenactment Sponsors,&lt;/ref&gt;

====NPS versus reenactment groups====
The major clash between the NPS and local reenactment groups is the NPS policy prohibiting re-enactors from portraying opposing lines of battle as well as simulating casualties and deaths. The park service believes that the best way to honor those who died is to remember them in dedication ceremonies, not recreating their deaths. It cites safety as another main reason for leaving out reenactments, stating the black gunpowder used is volatile and can be dangerous to re-enactors as well as spectators.&lt;ref&gt;YouTube, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcnURKwilg "National Park Service Battle Reenactment Policy Video"], 4 min 29 sec (accessed December 2, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The NPS believes that the story of the American Civil War can be told accurately without the use of dangerous reenactments. Instead, the National Park Service leans heavily on re-enactors for living history events. The NPS is also conscious of the resources wasted in putting on full-scale reenactments.

Re-enactors, who are generally amateur history enthusiasts, understand the safety concerns regarding black powder at their events and feel they do a good job at keeping the public safe by using specific spectator areas. The fundamental issue for the re-enactors, especially for the 150th anniversary, is their belief that the best way to honor the fallen is by educating the public in the horrors that these men faced. In their view, the best way to do that is through battle reenactments and their attention to detail is a sign of respect for those who died.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/revwar/reenactors "Reenactors in the Parks: A Study of External Revolutionary War Reenactment Activity at National Parks"], Section 2: Values and Perceptions (accessed November 12, 2013). Mitch Smith, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-23/news/ct-met-dusable-colored-soldier-20130624_1_re-enactors-enactors-re-enactment "African-American re-enactors bring history to life"], ''Chicago Tribune'', June 23, 2013, (accessed December 6, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

====African American reenactors====
The involvement of Black troops during the war is undisputed, however their re-enactors have been missing from events such as battle reenactments, parades, and ceremonies since the first anniversary of the war. However, in the decades leading up to the sesquicentennial there has been an increasing amount of portrayal of what were called during the Civil War, "Colored Troops" in reenactments, representing soldiers for both the North and the South.&lt;ref&gt;Montee Fields-White, [http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2011/05/black_civil_war_reenactors_who_are_they.1.html "Black Civil War Re-Enactors Reclaim History"], The Root (accessed December 1, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; This surge of interest in the Civil War by the African-American community is partially attributed to the 1989 movie ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Macy L. Freeman, [http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/history/info-10-2011/civil-war-reenactor-bernard-george.1.html "Civil War Reenactor Keeps History of U.S. Colored Troops Alive"], AARP Bulletin (accessed December 3, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

As the number of African American re-enactors grows the number of educational events including them grow as well. For the 150th anniversary many events have been included to incorporate this new group of re-enactors, making the history more complete.&lt;ref&gt;Olustee Battlefield Historic State Park, [http://battleofolustee.org/forms_docs/2014_schedule.html "Annual Reenactment of the Battle of Olustee or Ocean Pond", How People of Color Served in the Civil War] (accessed December 2, 2013). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328142814/http://battleofolustee.org/forms_docs/2014_schedule.html |date=March 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many black regiments participated in 2011 kicking off the sesquicentennial. Their reasons for participation are just as varied and personal as their white counterparts.

The African American Civil War Memorial Freedom Foundation's charter organization is the Sons and Daughters of [[United States Colored Troops]] (USCT).&lt;ref&gt;Asa Gordon, [http://asagordon.byethost10.com/sdusct/events.htm "Sesquicentennial Civil War Commemorative Events, April 2011 through May 2015"], African American Civil War Memorial Freedom Foundation (Retrieved November 7, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sesquicentennial period of April 2011 through May 2015, this site lists reenactments that are occurring that may include members of the USCT re-enactors. Of these planned re-enactments are the May 22–25, 2014 Fight or Freedom at Eastern Virginia sites of [[Fort Pocahontas]] at Wilson's Wharf along the James River where in of May 24, 1864, 2500 Confederate troops attacked a contingent of 1400 USCT who more than ably held their own. The Confederates were repulsed once additional Union forces arrived with the Southern troops taking a 5:1 ratio casualty loss.
23rd Regiment [[United States Colored Troops]](USCT) are "the first colored soldiers to fight in combat against the Confederate army of Northern Virginia on May 15, 1864 during the battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/23rd-Regiment-United-states-colored-Troops/129425 23rd Regiment United States Colored Troops Facebook Page]. Retrieved October 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants and all interested parties of the history of this fighting group are invited to an organizational meeting of commemoration in January 2012. Finding a positive response, a nucleus of would be re-enactors begins meeting at John J. Wright Civil War Museum in Spotsylvania, Virginia. Monthly gatherings for history lectures on the USCT and the Civil War are often preludes to organizational plans for the formal Presentations of the Colors at historic gatherings, at Cemetery memorials and as a part of Living History Days wearing the full regalia of a 23rd Regiment USCT soldier, circa 1864. These meetings and photos of the public displays are catalogued on the 23rd Regiment Facebook page. Actual re-enactments are on May 19 and 20, 2012 for The Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse; on October 13, 2012 with an encampment at the [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park]], Virginia; on Memorial Day weekend in 2013 joining 3rd U.S. Regulars and the 13th Virginia Infantry as NPS honor guards at the Fredericksburg National Cemetery, Fredericksburg, Virginia.

====Women reenactors====
The idea of women re-enactors on the battlefield can be a touchy subject as not all women want to play the role of a nurse or local civilian; roles that are needed mainly for living history events. Women who want to play a combat roles (which was indeed played by a few women in disguise in the 1860s), find themselves up against history and the men who lead local Civil War Reenactment Regiments.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Freeman, [http://historicallyspeaking.driftingfocus.com/2012/11/10/calling-all-welcoming-reenacting-units "Calling All Welcoming Reenacting Units!"], Historically Speaking: The Life and Times of a Historical Reenactor, November 10, 2012 (accessed November 29, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The men who exclude women from their organizations cite historical accuracy as the main reason why women are excluded from their reenactments. However, Nina Brands argues that they are being more hypocritical than they realize. She says that re-enactors are much heavier than historic soldiers, but women are about the right size.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Brands, [http://www.talkingpost.org/historical-re-enactments "Historical Re-enactments"], Talking Post, June 12, 2012 (accessed December 1, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, the reenactment community is slowly beginning to open its ranks for female recruits in the sesquicentennial.

====Controversy====
Dual reenactments happened at both Antietam (2012) and Gettysburg (2013) to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War.  Dual reenactments tend to create divisions among the hobby's progressive, mainstream and farb re-enactors.&lt;ref name="eveningsun.com"&gt;Kessler, Brandie.

===Other commemoration===
Academic and independent institutions commemorate the Sesquicentennial of the American Civil War (ACW) in their own manner. Some host memorial gatherings on the grounds of former slave communities; others hold community action street festivals incorporating education, musical presentations and social action job fairs and health clinics while still others arrange lecture series blending issues of the ACW with contemporary racial concerns.

====Ken Burns' project====
Noted documentarian Ken Burns has been working on a project to commemorate the Gettysburg Address given by Abraham Lincoln four months after the battle at Gettysburg. Titled "The Address," this documentary is set to be released in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Ken, [https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-address/home/ "The Address"], PBS/WETA, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Burns has an online website,  "Learn the Address" that shows videos of noted individuals and ordinary folk alike reciting the Gettysburg Address.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Ken, [http://www.learntheaddress.org "Learn the Address"], WETA. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The site includes celebrities such as President Obama, former presidents George W.

====States====
Twenty-five States have formally established Sesquicentennial of the American Civil War committees, commissions or departments within each State that are then linked to the National Park Service website. Those States are: Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Regardless of configuration, they may involve both public and private funding partnerships. States with legislatively designated commissions are: Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Virginia. States whose commemoratives are directed by state heritage agencies or historical societies are: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The States that are relying on their own boards of tourism or economic development to present the Sesquicentennial story are: Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia. New York, South Carolina and Utah are drawing from many entities to manage their commemoratives. Central Connecticut State University handles their State's presentations while in Wisconsin the Department of Veterans Affairs manages theirs. The States of Kansas and West Virginia are using the Sesquicentennials of their own States as a co-celebration with the national Civil War commemoratives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/cwindepth/civilwar150-states.html "Civil War 150:State by State"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, NPS.GOV, National Park Service, The Department of the Interior.

=====Arkansas=====
The Shiloh Museum of Ozark History as well as the State's Department of Arkansas Heritage brings together a varied group of communicators, professors, historians and even young Arkansas students, selected for their own prize winning essays on the Sesquicentennial. The four- to five-minute audio presentations cover topics as expected of the "Confederate Women of Arkansas" and "Arkansas Battlefield Archeology." The podcasts are also varied with "Unionism in Arkansas," "Medicine in Trans-Mississippi" and "Bats and the Civil War."
One particularly egregious event is recounted in the podcast "Racial Atrocities during the Camden Expedition," the April 1864 engagement that commences as a forage for corn around Camden, Arkansas and ends in brutality against USCT.  While the 1st Kansas Expeditionary force is setting about their re-supplying, they encounter the 29th Texas Cavalry, who they previously defeat at the engagement at Honey Springs. Now, it is 5000 Confederate troops defeating the almost 1200 Federal troops, among them the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry, in what becomes a part of the larger Battle of Poison Springs, Arkansas legacy. Of the 310 Federal troops killed near Camden, 116 are members of the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry. Nine wounded USCT troops are later sought by roaming members of the 29th Texas Cavalry and shot to death while undergoing treatment at battlefield aid stations, presumably in retaliation for battlefield actions "by Negroes against our Confederate troops."  Podcast reader Mark K. Christ, a member of the Arkansas Preservation Board, comments: "This War became one of extermination."

=====Georgia=====
The State of Georgia's National Park Service (NPS) linked site offers a resource for examining and understanding the African American experience in the United States. The NPS selects "From the Civil War to Civil Rights" as the Sesquicentennial theme. The intent is to be more inclusive in nature than what has gone before in the Centennial period, when Jim Crow policies are still a factor in many Southern regions of the United States.
To discuss issues of "African Americans in the Civil War" this NPS section is further broken into segments of Ethnography, African Reflections on the American Landscape and one focus group research, done under the auspices of Georgia researchers. Entitled "African American Attitudes toward the Civil War: The War of Jubilee: Tell Our Stories and We Will Come," is a partnership of Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park (KEMO) and the Kennesaw State University Center for the Study of the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Hermina Glass-Avery, Leslie Harris, and Jyotsna Vanapalli, [http://www.nps.gov/cwindepth/africanamericans.htm "Assessing African American Attitudes towards the Civil War"], Center for the Study of the Civil War Era, Kennesaw State University for Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, National Park Service, 2010. Retrieved November 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Conducted in 2010, with the three goals of understanding the perspectives of the local African American community, inquiring how African Americans would like their history interpreted and finally, facilitating the incorporation of these desired interpretations into KEMO's presentations. Fifty-seven African American Participants with a history of involvement in heritage and/or preservation groups and also member participants with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) interact and discuss with the Facilitators. Questions are posed to get a sense of the Participants' attitudes about the Civil War and also about the displays presently offered at KEMO. The Participant's responses indicate that inclusive representation of the range of African American history remains doubtful. There persists the sense among Black citizens that the Southern White population is resistant to any change in the "Lost Cause" narrative and instead prefers and only supports the marginalization of African Americans by being represented as enslaved persons.
The men and women of the Participant group suggest changes in data collection from African American families and communities, preferring more personalized histories be found and represented when telling their history. Facilitators list the inclusion of the USCT history as well as the stories of the diversity of the African American lives and communities both before and after the Civil War is included in an updated KEMO interpretation. The Facilitators are also recommending that the histories of the local, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and religious communities that grew from the post-War, mid-19th century are represented and that the educational community will engage in these efforts.

=====New York=====
Hartwick College in Oneonto, New York hosts a "Sesquicentennial Celebration" concurrent with the academic year from 2011 through 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartwickcollege.edu/academics/special-opportunities/us-pluralism-programs/ "Diverse Voices and Faces of the Civil War, 2011–2012"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Civil War Sesquicentennial Commemoration, Hartwick College, 2013.

The intent of this symposium, among other things, is presumed to be inclusive of the African American experience, the institutional history of Hartwick College and the regional ties to the War.

=====South Carolina=====
In December 2010, the Secession Ball is held on the 20th of that month in Charleston, South Carolina drew protests from the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Behre, "[http://www.postandcourier.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?avis=CP&amp;date=20101203&amp;category NAACP to Protest Secession Event]", Post and Courier, December 3, 2010.

Beyond the confrontations, there is anticipation that this will also open the lines of communication between all parties and the hopes that the Commemorative period will represent all South Carolinians' perspectives of the Civil War.

=====Texas=====
As one of the activities for the State of Texas in this Sesquicentennial era, the city of Galveston has raised funds to erect a marker commemorating [[Juneteenth]]. This is significant as on June 19, 1865, Federal troops finally arrived in Galveston, Texas to declare that the Emancipation Proclamation has been signed two and one half years prior and that General Robert Lee has surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia on April 9 of that year. The War is over. A contraction of June 19 becomes Juneteenth, the designation of a day of joyous celebration that slavery is over and is annually commemorated. The Galveston Historical Society is also making available a seventy-two page pamphlet of African Americans in Texas: A Lasting Legacy Timeline that may be Downloaded at this site.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thc.state.tx.us/preserve/projects-and-programs/military-sites/texas-sesquicentennial-american-civil-war African Americans in Texas: A Lasting Legacy Timeline]", Galveston Historical Foundation, Galveston County Historical Commission, 2011, Retrieved June, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This pamphlet includes a multitude of historical sites related to African American history in the State of Texas including churches, school, museums and residential and community districts. Photographs and brief synopsis of the locales are provided.

=====Virginia=====

===Art===
Contemporary artists have found an opportunity to showcase their works in museums that are putting on exhibits for the Sesquicentennial. Artists like, [[Dale Gallon]], [[Mort Kuntsler]], and [[Don Troiani]] have commissioned pieces specifically for this anniversary as a way to capitalize on the revitalized popularity of the Civil War.
Well-renowned historical artist [[Dale Gallon]] has created 10 new oil paintings for the 150th Anniversary that are currently on display as reproduced murals at the Seminary Ridge Museum in Gettysburg. According to Gallon's website, "The museum will feature 20,000 square feet of interactive exhibit galleries and educational programming…"&lt;ref name="gallon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallon.com|title=The Official Dale Gallon Website|website=www.gallon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10 new pieces created by Gallon focus on 3 key themes that emphasize life during the Civil War; the first day of combat at the Battle of Gettysburg, hospitalization and treated the wounded, and the moral, spiritual, and civic debates that arose around the Civil War.&lt;ref name="gallon.com"/&gt; In a release from the museum the executive director, Barbara Franco, states that the Gallon exhibit, "… will help visitors make a connection to the events on Seminary Ridge and help them understand the voices of duty and devotion focused on [in the exhibit]."&lt;ref&gt;Neil, Dru Anne, Gettysburg Seminary Ridge Museum and Dale Gallon, renowned historical artist, partner to enhance museum exhibits, for the Seminary Ridge Museum: May 2nd, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit opened on July 1, 2013 on the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg and is now a permanent feature of the museum.
[[Mort Kuntsler]] recently finished an exhibit at the South Carolina State Museum entitled, For Us the Living, that ran until April 7, 2013. The show included, 30 paintings and sketches, which were "a highlight of more than 350 Civil War scenes Kuntsler has painted over the past 25 years."&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, Don, S.C. State Museum features paintings of famous Civil War artist, for The Rock Hill Herald: December 2nd, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After this show, Kuntsler only plans to paint 8 more Civil War themed pieces before retiring from this genre. This collection will be called, A Tribute to the Legend, and will feature, "historical locations, personalities, and events that are special to Kunstler."&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, Laura, Kuntsler Plans Series, for The Winchester Star: November 30th, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; For the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, Kuntsler partnered with America Remembers to produce the Mort Kuntsler Civil War Sesquicentennial Tribute Rifle. The tribute rifle, a Henry rifle, which was a reliable gun during the war, is attributed with Kuntsler artwork in 24-karat gold.&lt;ref&gt;Honoring the 150th Anniversary of the War Between the States with the Artwork of an American Master, for America Remembers: 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Don Troiani]] has created a number of commissioned works for the 150th anniversary of the Civil War. Most notably, one oil piece that depicts a pivotal moment of African-American involvement on the battlefront, when Sgt. Maj. Thomas R. Hawkins, First Sgt. Alexander Kelly, and Lt. Nathan Edgerton rush forward and recover the Union colors.&lt;ref&gt;Colimore, Edward, New Painting Honors Key Civil War Moment for African Americans for philly.com: June 20th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was revealed in June 2013 at the Union League of Philadelphia.

====Preservation====
The Gettysburg [[Cyclorama]] is one of the most important preservation projects brought on by the 150th Anniversary. This huge art piece is 377&amp;nbsp;ft. long, 42&amp;nbsp;ft. high, and weighs 12.5 tons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Gettysburg Cyclorama, for The National Park Service website: 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclorama was originally painted with oil on canvas by Paul Philippoteaux to commemorate the Battle of Gettysburg, and it was opened to the public at Chicago in 1883 with critical and popular acclaim. The enormity of the cyclorama surrounded audiences and transported them the height of the battle. After the popularity of cyclorama dwindled around the start of the 20th century with the popularity of motion pictures, it was taken down and stored in abysmal conditions until it was purchased, mended, and hung in 1913. The cyclorama was purchased by the National Park Service in the late 1940s and underwent its first major restoration in 1962, just before the Civil War Centennial. According to the National Park Service's website, the restoration required, "… hours of hand labor to repair water damaged portions of the painting and two large sections faded by years of direct sunlight."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For the 150th Anniversary of the Civil War, the cyclorama underwent a five-year restoration project that started in 2003 at a cost of $15 million.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Armas, Genaro C. and Livglio, Joann, Gettysburg Cyclorama allows new look at old work, for the Associated Press: June 27th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; For the restoration, "conservators separated the painting's 27 panels and cleaned each one inch by inch with cotton swabs, stabilized brittle areas and removed bad touchups and damaging glue."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The painting, for the first time in decades, has been hung correctly so that it bows inward and gives audiences the feeling of 3-dimensionality.

====Controversy====
When the cyclorama was restored in 1962 a new visitor's center was commissioned to house the piece. Created by well renowned architect, Richard Neutra. Neurta's design was a part of the National Park's Services' Mission 66, which sought to update "deteriorated and dangerous conditions in the national parks."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The visitor center he created was situated right on the battlefield. Through Mission 66, parks underwent modernization, and Neutra's design for the Gettysburg Visitor Center reflected that. "Critics claimed the new building represented the idealism that was a part of the modern movent of the 1960's."&lt;ref name="Jonie, Andrew Pete 1997"&gt;Jonie, Andrew Pete, Interpreting Landscape: Understanding Through a Story of Architectural Experience, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999, however, the building had become decrepit and the NPS planned its demolition to restore the sight lines of the battleground its original 1863 aesthetic.&lt;ref name="Jonie, Andrew Pete 1997"/&gt; This stirred a controversy amongst spectators, including Neutra's son, Dion Neutra, who believed the building itself was worthy of preservation and a part of the National Park Service's own history.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Stephanie, Protestors: Keep Cyclorama Building, for The Daily Record/ Sunday News: 02/25/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Neutra's building closed in 2005 and the Cyclorama painting was moved to its new museum and visitor center in 2007, and two years later, in 2009, during the midst of the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, Neutra's building was bulldozed. The new visitor center opened in 2008 and was designed by Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners to resemble a 19th-century farm.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, Mitchell, Richard Neutra's Gettysburg Cyclorama to be Demolished, for Architectural Digest: January 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music====
Many states involved with the sesquicentennial incorporated music festivals as a tribute. The Wisconsin band, dressed in both blue and gray uniforms, sounded trumpets to popular military tunes to commemorate the Battle of Chancellorsville. This band modeled itself, among those of other states, after the original bands to each respective area. Commemorators expressed how bands shaped the Civil War by soothing the men who had seen so much death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Meg |url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/band-to-play-at-civil-war-battles-sesquicentennial-7p9j93m-204207011.html |title=Band to play at Civil War battle's sesquicentennial |publisher=Jsonline.com |date=2013-04-22 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Frankfort, Kentucky contributed a celebration of the music of the Civil War era in a Cornets and Cannons Festival. This performance includes period instruments and will include some of the best and most experienced brass bands today re-creating the music of the Civil War era. Performers from around the country contributed to the overall performance from September 1 through September 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.com/news/recent-postings/150441-cornets-a-cannons-civil-war-sesquicentennial-music-festival.html |title=Cornets &amp; Cannons- Civil War Sesquicentennial Music Festival |publisher=Civilwar.com |date=2011-09-04 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Friends of Michigan History put on their third annual The Turning Point of the War, 1863 concert as a tribute to the Sesquicentennial. Both the male soldiers and the ladies of the band wear authentic Civil War outfits while 5th Michigan Regiment Band performed pre-1865 compositions on authentic brass instruments. Members of the band discussed their distress how too often historical events such as the sesquicentennial are completely lost in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statenews.com/article/2013/06/band-performs-in-honor-of-civil-war-anniversary |title=Band performs in honor of Civil War anniversary |publisher=The State News |date=2013-06-01 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to state bands, the sesquicentennial of the Civil war inspired popular band Civil War. Civil War posted a new music video for the track "Gettysburg" as a tribute to the anniversary on their latest album "The Killer Angels." The band commented on the released video as a contribution in respect for the one who lost their loves long ago on the battlefield of Gettysburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=95809|title=150th Anniversary Of "Gettysburg" Honored In New Civil War Video|publisher=Metal Underground}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theater====
Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia premiered Rappahannock County and the theatre musical Civil War Voices, based on period diaries and letters of the period. In addition, the Shenandoah Valley Wayside Theatre and The Whipping Man, originally produced by Manhattan Theatre Club added to theater contributions around the country. However, controversy over how un-popularized other productions in states who chose to not commemorate the sesquicentennial, such as Chicago, has led supporters of commemoration to speak out to their local government about funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCabe |first=Terry |url=http://citylitcivilwar.blogspot.com/2011/10/civil-war-plays-elsewhere-not-in.html |title=Civil War Sesquicentennial: Civil War plays elsewhere, not in Chicago |publisher=Citylitcivilwar.blogspot.com |date=2011-10-12 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to theater performances, Decatur, Alabama, The Princess Theatre Center for the Performing Arts commemorated with a lecture of stories of the era, book signing, and a concert "Songs and Stories of the Civil War".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/01/decaturs_princess_theatre_prog.html |title=Decatur's Princess Theatre programs to commemorate Civil War sesquicentennial |publisher=AL.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1891 Fredonia Opera House in New York gave nod to the anniversary with a one-man, multimedia production A Better Band Than Mine. This production, originally created in 2002, is based on the actual letters of Civil War Musician, J. Herbert George, 10th Vermont Infantry. Creator Thomas Loughlin created this play due to his love of history of the Civil War and combining his fascination of digital technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starnewsdaily.com/entertainment/theater/story/Opera-House-Celebrates-Civil-War-Sesquicentennial-with-Multimedia-Production-2011-07-08 |title=Entertainment Theater - Opera House Celebrates Civil War Sesquicentennial with Multimedia Production |publisher=StarNewsDaily.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital media===
Numerous document [[Digitizing|digitization]] projects, such as the Civil War 150 Legacy Project: Document Digitization and Access, have been produced through legislature created commissions, like the Virginia Sesquicentennial of the American Civil War Commission. The document digitization projects involve the digitization, or computer imaging, of privately owned Civil War documents, such as soldier diaries or letters. Through the digitization of these documents, easier access and search of relevant Civil War information is readily available to the public online. These commissions aim to give scholars and the public information about the social, religious and political beliefs of Civil War Era soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Drake Davis and Renee Savits, "Civil War 150 Legacy Project: Document Digitization and Access," Virginia Libraries 56, no. 4 (2010): 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mobile apps====
Various sesquicentennial apps for mobile devices have appeared, many of these applications free for use.  Many of the apps contain various educational and informational features such as GPS battleground locators and guides as well as interactive photographs and maps.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Rowland and Elizabeth Roland, " Sesquicentennial Apps," Civil War Times 52, no. 4 (2013): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Tennessee Civil War 150," is an app created by the state of Tennessee, which contains various educational features. These features include people, places, artifacts, events and a "nearby" feature, which uses GPS tracking to locate Civil War battlegrounds near your current location.&lt;ref&gt;Designsensory, Inc, "Nearby," Tennessee Civil War 150 App, (2013): 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Features such as its "artifacts" option on the homepage allows users to view photographs of various weapons and clothing items from the Civil War. Upon selecting a photo, a brief description of the item is displayed, educating users of its Civil War use as well as ownership history of the item.&lt;ref&gt;Designsensory, Inc, "Artifacts," Tennessee Civil War 150 App, (2013): Uniforms and Arms.&lt;/ref&gt;

====State tourism in digital media====
Digital media has played an important role in Civil War Sesquicentennial tourism. Various states' and battlefield use websites to promote the Civil War sites' activities that have sprouted as part of the sesquicentennial, efficiently and effectively. Organizations such as The Civil War Preservation Trust offer online features that create an itinerary of battlefields and their corresponding events. Through creating itineraries, guests are able to maximize their experience.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rettig, "Visit a Civil War Battlefield," U.S. News &amp; World Report 147, no. 11 (2010): 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; In line with Civil War Sesquicentennial events, hotels near these events have incorporated the sesquicentennial into their tourism efforts, offering various "Civil War Packages," which include hotel stays, Civil War lectures, art, and battlefield options as well as discounts for purchasing these online packages.&lt;ref&gt;"Historic Hotels of America Commemorates the Civil War Sesquicentennial with Website Enhancements" Historic Hotels of America, (2011): 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Virginia has invested in online sesquicentennial tourism promotions, offering an online trip planner, and promoting less conventional Civil War attractions, such as trail tours, which offer a different story than traditional Civil War events like traditional battle reenactments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginia.org/civilwarinvirginia/ "The Civil War in Virginia"], Virginia is for Lovers, accessed December 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Virginia State tourism website also offers its webpage in various languages, creating a larger audience for its tourism attempts.&lt;ref&gt;"Deals and Events" Virginia Capital Region USA, accessed December 8, 2013. http://kr.capitalregionusa.org/explore-region/virginia&lt;/ref&gt;

====Education====
Many states, particularly Southern states, created special educational repositories for teaching the American Civil War during the Sesquicentennial. Many states utilize various [[Digital Humanities]] projects, particularly the National Endowment for the Humanities EDSITEment project&lt;ref&gt;[http://edsitement.neh.gov%20 Humanities EDSITEment project]&lt;/ref&gt; The EDSITEment website provides ready-made lesson plans with guiding questions and significant primary sources to expand the curriculum. The inclusion of sourcework into online repositories can be used for gaining an understanding of the [[American Civil War]]. Other repositories used are listed below.

=====Education resources=====
Many digital educational resources for teachers have developed out of the sesquicentennial, including virtual reality games such as "ValleySim." This digital resource has been adopted by a number of schools, which allows users to virtually experience life of both Northern and Southern soldiers during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Robelen, "Primary Sources Breathe Life into Civil War; Teachers are Using Firsthand Materials and Technology to Bring Deeper Understanding of the Era," Education Week 30, no. 28 (2011): 1&lt;/ref&gt; Many states offer various educational resources for students and teachers on their Civil War Sesquicentennial websites, such as Pennsylvania on their page "Pennsylvania Civil War 150." Through their "Resources for Teachers" link, various resources are available, including interactive timelines and maps.&lt;ref&gt;"Pennsylvania Civil War 150" Pennsylvania Historic Society, accessed December 2, 2013. http://pacivilwar150.com/ExperiencetheCivilWar/Timeline&lt;/ref&gt;
Various institutions of higher education have also participated in sesquicentennial events. [[Longwood University]] has created a series of [[podcasts]]  entitled That a Nation Might Live to commemorate issues, people and events of the Civil War. The University has integrated this project into undergraduate programs, creating active engagement between students and the Civil War through its written research by undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;"Longwood University launches Civil War Sesquicentennial Podcast," Longwood University, November 1, 2010, http://www.longwood.edu/2010releases_29307.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a guide for middle school aged students that has resources geared specifically for them. The LibGuide&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraryschool.libguidescms.com/middleschoolcivilwar%20 LibGuide]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is part of a project to encourage middle school and high school students to utilize archival collections for their projects, and to assist in making learning history more enjoyable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libraryschool.libguidescms.com/middleschoolcivilwar |title=First Step – Middle School US Civil War Guide – LibGuides Sandbox for Library Schools at Springshare |publisher=Libraryschool.libguidescms.com |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|sentences need merging/tightening|date=April 2014}}

The Civil War Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/|title=Civil War Trust|work=civilwar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is dedicated to the preservation of American Civil War battlefields. For the sesquicentennial they have compiled a battle narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/teachers/lesson-plans |title=Civil War Lesson Plans |publisher=Civilwar.org |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gilder Lehrman Institute for American History is a non-profit digital history project for the nation's public school systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/|title=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|work=gilderlehrman.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide lesson plans but their focus is digitization of valuable primary sources for free viewing.

The Library of Congress published a website for general viewing to transmit an American narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/civil/jb_civil_subj.html|title=Civil War (1860–1865)|work=americaslibrary.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They offer small synopses of various important events before and during the war effort.

The Library of Congress has a memory site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html|title=American Memory from the Library of Congress|work=loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It provides a large database of primary sourcework for public school analysis.

The National Archives has created a mobile repository of Civil War information and artifacts that circulates to host museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/civil-war/|title=Discovering The Civil War|work=archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social media====
Commemoration for the Sesquicentennial of the American Civil War can be viewed through various social media sites like Instagram and Twitter through hashtags such as #CivilWar150, #CW150 and #CivilWar. The Sesquicentennial is the first anniversary of the American Civil War that has seen the use of social media technologies. This technology offers a unique insight of the public's perspective on the sesquicentennial by allowing each person the opportunity to voice his or her opinion in a free forum.

Typical users on these sites are photojournalists, bloggers and tourists visiting a wide selection of sesquicentennial events across multiple states. The photojournalists on average are above the age of 35 and tend to have a more serious opinion of the events. While many of the tourists appear to below the age of 25 and have a more lighthearted humorous view of the Civil War.

===Controversy===
The NPS asked President Obama to make some remarks at Gettysburg on the anniversary of Lincoln's speech.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "NPS: President May Attend Gettysburg Address Event," Yorkdispatch.com, October 24, 2013, www.yorkdispatch.com/breaking/ci_24380065/nps-president-may-attend-gettysburg-address-event.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Obama declined and assigned the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]], [[Sally Jewell]], the task of appearing at Gettysburg on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Obama Won't Attend Gettysburg Remembrance," MSN. October 31, 2013, news.msn.com/us/obama-wont-attend-gettysburg-address-remembrance.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, "Gettysburg NMP Law Enforcement Ranger Morgan Brooks" read a prepared statement written by Obama for the event; this letter also appears on the White House website.&lt;ref&gt;NPS, "The Gettysburg Address 150 Years Later," From the Fields of Gettysburg (blog), November 20, 2013, npsgnmp.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/the-gettysburg-address-150-years-later/&lt;/ref&gt;

;Retraction of Lincoln criticism and reactions:
The sesquicentennial of the Gettysburg Address also saw a regional paper called ''The Patriot-News'' retract a negative editorial it published on November 24, 1863 regarding "the silly remarks of the President." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pennlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2013/11/a_patriot-news_editorial_retraction_the_gettysburg_address.html "Retraction for Our 1863 Editorial Calling Gettysburg Address 'Silly Remarks'"], The Patriot-News (Harrisburg, PA), November 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This belated retraction was much discussed in the media, and even became fodder for a ''Saturday Night Live'' skit featuring the character "Jebidiah Atkinson," played by Taran Killam.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Rebecca, [http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/11/pennlive_retraction_of_1863_ge.html ''PennLive Retraction of 1863 Gettysburg Address Review Spoofed on Saturday Night Live''], The Patriot-News (Harrisburg, PA), November 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Killam, Taran, [http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/weekend-update-jebidiah-atkinson/n43348|Weekend Update, Television], Saturday Night Live, November 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; News publication ''The Week'' mocked the retraction and remarked that it "[wa]sn't the most consequential apology, nor the most belated." &lt;ref name="Weber 2013"&gt;Weber, Peter, [http://theweek.com/article/index/252934/a-150-year-late-gettysburg-address-retraction-and-5-other-ridiculously-belated-apologies "A 150-Year-Late Gettysburg Address Retraction and Five Other Ridiculously Belated Apologies"], ''The Week'', November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The article proceeded to list other belated apologies, including a June 18, 2009 U.S. Senate resolution passed to apologize for the institution of slavery and segregation.&lt;ref name="Weber 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111sconres26rfh/pdf/BILLS-111sconres26rfh.pdf ''Senate Congressional Resolution 26''] ([[PDF]]) (Government Printing Office, Washington D.C., VA, June 18, 2009), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Currency War of 2009–2011''' was an episode of [[competitive devaluation]] which became prominent in the financial press in September 2010.  Competitive devaluation involves states competing with each other to achieve a relatively low valuation for their own currency, so as to assist their domestic industry. With the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|financial crises of 2008]] the export sectors of many emerging economies have experienced declining orders, and from 2009 several states began or increased their levels of intervention to push down their currencies.

Both private sector analysts and politicians including [[Tim Geithner]] have suggested the phrase ''[[currency war]]'' overstates the extent of hostility, but the term has been widely used by the media since Brazil's finance ministers [[Guido Mantega]] September 2010 announcement that a "currency war" had broken out.

Other commentators including world statesmen such as [[Manmohan Singh]] and Guido Mantega suggested a ''currency war'' was indeed underway and that the leading participants are China and the US, though since 2009 many other states have been taking measures to either devalue or at least check the appreciation of their currencies. The US does not acknowledge that it is practicing competitive devaluation and its official policy is to let the dollar [[Floating exchange rate|float freely]]. While the US has taken no direct action to devalue its currency, there is close to universal consensus among analysts that its [[quantitative easing]] programmes exert downwards pressure on the dollar.

According to many analysts the currency war had largely fizzled out by mid-2011, though others including Mantega disagreed. As of March 2012, outbreaks of rhetoric were still occurring, with additional measures being adopted by countries like Brazil to control the appreciation of their currency. Yet by June, there were signs that currency misalignment had been levelling out in China and across the world, with even Mantega relaxing some of Brazils anti-appreciation controls. Alarms were raised concerning a possible second 21st currency war in January 2013, this time with the most apparent tension being between Japan and the Euro-zone.

==Competitive devaluation in 2009==
Following the financial crisis of 2008 widespread concern arose among advanced economies concerning the size of their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing [[export-oriented industrialization|export-led growth]] as their ideal strategy. In March 2009, even before international cooperation reached its peak with the [[2009 G-20 London Summit]] Economist [[Edwin M. Truman|Ted Truman]] became one of the first to warn of the dangers of competitive devaluation breaking out. He also coined the phrase ''competitive non-appreciation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2010|loc= p. 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In September, senior policy makers such as [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) Managing Director [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] and US Treasury Secretary [[Tim Geithner]] were reported as saying the chances of a genuine currency war breaking out were low; however by early October, Strauss-Kahn was warning that the risk of a currency war was real. He also suggested the IMF could help resolve the trade imbalances which could be the underlying [[casus belli]] for conflicts over currency valuations. Mr Strauss-Kahn said that using currencies as weapons "is not a solution [and] it can even lead to a very bad situation. There’s no domestic solution to a global problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Daniel Tenengauzer, the head of emerging-market currency and rates strategy at [[Merrill Lynch]], suggested talk of a currency war can be seen as "political posturing", noting that emerging economies had been intervening on a wider scale back in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Considerable attention had been focused on China. For much of 2009 and 2010, China has been under pressure from the US to allow the yuan to appreciate. Between June and October 2010, China allowed a 2% appreciation of the yuan, but there are concerns from Western observers that China only relaxes her intervention when under heavy pressure. The fixed peg was not abandoned until just before the June G20 meeting, after which the yuan appreciated by about 1%, only to slowly devalue again until further US pressure in September when the yuan again began relatively steep appreciation, with the imminent September US Congressional hearings to discuss measures to force a revaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

Leading financial journalist [[Martin Wolf]] has suggested there may be advantages in western economies taking a more confrontational approach against China, which in recent years has been by far the biggest practitioner of competitive devaluation. Though he suggests that rather than using protectionist measures that may spark a trade war, a better tactic would be to use targeted [[capital control]]s against China to prevent them buying foreign assets in order to further  devalue the yuan, as previously suggested by [[Centre for European Policy Studies]] director [[Daniel Gros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Competitive devaluation in 2010==

===Negotiations at the 2010 annual IMF meeting===
In the middle of October 2010, finance ministers congregated in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group|2010 annual IMF and World Bank meeting]], which was expected to be dominated by talk of currency war. Just prior to the IMF meeting, the  [[Institute of International Finance]] had called for leading countries to agree on a currency pact to aid the [[Balance of payments#Imbalances|rebalancing]] of the world economy and to avert the threat of competitive devaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The meeting was held amid warnings that weaker exchange rates risk hurting the global economy, which was already vulnerable due to the [[Late-2000s recession|Global financial crisis]]. There was concern about  tit-for-tat [[protectionism]] at a time when the rate of increase in global growth was already slowing.

Canadian Finance Minister [[Jim Flaherty]] said "This is a crucial time that we need to address the commitment of our leaders to free trade, that we avoid protectionist measures." His US counterpart Timothy Geithner added that "global rebalancing is not progressing as well as needed to avoid threats to the global economic recovery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Various international finance ministers said the IMF should help abating the possibility of a currency war by encouraging initiatives to expand national economies without hurting that of other countries. The IMF, in turn, urged most developed countries to boost exports, and for some emerging markets to enhance domestic consumption and to let their currencies appreciate. Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the IMF would highlight the linkages between economies as part of a "systemic stability initiative". Its steering committee added that it should work on capital flows, exchange rate movements and the accumulation of capital reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Strauss-Kahn also said "There is clearly the idea beginning to circulate that currencies can be used as a policy weapon...Translated into action, such an idea would represent a very serious risk to the global recovery...Any such approach would have a negative and very damaging longer-run impact."&lt;ref name="carib"&gt;{{Cite news

Australia's Federal Treasurer, [[Wayne Swan]] played down rumours of a currency war saying global financial ministers were working in a coordinated way to deal with "exchange rate reform". However, the opposition's finance minister, [[Andrew Robb]], warned that with some countries deliberately devaluing their currencies other countries may retaliate thus causing a "trade war", and he urged Swann to alert "all of these other major countries to the very damaging implications of a currency war".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

During the IMF meeting there was disagreement based on conflicting views about how to sustain a recovery from the global recession. Countries led by the United States preferred flexible exchange rates, while others, led by China, resisted calls to appreciate their currency.

In an article published after the IMF meeting the ''Financial Times'' reported there was little sign of fruitful co-operation, with China blaming America for causing problems to emerging markets with excessive quantitative easing, while America repeated its calls for further appreciation of the yuan. According to Cornell University's [[Eswar Prasad]]: "China's aggressive pushback against criticism of its currency policy by shifting the line of attack towards loose monetary policies and rising public debt in advanced economies reflects its growing assertiveness and strong resistance to international pressure."&lt;ref name = "battleLines"&gt;{{Cite web

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported the "battle lines were drawn" as China accused the US of destabilising emerging economies with a "ultra-loose monetary policy", and the US wanted the IMF to intensify focus on both the exchange rates and the reserve accumulation of China.&lt;ref name = "battleLines"/&gt;
''[[Reuters]]'' suggested a currency war is already underway, with both China and the United States "winning the race" to devalue their currencies while pushing up the value of the Euro, the Yen and the currencies of many emerging economies. However, it added that with increasing rhetoric everyone will lose out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

A contrasting view was published on 19 October, with a paper from Chinese economist Yiping Huang arguing that the US did not win the last "currency war" with Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Huang classes the conflicting opinions over the relative valuations of the US dollar and Japanese yen in the 1980s as a currency war, though the label was not widely used for that period.&lt;/ref&gt; and has even less of a chance against China; but should focus instead on broader "structural adjustments" at the November [[2010 G-20 Seoul summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

{{Main article|2010 G-20 Seoul summit}}
Discussion over currency war and imbalances dominated the G20 summit. Attending leaders such as Britain's [[David Cameron]] made statements suggesting good progress had been made. Yet according to most commentators no substantial agreement was reached, with the US largely unable to persuade other nations to endorse the measures it considers necessary to rebalance the global economy.  IMF managing director [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] said this particular summit was "more of a G20 debate than a G20 conclusion".&lt;ref name = "shuns"&gt;{{Cite web

By December 2010, currency war was less of a hot topic and wasn't even on the agenda for the bilateral trade talks held between China and the US, but the issues still remain unresolved, with many emerging economies considering increased use of capital controls to cope with potentially de-stabilising capital inflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

By February, the US had stepped up diplomatic efforts to persuade emerging economies such as Brazil and India that China's intervention was the root cause of the currency war. However the US once again refrained from labelling China a currency manipulator. A Treasury report said that allowing for their high inflation, China was on track for an annual appreciation of 10% since they relaxed their currency peg back in June 2010. However treasury officials also suggested that this rate of appreciation is still insufficient either for the interests of the US, the wider global economy or even China itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

February saw the US dollar fall to its lowest level since 1973, based on comparison against a weighted basket composed of the currencies of its major trading partners and analysts began to converge on the view that the Feds QE2 program would begin to wind up by the middle of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Although Brazil is one of the emerging countries that has recently abandoned intervening against appreciation, her finance minister Guido Mantega disagreed with suggestions that the 'currency war' is over, saying it is still on-going.

Unlike other emerging economies, China has so far chose to continue holding its currency down against the dollar, fighting inflation instead with interest rate rises.&lt;ref&gt;Though China had allowed a small appreciation of about 1% between Jan and April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The rate rises cause even greater pressure from the markets for a currency appreciation, and to prevent this, at least in the months leading up to early 2011, China had to buy dollar assets at a faster rate than ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Global perspectives==

===Developed economies===

[[File:Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building.jpg|thumb|[[Quantitative easing]] programmes were deployed by the Federal Reserve from 2009 to stimulate investment and economic growth within the US. As a side effect, they contribute to capital flowing into emerging countries, pushing up the value of their currencies. ]]

====Anglosphere====
The US, and to a lesser extent the UK, share a position where they have independent currencies in addition to twin deficits – both large current account deficits and large fiscal deficits.  Though austerity programmes can address their fiscal deficits, the effect of these can only be to move debt from the public to private sector, unless the countries begin earning more than they spend – in other words their overall debt can only be paid off by going into current account surplus.&lt;ref&gt;Though if high  growth or inflation was an option that would  reduce the burden of the debt.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lowering their exchange rates, especially against the yuan,  is considered by government officials and by most economists as an important part of their approach to transition towards current account surpluses.&lt;ref name="Head2Head"&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The UK and US have not directly intervened to devalue their currencies, however their QE programmes have exerted downwards exchange rate pressure. In October 2010 analysts were expecting the UK and US to employ additional QE.&lt;ref name = "QE round2" &gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
After Japan's intervention in the week of 5 October, there was speculation that the US [[Federal Reserve]] would also intervene to inject more money into the economy via another round of QE (QE2), hence for a short time after the dollar depreciated slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that while countries which have trade surpluses with the United States were  trying to devalue or prevent appreciation of their currencies— including China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, and  Switzerland —the US was starting to retaliate with measures such  as the [[Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act 2010|Reform for Fair Trade Act]]. It then said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The atomic bomb, of course, is quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. America has in effect issued an ultimatum to China and G20: either you stop this predatory behaviour and agree to some formula for global rebalancing, or we will deploy QE2 `a l’outrance’ to flood your economies with excess liquidity. We will cause you to overheat and drive up your wage costs. We will impose a de facto currency revaluation by more brutal and disruptive means, and there is little you can do to stop it. Pick your poison.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Telegraph'' went on to say, however, that while a second round of [[quantitative easing]] may be required at a later date, there would soon be a "dangerous moment" that could backfire against the US with a weak dollar. It cited a "rush into oil and resources" and a consequent risk that a "commodity shock" could occur before a new [[Fiscal policy|stimulus]]. Thus, "US risks gambling away the 'exorbitant privilege' it has enjoyed for two-thirds of a century as currency hegemon."&lt;ref name = "necessary"&gt;{{Cite news

By mid October 2010, the dollar had dropped 7% since a 27 August speech by Federal Reserve Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] in which he said there was a possibility of further easing monetary policy. On 18 October, US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner stated "It is very important for people to understand that the United States of America and no country around the world can devalue its way to prosperity and competitiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Following this statement the value of the dollar rose as speculators calculated that at least in the short term it would be less likely for the US to intentionally devalue its currency.

In late October the US unveiled a suggestion to address the broader issues relating to trade imbalances by introducing indicative guidelines that for most countries would target a maximum current account surplus of 4% of GDP. While the plan attracted immediate opposition, the general notion of limiting excessive surpluses achieved cautious support at the October meeting of G20 finance ministers, including from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Australia, Canada and New Zealand all appear to have refrained from intervening against their currencies or from imposing new capital controls and have each seen substantial appreciation of their currencies in 2010. However both Australia and Canada have strong economies and are rich in natural resources.   According to [[Moody's]], negative effects from New Zealand's appreciation is offset by the fact that her currency has depreciated with respect to Australia, her biggest customer.&lt;ref name ="Feb11USTreport"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

====Eurozone====
The Eurozone is a special case where some members, principally Germany, enjoy a large current account surplus and so could accept or even benefit from currency appreciation.  Other countries though such as Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have twin deficits and so to a large extent would benefit from a depreciation.  While the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) did practice some QE in 2009, this was to a much lower extent than the US or UK, and they did not deploy a second round. The value of the Euro has been effectively left to float, and in fact early in 2010 central authorities intervened to defend the Euro’s value against the market. Following the generally positive results from bank stress testing that were released in summer,  market participants stopped speculating against the Euro, and the currency has tended to rise as a result of other countries practicing competitive devaluation. A major driver for the rise in the Euro in the latter half of 2010 was China's purchase of Euro-denominated bonds. While China's intervention was in some ways helpful for the Eurozone, it also generated concern with several European officials speaking out against the action. These officials included:  ECB governor [[Jean-Claude Trichet]] and [[Eurogroup]] president [[Jean-Claude Juncker]].&lt;ref name="Head2Head"/&gt;

====Japan====
Japan also has a large current account surplus, and in 2009 and 2010 the country allowed the Yen to appreciate. However, in September 2010 Japan twice intervened to effect a devaluation. Japan has a number of challenges that limit its ability to allow ongoing currency appreciation, including an aging population, high government debt (though not net debt as it has high private savings)  and vulnerability to deflation. The September devaluation did not draw widespread international condemnation.&lt;ref name="new age"/&gt; Within a couple of weeks upwards pressure on the [[Yen]] from the markets had almost entirely undone the effect of the intervention. However shortly after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|March 2011 earthquake]], other G7 nations joined Japan  in a rare act of solidarity, selling billions of Yen to help Japan devalue its currency against pressure from speculators who were betting on a further appreciation, as insurance firms recalled funds from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:People's Bank of China.jpg|thumb|As China’s exporters were hit by the global recession in 2008, the [[People's Bank of China]] began stepping up her intervention programme to prevent appreciation of the Yuan.

China has indicated she plans to further rebalance her economy towards domestic consumption, and intends to stop buying dollar assets by 2016.]]

====BRIC====
Speaking in October 2010, Russian Finance Minister [[Alexei Kudrin]] said it was too early too make "a decision regarding currency exchange rates. Such measures aren’t yet sufficiently formulated." He also stated other [[BRIC]] countries support Russia in opposing any US push to limit the ability of governments to control their currencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

China has a large current account surplus and huge foreign reserves along with the potential to transition towards domestic demand-led growth, allowing it to appreciate the yuan and reduce the current account surplus while still maintaining high GDP growth and decreasing unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

However, its economy has long been geared towards export-led growth, and hence a substantial appreciation could cause a sharp rise in unemployment, as China's premier warned in early October 2010.&lt;ref name="disaster"/&gt;  Economic commentators such as Martin Wolf have speculated that China is wary of complying with pressure to allow a substantial currency appreciation as she considers the long period of stagnation Japan experienced after the ''Plaza accord'' as in part resulting from Japan allowing a substantial appreciation of her currency against the dollar.&lt;ref name = "new age"/&gt;

Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]] has stated that reforms to re-balance the Chinese economy away from its current dependency on exports are well underway and that the yuan is being allowed to gradually appreciate. He warned that if China is forced to revalue its currency too fast that it would lead to social unrest in China, bankruptcy for export dependent companies and  "disaster for the world".&lt;ref name="disaster"&gt;{{Cite web

In reaction, Geithner suggested China’s attempts at limiting gains were the reason for capital controls and currency-market interventions in other emerging economies. "What’s happening is, as China holds its currency down, their currencies are moving up and they’re having to work very hard to make sure they’re not at an unfair disadvantage with China." ''Bloomberg'' pointed out at that countries such as Brazil, South Korea and Thailand sold their respective currencies in the weeks preceding the report to curb gains and support export. South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, Colombia and Russia were also tightening rules to limit capital flows and avoid swings in their currencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

====Latin America====
Brazil is a large economy which has generally allowed their currency to float freely, with the exception of some low level interventions to counter large capital inflows resulting from major stock sales. As a result, since early 2009 her currency has risen substantially against the dollar, with Goldman Sachs saying the [[Brazilian real|real]] is the most over valued currency in the world.&lt;ref name = "Brazil"/&gt; In October 2010, Brazil began increasing her capital controls, doubling a tax on foreign purchases of [[fixed-income]] assets to 4 percent so as to curb the real's appreciation to a two-year.  On 18 October, Brazil sought to curb the real's gains by raising taxed capital inflow on fixed-income assets by 2% to 6% and taxed inflows for [[Margin (finance)|margin]] deposits on [[Futures contract|futures]] to 6% from 0.38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Chile said it would implement capital controls to curb gains in the [[Chilean peso]], which had strengthened the most in the region in the middle of 2010, citing Chile's mixed in the 1990s. Finance Minister [[Felipe Larrain]] suggested that less public spending is "one of the best ways" to prevent appreciation and that "short-term capital I don’t want, so they disguise it as long-term capital and they are really playing with the [[interest rate]] differential."

Colombia and Costa Rica also initiated programmes to buy dollars to check their currency gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Asian economies====
In Oct 2010, Thai Finance Minister [[Korn Chatikavanij]] said his country faces a "challenge" as the appreciation of the [[baht]] was making Thai exports less competitive, and thus he needed to try to reduce volatility in the currency but "a country like ours can[not] forcibly change the fundamental direction of our currency." Over the first nine months of 2010 the baht had risen in value by 11 percent, the second largest appreciation of Asia's 11 most heavily traded currencies. There were also concerns that exports may slow: sales to foreigners make up almost two-thirds of Thai's economic activity. Prime Minister [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] also said Thailand may step up efforts to prevent currency appreciation from hurting its exporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Others===

Africa was hit harder by the global financial crises than other emerging regions. African countries may not however be as adversely affected by a currency war, as one of the regions problems is the collapse of foreign investment following the crisis, so increased international investment resulting from QE2 may actually help Africa rather than excessively drive up its currencies as is feared for other emerging regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2010|loc= pp. 197-208, 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However South African Finance Minister [[Pravin Gordhan]] has warned that ''currency wars'' could lead to "trade wars" if allowed to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The threat of a currency war would adversely affect the [[Caricom]] community because the various currencies are either tied to or float against the US dollar. Export and tourism earnings are closely linked to the US or Europe, thus there is a strong dependency on the said regions unlike Latin America which has diversified its markets in the previous decade.&lt;ref name="carib"/&gt;

==Competitive devaluation in 2012==
Early figures for February 2012 suggested that China had experienced a monthly trade deficit of $31.5bn, her largest for almost 15 years. By March this had prompted several Chinese officials to suggest the time was approaching for them to halt the appreciation of the Renimbi, with several independent analysts agreeing this would be reasonable. However China still has a substantial bi-lateral trade surplus with the US, and Financial Times journalists have suggested that if China returned to a fixed peg against the dollar this could re-ignite the Currency War, especially if the move coincided with the US presidential election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In June 2012, the ''Financial Times'' reported that while international trade remained a source of contention, concerns over currency war had receded, along with signs that major currencies such as the Renminbi  were now much less undervalued than they had been a year previously.  Brazil currency had fallen substantially from its peak value against the dollar, allowing Mantega to begin rolling back anti-appreciation measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
In July, the IMF downgraded its assessment of the degree to which the Renminbi is undervalued from "substantially" to "moderately".  However, Chinese officials were not pleased, suggesting that their exchange rate is no longer undervalued at all. Whereas in the US, presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]] retains his pledge to brand China as a currency manipulator from his first day of office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, Alan Beatie and Alice Ross for the ''Financial Times'' noted that the global trade imbalances which had driven the currency war have been sharply reduced. However, they suggest that without further reforms, the imbalances may soon widen again. They also note that Mantega once more raised the alarm about competitive devaluation, following the United States's launch of [[Quantitative easing#QE1, QE2, and QE3|QE3]] in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Competitive devaluation in 2013==
In mid January 2013, Japan's central bank signaled the intention to launch an open ended bond buying programme which would likely devalue the yen. This resulted in numerous senior central bankers and finance ministers warning of a possible fresh round of currency war. First to raise the alarm was Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy chairman at Russia's central bank. He was later joined by many others including [[Bahk Jae-wan]], the finance minister for South Korea, and by [[Jens Weidmann]], president of the [[Bundesbank]]. Weidmann held the view that interventions during the 2009-11 period were not intense enough to count as competitive devaluation, but that a genuine currency war is now a real possibility. Japan's economy minister [[Akira Amari]] has said that the Bank of Japan's bond buying programme is intended to combat deflation, and not to weaken the yen. Most commentators have asserted that if a new round of competitive devaluation occurs it would be harmful for the global economy.  However some analysts have stated that Japan's planned actions could be in the long term interests of the rest of the world; just as he did for the 2010-11 incident,  economist Barry Eichengreen has suggested that even if many other countries start intervening against their currencies it could boost growth worldwide, as the effects would be similar to semi-coordinated global monetary expansion. Other analysts have expressed skepticism about the risk of a war breaking out, with [[Marc Chandler]], chief currency strategist at [[Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.|Brown Brothers Harriman]], advising that: "A real currency war remains a remote possibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3301">In [[paleontology]], an '''Elvis taxon''' (plural ''Elvis taxa'') is a [[taxon]] that has been misidentified as having re-emerged in the [[fossil record]] after a period of presumed [[extinction]], but is not actually a descendant of the original taxon, instead having developed a similar morphology by [[convergent evolution]]. This implies that the extinction of the original taxon is real, and one taxon containing specimens from before and after the extinction would be [[polyphyletic]].

== Etymology ==
The term '''Elvis taxon''' was coined by D. H. Erwin and M. L. Droser in a 1993 paper to distinguish descendant from non-descendant taxa:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1= Benton|first1= Michael J. |authorlink1= Michael Benton|year= 2009|title= Introduction to paleobiology and the fossil record| last2= Harper|first2= David A.T.|authorlink2 = David Harper (palaeontologist)| publisher= [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn= 978-1-4051-8646-9|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=F_tYJ6wlYmYC&amp;pg=PA77|page= 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rather than continue the biblical tradition favored by Jablonski (for [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]]), we prefer a more topical approach and suggest that such taxa should be known as Elvis taxa, in recognition of the many [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] [[Elvis impersonator|impersonators]] who have appeared since the death of The King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erwin |first=D. H. |last2=Droser |first2=M. L. |year=1993 |title=Elvis taxa |journal=Palaios |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=623–624 |doi=10.2307/3515039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Related but distinctive concepts ==
By contrast, a [[Lazarus taxon]] is one that really is a descendant of the original taxon, and highlights [[transitional fossil]] records, which might be found later.

A [[zombie taxon]] has been considered a [[Lazarus taxon]] because it has been collected from younger strata, but it later turns out to be a fossil that was freed from the original seam and was refossilized in a sediment of a younger age. An example is a [[trilobite]] that gets eroded out of its [[Cambrian]]-aged limestone matrix and [[reworked fossil|reworked]] into [[Miocene]]-aged siltstone.

== Example ==
''Rhaetina gregaria'', one of the most common Late Triassic [[brachiopod]] species, has been regarded as a survivor that ranges across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary into the Early Jurassic. The external morphology of specimens from before and after the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]] were initially thought to be identical. Study of the internal features of the early [[Jurassic]] material showed that it was actually quite distinct from the [[Triassic]] specimens, and should be assigned to the genus ''Lobothyris'' as ''L. subgregaria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author= Alfréd Dulai |author2= József Pálfy |last-author-amp= yes|year= 2003 |conference= 3rd Workshop of the IGCP Project 458: "Triassic/Jurassic Boundary Changes", Stará Lesná, Slovakia

[[File:Concertgebouw.jpg|200 px|thumb|left|Concertgebouw, Amsterdam. Venue of the Eurovision Young Musicians 1988.]]
The Concertgebouw (also known as the ''"Royal Concertgebouw"'') a concert hall in Amsterdam, Netherlands, was the host venue for the 1988 edition of the Eurovision Young Musicians.&lt;ref name=Show/&gt;

The Dutch term "concertgebouw" literally translates into English as "concert building". On 11 April 2013, on occasion of the building's 125th anniversary, [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] bestowed the Royal Title "[[Koninklijk]]" upon the building, as she did previously on to the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Koninklijke status voor Het Concertgebouw|url=http://www.concertgebouw.nl/nieuws/koninklijke-status-voor-het-concertgebouw|publisher=Concertgebouw NV|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its highly regarded [[Architectural acoustics|acoustics]], the Concertgebouw is considered one of the finest [[concert hall]]s in the world, along with places such as Boston's [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2012/04/april-11-1888-concertgebouw-home-of-nearly-perfect-acoustics-opens/ April 11, 1888: Concertgebouw, Home of Nearly Perfect Acoustics, Opens]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.W.

==Overview of coverage==
One pan-European newspaper, ''[[The Local]]'', described the proliferation of fake news as a form of [[psychological warfare]].&lt;ref name=concernoverbarrage /&gt; Some media analysts have seen it as a threat to democracy.&lt;ref name=merkelwarns /&gt; In 2016, the European Parliament's [[European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]] passed a resolution warning that the [[Russian government]] was using "pseudo-news agencies" and [[Internet troll]]s as disinformation propaganda to weaken confidence in democratic values.&lt;ref name=divideeurope /&gt;

[[File:70news fake news headline.png|thumb|300px|Screenshot of a fake news story, falsely stating [[Donald Trump]] [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|won the popular vote]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. election]]&lt;ref name=wapo14november2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=politifact14november2016 /&gt;|alt=A screenshot of a fake news story, falsely claiming Donald Trump won the popular vote in the 2016 United States presidential election]]
In 2015, the [[Swedish Security Service]], Sweden's national security agency, issued a report concluding Russia was using fake news to inflame "splits in society" through the proliferation of propaganda.&lt;ref name=concernoverbarrage /&gt; Sweden's [[Ministry of Defence (Sweden)|Ministry of Defence]] tasked its [[Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency|Civil Contingencies Agency]] with combating fake news from Russia.&lt;ref name=concernoverbarrage /&gt; Fraudulent news affected politics in Indonesia and the Philippines, where there was simultaneously widespread usage of social media and limited resources to check the veracity of political claims.&lt;ref name="MozurScott"/&gt; German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] warned of the societal impact of "fake sites, bots, trolls".&lt;ref name=merkelwarns /&gt;

Fraudulent articles spread through social media during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]],&lt;ref name=pbsrussianpropaganda/&gt;&lt;ref name=afprussianpropaganda/&gt; and several officials within the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] said that Russia was engaged in spreading fake news.&lt;ref name=watkins /&gt; [[Computer security]] company [[FireEye]] concluded that Russia used social media to spread fake news stories&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.univision.com/noticias/america-latina/el-millonario-negocio-detras-de-los-sitios-de-fake-news-en-mexico |title=Millonario negocio FAKE NEWS |author=Carlos Merlo |journal=Univision Noticias |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as part of a [[cyberwarfare]] campaign.&lt;ref name=strohm /&gt; Google and [[Facebook]] banned fake sites from using [[online advertising]].&lt;ref name=belfast /&gt;&lt;ref name=shanika /&gt; Facebook launched a partnership with [[fact-checking websites]] to flag fraudulent news and hoaxes; debunking organizations that joined the initiative included: [[Snopes.com]], [[FactCheck.org]], and [[PolitiFact]].&lt;ref name=facebookisturning /&gt; U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] said a disregard for facts created a "dust cloud of nonsense".&lt;ref name=zuckerbergsays /&gt; [[Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) [[Alex Younger]] called fake news propaganda online dangerous for democratic nations.&lt;ref name=mi6 /&gt;

'''Giants of Rock''' was an annual [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] festival in [[Hämeenlinna]], [[Finland]]. It was held from 1987 to 1992 at [[Ahvenisto Race Circuit]]. The 1992 festival caused financial losses for organizers due to cancellations of some headlining acts. The last festival was arranged in 1994 as ''Power of Rock''.

In 1988 [[Motörhead]] recorded their performance. It was later released as the band's second live album [[Nö Sleep at All]].

'''HeliRussia''' is Russia's first International exhibition of [[Helicopter]] Industry held in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] at [[Crocus City Mall#Crocus Expo|Crocus Expo]] exhibition center. The first show, '''HeliRussia 2008''', was held on May 15–17 2008.

The world achievements in helicopter industry were demonstrated in all aspects, from design to manufacture and operation, on 10 thousand square meter area of the exhibition pavilions and open platforms. Prominent Russian companies like the [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant]], [[Kamov]], [[Kazan Helicopter Plant]], Rostvertol, RET Krondshtadt,  as well as representative offices of [[Eurocopter]], [[Bell Helicopter Textron]] and other companies participated in HeliRussia 2008.

HeliRussia is an important event in Russian business. The ongoing economic boom in Russia and the growth in paying capacity of the Russian organizations and individuals provide for the steady growth in demand for helicopter-related services.

The exhibition was held by the Russian Helicopter Industry Association with the support of the RF Federal Industrial Agency, the  United Industrial Corporation [[Oboronprom]] and OJSC Helicopters of Russia.

'''Holy Week in Mexico''' is an important religious observance as well as important vacation period. It is preceded by several observances such as [[Lent]] and [[Carnival in Mexico|Carnival]], as well as an observance of a day dedicated to the [[Our Lady of Sorrows|Virgin of the Sorrows]], as well as a [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] marking the abandonment of Jesus by the disciples. Holy Week proper begins on [[Palm Sunday]], with the palms used on this day often woven into intricate designs. In many places processions, masses and other observances can happen all week, but are most common on {{Tooltip|[[Maundy Thursday]]|Holy Thursday}}, [[Good Friday]], [[Holy Saturday]] and [[Easter Sunday]], with just about every community marking the crucifixion of Jesus in some way on Good Friday. Holy Saturday is marked by the [[Burning of Judas]], especially in the center and south of the country, with Easter Sunday usually marked by a mass as well as the ringing of church bells. Mexico’s Holy Week traditions are mostly based on those from Spain, brought over with the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], but observances have developed variations in different parts of the country due to the evangelization process in the colonial period and indigenous influences. Several locations have notable observances related to Holy Week including [[Passion Play of Iztapalapa|Iztapalapa]] in [[Mexico City]], [[Taxco]], [[San Miguel de Allende]] and [[Procession of Silence in San Luis Potosi|San Luis Potosí]].

As most Holy Week related events occur outside and in large gatherings, [[Mexican street food|“antojitos” (roughly translated as Mexican street food or snacks)]] is the most associated with the holiday. Prior to Easter Sunday, Lenten dietary rules are still in effect for the observant, so popular street foods include [[pambazo]]s with cheese, fried fish, fried plantains, hot cakes/pancakes with various toppings. Candies are a popular street food at this time, especially traditional and regional ones made from coconut, [[tamarind]] and various fruits. Holy Week was also the traditional start of the ice cream and flavored ice season, which was originally made in Mexico City with ice and snow brought down from the [[Popocatepetl]] volcano. Ice cream fairs are still held at this time. Today’s frozen treats include ice cream in tubs, as well as popsicles made from both fruit and cream, as well as snow cones called “[[raspados]].” Another popular refreshment is called “[[aguas frescas]]” or sugared drinks made from fruit or other natural flavorings such as tamarind or [[hibiscus]] flowers. The reason for the popularity of both frozen desserts and flavored drinks is that spring to early summer is generally the warmest part of the year in many parts of Mexico.&lt;ref name="foodeaster"/&gt;

Just before Holy Week proper, there are two events celebrated in various parts of the country. The first is the feast of the Virgin of Sorrows (Virgen de los Dolores). This occurs the Friday before Good Friday and focuses on the pain and sacrifice of Mary knowing that Jesus had to die to save mankind. This image of the Virgin is usually dressed in purple and altars are set up to her on this day.&lt;ref name="foodeaster"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jking"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1407-our-lady-of-the-sorrows-nuestra-se%C3%B1ora-de-los-dolores |author=Judy King |title= Our Lady of the Sorrows – Nuestra Señora de los Dolores |date= January 1, 2006 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089  |accessdate=January 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Wednesday before Easter, a mass called the “vespers of darkness” (los matines de la tinieblas) recalls the disciples’ abandonment of Jesus. The altar of the church will have a [[candelabra]] with fifteen candles, with one candle extinguished after the singing of a [[Psalms|Psalm]] until only the center candle, representing Jesus, remains lit.&lt;ref name="dhoyt"/&gt;

Holy Week begins on Palm Sunday, and many communities have special masses dedicated to the blessing of palm fronds. These fronds are often woven into crosses and other designs, sometimes quite intricate and brought by parishioners to have holy water sprinkled on them. Some fronds are later burned and the ashes saved for marking foreheads on the following Ash Wednesday. Maundy Thursday is the beginning of the celebration of Easter proper. Cathedrals in the country have special masses celebrated by bishops, with “[[chrism]]” a sacred oil used in the sacraments, is consecrated. Many churches also hold reenactments of the [[Last Supper]], but Masses usually omit the exchanges of greeting of peace as a reminder of [[Judas Iscariot#Betrayal of Jesus|Judas’ betrayal of Jesus]]. From this day through Holy Saturday, church bells are traditionally not rung.&lt;ref name="dhoyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jallen"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3117-silver-saints-and-sinners%E2%84%A2-semana-santa-in-taxco-mexico |author=Jim Allen |author2=Jan McHargue |title= Silver, saints, and sinners™: Semana Santa in Taxco, Mexico |date= January 1, 2002 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089  |accessdate=January 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reenactments of the day of crucifixion take place in almost all communities in Mexico on Good Friday and for a number these traditions extends to a passion play enacted most or all of Holy Week. The focus of these reenactments focus on the carrying of the cross by Jesus and his crucifixion as told by the [[Stations of the Cross]]. In major productions, hundreds of people participate including the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem, the [[Last Supper]], the Betrayal, the Judgment, the procession with the cross, the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] up to the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] .&lt;ref name="dhoyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foodeaster"/&gt;

Holy Saturday is dedicated to vigil as the waiting time between Jesus’ death and resurrection. Statues of the Virgin Mary are dressed in black as a symbol of mourning.&lt;ref name="anwall"/&gt; Frequently there is a solemn evening mass during which participants hold lighted candles. This is then followed by an event called the Burning of Judas mostly practiced in central and southern Mexico.&lt;ref name="dhoyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anwall"/&gt; Originally, it was the burning in [[effigy]] of the disciple that betrayed Jesus, a custom introduced to Mexico as part of the evangelization process. During the [[Mexican Inquisition]], effigies were also burnt to mock and protest the burning of people at the stake. These effigies were banned but the idea of protest was transferred to the Judas figures. The Burning of Judas continues in other places but it has been banned in Mexico City because of safety and pollution concerns. The figures are still made in the city but many are now collector’s items.&lt;ref name="zedillo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx/welcome/PAGES/culture/note_semanasanta.html |title= Semana Santa |work= Mexico and its culture |publisher=Government of Mexico |location=Mexico |accessdate=January 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Easter Sunday is celebrated with mass which is usually crowded. Church bells will again ring and the plazas around the churches after Mass will be crowded with churchgoers as well as street vendors selling food, toys, balloons and more.&lt;ref name="dhoyt"/&gt;

==Regional variations in observance==

[[File:GFProcessionXochis07.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Amuzgo people|Amuzgo]] Good Friday procession in [[Xochistlahuaca]].]]
In many areas, processions, masses and other activities extend for another week.&lt;ref name="ganderson"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3214-semana-santa-holy-week-in-san-miguel-de-allende |author=Geri Anderson |title= Semana Santa Holy Week in San Miguel de Allende |date= January 16, 2008 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089  |accessdate=January 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico’s Holy Week traditions are based on Spanish ones brought over during the Conquest, along with those created during the evangelization process with some indigenous influence. This has resulted in variations in the celebrations in various regions and towns.&lt;ref name="dhoyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anwall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ganderson"/&gt; A number of these variations have become well known, such as those in [[Taxco]], [[San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí|San Luis Potosí]], [[San Miguel de Allende]], [[Ajijic]], and [[Iztapalapa]] in Mexico City. Other communities with notable celebrations include [[Pátzcuaro]], [[Tzintzuntzan, Michoacán|Tzintzuntzan]], [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]], [[Huajicori]], [[Cora people|Mesa de Nayar]], [[Creel, Chihuahua|Creel]], Cusarare (Chihuahua), San Ignacio Arareco (Chihuahua), [[Jerez, Zacatecas|Jerez]], [[Atlixco]], [[Temascalcingo]], [[San Juan Chamula]] and [[Zinacantán]].&lt;ref name="dhoyt"/&gt;

The most famous passion play in Mexico is held in Iztapalapa in the east of Mexico City. This production involves over 4000 local residents (all of which are born in Iztapalapa) which perform scenes related to the last week of Jesus’s life from Palm Sunday to Good Friday. The production has been done each year since 1843 and today the spectacle attracts over 2 million spectators, mostly Mexican. The play is not a strictly Biblical production as there are a number of characters such as a spy, a dog, a “wandering Jew” and others that are unique to this event. When Christ is captured, [[Huehuetl|Aztec drums]] and flutes are played. [[Pontius Pilate]] sentences Jesus on the town of Iztapalapa’s main square then whipped. He then carries a cross from this square to the [[Cerro de la Estrella National Park|Cerro de la Estrella]] on a route over mile long through eight of the borough’s oldest neighborhoods.  The most important event is the procession with the cross and the crucifixion scene portrayed on Cerro de la Estrella. Many others called “Nazarenes” follow, carrying their own crosses and wearing real crowns of thorns like Jesus. The play ends with Judas hanging himself after the crucifixion.&lt;ref name="anwall"/&gt;

Another important and unique commemoration of Holy Week occurs in Taxco in the state of [[Guerrero]]. It begins on Palm Sunday, with a large wooden statue of Christ traveling on a donkey from the town of Tehuilotepec about four miles to the center of Taxco. The image is preceded in its entrance to Taxco by children on bicycles and residents portraying the [[Twelve Apostles]] as well as drummer. Processions continue all week, led by very young children dressed as angels, immediately followed by older girls dressed in white with white veils, walking barefoot and swinging incense burners containing copal. In these processions, Biblical figures related to the [[Passion of Christ]] are represented by wooden statues from the town and surrounding villages, carried on litters, accompanied by musical instruments playing melodies with pre Hispanic influence. The most notable aspect of these processions are the [[Confraternity of penitents|penitents]] who inflict pain and suffering on themselves during the processions. While these displays have moderated or disappeared in other parts of Mexico, they remain severe in Taxco. Penitents form into three brotherhoods called the Animas or Bent Ones, the Encruzados (the Crossed) and the Flagelantes (Flagellants). All wear black robes, a horsehair belt and a hood to hide their identity. The Animas walk in procession bent at the waist, never straightening, carrying relics, crosses or candles. This is the only brotherhood that admits women, who are distinguished by lighter chains attached to their ankles. The Encruzados carry a bundle of thorned blackberry canes of up to 100 pounds tied onto their shirtless back and arms with a candle in each hand. The Flagelantes are also bare backed and carry a large wooden cross, in their arms, in their hands are a rosary and a whip with metal points. At appointed places, the penitent hands off the cross, kneels and whips his back. One Maundy Thursday, a scene recreating the Garden of [[Gethsemane]] is set up at the Santa Prisca church and on Friday, the statue of Jesus praying is “captured” and “jailed.” On Friday it is “crucified” inside the church with the penitent brotherhoods looking on. A candlelight vigil is on Holy Saturday ending late in the night with the announcement that Christ has risen. Easter Sunday is quiet.&lt;ref name="jallen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="neubauer"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/710-the-passion-of-christ-in-a-neighborhood-of-crime-and-poverty |author=John Neubauer|title= The passion of Christ in Ixtapalapa, a Mexico City neighborhood |date= February 15, 2007 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089  |accessdate=January 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Miguel de Allende is noted for its observances of Holy Week, and for two weeks there is at least one procession per day.&lt;ref name="ganderson"/&gt;  The focus for much of the pageantry is the “El Señor de la Columna” Christ image, which is brought from the [[sanctuary of Atotonilco]] and paraded among the various churches of the area from the Sunday before Palm Sunday to the Wednesday after Easter when it returns to Atotonilco. On Good Friday, this image is carried to the parish church of San Miguel, accompanied by residents dressed as the disciples and Roman soldiers. At noon, images of the [[Holy Family]], the disciples, [[Mary Magdalene]] and [[John the Baptist]] are also in procession and a passion play is performed. At dark, the images reappear in procession but dressed in black and accompanied by measured drumbeats.&lt;ref name="ganderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cwheeler"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3617-good-friday-in-san-miguel-de-allende |author=Carol Wheeler|title= Good Friday in San Miguel de Allende |date= March 31, 2010 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089  |accessdate=January 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, concheros dancers sporadically appear, especially in the main square of San Miguel. The Burning of Judas occurs on Easter Sunday, not Holy Saturday.&lt;ref name="ganderson"/&gt;

A number of cities and towns hold Processions of Silence, where people march on the street holding candles in silence. The custom comes from the Spanish city of [[Holy Week in Seville|Seville]] .&lt;ref name="anwall"/&gt; The most important of these processions is held in the [[Procession of Silence in San Luis Potosi|city of San Luis Potosí on Good Friday]]. It begins at 8pm at the Plaza del Carmen, with actors dressed as Roman troops playing drums and bugle. This guard then knocks on the door of the Carmen Church. The beginning of the procession leaves the church, carrying crosses and paschal candles. They are joined by more as they move onto the streets, dressed in white robes with cone shaped hoods with symbols denoting what religious group they belong to. In addition to the robed participants, there are also those dressed as [[charro]]s, and Adelitas (women of  the [[Mexican Revolution]]) as well as some in indigenous dress. The focal point of the procession is a large figure of the Virgin of Solitude, the Virgin Mary left alone after the death of Jesus. It and its platform weigh more than a ton and are carried on the shoulders of forty men. The procession continues around the town, punctuated by ritual speeches until midnight, when the last of the robed figures returns to the Carmen Church.&lt;ref name="luisgob"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanluis.gob.mx/livingsanluis/procesion.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611161715/http://www.sanluis.gob.mx/livingsanluis/procesion.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 11, 2013 |title=Procession of the Silence |publisher=Government of San Luis Potosi |location=Mexico |accessdate=January 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tzintzuntzan, Michoacán|Tzintzuntzan]] for most of Holy Week, there are men on horseback, in red hoods and lavender robes that patrol the area to make sure that stores or craftsmen are doing business as usual. A central activity are processions with penitents led by seven large crosses which have been in the care of seven family for generations. These crosses are then at the front of the parish church on Good Friday as a passion play is performed. Local legend says that as recently as the 1970s, in a nearby village, penitents still had themselves nailed to crosses.&lt;ref name="hproppe"&gt;{{cite news |title= Semana Santa: Holy Week in Tzintzuntzan, Mexico (PHOTOS) |author=Hans Proppe |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hans-proppe/holy-week-in-mexico_b_1397988.html |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=April 3, 2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major pilgrimage site for Holy Week is [[Chalma, Malinalco|Chalma]], the second most visited pilgrimage site in Mexico after the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]]. The focus of the pilgrimage is an image of a black crucified Christ and the rites here are a mix of Christian and pre Hispanic influences, such as bathers dipping into a fresh water spring for purification.  Dance is a central part of the rites, and an Aztec tradition states that newcomers are obliged to dance for at least one tune.&lt;ref name="allthings"&gt;{{cite news |title= ANALYSIS: CATHOLICS IN MEXICO VISIT HOLY SITES OF CHURCH AT CHALMA DURING HOLY WEEK |newspaper=All Things Considered |location=Washington, DC |date=March 28, 2002 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important events for Holy Week include a procession behind a black faced Christ figure in Patzcuaro, the veneration of a purple-robed paper mache image of Christ at the [[Church of San Francisco, Madero Street, Mexico City|San Francisco Church]] in the [[historic center of Mexico City]] and that of the [[Tarahumara people|Tarahumara]] in Chihuahua, who paint themselves white for ritual.&lt;ref name="anwall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="neubauer"/&gt;

==The vacation period==
In addition to its importance religiously, it has also become a very important vacation period. Many companies shut down in order to provide time off especially between Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday, with some having the following week off as well.&lt;ref name="psainz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dhoyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; Schoolchildren up to high school generally get two weeks off but university students get only one week.&lt;ref name="anwall"/&gt; The only class of workers working in full that week are those in the tourism industry.&lt;ref name="dhoyt"/&gt; While the original reason for the time off was for religious observance, many skip this aspect at least for part of the time to go on vacation.&lt;ref name="foodeaster"/&gt;

Hotels, restaurants and more are crowded, especially at major resorts and other tourist destinations. Airline and other transport prices tend to be higher with terminals crowded at the very beginning and end of the vacation period. Highways will also be heavily used.&lt;ref name="dhoyt"/&gt; In 2010 over nine million Mexicans traveled somewhere for the holiday with an economic impact of over ten billion pesos.&lt;ref name="nueve"&gt;{{cite news |title= Viajarán más de nueve millones de turistas por México en Semana Santa  |newspaper= NOTIMEX |date=March 18, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=More than 9 million tourists will travel in Mexico during Holy Week |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the Mexico City eastern bus terminal, [[Terminal de Autobuses de Pasajeros de Oriente|TAPO]], served 180,000 people per day during Holy Week, about double its normal volume.&lt;ref name="tapo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Atiende la TAPO a 180 mil usuarios al día durante Semana Santa  |newspaper= NOTIMEX |date=April 21, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=TAPO attends 180,000 travelers a day during Holy Week |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, major metropolitan areas such as Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara tend to be quieter than normal during this week, as many workers in these cities leave for vacation and/or to visit family in the provinces.&lt;ref name="dhoyt"/&gt;

The most important vacation spots at this time are beach areas such as [[Acapulco]], [[Cancún]], [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], [[Mazatlan]], [[Los Cabos (Baja California Sur)|Los Cabos]] and [[Huatulco]]. These vacations are generally taken together as families.&lt;ref name="nueve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cstobbs"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3757-easter-in-jaltemba-bay-mexico-semana-santa-is-a-family-affair |author=Christina Stobbs|title= Easter in Jaltemba Bay, Mexico: Semana Santa is a family affair |date= April 10, 2011 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089  |accessdate=January 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beach towns and other resorts fill with vacationers as well as street vendors and wandering musicians taking advantage of the business opportunity.&lt;ref name="cstobbs"/&gt; Occupancy rates climb to over 85% and 100% occupancy is not uncommon, leading to rooms rented in private homes. Those who cannot find accommodations often sleep in their vehicles or even on the beach.&lt;ref name="cstobbs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="busmex"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Holy Week tourism |journal=Business Mexico |volume=12 |issue=5 |date=May 2002 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other vacation destination include colonial cities in the center such as [[Morelia]], [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], Querétaro, San Miguel de Allende, Taxco, San Luis Potosí and [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] receive significant numbers of visitors as well.&lt;ref name="nueve"/&gt;

Many also cross the border into the United States during this week, especially those who live in the north and/or who have family there to visit. It is also popular to go shopping in the country at this time, making it an important time for some US retailers, especially those near the Mexican border.&lt;ref name="zeleznik"&gt;{{cite news |title= Shoppers from Mexico Head to McAllen, Texas, for Easter Week  |author=Jennine Zeleznik |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business News |date=April 19, 2003 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction''''' is a [[2015 in literature|2015]] [[non-fiction]] book by biologist [[Beth Shapiro]] and published by [[Princeton University Press]]. The book describes the current state of [[de-extinction]] technology and what the processes involved require in order to accomplish the potential resurrection of extinct species.

==Content==
The book is laid out as a step-by-step guide on how to clone an animal, with each chapter detailing a different topic that needs to be explored and answered before de-extinction of a species will be complete. This also involves a particular focus on resurrection of the [[mammoth]].&lt;ref name="IHE"&gt;{{cite news |last=McLemee |first=Scott |date=July 29, 2015 |title=On the Verge of De-Extinction |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/07/29/review-beth-shapiro-how-clone-mammoth-science-de-extinction |newspaper=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |access-date=March 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several chapters deal with the genetic material itself and how to obtain it, along with the difficulties of recovering viable DNA samples from mummified or fossilized remains. Due to the actions of [[nucleases]] after cell death, most DNA of extinct species is fragmented into small pieces that have to be reconstructed at least partially if it is to be cloned. This fragmentation means that recovery of a full extinct genome is largely impossible. Thus, only partial genes can be utilized and the most viable method is to use a close evolutionary relative of the extinct species and insert the genes that differ into an embryo of the living species.&lt;ref name="IHE"/&gt; For mammoth de-extinction, any trait consideration would involve the [[Asian elephant]], the closest still-living relative. Using genes from extrapolated mammoth DNA, the Asian elephant could be made to survive across a wider range, including cold environments, protecting it against possible extinction. This gene transfer to benefit living species is one of the primary sources of research done with de-extinction technology in addition to the desire to revive lost species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Toomey |first=Diane |date=June 17, 2015 |title=Cloning a Mammoth: Science Fiction or Conservation Tool? |url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/cloning_a_mammoth_science_fiction_or_conservation_tool/2886/ |newspaper=[[Yale Environment 360]] |access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three following chapters discuss current technology available for moving genes and creating modified elephant genomes, including [[CRISPR]] (Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats) and [[TALENS]] (Transcription Activator-like Effector Nucleases).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=Steve |date=July 11, 2015 |title=How not to clone a mammoth |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)61229-6/fulltext?rss%3Dyes |journal=[[The Lancet]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=386 |issue=9989 |pages=125 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61229-6 |access-date=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final chapters discuss the environmental benefits and potential drawbacks of mammoths or other extinct species being reintroduced. For mammoths specifically, their heavy weight and specific methods of foraging help grasslands grow in colder climates, potentially turning [[Siberia]]n [[permafrost]] into a [[tundra]]-like region with numerous plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bohac |first=Allison |date=June 13, 2015 |title=Extinct species may get a second chance |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extinct-species-may-get-second-chance |journal=[[Science News]] |publisher=[[Society for Science and the Public]] |volume=187 |issue=12 |pages=27 |doi= |access-date=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and tone==
Shaoni Bhattacharya in ''[[New Scientist]]'' noted that while the book "can be a little academic", Shapiro manages to explain "complex molecular biology clearly" and that it "really comes alive, though, when she describes her own expeditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bhattacharya |first=Shaoni |date=May 20, 2015 |title=''How to Clone a Mammoth'': But should we? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22630221-600-how-to-clone-a-mammoth-but-should-we/ |newspaper=[[New Scientist]] |access-date=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', Brian Switek describes Shapiro's writing style as "sharp, witty, and impeccably-argued" and that she writes "finely-honed prose" that "cuts through the hype that has clouded the debate" on whether it is possible to clone extinct animals and also whether such efforts should instead be directed toward assisting species that are currently in danger of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Switek |first=Brian |date=April 10, 2015 |title=Book in Brief: How to Clone a Mammoth  |url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/10/book-in-brief-how-to-clone-a-mammoth/ |newspaper=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caspar Henderson for ''[[The Spectator]]'' called the book's writing "lively, skeptical and nuanced" and stated that Shapiro covered topics with "great clarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henderson |first=Caspar |date=May 16, 2015 |title=If we recreate the mammoth, it will be 99.999 per cent white elephant |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/05/recreating-the-mammoth-99-999-per-cent-white-elephant/ |newspaper=[[The Spectator]] |access-date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', A. Rus Hoelzel characterized the writing as "rich in anecdote and scientifically precise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoelzel |first=A.

==Critical reception==
Alec Rodriguez praised the book's writing in a ''[[Yale Scientific]]'' article, approving of the conciseness and yet approachable technical detail that is included in the book while still remaining smooth in its flow between subjects. Rodriguez concluded that the book also "leaves the reader optimistic" in regards to future scientific advancements and the usage of [[Pleistocene Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rodriguez |first=Alec |date=November 4, 2015 |title=Book Review: How to Clone a Mammoth |url=http://www.yalescientific.org/2015/11/book-review-how-to-clone-a-mammoth/ |newspaper=[[Yale Scientific]] |access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Times Higher Education]]'''s Tiffany Taylor considered the work a "thought-provoking book [that] offers excitement and wonder" and that, through Shapiro's writing and direct discussion, the book manages to "paint a scientifically accurate yet magical world where Pleistocene giants might roam the Arctic tundra once again, and where we have the chance to undo some past mistakes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Tiffany |date=May 21, 2015 |title=How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-extinction, by Beth Shapiro |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/how-to-clone-a-mammoth-thescience-of-de-extinction-by-beth-shapiro/2020229.article |newspaper=[[Times Higher Education]] |access-date=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' applauded the book's attempt to state plainly the science involved and determined that readers will "emerge with the ability to think more deeply about the facts of de-extinction and cloning at a time when hyperbolic and emotionally manipulative claims about such scientific breakthroughs are all too common".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Nonfiction Book Review: How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-691-15705-4 |newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=March 23, 2015 |access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kent H. Redford in the journal ''[[Oryx (journal)|Oryx]]'' recommended that others read the book, adding that it "will make everyone think, will make some mad, others inspired, and hopefully will educate all conservationists to the extraordinary potential opportunities, good and bad, that de-extinction presents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Redford |first=Kent H. |date=January 2016 |title=Publications: How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-extinction |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=10083476&amp;fileId=S0030605315001350 |journal=[[Oryx (journal)|Oryx]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=186 |doi=10.1017/S0030605315001350 |access-date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]'', Derek D. Turner called the writing "careful, accessible, and thoughtful", while also pointing out that the book as a whole "conveys a sense of excitement about the science, but without the uncritical techno-optimism that one sees in many popular articles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turner |first=Derek D. |date=March 2016 |title=New Biological Books: How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/685309?journalCode=qrb |journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=73 |doi=10.1086/685309 |access-date=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip J. Seddon in an article for the journal ''[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]]'' described the book as an "important contribution to the ongoing debate" by how it changed the focus on what de-extinction is about to "ecological resurrection, and not species resurrection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seddon |first=Philip J. |date=October 2015 |title=De-extinction: Reframing the Possible |url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347(15)00206-2 |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=569–570 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.08.002 |access-date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hurricane Diana''' was the fourth tropical storm, the first hurricane, the first major hurricane, and the strongest storm of the [[1984 Atlantic hurricane season]].  Diana was the first major hurricane to hit the [[U.S. East Coast]] in nearly 20&amp;nbsp;years.  Watches and warnings were issued for the storm along the East coast between eastern Florida and Virginia.  It caused moderate damage in [[North Carolina]] while it looped offshore and after it made landfall as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 2 hurricane]].  Forming on September 8, Diana moved northward and wandered across North Carolina for a couple of days during mid-September, dropping heavy rainfall.  Once it left the state and accelerated east-northeast, Diana quickly evolved into an [[extratropical cyclone]].  Damages to the [[United States]] totaled $65.5&amp;nbsp;million (1984 USD).  Three indirect fatalities were caused by the [[cyclone]].

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Diana 1984 track.png}}
The origins of Hurricane Diana can be traced back to a stalled out  [[Low pressure area|area of low pressure]] just north of the [[Bahamas]] along the tail end of a [[cold front]] on September&amp;nbsp;6. [[Atmospheric convection|Shower and thunderstorm activity]] began to increase the next day but was generally disorganized. Around 1200 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on September&amp;nbsp;8, a ship in the vicinity of the low reported a [[Maximum sustained wind|sustained wind speed]] of 40&amp;nbsp;mph (65&amp;nbsp;km/h). A few hours later, based on satellite observations, the low was designated Tropical Storm Diana. With weak steering currents, Diana gradually intensified as it slowly moved towards the west over the next day, coming within 50&amp;nbsp;miles (85&amp;nbsp;km) of [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], before taking a sharp turn towards the north-northwest. As Diana neared [[Saint Augustine, Florida|Saint Augustine]], Florida, it turned towards the northeast and intensified into a hurricane.&lt;ref name="PrelimRPT1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Harold P. Gerrish| date=October 18, 1984| title=Preliminary Report: Hurricane Diana (Page One)| publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]| accessdate=2008-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1984-prelim/diana/prelim01.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under weak steering currents while detached to the front, Diana drifted westward, and came within 50&amp;nbsp;miles (85&amp;nbsp;km) of the [[Florida]] coast. Rather than continuing westward, where it would have hit near [[Cape Canaveral]], Diana turned to the northwest where it paralleled the coastline. The storm, continually strengthening over the [[Gulf Stream]], turned to the northeast and became a hurricane on September 10. On September&amp;nbsp;11 and September&amp;nbsp;12, Diana rapidly intensified to a peak of 130&amp;nbsp;mph (215&amp;nbsp;km/h) winds while remaining offshore.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

An approaching frontal system caused Diana to execute a cyclonic loop, where cool, dry air caused it to weaken. The hurricane hit [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], [[North Carolina]] as a weakening hurricane with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 100&amp;nbsp;mph (150&amp;nbsp;km/h) on September&amp;nbsp;13, and quickly weakened to a tropical storm over land.  The high pressure system that built in after Diana looped weakened, allowing the storm to move to the north and east.  After crossing the [[Outer Banks]], Diana accelerated to the northeast, and after restrengthening to a {{convert|70|mph|km/h}} storm, became extratropical near [[Nova Scotia]] on September&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;ref name="PrelimRPT2"&gt;{{cite web| author=Harold P.

Soon after advisories were initiated, [[gale]] warnings were issued between [[Cape Canaveral, Florida]] and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] during the afternoon of September&amp;nbsp;8.  During the morning of September&amp;nbsp;9, gale warnings were lowered south of [[St. Augustine, Florida]].  As Diana strengthened into a hurricane, hurricane watches and gale warnings were raised between St. Augustine and [[Oregon Inlet, North Carolina]].  By the morning of September&amp;nbsp;10, gale warnings were upgraded to hurricane warnings between [[Brunswick, Georgia]] and Oregon Inlet.  All warnings and watches south of Brunswick were dropped at that time.  By the morning of September&amp;nbsp;11, hurricane warnings were lowered south of [[Savannah, Georgia]].  That afternoon, all warnings were lowered south of [[Cape Romain, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="prep"&gt;{{cite web|author=Harrold P.

On the morning of September&amp;nbsp;12, all warnings were lowered south of [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]].  Early in the morning of September&amp;nbsp;13, gale warnings were raised between Cape Romain and Myrtle Beach.  Later that morning, hurricane warnings were lowered between [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] and Oregon Inlet, and all warnings were dropped between Cape Lookout and Virginia Beach.  Gale warnings were then in effect between Wilmington and Cape Lookout.  Once inland, all warnings were lowered on the afternoon of September&amp;nbsp;13.  As the tropical storm moved offshore, gale warnings went into effect between the mornings of September&amp;nbsp;14 and September&amp;nbsp;15 between Cape Lookout and [[Chincoteague, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="prep"/&gt;

Along the North Carolina coastline, state troopers were deployed to assist residents in evacuating and preparing for the hurricane.&lt;ref name="AP1"/&gt; South Carolina governor Mike Daniel declared a [[state of emergency]] and placed the national guard on standby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=''The Milwaukee Sentinel ''|date=September 11, 1984|accessdate=October 3, 2009|title=Hurricane Diana gaining strength|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UyQWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UhIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3152,1662527&amp;dq=hurricane+diana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools throughout the [[The Carolinas|Carolinas]] and Georgia were closed. Most beaches were closed due to strong [[rip current]]s and [[beach erosion]]. Residents on barrier islands were urged to evacuate as waves in excess of {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} were expected to inundate them. Approximately 94 families were relocated from their mobile homes near [[Beaufort, North Carolina]] by state officials. A 24-hour emergency operations center was also established. The [[Coast Guard]] moved all available boats in the area to a position where they could be deployed immediately if needed.&lt;ref name="AP1"/&gt;

Along the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] coastline, [[The Golden Isles of Georgia]] were evacuated due to large [[Swell (ocean)|swells]] produced by Diana.&lt;ref name="AP1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press|publisher=''Ocala Star-Banner''|date=September 10, 1984|accessdate=October 3, 2009|title=Florida Coastline Raked By Hurricane Diana's Fury|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WiEVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RgYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6940,4610447&amp;dq=hurricane+diana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two nursing homes in [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Tybee Island]] were evacuated and a voluntary evacuation was issued for all residents in the town.

==Impact and aftermath==
[[Image:Diana 1984 rainfall.gif|thumb|right|Rainfall totals]]
With Category&amp;nbsp;4 winds of {{convert|130|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, Diana threatened to become the most intense hurricane to strike [[North Carolina]] since [[Hurricane Hazel]] in 1954. However, it looped and weakened just offshore and made landfall as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 2 hurricane]].&lt;ref name="PrelimRPT1"/&gt; Because of this, Diana only caused $65.5&amp;nbsp;million in damage (1984&amp;nbsp;USD) due to heavy flooding from up to {{convert|19|in|mm}} of rain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David M. Roth|year=2006|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/diana1984.html|title=Hurricane Diana Rainfall Page|accessdate=2008-12-31|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; tree damage, and downed power lines. Most of the damage was experienced between [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] and [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]].  The Carolina Power and Light Brunswick Nuclear Power Plant recorded winds of over 75&amp;nbsp;mph, making Hurricane Diana the first hurricane to bring hurricane force winds to a nuclear power plant. Some yard damage was seen, but the plant was mostly unaffected.&lt;ref name="PrelimRPT3"/&gt;

Three indirect deaths were reported from Diana. One person died from a heart attack while making hurricane preparations, and the other two were from automobile accidents.&lt;ref name="PrelimRPT3"&gt;{{cite web| author=Harold P.

The '''Ilumina Festival''' is an annual [[chamber music]] festival held in [[Brazil]].

The festival combines the objective of producing high-end [[classical music]] with a deep-rooted social mission. Professional soloists from multiple nationalities converge in a secluded venue in rural Brazil, where they commune and collaborate with a selected group of outstanding young local talents at the start of their professional careers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmais.com.br/arte-e-cultura/noticias/voltado-para-a-musica-de-camara-ilumina-festival-estreia-no-brasil-com-direcao-de-jennifer-stumm Brazilian Public Broadcasting Service Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through a series of rehearsals, workshops, and masterclasses, all musicians prepare, together, for a set of concerts, open to the public and free of charge, aimed at bringing chamber music to audiences that would have otherwise limited access to it. Both soloists and fellows feed off each other’s input, and the experience provides a sizeable professional boost for alumni’s careers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.cultura.sp.gov.br/portal/site/SEC/menuitem.71b090bd301a70e06d006810ca60c1a0/?vgnextoid=f117132b8f86e410VgnVCM1000008936c80aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default#.ViK-FSt4SuR São Paulo State Government Article on Music Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival operates on a non-profit basis and relies on donors, sponsors and supporters for financial viability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.iluminafestival.org Festival Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded by American violist and artistic director [[Jennifer Stumm]], the festival held its first edition in the city of [[São Bento do Sapucaí]], in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.otempo.com.br/divers%C3%A3o/magazine/a-mantiqueira-e-os-eruditos-1.966664|title = Local Newspaper Article on Ilumina Festival|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invited soloists for the first edition included Cristian
Budu, Joseph Conyers, Giovanni Gnocchi, Esther Hoppe and Alexandra Soumm.

Concerts were held in São Bento do Sapucaí and Campos do Jordão and
included works by [[Thomas Adès]], [[Anton Arensky]], [[Marcos Balter]], [[Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Osvaldo Golijov]], [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Bright Sheng]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://concerto.com.br/contraponto.asp?id=2831 Concerto Magazine Article on Ilumina Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alumni from the first edition went on to new professional
jobs in classical music, and to be accepted into some of the world’s leading
conservatories and music programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = São Paulo Music School Article on Alumni|url = http://emesp.org.br/noticias/bolsista-da-orquestra-jovem-do-estado-e-aprovado-em-universidade-da-austria#.ViK-yit4SuR|website = emesp.org.br|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2016 Edition ==
The second edition of the festival was held in the [[São Paulo (state)|State of São Paulo]] from January 02 to 10, 2016.

All told, 7 international soloists and 20 fellows attended.

3 concerts were held: The first at the Serrinha farm, home of the festival in 2016, to an audience consisting of local community members and farm workers. The next one at the central church of [[Piracaia]], the farm's neighboring town, again to a local audience lacking any regular classical music opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catracalivre.com.br/sp/agenda/gratis/masp-e-tomado-por-musica-classica-com-o-ilumina-festival/|title=Catraca Livre - Agenda Gratis|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The final performance was an all-day chamber music residency at [[São Paulo Museum of Art|MASP]], consisting of the festival’s closing concert as well as pop-up concerts throughout the museum and public areas, including the Avenida Paulista, São Paulo’s main thoroughfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://masp.art.br/masp2010/espetaculo_evento_integra.php?id=88|title=MASP - São Paulo Museum of Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All concerts were free of charge and fully attended, with tickets for the final concert being claimed within an hour of being made available. The festival received ample coverage through broadcast and printed media, as well as online, including by [[TV Cultura|Cultura]], São Paulo's Public Broadcasting Service, [[Rede Globo]] and [[O Estado de S. Paulo|Estado de S. Paulo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culturafm.cmais.com.br/radiometropolis/ilumina-festival-reune-solistas-internacionais-e-jovens-brasileiros-em-series-de-camara|title=Cultura - São Paulo Public Broadcasting Service Article|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partnerships were formed with [[Sociedade de Cultura Artística|Cultura Artistica]] and the Minerva Kunststiftung, and fundraisers were held in São Paulo and London to keep operations financially viable. The festival was delivered within budget.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Alumni from the second edition were also subsequently admitted into some of the world's leading conservatories, including the [[Mozarteum University of Salzburg|Mozarteum Salzburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2016/07/fantastico-conta-luta-de-jovem-brasileiro-para-se-tornar-violinista.html|title=Rede Globo - Fantástico conta a luta de jovem brasileiro para se tornar violinista|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Khuzestan Arab separatism}}

The '''Iranian Embassy siege''' took place from 30 April to 5 May 1980, after a group of six armed men stormed the [[Embassy of Iran, London|Iranian embassy]] in [[South Kensington]], London. The gunmen, members of Arabs of KSA group campaigning for Arab national sovereignty in the southern Iranian region of [[Khuzestan Province]], took 26 people hostage, mostly embassy staff, but also several visitors, as well as a police officer who had been guarding the embassy. They demanded the release of Arab prisoners from prisons in Khuzestan and their own safe passage out of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="in depth"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/iranian_embassy_siege/720640.stm|title=In Depth: Iran and the hostage-takers|date=26 April 2000|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[First Thatcher ministry|government]] quickly resolved that safe passage would not be granted, and a siege ensued. Over the following days, police negotiators secured the release of five hostages in exchange for minor concessions, such as the broadcasting of the hostage-takers' demands on British television.

By the sixth day of the siege the gunmen had become increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed one of the hostages and threw his body out of the embassy. As a result, the government ordered the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), a [[special forces]] regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault, known as Operation Nimrod, to rescue the remaining hostages. Shortly afterwards, SAS soldiers [[Abseiling|abseil]]ed from the roof of the building and forced entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid, they rescued all but one of the remaining hostages, and killed five of the six hostage-takers. The soldiers later faced accusations of unnecessarily killing two of the five, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The sole remaining gunman was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.

The hostage-takers and their cause were largely forgotten after the [[Iran–Iraq War]] broke out later that year and the [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage crisis in Tehran]] continued until January 1981. Nonetheless, the operation brought the SAS to the public eye for the first time and bolstered the reputation of Thatcher. The SAS was quickly overwhelmed by the number of applications it received from people inspired by the operation and experienced greater demand for its expertise from foreign governments. The building, having suffered major damage from a fire that broke out during the assault, was not reopened as the Iranian embassy until 1993.

==Background==

===Motives===
{{main|1979 Khuzestan uprising}}
[[File:16 Princes Gate.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph|The front of the Iranian embassy in 2008]]
The hostage-takers were members of the [[Democratic Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Arabistan]] (DRFLA), Iranian Arabs protesting for the establishment of an autonomous Arab state in the southern region of the Iranian province of [[Khūzestān Province|Khūzestān]]&lt;ref name="p15"&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; which is home to an Arabic-speaking minority. The oil-rich area had become the source of much of Iran's wealth, having been developed by multi-national companies during the reign of the [[Shah]].&lt;ref name="p15"/&gt;

According to Oan Ali Mohammed,{{refn|Also spelt "Awn", codenamed "Salim" by the police.&lt;ref name="fear"/&gt;|group=note}} suppression of the Arab sovereignty movement was the spark that led to his desire to attack the Iranian Embassy in London. The plan was inspired by the [[Iran hostage crisis]] in which supporters of the revolution held the staff of the American embassy in Tehran hostage.&lt;ref name="in depth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival in London===
Using Iraqi passports, Oan and three other members of the DRFLA arrived in London on 31 March 1980 and rented a flat in [[Earls Court]]. They claimed they had met by chance on the flight. The men typically returned to the flat drunk, late at night, and sometimes accompanied by prostitutes. Within a week, the housekeeper asked them to leave. They soon found another flat, where they told their new landlord they were moving because they had been joined by other men and required larger accommodation. Over the following days, the group swelled, with up to a dozen men in the flat on one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oan was 27 and from Khūzestān; he had studied at the [[University of Tehran]], where he became politically active. He had been imprisoned by [[SAVAK]], the Shah's [[secret police]], and bore scars which he said were from torture in SAVAK custody. The other members of his group were Shakir Abdullah Radhil, known as "Faisal", Oan's second-in-command who also claimed to have been tortured by SAVAK; Shakir Sultan Said, or "Hassan"; Themir Moammed Hussein, or Abbas; Fowzi Badavi Nejad, or "Ali"; and Makki Hanoun Ali, the youngest of the group, who went by the name of "Makki".&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Firm &amp; Pearson, p. VIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April the men informed their landlord that they were going to [[Bristol]] for a week and then returning to Iraq, stated that they would no longer require the flat, and arranged for their belongings to be sent to Iraq. They left the building at 09:30 ([[British Summer Time|BST]]) on 30 April.&lt;ref name="10–13"/&gt; Their initial destination is unknown, but en route to the Iranian Embassy they collected firearms (including pistols and [[submachine gun]]s), ammunition and hand grenades. The weapons, predominantly Soviet-made, are believed to have been smuggled into the United Kingdom in a [[diplomatic bag]] belonging to Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before 11:30, and almost two hours after vacating the nearby flat in [[Lexham Gardens]] in [[South Kensington]], the six men arrived outside the embassy.&lt;ref name="10–13"&gt;''Siege'', pp. 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Air Service===
The [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) is a regiment of the [[British Army]] and part of the United Kingdom's [[special forces]]. The regiment was formed by Colonel [[David Stirling]] in Africa in 1941, at the height of the [[Second World War]]. Its original role was to penetrate enemy lines and strike at airfields and supply lines deep in enemy territory, first in North Africa and later around the Mediterranean and in occupied Europe. Stirling established the principle of using small teams, usually of just four men, to carry out raids, having realised that a four-man team could sometimes prove much more effective than a unit of hundreds of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Western governments were prompted to form specialist anti-terrorist units following the "[[Munich massacre]]". During the 1972 Olympic Games, a firefight between a group of hostage-takers and West German police left a police officer and all the hostages dead. The British government, worried that the country was unprepared for a similar crisis in the United Kingdom, ordered the formation of the Counter Revolutionary Warfare (CRW) Wing of the SAS, which became the UK's primary anti-terrorist and anti-hijacking unit.

The SAS had taken part in counter-insurgency operations abroad since 1945, and had trained the bodyguards of influential people whose deaths would be contrary to British interests. Thus, it was believed to be better prepared for the role than any unit in the police or elsewhere in the armed forces. The CRW Wing's first operational experience was the storming of [[Lufthansa Flight 181]] in 1977, when a small detachment of soldiers were sent to assist [[GSG 9]], the elite West German police unit set up after the events of 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, pp. 8–10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Siege==

===Day one: 30 April===

At approximately 11:30 on Wednesday 30 April the six heavily armed members of DRFLA stormed the Iranian Embassy building on Princes Gate, [[South Kensington]]. The gunmen quickly overpowered [[Police Constable]] Trevor Lock of the [[Metropolitan Police]]'s [[Diplomatic Protection Group]] (DPG). Lock was carrying a concealed [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] .38-calibre revolver,&lt;ref&gt;Firmin &amp; Pearson, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; but was unable to draw it before he was overpowered, although he did manage to press the "panic button" on his radio. Lock was later frisked, but the gunman conducting the search did not find the constable's weapon. He remained in possession of the revolver, and to keep it concealed refused to remove his coat, which he told the gunmen was to "preserve his image" as a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', p68.&lt;/ref&gt; The officer also refused offers of food throughout the siege for fear that the weapon would be seen if he had to use the toilet and a gunman decided to escort him.&lt;ref&gt;Firmin &amp; Pearson, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority of the people in the embassy were captured, three managed to escape; two by climbing out of a ground-floor window and the third by climbing across a first-floor (second-floor in American dialect) parapet to the Ethiopian Embassy next door. A fourth person, Gholam-Ali Afrouz, the chargé d'affaires and thus most senior Iranian official present, briefly escaped by jumping out of a first-floor window, but was injured in the process and quickly captured. Afrouz and the 25 other hostages were all taken to a room on the second floor.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', pp. 14–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the hostages were embassy staff, predominantly Iranian nationals, but several British employees were also captured. The other hostages were all visitors, with the exception of Lock, the British police officer guarding the embassy. Afrouz had been appointed to the position less than a year before, his predecessor having been dismissed after the revolution. Abbas Fallahi, who had been a butler before the revolution, was appointed the doorman by Afrouz. One of the British members of staff was Ron Morris, from [[Battersea]], who had worked for the embassy in various positions since 1947.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of the siege, police and journalists established the identities of several other hostages. [[Mustapha Karkouti]] was a journalist covering the crisis at the US Embassy in Tehran and was at the embassy for an interview with Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad Hashir Faruqi was another journalist, at the embassy to interview Afrouz for an article on the Iranian Revolution. Simeon "Sim" Harris and Chris Cramer, both employees of the BBC, were at the embassy attempting to obtain visas to visit Iran, hoping to cover the aftermath of the 1979 revolution, after several unsuccessful attempts. They found themselves sitting next to Moutaba Mehrnavard, who was there to consult Ahmad Dadgar, the embassy's medical adviser, and Ali Asghar Tabatabai, who was collecting a map for use in a presentation he had been asked to give at the end of a course he had been attending.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', pp. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Police arrived at the embassy almost immediately after the first reports of gunfire, and, within ten minutes, seven DPG officers were on the scene. The officers moved to surround the embassy, but retreated when a gunman appeared at a window and threatened to open fire. Deputy Assistant Commissioner [[John Dellow]] arrived nearly 30 minutes later and took command of the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Firmin &amp; Pearson p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Dellow established a temporary headquarters in his car before moving it to the [[Royal School of Needlework]] further down Princes Gate and then to 24 Princes Gate, a nursery school.&lt;ref&gt;Firmin &amp; Pearson, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; From his various command posts, Dellow coordinated the police response, including the deployment of [[Specialist Firearms Command|D11]], the Metropolitan Police's marksmen,{{refn|British police officers [[Police use of firearms in the United Kingdom|do not routinely carry firearms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10260298|title=Q&amp;A: Armed police in the UK|date=8 June 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} and officers with specialist surveillance equipment. Police negotiators made contact with Oan via a [[field telephone]] passed through one of the embassy windows, and were assisted by a negotiator and a psychiatrist. At 15:15 Oan issued the DRFLA's first demand, the release of 91 Arabs held in prisons in Khūzestān, and threatened to blow up the embassy and the hostages if this were not done by noon on 1 May.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Siege! p 32"&gt;''Siege!'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Large numbers of journalists were on the scene quickly and were moved into a holding area to the west of the front of the embassy,&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; while dozens of Iranian protesters also arrived near the embassy and remained there throughout the siege.&lt;ref&gt;McNee, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the beginning of the crisis, the British government's emergency committee [[Cabinet Office Briefing Room|COBRA]],{{refn|The committee is named after the room in which it meets, the Cabinet Office Briefing Room, but is almost invariably abbreviated to "COBRA".&lt;ref&gt;Waldren, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} was assembled. COBRA is made up of ministers, civil servants and expert advisers, including representatives from the police and the armed forces. The meeting was chaired by [[William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw|William Whitelaw]], the [[Home Secretary]], as [[Margaret Thatcher]], the Prime Minister, was unavailable.  The Iranian government  accused the British and American governments of sponsoring the attack as revenge for the [[Iran hostage crisis|ongoing siege]] of the US Embassy in Tehran. Given the lack of co-operation from Iran, Thatcher, kept apprised of the situation by Whitelaw, determined that British law would be applied to the embassy, despite the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations|Vienna Convention]], under which the embassy is considered Iranian soil.&lt;ref name="p.22"&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 16:30, the gunmen released their first hostage, Frieda Mozaffarian. She had been unwell since the siege began, and Oan had asked for a doctor to be sent into the embassy to treat her, but the police refused. The other hostages deceived Oan into believing that Mozaffarian was pregnant, and Oan eventually released Mozaffarian after her condition deteriorated.&lt;ref name=" Siege! p 32"/&gt;

===Day two: 1 May===
The COBRA meetings continued through the night and into Thursday. Meanwhile, two teams were dispatched from the headquarters of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) near [[Hereford]], and arrived at a holding area in [[Regent's Park Barracks]]. The teams, from B Squadron, complemented by specialists from other squadrons, were equipped with CS gas, stun grenades, and explosives and armed with [[Browning Hi-Power]] pistols and [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]] submachine guns.{{refn|Most team members were issued with standard model MP5s, but there were not enough available at such short notice, so several members were issued with the shorter [[MP5K]] variant and two were armed with the [[MP5SD]], with built-in [[suppressor]].&lt;ref&gt;Firmin &amp; Pearson, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref&gt;Firmin &amp; Pearson, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lieutenant Colonel [[Michael Rose (British Army officer)|Michael Rose]], commander of 22 SAS had travelled ahead of the detachment and introduced himself to Dellow, the commander of the police operation. At approximately 03:30 on 1 May, one of the SAS teams moved into the building next door to the embassy, normally occupied by the [[Royal College of General Practitioners]], where they were briefed on Rose's "immediate action" plan, to be implemented should the SAS be required to storm the building before a more sophisticated plan could be formed.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:14 Princes Gate Photo 47.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph|The front of [[14 Prince's Gate, London|14 Prince's Gate]], head office of the Royal College of General Practitioners, which was used as a base by the SAS during the siege.]]

Early in the morning of 1 May, the gunmen ordered one of the hostages to telephone the [[BBC]]'s news desk. During the call, Oan took the receiver and spoke directly to the BBC journalist. He identified the group to which the gunmen belonged and stated that the non-Iranian hostages would not be harmed, but refused to allow the journalist to speak to any other hostages.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; At some point during the day, the police disabled the embassy's telephone lines, leaving the hostage-takers just the field telephone for outside communication.&lt;ref name=".25"/&gt; As the hostages woke up, Chris Cramer, a sound organiser for the BBC, appeared to become seriously ill. He and three other non-Arab hostages had decided one of them must get out, and to do this, he had convincingly exaggerated the symptoms of an existing illness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20181022055617/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/iranian_embassy_siege/705564.stm BBC News article on Chris Cramer, 20 years after the siege.]&lt;/ref&gt; His colleague, Sim Harris, was taken to the field telephone to negotiate for a doctor. The police negotiator refused the request, instead telling Harris to persuade Oan to release Cramer. The ensuing negotiations between Harris, Oan, and the police took up most of the morning, and Cramer was eventually released at 11:15. He was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, accompanied by police officers sent to gather information from him.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the deadline of noon approached, set the previous day for the release of the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed the deadline to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast.

At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead [[British Airports Authority]], owner of [[London Heathrow Airport]], was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.&lt;ref name=".25"&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Day three: 2 May===
At 09:30 on 2 May, Oan appeared at the first-floor window of the embassy to demand access to the [[telex]] system, which the police had disabled along with the telephone lines, and threatened to kill Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. The police refused and Oan pushed Ezzati, who he had been holding at gunpoint at the window, across the room, before demanding to speak to somebody from the BBC who knew Sim Harris. The police, relieved to have a demand to which they could easily agree, produced Tony Crabb, managing director of BBC Television News and Harris's boss. Oan shouted his demands; for safe passage out of the UK, to be negotiated by three ambassadors from Arab countries, to Crabb from the first-floor window, and instructed that they should be broadcast along with a statement of the hostage-takers' aims by the BBC. The [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] informally approached the embassies of Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Qatar to ask if their ambassadors would be willing to talk to the hostage-takers. The Jordanian ambassador immediately refused and the other five said they would consult their governments.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC broadcast the statement that evening, but in a form unsatisfactory to Oan, who considered it to be truncated and incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the police located the embassy caretaker and took him to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass, the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Day four: 3 May===
Oan, angered by the BBC's incorrect reporting of his demands the previous evening, contacted the police negotiators shortly after 06:00 and accused the authorities of deceiving him. He demanded to speak with an Arab ambassador, but the negotiator on duty claimed that talks were still being arranged by the Foreign Office. Recognising the delaying tactic, Oan told the negotiator that the British hostages would be the last to be released because of the British authorities' deceit. He added that a hostage would be killed unless Tony Crabb was brought back to the embassy. Crabb did not arrive at the embassy until 15:30, nearly ten hours after Oan demanded his presence, to the frustration of both Oan and Sim Harris. Oan then relayed another statement to Crabb via Mustapha Karkouti, a journalist also being held hostage in the embassy. The police guaranteed that the statement would be broadcast on the BBC's next news bulletin, in exchange for the release of two hostages. The hostages decided amongst themselves that the two to be released would be Hiyech Kanji and Ali-Guil Ghanzafar; the former as she was pregnant and the latter for no other reason than his loud snoring, which kept the other hostages awake at night and irritated the terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the evening, at approximately 23:00, an SAS team reconnoitred the roof of the embassy. They discovered a skylight, and succeeded in unlocking it for potential use as an access point, should they later be required to storm the building. They also attached ropes to the chimneys to allow soldiers to abseil down the building and gain access through the windows if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Day five: 4 May===
During the day, the Foreign Office held further talks with diplomats from Arabian countries in the hope of persuading them to go to the embassy and talk to the hostage-takers. The talks, hosted by [[Douglas Hurd]], ended in stalemate. The diplomats insisted they must be able to offer safe passage out of the UK for the gunmen, believing this to be the only way to guarantee a peaceful outcome, but the British government was adamant that safe passage would not be considered under any circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', pp. 72–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Karkhouti, through whom Oan had issued his revised demands the previous day, became increasingly ill throughout the day and by the evening was feverish, which led to suggestions that the police had spiked the food that had been sent into the embassy. John Dellow, the commander of the police operation, had apparently considered the idea and even consulted a doctor about its viability, but eventually dismissed it as "impracticable".&lt;ref name=".28"&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SAS officers involved in the operation, including Brigadier [[Peter de la Billière]], [[Director Special Forces]], Lieutenant Colonel [[Michael Rose (British Army officer)|Mike Rose]], Commander of 22 SAS, and Major Hector Gullan, commander of the team that would undertake any raid, spent the day refining their plans for an assault.&lt;ref name=".28"/&gt;

===Day six: 5 May===
Oan woke Lock at dawn, convinced that an intruder was in the embassy. Lock was sent to investigate, but no intruder was found. Later in the morning, Oan called Lock to examine a bulge in the wall separating the Iranian embassy from the Ethiopian embassy next door. The bulge had, in fact, been caused by the removal of bricks to allow an assault team to break through the wall and to implant listening devices, resulting in a weakening of the wall. Although Lock assured him that he did not believe the police were about to storm the building, Oan remained convinced that they were "up to something" and moved the male hostages from the room in which they had spent the last four days to another down the hall.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege!'', pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions rose throughout the morning and, at 13:00, Oan told the police that he would kill a hostage unless he was able to speak to an Arab ambassador within 45 minutes. At 13:40, Lock informed the negotiator that the gunmen had taken Abbas Lavasani, the embassy's chief press officer, downstairs and were preparing to execute him. Lavasani, a devout believer in the [[Iranian Revolution]], had repeatedly provoked his captors during the siege. According to Lock, Lavasani stated that "if they were going to kill a hostage, [Lavasani] wanted it to be him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Martin|last=Halfpenny|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-private-trauma-of-constable-lock-quiet-hero-of-the-iranian-embassy-siege-1960373.html|work=[[The Independent]]|title=The private trauma of Constable Lock, quiet hero of the Iranian embassy siege|date=2 May 2010|accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At exactly 13:45, 45 minutes after Oan's demand to speak to an ambassador, three shots were heard from inside the embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw, who had been chairing COBRA during the siege, was rushed back to Whitehall from a function he had been attending in [[Slough]], roughly {{convert|20|mi|km|sigfig=1}} away, arriving 19 minutes after the shots had been reported. He was briefed on the SAS plan by de la Billière, who told him to expect that up to 40 percent of the hostages would be killed in an assault. After deliberations, Whitelaw instructed the SAS to prepare to assault the building at short notice, an order that was received by Mike Rose at 15:50. By 17:00, the SAS were in a position to assault the embassy at ten minutes' notice. The police negotiators recruited the imam from a local mosque at 18:20, fearing that a "crisis point" had been reached, and asked him to talk to the gunmen. Three further shots were fired during the course of the imam's conversation with Oan. Oan announced that a hostage had been killed, and the rest would die in 30&amp;nbsp;minutes unless his demands were met. A few minutes later, Lavasani's body was dumped out of the front door. Upon a preliminary examination, conducted at the scene, a forensic pathologist estimated that Lavasani had been dead for at least an hour, meaning he could not have been killed by the three most recent shots, and leading the police to believe that two hostages had been killed. In fact, only Lavasani had been shot.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lavasani's body had been recovered, [[David McNee|Sir David McNee]], Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, contacted the Home Secretary to request approval to hand control of the operation over to the British Army, under the provisions of [[Military Aid to the Civil Authorities#Military Aid to the Civil Power|Military Aid to the Civil Power]].&lt;ref&gt;McNee, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitelaw relayed the request to Thatcher, and the prime minister agreed immediately. Thus John Dellow, the ranking police officer at the embassy, signed over control of the operation to Lieutenant Colonel Mike Rose at 19:07, authorising Rose to order an assault at his discretion. Meanwhile, the police negotiators began stalling Oan. They offered concessions in order to distract him and prevent him killing further hostages, buying time for the SAS to make its final preparations for the now-inevitable assault.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==SAS assault==
The two SAS teams on-scene, Red Team and Blue Team, were ordered to begin their simultaneous assaults, under the codename Operation Nimrod, at 19:23. One group of four men from Red Team abseiled from the roof down the rear of the building, while another four-man team lowered a [[stun grenade]] through the skylight. The detonation of the stun grenade was supposed to coincide with the abseiling teams detonating explosives to gain entry to the building through the second-floor windows. Their descent had not gone according to plan and the [[staff sergeant]] leading the abseilers became entangled in his rope. While trying to assist him, one of the other soldiers had accidentally smashed a window with his foot. The noise of the breaking window alerted Oan, who was on the first floor communicating with the police negotiators, and he went to investigate. The soldiers were unable to use explosives for fear of injuring their stranded staff sergeant, but managed to smash their way into the embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, pp. 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beeb MMV"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2000/iranian_embassy_siege/heroism.stm|title=Iranian Embassy Siege|year=2005|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sim Harris.jpg|thumb|Sim Harris making his escape across the first-floor balcony, as ordered by the masked SAS trooper ([[John McAleese|John T. McAleese]]) (far right)|alt=Refer to caption]]

After the first three soldiers entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains and out of the second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Banres, pp. 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the operation at the front of the embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/iranian_embassy_siege/705564.stm|title=Lucky to be alive|date=26 April 2000|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.&lt;ref name="Beeb MMV"/&gt;&lt;ref name=".48"&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The raid lasted seventeen minutes and involved 30–35 soldiers. The terrorists killed one hostage and seriously wounded two others during the raid while the SAS killed all but one of the terrorists. The rescued hostages and the remaining terrorist, who was still concealed amongst them, were taken into the embassy's back garden and restrained on the ground while they were identified. The last terrorist was identified by Sim Harris and led away by the SAS.&lt;ref name=".48"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Firmin &amp; Pearson, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:UK George Medal ribbon.svg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|The [[ribbon bar|ribbon]] of the [[George Medal]], which was awarded to PC Trevor Lock]]

After the end of the siege, PC Trevor Lock was widely considered a hero. He was awarded the [[George Medal]], the United Kingdom's second-highest civil honour, for his conduct during the siege and for tackling Oan during the SAS raid, the only time during the siege that he drew his concealed side arm. In addition, he was honoured with the [[Freedom of the City of London]] and in a motion in the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=48584 |supp=y|page=5531|date=13 April 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNee, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waldren 84"/&gt; Police historian Michael J. Waldren, referring to the television series ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'', suggested that Lock's restraint in the use of his revolver was "a defining example of the power of the Dixon image",&lt;ref&gt;Waldren, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; and Maurice Punch noted the contrast between Lock's actions and the highly aggressive tactics of the SAS.&lt;ref&gt;Punch, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergeant Tommy Palmer was awarded the [[Queen's Gallantry Medal]] for his part in the assault, in which he shot dead a terrorist who was apparently about to throw a grenade amongst the hostages.&lt;ref name=".57"&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; After the operation concluded, the staff sergeant who was caught in his abseil rope was treated at [[St Stephen's Hospital]] in [[Fulham]]. He suffered serious burns to his legs, but went on to make a full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iranian government welcomed the end of the siege, and declared that the two hostages killed were martyrs for the Iranian Revolution.&lt;ref name="fear"/&gt; They also thanked the British government for "the persevering action of your police force during the unjust hostage-taking event at the Embassy".&lt;ref name="in depth"/&gt;

After the assault concluded, the police conducted an investigation into the siege and the deaths of the two hostages and five terrorists, including the actions of the SAS. The soldiers' weapons were taken away for examination and, the following day, the soldiers themselves were interviewed at length by the police at the regiment's base in Hereford.&lt;ref name=".57"/&gt; There was controversy over the deaths of two terrorists in the telex room, where the male hostages were held. Hostages later said in interviews that they had persuaded their captors to surrender and television footage appeared to show them throwing weapons out of the window and holding a [[white flag]]. The two SAS soldiers who killed the men both stated at the [[Inquests in England and Wales|inquest]] into the terrorists' deaths that they believed the men had been reaching for weapons before they were shot. The inquest jury reached the verdict that the soldiers' actions were [[justifiable homicide]] (later known as "lawful killing").&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jul/24/military.features11|title=Six days that shook Britain|last=Taylor|first=Peter|date=24 July 2002|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Fowzi Nejad}}

Fowzi Nejad was the only gunman to survive the SAS assault. After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy.

==Long-term impact==
The SAS raid, codenamed "Operation Nimrod", was broadcast live at peak time on a [[bank holiday]] Monday evening and was viewed by millions of people, mostly in the UK, making it a defining moment in [[British history]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cult"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/iranian_embassy_siege/717047.stm|title=The cult of the SAS|date=26 April 2000|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] interrupted their scheduled programming to show the end of the siege,&lt;ref name="Waldren 84"&gt;Waldren, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; which proved to be a major career break for several journalists. [[Kate Adie]], the BBC's duty reporter at the embassy when the SAS assault began, went on to [[War correspondent|report from war zones across the world]] and eventually to become chief news correspondent for [[BBC News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/correspondents/newsid_2625000/2625875.stm|title=Kate Adie|work=On This Day|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=3 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[David A. Goldsmith|David Goldsmith]] and his team, responsible for the hidden camera at the back of the embassy, were awarded a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] for their coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Firmin &amp; Pearson, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the operation, combined with the high-profile it was given by the media, invoked a sense of national pride compared to [[Victory in Europe Day]], the end of the Second World War in Europe.&lt;ref name=".59"&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was declared "an almost unqualified success".&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Thatcher recalled that she was congratulated wherever she went over the following days, and received messages of support and congratulation from other world leaders.&lt;ref name=".59"/&gt; However, the incident strained already-tense [[relations between the UK and Iran]] following the Iranian Revolution. The Iranian government declared that the siege of the embassy was planned by the British and American governments, and that the hostages who had been killed were martyrs for the Revolution.&lt;ref name="fear"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/iranian_embassy_siege/703016.stm|title=Six days of fear|date=26 April 2000|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=".59"/&gt;

Operation Nimrod brought the SAS, a regiment that was largely unknown at the time owing to the [[Special forces|covert nature]] of its operations, into the public eye.&lt;ref name="fear"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Punch, pp. 155–56.&lt;/ref&gt; The regiment was not pleased with its new high profile, having enjoyed its previous obscurity. Nonetheless, the operation vindicated the SAS, which had been threatened with disbandment and whose use of resources had previously been considered a waste.&lt;ref name="fear"/&gt; The regiment was quickly overwhelmed by new applicants. Membership of 22&amp;nbsp;SAS is open only to individuals currently serving in the Armed Forces (allowing applications from any individual in any service), but the unit also has two regiments from the volunteer [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA): 21 SAS and 23 SAS. Both the TA regiments received hundreds more applications than in previous years, prompting [[Peter de la Billière|de la Billière]] to remark that the applicants seemed "convinced that a [[balaclava helmet]] and a [[Heckler &amp; Koch]] sub-machine gun would be handed to them over the counter, so that they could go off and conduct embassy-style sieges of their own".&lt;ref name=".57"/&gt; All three units were forced to introduce additional fitness tests at the start of the application process.&lt;ref name=".57"/&gt; The SAS also experienced an increased demand for their expertise in training the forces of friendly countries and those whose collapse was considered not to be in Britain's interest.&lt;ref name="cult"/&gt;&lt;ref name=".59"/&gt;

The British government's response to the crisis, and the successful use of force to end it, strengthened the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of the day and boosted Thatcher's personal credibility.&lt;ref name=".59"/&gt; McNee believed that the conclusion of the siege exemplified the British government's policy of refusing to give in to terrorist demands, "nowhere was the effectiveness of this response to terrorism more effectively demonstrated".&lt;ref&gt;McNee, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The embassy building was severely damaged by fire. It was more than a decade before the British and [[Iranian government]]s came to an agreement whereby the United Kingdom would repair the damage to the embassy in London and Iran would pay for repairs to the [[British embassy in Tehran]], which had been damaged during the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]]. Iranian diplomats began working from 16 Princes Gate again in December 1993.&lt;ref name="in depth"/&gt;

The DRFLA was undermined by its links with the [[Iraqi government]] after it emerged that Iraq had sponsored the training and equipping of the hostage-takers. The [[Iran–Iraq War]] started five months after the end of the siege and continued for eight years. The campaign for autonomy of [[Khūzestān]] was largely forgotten in the wake of the hostilities, as was the DRFLA.&lt;ref name="in depth"/&gt;

[[Image:Marshall Plan poster.JPG|thumb|left|150px|One of a number of posters created to promote the [[Marshall Plan]] in Europe.]]

After the end of [[World War II]], Italy was in ruins and occupied by foreign armies, a condition that worsened the chronic development gap towards the more advanced European economies. However, the new geopolitical logic of the [[Cold War]] made possible that the former enemy Italy, a hinge-country between [[Western Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and now a new, fragile democracy threatened by the proximity of the [[Iron Curtain]] and the presence of a strong [[Italian Communist Party|Communist party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The end of the Plan, that could have stopped the recovery, coincided with the crucial point of the [[Korea War]] (1950–1953), whose demand for metal and other manufactured products was a further stimulus to the growth of every kind of industry in Italy. In addition, the creation in 1957 of the [[European Common Market]], of which Italy was among the founder members, provided more investments and eased exports.

The above-mentioned highly favorable historical backgrounds, combined with the presence of a large and cheap stock of labour force, laid the foundations of a spectacular economic growth. The boom lasted almost uninterrupted until the "[[Hot Autumn]]'s" massive strikes and social unrest of 1969–1970, that combined with the later [[1973 oil crisis]], gradually cooled the economy, which has never returned to its heady post-war growth rates. The Italian economy experienced an average rate of growth of [[gross domestic product|GDP]] of 5.8% per year between 1951 and 1963, and 5.0% per year between 1964 and 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The impact of the economic miracle on Italian society was huge. Fast economic expansion induced massive inflows of migrants from rural Southern Italy to the industrial cities of the North. Emigration was especially directed to the factories of the so-called "industrial triangle", the region placed between the major manufacturing centres of [[Milan]] and [[Turin]] and the seaport of [[Genoa]].  Between 1955 and 1971, around 9 million people are estimated to have been involved in inter-regional migrations in Italy, uprooting entire communities and creating large metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The needs of a modernizing economy and society created a great demand for new transport and energy infrastructures. Thousands of miles of railways and highways were completed in record times to connect the main urban areas, while dams and power plants were built all over Italy, often without regard for geological and environmental conditions. A concomitant boom of the real estate market, increasingly under pressure by strong demographic growth and internal migrations, led to the explosion of urban areas. Vast neighborhoods of low-income apartments and [[social housing]] were built in the outskirts of many cities, leading over the years to severe problems of congestion, [[urban decay]] and street violence. The natural environment was constantly under strain by unregulated industrial expansion, leading to widespread air and water pollution and ecological disasters like the [[Vajont Dam]] disaster and the [[Seveso disaster|Seveso]] chemical accident, until a green consciousness developed starting from the 1980s.

Italian society, largely rural and excluded from the benefits of modern economy during the first half of the century, was suddenly flooded with a huge variety of cheap consumer goods, such as automobiles, televisions and washing machines. From 1951 to 1971, average per capita income in real terms trebled, a trend accompanied by significant improvements in consumption patterns and living conditions. In 1955, for instance, only 3% of households owned refrigerators and 1% washing machines, while by 1975 the respective figures were 94% and 76%. In addition, 66% of all homes had come to possess cars.&lt;ref&gt;Poverty and Inequality in Common Market Countries edited by Victor George and Roger Lawson&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 the national public broadcasting [[Radiotelevisione Italiana|RAI]] began a regular television service.

== Criticism ==

The pervasive influence of the [[mass media]] and [[consumerism]] on society in Italy has often been fiercely criticized by [[intellectuals]] like [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] and [[Luciano Bianciardi]], who denounced it as a sneaky form of homologation and cultural decay. Popular movies like ''[[The Easy Life]]'' (1962) and ''[[I Mostri]]'' (1963) by [[Dino Risi]], ''[[Il Boom]]'' (1963) by [[Vittorio De Sica]] and ''[[We All Loved Each Other So Much]]'' (1974) by [[Ettore Scola]] all stigmatized selfishness and immorality that characterized the miracle's roaring years.

'''Jingnan Campaign''', or '''Jingnan Rebellion''', was a [[civil war]] in the early years of the [[Ming Dynasty]] of [[China]] between the [[Jianwen Emperor]] and his uncle [[Zhu Di]], the [[Prince of Yan]]. It started in 1399 and lasted for three years. The campaign ended after the forces of the Prince of Yan captured the imperial capital [[Nanjing]]. The fall of Nanjing was followed by the demise of Jianwen Emperor, and Zhu Di was crowned the [[Yongle Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liang|2007|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

After establishing the Ming Dynasty, [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] began to consolidate the authority of the royal court. He assigned territories to the members of the royal family and stationed them across the empire. These members of the royal family did not have the administrative power over their territory, but they were entitled to a personal army that ranged from 3,000 to 19,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Every prince is entitled to three "Wei" (三護衛) of guards. There are approximately 5000-6000 men in each "Wei".&lt;/ref&gt; Royal members that were stationed in the northern frontier were entitled to even larger forces. For instance, the [[Zhu Quan|Prince of Ning]] was said to have had an army of over 80,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Ming]]'',  Volume 7: 寧獻王權，太祖第十七子。洪武二十四年封。逾二年，就藩大寧。大寧在喜峰口外，古會州地，東連遼左，西接宣府，為巨鎮。帶甲八萬，革車六千，所屬朵顏三衛騎兵皆驍勇善戰。權數會諸王出塞，以善謀稱。&lt;/ref&gt;

The original crown prince [[Zhu Biao]] died at 36 in 1392, and his son [[Zhu Yunwen]] was made the crown prince. Zhu Yunwen was the nephew of the territorial princes, and he felt threatened by their military power. In May 1398, Zhu Yunwen ascended to the throne and became the [[Jianwen Emperor]] after the death of Zhu Yuanzhang. The princes were ordered to stay in their respective territories as the new emperor began planning for the reduction of their military power with his close associates [[Qi Tai]] and [[Huang Zicheng]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Ming]]'', Volume 3: 遺詔曰：「朕膺天命三十有一年，憂危積心，日勤不怠，務有益於民。奈起自寒微，無古人之博知，好善惡惡，不及遠矣。今得萬物自然之理，其奚哀念之有。皇太孫允炆仁明孝友，天下歸心，宜登大位。內外文武臣僚同心輔政，以安吾民。喪祭儀物，毋用金玉。孝陵山川因其故，毋改作。天下臣民，哭臨三日，皆釋服，毋妨嫁娶。諸王臨國中，毋至京師。諸不在令中者，推此令從事。」&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 11: 至是燕王自北平奔喪，援遺詔止之，於是諸王皆不悅，流言煽動，聞于朝廷。謂子澄曰：「先生憶昔東角門之言乎？」對曰：「不敢忘。」於是始與泰建削藩之議。&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after his ascension to the throne, Zhu Yunwen, now the Jianwen Emperor, began the plan to reduce the power of each territorial prince. It was proposed that the power of [[Zhu Di]], the Prince of Yan, should be reduced first since he had the largest territory, but the proposal was declined.&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 1: （洪武三十一年）六月，戶部侍郎卓明請徙封燕王棣於南昌，不聽。&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1398, Prince of Zhou was arrested in [[Kaifeng]] on [[treason]] charges. He was stripped of royal status and exiled to [[Yunnan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 1: 乃命曹國公李景隆以備邊為名，猝至開封，圍王宮，執之以歸。......乃廢橚為庶人，竄蒙化。諸子皆別徙。&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1399, the princes of Qi, Xiang and Dai were stripped of their royal status. The princes of Qi and Dai were placed under house arrest in [[Nanjing]] and [[Datong]], respectively, while the Xiang prince committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: （建文元年）夏四月，湘王柏自焚死，齊王榑、代王桂有罪，廢為庶人。柏膂力過人，握刀槊弓矢，馳馬若飛。至是有告其反者。帝遣使即訊，柏焚其宮室，彎弓躍馬，投火中死。榑累歷塞上，以武功喜，時與燕通，為府中人所告；會代郡亦上變，乃廢二王為庶人，錮榑京師，幽桂大同。&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, the Prince of Min also lost his royal status and was exiled to [[Fujian]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: （建文元年）六月，岷王楩有罪，廢為庶人：西平侯沐晟奏楩不法，廢為庶人，徙漳州。&lt;/ref&gt; As the rift between regional princes and the imperial court grew, the Prince of Yan, who commanded the most powerful military, effectively assumed the leadership role.

== Initial stage, 1399 ==

=== Attack on Beiping ===
[[File:Anonymous-Ming Chengzu.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Yongle Emperor]]]]

In December 1398, to prevent the potential attack from Prince of Yan, Jianwen Emperor appointed several imperial staff to [[Beiping]] (present day [[Beijing]]) where Zhu Di was stationed. In response, Zhu Di pretended to be ill while preparing for the anticipated war. However, the conspiracy was reported to the imperial staff in Beiping by one of the staff in Yan court.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: （六月）己酉，燕山百戶倪亮上變，告燕官校於諒、周鐸等陰事，詔逮至京師，皆戮之。復詔責燕王。王遂稱疾篤，佯狂走呼市中，奪酒食，語多妄亂，或臥土壤彌日不甦。張昺、謝貴入問疾，王盛夏圍爐播顫曰：「寒甚。」宮中亦杖而行。昺等稍信之，長史葛誠密語之曰：「王本無恙，公等勿懈。」&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the arrest for Prince of Yan was ordered by the imperial court. [[Zhang Xin (marquis)|Zhang Xin]], one of the imperial staff, decided to leak the imperial order to Prince of Yan.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 初，張信之至燕也，與昺等同受密旨，憂懼不知所出。以告母，母大驚曰：「吾聞燕都有王氣，王當爲天子。汝慎勿妄舉，取赤族禍也。」至是又密敕信，使執王，信見事急，三造燕邸，辭不見，乃乘婦人車徑至門，固請之。王召入，信拜牀下，密以情輸王。王猶佯為風疾，不能言，信曰：「殿下毋爾也。臣今奉詔禽王，王果無意，當就執，如有意，幸勿誨臣。」王察其誠，下拜曰：「生我一家者，子也！」於是召僧道衍謀舉兵。&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare for the imminent arrest, Zhu Di ordered his general [[Zhang Yu (general)|Zhang Yu]] to gather 800 men to patrol the Yan residence in Beiping.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 會昺等部署衛卒及屯田軍士，布列城中，一面飛章奏聞。布政司吏李有直竊其草，獻之府中，燕王亟呼護衛張玉、朱能等率壯士八百人入衛。&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, the imperial staff surrounded the Yan residence, and Zhu Di responded by executing the imperial staff and stormed the gates of Beiping.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 秋，七月，詔至，「逮燕府官屬」，於是張昺、謝貴等率諸衛士以兵圍府第，......壬申，王稱疾愈，御東殿，伏壯士左右及端禮門內，遣人召昺、貴，不至，復遣中使示以所逮姓名，乃至。......一時伏兵盡起，前禽昺、貴，捽葛誠、盧振下殿。王擲杖起曰：「我何病！為若輩奸臣所逼耳。」昺、貴及誠等不屈，皆斬之。&lt;/ref&gt; By nightfall, Zhu Di was in control of the city and officially rebelled against the imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 2: 是夜，（張）玉等攻九門，黎明已克其八，惟西直門未下。上令指揮唐雲解甲騎馬，導從如平時，過西直門，見闘者，呵之曰：「汝眾喧閧，欲何為者？誰令爾為此不義，是自取殺身耳。」眾聞雲言，皆散，乃盡克九門，遂下令安集城中，人民安堵，諸司官吏視事如故。北平都指揮使俞填走居庸關，馬瑄走薊州]]，宋忠率兵至居庸關，知事不齊，退保懷來，留俞填守居庸。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;《皇明祖訓•法律》：如朝無正臣，内有奸惡，則親王訓兵待命，天子密詔諸王，統領鎮兵討平之。&lt;/ref&gt; For the next several days, the Yan forces captured [[Tongzhou District, Beijing|Tongzhou]], [[Ji County, Tianjin|Jizhou]], [[Dunhua]] and [[Miyun]]. By the end of July, [[Juyong Pass]], [[Huailai]] and [[Qinhuangdao|Yongping]] all fell to the Yan forces and the entire Beiping area was effectively under Yan control.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 2: 甲戌，通州衛指揮房勝等率眾以城來歸。&lt;br /&gt;丙子，馬宣在薊州，謀起兵來攻。上遣指揮朱能等攻拔其城，遂生擒馬宣。遵化衛指揮蔣玉、密雲衛指揮郭亨各以城來歸。&lt;br /&gt;己卯，命指揮徐安、鐘祥、千戶徐祥等討填，安等攻破其城（居庸關），填走懷來，依宋忠。&lt;br /&gt;甲申，至懷來。......宋忠余眾蒼黃列陣未成，上麾師渡河，鼓噪直沖其陣，宋忠大敗，奔入城。......都指揮莊得單騎遁走，餘眾悉降，即散遣歸原衛。&lt;br /&gt;丙戌，永平守將趙彝、郭亮以城來歸。&lt;br /&gt;乙未，......乃作詒卜萬書，盛稱獎萬而極毀詆亨，緘識牢密，召一卒飲之酒，且厚賚之，而置書其衣中，俾歸與萬。其同獲之卒竊窺之，問守者曰：「彼何為者？」守者曰：「遣歸通意，故得厚賚。」卒跪曰：「告守者能為我請得偕行，惟命是從，不敢望賚。」守者如所言為請，遂俱遣而不與賚，不得賚者終不平，至即發其事。劉真、陳亨搜卒衣，得與卜萬書，遂疑萬，執下獄，籍其家。&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Yan forces captured Huailai, Prince of Gu fled to Nanjing from his territory in [[Zhangjiakou|Xuanfu]], which was situated near the Yan forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 壬辰，谷王橞聞燕兵破懷來，自宣府奔京師。&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the imperial order demanded that the Prince of Liao and Ning return to Nanjing.

== Government response, 1399–1400 ==

=== First offensive ===

In July 1399, the news of the rebellion had arrived in Nanjing. Jianwen Emperor ordered the removal of royal status from Prince of Yan and began to assemble an attack on Yan forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 棣反書聞。帝告太廟，削棣屬籍，廢為庶人。詔示天下。以（耿）炳文太祖時宿將，拜征虜大將軍。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 是月，燕王反書聞。齊泰請削燕屬籍，聲罪致討。或難之，泰曰：「明其為賊，敵乃可克。」遂定議伐燕，布告天下。&lt;/ref&gt; A headquarters for the expedition was set up in [[Zhending]], [[Hebei province]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Ming]]'',  Volume 142: 暴昭，潞州人。......燕兵起，設平燕布政司於真定，昭以尚書掌司事，與鐵鉉輩悉心經畫。&lt;/ref&gt;

Since many of the generals in the Ming court have either died or been purged by Zhu Yuanzhang, the lack of experienced military commanders was a major concern.&lt;ref&gt;According to ''[[History of Ming]]'', there were over 60 people granted nobility during the reign of Hongwu Emperor. By 1398, 35 of them died, and 26 of them were executed by Zhu Yuanzhang. The ones remaining were Geng Bingwen, Guo Ying and Yu Yuan.&lt;/ref&gt; With no other options, the 65-year-old [[Geng Bingwen]] was appointed as the commander and led 130,000 government forces north on an expedition against the Yan forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 炳文等瀕行，上戒之曰：「昔蕭繹舉兵入京，而令其下曰：『一門之內，自極兵威，不祥之甚。』今爾將士與燕王對壘，務體此意，毋使朕有殺叔父名。」&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August, the government forces arrived in Zhending.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 八月，己酉，耿炳文師次真定。&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare for the offensive, the forces were divided and stationed in [[Hejian]], [[Zhengzhou]] and [[Xiong County|Xiongxian]] separately. On 15 August, the Yan forces assaulted Xiongxian and Zhengzhou by surprise and captured both of the cities while annexing its forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 壬子，......，夜半，至雄縣，襲其城。（潘）忠援兵不至，前鋒麾下九千人皆戰沒。......命護衛千戶譚淵率壯士千餘，伏月漾橋水中，......，俟忠等援軍已過，即出據橋，王遣兵逆擊忠，敗之。&lt;br /&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 3: 上問忠等：“莫州軍馬幾何？”忠雲：“尚有戰士萬余、馬九千餘匹，今聞臣敗必走，急取可得也。”上率精銳百余為前鋒，趨鄚州，徑薄其營，悉降之，盡獲其人馬輜重。&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the generals in Geng Bingwen’s camp surrendered to Zhu Di and informed him of the positions of Geng Bingwen forces. Zhu Di instructed the general to return the message that the Yan forces were approaching soon, to convince Geng Bingwen to gather his forces together to prepare for the general attack.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 會炳文部將張保來降，言「炳文兵三十萬，先至者十三萬，分營滹沱河南北。」王厚撫保，遣歸，使詐言「被執得脫，且具陳雄、鄚敗狀，燕兵旦夕至。」......炳文聞保言，果移南營過河。&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August, the Yan forces arrived in [[Wuji County|Wujixian]]. Based on the information gathered from the locals and the surrendered troops, they began to prepare to raid the government forces.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 3: 壬戌，未至真定二十裡，獲采樵者，詢知炳文軍惟備西北，其東南無備。上率三騎先至東門，突入其運糧車中，擒二人問之，其南岸之營果移於北岸，由西門而營，直抵西山。&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yan forces launched a surprise raid on Geng Bingwen the next day, and a full-scale battle ensued. Zhu Di personally led a strike force against the flank of government forces, and Geng Bingwen suffered a crushing defeat as a result. Over 3000 men surrendered to the Yan forces, and the remainder of the government forces fled back to Zhending. General [[Gu Cheng]] surrendered to Zhu Di.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 炳文出城逆戰，張玉、譚淵、朱能等率眾奮擊，王以奇兵出其背，循城夾攻，橫衝其陣，炳文大敗，奔還。朱能與敢死士三十餘騎，追奔至滹沱河東。炳文眾尚數萬，復列陣向能。能奮勇大呼，衝入炳文陣，南軍披靡，蹂藉死者甚眾，棄甲降者三千餘人。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 3: 上將輕騎數十，繞出城西，先破其二營。適炳文送使客出，覺之奔還，......炳文出城迎戰，張玉、譚淵、朱能、馬雲等率眾奮擊之，上以奇兵出其背，循城夾擊，橫透敵陣，炳文大敗，急奔入城。軍爭門，門塞不得入，相蹈藉死者甚眾，乃自相斮，然後得入而闔門自守。丘福等殺入子城，門閉乃退。其左副將軍駙馬都尉李堅領眾接戰，我騎士薛祿引槊刺堅墜馬，揮刀斫之。堅大呼曰：「我李駙馬也，勿殺。」祿生擒之，其右副將軍都督甯忠、左軍都督顧成、都指揮劉遂俱被擒，斬首三萬餘級，積屍塞城壕，溺死滹沱河者無算，獲馬二萬餘匹，俘降數萬，盡散遣之，有二千人願留不歸，上從之。&lt;/ref&gt; For the next several days, the Yan forces attempted to capture Zhending but were unable to succeed. On 29 August, the Yan forces withdrew back to Beiping.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 3: 丙寅，攻真定二日未下。上曰：「攻城下策，徒曠時日，鈍士氣。」遂命班師。&lt;/ref&gt; Gu Cheng were sent back to Beiping to assist [[Hongxi Emperor|Zhu Gaochi]] with the defense of the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: （顧）成遂降，王遣人送北平，輔世子居守。&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second offensive ===

As the news of Geng Bingwen's defeat reached back to Nanjing, the Jianwen Emperor was starting to grow concerned about the war. [[Li Jinglong]] was proposed by Huang Zicheng as the new commander, and the proposal was accepted despite of opposition from Qi Tai.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 上聞真定之敗，始有憂色，謂黃子澄曰：「柰何！」對曰：「勝敗兵家之常，無足慮。」因薦曹國公李景隆可大任，齊泰極言其不可，竟用之。&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August, Li Jinglong led a total of 500,000 men and advanced to [[Hejian]].&lt;ref name="government number"&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 4: （九月）戊寅，諜報曹國公乘傳至德州，收集耿炳文敗亡將卒并調各處軍馬五十萬，進營河間。&lt;/ref&gt; As the news reached the Yan camp, Zhu Di was certain of a Yan victory by outlining the weakness of Li Jinglong.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 4:上語諸將曰：「李九江（李景隆小名），豢養之子，寡謀而驕矜，色厲而中餒，忌刻而自用，況未嘗習兵，見戰陣而輙以五十萬付之，是自坑之矣。漢高祖大度知人，善任使，英雄為用，不過能將十萬，九江何等才而能將五十萬？趙括之敗可待矣。」&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 4: 上笑曰：「兵法有五敗，景隆皆蹈之。為將政令不脩，紀律不整，上下異心，死生離志，一也；今北地早寒，南卒裘褐不足，披冒霜雪，手足皸瘃，甚者墮指，又士無贏糧，馬無宿槁，二也；不量險易，深入趨利，三也；貪而不治，智信不足，氣盈而愎，仁勇俱無，威令不行，三軍易撓，四也；部曲喧嘩，金鼓無節，好諛喜佞，專任小人，五也。九江五敗悉備，保無能為。然吾在此，必不敢至，今須往援永平，彼知我出，必來攻城，回師擊之，堅城在前，大軍在後，必成擒矣。」&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Defense of Beiping ====

On 1 September, government forces from [[Liaodong]] began to lay siege to the city of [[Qinhuangdao|Yongping]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 4: 九月戊辰朔，永平守將郭亮馳報：江陰侯吳高、都督耿瓛等以遼東兵圍城。&lt;/ref&gt; Zhu Di led the Yan forces to reinforce the city on 19 September and defeated the Liaodong forces by 25 September. Following the victory, Zhu Di decided to raid the city of [[Ningcheng County|Daning]] controlled by Prince of Ning in order to annex his army.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 4: 丙戌，上率師援永平，諸將請曰：「必守盧溝橋，扼李景隆之沖，使不得徑至地城下。」上曰：「天寒冰涸，隨處可度，守一橋何足拒敵？舍之不守，以驕敵心，使深入受困於堅城之下，此兵法所謂利而誘之者也。」壬辰，吳高等聞上至，倉卒盡棄輜重，走山海。上遣輕騎追之，斬首數千級，俘降亦數千人，盡散遣之。上議攻大寧，......乙未，師行。上諭世子嚴守備，敵至，慎毋與戰。&lt;/ref&gt; The Yan forces reached Daning on 6 October, and Zhu Di went inside the city.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 4: 壬寅，師抵大寧，城中不虞我軍驟至，倉卒關門拒守。上引數騎循繞其城，適至西南隅而城崩，上麾勇士先登，眾蟻附而上，遂克之，獲都指揮房寬，撫綏其眾，頃刻而定，城中肅然無擾。遣陳亨家奴並城中將士家屬報亨，劉真等引軍來援，軍士聞家屬無恙，皆解甲。時寧王權三護衛為朝廷削奪者尚留城中，至是皆歸附，上悉以還寧王。&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to coerce the Prince of Ning and the troops in Daning to submit to him, and the strength of the Yan forces increased significantly.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 壬寅，燕師至大寧。王單騎入城，詭言窮蹙求救，執寧王手大慟。寧王信之，為草表謝，請赦其死。居數日，情好甚洽。時北平銳卒伏城外，吏士得稍稍入城，陰結三衛部長及戍卒。己酉，燕王辭去，寧王祖之郊外，伏兵起，擁寧王行，三衛彍騎及諸戍卒一呼畢集。守將朱鑑不能禦，力戰死，寧府長史石撰不屈死。壬子，燕師南還，寧王同行，寧妃、世子皆從，悉以三衛配北軍，大寧城為之一空。&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon learning that Zhu Di is away in Daning, the government forces led by Li Jinglong crossed [[Marco Polo Bridge|Lugou Bridge]] and began to attack Beiping. However, Zhu Gaochi was able to hold off the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 4： 李景隆聞上征大寧，果引軍度盧溝橋，意氣驕盈，有輕視之志，以鞭擊馬韂曰：「不守盧溝橋，吾知其無能為矣。」直薄城下，築櫐九門，遣別將攻通州。時世子嚴肅部署，整肴守備，城中晏然，數乘機遣勇士縋城夜斫景隆營，殺傷甚眾，營中驚擾，有自相蹂踐而者。景隆攻麗正門急，時城中婦女皆乘城擲瓦石擊之，其勢益沮。&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, the government forces almost  broke into the city, but the attack was held back by a suspicious Li Jinglong.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Siku Quanshu]] version of ''[[History of Ming]]'', Volume 142: 瞿能傳「與其子帥精騎千餘攻張掖門」，臣方煒按：《明書》-{云}-：「能從李景隆攻北平，力戰，勢甚銳，與其子獨帥精騎千餘人殺入彰義門。」彰義門，金之西門，元所謂南城也，今之廣寧門；人猶呼為彰義。外城雖建於嘉靖時，意金城故址在明初猶存，使作張掖，音轉之訛耳。疑即彰義他書，但無可證，謹識闕疑。&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Battle of Baigou River ====

In April 1400, Li Jinglong mobilized 600,000 men and began advancing northwards toward the Baigou River. On 24 April, the Yan forces engaged with the government forces in a decisive battle.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 乙卯，燕師渡玉馬河，營於蘇家橋。&lt;/ref&gt;
The government forces ambushed Zhu Di, and the Yan forces suffered a series of defeats initially.

On 27 April, the Yan forces began marching toward Dezhou to lay the city to siege. The Yan forces captured Dezhou on 9 May, and Li Jinglong was forced to flee to [[Jinan]].

=== Battle of Jinan ===

[[File:济南大明湖公园铁公祠.JPG|thumb|120px|Temple of [[Tie Xuan]] in [[Daming Lake]], Jinan]]

As the city of Jinan was under siege by the Yan forces, the defenders led by [[Tie Xuan]] and [[Sheng Yong]] refused to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 燕師遂圍濟南，鉉與庸等乘城守禦。王知不可驟克，令射書城中趣降。&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 May, the Yan forces diverted the river to flood the city.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 6: 辛巳，隄水灌濟南城。&lt;/ref&gt; Tie Xuan pretended to surrender and lured Zhu Di to the city gate.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 鉉乃佯令守陴（牆頭）者皆哭，撤守具，遣千人出城詐降。王大喜，軍中懽呼。鉉設計，預懸鐵板城門上，伏壯士闉堵（甕城）中，候燕王入，下板擊之，又設伏，斷城外橋以遏歸師。&lt;/ref&gt; As Zhu Di approached the city gate, he was ambushed by the government forces and fled back to the camp. The siege continued for the next three months.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 比王入門中，人呼千歲，鐵板下稍急，傷燕王馬首。王驚覺，易馬而馳。伏發，橋倉猝不可斷，王鞭馬自橋逸去，憤甚，復設長圍攻之。鉉隨宜守禦，燕師持久頓城下者凡三閱月，卒不能下。&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic important of Jinan was crucial, and Zhu Di was determined to capture the city. After suffering several setbacks during the siege, Zhu Di turned to the use of [[cannon]]s. In response, the defenders resorted to placing several plaques written with the name of Zhu Yuanzhang, father of Zhu Di, on top of the city walls. Zhu Di was forced to stop the bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 初，燕王之攻真定也，三日不下，即解兵去。惟自以得濟南足以斷南北道，即不下金陵，畫疆自守，亦足以徐圖江、淮，故乘此大破景隆之銳，盡力攻之，期於必拔。不意鉉等屢挫其鋒，又令守陴者詈燕，燕王益憤，乃以大炮攻城。城中不支，鉉書高皇帝神牌，懸之城上，燕師不敢擊。&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Jianwen Emperor dispatched an envoy to negotiate for peace, but it was rejected by Zhu Di.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 六月，上聞濟南危急，用齊泰、黃子澄計，遣使赦燕罪以緩其師。己酉，命尚寶丞李得成詣燕師，諭王罷兵。王不聽，留之，得成遂附於燕。&lt;/ref&gt; The government reinforcements arrived in [[Hejian]] around July, and disrupted the supply line of the Yan forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 秋，七月，都督平安將兵二十萬，進次河間之單家橋，謀出御河，斷燕餉道。&lt;/ref&gt; With the supply line threatened, Zhu Di was forced to withdraw back to Beiping on 16 August.

=== Battle of Dongchang ===

In October 1400, Zhu Di was informed that the government forces were marching northwards, and decided to launch a preemptive strike on Cangzhou. Departing from [[Tongzhou District, Beiping|Tongzhou]] on 25 October, the Yan forces reached Cangzhou by 27 October and captured the city in two days.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 7: 丙午，下令征遼東。......壬子，密令徐理、陳旭等朱詣直沽，造浮橋濟師。丙辰，移師還通州，循河而南。......戊午，我軍過直沽。上語諸將曰：「徐凱等所設備，惟青縣、長盧而已，塼垛兒、灶兒坡數程皆無水，皆不備，趨此可徑至滄州城不？」是夜二更，啟行，晝夜三百裡，敵兩發哨騎皆不相遇。明旦，至監倉，遇敵哨騎數百，盡擒之。食時，至滄州，敵猶未覺，督軍士築城。我軍既至城下，始蒼黃分，守城垛眾皆股栗，不及擐甲。我軍四面急攻之，上麾壯士由城之東北角登，逾時拔其城。而先已遣人斷敵歸路，遂斬首萬餘級，獲馬九十餘匹，而生擒都督徐凱、程暹、都指揮俞琪、趙滸、胡原、李英、張傑並指揮以下百余人，餘眾悉降，咸給牒遣。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 丙辰，自通州循河而南，渡直沽，晝夜兼行。戊午，師至滄州城下，凱等方四出伐木，晝夜築城，倉猝收筑具出戰。燕師四面攻之，張玉率壯士由城東北隅肉薄而登，庚申，拔之。&lt;/ref&gt; The Yan forces crossed the river and arrived in Dezhou on 4 November.&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 棣自長蘆渡河，至德州。&lt;/ref&gt; Zhu Di attempted to summon Sheng Yong to surrender, but was refused.

The news of victory following the Battle of Dongchang was well received by Jianwen Emperor.

The defeat at Dongchang was a humiliating loss for Zhu Di, but his close advisor [[Yao Guangxiao]] supported to continue military operations.&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 棣恥東昌之敗，意殆欲稍休，道衍力趣之。謂棣曰：臣前言師行必克，但費兩日；兩日者，昌字也，自此全勝矣。&lt;/ref&gt; The Yan forces mobilised again on 16 February 1401 and marched southwards.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 7: 二月庚寅朔。戊戌，命僧修齋，薦陣亡將士，上親為文祭之。祭畢，上流涕言曰：「奸惡橫加毒害於我，爾等憫我無辜，奮力戰鬥，為我而死，含無窮之冤於地下。每念及之，痛切於心。」遂脫所服袍，焚于前，諸將趨進，亟止之。......乙巳，上率師南出&lt;/ref&gt;

In anticipation of a Yan strike, Sheng Yong stationed himself in Dezhou with 200,000 troops, while placing the remainder of the forces in [[Zhengding County|Zhending]]. Zhu Di decided to strike Sheng Yong first.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 乙巳，燕師復南下。己酉，次保定。盛庸合諸軍二十萬駐德州，吳傑、平安出真定。燕王與諸將議所向，丘福等請攻定州，王曰：「野戰易，攻城難。今盛庸在德州，吳傑、平安在真定，我若頓兵城下，彼必合勢來援。堅城在前，強敵在後，此危道也。今真定距德州二百餘里（注：真定即石家莊附近，離德州約四百里，應是記載有誤），我軍介其中，敵必出迎戰，取其一軍，餘自膽破。」諸將曰：「腹背受敵，奈何？」王曰：「百里之外，勢不相及，兩軍相薄，勝敗在呼吸間，雖百步不能相救，況二百里哉！」明日，遂移軍東出&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March, the Yan forces encountered the forces of Sheng Yong in Jia River near [[Wuyi County, Hebei|Wuyi]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 7: （三月）己卯，偵知盛庸軍營夾河，遂進師迫之。庚辰，距敵營四十裡駐兵。&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 March, the Yan forces crossed the Jia River. Seeing that the camp of Sheng Yong was heavily guarded, Zhu Di decided to personally scout the opponent to search for weak spots. Since Jianwen Emperor forbade the killing of Zhu Di, the government forces refrained from shooting at Zhu Di as he scouted around with minimal harassment.&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 棣將輕騎來覘，掠陣過，庸遣千騎追之。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Those Ming Dynasty Stuff''Volume 1: 然而朱棣並未接近自己所佈陣型，而是從旁掠過，很明顯他的目的是偵察。然而此時盛庸終於發現，自己並不能把朱棣怎麼樣！對付這種偵察騎兵，最好的方法就是給他一槍，把他打下馬來，然而皇帝陛下的教導始終縈繞在耳邊，無論如何是不能開槍或者射箭的，因為那會讓仁慈的皇帝陛下擔負殺害叔叔的罪名。......他只能派出自己的騎兵去追擊對方，結果當然是不了了之。&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuing battle lasted until the nightfall, in which both sides suffered an equal number of casualties.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 辛巳，庸軍及燕兵遇於夾河。庸結陣甚堅，陣旁火車銳弩齊列。燕王以輕騎掠陣過，庸追卻之，乃復以步騎攻其左掖，不能入。燕將譚淵，從中軍望見塵起，遽出兵逆擊之。都指揮莊得，率眾殊死戰，遂合庸軍，斬淵及其部下董真保於陣。燕王與朱能、張武等，復以勁騎繞出南軍背，乘暮掩擊，莊得陷陣死，又殺楚智、張皂旗。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 是日戰酣，殺傷皆相當。&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides engaged again the next day. After several hours of intense fighting, the wind suddenly started to blow from the northeast to southwest toward the government positions.

After the defeat of Sheng Yong in Jia River, the Yan forces advanced to Zhending. Zhu Di managed to lure the government forces out of the city and engaged them in Gaocheng on 9 March. Facing the gunpowder weapons and crossbows utilised by the government forces, the Yan Army suffered heavy losses.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 7: 是日，軍士四出取糧，又令校尉荷擔抱嬰兒，偽作避兵者，奔入真定城，揚言北軍皆出取糧，營中無備。傑等聞而信之，遂出軍襲我。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: （閏三月）戊戌，遇燕師於藳城。傑等列方陣於西南，燕王謂諸將曰：「方陣四面受敵，豈能取勝！我以精兵攻其一隅，一隅敗則其餘自潰矣。」乃以軍縻其三面，而自率精銳攻東北隅。燕將薛祿，出入敵陣，馬蹶，為南軍所執，奪敵刀斬數人，復跳而免。王復率驍騎循滹沱河出陣後，傑、安等預藏火器，發大弩射王，矢集王所建旗，勢如猬毛，燕師中火器及弩，死傷甚眾，竟不及王。&lt;/ref&gt; The battle ensued the next day, and a severe wind started to blow. The government forces were unable to hold on to its position and were crushed by the Yan forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 會大風起，發屋拔樹，燕軍乘之，傑等師大潰。燕王麾兵四向蹙之，斬首六萬餘級。追奔至真定城下，傑等走入城。&lt;/ref&gt;

From Baigou River to Jia River and Gaocheng, the Yan forces were aided by the wind in all of these occasions. Zhu Di was convinced that the Yan forces were destined for victory.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 燕師自白溝河至藳城，凡三捷，皆得風助，王以為此天授，非人力也。&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ensuing battles ===

In the immediate aftermath of Battle of Jia River-Gaocheng, the Yan forces took the advantage and marched southwards with no resistance.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 己酉，燕師掠順德。辛亥，掠廣平。癸丑，次大名。諸郡縣皆望風降燕。&lt;/ref&gt; Zhu Di demanded for peace talks, and Jianwen Emperor consulted with advisor [[Fang Xiaonu]] for opinions. Fang Xiaonu suggested to pretend to negotiate while ordering the forces in Liaodong to strike Beiping.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 王聞罷齊、黃以為緩兵之計，復上書曰：「比聞奸臣竄逐，臣亦將休兵就藩。而吳傑、平安、盛庸之眾，猶聚境上，是奸臣雖出而其計實行，臣不敢奉詔。」&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 8: 書至，建文君以示方孝孺。孝孺觀畢，曰：「我方將怠之，此奏之來正宜。今各處兵已多集，獨雲南兵來至，燕軍久駐大名，暑雨為沴，不戰將自困。今調遼東兵攻永平，德州擾北平，根本受敵，彼必歸援，我大軍躡其後，有必擒之勢矣。今辜遣人報之，往復一二月，吾師必集矣。」建文君善其策，遂命孝孺草詔，宣言欲罷兵。......遂令大理少卿薛嵓齎至軍中密散之，以懈我將士心。&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy did not work as planned, and in May Sheng Yong sent out an army to attack the supply line of the Yan Army.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 嵓至見燕王，王問：「上意云何？」嵓曰：「朝廷言殿下旦釋甲，暮即旋師。」王曰：此不可紿三尺兒。嵓惶懼不能對。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 8: 五月己丑朔，吳傑、平安、盛庸俱發兵擾我餉道。&lt;/ref&gt; Zhu Di claimed that Sheng Yong refused to stop military actions with ill intentions, and managed to convince Jianwen Emperor to imprison Sheng Yong.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 己丑，燕王復使指揮武勝詣京師上書，謂：「朝廷已許罷兵，而庸等攻北，絕我糧餉，與詔旨相違，此必有主之者。」上得書，欲竟罷之。孝孺曰：「兵一罷不可復聚，若使彼長驅犯闕，何以禦之？」上從其言，乃下武勝於獄。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 帝乃誅勝以絕燕。&lt;/ref&gt;

As both sides ceased to negotiate, Zhu Di decided to raid the supply line of the government forces to starve the defenders in Dezhou. On 15 June, the Yan forces successfully destroyed the main food storage of the government forces in [[Pei County|Pei]], and Dezhou was on the brink of collapse.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 8: 辛酉，獲其諜者，言武勝等已下獄。上謂諸將曰：「我駐軍於此三月，以俟息兵之命。武勝既執，則其志不可轉矣，我豈能塊然坐此，為人所擒哉？彼軍萃德州，資糧皆通徐、沛來，但調輕騎數千邀而毀之，德州無所仰給，必困，縱欲求戰，我嚴師待之，以逸擊勞，以飽擊餓，有必勝之道，勝之而後求息兵，或冀能從。」諸將皆曰：「善。」遂遣李遠等率騎兵六千擾其餉道，上令遠軍皆易彼甲胄，使遙見不疑，又恐臨戰相雜難辨，令各插柳枝一握於背為識。......壬申，李遠等如上旨，至濟甯穀亭沙河，沛縣敵望之，皆不覺。我軍焚其糧舟數百艘，糧數百萬石，軍資器械不可勝計，河水盡熱，魚鱉皆浮死，其運糧軍士盡散走。京師大震，而德州兵氣稍索矣。&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the Yan forces captured [[Pengde]] and Linxian.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 秋，七月，己丑，燕師掠彰德。......丙申，燕師陷林縣。&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 July, government forces from Zhending launched a raid on Beiping.

Despite of numerous victories, the Yan forces were unable to hold on to territories due to lack of manpower.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 當是時，王稱兵已三年矣，親戰陣，冒矢石，為士卒先，常乘勝逐北，然亦屢瀕於危。所克城邑，兵去旋復為朝廷守，所據僅北平、保定、永平三郡而已。&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yan offensives, 1401–1402 ==

=== Advancing south ===

By the winter of 1401, Zhu Di decided to alter the general offensive strategy. The Yan forces were to skip the strongholds of the government forces, and advance straight south toward the [[Yangtze River]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 有以中官奉使侵暴為言者，詔所在有司繫治，於是中官密遣人赴燕，具言京師空虛可取狀。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 會詔有司繫治中官奉使之不法者，先後奔燕，具言京師空虛可取狀，王乃慨然曰：「頻年用兵，何時已乎？要當臨江一決，不復反顧矣！」道衍亦力勸燕王：「毋下城邑，疾趨京師，此批亢擣虛之策也。」遂定計。&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December, the Yan forces mobilised and began advancing southward. In the month of January, the Yan forces stormed across [[Shandong]] and captured [[Dong'e County|Dong'e]], [[Dongping County|Dongping]], [[Wenshang County|Wenshang]] and [[Pei County|Pei]]. On 30 January 1402, the Yan forces reached [[Xuzhou]], the major transportation hub.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 8: （十二月）乙卯朔。&lt;br /&gt;丙寅，上率師南征。&lt;br /&gt;壬午，駐師蠡縣。&lt;br /&gt;四年正月甲申朔。&lt;br /&gt;乙未，由館陶度河。&lt;br /&gt;丁丑，師至東阿舊縣，攻城不下，力戰拔之，斬首三千餘級，生擒其守將。&lt;br /&gt;戊戌，攻拔東平，擒指揮詹璟。&lt;br /&gt;庚子，攻拔汶上，擒指揮薛鵬。&lt;br /&gt;庚戌，師至沛縣，守將以城降，知縣顏伯偉不出，為我軍所殺。&lt;br /&gt;癸丑，師至徐州。&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the mobilisation of the Yan forces, Jianwen Emperor ordered [[Mei Ying]] to defend [[Huai'an]], and ordered [[Xu Huizu]] to reinforce Shandong.&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 冬十二月，詔駙馬都尉梅殷鎮淮安。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 建文四年春正月，甲申，召故周王橚於蒙化，居之京師。命魏國公徐輝祖率京軍往援山東。&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February, the government forces in Xuzhou refused to engage with the Yan forces to focus on defending the city after suffering a defeat.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 甲戌，燕師攻徐州，城中兵出戰，敗績，閉城而守。&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battle of Lingbi ===

Zhu Di decided to skip Xuzhou and continued to advance southward. The Yan forces went past [[Suzhou, Anhui|Suzhou]], defended by [[Pin An]], and reached [[Bengbu]] by 9 March.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 三月，甲申，燕師趨宿州。壬辰，次渦河。&lt;/ref&gt; Ping An pursued the Yan forces but was ambushed by Zhu Di at Fei River on 14 March, which forced the Pin An to retreat back to Suzhou.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 丁酉，平安率步騎四萬躡燕軍。燕王設伏於淝河，命都指揮[[王真]]與[[白義]]、[[劉江]]各率百騎逆之，緣路設伏。安兵將至，真誘之戰，，束草置囊中如束帛狀，遇安軍，擲而餌之，安軍士競取囊。燕師伏發，真率壯士直前，斬馘無算。後軍不繼，安軍圍之數匝，遂斬真。真夙稱驍將，身被重創，猶格殺數十人，燕王嘗曰：「諸將奮勇如王真，何事不成！」聞其死，自率兵迎戰。安部將和爾和（火耳灰）挺槊大呼，直前刺王，馬忽蹶，為燕所禽。安軍乃卻，退屯宿州。&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March, Zhu Di dispatched an army to disrupt the supply line of Xuzhou.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 丙午，燕王遣將譚清率兵斷徐州餉道，以平安駐宿州為持久計，斷其糧餉，可不攻而自潰也。清至徐州擊轉餉兵，大破之，還至大店，為南軍所圍。燕軍望見旗幟，亟馳赴援，鐵鉉擊卻之。和爾和之被禽也，燕王令入宿衛。至是從王，欲立功自贖，乃以身翼王，殺南軍數十人，圍解，遁去。&lt;/ref&gt; The Yan forces arrived at the [[Sui River]] on 14 April, and settled across the river facing the government camp. A battle broke out on 22 April in which the government forces led by [[Xu Yaozu]] were victorious.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 夏，四月，丙寅，燕師次於睢水之小河，燕王令陳文扼要處為橋以濟。丁卯，平安列陣爭橋，會何福軍亦至，張左右翼，緣河而東，擊敗燕軍，遂斬陳文於陣。安轉戰至北坂，橫槊刺王，幾及之，燕番將王琪，躍馬入陣掖燕王，得脫。南軍奪橋而北，勇氣百倍。燕將張武率勇敢士自林間突出，與王騎合，擊卻之。於是南軍駐橋南，北軍駐橋北，相持者數日，南軍糧盡。燕王曰：「更待一二日，南軍饟稍集，未易攻也。」乃留兵千餘守橋，而潛移諸軍輜重去南營三十里，夜半，渡河繞出南軍後，安等大驚。而徐輝祖之援兵適至，甲戌，與燕兵大戰於齊眉山，自午至酉，南軍輒勝，斬燕驍將李斌。&lt;/ref&gt; As the government forces had victories one after another, the military morale of the Yan forces started to plummet. Soldiers of the Yan forces were mostly from the north, and they were unaccustomed to the heat as summertime approaches. The generals of Zhu Di proposed a withdrawal to regroup, in which Zhu Di rejected.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 維時王師再捷，燕人兇懼。會淮土暑濕薰蒸，北軍疾疫，乙亥，燕諸將請渡河，擇地休息士馬，俟釁而動。燕王曰：「兵事有進無退。」乃下令：「欲渡河者左，不欲者右。」諸將多趨左，王怒曰：「任公等自為之！」朱能曰：「諸軍勉旃！漢高十戰而九不勝，卒有天下。況敵已饑疲，邀其餉道，可以坐困。利已在我，豈可有退心！」諸將乃不復言。&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the imperial court received rumours that the Yan forces have retreated back north. Jianwen Emperor recalled Xu Yaozu back to Nanjing, which reduced the government strength in north of the Yangtze River.&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 而帝聞訛言，謂燕兵已北，召輝祖還。福軍遂孤。&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 April, the government forces moved the camp to Lingbi and began to set up fortifications.

The break out signal was decided as three shots of cannon fire. On the next day, the Yan forces happened to attack Lingbi fortification with the same signal. The government forces completely collapsed in a state of confusion as the Yan forces stormed to take over and ended the battle.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 9, Part I: 庚辰，何福等先與我軍相對，深溝高壘，欲運糧實其中，為持久計。至是，軍敗糧乏，眾心離貳，乃下令期明旦聞炮三震，即出走，約聚淮河就糧。辛巳，上命諸軍攻敵營壘，而躬率諸將先登，軍士蟻附而上。我軍三震炮，敵眾誤為己炮，急趨門走，門塞不得出，營中紛擾，人馬墜濠塹皆滿，破其營，生擒敵將左副總兵都督陳暉、右副總兵都督平安、右參將都督馬溥、都督徐真、都指揮孫成等三十七員、內官四員、禮部侍郎陳性善、大理寺丞彭典明、欽天監副劉伯完、指揮王貴等一百五十員，獲馬二萬餘匹，降者無算，悉縱遣，歡聲動地曰：「吾屬自此獲安矣。」何福單騎脫走。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 於是南軍糧乏，乃下令，期以明日聞礮聲三，即突圍出，就糧於淮河。辛巳，燕師攻靈壁壘，發三礮，令軍士蟻附而登。福軍誤以為己號，爭門走，燕師乘之，人馬擾亂，遂大潰。指揮宋瑄，力戰死之。福單騎走免，安及陳暉、馬溥、徐真、孫成等三十七人皆被執。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 諸將請移駐淮河就糧，夜令軍中聞三礮即走。翌日，燕兵猝薄壘，亦發礮三。福軍以為己礮也，爭趨門出。燕兵乘之，遂大亂，人馬墜壕塹俱滿。福單騎走，安及都督陳暉、侍郎陳性善等三十七人皆被執。&lt;/ref&gt;

The main strength the government forces were crushed decisively in the Battle of Lingbi, and the Yan forces were now unmatched in the north of Yangtze River.

=== Fall of Nanjing ===

After the Battle of Lingbi, the Yan forces advanced straight toward the southeast and captured [[Si County|Sizhou]] on 7 May.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 己丑，燕師下泗州。王謁祖陵，賜父老牛酒。&lt;/ref&gt; Sheng Yong attempted to set up a defense line in the Huai River to prevent the Yan forces from crossing. As the attack was halted in Huai’an, Zhu Di divided the army and launched a converging attack on Sheng Yong. Sheng Yong was defeated, and the Yan forces captured [[Xuyi County|Xuyi]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 盛庸獨軍而南，以兵數萬、戰艦數千列淮南岸，棣兵不得渡。遣使至淮安，假道於駙馬都尉梅殷，殷劓其使，曰：「留汝口，還為而王言君臣大義。」棣氣沮。鳳陽守徐安，亦折浮橋絕舟楫以遏燕。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 9, Part I: 辛卯，敵將盛庸領馬步兵數萬、戰艦數千艘列淮之南岸，我軍列北岸相對。上命將士艤舟編筏，揚旗鼓噪，指麾若將度河者，敵望之有慎色。上別遣丘福、朱能等將驍勇數百人西行二十里，以小舟潛濟，漸近敵營舉炮，敵驚愕，福等突沖敵陣，敵眾棄戈甲而走，盛庸股戰不能上馬，其下掖之登舟，遂單舸脫走，我師盡獲其戰艦，遂濟淮，駐南岸。是日，克盱眙。&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May, the Yan forces marched toward [[Yangzhou]], and the city surrendered on one week later.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 癸巳，燕師趨揚州。己亥，至天長，遣使招諭揚州守將王禮。先是，禮聞燕師至，謀以城降。監察御史王彬巡江淮治揚州，與指揮崇剛嬰城堅守，晝夜不解甲，知禮有異謀，執之，與其黨俱繫獄。有力士，能舉千斤，彬常以自隨，禮弟崇者，厚賂力士母，呼其子出。會彬解甲而浴，為千戶徐政、張勝所縛，遂出禮於獄，開門降。彬與剛皆不屈死。庚子，燕師克揚州。&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby city of [[Gaoyou]] also surrendered soon after.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 9, Part I: 壬寅，高郵等衛指揮王傑等率眾詣軍門降。&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall of Yangzhou was a devastating blow for the government forces, as the imperial capital Nanjing is now exposed to a direct attack. After discussing with [[Fang Xiaoru]], the Jianwen Emperor decided to negotiate again with Zhu Di to delay the attack while calling for help from other provinces.&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 徵天下兵勤王。......下罪己詔，遣慶成郡主詣燕軍。&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby provinces of [[Suzhou]], [[Ningbo]] and [[Huizhou]] all dispatched an army to protect the imperial capital.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 壬寅，詔天下勤王，遣御史大夫練子寧、右侍中黃觀、修撰王叔英等分道徵兵，召齊泰、黃子澄還。於是蘇州知府姚善、寧波知府王璡、徽州知府陳彥回、樂平知縣張彥方、前永清典史周縉等，先後入衛。&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May, Zhu Di rejected the negotiation for armistice.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 9, Part I: 孝孺言：「乃事急矣，宜以計稍緩之。」建文君曰：「何計？」曰：「曷遣人許以割地，稽延數日，東南召募壯丁，當畢集天塹之險，北軍不長於舟楫，相與決戰江上，勝敗未知。」建文君善其言，乃遣慶城郡主度江至軍門，白其事。郡主，上之從姊也。......（朱棣）又曰：「此奸臣欲姑緩我，以俟遠方之兵耳。我豈為其所欺哉？」郡主默然，遂辭歸。&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June, the Yan forces were about to cross the Yangtze River, but was met with firm resistance from Sheng Yong.

Zhu Gaoxu arrived with reinforcement in a decisive moment and crushed the forces of Sheng Yong.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 六月，癸丑朔，燕師將渡江，盛庸扼之於浦子口，敗之。燕王欲且議和北還，適高煦引兵至，王仗鉞拊其背曰：「勉之！世子多疾。」於是煦率眾殊死戰，庸兵失利，退屯高資港。&lt;/ref&gt; During the preparation for river crossing, the Yan forces obtained several warships from the government navy.

By 8 June, the Yan forces advanced to 30&amp;nbsp;km east of Nanjing.

== Aftermath ==

As the Yan forces marched into Nanjing, Jianwen Emperor set the imperial palace on fire in despair. While the body of [[Empress Ma (Jianwen)|Empress Ma]] was located afterwards, the body of Jianwen Emperor had vanished and was never found.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 上知事不可為，縱火焚宮，馬后死之。傳言「帝自地道出，翰林院編修程濟、御史葉希賢等凡四十餘人從。」&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 王既入，遣中使出馬后屍於火，詭言帝屍，持之泣，曰：「癡兒，何至是！」&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor was alleged to have escaped through the tunnels and went into hiding.&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 宮中火起，帝不知所終。棣遣中使出后屍於火，詭云帝屍。越八日，用學士王景言，備禮葬之。然葬地所在，後無聞焉。或曰帝由地道出亡，其後滇黔巴蜀間，皆傳有帝為僧時往來跡，世遂以帝為遜國云。&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhu Di decided to go on and hold an imperial funeral for the emperor to imply his death to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 壬申，葬建文皇帝，蓋馬后也。上以葬禮詢之王景，對曰：「當以天子之禮葬。」從之。&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June, Zhu Di was crowned at the imperial palace and became the Yongle Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ming Shilu|Taizong Shilu]]'', Volume 9, Part II: 己巳，上謁孝陵，欷歔感慕，悲不能止。禮畢，攬轡回營，諸王及文武群臣備法駕，奉寶璽，迎上於道，遮上馬不得行。上固拒再言，諸王及文武群臣擁上登輦，軍民耆老，萬眾夾道，俯歡呼，連稱萬歲。上不得已升輦，曰：「諸王群臣以為我奉宗廟宜，莫如予。宗廟事重，予不足，今為眾心所載，予辭弗獲，強循眾志，然宜協心輔予不逮。」遂詣奉天殿，即皇帝位，諸王暨文武群臣上表稱賀。&lt;/ref&gt; All of the Jianwen policies were reversed to the original policies set during the reign of Hongwu Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 12: 是月（建文二年正月），詔均江浙田賦。初，太祖屢蠲蘇、松、嘉、湖極重田畝，至是復諭戶部減免，畝不得過一斗。迨革除后，浙西賦復重云。&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June, Qi Tai, Huang Zicheng and Fang Xiaoru were all executed, and their families [[Nine familial exterminations|exterminated]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ming Tongjian'', Volume 13: 丁丑，殺兵部尚書齊泰、太常寺卿黃子澄、文學博士方孝孺，皆夷其族。&lt;/ref&gt; Various other imperial advisors to the Jianwen Emperor were either executed or committed suicide, and their families were exiled by the new government.&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Ming]]'', Volume 141: 贊曰：帝王成事，蓋由天授。成祖之得天下，非人力所能禦也。齊、黃、方、練之儔，抱謀國之忠，而乏制勝之策。然其忠憤激發，視刀鋸鼎鑊甘之若飴，百世而下，凜凜猶有生氣。是豈泄然不恤國事而以一死自謝者所可同日道哉！由是觀之，固未可以成敗之常見論也。&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of these families were pardoned and allowed to return to their homeland during the reign of [[Hongxi Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Ming]]'', Volume 141: 仁宗即位，谕礼部：「建文诸臣，已蒙显戮。家属籍在官者，悉宥为民，还其田土。其外亲戍边者，留一人戍所，余放还。」&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
During the early reign of the Yongle Emperor, the territorial princes were restored of their positions. However, they were relocated away from the frontiers, and gradually stripped of their military power. With the subsequent policies enforced by the Yongle Emperor, the emperor was successful in consolidating the power of the central government.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;顧誠《明代的宗室》，《明清史国际学术讨论会论文集》，天津人民出版社1982年7月第1版&lt;/ref&gt; In 1426, the [[Xuande Emperor]] managed to force all of the territorial princes to renounce their remaining personal army after suppressing the rebellion of [[Zhu Gaoxu]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The Yongle Emperor began the preparation for relocating the imperial capital to Beiping in 1403, a process that lasted throughout his entire reign.&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 二月，以北平為北京。設北京留守，行後軍都督府，行部，國子監。改北平曰順天府。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mingjian Gangmu'', Volume 2: 秋八月，徙富民實北京。時發流罪以下墾北京田，又徙直隸、蘇州等十郡、浙江等九省富民實之。&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the future [[Forbidden City]] along with the restructuring of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] were constantly ongoing. In 1420, the reconstruction of Beiping City was completed, and the Ming Dynasty officially relocated the imperial capital to Beiping and renamed the city to ''Beijing''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Ming]]'', Volume 6: 九月丁亥，诏自明年改京师为南京，北京为京师。&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] between 1928 and 1949, Beijing remains to be the fixed [[Historical capitals of China|capital of China]] ever since.

The '''Royal commission into whether there has been corrupt or criminal conduct by any Western Australian Police Officer''', commonly known as the '''Kennedy Royal Commission''', was a [[Royal Commission]] established in 2002 by the state government of [[Western Australia]] to determine whether any officer of the [[Western Australia Police]] had engaged in [[Police corruption|corrupt or criminal conduct]]. The commission issued an interim report on 20 December 2002 and a final report on 30 January 2004.
 
The commissioner was Hon. G. A. Kennedy QC.  Establishment of the commission arose from widespread public concern over the behaviour and integrity of the Western Australia Police.  The [[terms of reference]] required inquiry into factual matters and the effectiveness of police procedures.

The final report of the commission concluded that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... the full range of corrupt or criminal conduct from stealing to assaults, perjury, drug dealing and the improper disclosure of confidential information have been examined.  [the Western Australian Police force] has been ineffective in monitoring those events and modifying its procedures to deal with that conduct and to prevent its repetition.''&lt;ref name=rcomV1Pt1&gt;

''The fact that there remain in WAPS a number of officers who participated in this conduct, and who not only refused to admit it, but also uniformly denied it with vehemence, is a matter of concern.''&lt;ref name=rcomV1Pt1/&gt;{{rp|p 4}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A principal recommendation was that a Crime and Corruption Commission be established as an oversight body in a system where "the [[Police commissioner|Commissioner of Police]] should retain the primary responsibility for managing the discipline of the [[Police|Police Service]]".&lt;ref name=MiscRep2011&gt;[http://www.ccc.wa.gov.au/Publications/Reports/Published%20Reports%202011/Management%20of%20Misconduct%20by%20Western%20Australia%20Police.pdf Report on the Management of Misconduct by Western Australia Police] page 5, at Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission, 2 September 2011.

{{rape}}
{{Main article|Rape}}
'''Rape''' is a type of [[sexual assault]] initiated by one or more persons against another person without that person's [[consent]]. The act may be carried out by physical force, or where the person is under threat or manipulation, or with a person who is incapable of valid consent.'''&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|date=15 April 2011|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rape%5B3%5D}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual violence chapter 6|work=[[World Health Organization]]|date=15 April 2011|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape|publisher=dictionary.reference.com|date=15 April 2011|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rape}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape|publisher=legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com|date=15 April 2011|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/rape}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the name of a [[statutory]] crime in jurisdictions such as [[England and Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[California]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], and is a legal term of art used in the definition of the offence of [[sexual violation]] in [[New Zealand]].

Definitions of ''rape'' vary, and though rape is usually dependent upon whether or not consent was present during the act,&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=who.int/&gt;&lt;ref name=dictionary.reference.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=thefreedictionary.com/&gt; the term "consent" varies as well. [[Minor (law)|Minors]], for example, are often considered too young to consent to sexual relations with older persons (see [[statutory rape]] and [[age of consent]]).&lt;ref name=thefreedictionary.com/&gt; Consent is also considered invalid if obtained under [[duress]], or from a person who does not have the ability to understand the nature of the act, due to factors such as young age, mental disability, or substance intoxication.&lt;ref name=thefreedictionary.com/&gt;

Many jurisdictions, such as [[Canada]], and the several [[U.S. state|US]] and [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]], have abandoned the term 'rape' in favor of other terms such as 'sexual assault', 'sexual intercourse without consent', 'criminal sexual conduct', etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85f0033m/85f0033m2008019-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/25.%20Sexual%20Offences/%E2%80%98rape%E2%80%99-penetrative-sexual-offence&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology and definitions==

===Classification===
Depending on the jurisdiction, rape may be characterized as a [[sexual offence]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, by the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]] and the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; or an [[offence against the person]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]], the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] and the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rape may also be characterized as a form of [[aggravated assault]] or [[Battery (crime)|battery]], or both, [[indecent assault]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, in [[England and Wales]] before the enactment of the Sexual Offences Act 2003: R v Hodgson [1973] QB 565 (indecent assault on a woman held to be an alternative verdict to rape in a case where the accused was acquitted of rape on grounds of the consent of the victim, who was aged under 16, which was not, by virtue of section 14(2) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, a defence to indecent assault)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[sexual assault]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, in [[England and Wales]] after the enactment of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; or battery, or both.

===Actus reus===
To sustain a conviction, rape might require proof that the defendant had [[sexual penetration]] with another person. Depending on the jurisdiction, the [[actus reus]] of rape may consist of "having [[carnal knowledge]] of" a woman,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, under the [[common law]] of England, and at common law in [[Scotland]]&lt;/ref&gt; or "having [[Sexual intercourse#Consent and sexual offenses|sexual intercourse]] with" a woman (including a girl) specifically,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, under the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976]] as read with section 46 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]]&lt;/ref&gt; or either a woman or a man (including a girl or a boy) generally,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, under section 1 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]], as substituted by section 142 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]], and read with section 46 of the former mentioned Act&lt;/ref&gt; or engaging in sexual intercourse with a person (which term includes an [[intersex]] person who might arguably be neither a woman nor a man)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, under section 261 of the California Penal Code,&lt;/ref&gt; or having "sexual connection" with a person affected by penile penetration of that person's genitalia,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, under section 128(2) of the [[Crimes Act 1961]]&lt;/ref&gt; or penile penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth (these terms construed as including surgically constructed organs) of a person.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, under section 1 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Prosecutor v. Anto Furundžija'', the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] included [[fellatio]] in the definition of rape, because [para 183]: "The Trial Chamber holds that the forced penetration of the mouth by the male sexual organ constitutes a most humiliating and degrading attack upon human dignity. The essence of the whole corpus of international humanitarian law as well as human rights law lies in the protection of the human dignity of every person, whatever his or her gender".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/furundzija/tjug/en/fur-tj981210e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mens rea===
Countries around the world differ in how they deal with the [[mens rea]] element in the law regarding rape, (i.e. the belief of the accused that the victim is not consenting or might not be consenting), and in how they place the onus of proof with regard to belief of consent.

For example, under the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], the belief must be "reasonable" and "Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/1&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions the mens rea is quite complex, such as in [[New South Wales]], where the law reads:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s61ha.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 61HA Consent in relation to sexual assault offences

(3) Knowledge about consent

A person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person ''knows that the other person does not consent''&lt;ref&gt;the expression "knows that the other person does not consent" refers to its use in section 61I Sexual assault [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s61i.html]&lt;/ref&gt; to the sexual intercourse if:

:(a) the person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse, or

:(b) the person is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, or

:(c) the person has no reasonable grounds for believing that the other person consents to the sexual intercourse.

For the purpose of making any such finding, the trier of fact must have regard to all the circumstances of the case:

:(d) including any steps taken by the person to ascertain whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, but

:(e) not including any self-induced intoxication of the person.

The Explanatory Report of the Istanbul Convention, states at para 189: "The interpretation of the word “intentionally” is left to domestic law, but the requirement for intentional conduct relates to all the elements of the offence". [in regard to Article 36 of the Convention – Sexual violence, including rape].&lt;ref&gt;http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attendant circumstances===
Rape has been defined so as to require proof that the sexual act in question was done without the victim's [[Consent (criminal law)|consent]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, by section 1 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; or so as to require proof that it was done either without their consent or, alternatively, against their will.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, by section 261 of the California Penal Code&lt;/ref&gt;

There is not always a requirement that the victim did not consent. In the England and Wales, section 5 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] creates the offence of "rape of a child under 13" and contains no reference to consent. After describing the sexual act the offence prohibits, the explanatory notes to the Act say "whether or not the child consented to this act is irrelevant".&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Offences Act 2003: Explanatory Notes, paragraph 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[M.C. v. Bulgaria]],&lt;ref&gt;http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22dmdocnumber%22:[%22699398%22],%22itemid%22:[%22001-61521%22]}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the victim does not necessarily have to resist physically for the crime of rape to be committed [para 166]:
:"[T]he Court is persuaded that any rigid approach to the prosecution of sexual offences, such as requiring proof of physical resistance in all circumstances, risks leaving certain types of rape unpunished and thus jeopardising the effective protection of the individual's sexual autonomy. In accordance with contemporary standards and trends in that area, the member States' positive obligations under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention [Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms] must be seen as requiring the penalisation and effective prosecution of any non-consensual sexual act, including in the absence of physical resistance by the victim."

Some circumstances, such as where the victim is kidnapped or in detention, or under conditions of war or genocide, may be viewed as so coercive, that they presume non-consent altogether; for example in ''ICTY, The Prosecutor v. Kunarac, Kovac and Vukovic'', it was ruled, in regard to the [[rape during the Bosnian War]], where women were kept in detention centers, under extremely harsh conditions, and were selected for sex by soldiers and policemen, that [para 132]: "Such detentions amount to circumstances that were so coercive as to negate any possibility of consent".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icrc.org/casebook/doc/case-study/icty-kunarac-kovac-vukovic-case-study.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue arises in law as who can legally consent, for example with regard to persons who suffer from mental or physical disability. Although laws differ by jurisdiction, emerging international standards suggest that a person's mental or physical disability, should not, ''in and of itself'', render the sexual interaction illegal, but rather ''the exploitation or abuse'' of such disability by the perpetrator should do so: in the [[European Union]], the ''Directive 2011/93/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011'' reads (with regard to the determination of legal consent of a child who is above the [[age of consent]]): "(10) Disability, by itself, does not automatically constitute an impossibility to consent to sexual relations. However, the abuse of the existence of such a disability in order to engage in sexual activities with a child should be criminalised".&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:335:0001:0014:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redefinitions and statute ===

==== General ====
{{Further information|History of rape}}
From the second part of the 20th century onwards, the crime of rape has undergone major changes in definition in many countries, especially in [[Western countries]]. It has evolved from its narrow traditional definition of forced penetration of a vagina by a penis, outside of [[marriage]], to a broader definition, which includes forced sex in marriage ([[marital rape]]), and may also include other sexual acts (such as [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] sexual penetration); the latter were traditionally dealt with under [[sodomy law]]s. This redefinition of rape had the effect of defining [[male rape]]. There have also been changes in the legal definition of consent/coercion.&lt;ref name="The Routledge Handbook of European Criminology"&gt;{{Google books |id=VWttAAAAQBAJ |page=1 |title=The Routledge Handbook of European Criminology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two different changes have been made in recent decades in many jurisdictions in regard to the criminal offense of rape as it relates to marital status:

*the criminalization of rape between spouses ('marital rape')
*the removal of the stipulation that, if after the act of rape the victim and the perpetrator get married to each other, the prosecution ends ('marry-your-rapist law')

==== Marital rape ====
{{Main article|Marital rape}}
Throughout much of the history, rape in marriage was not a crime. Most cultures subscribed to the idea of the existence of 'conjugal rights' to sexual intercourse with one's spouse, and, until well into the 20th century, most legal systems generally accepted, overtly or tacitly, that such 'rights' could be taken by force, against the will of the wife. Traditional understanding and views of [[marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexuality]], [[gender roles]] and [[self determination]] have started to be challenged in most Western countries during the 1960s and 1970s, which has led to the subsequent criminalization of marital rape during the following decades. With a few notable exceptions, it was during the past 30 years when most laws against marital rape have been enacted. Several countries in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]] made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but other countries in Western Europe and the English-speaking [[Western World]] outlawed it much later, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="The Routledge Handbook of European Criminology"/&gt;

Marital rape is included in the 1993 [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] as a form of [[violence against women]], which reads:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related violence, ''marital rape'', female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation [...]";

It is also included in the [https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383 Council of Europe Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence], which reads:

:"This [violence against women] includes, but is not limited to, the following: a. violence occurring in the family or domestic unit, including, ''inter alia'', physical and mental aggression, emotional and psychological abuse, rape and sexual abuse, incest, ''rape between spouses, regular or occasional partners and cohabitants'', crimes committed in the name of honour, female genital and sexual mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, such as forced marriages [...]".

In addition, the [[World Health Organization]], defines sexual violence as: "any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person’s sexuality using coercion, ''by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim'', in any setting, including but not limited to home and work".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a crime of abduction==
Originally, in [[Ancient Rome]], 'rape' was a crime-defining primarily the act of a male [[Kidnapping|abducting]] a female without the consent of the man under whose authority she was (typically father or husband); sexual intercourse was not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Diana C. Moses, "Livy's Lucretia and the Validity of Coerced Consent in Roman Law," in ''Consent and Coercion to Sex and Marriage in Ancient and Medieval Societies'' (Dunbarton Oaks, 1993), p. 50; Gillian Clark, ''Women in Late Antiquity: Pagan and Christian Life-styles'' (Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in many legal systems (such as 17th century France) the consent of the woman to sexual intercourse was not a defense - the act was still a crime if done without the consent of her father.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Orenstein, ''Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked'' p 36 ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; While the laws on rape differed by historical period and culture, some elements were common to most jurisdictions until the second part of the 20th century (when rape laws underwent major changes): 'rape' was a crime that could be committed only between parties who were not married to each other, and only by a male against a female.

==Common law==

Rape was an offense under the [[common law]] of England. That offense became an offense under the law of other countries, including Australia and the United States, as a result of colonization or conquest, or the following cession (see [[British Empire]]). It is discussed at [[Rape in English law#History]].

Under this law, rape traditionally describes the act of a male forcing a female to have sexual intercourse (sexual penetration of the vagina by the penis) with him. Common law rape required the utmost physical resistance by the victim, as well as substantial force by the defendant. The common law crime of rape was collectively adopted by the American colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Until the late twentieth century, [[spousal rape]] was not considered a true rape case because both spouses were deemed to have consented to a lifelong sexual relationship through the wedding vows. However, with changes to the marital rape exemption, as well as with the significant development of women's rights, the belief of a marital right to force sexual intercourse has become less widely held.

Rape was also an offense at common law in [[Scotland]]. This offense was not derived from the English offense as Scotland retained its own system of criminal law under the terms of the [[Acts of Union 1707]].

==International guidelines, recommendations, and obligations==
In recent years, there have been various guidelines and recommendations from international [[human rights]] organizations in regard to rape and sexual violence. One view that is advanced is that the offense of 'rape' should be replaced with a broader offense of 'sexual assault'. For instance, the ''Handbook for Legislation on Violence against Women'' from the [[UN]] Department of Economic and Social Affairs
Division for the Advancement of Women gives these suggestions about legislation on sexual violence:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/handbook/Handbook%20for%20legislation%20on%20violence%20against%20women.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Legislation should:
* Define sexual assault as a violation of bodily integrity and sexual autonomy;
* Replace existing offences of rape and “indecent” assault with a broad offence of sexual assault graded based on harm;
* Provide for aggravating circumstances including, but not limited to, the age of the survivor, the relationship of the perpetrator and survivor, the use or threat of violence, the presence of multiple perpetrators, and grave physical or mental consequences of the attack on the victim;
* Remove any requirement that sexual assault be committed by force or violence, and any requirement of proof of penetration, and minimize secondary victimization of the complainant/survivor in proceedings by enacting a definition of sexual assault that either:
:: Requires the existence of “unequivocal and voluntary agreement” and requiring proof by the accused of steps taken to ascertain whether the complainant/survivor was consenting; or
:: Requires that the act take place in “coercive circumstances” and includes a broad range of coercive circumstances; and
* Specifically criminalize sexual assault within a relationship (i.e., “marital rape”), either by:
:: Providing that sexual assault provisions apply “irrespective of the nature of the relationship” between the perpetrator and complainant; or
:: Stating that “no marriage or other relationship shall constitute a defence to a charge of sexual assault under the legislation.”
}}

The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, which creates legally binding obligations for countries which choose to ratify it,&lt;ref name="oas.org"/&gt; reads:&lt;ref&gt;http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Article 36 – Sexual violence, including rape

:1 Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that the following intentional conducts are criminalised:
:a engaging in non-consensual vaginal, anal or oral penetration of a sexual nature of the body of another person with any bodily part or object;
:b engaging in other non-consensual acts of a sexual nature with a person;
:c causing another person to engage in non-consensual acts of a sexual nature with a third person.

:2 Consent must be given voluntarily as the result of the person’s free will assessed in the context of the surrounding circumstances.

:3 Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that the provisions of paragraph 1 also apply to acts committed against former or current spouses or partners as recognised by internal law.

Article 36 must also be read together with Article 43 &lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm See paragraphs 219 and 220 of the Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt; which reads:

Article 43 – Application of criminal offences
: The offences established in accordance with this Convention shall apply irrespective of the nature of the relationship between victim and perpetrator.
}}

==Punishment==
{{see also|Prison rape}}

===Punishment of assailants===
Punishment for rape in most countries today is imprisonment. [[Castration]] is sometimes a punishment for rape and, controversially, some U.S. jurisdictions allow shorter sentences for sex criminals who agree to voluntary [[chemical castration]].

In the past, rape was often punished with death, and it is punishable by death in at least 10 countries today: [[China]], [[Afghanistan]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Egypt]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Pakistan]], and [[North Korea]]. In some of these instances, special circumstances apply. For example, rape is only punishable by death in India if the victim dies or is put in a persistent vegetative state, and/or if the rapist is a repeat offender, and in Iran, a death sentence for rape can be substituted with compensation, with or without imprisonment and flogging, if the victim so chooses.

In 1977, in ''[[Coker v. Georgia]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that the death penalty for the crime of rape of an adult woman was cruel and unusual punishment, and thus banned it as a violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and in 2008 in ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'' it ruled the same in regard to [[child sexual abuse|rape of a child]].

Prison sentences for rape are not uniform. A study made by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] of prison releases in 1992, involving about 80 percent of the prison population, found that the average sentence for convicted rapists was 9.8 years, while the actual time served was 5.4 years. This follows the typical pattern of violent crimes in the US, where those convicted typically serve no more than half of their sentence.&lt;ref&gt;http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/PSATSFV.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2002 and 2003, more than one in ten convicted rapists in Victoria, Australia, served a wholly [[suspended sentence]], and the average total effective sentence for rape was seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One in Ten Rapists Walks Free|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/15/1097784044926.html?from=storylhs|first=Ian|last=Munro|publisher=The Age Company|work=The Age |location=Australia|date=16 October 2004|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the average sentence given for rape is 5 – 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejournal.ie/rape-sentencing-ireland-772129-Jan2013/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punishment of victims===
{{main article|Victim blaming|Honor killing|Slut-shaming}}
While the practice is condemned as barbaric by many present-day societies{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}, some societies punish the victims of rape as well as the perpetrators. According to such cultures, being raped dishonors the victim and, in many cases, the victim's family. In some countries (e.g. Libya, Afghanistan) rape victims are sometimes killed to restore honor to the family's name.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khaama.com/honor-killing-afghan-man-and-woman-killed-in-ghazni-1254&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] drama ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', the title character kills his raped, maimed daughter in what he believes to be a [[mercy killing]].

Certain cultures have historically promoted a system of [[honor]], dishonor, and shame, which was applied with particular strictness to females. A victim of rape would be considered to have lost her honorable reputation and place in society, a loss of honor which entailed [[shame]] on the woman's family group as well. In early [[ancient Rome]], [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], and other cultures, a pressure has existed which has led women to commit suicide after becoming victims of rape. The iconic Roman instance is that of [[Lucretia]]. Likewise, the suicide of female rape victims for reasons of shame is also historically documented in Chinese and Japanese culture.

In countries which outlaw [[fornication]] or [[adultery]], rape victims may become subject to these laws (if they cannot prove the rape case and/or if it is revealed they were not [[virgins]] at the time of the assault - in the case of unmarried victims).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21595814&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhutan==
Chapter 14 (Sexual Offenses) of the 2004 Penal Code of Bhutan outlaws rape and other sexual offenses.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unodc.org/tldb/pdf/Bhutan_Penal_Code_2004_Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the criminal code, there are several categories of rape, which are punished differently, depending on factors such as the age of the victim, the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, the number of participants (gang rape), whether the victim was pregnant, whether the injury occurred. [[Marital rape|Marital Rape]] is also recognized as an offense under the 2004 laws, being classified as a petty misdemeanour. The most serious form of rape is [[Gang rape]] of a child under twelve years of age, classified as a felony of the first degree.

{{Quotation|Rape

==Canada==

The word ''rape'' is not used in the Canadian Criminal Code. Instead, the law criminalizes "sexual assault".
Sexual assault is defined as sexual contact with another person without that other person's consent. Consent is defined in section 273.1(1) as "''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''". For more details, see [[Sexual assault#Canada]].

Any act of sexual penetration, whatever its nature, committed against another person by violence, constraint, threat or surprise, is rape. Rape is punished by a maximum of fifteen years' criminal imprisonment.

Rape is punished by a maximum of twenty years' criminal imprisonment in certain aggravating factors (including victim under age of 15).

Rape is punished by a maximum of thirty years' criminal imprisonment where it caused the death of the victim.

Rape is punished by a maximum of imprisonment for life when it is preceded, accompanied or followed by torture or acts of barbarity.

The penalty shall be imposed without prejudice to the penalties that may apply for the commission of other offenses.

==Iran==
In Iran, the sentence for a rape case is a death penalty by hanging in public squares or prisons.

==Israel==
The definition of the criminal offense of rape in [[Israel]] is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/investment/anti-bribery/anti-briberyconvention/43289694.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape
345.(a)

If a person had intercourse with a woman

(1)without her freely given consent;

(2)with the woman's consent, which was obtained by deceit in respect of the identity of the person or the nature of the act;

(3)when the woman is a minor below age 14, even with her consent;

(4)by exploiting the woman's state of unconsciousness or other condition that prevents her from giving her free consent;

(5)by exploiting the fact that she is mentally
ill or deficient, if –because of her illness or mental deficiency–her consent to
intercourse did not constitute free consent;

then he committed rape and is liable to sixteen years
imprisonment.

===Consent===
The mere fact that a person ''allows'' sexual connection to be performed on them, does not automatically mean that they are legally ''consenting''. If that person allows sexual connection due to coercion (e.g., under force, threats or fear of force; when he/she is asleep or very intoxicated; if he/she is affected by an intellectual, mental, or physical condition or impairment of a certain nature and degree; when he/she is mistaken about the partner's identity), then he/she is not legally consenting.

128A Allowing sexual activity does not amount to consent in some circumstances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329057.html |title=Crimes Act 1961 No 43 (as at 18 April 2012), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1) A person does not consent to sexual activity just because he or she does not protest or offer physical resistance to the activity.

(2) A person does not consent to sexual activity if he or she allows the activity because of—
:(a) force applied to him or her or some other person; or
:(b) the threat (express or implied) of the application of force to him or her or some other person; or
:(c) the fear of the application of force to him or her or some other person.

(3) A person does not consent to sexual activity if the activity occurs while he or she is asleep or unconscious.

(4) A person does not consent to sexual activity if the activity occurs while he or she is so affected by alcohol or some other drug that he or she cannot consent or refuse to consent to the activity.

(5) A person does not consent to sexual activity if the activity occurs while he or she is affected by an intellectual, mental, or physical condition or impairment of such a nature and degree that he or she cannot consent or refuse to consent to the activity.

(6) One person does not consent to sexual activity with another person if he or she allows the sexual activity because he or she is mistaken about who the other person is.

(7) A person does not consent to an act of sexual activity if he or she allows the act because he or she is mistaken about its nature and quality.

(8) This section does not limit the circumstances in which a person does not consent to sexual activity.

(9) For the purposes of this section,—
:allows includes acquiesces in, submits to, participates in, and undertakes sexual activity, in relation to a person, means—
:(a) sexual connection with the person; or
:(b) the doing on the person of an indecent act that, without the person's consent, would be an indecent assault of the person.

''Attempted sexual violation and assault with intent to commit sexual violation'' are also punished (Article 129).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329070.html |title=Crimes Act 1961 No 43 (as at 18 April 2012), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norway==

In Norway, rape is defined under the Norwegian Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English translation of the Norwegian penal code (unofficial)|url=http://www.ub.uio.no/ujur/ulovdata/lov-19020522-010-eng.pdf|publisher=University of Oslo|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; § 192 as either:
* 1. engaging in sexual activity by means of violence or threatening behaviour,
* 2. engaging in sexual activity with somebody who is unconscious or for any other reason incapable of resisting the act, or
* 3. by means of violence or threatening behaviour compelling any person to engage in sexual activity with another person, or to carry out similar actions with him- or herself.

When any of these circumstances occur, a person guilty of rape is punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment. However, if a person is guilty of rape through [[gross negligence]] he or she is liable to imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years.

If the activity in question was sexual intercourse or the offender has rendered a person unconscious or unable to resist the sexual activity, the penalty imposed shall be no less than three years imprisonment.

Further, the same section defines ''aggravated rape'' as a rape committed
* a. by multiple persons in cooperation (gang rape)
* b. in a particularly painful or offensive manner
* c. by a person previously convicted of rape under § 192 or of sexual activity with a child under the age of 14 (as per § 195 of the penal code)
* d. in such a way that the victim either dies or receives grievous bodily harm.

The section recognizes [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (defined in the ''Infection Protection Act'') as grievous bodily harm.

==Philippines==
Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (Title Eight of Act No. 3815) provides that:

Rape: When And How Committed. – Rape is committed:
:1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
::a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;
::b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;
::c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and,
::d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joselito Guianan Chan, Managing Partner, Chan Robles &amp;amp; Associates Law Firm |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno8353.htm |title=Philippine Laws, Statutes And Codes – Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |publisher=Chanrobles.com |date=30 September 1997|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 3 of this Code, which relates to rape, was inserted by the [[Anti-Rape Law of 1997]]. By section 2 of that Act, the crime of rape is classified as a crime against persons under that Code.

==Russia==
According to the Article 131 of the [[Criminal Code of Russia]], rape is defined as heterosexual vaginal intercourse using violence or threat of violence or if the victim is in a helpless state. The other forms of a violent sexual intercourse (male-male, female-male, female-female and non-vaginal male-female) are called "coercive sexual actions" and are punishable by the Article 132. These two crimes, however, are punishable identically. Besides, such crimes as sexual relations with a person under the age of consent (16 years as of 2013, article 134) and depraved actions (Article 135), if committed against a person under 12 years since 2012 are considered rape or coercive sexual actions (depending on sex of the offender and the victim and the type of intercourse) and punished according to the articles 131 or 132, because such victim is deemed to be in a helpless state due to his/her age. However, the Article 134 punishes sexual activity between same-sex pairings '''harsher''' than sexual activity between opposite-sex pairings when one of the persons is under 16 years old.

Rape or coercive sexual actions without any [[aggravating circumstance]]s are punishable with 3 to 6 years of imprisonment. If the crime:
* was committed repeatedly (against 1 or more than 1 victim)
* was committed by a group of criminals
* was committed with a threat of murder or grievous harm to the health
* was committed with particular cruelty (e.g. the criminal used violence that caused severe physical pain or the crime was committed in presence of relatives of the victim)
* caused an STD infection

then it is punishable with 4 to 10 years of imprisonment with possible subsequent restraint of liberty for up to 2 years (i.e. the criminal may not change or leave residence without permission and must register himself at local penal inspectorate 1 to 4 times a month; court may also impose additional restrictions such as the criminal may not leave home in certain hours, visit certain locations, change work without permission).

If the crime

* Was committed against a person between 14 and 18 years
* Caused the grievous harm to the health, HIV infection or other grievous consequences (e.g. suicide of the victim)

then it is punishable with 8 to 15 years of imprisonment with the subsequent mandatory restraint of liberty for up to 2 years and a possible ban on certain occupations or employment positions for up to 20 years.

If the crime

* Caused the death of the victim by inadvertency
* Was committed against a person under 14 years

then it is punishable with 12 to 20 years of imprisonment with the subsequent mandatory restraint of liberty for up to 2 years and a possible ban on certain occupations or employment positions for up to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultant.ru/popular/ukrf/10_26.html#p1602 |title=ПРЕСТУПЛЕНИЯ ПРОТИВ ПОЛОВОЙ НЕПРИКОСНОВЕННОСТИ И ПОЛОВОЙ СВОБОДЫ ЛИЧНОСТИ – Уголовный кодекс РФ (УК РФ) от 13.06.1996 N 63-ФЗ \ Консультант Плюс |publisher=Consultant.ru |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
In South Africa, rape is defined by the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]] (Act No. 32 of 2007).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2007-032.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This act has repealed the [[common law]] offence of rape and replaced it with a new expanded statutory offence of rape, applicable to all forms of sexual penetration without consent, irrespective of gender. Rape is defined in section 3 of the act as follows:
{{Quotation|Any person ("A") who unlawfully and intentionally commits an act of sexual penetration with a complainant ("B"), without the consent of B, is guilty of the offence of rape.}}
and "sexual penetration" is defined as:
{{Quotation|any act which causes penetration to any extent whatsoever by—
:(a) the genital organs of one person into or beyond the genital organs, anus, or mouth of another person;
:(b) any other part of the body of one person or, any object, including any part of the body of an animal, into or beyond the genital organs or anus of another person; or
:(c) the genital organs of an animal, into or beyond the mouth of another person[.]}}
The law also clarifies that marital rape is illegal; section 56 of the Act provides that:
{{Quotation|Whenever an accused person is charged with an offence under section 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 it is not a valid defence for that accused person to contend that a marital or other relationship exists or existed between him or her and the complainant.}}

==Switzerland==
Rape is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/3/311.0.en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Art. 190

:Any person who forces a person of the female sex by threats or violence, psychological pressure or by being made incapable of resistance to submit to sexual intercourse is liable to a custodial sentence of from one to ten years.}}

Marital rape was made illegal in 1992, and since 2004 marital rape is prosecutable ex-officio (meaning it can be prosecuted even if the wife doesn't complain).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialinfo.ch/cgi-bin/dicoposso/show.cfm?id=432&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centrelavi-ge.ch/index.php?q=victimes-que-faire/violences-sexuelles/que-faire-specifiquement-en-cas-de-viol-ou-de-contraintes&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape of a male is considered a heavy sexual assault/thread and is prosecuted under Art. 189 of the Swiss Penalty Code.

==Trinidad and Tobago==
Rape under the law of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] is an [[indictable offence]], created by section 4 of the Sexual Offenses Act:&lt;ref&gt;http://rgd.legalaffairs.gov.tt/laws2/alphabetical_list/lawspdfs/11.28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://caribbean.unwomen.org/en/caribbean-gbv-law-portal/country-resources/trinidad-and-tobago&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 4. Rape

(1) Subject to subsection (2), a person (“the accused”) commits the offence of rape when he has sexual intercourse with another person (“the complainant”)—
:(a) without the consent of the complainant where he knows that the complainant does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether the complainant consents; or
:(b) with the consent of the complainant where the consent—
::(i) is extorted by threat or fear of bodily harm to the complainant or to another;
::(ii) is obtained by personating someone else;
::(iii) is obtained by false or fraudulent representations as to the nature of the intercourse; or
::(iv) is obtained by unlawfully detaining the complainant

Marital rape is also illegal; subsection (5) states: "(5) This section also applies to a husband in relation to the commission of the offence of rape on his wife."

}}

;Rape of a young child:
This offence is created by section 18 of the [[Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009]].

;History:
Prior to [[Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009]], rape in [[Scots Law]] differed from the definition of rape in other legal systems. In [[Scotland]], rape was defined as "a crime at [[common law]] which consisted of the [[carnal knowledge]] of a female by a male person without her consent". Under Scots law, rape could only be carried out by a male who penetrated a female's vagina. If a man's anus was penetrated by another man's penis, this was called [[sodomy]] and was tried under indecent assault, a form of aggravated assault. Likewise, if a male penetrated a female's anus by his penis without her consent, he would also be charged with indecent assault.

In Scotland, rape can only be prosecuted in the [[High Court of Justiciary]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995]], section 3&lt;/ref&gt; and if convicted, the maximum penalty available to the court is life imprisonment. Evidence of distress can be used as [[corroborating evidence]]. Evidence of distress would be recognised by the first person or friend that the victim sees after the event. This should not be confused with [[hearsay]] evidence, which is not normally allowed to be led.

One of the key elements to prosecute a male for rape is to prove that the male had sexual intercourse without the female's consent. For sexual intercourse not to be rape, the ''active'' consent of the female is needed. This means it is not enough for a woman to be 'passive', she must actively consent and was established by [[Lord Advocate's Reference]] (No. 1 of 2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/Refence%201.html Link to reference] at Scottish Court Service.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a male could still be convicted of rape, even though the female did not say anything or show any resistance. This is a change in the law, as previously men who had sexual intercourse with sleeping women (as in the case of Charles Sweenie) or women who were unconscious due to voluntarily taking drugs or alcohol (see HMA v Logan) were charged with the lesser crime of indecent assault, rather than rape, as they had not used force to achieve penetration. Lord Advocate's Reference (No 1 of 2001), by requiring "active consent", had opened up the law to decide whether a voluntarily drunk or intoxicated woman can consent to sexual intercourse. This was clarified under the new laws of 2009 which state that sexual intercourse is non-consensual, and therefore considered rape if it occurs :(...) where the conduct occurs at a time when B is incapable because of the effect of alcohol or any other substance of consenting to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/9/section/13 |title=Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penetration is sufficient for a sexual intercourse to be deemed rape: there needs not to be any excretion of semen and the female's [[hymen]] does not have to be ruptured.

In [[Scotland]], rape continued to be a gender-specific crime until the [[Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8092157.stm MSPs pass major sex crime reforms] BBC News 10 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This Act came into force on 1 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oqps.gov.uk/legislation/ssi/ssi2010/pdf/ssi_20100357_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Act expanded the definition of rape to include [[male rape]].

==United States==
{{see also|Rape in the United States#Criminal punishment}}

===State laws===
There is no national rape law in the United States, due to the [[United States v. Morrison]] ruling that parts of the [[Violence Against Women Act of 1994]] were unconstitutional. Each state has its own laws concerning sexual aggression. Nor is there any national standard in the US for defining and reporting male-male or female-perpetrated rapes. State laws vary considerably, and in most states, the term "rape" is no longer used, and the offense has been replaced by crimes such as "[[sexual assault]]", "[[Criminal Sexual Conduct|criminal sexual conduct]]", "sexual abuse", "[[Battery (crime)|sexual battery]]" etc. The US laws on [[sexual violence]] are complex, with states having numerous sex offenses, dealing with different situations. The laws on sex crimes have been changed and modernized significantly during the last decades and they continue to change.

===Uniform Code of Military Justice===

[[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] [USC Title 10, Subtitle A, Chapter 47X, Section 920, Article 120] defines rape as:

{{cquote|(a) Rape.— Any person subject to this chapter who commits a sexual act upon another person by:

(1) using unlawful force against that other person;

(2) using force causing or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to any person;

(3) threatening or placing that other person in fear that any person will be subjected to death, grievous bodily harm, or kidnapping;

(4) first rendering that other person unconscious; or

(5) administering to that other person by force or threat of force, or without the knowledge or consent of that person, a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substance and thereby substantially impairing the ability of that other person to appraise or control conduct;

is guilty of rape and shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/920- United States Code: Title 10,920. Art. 120.

Marital rape is banned; the law states: "Marriage is not a defense for any conduct in issue in any prosecution under this section."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/920 |title=10 USC § 920 - Art. 120.

===Rape reporting===

According to the [[USA Today]] reporter Kevin Johnson, "no other major category of crime – not murder, assault or robbery – has generated a more serious challenge to the credibility of national crime statistics" as has the crime of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://junksciencearchive.com/nov98/rape2.html|title=Rape statistics not crystal clear|website=junksciencearchive.com|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says: &lt;blockquote&gt; "There are good reasons to be cautious in drawing conclusions from reports on rape. The two most accepted studies available – the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Report and the Justice Department's annual National Crime Victimization Survey – each have widely acknowledged weaknesses." &lt;/blockquote&gt; The FBI's report fails to report rapes with male victims, both adults and children, fails to report non-forcible rapes of either gender ''by either gender'', and reflects only the number of rapes reported to police. The Justice Department's survey solicits information from people 12 and older, excluding the youngest victims of rape (and [[incest]]). However, by using a random national telephone survey of households, the National Crime Victimization Survey could pick up rapes unreported to the police. In addition, since both official reports collect rape data from states with widely divergent standards and definitions on what constitutes rape, uniform reporting is impossible.

A recent attempt to improve the tracking of rape, the National Violence Against Women survey was first published in 1998 by the National Institute of Justice and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its authors have acknowledged that they used different methodologies with "relatively high" margins of error. The 2000 report notes that "because annual rape [[victimization]] estimates (''nationwide'') are based on responses from ''only 24 women and 8 men'' (emphasis added) who reported being raped, they should be viewed with caution." The report goes on to note that it fails to report rapes perpetrated against children and adolescents, was well as those who were homeless, or living in institutions, group facilities, or in households without telephones.

The 2006 report of the National Violence Against Women survey was based on the much larger sample size of 8,000 men and 8,000 women. It estimated that "17.7 million women and 2.8 million men in the United States were forcibly raped at some time in their lives, with 302,091 women and 92,748 men forcibly raped in the year preceding the survey." The report defines "rape" to include completed and attempted rapes. However, the vast majority of rapes were completed: "Among all respondents, 14.8 percent of the women and 2.1 percent of the men said they were victims of a completed rape at some time in their life, whereas 2.8 percent of the women and 0.9 percent of the men said they were victims of an attempted rape only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/pubs-sum/210346.htm |title=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, National Institute of Justice, "Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Rape Victimization: Findings From the National Violence Against Women Survey," January 2006 |publisher=Ojp.usdoj.gov |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many states define sexual crimes other than male-on-female penetration as sexual assault rather than rape. There are no national standards for defining and reporting male-on-male, female-on-female or female-on-male offenses, so such crimes are generally not included in rape statistics unless these statistics are compiled using information from states which count them as rape.

The ''Hudyaka sa Panglao'' takes place on August 28 every year in the grounds of its parish church. The ten barangays of the municipality compete fiercely with each other to see which is the best of the best. Its own dance festival brings back ex-Panglao residents from all over the world, and instead of making a day of it, the music and dance lovers of [[Panglao, Bohol|Panglao]] try and make a whole week of it…and more. Actually, they take nine days and the whole town has a festive atmosphere with parties all over the place.
* ''Tanda'' Festival (May 6-15)
The Tanda Festival is an annual festival held in May at the town of Tubigon, Bohol in honor of its patron saint, Sr. San Isidro Labrador. Tanda is a unique local Tubigon name which means "short visit". Tanda Festival highlights three major events namely; Bulong-Imang Streetdancing and Showdown, Anyag sa Tubigon Beauty Pageant, and Agro-Technological Fair.

Bulong-Imang, derived from the rhythmic sound pattern of the drums and gong used in dancing, is a dance of praise and thanksgiving to Sr. San Isidro Labrador.It is held in Holy Cross Academy open field. The Anyag sa Tubigon, features the beauty and wit of Tubigon’s pride ladies in a beauty pageant. And lastly, the Agro-Technological Fair is a display and exhibit of the bountiful harvest of the mountains, farmlands, and the shores of Tubigon set against the backdrop of trading and commerce.

The festival highlights the following:Bulong-Imang Streetdancing Competition, Anyag sa Tubigon, Agro-Technological Fair, Bangkarera, Sambunot sa Awit and, Lambay Jam.

 
* ''Katigbawan'' Festival (June 17–24)
What distinguishes [[Catigbian, Bohol|Catigbian]] from other towns is its annual festival, the Katigbawan. A week-long festival comprising various activities like carabao-racing, hog-catching, agrofair, motorcross and a search for Miss Katigbawan. This affair happens only in June.
* ''Pana-ad sa [[Loboc, Bohol|Loboc]]'' (Holy Thursday and Good Friday).
A Holy Week procession.
* ''Pandayan'' Festival (February 27)
The Pandayan Festival is held at Barangay Lonoy, [[Jagna, Bohol|Jagna]] to celebrate the canonical erection or the parochial anniversary of St. Joseph the Worker Parish. All eight upland barangays of Jagna which is under the parochial jurisdiction of the Parish participates in the activities. Activities include a nine-day novena in honor of the patron saint, a procession of the image of St. Joseph the Worker, Carpentry and Handicrafts Fair, an inter - barangay basketball tournament and last but not least, the street dancing competition.
* ''Sambat Mascara y Regatta'' Festival (first Saturday of December)
The festival is in honor of St. Francis Xavier.
* ''Kasadyaan sa Napo'' (Napo, Loon, Bohol; first Sunday of February)
Started almost 20 years ago as a way of veneration of and thanksgiving to the Holy Child, this festival is a prelude to the May 25 fiesta of the barangay. The main feature of Kasadyaan is a street dancing competition participated in by its five traditional household clusters, namely, Inang-angan, Kabaybayunan, Tulay, Wawog and Tubig-Loon. In recent years, the participants have been grouped by “purok”. After the street dancing, the participants perform a tableau, which is also part of the competition. A “sinulog” to the Santo Niño culminates the celebration.
* ''SidlaKasilak or Festival of Lights'' (Loon, Bohol; August 30 – September 8)
This annual festival of lights honors the "Birhen sa Kasilak" (Our Lady of Light), patroness of Loon. It also expresses the enduring qualities of the town. The Visayan words "sidlak" (rise) and "silak" (shine) best describe the character of Loonanons as they conquer life's adversities and make the best out of their inherent talents and capabilities. The various sectors of the community mount sociocultural activities during the ten-day celebration which was started in 2000. Highlighting the festival is a fluvial procession followed by street dancing and dance of lights competitions. Other contests, all requiring the use of light, are also mounted. SidlaKasilak was inspired by past religious processions in Loon when the faithful would light candles in colorful hand-held lanterns or “parow”, the local version of the “parol”. In fact, during the first few years of the festival, the dancers brought traditional lanterns wrapped in Japanese paper. Candles, however, are no match to the wind made even stronger with every sway of the hands that held the lanterns. The Japanese paper, too, could not withstand too much heat nor could it resist the rain. Thus candles were later replaced with permanent yet adjustable lights like flashlights, magic sticks, light-emitting diodes and others. Glazed paper, plastic wrap and cloth have been used instead of Japanese paper. The distinctive nature of SidlaKasilak is manifested in its being the only evening street dancing event in Bohol. In addition, it does not require lavish costumes and props that onlookers do not appreciate in the dark. In fact, participating schools are required to use only their respective student uniforms. Community-based delegations choose their own attire. The contest criteria revolve solely on the lights and have remained the same for many years, to wit: lights design, color harmony and brightness (20%); choreography or movement and formation of lights (40%); and dynamics or manipulation and synchronization of the lights with the music (40%).
* ''Sinugboan'' Festival (May 27)
Sinugboan Festival is celebrated every May 27 in the municipality of [[Garcia Hernandez, Bohol|Garcia Hernandez]]. ''Sinugboan'' is a term closely related to the Cebuano word ''sugbo'' meaning to wallow. The use of the vernacular past tense "sinugbo" denotes an event of historical import. The festival highlights the town's annual commemoration of her foundation day. Activities include agro-industrial fair, recognition program for achievers, various games and street dancing competition where the storyline focuses on the creation and establishment of Garcia-Hernandez.
* ''Sinu-og Estokada'' Festival (September 21)
The Sinu-og Estokada Festival is celebrated at the town of [[Jagna, Bohol|Jagna]] in honor of their patron saint, Saint Michael the Archangel where two groups, one coming from barangay Mayana and the other from Cabungaan, perform a native war dance during the vesper procession and also during the morning fluvial procession on the feast day itself which falls on September 29. This distinct cultural tradition has been observed for more than a century and shows the rich cultural heritage of the town. The native war dance is performed with the accompaniment of a drum depicting the battle between the early Jagnaanon Christians and the invading Muslims from Mindanao. The male dancers representing the Jagnaanons recite verses while mimicking the fight with bolos during the dance.

The Sinu-og Estokada is a modification of the above sinu-og celebration. Here, the native war dance is portrayed as a fight between good and evil where the basic sequence of movements are modified conforming to a rhythm in marching and regular procedure. This festival is joined by the young adolescents of the town.

It is believed that Saint Michael the Archangel rescued the people from the hands of the invaders at that time and this belief has been handed down to the present generation of Jagnaanons. Thus, Saint Michael the Archangel is much loved and revered by all Jagnaanons and the feast day is celebrated with much fanfare.

* ''Suroy sa Musikero'' (December 25 – February 2).
This is a festival of food and Christmas songs.
* Bohol Fiestas (May).
* ''Ubi'' Festival (January).
Festival in celebration of the ubi tuber, a vegetable (''[[Dioscorea alata]]''). &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.inq7.net/globalnation/sec_phe/2004/jan/14-01.htm Bohol to hold 'ubi' festival] www.inq7.net Retrieved 4 December, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Tigum Bol-anon sa Tibuok Kalibutan'' or TBTK (July).

==Publication history==
=== ''Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story'' ===
[[File:March books 181524.jpg|thumb|right|Copies of all three installments (as well as a slipcase containing all three)]]
When [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] was 15 years old and living in rural Alabama, 50 miles south of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], he first heard of [[Rosa Parks]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] through [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], who was working for the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation (United States)|Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (F.O.R.). Lawson introduced Lewis to ''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]'', a 10-cent comic book published by F.O.R. that had a profound impact on Lewis. The comic book demonstrated in clear fashion to Lewis the power of the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence. Lawson became a mentor to Lewis, and Lewis began attending meetings every Tuesday night with approximately 20 other students from [[Fisk University]], [[Tennessee State University]], [[Vanderbilt University]], and [[American Baptist College]] to discuss nonviolent protest, with ''The Montgomery Story'' serving as one of their guides. ''The Montgomery Story'' would also influence other civil rights activists, including the [[Greensboro Four]].&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance&gt;Hughes, Joseph (September 16, 2013). [http://comicsalliance.com/congressman-john-lewis-interview-march-andrew-aydin-top-shelf/ "Congressman John Lewis And Andrew Aydin Talk Inspiring The ‘Children Of The Movement’ With ‘March’ (Interview)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918055700/http://comicsalliance.com/congressman-john-lewis-interview-march-andrew-aydin-top-shelf/ |date=2013-09-18 }}. [[Comics Alliance]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressman Lewis and Andrew Aydin===
Lewis became a U.S. congressman for [[Georgia's 5th congressional district]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=388755|title=GA District 5 – D Primary Race – Aug 12, 1986|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ourcampaigns1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=38194|title=GA District 5 Race – Nov 04, 1986|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working on his [[United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2008|2008 reelection campaign]], Lewis told his telecommunications and technology policy aide, Andrew Aydin, about ''The Montgomery Story'' and its influence.&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance/&gt;

Aydin, who had been reading comics since his grandmother bought him a copy of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #317 off a [[Piggly Wiggly]] spinner rack when he was eight years old,&lt;ref name=VAJQA&gt;Herbowy, Greg (Fall 2014). "Q+A: Congressman John Lewis, Andrew Aydin &amp; Nate Powell". ''Visual Arts Journal''. [[School of Visual Arts]]. pp.&amp;nbsp;48–51&lt;/ref&gt; found a digital copy of the book on the Internet and spent years tracking down an original print copy on [[EBay]]. Aydin explains ''The Montgomery Story''{{'}}s influence on ''March'' thus:

{{quote|Once he told me about it, and I connected those dots that a comic book had a meaningful impact on the early days of the Civil Rights movement, and in particular on young people, it just seemed self-evident. If it had happened before, why couldn't it happen again? I think part of that impulse was born out of a frustration with the way things are in our politics and our culture. The election of Barack Obama seemed like it was opening a huge door, and I think perhaps we put all of our dreams and aspirations on him, and failed to recognize that we too have to rise up, and we too have to make our voices heard. He's one man and can't do it alone, and we did not make Congress, we did not make our state legislators do what we needed them to do to make the society we all imagined in that campaign. And when I look back on it, the Civil Rights movement was so successful at using non-violence in so many different ways: [[Birmingham campaign|Birmingham]], Montgomery, [[Selma to Montgomery march|Selma in particular]], the [[Mississippi Freedom Summer]], the [[Freedom Rides]], the [[March on Washington]], all held different aspects, and when you look back at the comic book it was one tactic. It was the way they did it in Montgomery. But what if we took the broader story and showed all of the different tactics. Because what worked in Birmingham and what worked in Montgomery didn't necessarily work in Albany, and there were different reasons. The Sheriffs started adapting. They were moving prisoners out of city jails and putting them in county jails, and things like that, so you couldn't fill them up as fast. And we need to adapt. The tactics, the principles, they still work, but we need to adapt our use of them. And so showing how others had done that and how it had progressed seemed like such a natural way to sort of pursue those ends.&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance/&gt;}}

[[File:11.7.13MarchSigningByLuigiNovi14.jpg|thumb|Artist [[Nate Powell]] and co-authors [[Andrew Aydin]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] promoting the book at a November 7, 2013, book signing at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan]]
Aydin repeatedly suggested that Lewis himself write a comic book. (Lewis had previously written a traditional autobiography, ''Walking With the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement'',  co-authored with journalist Michael D'Orso and published in 1998. A national bestseller, that book won the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, was selected as a ''New York Times'' Notable Book of the Year, was included on ''Newsweek'' magazine's list of "50 Books For Our Times," and was named Nonfiction Book of the Year by the American Library Association.) Eventually Lewis decided to commit to Aydin's project, on the condition that Aydin write it with him. Aydin, who was in the middle of writing his master's thesis on ''The Montgomery Story'' and how it helped inspire protest movements around the world, agreed to the project, which he calls a life-changing moment. Much of Aydin's work on the project was listening to Lewis dictate his life story, anecdotes of which Aydin had often heard Lewis relate to children, parents and others visiting his office, and transcribing it.&lt;ref name=VAJQA/&gt;

=== Illustrator Nate Powell ===
In the early 2010s, illustrator [[Nate Powell]] learned that Top Shelf would be publishing ''March'', which Lewis and Aydin had finished writing. A few weeks later, Powell was contacted by Top Shelf co-founder [[Chris Staros]], who suggested he try out for the assignment. Although he already had other projects lined up, Powell sent some demo pages to Lewis and Aydin, and over the course of their subsequent correspondence, they realized that Powell would be well-suited for the job. Although Powell had illustrated stories that were "true to life", such as the 2012 graphic ''Silence of our Friends'', this would be the first time he would depict real-life historical figures, 300 of which Powell estimates are rendered in total in the trilogy. The scene in which Lewis meets Martin Luther King, Jr. for the first time was the first page Powell drew for ''March'', and although he found approaching that page difficult, he stated it made subsequent depictions of real-life people easier. Powell's approach was to develop a visual shorthand for each real person he had to draw, in the form of a "master drawing" to act as a reference template for that person's features, one that emphasized the person's skull structure, in lieu of referring constantly to photo reference in the course of the project, so that the characters would not look "too stale or photo-derived". He employed lifestyle and illustration books from the 1950s and 1960s, as well as Google searches, to depict fashion and automobiles of given time periods accurately.&lt;ref name=VAJQA/&gt;

The creative team eventually realized that the story required 500 – 600 pages, and that it should be broken up into volumes. This allowed Powell to give certain sequences the length he needed to render them at a pace he felt they required, in particular scenes of anxiety or tension. The scene in which Lewis wakes up and prepares to attend the [[first inauguration of Barack Obama|Obama inauguration]], for example, was expanded from two pages to five. Other examples were the scenes in which the child John Lewis hid under his house to avoid doing his farm chores or attend school, and the scene in which Lewis took a trip to Alabama through the segregated South with his uncle, which was expanded from two pages to six.&lt;ref name=VAJQA/&gt;

===Releases===
The first book in the trilogy, ''March: Book One'', was released in August 2013. The second book, ''March: Book Two'', was released January 20, 2015. The third book, ''March: Book Three'' was released August 2, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/03/07/exclusive-rep-john-lewis-on-trump-and-his-new-memoir-march-book-three/|title=Exclusive: Rep.

==Plot==
===''Book One''===
[[File:Bloody Sunday-Alabama police attack.jpeg|thumb|left|The book opens with the March 7, 1965, confrontation between civil rights activists and Alabama State troopers on the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] during "[[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]".]]
On March 7, 1965, John Lewis, a young man, stands on the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in [[Selma, Alabama]] with fellow civil rights activists during the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] on "Bloody Sunday". They are confronted by Alabama state troopers, who order the protestors to turn around. When the protestors refuse, the troopers attack them, beating them and dousing them with tear gas.

The scene cuts to the book's framing sequence, set on January 20, 2009, with Lewis, now a U.S. congressman for [[Georgia's 5th congressional district]], waking up and preparing for the [[first inauguration of Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=VAJQA/&gt; He is greeted at his office by a woman from Atlanta and her two young sons, who want to learn about their history.

Lewis begins telling the family his life story, beginning as a young boy taking care of his parents' chickens on the 110 acres of cotton, corn and peanut fields in [[Pike County, Alabama]] that his father bought for $300 cash in 1940. Though Lewis was fond of his chickens and took pride in their care, he really wanted to be a preacher when he grew up, having been inspired by the Bible that an uncle of his gave him for Christmas when he was four years old. By the time he was five, he could read it by himself, having been particularly captivated by the passage in [[Gospel of John|John]] {{Bibleref2|John|1:29|NKJV|1:29}} "Behold the lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world." As Lewis grew older, he began spending more time doing schoolwork, studying and learning more about what was happening in the world around him, which would later lead to his involvement in the Civil Rights Movement.

Although his parents had raised him to stay out of trouble, other members of his family encourage his interests in civil rights, such as his maternal uncle Otis Carter, a teacher and school principal who had long noted something special in Lewis. Carter took Lewis on Lewis' first trip north in June 1951, driving through the [[segregated South]] to [[Buffalo, New York]], whose busy and unsegregated urban life was an "otherworldly experience" for young Lewis. Though happy when he returned home, home never felt the same to him. When he started school again months later, he began riding the bus to school, whose segregated nature was another reminder of how different the lives of Lewis and his siblings were from those of white children. Though Lewis enjoyed school, it was sometimes a luxury his family could not afford during planting and harvesting season, when they kept him at home to work on the farm. Lewis responded by sneaking off to school, despite scoldings by his father. In May 1954, near the end of Lewis' freshman year in high school, when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka]]'' case ruled public school segregation unconstitutional, Lewis thought it would improve his schooling, but his parents continued to advise him to not cause trouble. He also noticed that the injustices against blacks were not mentioned by local church ministers and that his minister drove a very nice automobile. One Sunday morning in early 1955, Lewis was listening to the radio station [[WZKD|WRMA Montgomery]], when he heard a sermon by [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Profoundly inspired by King's [[social gospel]] and other aspects of the Civil Rights Movement, Lewis, five days before his sixteenth birthday, preached his first public sermon. This event was publicized in the ''[[Montgomery Advertiser]]'', marking the first time Lewis saw his name in print. Lewis subsequently attended [[American Baptist Theological Seminary]] in Nashville while washing dishes to make money. Wanting to do more for the movement, he repeatedly applied as a transfer student to [[Troy University]], where no black student was allowed, only to be rejected. Lewis wrote to civil rights leaders [[Ralph Abernathy]] and [[Fred Gray (attorney)|Fred Gray]], who arranged a meeting between Lewis and King. King explained that to attend Troy, they would have to sue the state of Alabama and the Board of Education and that because Lewis was not old enough to file a suit, he would have to get his parents' permission. Fearful for both their lives and those of their loved ones, Lewis' parents refused.

By March 1958, Lewis was attending First Baptist Church in Nashville, and participated in workshops on [[nonviolence]] organized by [[Vanderbilt University Divinity School]] student [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], who represented the Fellowship of Reconciliation (F.O.R.), a pacifist group committed to nonviolence. F.O.R. published a comic book, ''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]'', that explained how to implement passive resistance as a tool for desegregation. As the group prepared to conduct a [[sit-in]] at a department store lunch counter, the [[Greensboro Four]], inspired by ''The Montgomery Story'', conducted one of their own in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] on February 1, 1960. On February 7, [[Nashville sit-ins|the Nashville group]] conducted theirs, occupying a lunch counter at a local [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] store, refusing to cease amid verbal abuse by whites and the closing of the counter by the establishment. The group repeated this at other stores and remained steadfast even when whites began inflicting physical violence upon them. The group was eventually arrested on February 27, 1960, the first of many for Lewis, but the lunch counters continued to fill with activists, as did the jails. Declining the jail's reduction of their bail from $100 to $5 each, the police eventually released Lewis' group later that night.

The activists were later convicted of disturbing the peace, and when they refused to pay the fines levied against them, they were given prison sentences, outraging the country and inspiring more sit-ins. Nashville Mayor [[Ben West]] ordered their release on March 3 and formed a biracial committee to study segregation in the city, asking the group to temporarily halt the sit-ins while the committee worked, to which Lewis' group agreed. When Vanderbilt University threatened to fire Lawson, dozens of faculty and staff threatened to resign in protest, making national headlines. On March 25, the group, numbering over 100, marched to nine downtown stores. Within local churches, the black community organized a boycott of all downtown stores, and the group resumed the sit-ins, rejecting the committee's suggestion for a "partial integration", which they viewed as indistinguishable from partial segregation. On April 19, dynamite was thrown at the house of [[Alexander Looby]], an acquaintance and lawyer of the activists, and in response, thousands of protestors gathered at [[Tennessee State University]] to march on City Hall. Confronted by activist [[Diane Nash]], Mayor West stated that he would do all he could to enforce the law without prejudice, and appealed to citizens to end discrimination, but could not force store owners to serve those they did not wish to. The next evening, Dr. King arrived to speak, and on May 10, six downtown stores served food to black customers for the first time in the city's history.

===''Book Two''===
Book Two begins in 1961, when the [[Freedom Riders]] began riding interstate buses inside the Deep South.  Racials tensions contributed to the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Birmingham Church Bombing]] in September 1963. The bombing marked a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement and contributed to support for passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].

===''Book Three''===
Book Three follows at the end of 1963, when the Civil Rights Movement had the full attention of the country, and as a chairman of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), Lewis is helps to guide the movement. SNCC continues to force the nation to confront its injustice and racism but the danger grows with more Jim Crow laws with the threats of violence and death. Lewis and an army of activists launch a series of campaigns, including the Freedom Vote and Mississippi Freedom Summer. The movement to give voting rights to all people that resulted in various [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] came to a historic showdown with [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]] in [[Selma, Alabama]].

Jim Johnson of [[Comic Book Resources]] gave the book four and a half out of five stars, calling it "an excellent and fascinating historical account" of Lewis' life and "an absolutely wonderful story about one man who played a very important role in one of this country's most important social revolutions, and continues to play an important part to this very day". Johnson further commented, "Powell's washed-out greytones combine with Congressman Lewis and Aydin's captivating words and story to give the entire account the feel of a compelling, period documentary."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Jim (August 14, 2013).

Noah Sharma of Weekly Comic Book Review gave ''March Book One'' [[Academic grading in the United States|a grade of A−]], calling it "an artful and important graphic novel". Sharma praised Lewis as a talented storyteller, called the dialogue "sharp and cleverly delivered" and remarked that Powell "fills his panels with depth and vibrancy". Sharma concluded, "The narrative tools employed by ''March'' are simple ones, but they form together to create something moving and complex. Aydin and Powell know when to let their art support the congressman and when to let his experience speak for itself."&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Noah (August 20, 2013).

American actor '''[[Mr. T]]''' has headlined in a number of '''[[comic books]]''' both under his own stage name and in conjunction with his role on the TV Series ''[[The A-Team]]''.

==Comics==
===Mr. T and the T-Force===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Mr. T and the T-Force]] --&gt;

''Mr. T and the T-Force'' was released in [[1993 in comics|1993]] by [[NOW Comics]]. It was written [[Pete Stone]]  with art by [[Neal Adams]] and then various creative teams following their run.

The series apparently lasted 14 consecutive issues, not including a 1994 annual and various editions of #1, before closing when [[NOW Comics]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; went out of business. This figure may be incorrect however, with the eleventh issue possibly being the final issue produced.

Many, if not all, issues of ''Mr. T and the T-Force'' included Mr. T trading cards.

===Mr. T===
Another comic version, ''Mr. T'', appeared in [[2005 in comics|2005]] from short-lived British comic publisher APComics. It was pitched to the publisher by writer [[Chris Bunting]] who was joined with pencils by Neil Edwards, inks by [[Randy Emberlin]] and with colours by Don Mackinnon. Mr. T was also listed as a Creative Supervisor on the series and did a round of interviews as publicity for the series launch.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001558/publicity Mr. T - Publicity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The series got a lot of press interest,&lt;ref&gt;[http://writinguk.blogspot.com/2005/06/t-up.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; announcing itself to be one of the biggest licensing deals in British comic's history.  Ultimately, it had a very short life, most probably due to the closure of APComics.  It featured as a six-page preview of APComics upcoming comics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/news/111070737923326.htm MR.T #1 Incentive from APComics: News Bulletins - Comics Bulletin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021034037/http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/news/111070737923326.htm |date=2006-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcultureshock.com/reviews.php?id=4542 APComics 2005 Preview » PopCultureShock&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070702164815/http://www.popcultureshock.com/reviews.php?id=4542 |date=2007-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then two issues were released. Apparently the second issue, released several months after the first, was released out of license by APComics and many copies were ordered to be immediately withdrawn.

Richard Emms, owner of APComics, 'left' for [[Markosia]] and with him went a number of titles. However, ''Mr. T ''was not one of those and there were a variety of complaints including of non-payment emerging from creatives working on ''Mr. T''. That appears to have been settled by APComics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&amp;article=2230 Comic Book Resources - Comic Book News, Reviews and Commentary - Updated Daily!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], [[Comic Book Resources]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=40794 Apc Boss Richard Emms Quits - Joins Markosia]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Newsarama]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 new cover art from [[Jim Steranko]] appeared as a US publisher had temporary permission to use the license for the third and final issue in the comic book series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://writinguk.blogspot.com/2006/03/hangin-with-jim-steranko-and-mrt.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February [[2008 in comics|2008]] publisher Mohawk Media released an all-new ''Mr. T'' [[graphic novel]].

===A-Team comics===
{{main| The A-Team (comics)}}

Mr. T appeared, as B. A. Baracus, in The ''A-Team'' comic adaptation that appeared in ''[[Look-In]]'' for throughout the 1980s. An ''A-Team'' strip also ran in ''[[TV Comic]]'' sold in UK. Length of run unknown.

From {{start date|1983}} to {{end date|1984}}, [[Marvel Comics]] released an ''A-Team'' title which ran for 3 issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comics-db.com/Marvel_Comics/A/The_A-Team/ |title=The A-Team Comic Book Resource |publisher=Comics-db.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175508/http://www.comics-db.com/Marvel_Comics/A/The_A-Team/ |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the huge popularity of both comics and The ''A-Team'' show at that time, information which lists this as a 3-issue 'mini-series' is probably accurate. The Marvel Comics series was sold individually then released in "packs": one pack contained the first 2 issues, the next all 3 issues. Each pack was a sealed transparent bag featuring Marvel's logo and a picture of Spider-Man. Marvel released the series in a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] called ''The A-Team Storybook.'' ({{ISBN|0517553856}}).

The Marvel US comics were also reprinted by [[Marvel UK]] in a variety of formats including hardback annual book and ''The A-Team Summer Special 1985'' and The ''A-Team Summer Special #2'' (1986). The final Marvel UK hardback ''A-Team'' annual was released in 1991, several years after the cancellation of The ''A-Team'' TV series, showing its continued popularity in the UK despite this.

In 2010, [[IDW Publishing]] issued several comic books tying in with the [[The A-Team (film)|''A-Team'' film]], however neither of these feature Mr. T, but rather actor [[Quinton Jackson]], who took over the role of B. A. Baracus for the film.

[[File:Map of North America, blackout 2003.svg|thumb|300px|This image shows states and provinces that experienced [[power outage]]s. Not all areas within these political boundaries were affected.]]

The '''Northeast blackout of 2003''' was a widespread [[power outage]] throughout parts of the [[northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and [[Midwestern United States]] and the Canadian province of [[Ontario]] on August 14, 2003, just after 4:10&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]].&lt;ref name = "Genscape"&gt;{{cite press release| url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/what-caused-the-power-blackout-to-spread-so-widely-and-so-fast-genscapes-unique-data-will-help-answer-that-question-70952022.html| title = What Caused the Power Blackout To Spread So Widely and So Fast?|access-date= July 13, 2011| date = August 15, 2003| publisher =Genscape|via=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some power was restored by 11 p.m. Most did not get their power back until two days later. In other areas, it took nearly a week or two for power to be restored.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; At the time, it was the world's second [[List of major power outages#Largest|most widespread blackout in history]], after the [[1999 Southern Brazil blackout]].&lt;ref name = "CBC archived news clip"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/2003-the-great-north-america-blackout |title=2003: The great North America blackout |website=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=August 14, 2003 |access-date=September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/poweroutage/timeline.html| title = INDEPTH: Power Outage {{!}} Timeline|access-date= September 15, 2008| date = August 18, 2004| work = CBC News |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203032628/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/poweroutage/timeline.html |archive-date=February 3, 2013 &lt;!-- NOTE: later copies are just archives of the "Sorry, we can't find the page you requested." page --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outage, which was much more widespread than the [[Northeast blackout of 1965|Northeast Blackout of 1965]], affected an estimated 10 million people in Ontario and 45 million people in eight U.S. states.

The blackout's primary cause was a [[software bug]] in the alarm system at the control room of [[FirstEnergy Corporation]], an [[Akron, Ohio]]–based company, causing operators to remain unaware of the need to re-distribute load after overloaded transmission lines drooped into foliage. What should have been a manageable local blackout cascaded into collapse of the entire electric grid.

{{TOC limit|limit=4}}

==Immediate impact==
According to the New York Independent System Operator ([[NYISO]]) – the [[Independent System Operator|ISO]] responsible for managing the [[New York (state)|New York]] state [[electrical grid|power grid]] – a 3,500 [[megawatt]] power surge (towards Ontario) affected the transmission grid at 4:10:39&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT.&lt;ref name="NYISO"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hepg/Papers/NYISO.blackout.report.8.Jan.04.pdf| title = Interim Report on the August 14, 2003, Blackout| date = January 8, 2004| format = PDF| publisher = New York Independent System Operator|access-date= September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next 30 minutes, to 4:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT, outages were reported in parts of [[Ohio]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Michigan]], and [[New Jersey]]: [[Cleveland]], [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[New York City]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]] and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] counties, [[Baltimore]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Detroit]], and parts of [[New Jersey]], including the city of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].

This was followed by outages in other areas initially unaffected, including all of New York City, portions of southern New York state, New Jersey, [[Vermont]], [[Connecticut]], and [[Toronto]], as well as most of the province of [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/08/14/power.outage/ |title=Major power outage hits New York, other large cities |website=[[CNN]] |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] |access-date=September 16, 2008 |date=August 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Eventually, a large, somewhat triangular area bounded by [[Lansing, Michigan]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]], the shore of [[James Bay]], [[Ottawa]], New York, and Toledo was left without power.

According to the official analysis of the blackout prepared by the US and Canadian governments, more than 508 generating units at 265 power plants shut down during the outage. In the minutes before the event, the NYISO-managed power system was carrying 28,700 MW of load. At the height of the outage, the load had dropped to 5,716 MW, a loss of 80%.&lt;ref name="NYISO" /&gt;

Essential services remained in operation in some of these areas. In others, backup generation systems failed. Telephone networks generally remained operational, but the increased demand triggered by the blackout left many circuits overloaded. Water systems in several cities lost pressure, forcing [[boil-water advisory|boil-water advisories]] to be put into effect. [[Mobile phone|Cellular service]] was interrupted as mobile networks were overloaded with the increase in volume of calls. Major [[Cellular network|cellular]] providers continued to operate on standby generator power.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Television and radio stations remained on the air, with the help of [[Emergency power system|backup generator]]s, although some stations were knocked off the air for periods ranging from several hours to the length of the entire blackout.{{Vague|Which stations? "Some" and "Most" don't mean anything.|date=June 2010}}

It was a hot day (over {{convert|31|C|F|disp=x|, or }}) in much of the affected region, and the heat played a role in the initial event that triggered the wider power outage. The high ambient temperature increased energy demand, as people across the region turned on fans and air conditioning. This caused the power lines to sag as higher currents heated the lines.

In areas where power remained off after nightfall, the [[Milky Way]] and orbiting artificial [[satellite]]s became visible to the naked eye in metropolitan areas where they cannot ordinarily be seen due to the effects of particulate [[air pollution|air]] and [[light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoislighting.org/loss.html |title=The Costs Of Losing Our Night Skies |publisher=www.illinoislighting.org |date=August 14, 2003 |access-date=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the [[Amtrak]] [[Northeast Corridor]] service was interrupted, as it uses electric locomotives; electrified commuter railways also shut down.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; [[Via Rail]] in Canada was able to continue most of its service. The power outage's effects on international air transport and financial markets were widespread.{{Vague|Specifics, please.|date=June 2010}} The reliability of the electrical grid was called into question.

===Unaffected regions===
Within the area affected, about 200,000 people continued to have power – in the [[Niagara Peninsula]] of Ontario; the easternmost corner of Ontario (centered on [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]]); the Buffalo, NY area, excluding southern Erie county, along the shore of Lake Huron via a feeder line to Owen Sound from Bruce Nuclear Generating Station. Three of the four Bruce B units were able to throttle back their output without a complete shutdown, then reconnect to the grid within five hours; the portion of New York state including parts of Albany and north and west of Albany; a small pocket of mid-east Michigan; the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]]; and small pockets in New Jersey. The unaffected area was protected by transmission circuit devices at the [[Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations]] in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], (coincidentally, the starting point of the [[Northeast blackout of 1965]]) at a switching station of the hydroelectric power station in Cornwall, as well as central New York state. [[Philadelphia]] and the surrounding [[mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] areas were also completely unaffected because [[PJM Interconnection|PJM]] disconnected them.&lt;ref name="NYISO" /&gt; The Saint Clair power plant{{which|date=October 2017}} in [[East China Township, Michigan]], remained online for about 36 hours, and residents were informed that the plant would have to shut down in order to facilitate the reboot of the whole system.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Causes==
[[File:Northeast blackout 2003.gif|thumb|300px|Satellite imagery of the [[Northeastern United States]] taken before and during the blackout]]

===Background===
The load on any power network must be immediately matched by its supply and its ability to transmit that power. Any [[overcurrent|overload]] of a power line or generator can cause costly damage, so the affected device is disconnected from the network if an overload is detected.

The [[electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]] of a power line causes it to produce more heat as the [[electric current|current]] it carries increases. If this heat is not sufficiently dissipated, the metal conductor in the line will expand and lengthen, so that it sags between supporting structures. If the line sags too low, a [[electric arc|flash over]] to nearby objects (such as trees) may occur, causing a [[Transient (oscillation)|transient]] increase in current. Automatic [[protective relay]]s detect the excessively high current and quickly disconnect the line, with the load previously carried by the line transferred to other lines. If the other lines do not have enough spare capacity to accommodate the extra current, their overload protection will react as well, causing a [[cascading failure]].

System operators are responsible for ensuring that power supply and loads remain balanced, and for keeping the system within safe operational limits such that no single fault can cause the system to fail. After a failure affecting their system, operators must obtain more power from generators or other regions or "shed load" (meaning to intentionally cut power or [[Brownout (electricity)|reduce voltage]] to a given area) until they can be sure that the worst remaining possible failure anywhere in the system will not cause a system collapse. In an emergency, they are expected to immediately shed load as required to bring the system into balance.

To assist the operators there are computer systems, with backups, which issue alarms when there are faults in the transmission or generation system. [[Power flow study|Power flow modeling tools]] let them analyze the current state of their network, predict whether any parts of it may be overloaded, and predict the worst possible failure remaining, so that they can change the distribution of [[Electricity generation|generation]] or reconfigure the transmission system to prevent a failure should this situation occur. If the computer systems and their backups fail, the operators are required to monitor the grid manually, instead of relying on computer alerts. If they cannot interpret the current state of the power grid in such an event, they follow a contingency plan, contacting other plant and grid operators by telephone if necessary. If there is a failure, they are also required to notify adjacent areas which may be affected, so those can predict the possible effects on their own systems.

===Investigation efforts===
A joint federal task force was formed by the governments of Canada and the U.S. to oversee the investigation and report directly to Ottawa and Washington. The task force was led by then-Canadian Natural Resource Minister [[Herb Dhaliwal]] and [[United States Secretary of Energy|U.S. Energy Secretary]] [[Spencer Abraham]].

In addition to determining the initial cause of the cascading failure, the investigation of the incident also included an examination of the failure of safeguards designed to prevent a repetition of the [[Northeast blackout of 1965]]. The [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]], a joint Canada-U.S. council, is responsible for dealing with these issues.

On November 19, 2003, Abraham said his department would not seek to punish FirstEnergy Corp for its role in the blackout because current U.S. law does not require electric reliability standards. Abraham stated, "The absence of enforceable reliability standards creates a situation in which there are limits in terms of federal level punishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=DOE chief sees no blackout penalty for FirstEnergy| url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/newswire/2003/11/19/rtr1153863.html|periodical=[[Forbes]]| publisher=Forbes, LLC|access-date=March 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040224080845/http://www.forbes.com/markets/newswire/2003/11/19/rtr1153863.html|archive-date=February 24, 2004| date=November 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Findings===
In February 2004, the U.S.-Canada Power System Outage Task Force released their final report, placing the causes of the blackout into four groups:&lt;ref name=taskforcefinal&gt;{{cite report |date=April 2004 |title=Final Report on the August 14, 2003 Blackout in the United States and Canada: Causes and Recommendations |url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/BlackoutFinal-Web.pdf |publisher=U.S./Canada Power System Outage Task Force |website=Energy.gov - Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability|format=PDF|agency=[[United States Department of Energy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[FirstEnergy]] (FE) and its reliability council "failed to assess and understand the inadequacies of FE's system, particularly with respect to voltage instability and the vulnerability of the Cleveland-Akron area, and FE did not operate its system with appropriate voltage criteria."
# FirstEnergy "did not recognize or understand the deteriorating condition of its system."
# FirstEnergy "failed to manage adequately tree growth in its transmission rights-of-way."
# Finally, the "failure of the interconnected grid's reliability organizations to provide effective real-time diagnostic support."

The report states that a generating plant in [[Eastlake, Ohio]], a suburb of Cleveland, went offline amid high electrical demand, putting a strain on high-voltage power lines (located in a distant rural setting) which later went out of service when they came in contact with "overgrown trees". This trip caused load to transfer to other transmission lines, which were not able to bear the load, tripping their breakers. Once these multiple trips occurred, multiple generators suddenly lost parts of their loads, so they accelerated out of phase with the grid at different rates, and tripped out to prevent damage. The cascading effect that resulted ultimately forced the shutdown of more than 100 power plants.

====Computer failure====
A [[software bug]] known as a [[race condition]] {{vague|date=August 2018}}existed in [[General Electric]] Energy's [[Unix]]-based [http://site.ge-energy.com/prod_serv/products/td_operations/en/xa21.htm XA/21] [[energy management system]]. Once triggered, the bug stalled FirstEnergy's control room alarm system for over an hour. System operators were unaware of the malfunction. The failure deprived them of both audio and visual alerts for important changes in system state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kevin Poulsen |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/8016 |title=Software Bug Contributed to Blackout |publisher=Securityfocus.com |date=February 11, 2004 |access-date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kevin Poulsen |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/8412 |title=Tracking the blackout bug |publisher=Securityfocus.com |date=April 7, 2004 |access-date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unprocessed events queued up after the alarm system failure and the primary [[Application server|server]] failed within 30 minutes. Then all applications (including the stalled alarm system) were automatically transferred to the backup server, which itself failed at 14:54. The server failures slowed the screen refresh rate of the operators' computer consoles from 1–3 seconds to 59 seconds per screen. The lack of alarms led operators to dismiss a call from American Electric Power about the tripping and reclosure of a 345 kV shared line in northeast Ohio. But by 15:42, after the control room itself lost power, control room operators informed technical support (who were already troubleshooting the issue) of the alarm system problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 13, 2004 |title=Technical Analysis of the August 14, 2003, Blackout: What Happened, Why, and What Did We Learn? |url=http://www.nerc.com/docs/docs/blackout/NERC_Final_Blackout_Report_07_13_04.pdf |publisher=[[North American Electric Reliability Council]] |access-date=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 12:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. Incorrect [[telemetry]] data renders inoperative the [[state observer|state estimator]], a power flow monitoring tool operated by the Indiana-based [[Midcontinent Independent System Operator|Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator]] (MISO). An operator corrects the telemetry problem, but forgets to restart the monitoring tool.
* 1:31&amp;nbsp;p.m. The [[Eastlake, Ohio]] generating plant shuts down. The plant is owned by [[FirstEnergy]], an [[Akron, Ohio]]-based company.
* 2:02&amp;nbsp;p.m. The first of several 345 [[kilovolt|kV]] [[Overhead power line|overhead transmission lines]] in northeast Ohio fails due to contact with a tree in [[Walton Hills, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John P. |last=Coyne |url=http://www.cleveland.com/blackout/index.ssf?/blackout/more/1061717873203660.html |title=Boom signaled power-line arc in Walton Hills |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=August 24, 2003 |access-date=August 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217151746/http://www.cleveland.com/blackout/index.ssf?%2Fblackout%2Fmore%2F1061717873203660.html |archive-date=December 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{coord|41|21|22|N|81|34|10|W}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* 2:14&amp;nbsp;p.m. An alarm system fails at FirstEnergy's control room and is not repaired.
* 3:05&amp;nbsp;p.m. A 345 kV transmission line known as the Chamberlin-Harding line sags into a tree and trips in [[Parma, Ohio|Parma]], south of Cleveland.
* 3:17&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Brownout (electricity)|Voltage dips temporarily]] on the Ohio portion of the grid. Controllers take no action.
* 3:32&amp;nbsp;p.m. Power shifted by the first failure onto another 345 kV power line, the Hanna-Juniper interconnection, causes it to sag into a tree, bringing it offline as well. While MISO and FirstEnergy controllers concentrate on understanding the failures, they fail to inform system controllers in nearby states.
* 3:39&amp;nbsp;p.m. A FirstEnergy 138 kV line trips in northern Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://eioc.pnl.gov/research/2003blackout.stm| title=Looking back at the 2003 blackout| publisher=[[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]]|access-date=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 3:41&amp;nbsp;p.m. A [[circuit breaker]] connecting FirstEnergy's grid with that of [[American Electric Power]] is [[Circuit breaker|tripped]] as a 345 kV power line (Star-South Canton interconnection) and fifteen 138 kV lines fail in rapid succession in northern Ohio.
* 3:46&amp;nbsp;p.m. A fifth 345 kV line, the Tidd-Canton Central line, trips offline.
* 4:05:57&amp;nbsp;p.m. The Sammis-Star 345 kV line trips due to under voltage and over current interpreted as a short circuit. Later analysis suggests that the blackout could have been averted before this failure by cutting 1.5 GW of load in the Cleveland–Akron area.
* 4:06–4:08&amp;nbsp;p.m. A sustained power surge north toward Cleveland overloads three 138 kV lines.
* 4:09:02&amp;nbsp;p.m. Voltage sags deeply as Ohio draws 2 [[gigawatt|GW]] of power from Michigan, creating simultaneous under voltage and over current conditions as power attempts to flow in such a way as to rebalance the system's voltage.
* 4:10:34&amp;nbsp;p.m. Many transmission lines trip out, first in Michigan and then in Ohio, blocking the eastward flow of power around the south shore of [[Lake Erie]] from [[Toledo, Ohio]], east through [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], and into southern Erie county, but not most of the [[Buffalo, New York]], metropolitan area. Suddenly bereft of demand, generating stations go offline, creating a huge power deficit. In seconds, power surges in from the east, overloading east-coast power plants whose generators go offline as a protective measure, and the blackout is on.
* 4:10:37&amp;nbsp;p.m. The eastern and western Michigan power grids disconnect from each other. Two 345 kV lines in [[Michigan]] trip. A line that runs from [[Grand Ledge, Michigan|Grand Ledge]] to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] known as the Oneida-Majestic interconnection trips. A short time later, a line running from [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]] south to [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] in [[Consumers Energy]]'s system known as the Hampton-Thetford line also trips.
* 4:10:38&amp;nbsp;p.m. Cleveland separates from the Pennsylvania grid.
* 4:10:39&amp;nbsp;p.m. 3.7 GW power flows from the east along the north shore of Lake Erie, through Ontario to southern Michigan and northern Ohio, a flow more than ten times greater than the condition 30 seconds earlier, causing a voltage drop across the system.
* 4:10:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. Flow flips to 2 GW eastward from Michigan through Ontario (a net reversal of 5.7 GW of power), then reverses back westward again within a half second.
* 4:10:43&amp;nbsp;p.m. International connections between the United States and Canada start to fail.
* 4:10:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. Northwestern Ontario separates from the east when the Wawa-Marathon 230 kV line north of [[Lake Superior]] disconnects. The first Ontario power plants go offline in response to the unstable voltage and current demand on the system.
* 4:10:46&amp;nbsp;p.m. New York separates from the [[New England]] grid.
* 4:10:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. Ontario separates from the western New York grid.
* 4:11:57&amp;nbsp;p.m. The Keith-Waterman, Bunce Creek-Scott 230 kV lines and the [[St. Clair, Michigan|St. Clair]]–[[Lambton County|Lambton]] #1 230 kV line and #2 345 kV line between Michigan and Ontario fail.
* 4:12:03&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Windsor, Ontario]], and surrounding areas drop off the grid.
* 4:12:58&amp;nbsp;p.m. Northern [[New Jersey]] separates its power-grids from [[New York City|New York]] and the [[Philadelphia]] area, causing a cascade of failing secondary generator plants along the New Jersey coast and throughout the inland regions west.
* 4:13&amp;nbsp;p.m. End of [[cascading failure]]. 256 power plants are off-line, 85% of which went offline after the grid separations occurred, most due to the action of automatic protective controls.

[[Gatineau]] had power. One may have seen the drastic cutoff of areas still having power when they were crossing the [[Portage Bridge]] between Gatineau and [[Ottawa]] – the cutoff was at the provincial line (street lights on the bridge were still lit on the Quebec side of the structure).&lt;/small&gt;
|}

===Affected infrastructure===

====Power generation====
With the power fluctuations on the grid, power plants automatically went into "safe mode" to prevent damage in the case of an overload. This put much of the nuclear power offline until those plants could be slowly taken out of "safe mode". In the meantime, all available hydro-electric plants (as well as many coal- and oil-fired plants) were brought online, bringing some electrical power to the areas immediately surrounding the plants by the morning of August 15. Homes and businesses both in the affected area and in nearby areas were requested to limit power usage until the grid was back to full power.

====Water supply====
Some areas lost water pressure because pumps lacked power. This loss of pressure caused potential contamination of the water supply. Four million customers of the Detroit water system in eight counties were under a [[boil-water advisory]] until August 18, four days after the initial outage. One county, [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb]], ordered all 2,300 restaurants closed until they were decontaminated after the advisory was lifted. Twenty people living on the [[St. Clair River]] claim to have been sickened after bathing in the river during the blackout. The accidental release of 140&amp;nbsp;kg (310&amp;nbsp;lb) of [[vinyl chloride]] from a [[Sarnia|Sarnia, Ontario]] chemical plant was not revealed until five days later. Cleveland also lost water pressure and instituted a boil water advisory. Cleveland and New York had [[sewage]] spills into waterways, requiring beach closures. [[Newark, New Jersey]], and northern cities had major sewage spills into the [[Passaic River|Passaic]] and [[Hackensack River|Hackensack]] rivers, which flow directly to the Atlantic Ocean. [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] lost power to sewage pumps, causing raw waste to be dumped into the [[Cataraqui River]] at the base of the [[Rideau Canal]].

====Transportation====
[[File:Streetcar Toronto 2003 Blackout.jpg|thumb|A streetcar left stranded by the blackout in [[Toronto]]]]

[[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] railroad service was stopped north of [[Philadelphia]], and all trains running into and out of New York City were shut down, initially including the [[Long Island Rail Road]] and the [[Metro-North Railroad]]; both were able to establish a bare-bones "all-diesel" service by the next morning. Canada's [[Via Rail]], which serves Toronto and [[Montreal]], had a few service delays before returning to normal the next morning.

Passenger screenings at affected airports ceased. Regional airports were shut down for this reason. In New York, flights were cancelled even after power had been restored to the airports because of difficulties accessing "electronic-ticket" information. [[Air Canada]] flights remained grounded on the morning of August 15 due to reliable power not having been restored to its [[Mississauga]] control center. It expected to resume operations by midday. This problem affected all Air Canada service and canceled the most heavily traveled flights to [[Metropolitan Halifax|Halifax]] and [[Vancouver]]. At [[Chicago]]'s [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway International Airport]], [[Southwest Airlines]] employees spent 48 hours dealing with the disorder caused by the blackout's sudden incidence.&lt;ref&gt;The [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] reality television series ''Airline'' episode titled "Beyond Their Control" features Southwest employees dealing with the flight interruptions caused by the blackout.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many gas stations were unable to pump fuel due to lack of electricity. In [[North Bay, Ontario]], for instance, a long line of [[transport truck]]s was held up, unable to go further west to [[Manitoba]] without refueling. In some cities, traffic problems were compounded by motorists who simply drove until their cars ran out of gas on the highway. Gas stations operating in pockets of [[Burlington, Ontario]], that had power were reported to be charging prices up to $3.78 per US gallon (99.9 cents/Litre) when the going rate prior to the blackout was lower than $2.65/gallon (70¢/L). Customers still lined up for hours to pay prices many people considered [[price gouging]]. Station operators claimed that they had a limited supply of gasoline and did not know when their tanks would be refilled, prompting the drastic price increases.

Many oil refineries on the East Coast of the United States shut down as a result of the blackout, and were slow to resume gasoline production. As a result, gasoline prices were expected to rise approximately 10 cents/gallon (3¢/L) in the United States. In Canada, gasoline [[rationing]] was also considered by the authorities.

====Communication====
Cellular communication devices were disrupted. This was mainly due to the loss of backup power at the cellular sites where generators ran out of fuel. Where cell sites remained up, some cell phones still went out of service as their batteries ran out of charge without a power source to recharge from. Wired [[telephone line]]s continued to work, although some systems were overwhelmed by the volume of traffic, and millions of home users had only cordless telephones depending on house current. Most New York and many Ontario radio stations were momentarily knocked off the air before returning with backup power.

[[Cable television]] systems were disabled, and in areas that had power restored (and had power to their television sets), cable subscribers could not receive information until power was restored to the cable provider. Those who relied on the [[Internet]] were similarly disconnected from their news source for the duration of the blackout, with the exception of [[dial-up]] access from [[laptop]] computers, which were widely reported to work until the batteries ran out of charge. Information was available by over-the-air TV and radio reception for those who were equipped to receive TV and/or audio in that way.

The blackout affected communications well outside the immediate area of power outage. The New Jersey-based internet operations of [[Advance Publications]] were among those knocked out by the blackout. As a result, the internet editions of Advance newspapers as far removed from the blackout area as ''[[The Birmingham News]]'', the New Orleans ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', and ''[[The Oregonian]]'' were offline for days.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite news|title=Blackout Stops Presses, Shuts Web Sites|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-108017766.html|periodical=Newsinc|date=August 18, 2003|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amateur radio]] operators passed emergency communications during the blackout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=October 2003| author=Rick Lindquist, N1RL| publisher=''[[QST]]''| title=Hams a Bright Spot during Power Blackout| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Industry====
Large numbers of factories were closed in the affected area, and others outside the area were forced to close or slow work because of supply problems and the need to conserve energy while the grid was being stabilized. At one point a 7-hour wait developed for trucks crossing the [[Ambassador Bridge]] between [[Detroit]] and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] due to the lack of electronic border check systems. Freeway congestion in affected areas affected the "[[Just in time (business)|just in time]]" (JIT) supply system. Some industries (including the auto industry) did not return to full production until August 22.

===By region===

====New York====

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
[[File:2003 New York City blackout.jpg|thumb|250px|People walking across the [[Queensboro Bridge]] in [[New York City]] during the blackout]]

Almost the entire state of [[New York (state)|New York]] lost power. Exceptions included [[Freeport, New York|Freeport]] and [[Rockville Centre, New York|Rockville Centre]] on [[Long Island]], which relied on localized power plants; the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], where power dipped briefly (a few areas, such as portions of [[Latham, New York]], didn't lose power at all); the southernmost areas of the [[Southern Tier]] of [[Upstate New York]], mostly near [[Waverly, Tioga County, New York|Waverly]], which relied on power from [[Pennsylvania]]; the city of [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]]; [[Starrett City, Brooklyn]], which has auxiliary power; most of the city of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; and pockets of [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]] in the Buffalo area, running off [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|university power]]. There were also some small pockets of power in the suburbs of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], as a few smaller power companies operating in those areas were able to keep running. The [[North Shore Towers]] complex was unaffected by the blackout due to their on-site self-generating power plant. Power was also available at the [[Kodak Park]] facility and its surrounding neighborhood in the city. Power was lost at the [[Oak Hill Country Club]] in nearby [[Pittsford, New York|Pittsford]], where the [[2003 PGA Championship]] was being played, which caused minor interruptions to the tournament. Also, that evening's [[Major League Baseball]] game between the [[New York Mets]] and the [[San Francisco Giants]] at [[Shea Stadium]] was postponed. In New York, all prisons were blacked out and switched to generator power. The two [[Indian Point Energy Center|Indian Point nuclear reactors]] on the [[Hudson River]] near [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]], the two reactors at [[Nine Mile Point Nuclear Generating Station|Nine Mile Point]] nuclear plant, the single reactor at [[Ginna Nuclear Generating Station|Ginna]] nuclear plant near Rochester, and the [[James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant|FitzPatrick]] reactor near [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]] all shut down. With three other nuclear plants shut down in Ohio, Michigan, and New Jersey, a total of nine reactors were affected. The governor of New York, [[George Pataki]], declared a [[state of emergency]].

[[Verizon Communications|Verizon]]'s emergency generators failed several times, leaving the [[emergency services number]] [[9-1-1]] out of service for several periods of about a quarter-hour each. New York City's [[3-1-1|311]] information hotline received over 175,000 calls from concerned residents during the weekend. [[Amateur radio operator]]s attached to New York City [[Amateur Radio Emergency Service|ARES]] provided a backup communications link to emergency shelters and hospitals. Amateur radio [[repeater]]s were supplied with emergency power via [[electric generator|generator]]s and batteries and remained functional.

Major U.S. networks ([[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]) and some cable television channels ([[HBO]], [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon]]), centered in [[New York City]], were unable to broadcast normally, so backup stations and flagship transmitters in [[Dallas]] were used for prime-time TV. ABC ran their [[ABC News|news broadcasts]] from [[Washington, D.C.]] instead.

====New York City====
[[Manhattan]], including [[Wall Street]] and the [[headquarters of the United Nations]], was completely shut down, as were all area airports (with the exception of [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh's]] [[Stewart International Airport]], which had once been a military airbase and had its own generators), and all New York-area rail transportation including the [[New York City Subway|subway]], the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] lines between Manhattan and New Jersey, [[New Jersey Transit]]'s [[Northeast Corridor Line|Northeast Corridor]] and [[North Jersey Coast Line|North Jersey Coast]] lines between [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York Penn Station]] and [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Newark Penn Station]], the [[Morris &amp; Essex Lines]] between New York Penn Station and [[Newark Broad Street Station|Newark Broad Street]], the [[Metro-North Railroad]], and the [[Long Island Rail Road]]. Hundreds of people were trapped in elevators; by late evening the [[New York City Fire Department]] had reportedly confirmed that all stalled elevators in approximately 800 Manhattan high-rise office and apartment buildings had been cleared. More than 600 subway and commuter rail cars were trapped between stations; New York's [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] and the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] (which operates the PATH lines) reported that all passengers were evacuated without serious injury. PATH was first to resume subway service on Sixth Avenue (albeit on 15-minute headways) by 6 p.m. that evening.

Without traffic lights, [[gridlock]] was reported as people in [[Lower Manhattan|Lower]] and [[Midtown Manhattan]] fled their offices on foot; for hours into the evening the streets, highways, bridges and tunnels were jammed with traffic and pedestrians leaving Manhattan, though many civilians helped direct traffic. The bus journey from Manhattan to [[Washington, D.C.]] (which normally takes four hours) took more than eight hours, with reports that it took four hours just to get out of Manhattan. Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] advised residents to open their windows, drink plenty of liquids to avoid [[heat stroke]] in the heat, and not to forget their pets. Temperatures were {{convert|92|F}} with high [[humidity]], as New York had just experienced a record-breaking rain spell that had started at the end of July. With cell phone operation mostly stalled by circuit overloads, New Yorkers were lining up 10 deep or more at [[pay phone]]s as [[Public switched telephone network|ordinary telephone service]] remained largely unaffected. Many people found themselves with no phone service at home.

While some commuters were able to find alternate sleeping arrangements, many were left stranded in New York and slept in parks and on the steps of public buildings. While practically all businesses and retail establishments closed down, many bars and pubs reported a brisk business as many New Yorkers took the opportunity to spend the evening "enjoying" the blackout. Tourists' hotel rooms were blacked out except the hallways and most of the restaurants in lobbies gave out free food to guests. Since most perishable items were going to spoil anyway, many restaurants and citizens simply prepared what they could and served it to anyone who wanted it, leading to vast block parties in many New York City neighborhoods. Any ice cream in frozen storage also had to be quickly served to any and all passers by. The [[Indigo Girls]] were scheduled to perform that evening at [[Central Park SummerStage]], and the band took the stage as planned to play one of the only shows in the affected area, using generators that had been filled with fuel that morning. Their performance was not a full-length concert, as they needed to end early to allow all attendees to exit Central Park before dark. The venue also had bathrooms, and vendors cooking food on propane grills.

Forty thousand police officers and the entire fire department were called in to maintain order. At least two fatalities were linked to the use of flames to provide light, and many nonfatal fires also resulted from the use of [[candle]]s. New York City's [[New York City Office of Emergency Management|Office of Emergency Management]] activated its Emergency Operations Center, from which more than 70 agencies coordinated response efforts, which included delivery of portable light towers to unlit intersections, generators and diesel fuel to hospitals, and a portable steam generator necessary to power air conditioning units at the [[American Stock Exchange]].

====New Jersey====
Affected areas included most of [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]], [[Union County, New Jersey|Union]], [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic]], and [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]] counties, including the major cities of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]] and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], although some sections of Newark and [[East Orange, New Jersey|East Orange]] still had power; also, small sections of certain towns in Essex, Hudson, and Union counties had power. Power was returned first to the urban areas because of concerns of safety and unrest. Counties as far south as [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland]] were affected, where power was restored within an hour. Some towns in Bergen County only momentarily lost power, and had wild oscillations in power line voltage, ranging from about 90V to 135V every few minutes for an hour.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The day following the blackout, August 15, the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] stopped collecting tolls until 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.

====Maryland====
The Baltimore-Washington area was not affected other than transportation scheduling.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-08-15/news/0308150275_1_customers-in-maryland-new-jersey-megawatts&lt;/ref&gt;

====Connecticut====
Parts of [[New London County, Connecticut|New London]], [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], were affected, although most of the state had power all evening, aside from a few momentary interruptions that caused computers to reboot. [[Metro-North]] trains stopped and remained on the tracks for hours, until they could be towed to the nearest station. Generally, most of the state east of [[Interstate 91]], and some places west of I-91, had power during the duration of the blackout, with some of [[New Haven]]'s eastern suburbs being seen as the easternmost extreme of the effects of the blackout.

A local controversy ensued in the days after the blackout, when the federal government ordered power companies to energize the [[HVDC]] [[Cross Sound Cable]] between New Haven and [[Long Island]]. This cable had been installed, but not activated due to environment and fishery concerns. The [[State Attorney General|Attorney General]] of Connecticut (and future U.S. Senator), [[Richard Blumenthal]], and the [[Governor of New York]], [[George Pataki]], traded insults over the cable. Connecticut politicians expressed their outrage that the cable was being turned on, since it did not help anyone in Connecticut, as the cable would transport power from Connecticut to Long Island.

====Massachusetts====
A small area of western [[Massachusetts]] was affected. In [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] the event was of sufficient magnitude to reboot some computers, while in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] the effect of the event was enough to cause the automatic startup of commercial and industrial backup generation facilities. Some areas were subjected to lower-than-normal voltage (as low as 100 volts AC) and [[brownout (electricity)|brownout]]s for periods of up to 24 hours. The [[Boston]] area was spared from the blackout.

====Michigan====
About 2.3 million households and businesses were affected, including almost all of [[Metro Detroit]], as well as [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], and surrounding communities in southeast Michigan. The blackout affected three Michigan utilities: [[Detroit Edison]] (whose entire system went down), [[Lansing Board of Water &amp; Light]], and a small portion of [[Consumers Energy]]'s system in the southeastern corner of the state. Word quickly spread to the surrounding areas without power and many flocked to surrounding areas that still had power, resulting in crowded stores, packed restaurants, booked hotels, and long queues for the gas stations in these towns. Locales closest to the affected areas in the northern [[Metro Detroit|Detroit suburbs]] that did not lose power included the areas of [[Oxford, Michigan|Oxford]] and [[Holly, Michigan|Holly]], communities along [[M-24 (Michigan highway)|M-24]] and [[M-15 (Michigan highway)|M-15]], and into the [[Lapeer, Michigan|Lapeer]] and [[Flint/Tri-Cities]] area.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The city limits of [[Brighton, Michigan|Brighton]] and [[Howell, Michigan|Howell]] were unaffected as well, as they received electricity from Consumers Energy via the Genoa-Latson 138KV line which interconnects Detroit Edison and Consumers Energy. Television and radio stations were temporarily knocked off the air and water supplies were disrupted in Detroit due to the failure of electric pumps. Because of the loss of water pressure all water was required to be boiled before use until August 18. Several schools which had planned to begin the school year August 18 were closed until clean water was available.

A [[Marathon Oil]] refinery in [[Melvindale, Michigan|Melvindale]], near Detroit, suffered a small explosion from gas buildup, necessitating an evacuation within {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} around the plant and the closure of [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]]. Officials feared the release of toxic gases. Heavy rains on August 17 coupled with the lack of sewage pumps closed other expressways and prompted urban flood warnings. Untreated sewage flowed into local rivers in Lansing and Metropolitan Detroit as contingency solutions at some sewage treatment plants failed. In the midst of a summer [[heat wave]], [[Michigander]]s were deprived of [[air conditioning]]. Several people, mostly elderly individuals, had to be treated for symptoms of [[heat stroke]]. In the Detroit area, local television stations' news helicopters were told by each station's management to "stay above the cars' headlights" at night, and to not venture into Downtown Detroit (due to the hazard of flying into an unlit [[skyscraper]]). During the days immediately after the blackout, many stations were back on the air, with limited resources. (In one case, [[WXYZ-TV]]'s news anchor was wearing a T-shirt and shorts, as opposed to his normal news suit, and apologized to viewers for the "rather warm conditions" in the station, as they only had one air conditioner and a couple of fans working.) The [[Downriver]] communities had to contend with basements flooded with sewage-laden water on the weekend immediately after the blackout, with water and sewage pumps off from a lack of power, much to the general annoyance of residents in the areas. News crews of the areas broadcast notices during their coverages of the blackouts to the Downriver residents, explaining why the pumps had shorted out, as well as to limit water usage. ("Most places have water pressure, some have low pressure...some have none, and some even have ''negative pressure''. That means in the next few hours, people in the downriver communities should expect flooded basements from, so move all your valuables high up and out of the basements," as [[WDIV-TV]] warned.) [[West Michigan]], including the communities of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], and [[Holland, Michigan|Holland]] were mostly unaffected, although a large portion was within "seconds" of joining the blackout according to local U.S. Representative [[Fred Upton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dennis|last=Cogswell|title=Area was seconds away from blackout|url=http://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/area-was-seconds-away-from-blackout/article_513f5764-3e16-5ea9-b126-8c953f8ca859.html|newspaper=[[The Herald-Palladium]]|publisher=[[Paxton Media Group]]|date=August 26, 2003|access-date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although right across the border from [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]] was unaffected by the outage, as the two cities are not electrically connected.

====Ohio====
Over 540,000 homes and businesses were without power. In [[Cleveland]], water service stopped because the city is supplied by electric pumps and backup electricity was available only on a very limited basis and water had to be boiled for several days afterwards. Portions of the cities of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Mansfield, Ohio|Mansfield]], [[Massillon, Ohio|Massillon]], [[Marion, Ohio|Marion]], and [[Ashland, Ohio|Ashland]] were without power. Cleveland declared a [[curfew]] on all persons under the age of 18. At [[Cedar Point]] amusement park in [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]], park employees had to help guests walk down the steps of the {{convert|205|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[Magnum XL-200]] roller coaster, which had stopped on the lift hill due to the blackout. Several other guests had to be helped off rides as a result of the blackout. In [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], the [[Toledo Mud Hens|Mud Hens]] baseball team postponed the game scheduled for that night. Some parts of the city were unaffected by the blackout, notably the suburb of [[Sylvania, Ohio|Sylvania]]. Other surrounding cities like [[Bowling Green, Ohio|Bowling Green]] only experienced a brief outage.

====Ontario====

[[File:Jasonp blackout2003 toronto BayAdelaide.jpg|thumb|Volunteers, like Toronto lawyer Peter Carayiannis (pictured), received fluorescent jackets from the police to direct traffic in Toronto during the blackout]]
[[File:Jasonp blackout2003 toronto UnionStnInt.jpg|thumb|Toronto [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] during the blackout]]

The area affected by the blackout included all [[Southern Ontario]], except Pelham, [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] and [[Fort Erie, Ontario|Fort Erie]], from [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] to [[Ottawa]] and all the way to the [[Quebec]] border, except for the [[Cornwall]] area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieso.ca/corporate-ieso/media/also-of-interest/blackout-2003&lt;/ref&gt; Also affected was [[Northern Ontario]], as far north as [[Attawapiskat]] and [[Moosonee]] on [[James Bay]] and west to [[Marathon, Ontario|Marathon]] on the [[Lake Superior]] shoreline. Communities affected in northern Ontario included [[Timmins]], [[Cochrane, Ontario|Cochrane]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Kirkland Lake]], [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]], [[Wawa, Ontario|Wawa]], and [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]. Most of [[Northwestern Ontario]] (including [[Thunder Bay]]) was not affected.

[[Traffic light]]s, which had no backup power, were all knocked out. All intersections were to be considered an [[all-way stop]]. Coupled with the beginning of the evening rush hour, this caused traffic problems. In many major and minor intersections in both large cities, such as Ottawa and Toronto, ordinary citizens began directing traffic until police or others relieved them. Since there were not enough police officers to direct traffic at every intersection during the afternoon rush hour, passing police officers distributed fluorescent jackets to people who were directing traffic. Drivers and pedestrians generally followed the instructions from them even though they were not police officers.&lt;ref name = "CBC archived news clip" /&gt;

In Ottawa, the federal government was shut down. The Parliamentary Precinct, and [[Parliament Hill]] were evacuated.

In Toronto, the [[Toronto subway and RT]] and the [[Toronto streetcar system]], were shut down.&lt;ref name="Rush hour halted in T.O."&gt;{{cite news| title = Outage halts afternoon rush| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2003/08/14/rush_hour030814.html| access-date = August 14, 2013| website= CBC News|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| date = August 14, 2003| author = CBC Staff| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6IsBaUysC?url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2003/08/14/rush_hour030814.html| archive-date = August 14, 2013| location = Toronto| deadurl = no| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many passengers had to be evacuated from subway trains by walking through the tunnels. Major Toronto hospitals reported that they had switched to generators and did not experience problems.&lt;ref name="Hospitals OK in T.O."&gt;{{cite news| title = Massive power failure hits Toronto| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2003/08/14/ont_power20030814.html| access-date = August 14, 2013| website= CBC News|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| date = August 15, 2003| author = CBC Staff| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6IsBzRyef?url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2003/08/14/ont_power20030814.html| archive-date = August 14, 2013| location = Toronto| deadurl = no| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[9-1-1]] system was operational.&lt;ref name="Hospitals OK in T.O."/&gt; The streetcars remained suspended on August 18 and 19, resuming after assurances they would be exempt from any potential rotating blackouts. Toronto officials asked residents to curtail unnecessary use of water, as pumps were not working and there was only a 24-hour supply. Entertainment events were canceled for several days. English band [[Radiohead]] rescheduled a planned August 16 concert in Toronto until the following October 15 due to the power outage. The opening of the [[Canadian National Exhibition]], scheduled for August 15, was postponed to August 19. The roof of the [[Skydome]] in Toronto remained open in an effort to conserve power until August 21, when a thunderstorm struck.

Large disruptions of truck traffic in northeastern Ontario were reported due to the unavailability of fuel, including the backlog near [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]]. The [[Detroit–Windsor Tunnel|tunnel]] and [[Ambassador Bridge|bridge]] between [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and Detroit were also closed, with the bridge's pillars illuminated by emergency [[High-intensity discharge lamp|floodlight]]s, as to not pose a [[shipping]] and [[airplane]] hazard.

About 140 miners were marooned underground in the [[Falconbridge, Ontario|Falconbridge]] mine in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] when the power went out. Mine officials said they were safe and could be evacuated if necessary, but were not, due to the risks of doing so with no power. They were safely evacuated by the morning. In [[Sarnia]], a [[Refining (metallurgy)|refinery]] scrubber lost power and released above-normal levels of pollution; residents were advised to close their windows.

On the evening of August 14, [[Premier of Ontario|Ontario premier]] [[Ernie Eves]] declared a state of emergency, instructing nonessential personnel not to go to work tomorrow and that rolling blackouts could occur for weeks.&lt;ref name="Ontario State of Emergency"&gt;{{cite news| last = Van Rijn| first = Nicholaas| title = BLACKOUT: Eves declares state of emergency and warns of rolling power outages for ‘weeks to come’| newspaper = Toronto Star| date = August 15, 2003| location = Toronto| edition = Special}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents were asked not to use televisions, washing machines, or air conditioners if possible, and warned that some restored power might go off again.&lt;ref name="Ontario State of Emergency"/&gt; Although the full state of emergency was lifted the next day, residents were warned that the normal amount of power would not be available for days, and were still asked to reduce power consumption.&lt;ref name="Ontario State of Emergency"/&gt; 

For two days of this recovery period, diversion of water from the [[Niagara River]] for [[hydroelectric]] generation was increased to the maximum level, normally used only at night and in winter in order to maintain the scenic appearance of [[Niagara Falls]]. The resultant drop in the river level below the falls meant that the [[Maid of the Mist]] tour boats could not dock safely, and their operation had to be suspended.

The [[Petro-Canada]] [[oil refinery|refinery]] in [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] had to perform an emergency shutdown due to the lack of power. The plant's [[gas flare|flare]] system produced large flames during the shutdown, leading to erroneous reports in the media that there had been a fire in the plant.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The Petro Canada lubricants plant in [[Mississauga]] experienced a fire one week later while restarting normal operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Update on Fire and Explosion at Petro-Canada Lubricants Plant in Mississauga, Ontario| url=http://www.petro-canada.ca/en/media/1886.aspx?id=630421| publisher=Petro-Canada|access-date=March 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015182630/http://www.petro-canada.ca/en/media/1886.aspx?id=630421|archive-date=October 15, 2007| date=August 22, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk/docs/cdp_report3.pdf Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Greenhouse Gas Emissions Questionnaire] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725145113/http://www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk/docs/cdp_report3.pdf |date=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergency services==

In New York, about 3,000 fire calls were reported, many from people using candles. Emergency services responded to 80,000 calls for help, more than double the average.

From 4 p.m. of August 14 to midnight of August 15, there were 60 all-hands or greater alarm fires, caused mostly by candles. The FDNY answered over 7,500 calls which resulted in the transmission of over 4,000 alarms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.FDNewYork.com/lightsout.asp |title=Who Turned Out the Lights? |website=Fdnewyork.com |accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatalities===
The blackout contributed to almost 100 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reuters|first1=Staff|title=Spike in deaths blamed on 2003 New York blackout|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackout-newyork/spike-in-deaths-blamed-on-2003-new-york-blackout-idUSTRE80Q07G20120127|accessdate=1 November 2017|agency=Reuters|date=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Ontario]], a cyclist was hit by a car in [[Guelph]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/therecord/access/647946491.html?dids=647946491:647946491&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT |title=The Record.com |newspaper=[[Waterloo Region Record|The Record]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=August 25, 2003 |access-date=April 21, 2010 | first=Cherri | last=Greeno|via=[[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a father of two was hit by a car in his front yard west of [[Ottawa]]. A [[North York, Ontario|North York]] burn victim, a young man injured in an electrical accident in 2001, was found dead in his apartment when his air conditioning unit failed to keep his skin grafts adequately cooled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sootoday.com/content/news/full_story.asp?StoryNumber=4396 |title=Sootoday.com |publisher=Sootoday.com |date=August 17, 2003 | first=David | last=Helwig}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Connecticut]], one death was reported.
* In [[New York City]], six deaths were reported: Two from [[carbon monoxide]], two from fire, one from a fall off a roof while breaking into a shoe store, and one from a heart attack after climbing stairs.
* In the [[Detroit]] suburb of [[Harper Woods, Michigan|Harper Woods]], [[WXYZ-TV]] news reported a man died from [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] after using a [[electrical generator|generator]] in his house.
* In [[Pittsfield Township, Michigan]], a 27-year-old [[Belleville, Michigan|Belleville]] man died in a fire that destroyed the mobile home he was sleeping in, according to ''[[The Ann Arbor News]]''. Officials said the fire was apparently caused by candles left burning.

==Long-term effects==

The blackout prompted the federal government of the United States to include reliability provisions in the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]]. The standards of the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] became mandatory for U.S. electricity providers.

In the United States, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration had emphasized the need for changes to the U.S. national energy policy, [[critical infrastructure protection]], and [[homeland security]]. During the blackout, most systems that would detect unauthorized border crossings, port landings, or detect unauthorized access to many vulnerable sites failed. There was considerable fear that future blackouts would be exploited for [[terrorism]]. In addition, the failure highlighted the ease with which the power grid could be taken down.

The Ontario government fell in a [[Ontario general election, 2003|provincial election]] held in October 2003; power had long been a major issue. The government may have been hurt by the success of [[Quebec]] and [[Manitoba]], which were not affected whereas Ontario was shut down. The extra publicity given to Ontario's need to import electricity from the United States, mostly due to a decision of the government not to expand the province's power generating capabilities, may also have adversely affected the Conservative government. Premier [[Ernie Eves]]'s handling of the crisis was also criticized; he was not heard from until long after Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Pataki had spoken out. Due to the regular announcements he gave in the days following the blackout, Eves enjoyed a moderate increase in the polls that his party took as a sign of an opportunity to call an [[Ontario general election, 2003|election]] they could win, but they lost instead.

==Restoration of service==
By evening of August 14, power had been restored to:

*Many areas of [[Ontario]]
*Parts of [[New Jersey]]
*Parts of [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]] and [[Michigan]]
*Parts of [[New York (state)|New York]], including [[Long Island]]

[[Con Edison]] retracted its claim that New York City would have power by 1 a.m. That night some areas of Manhattan regained power at approximately 5 a.m. (August 15), the New York City borough of [[Staten Island]] regained power around 3 a.m. on August 15, and Niagara Mohawk predicted that the [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] area would have to wait until 8 a.m. In the New York City borough of Brooklyn power was not fully restored until around sunset on August 15.

By early evening of August 15, two airports, [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] and [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], were back in service.

Half of the affected part of Ontario had power by the morning of August 15, though even in areas where it had come back online, some services were still disrupted or running at lower levels. The last areas to regain power were usually suffering from trouble at local electrical substations that was not directly related to the blackout itself.

By August 16, power was fully restored in New York and Toronto. Toronto's subway and streetcars remained out of service until August 18 to prevent the possibility of equipment being stuck in awkward locations if the power was interrupted again. Power had been mostly restored in Ottawa, though authorities warned of possible additional disruptions and advised conservation as power continued to be restored to other areas. Ontarians were asked to reduce their electricity use by 50% until all generating stations could be brought back on line. Four remained out of service on the 19th. Illuminated billboards were largely dormant for the week following the blackout, and many stores had only a portion of their lights on.

Preparations against the possible disruptions threatened by the [[Year 2000 problem]] have been credited for the installation of new electrical equipment and systems which allowed for a relatively rapid restoration of power in some areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Media coverage and official reports==
In the United States and Canada, the regional blackout dominated news broadcasts and news headlines beginning August 15. U.S. and Canadian television networks pre-empted normal programming in favor of full-time, advertising-free coverage of the unfolding story. Once terrorism had been conclusively ruled out as a cause, many stations switched back to normal programming following an 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT address by President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/aug2003/2003-08-15-03.html |title=Blackout 2003: Bush Rules Out Terrorism, Pledges Grid Review |publisher=Newswire |date=August 15, 2003 |access-date=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; National news stations, such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and [[CNN]], continued to cover the story by inviting politicians and electrical experts to discuss the situation and suggest ways to prevent blackouts. Internationally, coverage of the story focused on the development of the situation in the [[New York City]] metropolitan area.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Statements made in the aftermath===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2007}}
During the first two hours of the event, various officials offered speculative explanations as to its root cause:
*Official reports from the office of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]] stated that [[lightning]] had struck a power plant in northern New York, resulting in a [[cascading failure]] of the surrounding power grid and wide-area [[electric power transmission]] grid, resulted in the outage. (A lightning strike to a power substation north of New York City was similarly blamed for the [[1977 New York City blackout|1977 blackout]] that plunged nearly the entire city into darkness for 24 hours.) New York state power officials replied that the problem did not originate in the United States, there was no rain storm in the area where the lightning allegedly stuck, and the power plant in question remained in operation throughout the blackout.
*Canadian Defence Minister [[John McCallum]] blamed an outage at a [[nuclear power|nuclear plant]] in [[Pennsylvania]], where state officials reported all plants were functioning normally. McCallum later said his sources had given him incorrect information.
*[[New York (state)|New York]] governor [[George Pataki]] blamed the power outage on Canada, stating, "the New York independent systems operator says they are virtually certain it had nothing to do in New York state. And they believe it occurred west of [[Ontario]], cascaded from there into Ontario, [[Canada]], and through the Northeast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1402915,00.html |title=Canada gets blackout blame: World: News |publisher=News24 |date=August 15, 2003 |access-date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later proven to be false.
*CNN cited unnamed officials as saying that the [[Niagara-Mohawk power grid]], which provides power for large portions of New York and parts of Canada, was overloaded. Between 4:10 and 4:13&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT, 21 power stations throughout that grid shut down.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;
*[[New Mexico]] governor [[Bill Richardson]], who formerly headed the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], in a live television interview two hours into the blackout characterized the United States as "a superpower with a third-world electricity grid." In Europe, this statement was published accompanied with comparisons highlighting the tighter, safer and better interconnected European electricity network (though Italy would suffer a [[2003 Italy blackout|similar blackout]] six weeks later).
*In the ensuing days, critics focused on the role of [[electricity market]] [[deregulation]] for the inadequate state of the [[electric power transmission]] grid, claiming that deregulation laws and electricity market mechanisms had failed to provide market participants with sufficient incentives to construct new transmission lines and maintain system security.{{Who|date=June 2010}}
*Later that night, claims surfaced that the blackout may have started in Ohio up to one hour before the network shut down, a claim denied by Ohio's [[FirstEnergy]] utility.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
*The president of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation said that the problem originated in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Statement of Michehl R. Gent, President and CEO| url=http://www.nerc.com/pub_doc/media-statement-08-16-03.doc| publisher=North American Electric Reliability Council| access-date=March 31, 2012| author=Michehl R.

*By the morning of August 18, investigators believed that the problem began with a sudden shift in the direction of power flow on the northern portion of the [[Lake Erie Transmission Loop]], a system of transmission lines that circles [[Lake Erie]] on both U.S. and Canadian soil.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Voluntary Blackout Day commemorations==
In Ontario, some cities took part in power conservation challenges or events to remind citizens of the blackout, the most well-known event being the Voluntary Blackout Day hosted by the Ontario Power Authority. During these events, citizens were encouraged to maximize their [[energy conservation]] activities. Smaller cities such as London, Guelph, [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] took part in the challenges annually. The final Voluntary Blackout Day was held on August 14, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.woodstocksentinelreview.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3231415 |title=Blackout Day fades to black |publisher=woodstocksentinelreview.com |date=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nushawn Williams''' (born November 1, 1976), also known as '''Shyteek Johnson''', is an [[United States|American]] convicted [[sex offender]] who admitted in 1997 to having [[unprotected sex]] with numerous girls and women after having been told that he was [[HIV]] positive. New York state and local public health officials stated that Williams had sex with up to 47 women in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]] and at least 28 more in [[New York City]]. Williams, who has boasted openly in the media about his sexual promiscuity, said in a news interview that his actual number of sexual partners was up to 300.&lt;ref name="NYT072999"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Cooper |title=Drifter Says He Had Sex With Up to 300 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/29/nyregion/drifter-says-he-had-sex-with-up-to-300.html |work=[[The New York Times]]  |date=July 29, 1999 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case history==
Williams, a native of [[Brooklyn]], led a life of crime since his childhood.&lt;ref name="NYT103097"&gt;{{cite news |first = Joe |last = Sexton |authorlink = Joseph Sexton |title = After Childhood of Violence, A One-Man H.I.V.

He used several aliases, including the name Shyteek Johnson, under which he was jailed for a drug offense before he faced the HIV transmission charges.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=Officials Link Man to 11 Teen-Agers With H.I.V.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/28/nyregion/officials-link-man-to-11-teen-agers-with-hiv.html|accessdate=June 26,  2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 28, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Numerous reports indicate that Williams was a crack dealer who bragged of his gang-related activities and had a history of violence against women, including many of the women he infected.&lt;ref name="TWP"&gt;{{cite news |first = Jennifer |last = Frey |title = Jamestown and the Story of 'Nushawn's Girls' |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/jamestown0601.htm |work = [[The Washington Post]] |date = June 1, 1999 |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite news |first = Jennifer |last = Tanaka |author2=Gregory Beals  |title = The Victims' Stories: He Charmed The Lost And The Unwanted |url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/97360 |work = [[Newsweek]] |date = November 10, 1997 |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams' [[wikt:braggadocio|braggadocio]] and violence belied the ease with which he attracted women of all races and socioeconomic classes,&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; though most of his victims were those with socioeconomic or emotional problems. News reports make numerous mentions of his charming interpersonal style with women. Women quoted in news stories often pointed to Williams' ability to make them feel special and loved, even while exercising violent control over their actions. In the case of his youngest victim, who was 13, Williams reportedly pursued a relationship for several months.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt;

Williams stated that he believed health officials had lied to him when they informed him of his HIV status.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; He was the primary cause of an HIV micro-epidemic in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]]. He infected at least 14 women in Chautauqua County with HIV, including numerous teenagers. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to two counts of [[statutory rape]] (two of his victims were underage) and one count of reckless endangerment in the first degree for having unprotected sex with a woman who did not know his HIV status.  He received a four-to-12-year sentence. Two of Williams' children in Chautauqua County were born with HIV, raising the number of known cases linked to Williams to 16.&lt;ref name="NYT012998"&gt;{{cite news |first = Richard |last = Perez-Pena |title = Two Births Lengthen List In One-Man H.I.V. Spree |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/29/nyregion/two-births-lengthen-list-in-one-man-hiv-spree.html |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = January 29, 1998 |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 10 of Williams's sexual partners in New York City have been found to be HIV-positive, though it is unclear if Williams is the source of these infections.&lt;ref name="NYT012998"/&gt;

==Case impact==
His case received widespread media attention and ignited a debate over whether knowingly spreading HIV could be viewed as a crime as well as debates over the promiscuous sexuality of U.S. culture and the role of [[Sex education in the United States|sex education in American high schools]]. Many stated that the maximum sentence Williams could receive was unduly light, leading then-New York City mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] to call for Williams to be tried for "attempted murder, or worse."&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;{{Cite news|title=Trail of Arrests, H.I.V. Fears And a Woman's Tale of Love |first=Jane |last=Gross |date=October 29, 1997 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/29/nyregion/trail-of-arrests-hiv-fears-and-a-woman-s-tale-of-love.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case also raised questions as to whether the state should continue to respect the anonymity of those who test positive for HIV. Prior to the Williams case, health officials believed that publicizing the names of HIV-positive individuals would result in a reduction in HIV testing and subject HIV-positive individuals, particularly members of the gay community, to increased social stigma. As a result of the Williams case, New York passed a law that mandated doctors and laboratories to report the names of individuals who test positive for HIV. Reporting of partners to physicians is voluntary, but doctors are mandated to report that the names of any known partners to the NYS Department of Health. Partners may be notified without the permission of the patient, but must be informed that their partners will be notified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/consumers/hiv_basics/100_questions/publichealthlaw.htm |title=Public Health Law Relating to HIV Reporting and Partner Notification |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=October 2013 |website=NYS Department of Health |publisher= |access-date=March 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404061742/https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/consumers/hiv_basics/100_questions/publichealthlaw.htm|archive-date=April 4, 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 developments==
In April 2010, New York attorney general [[Andrew Cuomo]] moved to block Williams' release from prison after 12 years and place him under [[civil confinement]] under a statute aimed at predatory sex offenders. A judge ordered him remanded to custody pending an outcome of a civil proceeding.&lt;ref name="NYT041310"&gt;{{cite news |first=Danny |last=Hakim |title=Man Who Spread HIV May Be Held |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/nyregion/14nushawn.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pacific Western Airlines Flight 501''' was a regularly scheduled flight from [[Calgary]] to [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. The aircraft caught fire during takeoff on March 22, 1984. All 119 passengers and crew members survived, but five people suffered serious injuries while 22 others suffered minor injuries.

==Accident description==
The [[Boeing 737]], registered C-GQPW, taxied from the gate at [[Calgary International Airport]] at 7:35 AM and proceeded to take off on runway 34, carrying five crew members and 114 passengers.  At 7:42 AM, a loud popping sound was heard 20 seconds into the takeoff run.  The aircraft began to vibrate and veer to the left, and a fire broke out in the rear of the aircraft.  The pilot, Stan Fleming, managed to abort the take-off.

An emergency evacuation was ordered as the fire spread throughout the aircraft.  Five people were seriously injured and 22 suffered minor injuries, but no one was killed.  The aircraft was destroyed by the fire.

The Canadian Aviation Safety Board (CASB) determined that an uncontained failure of the left engine thirteenth stage compressor disc had occurred. Debris from the engine punctured a fuel cell, resulting in the fire. The disc failure was the result of fatigue cracking. The fire was attributed to a faulty [[Jet engine compressors|compressor]] disc that blew apart, rupturing the fuel tanks. This incident was similar to the cause of the [[British Airtours Flight 28M]] disaster that claimed 55 lives in 1985.

&lt;/ref&gt; The customs observed on Plough Monday varied by region, but a common feature to a lesser or greater extent was for a [[plough]] to be hauled from house to house in a procession, collecting money. They were often accompanied by musicians, an old woman or a boy dressed as an old woman, called the "Bessy," and a man in the role of the "[[Clown|fool]]." 'Plough Pudding' is a boiled suet pudding, containing meat and onions. It is from Norfolk and is eaten on Plough Monday.&lt;ref name="hone" /&gt;

William Hone made use of ''Observations on the Popular Antiquities of Great Britain: Including the Whole of Mr. Bourne's Antiquitates Vulgares'' (1777) by the antiquary [[John Brand (antiquarian)|John Brand]]. Brand's work (with additions by [[Henry Ellis (librarian)|Henry Ellis]]) mentions a northern English Plough Monday custom also observed in the beginning of [[Lent]]. Evidently the Plough dance depicted by [[Phiz]] in his illustrations for [[Harrison Ainsworth]]'s 1858 novel ''Mervyn Clitheroe'', and Ainsworth's description, is based on this or a similar account:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hone's Every-Day Book |url= http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Text/Hone/plough_monday.htm}} The material is omitted from the ''Plough Monday'' entry in the Revised edition of Brand of 1905.

{{cquote|The FOOL PLOUGH goes about: a pageant consisting of a number of ''sword dancers dragging a plough,'' with music; one, sometimes two, in very strange attire; the Bessy, in the grotesque habit of an old woman, and the Fool, almost covered with skins, a hairy cap on, and the tail of some animal hanging from his back. The office of one of these characters, in which he is very assiduous, is to go about rattling a box amongst the spectators of the dance, in which he receives their little donations.&lt;ref&gt;John Brand, ''Observations on Popular Antiquities'' (1777). Loc. in new edition with the additions of Sir Henry Ellis (Chatto and Windus, London 1900), p. 273-274.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
In the [[Isles of Scilly]], locals would [[crossdressing|cross-dress]] and then visit their neighbours to joke about local occurrences. There would be [[guise dancing]] ([[Folk etymology|folk-etymologically]] rendered as "goose dancing" by either the authors or those whom they observed) and considerable drinking and revelry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6-E8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=%22plough+monday%22+%22islands+of+scilly%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ktt1o5xITF&amp;sig=h6rq5YISM06ZaIjmCKnOj5keNaE&amp;hl=en "Plough Monday"], ''The Every-day Book and Table Book; or, Everlasting Calendar of Popular Amusements, Sports, Pastimes, Ceremonies, Manners, Customs, and Events, Each of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Days, in Past and Present Times; Forming a Complete History of the Year, Months, and Seasons, and a Perpetual Key to the Almanac, Including Accounts of the Weather, Rules for Health and Conduct, Remarkable and Important Anecdotes, Facts, and Notices, in Chronology, Antiquities, Topography, Biography, Natural History, Art, Science, and General Literature; Derived from the Most Authentic Sources, and Valuable Original Communication, with Poetical Elucidations, for Daily Use and Diversion.

In certain regions of Belgium, the Monday after the Epiphany is called ''Verloren Maandag'' (literally ''lost Monday'', indicating a day with no work and hence no pay) with typical food associated.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Verloren maandag]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|certain=yes|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2017}}

==History==
On October 25, 1988, American President [[Ronald Reagan]] proclaimed the month of October 1988, Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month.&lt;ref name="reagan"/&gt;

October 15 Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day Campaign began in 2002 as an American movement started by Robyn Bear, Lisa Brown, and Tammy Novak. Together, they petitioned the federal government, as well as the governors of each of the 50 states, in conjunction with the first observation of Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day in October 15, 2002, 20 states signed proclamations recognizing the date as such. As a result of the American campaign effort, Concurrent Resolution 222, Supporting the goals and ideals of National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day was passed in the House of Representatives on September 28, 2006.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

As of 2016, all 50 American states have yearly proclamations, with Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, Rhode Island, and South Dakota adopting permanent proclamations.

PAiL Awareness Campaign, Founder &amp; International Ambassador, Terra-Lynn Coggan, founder of Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day Canada, initiated her Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness &amp; Remembrance Campaign in September 2003, following the stillbirth of her nephew Riley Joseph who she was to adopt and began lobbying the provincial government for formalized observation of Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness and Remembrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphjournal.com/greater-saint-john/story/100764450/stillborn-lights-of-love-holidays-remembrance|title=For the Love of Riley - A Legacy of Love|last=|first=|date=2003-09-26|editor-last=Coggan|editor-first=Terra-Lynn|website=TLCPAiL|publisher=PAiL Awareness Campaign|location=Canada|archive-url=http://www.facebook.com/September.26th.2003|archive-date=2018-11-13|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September of 2004, Ms. Coggan, subsequent to solicitation by American Pregnancy and Infant Remembrance Day Campaign director, joined the American movement and acquired the role as the Canadian Director for October 15 Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. Succeeding New Brunswick's official recognition of October 15, Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day, October 12, 2005, Coggan, citing irreconcilable difference, resigned as the Canadian Director for the American Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day Campaign and independently launched the PAiL Awareness Campaign &amp; Initiatives.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/TLCPAiL|title=Riley's Legacy|last=|first=|date=2018-11-13|year=2018|website=TLCPAiL|publisher=PAiL Awareness Campaign|location=Canada|archive-url=https://www.telegraphjournal.com/greater-saint-john/story/100764450/stillborn-lights-of-love-holidays-remembrance|archive-date=2018-11-15|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following New Brunswick’s Declaration in observation of Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day others have followed Mrs Coggan's lead and introduced similar legislation at the municipal, state, provincial and national level of government in acknowledgement and recognition of October 15.

==International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day==

International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day is not officially legislated or observed. However, despite the lack of formality, individuals, families and organizations from across the world and around the globe, come together each year on October 15 in observation of the day and in promotion of greater public awareness, in remembrance of the babies who die too soon and support for bereaved baby loss families. Through the legislative campaigns and initiatives of individuals and organizations worldwide, more countries are joining the effort to officially observe October 15, Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day.

===American federal campaign===
As a result of the American campaign effort, Concurrent Resolution 222, supporting the goals and ideals of National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day, was passed in the House of Representatives on September 28, 2006. House Concurrent Resolution 222 proclaims October 15 of each year to be Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day in the United States.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

===Australia===

In May 2008, Nicole Ballinger of the State of New South Wales(NSW) contacted her State and Federal MPs asking for help in creating an official Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day in Australia. She wanted it nationally declared but started at the state level in hopes that if it was passed on the state level, it would be easier to get it passed at the federal level. Joanna Gash and Shelley Hancock, MPs at the Federal and State level, respectively, helped Ballinger lobby at both levels. 

In NSW, Hancock and NSW Health Minister Jillian Skinner announced that Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day had been officially declared.

Ballinger and Gash are still working to get Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day declared nationwide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The campaign for recognition of Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day in Western Australia began in 2012 by John and Kate De'Laney. However it was a letter that Mrs De'Laney penned, in September 2013, to Premier Colin Barnett which brought Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day to his attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembrance day for lost babies|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/25269100/remembrance-day-for-lost-babies/|website=The West}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2014, the Western Australian State Government passed a bipartisan agreement to officially recognize Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. In the motion put before the Legislative Council Premier Colin Barnett said "Through this remembrance day we hope to create a greater awareness in the community about the immeasurable impact that pregnancy and early infancy loss has on so many women, their partners and families within our community. We hope that through the recognition of their loss and the subsequent pain endured, this remembrance day can play a small part in enabling families to find a way forward in their grieving, and in time heal the deep wound of loss. Most importantly, this remembrance day acknowledges that these babies were lovingly anticipated and remain forever in their parents’ hearts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Barnett CJ | title = Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day |work=Parliamentary Debates |url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/Hansard/hansard.nsf/0/929B9F5E0FBB63E848257D74002CF64B/$File/A39%20S1%2020141015%20All.pdf| publisher = Western Australian State Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===

The first celebration of Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day in Italy took place in 2007 by initiative of CiaoLapo Onlus charity for perinatal loss support. Since then, several local celebrations, as well as national meetings, are held every year on October 15 in many Italian towns. Through the lobbying efforts of CiaoLapo Onlus, on November 26, 2013 a press conference for the presentation of a bill for the official recognition of the day by the Italian state took place in Rome at the Chamber of Deputies, which was attended by politicians Aldo Di Biagio (Senate) and Matteo Biffoni (House) together with Claudia Ravaldi and Alfredo Vannacci of CiaoLapo, promoters of this initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Proposta di legge » Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness|url = http://www.babyloss.info/proposta-di-legge/|website = www.babyloss.info|access-date = 2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quadrille Ball''' is an annual [[Ball (dance)|society ball]] that has taken place in [[New York City]] each year since 1961, usually in January or February. It is a non-profit event that benefits the [[German studies|Germanistic]] Society, which in turn awards scholarships for German graduate students. The event is normally held at the [[Plaza Hotel]] in [[Manhattan]]. In 2006, due to the Plaza being closed for renovations, the ball was held at the Pierre Hotel instead.

The main performance at the ball is the [[Quadrille]] dance, hence the name of the ball. The Quadrille dance is performed each year by a new batch of [[debutante]]s (female and male, generally ages 21–30) who are paired up as couples. Most years there are 20 couples, but this number can vary slightly from year to year, although the total number of couples in the performance must be divisible by the number four, since the root word "quad" refers to the number four, and couples are arranged in squares of four couples each, as in American square dancing. Each couple is announced as they are first presented and make their way onto the ballroom floor. There is also a Caller who keeps announcing what steps are to be done next, throughout the dance. The tempo of the Quadrille dance is slow and stately, which lends an elegant and aristocratic air to the performance. The steps date back to the 17th century, when they were done by nobility in the royal courts of [[Europe]]. Since the Quadrille Ball always presents the same exact dance steps each year, the debutantes from previous years (called alumni) simply pass down the steps to the new debutantes, so therefore the ball does not need a choreographer to create new steps each year. After the Quadrille dance presentation, any [[Alumnus|alumni]] present are invited up for an honorary alumni waltz (improvisational), and then there is social dancing the rest of the night to a live orchestra that plays ballroom dance music ([[waltz]], [[Tango (dance)|tango]], [[foxtrot]], [[Swing (dance)|swing]], Latin, etc.).

Debutantes are only supposed to perform once, and then they become alumni and have the option of applying to join the Junior Committee, which helps to train the next year's debutantes. Weekly rehearsals, which are organized by the Junior Committee, take place during the three months leading up to the ball (November, December, and January). After-parties are arranged following each [[rehearsal]], in order to encourage camaraderie and social interaction among participants, and often are held at the private residences of alumni. New debutantes are usually referred by alumni, but the ball also considers applications from people who have no prior connection to the ball.

One interesting thing about this ball is that even though it is a [[Germans|German]] organized ball, the Caller announces the steps entirely in [[French language|French]]. This can be explained by the fact that French used to be the universal language of European courts centuries ago when the Quadrille dance was invented, and therefore the steps are codified in the French language.

During the 57th Quadrille Ball, on January 28th, 2017, [[Charlie O'Loughlin]] participated as a dancer and danced with Debbie Chiang&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quadrilleball.org/dancers/ |title=Quadrille Dancers}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was featured in the [[New York Times]] at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2017/02/03/fashion/parties-chinese-new-year-american-songbook-gala-new-york-philharmonic/s/05SCENE-CITY-slide-8YHC.html |title=After dinner, the Cotillion Room was turned into the Kuka Night Club for late-night dancing |publisher=New York Times |date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''racket''' is an organized criminal act, usually in which the criminal act is a form of [[business]] or a way to earn illegal money regularly or briefly but repeatedly. A racket is often a repeated or continuous criminal operation.  
Originally and often still specifically, a racket was a criminal act in which the [[perpetrator]] or perpetrators offer a service that is [[fraud|fraudulently]] offered to solve a nonexistent problem, a service that will not be put into effect, or a service that would not exist without the racket. Conducting a racket is '''racketeering'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racketeering|title= Racketeering|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it, but that fact may be concealed, with the specific intent to engender continual [[patronage]] for this party.

The most common example of a racket is the "[[protection racket]]", which promises to protect the target business or person from dangerous individuals in the neighborhood and then either collects the money or causes damage to the business until the owner pays. The racket exists as both the problem and its solution, and it is used as a method of [[extortion]].

However, the term "racket" has expanded in definition and may be used less strictly to refer to any illegal [[organized crime]] operation, including those that do not necessarily involve fraudulent practices. For example, "racket" may be used to refer to the "[[numbers racket]]" or the "[[illegal drug trade|drug racket]]", neither of which generally or explicitly involve fraud or [[deception]] with regard to the intended [[clientele]]. 

Racketeering is most often associated with [[organized crime]], and the term was coined by the [[Employers' Association of Greater Chicago|Employers' Association of Chicago]] in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] union.&lt;ref&gt;David Witwer, "'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s", in ''Corrupt Histories'', Emmanuel Kreike and William Chester Jordan, eds., University of Rochester Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58046-173-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Examples of crimes that may be alleged to be part of a pattern of racketeering activity include

*A [[protection racket]] is a form of [[extortion]] whereby racketeers offer to "protect" property from damage in exchange for a fee, while also being responsible, in part or in whole, for the property damage.
*A [[Fence (criminal)|fencing racket]] is an operation specializing in the resale of stolen goods.
*A [[Numbers game|numbers racket]] is any unauthorized [[lottery]] or illegal gambling operation.
*[[Money laundering]] and other [[creative accounting]] practices that are misused in ways to disguise sources of illegal funds.
*[[Theft]] operations, including: [[burglary]], [[home invasion]], [[robbery]], [[identity theft]], [[auto theft]], [[art theft]], [[Carjacking|car hijacking]], [[truck hijacking]], [[organized retail crime]], [[shoplifting]], and [[copyright infringement]] (including the sale of [[counterfeit]] goods)
*[[Fraud]] and [[embezzlement]] operations, including: [[credit card fraud]], [[check fraud]], [[health care fraud]], [[insurance fraud]], [[mail and wire fraud]], [[securities fraud]], [[bank fraud]], [[mortgage fraud]], [[skimming (fraud)]], [[electoral fraud]], [[confidence tricks]], and [[bid rigging]]
*[[Kidnapping]]
*[[Murder]] and [[murder-for-hire]]
*[[Bribery]] and [[police corruption]]
*Organized [[academic dishonesty]] by school administrators, as in the [[Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal]]

* Criminal operation of otherwise ostensibly legal operations, such as [[strip club]]s, [[casino]]s, and [[waste management]] firms
* [[Poaching]], [[overfishing]], [[illegal logging]], [[illegal construction]], and [[illegal mining]]
*[[Dog fighting]], [[cockfighting]], and [[bullfighting]]

==RICO Act==
{{Main|Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act}}
On October 15, 1970, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ([[18 U.S.C.]] §§ 1961–1968), commonly referred to as the "RICO Act", became [[United States]] law. The RICO Act allowed law enforcement to charge a person or group of people with racketeering, defined as committing multiple violations of certain varieties within a ten-year period. The purpose of the RICO Act was stated as "the elimination of the infiltration of organized crime and racketeering into legitimate organizations operating in [[interstate commerce]]". S.Rep. No. 617, [[91st United States Congress|91st Cong.]], 1st Sess. 76 (1968). However, the statute is sufficiently broad to encompass [[crime|illegal activities]] relating to any enterprise affecting interstate or foreign [[commerce]].

Section 1961(10) of Title 18 provides that the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General of the United States]] may designate any department or agency to conduct investigations authorized by the RICO statute and such department or agency may use the investigative provisions of the statute or the investigative power of such department or agency otherwise conferred by law. Absent a specific designation by the Attorney General, jurisdiction to conduct investigations for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962 lies with the agency having jurisdiction over the violations constituting the pattern of racketeering activity listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/110mcrm.htm#9-110.010 |title=Organized Crime and Racketeering |publisher=Usdoj.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, civil racketeering laws are also used in federal and [[State court (United States)|state courts]].

{{multiple image|image1=General Electric "Monitor-Top" refrigerator at Chaim Weizmann mansion.jpg|image2=Nada.jpg|footer=An older refrigerator with a closing latch and a newer version which closes magnetically}}
A '''refrigerator death''' is death by [[suffocation]] in a [[refrigerator]] or similar appliance such as a [[freezer]]. Because, by design, such appliances are air-tight when closed, a person trapped inside will have a limited supply of oxygen. Early refrigerators could only be opened from the outside making accidental trappings, a possibility particularly of children playing with discarded appliances; several such deaths have been recorded.&lt;ref name=PHR&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=1424727 | pmid=3920722 | volume=100 | title=Effectiveness of measures to prevent unintentional deaths of infants and children from suffocation and strangulation | year=1985 | journal=Public Health Rep | pages=231–40 | last1 = Kraus | first1 = JF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spitz-1993&gt;{{cite book | title = Spitz and Fisher's Medicolegal Investigation of Death: Guidelines for the Application of Pathology to Crime Investigation | year = 1993 | page = 486 | editor-first = Werner U. | editor-last = Spitz | edition = Third | publisher = Charles C Thomas Publisher Ltd. | location = Springfield, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern designs close with a [[magnetic]] mechanism that can be opened from the inside, reducing the danger of accidental trappings.

==United States==
Children would occasionally play in abandoned appliances, such as refrigerators and washing machines, and become trapped.&lt;ref name=Spitz-1993 /&gt; Deaths were not uncommon for children in the United States before the passage of the [[Refrigerator Safety Act]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=StraightDope&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2586/is-it-impossible-to-open-a-refrigerator-door-from-the-inside | work = The Straight Dope | title = Is it impossible to open a refrigerator door from the inside? | first = Cecil | last = Adams | author-link = Cecil Adams | date = March 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.herald-mail.com/2011-02-15/news/28538457_1_neil-c-parrott-household-refrigerators-violators | title = Parrott proposes change to refrigerator law | work = Herald-Mail | date = February 15, 2011 | first = Andrew | last = Schotz | location = Annapolis, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fridgefreezersite.com/a-refrigerator-can-kill-you/ | title = How A Refrigerator Can Kill You | work = The Refrigerator and Fridge Freezer Site | author = Steve | date = March 17, 2011 | publisher = Fridge Freezer Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first reactions to the deaths were to ask people not to abandon refrigerators and to detach the doors of unused refrigerators. At least one state, Oklahoma, enacted legislation making the abandonment of a refrigerator with a latch in a location where a child might find it a felony.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=21 O.S. § 1208: Title 21. Crimes and Punishments, Chapter 48 - Miscellaneous and General Provisions, Section 1208 - Abandonment of Refrigerator or Icebox in Place Accessible to Children a Misdemeanor |url=http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/deliverdocument.asp?id=69664&amp;hits=450+262+183+154+15+| work = Oklahoma Statutes | publisher = Oklahoma State Courts | date = June 2, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least as early as 1954, alternative methods of securing air-tight closures had been suggested, such as in patent 2767011, filed by Francis P. Buckley ''et al.'' in 1954 and issued in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT2767011&amp;id=RGBVAAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=refrigerator+deaths+&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q=magnet&amp;f=false | title = Patent US2767011 A: REFRIGERATOR LATCH MECHANISM | date = October 16, 1956 | first = Francis P. | last = Buckley | publisher = [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|United States Patent Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid- to late 1950s troops of people would sometimes search out abandoned refrigerators, detaching the doors and smashing the locks. However, these efforts were not entirely effective, and children were still dying inside refrigerators that had not been found and dismantled. 

The continued occurrence of refrigerator deaths led to a law that required a change in the way refrigerator doors stay shut. The Refrigerator Safety Act is codified at 15 U.S.C. 1211-1214 as Public Law 84-930, 70 Stat. 953, on August 2, 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/pdfs/blk_pdf_rsa.pdf | format = PDF | title = REFRIGERATOR SAFETY ACT (Codified at 15 U.S.C. 1211−1214) (Public Law 84-930, 70 Stat. 953, August 2, 1956) | date = August 2, 1956 | work = [[United States Code]] | publisher = [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|United States Consumer Product Safety Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act applied to all refrigerators manufactured in the United States after October 31, 1958, and is largely responsible for the adoption of the [[magnetic]] mechanism that is used today instead of a latch.&lt;ref name=StraightDope /&gt;  Individual American states also have similar laws, such as [[California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/402b.html | title = California Penal Code Section 402b | date = September 9, 2016 | work = [[California Penal Code]] | publisher = State of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.03.010 | title = RCW 9.03.010: Abandoning, discarding refrigeration equipment | publisher = [[Washington State Legislature]] | date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of deaths due to suffocation in refrigerators declined a significant amount in the years after the law.&lt;ref name=PHR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://depts.washington.edu/hiprc/practices/topic/suffocation/legislation.html | title = Choking, Aspiration, and Suffocation Interventions | work = Best Practices | publisher = Harborview Injury Prevention &amp; Research Center, [[University of Washington School of Social Work]] | dead-url = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040509204727/http://depts.washington.edu/hiprc/practices/topic/suffocation/legislation.html | archive-date = May 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elsewhere==
Around the world, manufacture of latch refrigerators has been replaced by  that of ones with magnet-closing doors.

As recently as 2013, deaths in a latched refrigerator occurred, in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/14/children-die-in-refrigerator_n_3926649.html|title=3 Children Die From Suffocation After Getting Stuck In Refrigerator In South Africa|first=Agence France|last=Presse|date=September 14, 2013|publisher=|access-date=January 1, 2018|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural Impact==
In an early draft of ''[[Back to the Future]]'', the time machine was a refrigerator. This idea was eventually scrapped, partly because the writers wanted the time machine to be mobile, and because [[Robert Zemeckis]] was afraid that kids would imitate the film and get trapped in refrigerators.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-cronin/did-marty-mcfly-originall_b_8293916.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Davenant.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Davenant]], owner of Rutland House, Aldersgate Street.]]

'''Rutland House''' was the name of at least two [[London]] houses occupied by the  [[Duke of Rutland|Earls]] and [[Dukes of Rutland]].
Rutland House on Aldersgate Street was leased by playwright Sir [[William Davenant]], who converted a room of it into a private theatre in the 1650s. Rutland House in Knightsbridge was a six-acre site until its demolition in the 1830s.

==Rutland House, Aldersgate Street==
Rutland House on [[Aldersgate|Aldersgate Street]], near [[Charterhouse Square]] in the [[City of London]], close to [[Smithfield Market]], was leased by the playwright and impresario Sir [[William Davenant]] (1606–1668).

In 1656, freshly released from imprisonment, Davenant turned a room of the house into what was, at first, a private [[theatre]] performing his own [[Play (theatre)|plays]]. Soon the performances were advertised and semi-open to the public at a cost of 5 [[shilling]]s a head, a figure that ensured that only persons of quality would be able to attend. The reason for Rutland House being used rather than a conventional theatre was to overcome the laws of [[censorship]] which operated in all public places following the closures of all public theatres by the [[Puritan]] government of [[Oliver Cromwell]].

The house seems to have been not totally suitable for theatrical use; however, a low narrow hall, or [[salon (room)|salon]], at the rear of the house was adapted for the performances. Rather than sitting in comfort, the audience had to sit on improvised [[Bench (furniture)|bench]]es, and so confined was the space available that the benches had to be arranged at an angle to the small [[stage (theatre)|stage]] to accommodate the large audiences who came.  The small stage, described by Davenant as a  "Cup-board stage", was adorned with gold and purple curtains.  Above the stage in what was contemporarily described as a "louver hole" was concealed a small [[orchestra]].

Davenant had seen Italian [[opera]] sung in [[Paris]]; this inspired him to conceive a cunning plan: as the Puritan government had no objection to music, only drama, he obtained permission to stage a performance of his opera  ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]'', to be sung in "[[recitative]] music".  Thus, the first English opera was performed at Rutland House in May 1656 &lt;!--https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/4/3/8/14380/14380-8.txt says 23 May, http://www.hoasm.org/VIIA/Davenant.html says 21 May--&gt;, simultaneously overcoming the prohibition of drama.  The Rutland House production also included [[England]]'s first professional [[actress]], Mrs. Coleman &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/4/1/2/4126/4126.txt&lt;/ref&gt; and was later transferred to the [[Cockpit Theatre]] in [[Drury Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/4/3/8/14380/14380-8.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

Davenant established at least two other "private performance houses" in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] and [[Drury Lane]]. After Davenant opened more conventional theatres, he continued to use Rutland House to preview new productions, to gauge audience reaction.

==Rutland House, Knightsbridge==
[[File:Rutland House Knightsbridge London.png|thumb|right|230px|Rutland House, [[Knightsbridge]]]]
Another Rutland House occupied a six-acre site in [[Knightsbridge]], then just outside London, from the mid 18th century until it was demolished in 1836. Rutland Gate, a street-cum-square of well-proportioned houses was erected on its site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZMEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22levett+blackborne%22&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;q=thoroton#PPA54-IA2,M1 Some Account of the Military, Political and Social Life of the Right Hon.

'''Salting the earth''', or '''sowing with salt''', is the ritual of spreading [[Sodium chloride|salt]] on conquered cities to symbolize a curse on their re-inhabitation.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, 1986, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gevritz"&gt;Gevirtz, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; It originated as a symbolic practice in the ancient [[Near East]] and became a well-established [[folkloric]] motif in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destroying cities==
The custom of purifying or consecrating a destroyed city with salt and cursing anyone who dared to rebuild it was widespread in the [[ancient Near East]], but historical accounts are unclear as to what the sowing of salt meant in that process.{{cn|date=November 2018|reason=wikipedians themselves cannot claim something is unknown; you need a ref whaichsays this}}

Various [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Assyria]]n texts speak of ceremonially strewing salt, minerals, or plants ([[weed]]s, "cress", or ''kudimmu'', which are associated with salt and desolation&lt;ref&gt;Weinfeld, Moshe. ''Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School'', 1992, {{ISBN|0-931464-40-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7vSnbQKLyCYC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=kudimmu p. 110]&lt;/ref&gt;) over destroyed cities, including [[Hattusa]], [[Taite|Taidu]], [[Arinna]], [[Hunusa]],&lt;ref name="Gevritz"/&gt; [[Irridu]],&lt;ref&gt;Chavalas, Mark. ''The ancient Near East: historical sources in translation'' pp. 144-5.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Susa]].&lt;ref&gt;''Persians: Masters of Empire'', by the editors of [[Time-Life]] Books. Alexandria, Va.: Time-Life Books, 1995. {{ISBN|0-8094-9104-4}} pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Book of Judges]]'' (9:45) says that [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]], the [[Biblical judges|judge]] of the [[Israelite]]s, sowed his own capital, [[Shechem]], with salt, c. 1050 BC, after quelling a revolt against him. This may have been part of a [[Herem (war or property)|ḥērem]] ritual&lt;ref name="Gevritz"/&gt; (see [[Salt in the Bible]]).

Starting in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Ripley, George |authorlink= George Ripley (transcendentalist) |author2=[[Charles Anderson Dana]]  |title= The New American Cyclopædia: a Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge |volume=4 |page=39 |year= 1863 |url= https://archive.org/stream/americancyclopae04ripl#page/38/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; various texts claim that the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] general [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus]] plowed over and sowed the city of [[Carthage]] with salt after defeating it in the [[Third Punic War]] (146 BC), sacking it, and [[slavery|enslaving]] the survivors.  Though ancient sources do mention symbolically drawing a plow over various cities, and salting them, none mention Carthage in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, 1988, pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Carthage story is a later invention, probably modeled on the story of [[Shechem]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Boniface VIII|Pope Boniface VIII]] destroyed [[Palestrina]] in 1299, he ordered that it be plowed "following the old example of Carthage in Africa", and also salted.&lt;ref&gt;Warmington, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; "I have run the plough over it, like the ancient Carthage of Africa, and I have had salt sown upon it...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sedgwick, Henry Dwight |authorlink= Henry Dwight Sedgwick |title=Italy In The Thirteenth Century, Part Two |year=2005 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC |page=324 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAogBss02bIC |isbn=978-1-4179-6638-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The text is not clear as to whether he thought Carthage was salted. Later accounts of other saltings in the destructions of medieval Italian cities are now rejected as unhistorical: [[Padua]] by [[Attila]] (452), perhaps in a parallel between Attila and the ancient Assyrians; [[Milan]] by [[Frederick Barbarossa]] (1162); and [[Semifonte]] by the [[Florence|Florentines]] (1202).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2855837 |pages=429–450 |last1=Oerter |first1=H. L. |title=Campaldino, 1289 |volume=43 |issue=3 |journal=Speculum |year=1968 |doi=10.2307/2855837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English epic poem ''[[Siege of Jerusalem (poem)|Siege of Jerusalem]]'' (c. 1370) recounts that [[Titus]] commanded the sowing of salt on the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]],&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Ralph and David Lawton, eds., ''The Siege of Jerusalem'', 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N_Ia3C6eMzgC&amp;pg=PA88 line 1295]&lt;/ref&gt; but this episode is not found in [[Josephus]].

==Punishing traitors==

[[File:Padrão do Chão Salgado.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Stone memorial to the [[Duke of Aveiro]]'s punishment in [[Santa Maria de Belém]], [[Lisbon]]. ]]
In [[Spain]] and the [[Spanish Empire]], salt was poured onto the land owned by a convicted traitor (often one who was executed and their head placed on a ''picota'', or pike, afterwards) after their house was demolished.

This was done in [[Portugal]] as well. The last known event of this sort was the destruction of the [[Duke of Aveiro]]'s palace in [[Lisbon]] in 1759, due to his participation in the [[Távora affair]] (a conspiracy against King [[Joseph I of Portugal]]). His palace was demolished and his land was salted.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Hughes, ''An authentick letter from Mr. Hughes, a Gentleman residing at Lisbon...'', London 1759, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hmNZAAAAcAAJ&amp;q=salt p. 25]&lt;/ref&gt; A stone memorial now perpetuates the memory of the shame of the Duke, where it is written:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this place were put to the ground and salted the houses of José Mascarenhas, stripped of the honours of Duque de Aveiro and others.... Put to Justice as one of the leaders of the most barbarous and execrable upheaval that... was committed against the most royal and sacred person of the Lord Joseph I. In this infamous land nothing may be built for all time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Portuguese [[Colonial Brazil|colony of Brazil]], the leader of the [[Inconfidência Mineira]], [[Tiradentes]], was sentenced to death and his house was "razed and salted, so that never again be built up on the floor, ... and even the floor will rise up a standard by which the memory is preserved (preserving) the infamy of this heinous offender..."&lt;ref name="ws"&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Sentença proferida contra os réus do levante e conjuração de Minas Gerais |wslink=pt:Sentença proferida contra os réus do levante e conjuração de Minas Gerais |year=1789|location=Brazil |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered further indignities, being [[hanged]] and quartered, his body parts carried to various parts of the country where his fellow revolutionaries had met, and his children deprived of their property and honor.&lt;ref name="ws" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Southey |first= Robert |authorlink= Robert Southey |title= History of Brazil |volume= 3 |location= London |publisher= Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown |year= 1819 |page= 684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Worcester |first= Donald E. |title= Brazil, From Colony to World Power |location= New York |publisher= Scribner |year= 1973 |page= 52 |isbn= 0-684-13386-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bishop |first= Elizabeth |title= Brazil |location= New York |publisher= Time |year= 1962 |page= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==

An ancient legend says that [[Odysseus]] [[feigned madness]] by yoking a horse and an ox to his plow and sowing salt.&lt;ref&gt;The story does not appear in [[Homer]], but was apparently mentioned in [[Sophocles]]' lost tragedy ''The Mad Ulysses'': [[James George Frazer]], ''ed.'', ''Apollodorus: [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|The Library]]'', '''II''':[https://books.google.com/books?id=hDhgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=sowed%20salt 176 footnote 2]; [[Hyginus]], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html#95 ''Fabulae'' '''95'''] mentions the mismatched animals but not the salt.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scotland Loves Animation''' is an arts and education charity, that holds an annual [[film festival]] focussed on [[Japanese animation]] called "Scotland Loves Anime" in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=site&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovesanimation.com/about-us/|accessdate=2017-02-25|date=2016|website=lovesanimation.com|title=Scotland Loves Anime - ABOUT US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Scotland Loves Animation is a [[registered charity|registered Scottish charity]] for the promotion of animation - screening premieres, classics and hosting talks, education days and more.

Established in 2010, Scotland Loves Animation promotes animation worldwide with a core selection of events running in October each year. Based across three of Scotland’s cultural hubs: [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], and [[Dundee]], Scotland Loves Animation offers premiere screenings, exhibitions, workshops and international guests.

The focus of 2010 was on Japanese animation, with a double-screening of ''[[Evangelion 1.0]]'' and ''[[Evangelion 2.0]]'' (the UK premiere was in Glasgow the previous year 2009), as well as a full festival called Scotland Loves Anime in October 2010.

Scotland Loves Animation offers a platform for recent graduates, and will run an educational programme geared towards inspiring, improving, and celebrating graduates’ works.  This year’s guests included [[Jonathan Clements]], [[Oscar Wright]] and [[Nik Taylor]]. This is achieved through an Education Day that run as part of the festival whereby top industry professionals are invited to meet student in a full day of talks, panel discussions, and workshops.

==Event dates, locations and venues==
In October 2010, Scotland Loves Animation created several events celebrating Japanese animation under the umbrella name of "Scotland Loves Anime" and ran them in the [[Glasgow Film Theatre]] in [[Glasgow]] and the [[Edinburgh Filmhouse]] in [[Edinburgh]]. The festival will be run again in October 2011. During the rest of the year they collaborate with other events, including the [[Glasgow Film Festival]] and the [[Glasgow Youth Film Festival]], to program animated content.

==We Love Anime and other events==
In 2011, Scotland Loves Animation announced another project called "We Love Anime" that will tour [[Anime]] content across the UK and Ireland.  It is scheduled to begin on March 26, 2011 and end in July 2011. Locations include: [[Edinburgh]], [[Birmingham]], [[Leeds]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Dumfries]], [[Dublin]], [[Bexley]] and [[London]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2484">'''Starkers!''' is a monthly [[nudity|naked]] [[club night]] in London since 2003. It says it is the first and only regular night of its kind in [[England]] not segregated by gender and open to adults of all ages and [[sexual orientation]]. The [[dress code]] stipulates both men and women undress except for footwear, required for safety. The [[undress code]] extends to most staff.

The concept of ''Starkers!'' emerged from the underground [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] and [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger]] scenes of [[East London]] in late 2003 when a nude barman at such an establishment launched the event after suggestions from co-workers and club patrons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nudistday.com/article/london-has-the-worlds-biggest-nude-disco.html Nudistday.com, "London has the world's biggest nude disco"]&lt;/ref&gt; An early event was featured in an edition of [[H&amp;E naturist]] magazine in 2004. Later in 2004 the event moved to a [[pub]] near [[Columbia Road]] in [[Bethnal Green]] where it rapidly gained a following among of the [[gay]] community. After police prevented the club continuing at its current home ''Starkers!'' relocated to a nightclub in [[Vauxhall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lightseekinglight.blogspot.co.uk/2005/10/another-cultural-indicator-starkers.html Another Cultural Indicator -- Starkers! Nude Disco via "I'm in the nude for dancing" by Robert Dex, South London Press, October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 2006 the event moved to a close to [[London Bridge]] where it entertained up to 400 naked clubbers every month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nudistday.com/article/london-has-the-worlds-biggest-nude-disco.html Ibid]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the event was again forced to close, after a Scottish newspaper story.

''Starkers!'' moved to a [[lap dancing]] venue in [[Shoreditch]] in late 2007 where it remained for several months. In summer 2008 the club relocated to Vauxhall where it remained until late 2010. Since 2012 the club has been in [[Dalston]].

''Starkers!'' was second ''Club of the Year'' in the 2006 [[Erotic Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erotic-awards.co.uk/2006/ 2006 Erotic Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060223045145/http://www.erotic-awards.co.uk/2006/ |date=2006-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Teatro Alfieri''' was a major theatre and opera house in 18th and 19th century [[Florence]], located at Via dell'Ulivo #6 corner Via Pietrapiana in the [[Florence]], region of Tuscany, Italy. 

==History==
It was constructed originally in 1740 by members of the ''Accademia dei Risoluti''. At that time it was known as the ''Teatro di Santa Maria'' (the name of a nearby street) or the ''Teatro Risoluti''. The theatre underwent extensive reconstruction and enlargement in 1828, supervised by the architect [[Vittorio Bellini]] (1798 - 1860).&lt;ref&gt;Sistema Archivistico Nazionale. [http://www.san.beniculturali.it/web/san/dettaglio-soggetto-produttore?id=8578 "Bellini, Vittorio, architetto, (Firenze 1798 - 1860)"]. Retrieved 18 December 2013 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It re-opened as the Teatro Alfieri, named in honour of the playwright [[Vittorio Alfieri]].

In its heyday, the theatre interior decorations were elaborate, was used for both prose drama and operas. In the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, it also became known as a performance venue for plays written in the [[Florentine dialect]]. The theatre was demolished in 1928 when the Fascist government of Florence re-developed the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]] district.&lt;ref&gt;Garlington, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The story is based on an account of two convicts of the [[First Fleet]], [[Henry Cabell (convict)|Henry Cabell]] and [[Susannah Holmes]] as given by Norfolk historian Eric Fowler. According to Fowler's research, which begins in 1783, young Henry Cabell receives a sentence of [[Penal transportation|transportation]] for fourteen years for the burglary of a country house. Another youngster, Susannah Holmes, receives a sentence of transportation for an unrelated theft. They are imprisoned for three years (because Britain has recognised the United States and can no longer send convicts there) before being sent to New South Wales. While imprisoned they fall in love and produce a son. Refused permission to marry, Susannah (along with all the women) is to be sent alone in the [[First Fleet]] to Australia. When Susannah's son is refused passage at quayside a guard (John Simpson) takes pity on her and travels with the infant to London to appeal to the home secretary, [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney|Lord Sydney]]. Sydney, affected by the incident, orders that Cabell and Holmes should be reunited, married on English soil, and transported together with their son (although they were not married until their arrival in Australia). Cabell eventually becomes a constable in the new colony and enjoys commercial success.

==Recordings==

"The Transports - Silver Edition" was released by Free Reed on the occasion of its 25th anniversary, with the original recordings and also re-recordings of many tracks by modern-day folk artists, FRDCD-2122.

Both of the Australian and British offences were derived from or inspired by the related offence of [[treason]]. The name treachery was chosen because it is a [[synonym]] for treason.

==Australia==
'''Treachery''' is a [[statutory]] [[offence (law)|offence]] in [[Australia]]. The offence is created by section 24AA of the [[Crimes Act 1914]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/s24aa.html |title=CRIMES ACT 1914 - SECT 24AA Treachery |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
{{see also|Treachery Act of 1934}}

==United Kingdom==
{{see also|Treachery Act 1940}}

The Treachery Act 1940 created the offense to prosecute and execute enemy spies. Suspended in 1946, the statutory offence bearing that name in the [[United Kingdom]] was repealed in 1973.

The '''Uprising of Ivaylo''' ({{lang-bg|Въстанието на Ивайло}}) was a rebellion of the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] peasantry against the incompetent rule of Emperor [[Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria|Constantine Tikh]] and the Bulgarian nobility. The revolt was fuelled mainly by the failure of the central authorities to confront the [[Mongol]] menace in north-eastern Bulgaria. The Mongols had looted and ravaged the Bulgarian population for decades, especially in the region of [[Dobrudzha]]. The weakness of the state institutions was a result of the accelerating process of [[Feudalism|feudalisation]] of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]].

The peasants' leader [[Ivaylo of Bulgaria|Ivaylo]], said to had been a [[swineherd]] by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers, proved to be a successful general and charismatic leader. In the first months of the rebellion, he defeated the Mongols and the [[Tsar]]'s armies, personally slaying Constantine Tikh in battle. Later, he made a triumphant entry in the capital [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]], married [[Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene|Maria]], the emperor's widow, and forced the nobility to recognize him as [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|Emperor of Bulgaria]].

The Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] tried to exploit this situation to his favour and intervened in Bulgaria. He sent [[Ivan Asen III of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen III]], son of the former Emperor [[Mitso Asen of Bulgaria|Mitso Asen]], to claim the Bulgarian throne at the head of a large Byzantine army. Simultaneously, Michael VIII incited the Mongols to attack from the north, forcing Ivaylo to fight on two fronts. Ivaylo was defeated by the Mongols and besieged in important fortress of [[Silistra|Drastar]]. In his absence the nobility in Tarnovo opened the gates to Ivan Asen III. However, Ivaylo managed to break the siege and Ivan Asen III fled back to the Byzantine Empire. Michael VIII sent two large armies in an attempt to turn the fortunes of the war, but they were both defeated by the Bulgarian rebels in the [[Balkan mountains]].

In the meantime, the nobility in the capital had proclaimed as emperor one of their own, the magnate [[George I of Bulgaria|George Terter I]]. Surrounded by enemies and with diminishing support due to the constant warfare, Ivaylo fled to the court of the Mongol warlord [[Nogai Khan]] to seek aid, but was eventually murdered. The legacy of the rebellion endured both in Bulgaria and in Byzantium. Years after the demise of the peasant emperor, two "Pseudo-Ivaylos" appeared in the Byzantine Empire and enjoyed wide support by the populace.

==Background==

===Political situation of Bulgaria===
Following the demise of [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]] (r. 1218–1241), the large Bulgarian Empire began to decline as a result of a succession of infant emperors and internal struggles among the nobility. To the north the country faced [[Mongol invasion of Bulgaria and Serbia|a Mongol invasion in 1242]] and constant raiding thereafter. Although Ivan Asen II defeated the Mongols shortly before his death,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; the regency of [[Kaliman I of Bulgaria|Kaliman I Asen]] (r. 1241–1246) agreed to pay an annual tribute to the Mongols to avoid devastation. The Mongol invasion led to the collapse of the loosely held [[Cumania|Cuman confederation]] in the western part of the [[Eurasian Steppe]] and the foundation of the Mongol [[Golden Horde]]. This had long–term political and strategic consequences for Bulgaria&amp;nbsp;— the [[Cumans]] were Bulgarian allies and often supplied the [[Medieval Bulgarian army|Bulgarian army]] with auxiliary cavalry while the Golden Horde proved to be a hostile entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1987|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the south, Bulgaria lost large portions of [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to the [[Nicaean Empire]], which had escaped the initial Mongol attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1987|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lands to the north-west, including [[Belgrade]], [[Braničevo (region)|Braničevo]] and [[Severin Banat]], were conquered by the [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bakalov|co|2003|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1256 Bulgaria descended into a civil war between [[Mitso Asen of Bulgaria|Mitso Asen]] (r. 1256–1257), a relative of Ivan Asen II, who established himself in south-eastern Bulgaria, and the [[bolyar]] of [[Skopje]] [[Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria|Constantine Tikh]] (r. 1257–1277), who was proclaimed emperor by the nobility in Tarnovo. Simultaneously, the Hungarian noble of [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] princely origin [[Rostislav Mikhailovich]] established himself in [[Vidin]] as another claimant of the title [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|Emperor of Bulgaria]] and was recognized as such by the Kingdom of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|pp=508–509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1987|pp=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1261 Constantine Tikh had emerged as victor, but his 20–year-long reign did not bring stability to Bulgaria: Vidin remained separated from the central authorities in Tarnovo,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1987|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Mongols regularly campaigned in north-eastern Bulgaria, looting the countryside and paralysing the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] (r. 1259–1282) seized [[Constantinople]] and restored the [[Byzantine Empire]] as a major adversary of Bulgaria to the south. In the 1260s Constantine Tikh broke his leg in a hunting incident and was paralysed from the waist down.&lt;ref name="fine195"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1987|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disability weakened his control over the government and he fell under the influence of his second wife [[Irene Doukaina Laskarina]], who was constantly involved in intrigues with her relatives in the Byzantine court. Later, he left the state affairs to his third wife, [[Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene]]&amp;nbsp;— a scandalous intriguer whose actions to secure the succession of her son alienated the nobility.&lt;ref name="fine195"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|pp=513–514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal political development and feudalisation of Bulgaria in the 13th century resulted in a rising number of serfs, as well as an increase in the power of the landed nobility. This, in turn, led to aspirations for more self-rule among the most influential nobles. Many of them established semi-independent fiefdoms that nominally recognized the emperor in Tarnovo and greatly reduced the capacity of the central authorities to deal with external threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|co|1982|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 13th century, the peasantry was losing personal privileges to the benefit of the secular and religious feudal lords, which in turn reduced the peasants' income and opportunities, worsening their lives.&lt;ref name="angelov277"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|co|1982|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bakalov|co|2003|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the inability of Constantine Tikh to terminate the constant Mongol incursions in the north-east of the country shattered the pillars of the state institutions in [[Dobrudzha]] and contributed to the outbreak of the uprising and its swift success.&lt;ref name="angelov277"/&gt; The Mongol raids were carried out by the semi-independent chief [[Nogai Khan]], who was more powerful than the legitimate ruler of the [[Golden Horde]], [[Mengu-Timur]] (r. 1266–1280), and ruled over the steppes of modern [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="fine195"/&gt;

In this situation one [[Ivaylo of Bulgaria|Ivaylo]], a native of north-eastern Bulgaria, most likely the area near [[Provadia]],&lt;ref name="andreev221"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to incite the population to revolt. He was called by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers by the name ''Bardokva'' (lettuce) or ''Lakhanas'' (vegetable) and his real name is known only from a note, attached to the [[Svrljig|Svarlig]] gospel.&lt;ref name="angelov277"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bakalov|co|2003|pp=359–360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine historian [[George Pachymeres]] stated that he was a [[swineherd]] who took care of pigs for money.&lt;ref&gt;"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://promacedonia.org/gibi/10/gal/10_171.html p. 171]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the historian [[John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr.|John Fine]] notes that pigs were a major livestock product at the time and the possessor of a large herd could have been part of the elite of the local community.&lt;ref name="fine195"/&gt; Ivaylo claimed that he had visions from God to lead the people and that he was in contact with heaven and the saints.&lt;ref name="fine195"/&gt; In fact, his [[mysticism]] was deliberately used to swiftly gain support and followers among the religious villagers.&lt;ref name="andreev221"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bakalov360"&gt;{{harvnb|Bakalov|co|2003|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came to be seen by many Bulgarians as a God-given saviour.&lt;ref name="fine195"/&gt;

==Course of the rebellion==

===Initial victories===
{{rquote|left|Lakhanas engaged a Mongol falanga, attacked it with the men he led, crushed them thoroughly and again attacked another unit. Thus, in a few days he covered with glory.&lt;ref&gt;"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://promacedonia.org/gibi/10/gal/10_172.html p. 172]&lt;/ref&gt;|[[George Pachymeres]] on the victory of Ivaylo over the Mongols.}}
The rebellion broke out in the spring or summer of 1277 in north-eastern Bulgaria where the Mongol devastation was strongest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|co|1982|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1277 Ivaylo confronted and defeated a plundering Mongol unit. Another victory followed soon and by autumn all Mongols were driven out of Bulgarian territory.&lt;ref name="andreev222"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|co|1982|pp=280–281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having achieved what had eluded the Bulgarian arms for decades, his popularity and reputation rose quickly. Among his followers were an increasing number of nobles who were discontent with the intrigues of Empress Maria.&lt;ref name="fine195"/&gt; Ivaylo was hailed as Emperor by the people and many regions came under his control.&lt;ref name="andreev222"/&gt;

In the end of 1277 Constantine Tikh finally took measures to confront the rebels. He gathered a small army and advanced slowly as he had to travel in a chariot because of his injury. Ivaylo attacked and defeated this force, killing many of the emperor's close associates, while the rest of the army joined the rebels. Ivaylo personally slew Constantine Tikh, claiming that the emperor did nothing to keep his honour in the battle.&lt;ref name="andreev223"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|co|1982|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his triumph, Ivaylo began to seize the country's fortified cities, which surrendered and recognized him as emperor one by one. By the spring of 1278 only the capital Tarnovo remained under the control of Empress Maria.&lt;ref name="angelov282"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|co|1982|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine intervention and recognition of Ivaylo===
[[File:Michael VIII Palaiologos.jpg|right|250px|thumb|alt=A miniature of a medieval manuscript|[[Michael VIII Palaiologos]]]]
Meanwhile, the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] left [[Constantinople]] for [[Edirne|Adrianople]], situated close to the Byzantine–Bulgarian border, in order to monitor the events and to exploit the situation in Bulgaria in his favour.&lt;ref name="andreev223"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov282"/&gt; The demise of Constantine Tikh came as a shock for the Byzantines. Initially, Michael VIII considered marrying his daughter to Ivaylo, but eventually decided that it would be more favourable to install a protégé of his own.&lt;ref name="bakalov360"/&gt; His candidate was Ivan, son of former Emperor Mitso Asen, who had sought asylum in Byzantium and possessed estates in [[Asia Minor]]. Ivan promptly married Michael VIII's daughter [[Irene Palaiologina, Empress of Bulgaria|Irene]], pledged allegiance to Michael VIII and was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria as [[Ivan Asen III of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|pp=230–231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fine196"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1987|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines sent gifts to the Bulgarian nobles to incite them to support Ivan Asen III and envoys were dispatched to Tarnovo to arrange for his recognition and the surrender of Empress Maria.&lt;ref name="angelov282"/&gt; In the meantime, Ivan Asen III marched north at the head of a Byzantine army while Ivaylo was besieging Tarnovo.&lt;ref name="fine196"/&gt;

Faced with two adversaries, Maria initially tried to negotiate with Michael VIII the succession of her son [[Michael Asen II of Bulgaria|Michael Asen]] but the Byzantine emperor insisted on an unconditional surrender.&lt;ref name="angelov282"/&gt; Much to the surprise of the Byzantines, Maria then entered in negotiations with Ivaylo and offered him her hand and the Bulgarian crown on the condition that he would guarantee the rights of Michael Asen as his sole successor.&lt;ref name="andreev224"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary chronicler George Pachymeres accuses Maria of "ignoring the moral duty to her late husband"&lt;ref&gt;"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://promacedonia.org/gibi/10/gal/10_177.html p. 177]&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact her decision was driven by her hatred towards her uncle Michael VIII, whom she considered a heretic{{cref|a}}, as well as by her desire to hang on to power.&lt;ref name="andreev224"/&gt; At first, Ivaylo was reluctant to accept the proposal claiming that Maria was offering what he was about to take by force&lt;ref name="andreev224"/&gt; but eventually conceded "because of the peace and to avoid bloodshed in a civil war".&lt;ref name="pachymeres178"&gt;"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://promacedonia.org/gibi/10/gal/10_178.html p. 178]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ivaylo made it clear that he was the one giving clemency, not the one receiving it.&lt;ref name="andreev225"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1278 Ivaylo entered Tarnovo in triumph, married Maria and was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="andreev225"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bakalov361"&gt;{{harvnb|Bakalov|co|2003|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bozhilov518"&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=518}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since he was inexperienced in state affairs, Ivaylo failed to consolidate his authority over the nobility in the capital, who were concerned for their own influence, and often quarrelled with Maria.&lt;ref name="andreev225"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fine197"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1987|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; He still had to deal with overwhelming challenges&amp;nbsp;— the Byzantines dispatched many troops under the command of [[Michael Doukas Glabas Tarchaneiotes|Michael Glabas]] in support of Ivan Asen III and incited the Mongols to attack from the north to open war on two fronts. Yet Ivaylo vigorously prepared his forces to counter the adversaries and managed to gain support among many nobles.&lt;ref name="pachymeres178"/&gt;

===Campaigns against Byzantines and Mongols===
Ivaylo left Tarnovo in the summer of 1278, marched northwards and defeated the Mongols, pushing them across the [[Danube]] river.&lt;ref name="andreev226"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov285"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|co|1982|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation to the south was more dangerous. The Byzantines launched an attack on a wide front along the [[Balkan Mountains]] from the [[Shipka Pass]] to the [[Black Sea]]. They failed to cross the mountains as the defenders held on until the Mongols were defeated and reinforcement could be sent.&lt;ref name="angelov285"/&gt; Despite the huge efforts and numerical superiority the Byzantines made few gains at very high cost.&lt;ref name="bakalov361"/&gt; For instance, the fortress of [[Ktenia (fortress)|Ktenia]] was seized after many assaults, the castles of [[Kran, Stara Zagora Province|Kran]] and [[Maglizh]] fell with heavy casualties for the invaders.&lt;ref name="angelov285"/&gt; The Bulgarian commander Stan fell valiantly during the defence of [[Stara Zagora|Boruy]] and many other of Ivaylo's associates distinguished themselves in the war&amp;nbsp;— Momchil, Kuman, Damyan, Kancho.&lt;ref name="andreev226"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov285"/&gt; All battles led personally by Ivaylo were successful&amp;nbsp;— he fought at Studena and Pirgitsa&lt;ref name="angelov285"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;— and by the autumn of 1278 the Bulgarians gained the upper hand forcing the Byzantines to abandon the campaign.&lt;ref name="andreev226"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov285"/&gt; The Byzantine [[morale]] was very low because Ivaylo gave [[no quarter]]. George Pachymeres wrote that "to fall in the hands of Lakhanas [Ivaylo] was equivalent to death".&lt;ref&gt;"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://promacedonia.org/gibi/10/gal/10_179.html p. 179]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Uprising of Ivaylo.png|left|250px|thumb|alt=A map of the Bulgarian Empire in the mid 13th century|A map of the Bulgarian Empire, showing the movement of the Bulgarian, Byzantine and Mongol armies during the rebellion]]
With the situation to the south under control, Ivaylo had to confront a second Mongol attack to the north. This time the Bulgarians faced the elite forces of Nogai Khan. The Mongols prevailed and Ivaylo was besieged in the important city of [[Silistra|Drastar]] on the southern bank of Danube, where he withstood a three-month siege.&lt;ref name="andreev226"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov286"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|co|1982|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; While bulk of the rebel army was engaged to the north, Michael VIII started negotiations with the nobility of Tarnovo and convinced the local dignitaries to recognize the claim of Ivan Asen III.&lt;ref name="angelov286"/&gt; In the beginning of 1279, a Byzantine army under Michael Glabas disembarked near [[Varna]] and set off to the capital, supported by a Mongol unit commanded by Kasim beg.&lt;ref name="fine197"/&gt; The elite of Tarnovo spread rumours that Ivaylo had perished fighting the Mongols and opened the gates to the Byzantines and their protégé. Ivan Asen III was proclaimed emperor and Maria, who at the time bore Ivaylo's child, was exiled to Constantinople.&lt;ref name="bakalov361"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bozhilov518"/&gt;&lt;ref name="andreev226"/&gt; To consolidate the support of the nobility, the new monarch married his sister [[Kira Maria Asenina of Bulgaria|Kira Maria]] to [[George I of Bulgaria|George Terter]], one of Bulgaria's most powerful and influential feudal lords, whose estates were centred at [[Cherven (fortress)|Cherven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasim beg, who had been awarded the high court title ''[[protostrator]]'', felt that the rise of George Terter was at his expense, deserted Ivan Asen III and joined the cause of Ivaylo.&lt;ref name="angelov287"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|co|1982|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime fighting between the rebels and the Byzantines continued. Although the Bulgarian forces were cut in two following the Byzantine landing at Varna, heavy clashes erupted in the eastern Balkan mountains with new vigour, especially around the [[Kotel Pass]] and the [[Varbitsa Pass]].&lt;ref name="angelov286"/&gt; The Bulgarian positions there were surrounded both from the north and the south. The Byzantines had to besiege and take the fortresses one by one which cost time and casualties. Many strongholds remained unconquered and permanently engaged large Byzantine forces.&lt;ref name="angelov287"/&gt;

In the spring of 1279, Ivaylo managed to break through the Mongol blockade at Drastar and besieged Tarnovo. This advance took Ivan Asen III and his supporters by surprise.&lt;ref name="angelov287"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|pp=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael VIII took measures to protect his protégé and in the summer of 1279 sent a 10,000-strong army under the command of the ''[[protovestiarios]]'' Murin. Ivaylo did not linger in Tarnovo and engaged the invading host on 17 June 1279 in the Kotel Pass. Despite being outnumbered, in the [[battle of Devina|ensuing battle near the fortress of Devina]] the Bulgarians achieved a complete victory. Part of the Byzantines perished in the battle along with their commander, the rest were captured and killed by orders of Ivaylo.&lt;ref name="bakalov361"/&gt;&lt;ref name="andreev227"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov288"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|co|1982|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, the Byzantines sent another army of 5,000 troops led by the ''protovestiarios'' Aprin. Ivaylo engaged them in the eastern Balkan Mountains on 15 August 1279 and after a long combat defeated the Byzantines, personally killing Aprin in the process.&lt;ref name="andreev227"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov288"/&gt; Ivaylo was said to had "fought with fury, achieving many feats"&lt;ref&gt;"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://promacedonia.org/gibi/10/gal/10_181.html p. 181]&lt;/ref&gt; in both battles.

===End of the rebellion and demise of Ivaylo===
[[File:Tsarevets-Panorama11.JPG|right|500px|thumb|alt=A medieval fortress |Panoramic view of [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]], the capital of the Bulgarian Empire]]
With the Byzantines defeated, the authority of Ivan Asen III was shaken. He and his wife Irene secretly fled Tarnovo taking the Byzantine imperial insignia, kept in the treasury since the Bulgarian victory in the [[battle of Tryavna]] in 1190.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cref|b}} Michael VIII was infuriated with the cowardliness of the couple and refused to grant them an audience for days.&lt;ref name="angelov288"/&gt; In Tarnovo, the nobility refused to open the gates to Ivaylo and instead elected for emperor George Terter, which had devastating effect on the rebels.&lt;ref name="andreev227"/&gt; Despite the military successes, neither was the Mongol threat dealt with, nor was Ivaylo capable to secure the support of the Bulgarian nobility and unify the country against the overwhelming forces of the Mongols and the Byzantines. As a result, Ivaylo's followers, disillusioned with the endless wars without prospects for peace, began to abandon his cause. With diminished support, in 1280 Ivaylo crossed the Danube with a few loyal associates, including Kasim beg, to seek aid from Nogai Khan.&lt;ref name="bakalov361"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fine198"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1987|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Ivaylo was received well by Nogai Khan. When news of his whereabouts reached Constantinople, Michael VIII sent Ivan Asen III with rich gifts to the Mongol court to ask assistance.&lt;ref name="angelov288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fine198"/&gt;&lt;ref name="andreev228"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nogai Khan expressed interest in the issue and for several months kept promising help to both pretenders. Eventually the Byzantine influence prevailed because the Mongol leader was married to the illegitimate daughter of Michael VIII, Euphrosyne Palaiologina.&lt;ref name="andreev228"/&gt; During a feast, in which Ivaylo and Ivan Asen III seated on both sides of Nogai Khan, he pointed at Ivaylo with the words "He is an enemy of my father, the Emperor [Michael VIII], and does not deserve to live"&lt;ref&gt;"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://promacedonia.org/gibi/10/gal/10_182.html p. 182]&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered his execution. Ivaylo, along with Kasim beg, were duly murdered on the spot.&lt;ref name="bakalov361"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="andreev228"/&gt; Ivan Asen III was fortunate to avoid similar fate due to the advocacy of Euphrosyne and eventually returned to his estates in Asia Minor, where he died in 1303.&lt;ref name="fine198"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|pp=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivaylo's legacy enjoyed huge popularity beyond the borders of Bulgaria years after his death. At least two "Pseudo-Ivaylos" appeared in the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref name="andreev229"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1284 a Bulgarian who claimed to had been Ivaylo, arrived in Constantinople and offered his services to Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] to fight against the [[Turkish people|Turks]].&lt;ref name="angelov290"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|co|1982|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andronikos II asked the ex-empress Maria to verify if the man was her husband and she exposed him as an imposter. Pseudo-Ivaylo was detained but the populace demanded his release since the Turks "feared the barbarian [Ivaylo]".&lt;ref name="pachymeres187"/&gt; The Byzantine emperor calculated that there was nothing to lose and allowed him to march against the Turks. "Ivaylo" gathered a huge army of peasants, much to the concern of the Byzantine nobility who feared a revolt or coup. The emperor then summoned Pseudo-Ivaylo under some pretext and had him imprisoned.&lt;ref name="angelov290"/&gt; A few years later another Bulgarian (whose real name was Ivan) appeared in the Byzantine Empire claiming he was Ivaylo. He was given an army to combat the Turks but after a few victories he was captured and killed.&lt;ref name="angelov290"/&gt;

In Bulgaria, the two decades following the end of the rebellion marked the lowest point of decline of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Second Empire]].&lt;ref name="angelov290"/&gt; The reigns of [[George I of Bulgaria|George Terter I]] (r. 1280–1292) and his successor [[Smilets of Bulgaria|Smilets]] (r. 1292–1298) were characterised with constant Mongol interference in the state's domestic affairs and progressive disintegration of Imperial authority in favour of the feudal magnates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|pp=238, 242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria had lost almost all lands to the south of the Balkan mountains to the Byzantines and was in no position to regain these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1987|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortunes of the country changed for the better under George Terter I's son, [[Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria|Theordore Svetoslav]] (r. 1300–1321), when Bulgaria acquired [[Bessarabia]] from the Mongols and reconquered [[Northern Thrace]] from the Byzantines, bringing stability and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

The rebellion failed because the rebels had to fight against overwhelming odds&amp;nbsp;— not only the Byzantines and the Mongols, but also much of the Bulgarian nobility.&lt;ref name="bakalov361"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov288"/&gt; Although ultimately unsuccessful, the uprising of Ivaylo had achieved a recognition of its leader as emperor, an aim in which all other [[Popular revolt in late-medieval Europe|popular revolts in medieval Europe]] failed. In [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Socialist Bulgaria]] the rebellion was portrayed as a social movement against the iniquity of the feudal system and the foreign invaders.&lt;ref name="fine196"/&gt; In modern Bulgaria Ivaylo is still revered as a fighter for freedom and social justice.&lt;ref name="andreev229"/&gt; However, there is no evidence that Ivaylo and his followers ever intended to conduct social reforms.&lt;ref name="fine196"/&gt; The fact that the rebellion was supported by some nobles and that Ivaylo married the hated Empress Maria also indicates that the main factor was the incompetent rule of Emperor Constantine Tikh.&lt;ref name="fine196"/&gt; The Bulgarian historians praise the heroism of the rebels and evaluate the uprising as a bright patriotic achievement of the Bulgarian people because Ivaylo was able to gather wide support from all social classes of Bulgaria to defend the then-troubled country against the external enemies.&lt;ref name="bakalov361"/&gt;&lt;ref name="andreev228"/&gt; Ivaylo is remembered as a heroic ruler and a tragic figure who represented the ideal of the "Good Tsar".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|pp=222, 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebellion of Ivaylo is among the most popular and recognizable Bulgarian historical events with numerous pieces of art dedicated to it. The 1959 [[opera]] "Ivaylo" by the composer [[Marin Goleminov]], based on the [[overture]] of the same name by [[Dobri Hristov]], was inspired by the "revolutionary pathos and tragedy of the epoch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Book for the Opera|url=http://chitanka.info/text/8501/68|last=Sagaev|first=Lyubomir|year=1983|language=Bulgarian|chapter=Ivaylo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated to the uprising are also the 1964 colour [[feature film]] "Ivaylo" by the director Nikola Valchev, based on the novel "The Smouldering Ember" by Evgeni Konstantinov,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311351/|title=Ivaylo (1964)|website=IMDb|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1921 drama "The Throne" by the prominent Bulgarian poet and writer [[Ivan Vazov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://litclub.bg/library/bg/kanon.htm|title=Bulgarian Literature from 1879 to 1988|website=Literary Club|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Ivaylovgrad]] in modern southern Bulgaria and the village of [[Ivaylo (village)|Ivaylo]] near the city of [[Pazardzhik]] are named after the rebel leader. There are statues in several cities dedicated to him, as well as a monument commemorating the victory over the Byzantines in the battle of Devina, situated at 5&amp;nbsp;km to the south-east of the town of [[Kotel, Bulgaria|Kotel]]. That memorial, named "The Stone Guard", was listed in the top ten emblematic monuments on the history of Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economic.bg/bg/news/3/10-emblematichni-pametnika-za-bulgarskata-istoriya.html|title=Ten Emblematic Monuments on Bulgarian History|website=Economic.bg|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journeynotebook.com/poi/607/pametnik-ivailo-kotel|title=Monument of Ivaylo - Kotel|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notes===
{{Cnote|a|The [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] vigorously opposed the attempts to reunite the Orthodox and the Catholic Churches sponsored by Michael VIII and the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. The Bulgarian patriarch Ignatius and empress Maria criticised them for their apparent willingness to make concessions at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1272–1274.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=514}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Cnote|b|In the [[battle of Tryavna]] in 1190 the Bulgarians captured the Byzantine imperial treasure, including the golden helmet of the Byzantine Emperors, the crown and the Imperial Cross, which was considered the most valuable possession of the Byzantine rulers&amp;nbsp;— a [[reliquary]] of solid gold containing a piece of the [[True Cross]]. These trophies became part of the Bulgarian treasury and were carried around Tarnovo during official occasions until 1279, when Ivan Asen III took them during his flight from the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''War bride''' is a term used in reference to women who married military personnel from other countries in times of [[war]] or during [[military occupation]]s, especially–but not exclusively–during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

Among the largest and best documented examples of this were the marriages between American servicemen and German women which took place after World War II. By 1949, over 20,000 German war brides had emigrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=363|title=The Atlantic Times :: Archive|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225031525/http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=363|archivedate=25 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, it is estimated that there are "... 15,000 Australian women who married American servicemen based in Australia during World War II and moved to the US to be with their husbands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Mitchell |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Aussie brides reunite |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21623761-5001028,00.html |work= |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]] |date=2007-04-26 |accessdate=2008-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225064638/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21623761-5001028,00.html |archivedate=December 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] servicemen also married many women in other countries where they were stationed at the end of the war, including [[France]], [[Italy]],&lt;ref name="RAI Storia"&gt;{{cite web|author=Francesco Conversano|author2=Nené Grignaffini|title=Italiani: spose di guerra.

This also occurred in [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] with the later wars in those countries involving U.S. troops and other [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] soldiers. As many as 70,000 [[G.I. (military)|GI]] war brides left the United Kingdom, 150,000 to 200,000 hailed from continental Europe, 15,500 from Australia and 1,500 from New Zealand, between the years 1942 and 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americainwwii.com/stories/warbrides.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105060751/http://www.americainwwii.com/stories/warbrides.htm |archivedate=2008-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippine-American War==
Due to the [[Philippine Insurrection]], a few U.S. servicemen would take Filipinas as their wives, with documentation as early as 1902 of one immigrating with their servicemember husband to the UK. These Filipinas were already [[United States nationality law#Nationals who are not citizens|U.S. nationals]], when immigrating to the United States, making their legal status significantly different from previous Asian immigrants to the US.&lt;ref name="Segal2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Uma Anand Segal|title=A Framework for Immigration: Asians in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fApm87FFxJ0C&amp;pg=PA146|year=2002|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-12082-1|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== War brides in World War II ==

===United States===
During and immediately after [[World War II]], more than 60,000 U.S. servicemen married women overseas and they were promised that their wives and children would receive free passage to the U.S. The [[United States Army|U.S. Army's]] "Operation War Bride", which eventually transported an estimated 70,000 women and children, began in Britain in early 1946. The press dubbed it "Operation Diaper Run". The first batch of war brides (452 British women and their 173 children and one Bridegroom) left Southampton harbor on [[SS Argentina (1929)|SS Argentina]] on January 26, 1946 and arrived in the U.S. on February 4, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWveOFiCUrcC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Masters of the Air: America's Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany|last=Miller|first=Donald L.|date=2006-10-10|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743298322|language=en, p.518,519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, an estimated 300,000 foreign war brides moved to the United States following the passage of the [[War Brides Act]] of 1945 and its subsequent amendments, of which 51,747 were Filipinos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Whatever happened to Filipino war brides in the US |author=Michael Lim Ubac |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/43451/whatever-happened-to-filipino-war-brides-in-us |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated 50,000 were Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Daughters tell stories of ‘war brides’ despised back home and in the U.S. |author=Lucy Alexander |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/10/05/how-tos/daughters-tell-stories-war-brides-despised-back-home-u-s/#.VicY0Svak7A |newspaper=The Japan Times|date=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robyn Arrowsmith, a historian who spent nine years researching Australia's war brides, said between 12,000 and 15,000 Australian women had married visiting U.S. servicemen and moved to the U.S. with their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/here-come-the-war-brides-a-love-story-65-years-on-20100417-slgs.html|title=Here come the war brides: a love story 65 years on|first=Scott|last=Ellis|date=18 April 2010|publisher=|via=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] women married American servicemen during the time of [[Ernest Harmon Air Force Base]]'s existence (1941-1966), in which tens of thousands of U.S. servicemen arrived to defend the island and North America from [[Nazi Germany]] during World War II and the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]]. Many of these war brides settled in the U.S., so much so that in 1966 the Newfoundland government created a tourism campaign specifically tailored to provide opportunities for them and their families to reunite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/american-marriages-stephenville.php|title=Marriage Between Americans and Newfoundlanders|website=Heritage.nf.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain===
Some war brides came from Australia to Britain aboard [[HMS Victorious (R38)#Postwar|HMS Victorious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishpathe.com/video/australian-brides-in-england|title=Australian Brides In England|website=Britishpathe.com|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:StateLibQld 1 77690 English war brides who arrived in Brisbane in October 1945.jpg|thumb|English war brides who arrived in [[Brisbane]] in October 1945]]
In 1945 and 1946 several [[Bride trains]] were run in Australia to transport war brides and their children travelling to or from ships.

About 650 Japanese war brides migrated to Australia after the ban on Japanese migration, imposed at the outbreak of the Pacific War, was lifted in 1952 when the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into force. They had married Australian soldiers involved in the [[occupation of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;James Jupp, ''The Australian people: an encyclopedia of the nation, its people and their origins'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, p 523.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
47,783 British war brides arrived in Canada accompanied by some 21,950 children. Since 1939, most Canadian soldiers were stationed in Britain. As such, about 90% of all war brides arriving in Canada were British. 3,000 war brides came from the Netherlands, Belgium, Newfoundland, France, Italy, Ireland and Scotland.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.canadianwarbrides.com/intro.asp |title= About the Canadian War Brides of WWII|website=Canadianwarbrides.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first marriage between a Canadian serviceman and a British bride was registered at Farnborough Church in the Aldershot area in December 1939, just 43 days after the first Canadian soldiers arrived.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Many of these war brides emigrated to Canada, beginning in 1944 and peaking in 1946. A special Canadian agency, the [[Canadian Wives' Bureau]] was set up by the Canadian Department of Defence to arrange transport and assist war brides in the transition to Canadian life. The majority of Canadian war brides landed at [[Pier 21]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], most commonly on the following troop and hospital ships: [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']], [[RMS Lady Nelson|''Lady Nelson'']], [[SS Letitia|''Letitia'']],  [[RMS Mauretania (1938)|''Mauretania'']], and [[SS Île de France|''Île de France'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pier21.ca/blog/jan-raska/major-waves-of-immigration-through-pier-21-war-brides-and-their-children|title=Major Waves of Immigration through Pier 21: War Brides and Their Children|last= Raska |first=Jan|date=|website=Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
During the campaign of 1943-1945, there were more than 10,000 marriages between Italian women and American soldiers.&lt;ref name="RAI Storia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Silvia Cassamagnaghi|title=Operazione Spose di guerra: Storie d'amore e di emigrazione|publisher=Feltrinelli|location=Milan|pp=319|isbn=9788858817216|language=it|url=https://books.google.it/books?isbn=8858817214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From relationship between Italian women and African-American soldiers, have born the "''[[mulatto|mulattini]]''": many of these children were abandoned in orphanages,&lt;ref name="RAI Storia"/&gt; because at the time the [[interracial marriage in the United States]] was not possible in many states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1943-1946: spose di guerra, storie d’amore e migrazione|date=2014-06-10|website=libereta.it|url=http://www.libereta.it/1943-1946-spose-guerra-storie-damore-migrazione.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Giorgio Boatti|title=Italia 1945, that’s amore.

===Japan===
Several thousand Japanese who were sent as colonizers to [[Manchukuo]] and Inner Mongolia were left behind in China. The majority of Japanese left behind in China were women, and these Japanese women mostly married Chinese men and became known as "stranded war wives" (zanryu fujin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://japanfocus.org/-Rowena-Ward/2374/article.html|title=Left Behind: Japan's Wartime Defeat and the Stranded Women of Manchukuo - The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus|first=The Asia Pacific|last=Journal|website=japanfocus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fDCsD-1zitUC&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mackerras 2003], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Because they had children fathered by Chinese men, the Japanese women were not allowed to bring their Chinese families back with them to Japan so most of them stayed. Japanese law only allowed children fathered by Japanese fathers to become Japanese citizens. However, recently{{clarify|date=September 2016}} Japan lifted the restrictions on the women and citizenship for children born to foreign men and they have been migrating back to Japan with their Chinese husbands and children.

==2003 Iraq War==
War brides from wars subsequent to Vietnam became less common due to differences in religion and culture, shorter durations of wars, and direct orders.
