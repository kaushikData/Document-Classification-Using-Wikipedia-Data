'''Accretion''' is the process of coastal sediment returning to the visible portion of a beach or foreshore following a [[Submersion (Coastal Management)|submersion]] event. A [[sustainable]] beach or foreshore often goes through a cycle of submersion during rough weather then accretion during calmer periods. If a coastline is not in a healthy sustainable state, then erosion can be more serious and accretion does not fully restore the original volume of the visible beach or foreshore leading to permanent beach loss.

[[File:Estuary-mouth.jpg|thumb|307px|right|An [[estuary]] mouth and coastal waters, part of an aquatic ecosystem]]

An '''aquatic ecosystem''' is an [[ecosystem]]  in a [[body of water]]. [[Biocoenosis|Communities]] of [[biota (ecology)|organisms]] that are dependent on each other and on their environment live in aquatic ecosystems. The two main types of aquatic ecosystems are [[marine ecosystem]]s and [[freshwater ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 0-412-74050-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Marine===
{{main|Marine ecosystem}}
Marine ecosystems, the largest of all ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University of California Museum of Paleontology: The Marine Biome|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/marine.php?|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; cover approximately 71% of the [[Earth's surface]] and contain approximately 97% of the planet's water. They generate 32% of the world's net [[primary production]].&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 0-412-74050-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are distinguished from freshwater ecosystems by the presence of dissolved [[chemical compound|compounds]], especially [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, in the water. Approximately 85% of the dissolved materials in [[seawater]] are [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]]. Seawater has an average salinity of 35 [[parts-per notation|parts per thousand]] of water. Actual salinity varies among different marine ecosystems.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web| last = United States Environmental Protection Agency| authorlink = United States Environmental Protection Agency| title = Marine Ecosystems| date = 2 March 2006| url = http://www.epa.gov/bioiweb1/aquatic/marine.html| accessdate = 2006-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:oceanic divisions.svg|thumb|300px|right|A classification of marine habitats.]]
Marine ecosystems can be divided into many zones depending upon water depth and shoreline features. The [[ocean]]ic zone is the vast open part of the ocean where animals such as whales, sharks, and tuna live.  The [[benthic]] zone consists of substrates below water where many invertebrates live. The [[intertidal zone|intertidal]] zone is the area between high and low tides; in this figure it is termed the littoral zone. Other near-shore (neritic) zones can include [[estuary|estuaries]], [[salt marsh]]es, [[coral reef]]s, [[lagoon]]s and [[mangrove]] swamps.  In the deep water, [[hydrothermal vent]]s may occur where [[Chemosynthesis|chemosynthetic]] [[sulfur]] [[bacteria]] form the base of the food web.

[[class (biology)|Classes]] of organisms found in marine ecosystems include [[brown algae]], [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[coral]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, and [[shark]]s. Fishes caught in marine ecosystems are the biggest source of commercial foods obtained from wild populations.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

Environmental problems concerning marine ecosystems include unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (for example [[overfishing]] of certain species), [[marine pollution]], [[Fisheries and climate change|climate change]], and building on coastal areas.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

===Freshwater===

{{main|Freshwater ecosystem}}

[[File:Panorama presa las niñas mogan gran canaria.jpg|thumb|640px|left|Freshwater ecosystem.]]{{clear}}
Freshwater ecosystems cover 0.78% of the Earth's surface and inhabit 0.009% of its total water. They generate nearly 3% of its net primary production.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; Freshwater ecosystems contain 41% of the world's known fish species.&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;{{cite book

There are three basic types of freshwater ecosystems:
*[[Lentic system ecology|Lentic]]: slow moving water, including [[pond|pool]]s, [[pond]]s, and [[lake]]s.
*[[Lotic System Ecology|Lotic]]: faster moving water, for example [[stream]]s and [[river]]s.
*[[Wetland]]s: areas where the soil is saturated or inundated for at least part of the time.&lt;ref name=Vaccari&gt;{{cite book

===Lentic ===
{{see also|Lake ecosystem}}

[[File:Primary zones of a lake.png|thumb|400px|right|The three primary zones of a lake.]]
Lake ecosystems can be divided into zones. One common system divides lakes into three zones (see figure).  The first, the [[littoral zone]], is the shallow zone near the shore. This is where rooted wetland plants occur.  The offshore is divided into two further zones, an open water zone and a deep water zone.  In the open water zone (or photic zone) sunlight supports photosynthetic algae, and the species that feed upon them.  In the deep water zone, sunlight is not available and the food web is based on detritus entering from the littoral and photic zones.  Some systems use other names.  The off shore areas may be called the [[pelagic zone]], the [[photic zone]] may be called the [[limnetic zone]] and the [[aphotic zone]] may be called the [[profundal zone]]. Inland from the littoral zone one can also frequently identify a [[riparian zone]] which has plants still affected by the presence of the lake—this can include effects from windfalls, spring flooding, and winter ice damage. The production of the lake as a whole is the result of production from plants growing in the littoral zone, combined with production from plankton growing in the open water.

[[Wetland]]s can be part of the lentic system, as they form naturally along most lake shores, the width of the wetland and littoral zone being dependent upon the slope of the shoreline and the amount of natural change in water levels, within and among years. Often dead trees accumulate in this zone, either from windfalls on the shore or logs transported to the site during floods.  This woody debris provides important habitat for fish and nesting birds, as well as protecting shorelines from erosion.

Two important subclasses of lakes are [[pond]]s, which typically are small lakes that intergrade with wetlands, and water [[reservoir]]s. Over long periods of time, lakes, or bays within them, may gradually become enriched by nutrients and slowly fill in with organic sediments, a process called succession. When humans use the watershed, the volumes of sediment entering the lake can accelerate this process. The addition of sediments and nutrients to a lake is known as [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

====Ponds====

Ponds are small bodies of freshwater with shallow and still water, [[marsh]], and [[aquatic plants]].&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, J. (1986). Observer's Book of Pond Life. Frederick Warne, London. 460 p.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be further divided into four zones: vegetation zone, open water, bottom mud and surface film.&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, J. (1986). Observer's Book of Pond Life. Frederick Warne, London. 460 p. p.160-163.&lt;/ref&gt; The size and depth of ponds often varies greatly with the time of year; many ponds are produced by spring flooding from rivers. [[Food web]]s are based both on free-floating [[algae]] and upon aquatic plants. There is usually a diverse array of aquatic life, with a few examples including algae, snails, fish, beetles, water bugs, frogs, turtles, otters and muskrats. Top predators may include large fish, herons, or alligators.  Since fish are a major predator upon amphibian larvae, ponds that dry up each year, thereby killing resident fish, provide important refugia for amphibian breeding.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; Ponds that dry up completely each year are often known as [[vernal pools]]. Some ponds are produced by animal activity, including alligator holes and beaver ponds, and these add important diversity to landscapes.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;

===Lotic ===
{{see also|River ecosystem}}

The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]], which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into [[upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|upland and lowland]] rivers.  The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] derive the majority of their food base from algae. [[Fish migration|Anadromous fish]] are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and [[introduced species]].&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed.  The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.&lt;ref name= Keddy/&gt;

===Wetlands ===
Wetlands are dominated by [[vascular plant]]s that have adapted to saturated soil.&lt;ref name=Keddy&gt;{{cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|title=Wetland Ecology. Principles and Conservation.|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51940-3|page=497}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main types of wetlands: swamp, marsh, fen and bog (both fens and bogs are types of [[mire]]). Wetlands are the most productive natural ecosystems in the world because of the proximity of water and soil. Hence they support large numbers of plant and animal species. Due to their productivity, wetlands are often converted into dry land with [[ditch|dykes]] and [[drainage|drains]] and used for agricultural purposes. The construction of dykes, and dams, has negative consequences for individual wetlands and entire watersheds.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; Their closeness to lakes and rivers means that they are often developed for human settlement.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; Once settlements are constructed and protected by dykes, the settlements then become vulnerable to land subsidence and ever increasing risk of flooding.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;  The Louisiana coast around New Orleans is a well-known example;&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A., D. Campbell, T. McFalls, G. Shaffer, R. Moreau, C. Dranguet, and R. Heleniak.  2007. The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future.  Environmental Reviews 15: 1- 35.&lt;/ref&gt; the Danube Delta in Europe is another.&lt;ref&gt;Gastescu, P. (1993). The Danube Delta: geographical characteristics and ecological recovery. Earth and Environmental Science, 29, 57–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Aquatic ecosystems perform many important environmental functions. For example, they [[biogeochemical cycle|recycle nutrients]], purify water, attenuate floods, recharge ground water and provide habitats for wildlife.&lt;ref name=Loeb&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Loeb
  | first = Stanford L.
  | title = Biological Monitoring of Aquatic Systems
  | publisher = [[CRC Press]]
  | date = 24 January 1994
  | isbn = 0-87371-910-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic ecosystems are also used for human recreation, and are very important to the [[tourism]] industry, especially in coastal regions.&lt;ref name=Daily/&gt;

The health of an aquatic ecosystem is degraded when the ecosystem's ability to absorb a stress has been exceeded. A stress on an aquatic ecosystem can be a result of physical, chemical or biological alterations of the environment. Physical alterations include changes in water temperature, water flow and light availability. Chemical alterations include changes in the loading rates of biostimulatory nutrients, oxygen consuming materials, and toxins. Biological alterations include over-harvesting of commercial species and the introduction of exotic species. Human populations can impose excessive stresses on aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Loeb/&gt; There are many examples of excessive stresses with negative consequences. Consider three. The environmental history of the Great Lakes of North America illustrates this problem, particularly how multiple stresses, such as water pollution, over-harvesting and invasive species can combine.&lt;ref name="Vallentyne, J. R. 1974"&gt;Vallentyne, J. R. (1974). The Algal Bowl: Lakes and Man, Miscellaneous Special Publication No. 22. Ottawa, ON: Department of the Environment, Fisheries and Marine Service.&lt;/ref&gt; The Norfolk Broadlands in England illustrate similar decline with pollution and invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, B. (1983). The Norfolk Broadland: experiments in the restoration of a complex wetland. Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 58, 521–561.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lake Pontchartrain along the Gulf of Mexico illustrates the negative effects of different stresses including levee construction, logging of swamps, invasive species and salt water intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P. A., Campbell, D., McFalls T., Shaffer, G., Moreau, R., Dranguet, C., and Heleniak, R. (2007). The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future. Environmental Reviews, 15, 1–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abiotic characteristics==
An ecosystem is composed of [[Biotic component|biotic]] communities that are structured by biological interactions and [[abiotic]] environmental factors. Some of the important abiotic environmental factors of aquatic ecosystems include substrate type, water depth, nutrient levels, temperature, salinity, and flow.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Loeb/&gt; It is often difficult to determine the relative importance of these factors without rather large experiments.  There may be complicated feedback loops.  For example, sediment may determine the presence of aquatic plants, but aquatic plants may also trap sediment, and add to the sediment through peat.

The amount of dissolved oxygen in a water body is frequently the key substance in determining the extent and kinds of organic life in the water body. Fish need dissolved oxygen to survive, although their tolerance to low oxygen varies among species; in extreme cases of low oxygen some fish even resort to air gulping.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, J. B. (1997). Air Breathing Fishes. San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants often have to produce [[aerenchyma]], while the shape and size of leaves may also be altered.&lt;ref&gt;Sculthorpe, C. D. (1967). The Biology of Aquatic Vascular Plants. Reprinted 1985 Edward Arnold, by London.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, oxygen is fatal to many kinds of [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] bacteria.&lt;ref name=Manahan&gt;{{cite book| last = Manahan| first = Stanley E.| title = Environmental Chemistry| publisher = [[CRC Press]]| date = 1 January 2005| isbn = 1-56670-633-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutrient levels are important in controlling the abundance of many species of algae.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, V. H. (1982). The nitrogen and phosphorus dependence of algal biomass in lakes: an empirical and theoretical analysis. Limnology and Oceanography, 27, 1101–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The relative abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus can in effect determine which species of algae come to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, V. H. (1983). Low nitrogen to phosphorus ratios favor dominance by bluegreen algae in lake phytoplankton. Science, 221, 669–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Algae are a very important source of food for aquatic life, but at the same time, if they become over-abundant, they can cause declines in fish when they decay.&lt;ref name="Vallentyne, J. R. 1974"/&gt; Similar over-abundance of algae in coastal environments such as the Gulf of Mexico produces, upon decay, a hypoxic region of water known as a [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, R. E. and Rabelais, N. N. (2003). Linking landscape and water quality in the Mississippi River Basin for 200 years. BioScience, 53, 563–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The salinity of the water body is also a determining factor in the kinds of species found in the water body. Organisms in marine ecosystems tolerate salinity, while many freshwater organisms are intolerant of salt. The degree of salinity in an estuary or delta is an important control upon the type of [[wetland]] (fresh, intermediate, or brackish), and the associated animal species.  Dams built upstream may reduce spring flooding, and reduce sediment accretion, and may therefore lead to saltwater intrusion in coastal wetlands.&lt;ref name = Keddy/&gt;

Freshwater used for [[irrigation]] purposes often absorbs levels of salt that are harmful to freshwater organisms.&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt;

==Biotic characteristics==
The biotic characteristics are mainly determined by the organisms that occur.  For example, wetland plants may produce dense canopies that cover large areas of sediment—or snails or geese may graze the vegetation leaving large mud flats. Aquatic environments have relatively low oxygen levels, forcing adaptation by the organisms found there.  For example, many wetland plants must produce [[aerenchyma]] to carry oxygen to roots. Other biotic characteristics are more subtle and difficult to measure, such as the relative importance of competition, mutualism or predation.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; There are a growing number of cases where predation by coastal herbivores including snails, geese and mammals appears to be a dominant biotic factor.&lt;ref&gt;Silliman, B. R., Grosholz, E. D., and Bertness, M. D. (eds.) (2009). Human Impacts on Salt Marshes: A Global Perspective. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autotrophic organisms===
[[Autotroph]]ic organisms are producers that generate organic compounds from inorganic material. Algae use solar energy to generate biomass from carbon dioxide and are possibly the most important autotrophic organisms in aquatic environments.&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt; The more shallow the water, the greater the biomass contribution from rooted and floating vascular plants. These two sources combine to produce the extraordinary production of estuaries and wetlands, as this autotrophic biomass is converted into fish, birds, amphibians and other aquatic species.

Chemosynthetic bacteria are found in benthic marine ecosystems. These organisms are able to feed on [[hydrogen sulfide]] in water that comes from [[volcanic vent]]s. Great concentrations of animals that feed on these bacteria are found around volcanic vents. For example, there are [[giant tube worm]]s (''Riftia pachyptila'') 1.5&amp;nbsp;m in length and clams (''[[Calyptogena magnifica]]'') 30&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite book| last = Chapman| first = J.L.|author2=Reiss, M.J.| title = Ecology| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| date = 10 December 1998| isbn = 0-521-58802-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterotrophic organisms===
[[Heterotrophic]] organisms consume autotrophic organisms and use the organic compounds in their bodies as energy sources and as raw materials to create their own [[biomass]].&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt; [[Euryhaline]] organisms are salt tolerant and can survive in marine ecosystems, while [[stenohaline]] or salt intolerant species can only live in freshwater environments.&lt;ref name=USEPA/&gt;

Given a set of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; samples represented by an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional feature vector, the entire dataset can be represented as &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; rows in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; columns (i.e., an &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix). The biclustering algorithm generates biclusters – a subset of rows which exhibit similar behavior across a subset of columns, or vice versa.

== Development ==
Biclustering was originally introduced by J. A. Hartigan in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartigan JA | year = 1972 | title = Direct clustering of a data matrix | url = | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 67 | issue = 337| pages = 123–129 | doi = 10.1080/01621459.1972.10481214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term biclustering was later used by Mirkin. This algorithm was not generalized until 2000 when Y. Cheng and G. M. Church proposed a biclustering algorithm based on variance and applied it to biological gene expression data.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cs597F/Articles/biclustering_of_expression_data.pdf Cheng Y, Church G M. Biclustering of expression data[C]//Ismb. 2000, 8: 93–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Their paper is still the most important literature in the gene expression biclustering field.

In 2001 and 2003, I.S. Dhillon put forward two algorithms applying biclustering to files and words. One version was based on bipartite spectral graph partitioning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=502550  Dhillon I S. Co-clustering documents and words using bipartite spectral graph partitioning&amp;#91;C&amp;#93;//Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining. ACM, 2001: 269–274.]&lt;/ref&gt; The other was based on information theory. Dhillon assumed the loss of [[mutual information]] during biclustering was equal to the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence|Kullback–Leibler-distance]] (KL-distance) between P and Q. P means the distribution of files and feature words before biclustering. Q is the distribution after biclustering. KL-distance is for measuring the difference between two random distributions. KL&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 when the two distributions are the same and KL increases as the difference increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=956764 Dhillon I S, Mallela S, Modha D S. Information-theoretic co-clustering&amp;#91;C&amp;#93;//Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on KKluwer Academic Publishersnowledge discovery and data mining. ACM, 2003: 89–98.]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the aim of the algorithm was to find the minimum KL-distance between P and Q. In 2004, Arindam Banerjee used a weighted-Bregman distance instead of KL-distance to design a biclustering algorithm which was suitable for any kind of matrix, unlike the KL-distance algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1014111 Banerjee A, Dhillon I, Ghosh J, et al. A generalized maximum entropy approach to Bregman co-clustering and matrix approximation&amp;#91;C&amp;#93;//Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining. ACM, 2004: 509–514.]&lt;/ref&gt;

To cluster more than two types of objects, in 2005, Bekkerman expanded the mutual information in Dhillon's theorem from a single pair into multiple pairs.

== Complexity ==

The complexity of the biclustering problem depends on the exact problem formulation, and particularly on the merit function used to evaluate the quality of a given bicluster. However most interesting variants of this problem are [[NP-complete]]. NP-complete have two conditions. In the simple case that there is only element ''a''&lt;sub&gt;(''i'',''j'')&lt;/sub&gt; either 0 or 1 in the binary matrix A, a bicluster is equal to a biclique in the corresponding bipartite graph. The maximum size bicluster is equivalent to maximum edge biclique in bipartite graph.  In the complex case, the element in matrix A is used to compute the quality of a given bicluster and solve the more restricted version of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X03003330 | doi=10.1016/S0166-218X(03)00333-0 | volume=131 | issue=3 | title=The maximum edge biclique problem is NP-complete | year=2003 | journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics | pages=651–654 | vauthors=Peeters R}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires either large [[computer|computational]] effort or the use of lossy [[heuristics]] to short-circuit the calculation.&lt;ref name="madeira-oliveira" /&gt;

Different biclustering algorithms have different definitions of bicluster.&lt;ref name="madeira-oliveira"&gt;

They are:

#Bicluster with constant values (a),
#Bicluster with constant values on rows (b) or columns (c),
#Bicluster with coherent values (d, e).

'''1.Bicluster with constant values'''

When a biclustering algorithm tries to find a constant bicluster, the normal way for it is to reorder the rows and columns of the matrix so it can group together similar rows/columns and find biclusters with similar values. This method is OK when the data is tidy. But as the data can be noisy most of the times, so it can’t satisfy us. More sophisticated methods should be used.
A perfect constant bicluster is a matrix(I,J) where all values a(i,j) are equal to μ. In real data, a(i,j) can be seen as n(i,j) +μ where n(i,j) is the noise. 
According to Hartigan’s algorithm, by splitting the original data matrix into a set of biclusters, variance is used to compute constant biclusters. So, a perfect bicluster is a matrix with variance zero. Also, in order to prevent the partitioning of the data matrix into biclusters with only one row and one column, Hartigan assumes that there are K biclusters within the data matrix. When the data matrix is partitioned into K biclusters, the algorithm ends.

'''2.Biclusters with constant values on rows or columns'''

This kind of biclusters can’t be evaluated just by variance of its values. To finish the identification, the columns and the rows should be normalized at first. There are other algorithms, without normalization step, can find biclusters have rows and columns with different approaches.

'''3.Biclusters with coherent values'''

For biclusters with coherent values on rows and columns, an overall improvement over the algorithms for biclusters with constant values on rows or on columns should be considered. 
That means a sophisticated algorithm is needed. This algorithm may contain analysis of variance between groups, using co-variance between both rows and columns. In Cheng and Church's theorem, a bicluster is defined as a subset of rows and columns with almost the same score. The similarity score is used to measure the coherence of rows and columns.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biclustering algorithms have also been proposed and used in other application fields under the names coclustering, bidimensional clustering, and subspace clustering.&lt;ref name="madeira-oliveira" /&gt;

Given the known importance of discovering local patterns in [[time-series data]], recent proposals have addressed the biclustering problem in the specific case of time series [[gene expression]] data. In this case, the interesting biclusters can be restricted to those with [[wikt:contiguity|contiguous]] columns. This restriction leads to a [[tractable problem]] and enables the development of efficient exhaustive [[enumeration]] algorithms such as CCC-Biclustering &lt;ref name="ccc-biclustering"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
The approximate patterns in CCC-Biclustering algorithms allow a given number of errors, per gene, relatively to an expression profile representing the expression pattern in the bicluster. The e-CCC-Biclustering algorithm uses approximate expressions to find and report all maximal CCC-Biclusters by a discretized matrix A and efficient string processing techniques.

These [[algorithm]]s find and report all maximal biclusters with coherent and contiguous columns with perfect/approximate expression patterns, in time linear/[[polynomial]] which is obtained by manipulating a discretized version of original expression matrix in the size of the time series gene expression [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] using efficient [[string processing]] techniques based on [[suffix tree]]s. These algorithms are also applied to solve problems and sketch the analysis of computational complexity.

Some recent algorithms have attempted to include additional support for biclustering rectangular matrices in the form of other [[datatype]]s, including cMonkey.

There is an ongoing debate about how to judge the results of these methods, as biclustering allows overlap between clusters and some [[algorithms]] allow the exclusion of hard-to-reconcile columns/conditions. Not all of the available algorithms are deterministic and the analyst must pay attention to the degree to which results represent stable [[minima]]. Because this is an [[unsupervised classification]] problem, the lack of a [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] makes it difficult to spot errors in the results. One approach is to utilize multiple biclustering algorithms, with majority or [[super-majority]] voting amongst them deciding the best result. Another way is to analyse the quality of shifting and scaling patterns in biclusters.&lt;ref&gt;

Test clustering can solve the high-dimensional sparse problem, which means clustering text and words at the same time. When clustering text, we need to think about not only the words information, but also the information of words clusters that was composed by words. Then according to similarity of feature words in the text, will eventually cluster the feature words. This is called co-clustering. There are two advantages of co-clustering: one is clustering the test based on words clusters can extremely decrease the dimension of clustering, it can also appropriate to measure the distance between the tests. Second is mining more useful information and can get the corresponding information in test clusters and words clusters. This corresponding information can be used to describe the type of texts and words, at the same time, the result of words clustering can be also used to text mining and information retrieval.

Several approaches have been proposed based on the information contents of the resulting blocks: matrix-based approaches such as [[singular value decomposition|SVD]] and BVD, and graph-based approaches. [[Information-theoretic]] algorithms [[iterative]]ly assign each row to a cluster of documents and each column to a cluster of words such that the mutual information is maximized. Matrix-based methods focus on the decomposition of matrices into blocks such that the error between the original matrix and the regenerated matrices from the decomposition is minimized.  Graph-based methods tend to minimize the cuts between the clusters. Given two groups of documents d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the number of cuts can be measured as the number of words that occur in documents of groups d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

More recently (Bisson and Hussain)&lt;ref name="chi-sim"/&gt; have proposed a new approach of using the similarity between words and the similarity between documents to [[co-clustering|co-cluster]] the matrix. Their method (known as '''χ-Sim''', for cross similarity) is based on finding document-document similarity and word-word similarity, and then using classical clustering methods such as [[hierarchical clustering]]. Instead of explicitly clustering rows and columns alternately, they consider higher-order occurrences of words, inherently taking into account the documents in which they occur. Thus, the similarity between two words is calculated based on the documents in which they occur and also the documents in which "similar" words occur. The idea here is that two documents about the same topic do not necessarily use the same set of words to describe it but a subset of the words and other similar words that are characteristic of that topic. This approach of taking higher-order similarities takes the [[latent semantic analysis|latent semantic]] structure of the whole corpus into consideration with the result of generating a better clustering of the documents and words.

In text databases, for a document collection defined by a document by term D matrix (of size m by n, m: number of documents, n: number of terms) the cover-coefficient based clustering methodology&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author1=Can, F. |author2=Ozkarahan, E. A. | year = 1990

 | volume = 15
 | issue = 4
 | pages = 483–517
 | doi = 10.1145/99935.99938
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; yields the same number of clusters both for documents and terms (words) using a double-stage probability experiment. According to the cover coefficient concept number of clusters can also be roughly estimated by the following formula &lt;math&gt;(m \times n) / t&lt;/math&gt; where t is the number of non-zero entries in D. Note that in D each row and each column must contain at least one non-zero element.

In contrast to other approaches, FABIA is a multiplicative model that assumes realistic [[non-Gaussianity|non-Gaussian]] signal distributions with [[heavy tails]]. FABIA utilizes well understood model selection techniques like variational approaches and applies the [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] framework. The generative framework allows FABIA to determine the [[information content]] of each bicluster to separate spurious biclusters from true biclusters.

The '''cultural turn''' is a movement beginning in the early 1970s among scholars in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] to make [[culture]] the focus of contemporary debates; it also describes a shift in emphasis toward ''meaning'' and away from a [[positivist]] [[epistemology]]. The cultural turn is described in 2005 by [[Lynette Spillman]] and [[Mark D. Jacobs]] as "one of the most influential trends in the humanities and social sciences in the last generation".&lt;ref name="Cultural sociology at the crossroads of the discipline"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=Mark|last2=Spillman|first2=Lynette|title=Cultural sociology at the crossroads of the discipline|journal=Poetics|date=2005|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–14|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X05000045 |deadurl=no |accessdate=25 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.poetic.2005.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent [[historiographer]] argues that the cultural turn involved a "wide array of new theoretical impulses coming from fields formerly peripheral to the social sciences",&lt;ref name="steinmetz1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinmetz|first=G|title=State/Culture: State-Formation after the Cultural Turn|year=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially [[post-structuralism]], cultural studies, literary criticism, and various forms of linguistic analysis, which emphasized "the causal and socially constitutive role of cultural processes and systems of signification".&lt;ref name="steinmetz1"/&gt;

==Background==
The cultural turn in the late 20th century is interpreted as referring to either a substantive shift in society or an analytical shift in academia. The former argues that culture plays a more significant role in advanced societies, which fits with the notion of [[post-modernity]] as an historical era in which people "emphasizes the importance of art and culture for education, moral growth, and social criticism and change".&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steven|first1=Best|title=Culture Turn|journal=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology |date=2007 |doi=10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x |url=http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_yr2013_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-202|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is movement within academia to place the concept of culture, and the related notions of ''meaning'', ''cognition'', ''affect'', and ''symbols'' at the center of methodological and theoretical focus. Some argue that the analytical shift is endogenous to the substantive shift.&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"/&gt;

Culture can be defined as "the social process whereby people communicate meanings, make sense of their world, construct their identities, and define their beliefs and values".&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"/&gt; Or, for [[Georg Simmel]], [[culture]] refers to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". Thus culture can be interpreted on a spectrum from purely individualistic [[solipsism]] to objective forms of social organization and interaction.

==History==

===Analytical shift===
One of the earliest works in which the term "cultural turn" showed up was [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]]'s chapter "The New Theoretical Movement" in [[Neil Smelser]]'s ''Handbook of Sociology'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey|title=Handbook of Sociology|year=1988|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=77–101|editor=Smelser, N. J.|chapter=The New Theoretical Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander, rightly pointed out that the origins of the cultural turn should be traced in the debate of idealism and materialism i.e. Marx and Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Eyerman|first=Ron|title=Jeffrey Alexander and the Cultural Turn in Social Theory|year=2004|publisher=Thesis Eleven&amp;#124;No. 79|pages=25–30|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the labeling of the movement, in the 1970s, "foundational works underlying and facilitating the turn to cultural forms of analysis" emerged: [[Hayden White]]'s ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe]]'' (1973), [[Clifford Geertz]]'s ''The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays'' (1973), [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1977), and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bonnell, V. E.  |author2=Hunt, L.|title=Beyond the Cultural Turn|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the earlier twentieth century experienced a linguistic turn, mostly brought about by the thought of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the cultural turn of the late twentieth century absorbed those criticisms and built on them.

The cultural turn has helped [[cultural studies]] to gain more respect as an academic discipline. With the shift away from [[high culture|high arts]] the discipline has increased its perceived importance and influence on other disciplines.

British historian Heather Jones argues that the [[World War I#Historiography|historiography of the First World War]] has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years.  Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalizion of politics, race, and the male body.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Jones,  "As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography." ''Historical Journal'' (2013) 56#3 pp: 857-878&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive shift===
The cultural turn as an historical era that breaks substantively with the past is only tangentially related to cultural turn as analytical shift. Proponents of the former argue that:

{{quote|“The very sphere of culture itself has expanded, becoming coterminous with market society in such a way that the cultural is no longer limited to its earlier, traditional or experimental forms, but it is consumed throughout daily life itself, in shopping, in professional activities, in the various often televisual forms of leisure, in production for the market and in the consumption of those market products, indeed in the most secret folds and corners of the quotidian. Social space is now completely saturated with the image of culture.”|[[Fredric Jameson]]| 1998, p. 111&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jameson|first=Fredric|title=The Cultural Turn: Selected Writings on the Postmodern, 1983-1998|year=1998|publisher=Verso|location=Brooklyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Advertising]], [[amateur photography]], [[yellow journalism]] and an assortment of other forms of media arose after the politically charged 1960s. Moreover, this media was [[multicultural]], and attempted to target all races, ethnicities and age groups, as opposed to more exclusive media prior to the 1960s. This "[[new media]]" of a [[postmodern]] America brought about an expansion and differentiation of culture, which has only been rapidly expanded by the [[Internet]] and [[social media]].

==In rural studies==
In recent years, there has been something of a resurgence in [[rural studies]], which has become somewhat more mainstream than previously in the academic space of social science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=M|title=Rural geography|date=2005|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing numbers of people have taken on important dualistic questions of society/space, nature/culture structure/agency and self/other from the perspective of rural studies. However, it is the 'cultural turn' in wider social science which has lent both respectability and excitement to the nexus with rurality, particularly with new foci on landscape, otherness and the spatiality of nature. With a conceptual fascination with difference, and a methodological fascination with [[ethnography]], cultural studies have provided a significant [[palimpsest]]ual overlay onto existing landscapes of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cloke|first=P|title=Country backwater to virtual village? Rural studies and 'the cultural turn'|journal=Journal of Rural Studies|date=October 1998|volume=13|issue=4|pages=367–375|doi=10.1016/s0743-0167(97)00053-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Daimyo Clock Museum''' (大名時計博物館) is a small community-run museum in [[Yanaka, Tokyo|Yanaka]] 2-chōme, [[Tokyo]]. The museum was established in 1972 to display [[Japanese clock]]s from the [[Edo period]] collected by Sakujiro (known as "Guro") Kamiguchi (1892–1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2002/09/28/national/clock-museum-shows-passage-of-time/#.W2s7pN_TWf0 |title=Clock Museum Shows Passage of Time |last=Wijers-Hasegawa |first=Yumi |date=28 September 2002 |website=The Japan Times |publisher=The Japan Times|access-date=8 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FlanniganFlannigan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tom Flannigan|author2=Ellen Flannigan|title=Tokyo Museum Guide: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjLRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123|date=17 July 2012|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-1-4629-0424-2|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only museum in Japan exhibiting Japanese clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hellojapan.asia/en/travel-guide/daimyo-clock-museum.html |title=Daimyo Clock Museum |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Hello Japan |publisher=Hello Japan Japan Travel Guide |access-date=17 September 2017 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the Museum collection==
Sakujiro Kamiguchi owned a highly-unusual log cabin shop which sold western clothing. The shop became known locally as "Grotesque", and this was the origin of Kamiguchi's nickname, "Guro". Kamiguchi had many interests, including pottery.  He first became interested in Japanese clocks when he came across an English-made  watch with an attached [[sundial]] in a local shop.&lt;ref name=Judge&gt;{{cite book |last=Judge |first=Thomas |date=November 1985 |title=Daimyo Clock Museum |location=Tokyo |publisher=Daimyo Clock Museum |pages=10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamiguchi realised the unique cultural importance of daimyo clocks: 

:"Because the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa ''shōguns'']] closed the country, a pure Japanese-style clock was created. Like the [[Ukiyo-e|ukiyoe woodblock prints]], the importance of these clocks was recognised abroad, and the clocks have been bought up at cut-rate prices and taken away from the country right up to the time of the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kanto Earthquake]]. Now it won't be long before a Japanese scholar wishing to research the development of these clocks will be reduced to visiting foreign collections."&lt;ref name=Judge /&gt;

In 1951, Kamuguchi established the Kamiguchi Japanese Clock Preservation Society, and gifted his collection to it. After his death in 1970, his son Hitoshi Kamiguchi became President of the Society and opened the museum in April 1972.&lt;ref name=Judge /&gt;

''[[Daimyō]]s'' ('great lords') were the feudal aristocracy of Japan in the [[Edo period]] and they were the only people who could afford expensive timepieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asakusaguide.jp/funky/column02.html |title=The Daimyo Clock Museum |last=Madumarala |first=Sae |website=From Asakusa to Asakusa|publisher=www.asakusaguide.jp |access-date=17 September 2017 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum displays mechanical clocks, sundials and [[incense clock]]s previously owned by daimyo families. There are around 50 pieces on display from the collection's total of some 200 items, in a single 83 square metre room.&lt;ref name=Judge /&gt; The museum's labels are all in Japanese only, though an English-language pamphlet explaining the [[Japanese clock#Traditional Japanese time system|traditional Japanese timekeeping system]] is also available.&lt;ref name="Thompson2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sue Thompson|title=Tokyo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=143W5XbACSsC&amp;pg=PA48|date=February 2007|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=978-1-84537-650-5|pages=48-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13071">The '''economics of science''' aims to understand the impact of [[science]] on the advance of 
[[technology]], to explain the behavior of scientists, and to understand the efficiency or 
inefficiency of scientific institutions and markets.

The importance of the [[economics]] as science is substantially due to the importance of science as a driver of technology and technology as a driver of productivity and growth.  Believing that science matters, economists have attempted to understand the behavior of scientists and the 
operation of scientific institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Diamond, Jr. (2008). "science, economics of," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, Basingstoke and New York: [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. Pre-publication [https://archive.is/20120927155248/http://cba.unomaha.edu/faculty/adiamond/web/diamondpdfs/palgraveeconsci07.pdf cached ccpy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science as a Public Good==
Economists consider “science” as the search and production of knowledge using known starting conditions.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audretsch|first1=David|last2=Bozeman|first2=Barry|last3=Combs|first3=Kathryn|last4=Feldman|first4=Maryann|last5=Link|first5=Albert|last6=Siegel|first6=Donald|last7=Stephan|first7=Paula|last8=Tassey|first8=Gregory|last9=Wessner|first9=Charles|title=The Economics of Science and Technology|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|date=April 2002|volume=27|issue=2|pages=155–203|doi=10.1023/A:1014382532639|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014382532639|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge can be considered a [[public good]], due to the fact that its utility to society is not diminished with additional consumption (non-[[rivalry (economics)|rivalry]]), and once the knowledge is shared with the public it becomes very hard to restrict access to it or use of it (non-[[excludable]]). Traditional public economic theory asserts that competitive markets provide poor incentives for production of a public good because the producers cannot reap the benefits of use of their product, and thus costs will be higher than benefits. Economists have identified several possible reasons as to why producers of science might determine that the private costs they incur in the production process are larger than the benefits that they intend to reap, even though the benefits to society are greater than these costs.&lt;ref name="Callon, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callon|first1=Michel|title=Is Science a Public Good?|journal=Science, Technology, and Human Values|date=October 1, 1994|volume=19|issue=4|pages=395–424|doi=10.1177/016224399401900401|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/016224399401900401|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the technological barriers to production are extremely high, which makes the market very risky. Technological barriers refer to the cost of [[research and development]] of new scientific knowledge, which becomes increasingly expensive as technology continues to play a more prominent role in this type of development.&lt;ref name="von Zedtwitz et al. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Von Zedtwitz|first1=Maximilian|last2=Gassmann|first2=Oliver|title=Market versus Technology Drive in R&amp;D Internationalization: Four different patterns of managing research and development|journal=Research Policy|date=2002|volume=31|issue=4|pages=569–588|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(01)00125-1|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0048733301001251/1-s2.0-S0048733301001251-main.pdf?_tid=3d0f6865-63dc-4427-96c7-296d591248cc&amp;acdnat=1520395953_6c5dc57bf27dfd45501ef8493ca719f7|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, due to the non-excludable nature of scientific knowledge, producers worry that they will be unable to enforce property rights on their produced goods. This will result in others being able to benefit from the scientific knowledge without having to bear the cost of the research and development, which would in turn make the potential return on investment too small to incentivize participation in the market.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; Therefore, science can be understood as the production of a public good, and can be studied within the framework of [[public economics]].&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt;

However, certain economists argue that a non-market mechanism has developed to correct the problem of indefinable property rights, such that scientists are incentivized to produce knowledge in a socially responsible way. Economist Paula Stephen refers to this mechanism as a reward system based primarily on a concept that she calls “priority of discovery.”&lt;ref name="Stephens et al. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephens|first1=Paula|title=The Economics of Science|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|date=September 1996|volume=34|issue=3|pages=1199–1235|jstor=2729500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Merton argues that to goal of scientists is to establish “priority of discovery” by being the first to report a new discovery, which then results in the reward of recognition. The scientific community only bestows this reward on the person who discovers the new piece of knowledge first, and thus this sets up a winner-takes-all type of system that incentivizes producers to participate in the market of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Merton 1957"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert|title=Priorities in Scientific Discover: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science|journal=American Sociological Review|date=December 1957|volume=22|issue=6|pages=635–659|doi=10.2307/2089193|jstor=2089193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen particularly notes that “Compensation in science is generally composed of two parts: one portion is paid regardless of the individual's success in races, the other is priority-based and reflects the value of the winner's contribution to science.”&lt;ref name="Stephens et al. 1996" /&gt; The first part that Stephens identifies corresponds to the salary that a professor in academia would expect to make over the course of his or her career; these salaries are notoriously flat, with one study noting that a full professor can expect to make only 70% more than a newly hired assistant professor.&lt;ref name="Ehrenberg 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehrenberg|first1=Ronald|title=Academic Labor Supply|journal=Economic Challenges in Higher Education|date=1991|pages=141–258|url=https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1650&amp;context=articles|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stephen argues that the second part of compensation, that which is reaped when a scientist establishes priority of discovery, then the earnings profile becomes much less flat as the scientist gains prestige, journalistic citations, paid speaking invitations, and other such rewards. However, she notes that this theory had yet to be empirically tested at the time of writing.&lt;ref name="Stephens et al. 1996" /&gt; Furthermore, her analysis only applies to the world of academia, whereas industry is also a major source of scientific knowledge production.

==Government Interventions==

The field of [[public economics]] posits that should [[market failures]] occur, the government might be able to intervene to correct these market failures. When speaking about the production of scientific knowledge, the government has several options for intervening in the market to attempt to correct the failure. In the United States, two of the most historically popular and most extensively studied options are the [[patent]] system and [[tax incentives]].&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt;

===The Patent System===
[[File:Patent System - Economics of Science.png|thumb|Graphical representation of the effect of patents on production of scientific knowledge]]In the United States, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|Patent and Trademark Office]] issues patents that give the holder of the patent exclusive, defined property rights to their product for 20 years. From an economic perspective, the value of the patent is that it increases the marginal benefit of the firm that is producing the scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; To graphically display this concept, the accompanying figure depicts the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves of a firm in the market for science. The vertical axis displays the [[marginal cost]] and [[marginal benefit]] of each additional dollar spent on research and development. The horizontal access displays the amount of money spent on research and development in total. Research and development is assumed to have [[diminishing returns]]. For simplicity’s sake, all curves are assumed to be linear, and the marginal cost curve is assumed to be constant. A firm will maximize their profits by producing where marginal cost intersects marginal benefit. In the absence of any [[government intervention]], the firm will produce where at RD&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where private marginal benefit (MB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) intersects MC. However, if scientific knowledge is assumed to be a public good, then RD&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is too low a quantity to satisfy the social need. The optimal amount of R&amp;D is at RD&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The value of the introduction of the patent system is that it allows the marginal benefit curve for the firm to shift upward to MB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; so that the private benefit to the firm now produces the socially optimal quantity. The additional revenue is collected from society, as society now pays higher prices for the knowledge given the monopoly power of the producing firm.

In practice, patent law has been correlated with increased R&amp;D expenditure, indicating that this form of government intervention is in fact incentivizing production.&lt;ref name="Acs et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acs|first1=Zoltan|last2=Audretsch|first2=David|title=Patents as a Measure of Innovative Activity|journal=Kyklos|date=August 1989|volume=42|issue=2|pages=171–180|doi=10.1111/j.1467-435.1989.tb00186.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6435.1989.tb00186.x/abstract|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this type of government intervention does not allow particularly precise targeting of the optimal level of R&amp;D production, and several economists argue that the benefit of 20 years of monopoly power is too high.&lt;ref name="Acs et al" /&gt; This argument has particular relevance to current debates regarding the production of life-saving pharmaceuticals.

===Tax Incentives===
[[File:Tax Incentive - Economics of Science.png|thumb|Graphical representation of the effect of tax incentives on production of scientific knowledge]]In 1954, the Internal Revenue Service incorporated an exemption for research costs such that firms could have research costs deducted from their yearly taxes.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; From an economic perspective, the value of the tax incentive is that it decreases the marginal cost of the firm that is producing the scientific knowledge. To graphically display this concept, the accompanying figure depicts the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves of a firm in the market for science. The vertical axis displays the marginal cost and benefit of each additional dollar spent on research and development. The horizontal access displays the amount of money spent on research and development in total. Research and development is assumed to have diminishing rate of return. For simplicity’s sake, all curves are assumed to be linear, and the marginal cost curve is assumed to be constant. A firm will maximize their profits by producing where marginal cost intersects marginal benefit. In the absence of any government intervention, the firm will produce where at RD0, where private marginal benefit (PMB0) intersects MC. However, if scientific knowledge is assumed to be a public good, then RD0 is too low a quantity to satisfy the social need. The optimal amount of R&amp;D is at RD1, which is where the marginal cost curve intersects the social marginal benefit (not depicted on this graph). The value of the tax incentive is that it allows the marginal cost curve for the firm to shift downward so that the private cost to the firm now produces the socially optimal quantity. The rest of the cost is now borne by society, in the form of the lost tax revenue.

Tax incentives allow slightly more precise targeting than the patent system. However, the concern still remains that tax incentives exacerbate inequality by producing financial windfalls for firms that might already be very prosperous.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; Furthermore, empirical studies have been limited, although a 1996 report from the Congressional Office of Technological Assessment found that for every dollar lost in tax revenue, there was a dollar increasing in private R&amp;D spending.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt;

'''Explorer 3''' (international designation '''1958 Gamma''') was an artificial [[satellite]] of the [[Earth]], nearly identical to the first [[United States]] artificial satellite [[Explorer 1]] in its design and mission. It was the second successful launch in the [[Explorer program]].

==Mission==
The satellite was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[Florida]] at 17:31:00 UTC on March 26, 1958, by the [[Juno I]] vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/explorer-3/|title=About the Mission|publisher=JPL|access-date=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The Juno I had its origins in the United States Army's [[Project Orbiter]] in 1954. The project was canceled in 1955, however, when the decision was made to proceed with [[Project Vanguard]].

Following the launch of the Soviet [[Sputnik 1]] on October 4, 1957, [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) was directed to proceed with the launching of a satellite using the Jupiter-C, which had already been flight-tested in nose-cone re-entry tests for the [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter IRBM]] ([[intermediate-range ballistic missile]]). Working closely together, ABMA and JPL completed the job of modifying the Jupiter-C to the Juno I and building the Explorer I in 84 days.

==Spacecraft design==
[[File:Explorer 3 Flight Recorder.jpg|thumb|right|Explorer 3 Flight Recorder]]
Explorer 3 was launched in conjunction with the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) by the U.S. Army (Ordnance) into an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] [[orbit]]. The objective of this spacecraft was a continuation of experiments started with Explorer 1. The [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] consisted of a [[cosmic ray]] counter (a [[Geiger-Müller tube]]), and a [[micrometeoroid|micrometeorite]] detector (a wire grid array and acoustic detector). The Explorer 3 spacecraft was [[spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]] and had an on-board [[tape recorder]] to provide a complete [[radiation]] history for each orbit. It was discovered soon after launch that the satellite was in a tumbling motion with a period of about 7 seconds. Explorer 3 [[orbital decay|decay]]ed from orbit on June 27, 1958, after 93 days of operation.

==Mission results==
The discovery of the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] by the Explorer satellites was considered to be one of the outstanding discoveries of the IGY.

Explorer 3 was placed in an orbit with a perigee of 186 kilometers and an apogee of 2799 kilometers having a period of 115.7 minutes. Its total weight was 14.1 kilograms, of which 8.4&amp;nbsp;kg was instrumentation. The instrument section at the front end of the satellite and the empty scaled-down [[MGM-29 Sergeant|fourth-stage rocket casing]] orbited as a single unit, spinning around its long axis at 750 revolutions per minute.

Instrumentation consisted of a [[cosmic ray]] detection package and a ring of micrometeorite erosion gauges. The Explorer 3 spacecraft was [[spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]] and had an on-board [[tape recorder]] to provide a complete [[radiation]] history for each orbit. Data from these instruments was transmitted to the ground by a 60 milliwatt transmitter operating on 108.03 [[hertz|MHz]] and a 10 milliwatt transmitter operating on 108.00&amp;nbsp;MHz.

Transmitting [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] consisted of two [[fiberglass]] slot antennas in the body of the satellite itself. The four flexible whip antennas of Explorer 1 were removed from the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19650073999|title=Vehicle Motions as Inferred from Radio-signal- Strength Records |author=Pilkington, W. C. |date=September 5, 1958 |publisher=JPL|access-date=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The external skin of the instrument section was painted in alternate strips of white and dark green to provide passive temperature control of the satellite. The proportions of the light and dark strips were determined by studies of shadow-sunlight intervals based on firing time, [[trajectory]], orbit, and [[inclination]].

Electrical power was provided by Mallory type RM Mercury cells that made up approximately 40 percent of the payload weight. These provided power that operated the high power transmitter for 31 days and the low-power transmitter for 105 days.

Because of the limited space available and the requirements for low weight, the Explorer 3 instrumentation was designed and built with simplicity and high reliability in mind. It was completely successful.

Explorer 3 [[orbital decay|decayed]] from orbit on June 27, 1958, after 93 days of operation.

A replica of the spacecraft is currently located in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]], Milestones of Flight Gallery.

'''Gauge vector–tensor gravity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Exirifard|first=Qasem|title=GravitoMagnetic force in modified Newtonian dynamics|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|date=27 August 2013|volume=2013|issue=08|pages=046–046|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2013/08/046|arxiv=1107.2109|bibcode=2013JCAP...08..046E}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''GVT''') is a relativistic generalization of [[Mordehai Milgrom]]'s [[modified Newtonian dynamics]] (MOND) paradigm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milgrom|first=M.|title=A modification of the Newtonian dynamics as a possible alternative to the hidden mass hypothesis|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1 July 1983|volume=270|pages=365|doi=10.1086/161130|bibcode=1983ApJ...270..365M}}&lt;/ref&gt; where gauge fields cause the MOND behavior. The former covariant realizations of MOND such as the Bekenestein's [[tensor–vector–scalar gravity]] and the Moffat's [[scalar–tensor–vector gravity]] attribute MONDian behavior to some scalar fields.  GVT is the first example wherein the MONDian behavior is mapped to the gauge vector fields.
The main features of GVT can be summarized as follows:
* As it is derived from the [[action principle]], GVT respects [[conservation laws]];
* In the [[weak-field approximation]] of the spherically symmetric, static solution, GVT reproduces the MOND acceleration formula;
* It can accommodate [[gravitational lens]]ing.
* It is in total agreement with the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] in the strong and Newtonian gravities.
Its dynamical degrees of freedom are:
* Two [[gauge field]]s:  &lt;math&gt;B_{\mu}, \widetilde{B}_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;;
* A metric, &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Details==

The physical geometry, as seen by particles, represents the [[Finsler geometry]]–Randers type:

:&lt;math&gt;ds = \sqrt{-g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu} + \left (B_\mu + \widetilde{B}_\mu \right ) dx^\mu&lt;/math&gt; 

This implies that the orbit of a particle with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; can be derived from the following effective action:

:&lt;math&gt;S= m \int d\tau \left (\frac{1}{2}  \dot{x}^\mu \dot{x}^\nu  g_{\mu\nu}+ \left (B_\mu+\widetilde{B}_\mu \right ) \dot{x}^\mu  \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

The geometrical quantities are Riemannian. GVT, thus, is a bi-geometric gravity. 

===Action===
The metric's action coincides to that of the Einstein–Hilbert gravity:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{\text{Grav}} = \frac{1}{16 \pi G} \int d^4 x  \, \sqrt{-g} R&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci scalar constructed out from the metric. The action of the gauge fields follow:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
S_{B}  &amp;= -\frac{1}{16 \pi G\kappa \ell^2} \int d^4x \sqrt{- g}\, L \left (\frac{\ell^2}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu} \right ) \\
S_{\widetilde{B}}  &amp;= -\frac{1}{16 \pi G\widetilde{\kappa} \widetilde{\ell}^2} \int d^4x \sqrt{- g}\, L \left (\frac{\widetilde{\ell}^2}{4} \widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu} \right ) 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

where L has the following [[MOND]] asymptotic behaviors

:&lt;math&gt; L(x) =  \begin{cases} x &amp;  x \gg 1 \\ \frac{2}{3}|x|^{\frac{3}{2}} &amp; x \leqslant 1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\kappa, \widetilde{\kappa}&lt;/math&gt; represent the coupling constants of the theory while &lt;math&gt;\ell, \widetilde{\ell}&lt;/math&gt; are the parameters of the theory and &lt;math&gt;\ell &lt; \widetilde{\ell}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Coupling to the matter===
Metric couples to the energy-momentum tensor. The matter current is the source field of both gauge fields. The matter current is

:&lt;math&gt;J^\mu = \rho u^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density and &lt;math&gt;u^\mu&lt;/math&gt; represents the four velocity.

==Regimes of the GVT theory==
GVT accommodates the Newtonian and MOND regime of gravity; but it admits the post-MONDian regime. 
===Strong and Newtonian regimes===
The strong and Newtonian regime of the theory is defined to be where holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L \left (\frac{\ell^2}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu} \right ) &amp;= \frac{\ell^2}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu}\\
L \left (\frac{\widetilde{\ell}^2}{4} \widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu} \right ) &amp;= \frac{\widetilde{\ell}^2}{4} \widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The consistency between the [[gravitoelectromagnetism]] approximation to the GVT theory and that predicted and measured by the [[Einstein–Hilbert gravity]] demands that 

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa + \widetilde{\kappa} =0&lt;/math&gt;

which results in 
 
:&lt;math&gt;B_\mu+\widetilde{B}_\mu = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

So the theory coincides to the Einstein–Hilbert gravity in its Newtonian and strong regimes.

===MOND regime===
The MOND regime of the theory is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L \left (\frac{\ell^2}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu} \right ) &amp;= \left|\frac{\ell^2}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu}\right|^\frac{3}{2}\\
L \left (\frac{\widetilde{\ell}^2}{4} \widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu} \right ) &amp;= \frac{\widetilde{\ell}^2}{4} \widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So the action for the &lt;math&gt;B_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; field becomes aquadratic. For the static mass distribution, the theory then converts to the AQUAL model of gravity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bekenstein| first=J.|author2=Milgrom, M.|title=Does the missing mass problem signal the breakdown of Newtonian gravity?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1 November 1984| volume=286 |pages=7 |doi=10.1086/162570|bibcode=1984ApJ...286....7B}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the critical acceleration of

:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = \frac{4\sqrt{2}\kappa c^2}{\ell}&lt;/math&gt;

So the GVT theory is capable of reproducing the flat rotational velocity curves of galaxies. The current observations do not fix &lt;math&gt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt; which is supposedly of order one.  
  
===Post-MONDian regime=== 
The post-MONDian regime of the theory is defined where both of the actions of the &lt;math&gt;B_{\mu}, \widetilde{B}_\mu &lt;/math&gt; are aquadratic. The MOND type behavior is suppressed in this regime due to the contribution of the second gauge field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4482">'''The Hydraulics Research Station (HRS)''' was created by the UK [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Hydraulics Research in Great Britain: Work of the Hydraulics Research Organization Allen, F. H. Nature, Volume 178, Issue 4546, pp. 1322-1323 (1956)&lt;/ref&gt; The Research Station was based in [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], near Oxford. It was established to deal with “looser boundary” problems such as coastal erosion, flood protection and the silting and scouring of rivers, estuaries and harbours. The Hydraulics Research Station was housed at [[Howbery Park]] as a government establishment until 1982, when it was privatised from the Department of the Environment (DoE) to become Hydraulics Research Station Limited.  It is now known as [http://www.hrwallingford.co.uk HR Wallingford].  During its existence, HRS contributed to advance hydraulics research. It also worked on water-related projects in the UK and around the world.

==Brief history==
'''1945''' - The Institution of Civil Engineers submitted a proposal to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research on the need for a hydraulics research station in the UK.

'''1947''' – DSIR Hydraulic Research Organisation formed in London

'''1951''' – Hydraulics Research Station established in Wallingford

'''1965''' – Re-organisation into Ministry of Technology. Hydrological Research Unit transferred to the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] and later to become Institute of Hydrology and then [[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]]

'''1971''' – Transfer to the Department of the Environment (DoE)

'''1982''' – Privatisation to create Hydraulics Research Station Limited - a company limited by guarantee.

'''1983''' – Hydraulics Research Limited

'''1991''' - HR Wallingford Limited

==Major projects in the UK==
=== Thames Estuary ===
HRS started doing research in the tidal [[Thames Estuary]] back in 1947. At this time HRO (Hydraulic Research Organisation) was based at the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington and had links with a large physical model set up by the Port of London Authority (PLA) in one of their disused warehouses on the Surrey Docks.  This model was used to examine many hydrodynamic, sediment, water quality and morphological issues related to the Thames Estuary and the potential redevelopment of the Estuary following the considerable infrastructure damage that had been suffered during [[World War II]]. Many of the issues examined and the techniques developed in this pre-computer age formed a remarkably good base from which the modern range and scope of studies have been developed. This has determined the framework for an understanding of the many processes that operate within the tidal Thames Estuary.
&lt;ref&gt;Inglish CC, Allen FH, The regimen of the Thames Estuary as currents, salinities and river flows, Proc I.C.E, 7,827, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thames Barrier===
The [[Thames barrier]] was designed by Rendel, Palmer and Tritton for the Greater London Council and tested at Hydraulics Research Station.

==HRS and Institute of Hydrology -1965==
HRS established the Hydrological Research Unit for the purpose of River catchment research and engineering and co-operation with other government offices such as the :
- Soil Survey of England and Wales (JP Bell)
- the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food,
- the River Authority (1963 Act).

The work expanded greatly after the 1968 flood in Somerset from such actions as the Plynlimon Hafren and Gwy forest and grassland catchments of 1965 under the auspices of James McCulloch (civil engineering) and John C Rodda (hydrometerology and catchments), to operate several units Northumberland, Thetford, Plynlimon, and was moved to [[Crowmarsh Gifford]] as the Institute of Hydrology, in part concerning itself with a mass Flood analysis using existing River Authority data (1975). The Institute is now the [[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]], part of the [[Natural Environment Research Council]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1258">In general usage the word '''indigen''' is treated as a variant of the word indigene, meaning a native.

==Usage in botany==
However, it was used in a strictly botanical sense for the first time in 1918 by [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] ((1858–1954) an American horticulturist, botanist and cofounder of the American Society for Horticultural Science) and described as a plant 

&lt;blockquote&gt; " ''of known habitat'' ".&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H. 1918. The indigen and the cultigen. ''Science'' ser. 2, 47:306-308.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt; Later, in 1923, Bailey formally defined the indigen as:

=== Botanical definition ===
&lt;blockquote&gt; " ... ''a species of which we know the nativity, - one that is somewhere recorded as indigenous''. "&lt;/blockquote&gt; The term was coined to contrast with [[cultigen]] which he defined in the 1923 paper as: &lt;blockquote&gt; " ... ''the species, or its equivalent, that has appeared under domestication, – the plant is cultigenous.''"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H. 1923. Various cultigens, and transfers ijuent change (see entry under [[cultigen]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{LHC}}
The '''LHCb''' ('''Large Hadron Collider beauty''') experiment is one of seven particle physics detector experiments collecting data at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]]. LHCb is a specialized [[b-physics]] experiment, designed primarily to measure the parameters of [[CP violation]] in the interactions of b-[[hadron]]s (heavy particles containing a [[bottom quark]]). Such studies can help to explain the [[baryon asymmetry|matter-antimatter asymmetry]] of the Universe. The detector is also able to perform measurements of production cross sections, [[exotic hadron]] spectroscopy, [[charm quark|charm]] physics and [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] physics in the forward region. The LHCb collaboration, who built, operate and analyse data from the experiment, is composed of approximately 1260 people from 74 scientific institutes, representing 16 countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/lhcb_page/collaboration/organization/default.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the spokesperson for the collaboration is Giovanni Passaleva. The experiment is located at point 8 on the LHC tunnel close to [[Ferney-Voltaire]], [[France]] just over the border from [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]]. The (small) [[MoEDAL experiment|MoEDAL]] experiment shares the same cavern.

== Physics goals ==
The experiment has wide physics program covering many important aspects of heavy flavour (both [[beauty (quantum number)|beauty]] and charm), electroweak and [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) physics. Six key measurements have been identified involving B mesons. These are described in a roadmap document&lt;ref&gt;

* Measuring the branching ratio of the rare B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; → μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay.
* Measuring the forward-backward asymmetry of the muon pair in the [[flavour-changing neutral current]] B&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; → K&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay. Such a flavour changing neutral current cannot occur at tree-level in the [[Standard Model]] of Particle Physics, and only occurs through box and loop Feynman diagrams; properties of the decay can be strongly modified by new Physics.
* Measuring the [[CP violation|CP violating]] phase in the decay B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; → J/ψ φ, caused by interference between the decays with and without [[B–Bbar oscillation|B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations]]. This phase is one of the CP observables with the smallest theoretical uncertainty in the [[Standard Model]], and can be significantly modified by new Physics.
* Measuring properties of radiative B decays, i.e. B meson decays with photons in the final states. Specifically, these are again [[flavour-changing neutral current]] decays.
* Tree-level determination of the [[Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix|unitarity triangle]] angle γ.
* Charmless charged two-body B decays.

== The LHCb detector ==
The fact that the two b-hadrons are predominantly produced in the same forward cone is exploited in the layout of the LHCb detector. The LHCb detector is a single arm forward [[spectrometer]] with a polar angular coverage from 10 to 300 [[milliradian]]s (mrad) in the horizontal and 250 mrad in the vertical plane. The [[asymmetry]] between the horizontal and vertical plane is determined by a large [[dipole magnet]] with the main field component in the vertical direction.

=== Subsystems ===
The vertex detector (VELO) is built around the proton interaction region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lhcb-vd.web.cern.ch/lhcb-vd/default.htm], The LHCb VELO (from the VELO group)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/en/Detector/VELO-en.html], VELO Public Pages&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to measure the particle trajectories close to the interaction point in order to precisely separate primary and secondary vertices.

The detector operates at {{convert|7|mm}} from the LHC beam. This implies an enormous flux of particles; The VELO has been designed to withstand integrated fluences of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;p/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year for a period of about three years. The detector operates in [[vacuum]] and is cooled to approximately {{convert|-25|C|F}} using a biphase [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] system. The data of the VELO detector are amplified and read out by the [[Beetle (ASIC)|Beetle ASIC]].

The RICH-1 detector ([[Ring imaging Cherenkov detector]]) is located directly after the vertex detector. It is used for [[particle identification]] of low-[[momentum]] tracks.

The main tracking system is placed before and after the dipole magnet. It is used to [[event reconstruction|reconstruct]] the trajectories of [[electric charge|charged]] particles and to measure their momenta. The tracker consists of three subdetectors:

* The Tracker Turicensis, a silicon strip detector located before the LHCb dipole magnet
* The Outer Tracker. A straw-tube based detector located after the dipole magnet covering the outer part of the detector acceptance
* The Inner Tracker, silicon strip based detector located after the dipole magnet covering the inner part of the detector acceptance
Following the tracking system is RICH-2. It allows the identification of the particle type of high-momentum tracks.

The [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[hadron]]ic [[calorimeter (particle physics)|calorimeters]] provide measurements of the [[energy]] of [[electrons]], [[photons]], and [[hadrons]]. These measurements are used at [[trigger (particle physics)|trigger level]] to identify the particles with large transverse momentum (high-Pt particles).

The muon system is used to identify and [[trigger (particle physics)|trigger]] on [[muons]] in the events.

== Results ==
During the 2011 proton-proton run LHCb recorded a luminosity of 1 fb&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at an energy of 7 TeV. In 2012 about 2 fb&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; was collected at an energy of 8 TeV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/speakersbureau/html/Schematics/Luminosities_Run1.gif|title=Luminosities Run1|accessdate=14 Dec 2017}}, 2012 LHC Luminosity Plots&lt;/ref&gt; These datasets allow the collaboration to carry out the physics program of precision Standard Model tests with many additional measurements. The analysis led to evidence for the [[flavour-changing neutral current]] decay B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; → μ μ.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Li Qinglong''' ({{zh|s=李庆龙|t=李慶龍|p=Lǐ Qìnglóng}}; born August 1962) is a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[aviator|pilot]] selected as part of the [[Shenzhou spacecraft|Shenzhou program]].

==Biography==
Li Qinglong was born in [[Dingyuan County|Dingyuan]], [[Anhui]] province, China. In 1987 he graduated from the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (PLAAF) Missile College and later the PLAAF Flight College. A [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilot in the PLAAF, he had accumulated 1230 flight-hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/international/english/li_qinglong.htm|title=Taikonaut (yuhangyuan) Biography: Li Qinglong|last=Becker|first=Joachim|website=www.spacefacts.de|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/l/liqinglong.html|title=Li Qinglong|last=|first=|date=|website=www.astronautix.com|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1996, he and [[Wu Jie]], started training at the Russian [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonauts Training Center]]. When they returned to China a year later, they acted as the trainers for the first group of astronauts. In January 2003 it was reported by a [[Hong Kong]] [[newspaper]] that Chen Long would make the first manned Shenzhou flight. Then in March 2003 it was reported that Li Qinglong would make the first manned flight. It was thought that "Chen Long" was a misspell of "Qinglong", a fact confirmed by the newspaper a couple of days before the launch of ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'', which was flown by [[Yang Liwei]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2829349.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Science/Nature {{!}} China's first astronaut revealed|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18817">[[File:Liquid Mirror Telescope.jpg|thumb|right|A liquid mirror telescope. In this design, the optical sensors are mounted above the mirror, in a module at its focus, and the motor and bearings that turn the mirror are in the same module as the sensors. The mirror is suspended below.]]

'''Liquid mirror telescopes''' are telescopes with mirrors made with a reflective liquid. The most common liquid used is [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], but other liquids will work as well (for example, [[low melting alloy]]s of [[gallium]]). The liquid and its container are rotated at a constant speed around a vertical axis, which causes the surface of the liquid to assume a [[Parabolic reflector|paraboloidal]] shape, suitable for use as the [[primary mirror]] of a [[reflecting telescope]]. The rotating liquid assumes the [[Parabola|paraboloidal]] shape regardless of the container's shape.  To reduce the amount of liquid metal needed, and thus weight, a rotating mercury mirror uses a container that is as close to the necessary parabolic shape as possible. Liquid mirrors can be a low cost alternative to conventional large [[telescope]]s. Compared to a solid glass mirror that must be cast, ground, and polished, a rotating liquid metal mirror is much less expensive to manufacture.

[[Isaac Newton]] noted that the [[free surface]] of a rotating liquid forms a circular [[paraboloid]] and can therefore be used as a telescope, but he could not actually build one because he had no way to stabilize the speed of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astro.ubc.ca/lmt/lm/&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was further developed by Ernesto Capocci of the Naples Observatory (1850), but it was not until 1872 that [[Henry Skey]] of [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]] constructed the first working laboratory liquid mirror telescope.

Another difficulty is that a liquid metal mirror can only be used in [[zenith telescope]]s, i.e., that look straight [[zenith|up]], so it is not suitable for investigations where the telescope must remain pointing at the same location of [[inertial space]] (a possible exception to this rule may exist for a [[mercury mirror space telescope]], where the effect of Earth's gravity is replaced by [[artificial gravity]], perhaps by rotating the telescope on a very long tether, or propelling it gently forward with rockets). Only a telescope located at the [[North Pole]] or [[South Pole]] would offer a relatively static view of the sky, although the freezing point of mercury and the [[Extreme points of Earth#Remoteness|remoteness]] of the location would need to be considered. A [[South Pole Telescope|very large telescope]] already exists at the South Pole, but the North Pole is located in the Arctic Ocean.

The mercury mirror of the [[Large Zenith Telescope]] in Canada was the largest liquid metal mirror ever built. It had a diameter of six meters, and rotated at a rate of about 8.5 [[revolutions per minute]]. It is now decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://physicsfootnotes.com/footnotes/liquid-mirror-telescopes/ Physics Footnotes: Liquid Mirror Telescopes]&lt;/ref&gt; This mirror was a test, built for $1 million but it was not suitable for astronomy because of the test site's weather. They are now planning to build a larger 8 meter liquid mirror telescope ALPACA for astronomical use &lt;ref&gt;[http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~arlin/arcscopes.pdf ALPACA overview]&lt;/ref&gt; and a larger project called LAMA with 66 individual 6.15 meter telescopes with a total collecting power equal to a 55 meter telescope, resolving power of a 70 meter scope.&lt;ref&gt;Hickson, P. and Lanzetta, K.M., 2004, July.

== Explanation of the equilibrium ==
{{clear}}
[[File:Forces in a Parabolic Dish.svg|frame|right|The force of gravity (red), the buoyancy force (green), and the resultant centripetal force (blue)]]
In the following discussion, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration due to gravity]], &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; represents the angular speed of the liquid's rotation, in radians per second, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of an [[infinitesimal]] parcel of liquid material on the surface of the liquid, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance of the parcel from the axis of rotation, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the parcel above a zero to be defined in the calculation.

The force diagram (shown) represents a snapshot of the forces acting on the parcel, in a non-rotating frame of reference. The direction of each arrow shows the direction of a force, and the length of the arrow shows the force's strength. The red arrow represents the [[weight]] of the parcel, caused by gravity and directed vertically downward. The green arrow shows the [[buoyancy]] force exerted on the parcel by the bulk of the liquid. Since, in equilibrium, the liquid cannot exert a force parallel with its surface, the green arrow must be perpendicular to the surface. The short blue arrow shows the [[net force]] on the parcel. It is the [[vector sum]] of the forces of weight and buoyancy, and acts horizontally toward the axis of rotation. (It must be horizontal, since the parcel has no vertical acceleration.) It is the [[centripetal force]] that constantly accelerates the parcel toward the axis, keeping it in circular motion as the liquid rotates.

The buoyancy force (green arrow) has a vertical component which must equal the weight of the parcel (red arrow), which is &lt;math&gt; mg &lt;/math&gt;, and the horizontal component of the buoyancy force must equal the centripetal force (blue arrow), which is &lt;math&gt; m \omega^2 r &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the green arrow is tilted from the vertical by an angle whose tangent is the quotient of these forces. Since the green arrow is perpendicular to the surface of the liquid, the slope of the surface must be the same quotient of the forces:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d h}{d r}  = \frac{m \omega^2 r}{m g}  &lt;/math&gt;

Cancelling the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;'s, integrating, and setting &lt;math&gt;h=0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt; leads to

:&lt;math&gt; h = \frac{1}{2 g}  \omega^2 r^2&lt;/math&gt;

This is of the form &lt;math&gt;h=kr^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, showing that the surface is, by definition, a [[paraboloid]].

=== Rotation speed and focal length ===

The equation of the paraboloid in terms of its focal length (see [[Parabolic reflector#Theory]]) can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;4fh=r^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the focal length, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; are defined as above.

Dividing this equation by the last one above it eliminates &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and leads to:

:&lt;math&gt;2 f \omega^2 = g&lt;/math&gt;

which relates the angular velocity of the rotation of the liquid to the focal length of the paraboloid that is produced by the rotation. Note that no other variables are involved. The density of the liquid, for example, has no effect on the focal length of the paraboloid. The units must be consistent, e.g. &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; may be in '''metres''', &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in radians per '''second''', and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; in '''metres''' per '''second'''-squared. The angle unit in &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; must be radians.

If we write &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; for the numerical value of the focal length in metres, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; for the numerical value of the rotation speed in [[revolutions per minute]] (RPM).&lt;ref&gt;Thus F and S are dimensionless numbers. 30 RPM = &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt; radians per second&lt;/ref&gt; then on the Earth's surface, where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is approximately 9.81 metres per second-squared, the last equation reduces to the approximation:

:&lt;math&gt; F S^2 \approx 447&lt;/math&gt;

If the focal length is in [[Foot (unit)|feet]], instead of metres, this approximation becomes: FS&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;≈1467. The rotation speed is still in RPM.

== Liquid mirror telescopes ==

=== Conventional land-based liquid mirror telescopes ===

These are made of liquid stored in a [[cylindrical]] container made of a [[composite material]], such as [[Kevlar]]. The cylinder is spun until it reaches a few revolutions per minute. The liquid gradually forms a [[paraboloid]], the shape of a conventional telescopic mirror. The mirror's surface is very precise and small imperfections in the cylinder's shape do not affect it. The amount of mercury used is small, less than a millimeter in thickness.

=== Moon-based liquid mirror telescopes ===

Low temperature [[ionic liquid]]s (below 130 [[kelvin]]s) have been proposed&lt;ref name="Borra 2007"/&gt;
as the fluid base for an extremely large diameter [[spinning liquid mirror]] telescope to be based on the Earth's moon. Low temperature is advantageous in imaging long wave infrared light which is the form of light (extremely [[redshift|red-shifted]]) that arrives from the most distant parts of the visible universe. Such a liquid base would be covered by a thin metallic film that forms the reflective surface.

=== Space-based ring liquid mirror telescopes ===

{{main|Liquid mirror space telescope}}
The [[Liquid mirror space telescope|Rice liquid mirror telescope]] design is similar to conventional liquid mirror telescopes. It will only work in space; but in orbit, gravity will not distort the mirror's shape into a paraboloid. The design features a liquid stored in a flat-bottomed ring-shaped container with raised interior edges. The central focal area would be rectangular, but a secondary rectangular-parabolic mirror would gather the light to a focal point. Otherwise the optics are similar to other optical telescopes. The light gathering power of a Rice telescope is equivalent to approximately the width times the diameter of the ring, minus a percentage based on optics, superstructure design, etc.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

The greatest advantage of a liquid mirror is its small cost, about 1% of a conventional telescope mirror. This cuts down the cost of the entire telescope at least 95%. The [[University of British Columbia]]’s 6 meter [[Large Zenith Telescope]] cost about a fiftieth as much as a conventional telescope with a glass mirror.&lt;ref name="Schilling 2003"/&gt;
The greatest disadvantage is that the mirror can only be pointed straight up. Research is underway to develop telescopes that can be tilted, but currently if a liquid mirror were to tilt out of the [[zenith]], it would lose its shape. Therefore, the mirror’s view changes as the [[Earth]] rotates and objects cannot be physically tracked. An object can be briefly electronically tracked while in the field of view by shifting electrons across the [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] at the same speed as the image moves; this tactic is called [[time delay and integration]] or drift scanning.&lt;ref name="Drift Scanning"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabinowitz|first1=David|title=Drift Scanning (Time-Delay Integration|url=http://nexsci.caltech.edu/workshop/2005/presentations/Rabinowitz.pdf|website=Yale University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics|publisher=Caltech|accessdate=27 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145031/http://nexsci.caltech.edu/workshop/2005/presentations/Rabinowitz.pdf|archivedate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of [[astronomy|astronomical]] research are unaffected by these limitations, such as long-term sky surveys and [[supernova]] searches. Since the [[universe]] is believed to be [[isotropic]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] (this is called the [[Cosmological Principle]]), the investigation of its structure by [[cosmologist]]s can also use telescopes which are highly reduced in their direction of view.

Since mercury metal and its vapor are both [[Mercury poisoning|toxic]] to humans and animals there remains a problem for its use in any telescope where it may affect its users and others in its area. In the Large Zenith Telescope, the mercury mirror and the human operators are housed in separately-ventilated rooms. At its location in the Canadian mountains, the ambient temperature is fairly low, which reduces the rate of evaporation of the mercury. The less toxic metal [[gallium]] may be used instead of mercury but has the disadvantage of high cost. Recently Canadian researchers have proposed the substitution of magnetically deformable liquid mirrors composed of a suspension of [[iron]] and [[silver nanoparticle]]s in [[ethylene glycol]]. In addition to low toxicity and relatively low cost, such a mirror would have the advantage of being easily and rapidly deformable using variations of [[magnetic field strength]].&lt;ref name="ACS 2008"/&gt;

==Gyroscopic effects==
Usually, the mirror of a liquid mirror telescope is rotated around two axes simultaneously. For example, the mirror of a telescope on the surface of the Earth rotates at a speed of a few revolutions per minute about a vertical axis to maintain its parabolic shape, and also at a speed of one revolution per day about the Earth's axis because of the rotation of the Earth. Usually (except if the telescope is located at one of the Earth's poles), the two rotations interact so that, in a frame of reference that is stationary relative to the local surface of the Earth, the mirror experiences a torque about an axis that is perpendicular to both rotation axes, i.e. a horizontal axis aligned east-west. Since the mirror is liquid, it responds to this torque by changing its aim direction. The point in the sky at which the mirror is aimed is not exactly overhead; it is displaced slightly to the north or south. The amount of the displacement depends on the latitude, the rotation speeds, and the parameters of the telescope's design. On the Earth, the displacement is small, typically a few [[arcsecond]]s, which can, nevertheless, be significant in astronomical observations. If the telescope were in space, rotating to produce artificial gravity, the displacement could be much larger, possibly many degrees. This would add complexity to the operation of the telescope.

==List of liquid mirror telescopes==
Various prototypes exist historically. Following a resurgence of interest in the technology in the 1980s, several projects came to fruition.
*UBC/Laval LMT, 2.65 m, 1992
*NASA-LMT, 3 m, 1995-2002
*[[Large Zenith Telescope|LZT]], 6 m, 2003-
*ILMT, 4 m, 2011 test

'''QTV''' (Qualification Test Vehicle) of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[Little Joe II]] rocket was the first test flight in 1963.

==Objectives==
The [[Little Joe II]] '''Qualification Test Vehicle''' was launched on its first flight from [[White Sands Missile Range]], [[New Mexico]], Area # 3. The mission objectives were to prove the Little Joe II rocket's capability as an [[Apollo CSM]] test vehicle and to determine base pressures and heating on the [[rocket]].

==Flight==

Little Joe II QTV was the first flight of the Little Joe II rockets. It was launched from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico on August 28, 1963 from Launch Complex 36, Area number 3.  The [[spacecraft]] consisted of a dummy [[launch escape system]] and a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] command and service module. Most objectives were achieved. The lone failure was a malfunction in the destruct system.

'''Osmotic dehydration''' is an operation used for the partial removal of water from plant tissues by immersion in a [[Tonicity|hyper-tonic]] ([[osmosis|osmotic]]) solution.

==Process==
Water removal anuska 
is based on the natural and non-destructive phenomenon of [[osmosis]] across [[cell membrane]]s. The driving force for the diffusion of water from the tissue into the solution is provided by the higher osmotic pressure of the hyper-tonic solution. The diffusion of water is accompanied by the simultaneous counter diffusion of [[Solution|solutes]] from the osmotic solution into the tissue. Since the cell membrane responsible for osmotic transport is not perfectly selective, solutes present in the cells ([[organic acid]]s, [[reducing sugar]]s, minerals, flavors and pigment compounds) can also be leaked into the osmotic solution, which affects the [[organoleptic]] and nutritional characteristics of the product.

The rate of diffusion of water from any material made up of such tissues depends upon factors such as temperature and concentration of the osmotic solution, the size and geometry of the material, the solution-to-material mass ratio and, to a certain level, [[Agitation (action)|agitation]] of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;Rastogi,N.K., K.S.M.S.Raghavarao and K.Niranjan(2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21376">A '''quasi-experiment''' is an [[empirical]] interventional study used to estimate the [[causal]] impact of an intervention on target population without [[random assignment]]. Quasi-experimental research shares similarities with the traditional [[experimental design]] or [[randomized controlled trial]], but it specifically lacks the element of random assignment to treatment or control. Instead, quasi-experimental designs typically allow the researcher to control the assignment to the treatment condition, but using some criterion other than random assignment (e.g., an eligibility cutoff mark).&lt;ref name="DiNardo"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Dinardo | first1 = J. | chapter = natural experiments and quasi-natural experiments | doi = 10.1057/9780230226203.1162 | title = The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics | pages = 856–859 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-333-78676-5 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the researcher may have control over assignment to treatment.
Quasi-experiments are subject to concerns regarding [[internal validity]], because the treatment and control groups may not be comparable at baseline. With [[random assignment]], study participants have the same chance of being assigned to the intervention group or the comparison group. As a result, differences between groups on both observed and unobserved characteristics would be due to chance, rather than to a systematic factor related to treatment (e.g., illness severity). Randomization itself does not guarantee that groups will be equivalent at baseline. Any change in characteristics post-intervention is likely attributable to the intervention. With quasi-experimental studies, it may not be possible to convincingly demonstrate a causal link between the treatment condition and observed outcomes. This is particularly true if there are [[confounding variables]] that cannot be controlled or accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rossi | first = Peter Henry | authorlink = |author2=Mark W.

==Design==

The first part of creating a quasi-experimental design is to identify the variables. The [[quasi-independent variable]] will be the x-variable, the variable that is manipulated in order to affect a dependent variable. “X” is generally a [[grouping variable]] with different levels. Grouping means two or more groups, such as two groups receiving alternative treatments, or a treatment group and a no-treatment group (which may be given a [[placebo]] - placebos are more frequently used in medical or physiological experiments). The predicted outcome is the [[dependent variable]], which is the y-variable. In a time series analysis, the dependent variable is observed over time for any changes that may take place. Once the variables have been identified and defined, a procedure should then be implemented and group differences should be examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gribbons |first=Barry |last2=Herman |first2=Joan |year=1997 |url=http://pareonline.net/getvn.asp?v=5&amp;n=14 |title=True and quasi-experimental designs |journal=Practical Assessment, Research &amp; Evaluation |volume=5 |issue=14 |pages= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502154016/http://pareonline.net/getvn.asp?v=5&amp;n=14 |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[experiment]] with random assignment, study units have the same chance of being assigned to a given treatment condition. As such, random assignment ensures that both the experimental and control groups are equivalent.  In a quasi-experimental design, assignment to a given treatment condition is based on something other than random assignment. Depending on the type of quasi-experimental design, the researcher might have control over assignment to the treatment condition but use some criteria other than random assignment (e.g., a cutoff score) to determine which participants receive the treatment, or the researcher may have no control over the treatment condition assignment and the criteria used for assignment may be unknown. Factors such as cost, feasibility, political concerns, or convenience may influence how or if participants are assigned to a given treatment conditions, and as such, quasi-experiments are subject to concerns regarding internal validity (i.e., can the results of the experiment be used to make a causal inference?).

Quasi-experiments are also effective because they use the "pre-post testing". This means that there are tests done before any data are collected to see if there are any person confounds or if any participants have certain tendencies. Then the actual experiment is done with post test results recorded. This data can be compared as part of the study or the pre-test data can be included in an explanation for the actual experimental data. Quasi experiments have independent variables that already exist such as age, gender, eye color. These variables can either be continuous (age) or they can be categorical (gender). In short, naturally occurring variables are measured within quasi experiments.&lt;ref name="Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research"&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=G. A. |title=Quasi-Experimental Designs |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry |year=2000 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=794–796 |doi=10.1097/00004583-200006000-00020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of quasi-experimental designs, each with different strengths, weaknesses and applications. These designs include (but are not limited to):&lt;ref name="Shadish2002" /&gt;
*[[Difference in differences]] (pre-post with-without comparison)
*Nonequivalent control groups design
**no-treatment control group designs
**nonequivalent dependent variables designs
**removed treatment group designs
**repeated treatment designs
**reversed treatment nonequivalent control groups designs
**[[Cohort study|cohort designs]]
**post-test only designs
**regression continuity designs
*[[Regression discontinuity design]]
*[[Case-control study|Case-control design]]
**time-series designs
**multiple time series design
**[[interrupted time series design]]
**[[propensity score matching]]
**[[instrumental variables]]
*[[Panel analysis]]

Of all of these designs, the regression discontinuity design comes the closest to the experimental design, as the experimenter maintains control of the treatment assignment and it is known to “yield an unbiased estimate of the treatment effects”.&lt;ref name="Shadish2002" /&gt;{{rp|242}} It does, however, require large numbers of study participants and precise modeling of the functional form between the assignment and the outcome variable, in order to yield the same power as a traditional experimental design.

Though quasi-experiments are sometimes shunned by those who consider themselves to be experimental purists (leading [[Donald T. Campbell]] to coin the term “queasy experiments” for them),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=D. T. |title=Methodology and epistemology for social science: selected papers |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-226-09248-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are exceptionally useful in areas where it is not feasible or desirable to conduct an experiment or randomized control trial.  Such instances include evaluating the impact of public policy changes, educational interventions or large scale health interventions. The primary drawback of quasi-experimental designs is that they cannot eliminate the possibility of confounding bias, which can hinder one’s ability to draw causal inferences. This drawback is often used to discount quasi-experimental results. However, such bias can be controlled for using various statistical techniques such as multiple regression, if one can identify and measure the confounding variable(s). Such techniques can be used to model and partial out the effects of confounding variables techniques, thereby improving the accuracy of the results obtained from quasi-experiments. Moreover, the developing use of [[propensity score matching]] to match participants on variables important to the treatment selection process can also improve the accuracy of quasi-experimental results.
In fact, data derived from quasi-experimental analyses has been shown to closely match experimental data in certain cases, even when different criteria were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=J. Scott|last2=Patnaik|first2=Sandeep|date=2009-06-01|title=Using Quasi-Experimental Data To Develop Empirical Generalizations For Persuasive Advertising|url=https://faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JAR49_2-09023-Armstrong-PatnaikSPMay25.pdf|journal=Journal of Advertising Research|language=en|volume=49|issue=2|pages=170–175|doi=10.2501/s0021849909090230|issn=0021-8499|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817081006/https://faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JAR49_2-09023-Armstrong-PatnaikSPMay25.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, quasi-experiments are a valuable tool, especially for the applied researcher. On their own, quasi-experimental designs do not allow one to make definitive causal inferences; however, they provide necessary and valuable information that cannot be obtained by experimental methods alone. Researchers, especially those interested in investigating applied research questions, should move beyond the traditional experimental design and avail themselves of the possibilities inherent in quasi-experimental designs.&lt;ref name="Shadish2002" /&gt;

== Ethics ==
A [[true experiment]] would, for example, randomly assign children to a scholarship, in order to control for all other variables. Quasi-experiments are commonly used in [[social sciences]], [[public health]], [[education]], and [[policy analysis]], especially when it is not practical or reasonable to randomize study participants to the treatment condition.

As an example, suppose we divide households into two categories: Households in which the parents spank their children, and households in which the parents do not spank their children. We can run a linear regression to determine if there is a positive correlation between parents' spanking and their children's aggressive behavior. However, to simply randomize parents to spank or to not spank their children may not be practical or ethical, because some parents may believe it is morally wrong to spank their children and refuse to participate.

Some authors distinguish between a [[natural experiment]] and a "quasi-experiment".&lt;ref name="DiNardo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shadish2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shadish |last2=Cook |last3=Cambell |year=2002 |title=Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Generalized Causal Inference |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=0-395-61556-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The difference is that in a quasi-experiment the criterion for assignment is selected by the researcher, while in a natural experiment the assignment occurs 'naturally,' without the researcher's intervention.

Quasi-experiments have outcome measures, treatments, and experimental units, but do not use [[random assignment]]. Quasi-experiments are often the design that most people choose over true experiments. The main reason is that they can usually be conducted while true experiments can not always be. Quasi-experiments are interesting because they bring in features from both experimental and non experimental designs. Measured variables can be brought in, as well as manipulated variables. Usually Quasi-experiments are chosen by experimenters because they maximize internal and external validity.&lt;ref name="Quasi Experimentation:Design and analysis issues for field settings"&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeRue|first=Scott|title=A Quasi Experimental Study of After-Event Reviews|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=September 2012|volume=97|issue=5|pages=997–1015|doi=10.1037/a0028244|pmid=22506721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Since quasi-experimental designs are used when [[randomization]] is impractical and/or unethical, they are typically easier to set up than true experimental designs, which require&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otal.umd.edu/hci-rm/cntlexp.html CHARM-Controlled Experiments&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722015648/http://otal.umd.edu/hci-rm/cntlexp.html |date=2012-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[random assignment]] of subjects. Additionally, utilizing quasi-experimental designs minimizes threats to [[ecological validity]] as natural environments do not suffer the same problems of artificiality as compared to a well-controlled laboratory setting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osulb.edu/~msaintg/ppa696/696quasi.htm{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since quasi-experiments are [[natural experiment]]s, findings in one may be applied to other subjects and settings, allowing for some [[generalization]]s to be made about [[population]]. Also, this experimentation method is efficient in [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] research that involves longer time periods which can be followed up in different environments.

Other advantages of quasi experiments include the idea of having any manipulations the experimenter so chooses. In [[natural experiments]], the researchers have to let manipulations occur on their own and have no control over them whatsoever. Also, using self selected groups in quasi experiments also takes away to chance of ethical, conditional, etc. concerns while conducting the study.&lt;ref name="Quasi Experimentation:Design and analysis issues for field settings"/&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Quasi-experimental estimates of impact are subject to contamination by [[confounding]] variables.&lt;ref name="DiNardo"/&gt;  In the example above, a variation in the children's response to spanking is plausibly influenced by factors that cannot be easily measured and controlled, for example the child's intrinsic wildness or the parent's irritability. The lack of random assignment in the quasi-experimental design method may allow studies to be more feasible, but this also poses many challenges for the investigator in terms of internal validity. This deficiency in randomization makes it harder to rule out [[confounding variables]] and introduces new threats to [[internal validity]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynda S. Robson, Harry S. Shannon, Linda M. Goldenhar, Andrew R. Hale (2001)[http://ssmon.chb.kth.se/safebk/Chp_4.pdf Quasi-experimental and experimental designs: more powerful evaluation designs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916072343/http://ssmon.chb.kth.se/safebk/Chp_4.pdf |date=September 16, 2012 }}, Chapter 4 of [http://ssmon.chb.kth.se/safebk/ ''Guide to Evaluating the Effectiveness of Strategies for Preventing Work Injuries: How to show whether a safety intervention really works''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328052718/http://ssmon.chb.kth.se/safebk/ |date=March 28, 2012 }}, Institute for Work &amp; Health, Canada

&lt;/ref&gt; Because randomization is absent, some knowledge about the data can be approximated, but conclusions of [[causal]] relationships are difficult to determine due to a variety of extraneous and confounding variables that exist in a social environment. Moreover, even if these threats to internal validity are assessed, causation still cannot be fully established because the experimenter does not have total control over [[extraneous variables]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/henrichsenl/ResearchMethods/RM_2_09.html Research Methods: Planning: Quasi-Exper. Designs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318182539/http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/henrichsenl/ResearchMethods/RM_2_09.html |date=2013-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disadvantages also include the study groups may provide weaker evidence because of the lack of randomness. Randomness brings a lot of useful information to a study because it broadens results and therefore gives a better representation of the population as a whole. Using unequal groups can also be a threat to internal validity. If groups are not equal, which is sometimes the case in quasi experiments, then the experimenter might not be positive what the causes are for the results.&lt;ref name="Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research"/&gt;

== Internal validity ==

[[Internal validity]] is the approximate truth about inferences regarding cause-effect or causal relationships. This is why validity is important for quasi experiments because they are all about causal relationships. It occurs when the experimenter tries to control all variables that could affect the results of the experiment. Statistical regression, history and the participants are all possible threats to internal validity. The question you would want to ask while trying to keep internal validity high is "Are there any other possible reasons for the outcome besides the reason I want it to be?" If so, then internal validity might not be as strong.&lt;ref name="Quasi Experimentation:Design and analysis issues for field settings"/&gt;

== External validity ==

[[External validity]] is the extent to which results obtained from a study sample can be generalized to the population of interest. When External Validity is high, the generalization is accurate and can represent the outside world from the experiment. External Validity is very important when it comes to statistical research because you want to make sure that you have a correct depiction of the population. When external validity is low, the credibility of your research comes into doubt. Reducing threats to external validity can be done by making sure there is a random sampling of participants and random assignment as well.&lt;ref name="External validity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calder|first=Bobby|title=The Concept of External Validity|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=1982|volume=9|issue=3|pages=240–244|doi=10.1086/208920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design types ==

"[[Person-by-treatment]]" designs are the most common type of quasi experiment design. In this design, the experimenter measures at least one independent variable. Along with measuring one variable, the experimenter will also manipulate a different independent variable. Because there is manipulating and measuring of different independent variables, the research is mostly done in laboratories. An important factor in dealing with person-by-treatment designs are that random assignment will need to be used in order to make sure that the experimenter has complete control over the manipulations that are being done to the study.&lt;ref name="Journal of Personality"/&gt;

An example of this type of design was performed at the University of Notre Dame. The study was conducted to see if being mentored for your job led to increased job satisfaction. The results showed that many people who did have a mentor showed very high job satisfaction. However, the study also showed that those who did not receive the mentor also had a high number of satisfied employees. Seibert concluded that although the workers who had mentors were happy, he could not assume that the reason for it was the mentors themselves because of the numbers of the high number of non-mentored employees that said they were satisfied. This is why prescreening is very important so that you can minimize any flaws in the study before they are seen.&lt;ref name="Vocational Behavior"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seibert|first=Scott|title=The Effectiveness of Facilitated Mentoring A Longitudinal Quasi Experiment|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|year=1999|volume=54|issue=3|pages=483–502|doi=10.1006/jvbe.1998.1676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Natural experiment]]s" are a different type of quasi experiment design used by researchers. It differs from person-by-treatment in a way that there is not a variable that is being manipulated by the experimenter. Instead of controlling at least one variable like the person-by-treatment design, experimenters do not use random assignment and leave the experimental control up to chance. This is where the name "''natural''" experiment comes from. The manipulations occur naturally, and although this may seem like an inaccurate technique, it has actually proven to be useful in many cases. These are the studies done to people who had something sudden happen to them. This could mean good or bad, traumatic or euphoric. An example of this could be studies done on those who have been in a car accident and those who have not. Car accidents occur naturally, so it would not be ethical to stage experiments to traumatize subjects in the study. These naturally occurring events have proven to be useful for studying [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] cases.&lt;ref name="Journal of Personality"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Bruce|title=Quasi &amp; Natural Experiments in Economics|journal=Journal of Business and Economic Statistics|date=April 1995|volume=13|issue=2|pages=151–161|doi=10.1080/07350015.1995.10524589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7927">'''Roundness''' is the measure of how closely the shape of an object approaches that of a mathematically perfect [[circle]]. Roundness applies in [[two-dimensional space|two dimensions]], such as the [[cross section (geometry)|cross sectional]] circles along a [[cylinder|cylindrical]] object such as a [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]] or a [[rolling-element bearing#Cylindrical roller|cylindrical roller for a bearing]]. In [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]], control of a cylinder can also include its fidelity to the longitudinal axis, yielding cylindricity. The analogue of roundness in [[three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] (that is, for [[sphere]]s) is [[sphericity]]. 

Roundness is dominated by the shape's gross features rather than the definition of its edges and corners, or the [[surface roughness]] of a manufactured object. A smooth [[ellipse]] can have low roundness, if its [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] is large. [[Regular polygon]]s increase their roundness with increasing numbers of sides, even though they are still sharp-edged.

In [[geology]] and the study of [[sediment]]s (where three-dimensional particles are most important), [[roundness (geology)|roundness]] is considered to be the measurement of surface roughness and the overall shape is described by sphericity.

== Simple definitions ==
The [[ISO]] definition of roundness is based on the ratio between the [[inscribed circle|inscribed]] and the [[circumscribed circle]]s, i.e. the maximum and minimum sizes for circles that are just sufficient to fit inside and to enclose the shape.&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO]] 1101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Diameter ===
Having a constant [[diameter]], measured at varying angles around the shape, is often considered to be a simple measurement of roundness. This is misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=A guide to the Measurement of Roundness 
  |quote=Diameter is not the same as roundness
  |publisher=[[Taylor-Hobson]] Precision
  |url=http://www.tarkkuustuonti.fi/Kampanjat/Brochure_Roundness_Booklet.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although constant diameter is a [[necessary condition]] for roundness, it is not a [[sufficient condition]] for roundness: shapes exist that have constant diameter but are far from round. Mathematical shapes such as the [[Reuleaux triangle]] and, an everyday example, the [[Fifty pence (British coin)|British 50p coin]] demonstrate this.

=== Radial displacements ===
Roundness does not describe radial displacements of a shape from some notional centre point,{{#tag:ref|Even though many practical roundness-measuring machines are based on such a measurement technique, the data processing afterwards removes the influence of the axis position.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;|group=note}} merely the overall shape.

This is important in manufacturing, such as for [[crankshaft]]s and similar objects, where not only the roundness of a number of [[bearing journal]]s must be measured, but also their alignment on an axis. A bent crankshaft may have perfectly round bearings, yet if one is displaced sideways, the shaft is useless. Such measurements are often performed by the same techniques as for roundness, but also considering the centre position and its relative position along an additional axial direction.

== Calculation in two dimensions ==
A single trace covering the full rotation is made and at each equally spaced angle, &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt;, a measurement, &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, of the radius or distance between the center of rotation and the surface point. A least-squares fit to the data gives the following estimators of the parameters of the circle:&lt;ref name="NIST" &gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/mpc/section3/mpc344.htm Roundness measurements] at [[NIST]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{R} = \frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^N R_i
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{a} = \frac{2}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1}^N R_i \cos{\theta_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{b} = \frac{2}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1}^N R_i \sin{\theta_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

The deviation is then measured as:
&lt;!-- check for accuracy --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{\Delta} = R_i - \hat{R} - \hat{a} \cos{\theta_i} - \hat{b} \sin{\theta_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Roundness measurements==
[[File:RON-Pilot.jpg|thumb|Roundness measurement]]
Roundness measurement is very important in [[metrology]]. It includes measurement of a collection of points.

==Methods==
For this two fundamental methods are followed:

===Intrinsic datum method===
#The round object is placed over a flat plate and the point of contact is taken as the datum point. Again a dial gauge is placed over the round object and the object is rotated keeping the datum at constant position. Thus the error in roundness can be directly known by comparing the peak height as measured by the dial gauge.
#Alternatively a V shaped base can be used instead of a flat plate. Two datum points will exist instead of one since the base is V-shaped. The error in roundness can be measured similar to the previous method.
#Also a cylindrical body can be clamped between two axle centres. Here also the dial gauge is mounted over the cylindrical body and thus the roundness is measured by similar procedure as above.

===Extrinsic datum method===
The intrinsic method is limited to small deformations only. For large deformations extrinsic method has to be followed. In this case the datum is not a point or set of points on the object, but is a separate precision bearing usually on the measuring instrument. The axis of the object or part of the object to be measured is aligned with the axis of the bearing. Then a stylus from the instrument is just made to touch the part to be measured. A touch sensor connected to the tip of the stylus makes sure that the stylus just touches the object. A minimum of three readings are taken and an amplified polar plot is drawn to get the required error.

==Roundness error definitions==
*Least square circle (LSC): It is a circle which separates the roundness profile of an object by separating the sum of total areas of the inside and outside it in equal amounts. The roundness error then can be estimated as the difference between the maximum and minimum distance from this reference circle
*Minimum Zone circle (MZC): Here two circles are used as reference for measuring the roundness error. One circle is drawn outside the roundness profile just as to enclose the whole of it and the other circle is drawn inside the roundness profile so that it just inscribes the profile. Both circles, however, have the same center point. The roundness error here is the difference between the radius of the two circles.
*Minimum circumscribed circle (MCC): It is defined as the smallest circle which encloses whole of the roundness profile. Here the error is the largest deviation from this circle
*Maximum inscribed circle (MIC): It is defined as the largest circle that can be inscribed inside the roundness profile. The roundness error here again is the maximum deviation of the profile from this inscribed circle.

'''STRAT-X''', or '''Strategic-Experimental''', was a [[U.S. government]]-sponsored study conducted during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential future of the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear deterrent force]]. At the time, the [[Soviet Union]] was making significant strides in [[nuclear weapons delivery]], and also constructing [[anti-ballistic missile]] defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential [[missile gap|technological gap]] between the two [[superpower]]s, [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] entrusted the [[Classified information|classified]] STRAT-X study to the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked into more than one hundred different weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the [[MGM-134 Midgetman]] and [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, the {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine}}s, and the [[Trident missile|Trident]] [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s, among others. Journalists have regarded STRAT-X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy.

==Background==
In the mid-1960s, reports received by U.S. intelligence agencies indicated that the Soviets were planning to deploy large numbers of highly accurate and powerful [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs).&lt;ref name=G10_52&gt;Grier 2010, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[R-36 (missile)|R-36]] ICBM entered service.  Possessing the greatest [[throw weight]] of any ICBM ever at {{Convert|8.8|t|lb}}, the R-36 was larger than the most modern ICBMs in the U.S. arsenal at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/icbm/r-36m.htm |title=R-36M / SS-18 SATAN |author= |date=29 July 2000 |work=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |publisher=FAS.org |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its size, it was able to carry high-yield warheads [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|capable of destroying]] [[Minuteman missile|Minuteman]] [[Missile launch facility|hardened silos]] (see [[Counterforce]]). This was considered a significant risk to American ICBMs and, as a result, to the United States' nuclear defense strategy by reducing the United States' [[second strike|ability to retaliate with nuclear weapons if attacked]].{{#tag:ref|"First, increasingly numerous ICBMs posed a threat to America's own weapons."&lt;ref name=G10_52/&gt;|group="N"}}

At the same time, the Soviets were designing and constructing increasingly sophisticated [[anti-ballistic missile]] defense systems to protect strategically important facilities around Moscow,&lt;ref name=G10_52/&gt; reducing the threat posed by American ICBMs. These developments compelled the [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]], to commission a [[Research|study]] to look into ways of improving the survivability of the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear arsenal]].&lt;ref name=G10_52/&gt;{{#tag:ref|"The survivability of U.S. missiles from a Soviet first-strike attack was given particular consideration by the Strat-X participants&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=P&amp;M_184/&gt;|group="N"}}

According to Graham Spinardi in his book ''From Polaris to Trident'' (1994), STRAT-X was a response by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]'s Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering, Lloyd Wilson, to the [[U.S. Air Force]]; the service was demanding a large ICBM called the [[BGM-75 AICBM|WS-120A]]. Spinardi suggests that STRAT-X was allowed to proceed so it could terminate the study for such a missile.&lt;ref&gt;Spinardi 1994, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the WS-120A would not be released by Secretary McNamara, and plans for such a missile were canceled in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-75.html |title=BGM-75 AICBM |first=Andreas |last=Parsch |year=2003 |work=Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles |publisher=Designation-systems.net |accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
The study was named "STRAT-X" in order not to reveal its intentions, and also to eliminate partiality towards [[Nuclear triad|sea-, air- or land-based systems]]. It was conducted by the Research and Engineering Support Division of the independent and non-profit [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA), which had conducted a study in early 1966 titled "Pen-X", upon which STRAT-X was based.&lt;ref name=FAS_ULMS&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/slbm/ssbn_ulms.htm |title=ULMS |author= |date=30 May 1997 |work=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |publisher=FAS.org |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; STRAT-X was chaired by President of the IDA, General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]], while the institution's Fred Payne presided over STRAT-X's "working" panel. The panel also included executives from major independent corporations and [[defense contractor]]s such as [[Boeing]], [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], [[Thiokol]] and [[TRW Inc.|TRW]].&lt;ref name=G10_53&gt;Grier 2010, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Committee members were mostly [[military officers]], including [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Rear Admirals]] George H. Miller and Levering Smith.&lt;ref name=FAS_ULMS/&gt;
{{Quote box|quote="The systems to be analyzed need not be limited to those recommended by the services, and the STRAT-X study group is encouraged to examine system concepts unrestrained by considerations of potential management problems or political influences."|source=&lt;small&gt;Extract from a memo from the [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering|Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] to the IDA&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;|align=left|width=40%}}

On 1 November 1966, McNamara signed an order authorizing STRAT-X, officially initiating the study. During STRAT-X, the working panel was "encouraged to examine system concepts unrestrained by considerations of potential management problems or political influences."&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt; The Secretary wanted new ideas about "path-breaking" weapons systems that were either offensive or [[Self-defense|defensive]] in nature, unhindered by defense bureaucracy, which had the potential to stifle innovation.&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt; Sea-, land- and air-based missile systems were investigated, but [[Strategic bomber|manned bombers]] and orbital systems were not. The group was also asked to consider the cost effectiveness of all systems, as well to predict possible [[Brinkmanship (Cold War)|Soviet responses]]. To meet this requirement, a series of documents were written from the perspective of the [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Soviet Minister of Defense]] General [[Andrei Grechko]], complete with [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalistic]] statements and a prediction of the eventual triumph of [[socialism]].&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP.com/&gt; In the end, a twenty-volume report covered no fewer than 125 different ideas for missile systems, nine of which were reviewed in great detail.&lt;ref name=FAS_ULMS/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2010/01/06/the-strat-x-report-and-its-impact/ |title=The STRAT-X Report and Its Impact |author=Burr, William |date=6 January 2010 |work=[[National Security Archive]] |publisher= |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G10_54&gt;Grier 2010, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Findings and consequences===
[[File:Small ICBM Hard Mobile Launcher USAF.jpg|thumb|A Hard Mobile Launcher that was designed to carry the [[MGM-134 Midgetman]] missile&lt;ref name=G10_54/&gt;|alt=Long vehicle in green black and dirt brown camouflage executing a turn on light-colored paved road for camera.]]

Of the nine prospective weapons systems, five were land-based. These were: "Rock Silo"—a system where missiles would be stored in hardened silos of [[granite]] [[bedrock]] in the [[Western United States|Western]] and [[Northern United States]]; "Soft Silo"—a similar system but with easily   and cheaply constructed silos; "Rock Tunnel"—a system where missiles would be transported around in deep underground networks before emerging at launch points; "Soft Tunnel"—a similar tunnel but built more cheaply and easily; and "Land Mobile"—a [[Transporter erector launcher|truck-based system]] where road-transporters traveled at speeds up to {{Convert|35|mph|km/h}} constantly around a dedicated and winding road system in {{Convert|65,000|sqmi|km2}} of public land.&lt;ref name=G10_55&gt;Grier 2010, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the remaining four, three were sea-based. These were: "Canal-Based"—a systems where missiles would be sailed in canals to confuse Soviet [[Military operation plan|military planners]]; "Ship-Based"—a system where ships carrying missile canisters would travel around the world, hiding among other traffic; and "Submarine-Based"—a system where [[ballistic missile submarine]]s would roam the oceans while carrying missile canisters outside their [[pressure hull]]s.&lt;ref name=G10_54/&gt; The single air-based consideration was the {{anchor|Air Launched ICBM}}"Air Launched ICBM", which required large aircraft carrying [[Standoff (missile)|standoff ballistic missiles]] to launch their payloads at the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=G10_54/&gt;

Despite the numerous options investigated during the study, none were fully implemented. Although the STRAT-X "Land Mobile" option resulted in the [[MGM-134 Midgetman]] and [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] missiles, the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s resulted in the Midgetman being canceled while still a prototype,{{#tag:ref|"The [MGM-134 Midgetman] missile was canceled in 1992, following the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War."&lt;ref name=G10_54/&gt;|group="N"}} while only 50 out of the original 100 Peacekeeper missiles were ever fielded.&lt;ref name=G10_55/&gt; Nevertheless, the study did inspire a number of developments in nuclear weapons delivery systems.&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt; In October 1974, the U.S. Air Force successfully conducted an air launch of a Minuteman missile from a [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5 Galaxy]], demonstrating the credibility of the "Air Launched ICBM" option of STRAT-X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/milestones.asp?dec=1970-1980&amp;sd=01/01/1970&amp;ed=12/31/1989 |title=History Milestones |author= |date= |work=U.S. Air Force |publisher=AF.mil |accessdate=24 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018002131/http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/milestones.asp?dec=1970-1980&amp;sd=01%2F01%2F1970&amp;ed=12%2F31%2F1989 |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the U.S. Navy then had several classes of [[ballistic missile submarine]]s and [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] (SLBM) in service, the study placed a significant emphasis on the survivability of SLBMs.&lt;ref&gt;Clearwater 1996, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the enormous ''Ohio''-class submarine and the Trident SLBMs which the ''Ohio'' class carried. The study originally called for dedicated slow-moving missile-carrying submarines (instead of converted [[SSN (hull classification symbol)|attack submarines]]) to embark missiles outside their hulls and rely primarily on stealth for survivability. However, Admiral [[Hyman Rickover]], director of the [[Naval Reactors]] office, wanted a boat capable of a burst of high speed in order to affect a safe "getaway" after launching the boat's payload. As a result, the ''Ohio'' class was designed to accommodate enormous nuclear reactors to produce the required speed. ''Ohio''-class submarines carry their missiles inside of their hulls, despite STRAT-X's recommendation.&lt;ref name=G10_55/&gt; ''Ohio''-class submarines and Trident missiles are still in service {{asof|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=FBMS/&gt;--&gt;

==Legacy==
STRAT-X had far-reaching effects on the development and deployment of U.S. nuclear forces. It was the first time that the strategic requirements of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]] were addressed in a detailed and analytical manner.&lt;ref name=P&amp;M_184&gt;Polmar and Moore 2004, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2002 report by the [[RAND Corporation]], STRAT-X was described as "one of the most influential analyses ever conducted" for the [[U.S. Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt; Journalist Peter Grier, in his [[Air Force Magazine|''Air Force'' magazine]] article "STRAT-X", described the study as "a wide-ranging look at the future of U.S. weapons that shaped the nuclear triad for decades, and remains a model for such efforts today".&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP.com/&gt; In 2006, the [[Defense Science Board]] (DFS) noted STRAT-X's introduction of ideas and concepts that resulted in the ''Ohio''-class submarines and small and mobile ICBMs.&lt;ref name=G10_52/&gt; The DFS also attributed the use of air-launched [[cruise missile]]s, particularly those carried by the [[B-52 Stratofortress]], to STRAT-X despite their lack of references in the study.&lt;ref name=G10_55/&gt;

'''Science North''' ({{lang-fr|Science Nord}}) is an interactive [[science museum]] in [[Greater Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

The science centre, which is [[Northern Ontario]]'s most popular tourist attraction, consists of two [[snowflake]]-shaped buildings on the southwestern shore of [[Ramsey Lake]], just south of the city's downtown core, and a former [[ice hockey]] arena which includes the complex's entrance and an [[IMAX]] theatre. The snowflake buildings are connected by a rock tunnel, which passes through a billion-year-old [[geologic fault]]. This fault line was not known to be under the complex during the construction of the building in the early 1980s. Where the walkway reaches the larger snowflake, the Vale Cavern [[auditorium]] is frequently used for temporary exhibits, [[press conference]]s, and other gala events by Science North and the wider community.

Inside the main building, a 20-metre [[fin whale]] skeleton recovered from [[Anticosti Island]] hangs from the ceiling.

The complex also features a boat tour, the ''William Ramsey'', which offers touring cruises of the scenic Ramsey Lake. The [[Jim Gordon (politician)|Jim Gordon]] [[Boardwalk]] also extends from the facility to the city's [[Bell Park (Sudbury)|Bell Park]] along the western shore of the lake.

The facility was designed by architect [[Raymond Moriyama]], one of the founding partners of Moriyama &amp; Teshima Architects, based in Toronto.

An agency of the provincial government of Ontario, Science North is overseen by the provincial [[Ministry of Culture (Ontario)|Ministry of Culture]].

==Facilities==

===First level===

* '''IMAX With Laser''' - Science North has a 3D [[IMAX with Laser]] theatre. The theatre opened in 1994, and was converted to 3D in February 2009.
* '''Planetarium''' - In June 2009 Science North added a planetarium. It has an 8-metre dome and 36 seats.
* '''Vale Cavern''' - Wildfires! A Firefighting Adventure in 3D
* '''TD Canada Trust Toddler's Treehouse''' - a children's educational play area

===Second level===

* '''[[Nature Exchange]]''' - visitors collect and research natural items from the wild and are swapped for points in a database. The points can be used to "purchase" other natural artifacts from around the world (i.e.: Rocks, sea shells, fossils, etc.)
* '''Lapidary Lab''' - Visitors learn how to cut, grind and polish rocks to turn them from ordinary stones into works of art.
* '''F. Jean MacLeod Butterfly Gallery''' - A glass-enclosed [[butterfly house]] home to more than 400 butterflies from 30 different tropical species.

===Third level===

The exhibits on the third floor are divided into four main areas:
* '''Northern Forests''' - This area focuses on animals who live in northern forests. Some of the animals ambassadors for the Northern Forest include Drifter and Kashkuanashku (Kash) the beavers, Maple the porcupine and Saunders the skunk. Other notable animals include the Northern Flying Squirrels, the Grey Rat Snake and the Big Brown bats. One of the biggest improvements to the third floor include a nocturnal room, allowing people to see active nocturnal animals during the day  and better equipment habitats for the animals and for visitors. Also, there is an intricate [[bee]] hive, behind a plate glass window, which allows visitors to see into the hive. 

* '''Lakes and Rivers''' - In this area, animals that live in rivers and lakes are featured. The animals ambassadors on this floor include Kash the Beaver, the Common Snapping Turtle, the Northern Water Snakes and local fish found in Northern Ontario Lakes. This sections allow people to get a better understanding of the aquatics systems that surround Northern Ontario and the difficulties and challenges these systems are currently facing. As well, the stream table (also known as the sand table) shows people what is erosion and how erosion can shape the landscape around us.
* '''Wetlands'''  - The wetlands area teaches about the complex wetlands ecosystems. With Lilly creek situated right beside Science North, people are able to go on Lilly Creek tours (weather permitting) and get a personal look of what makes wetland such an important landmass for our ecosystems. Some of the animal ambassadors include Northern Ontario frogs (including Green Frogs, Wood Frogs, Tree Frogs and Bullfrogs), American Toads, The Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake and the [[painted turtle]]. This section also houses the SO2 monitor, which measures the sulphur dioxide levels in Sudbury. There is also an interactive computer that displays the current reading of other sulphur dioxide monitors located throughout the Greater Sudbury region.
* '''Discovery Theatre''' - The discovery theatre is located in the centre of the third and fourth levels of Science North. Here, live science shows cover topics ranging from fire to sound. A daily schedule, located in front of the theatre and on the LCD screens around the Science Centre, is kept up to date and people can schedule their day around the shows they want to see. Usually, upbeat music will be played two minutes before the show starts to allow people to know the show is about to begin. Wheelchair accessibly is offered on the first, and third level of the discovery theater.
* '''The Northern Garden''' - The Northern Garden is located outside of the science centre. This gives people the opportunity to learn about native plant species in Northern Ontario, plant growth and general garden maintenance.

===Fourth level===
* '''BodyZone''' - BodyZone teaches about DNA and how it makes people unique, and how bodies work. There are also many exhibits allowing visitors to measure their performance, such as the race track. The Club Genome object theatre entrance is also in BodyZone.
* '''Racetrack''' - Build a race car and run it on the figure 8 track. This area also features a [[K'Nex]] table, a [[Lego]] play area, and the ball wall.
* '''[[FedNor]] CyberZone''' - The focus of CyberZone is on computer and communications technology. Visitors can mix music at the DJ station, play with green screen technology, and create stop-motion animation movies.
* '''Space Place''' - This lab focuses on astronomy and space exploration. Exhibits include a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} gravity well, a microgravity drop tower, exhibits on [[SNOLAB]], and information on Canadian space exploration. The entrance to the "Between the Stars" object theatre is also found in Space Place. This show explores the topic of dark matter - why we know it exists, and how we are trying to detect it. Between the Stars opened in June 2010 and is designed to appeal to all age ranges with a cartoon character named String Man narrating the story of a topic that is quite complex.
*''' TechLab''' - Technology and engineering area where visitors can create circuits, take apart old electronics, and play with pulleys and gears.

===Object theatres===

Special film and video exhibits which change over time; current exhibits include
* '''The [[Global warming]] Changing Climate Show''' -- narrated by [[Rick Mercer]] and talks about the change in climate. This show was updated and reopened in March 2011.
* '''Club Genome''' -- talks about DNA
* '''Legends of the Great Lakes''' -- This 16-minute show focuses on the bald eagle, the sturgeon, and the woodland caribou. The information is presented as a story that a father tells his daughter before they go to sleep while camping on the shores of Lake Superior.
* '''Between the Stars''' -- This show is on the science of dark matter. It lasts 16 minutes and features holographic technology, creating a 3-D effect. The main themes on the show are an exploration of the evidence for dark matter, what it might be, and how scientists are trying to detect it at [[SNOLAB]].
* ''' Ready, Set, Move!''' -- This fully immersive, active and interactive theatre will take you on a journey into the world of healthy living. Movement-sensing technology allows your own activity to contribute to the story. You will jump, dodge, twist and play throughout the show, your actions helping our heroine Anna and her quest to save her family from an ominous, dark fog.


===Outdoor grounds===

* '''Polaris Boulevard''' - is a line which reaches from a large sundial right up the side of the building which points directly at Polaris (the north star).
* '''Terra''' - Visited stand on this one-millionth scale world model, outdoors near Science North’s main entrance. At sunset and sunrise, the Earth's shadow moves across Canada. The benchmark at the centre of Terra is:  46° 28' 12.00" N and 80° 59' 45.70" W.
*''' a sculpture''' honouring local [[bush plane]] pilot [[Rusty Blakey]].
* '''Lily Creek''' - a marsh located opposite to the centre, Lily Creek is home to many species of creatures.
* '''The Northern Forest''' - This outdoor exhibit features many of the tree species grown in northern Ontario that Domtar relies on for its sawmills and for the manufacture of pulp and paper at the Espanola mill.

==Other activities==

Science North, which was opened in 1984, also owns and operates Sudbury's [[Dynamic Earth]] facility, an earth sciences exhibition which is home to the [[Big Nickel]], one of the city's most famous landmarks. From January 22, 2001 to May 10, 2003, the Big Nickel was temporarily located on the primary Science North grounds while Dynamic Earth was under construction.

The [[Science North Production Team]] produces object theatres, multi-media presentations and large format film productions for science museums and educational facilities around North America.

Science North's former science director, [[Alan Nursall]], is a correspondent for the Canadian science newsmagazine series ''[[Daily Planet (TV series)|Daily Planet]]'', which airs on [[Discovery Channel Canada]] and [[CTV television network|CTV]]. The institution's first science director, [[David Pearson (scientist)|David Pearson]], returned to the position in 2007.

Science North has also worked extensively with the city's [[Laurentian University]] on scientific and environmental research and as a partner in the university's graduate program in [[science communication]].

[[File:SOYUZ.png|thumb|Soyuz family tree: Proposed Soyuz models in white, models that flew in blue and lunar models in green.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}]]
'''Soyuz 7K-OK''' was the first generation of [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft in use from 1967 to 1971.&lt;ref name=Mir&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf|title=Mir Hardware Heritage|last=Portree|first=David|date=March 1995|publisher=NASA|accessdate=24 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5il9QixAg?url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf|archivedate=3 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This first generation was used for the first ferry flights to the [[Salyut programme|Salyut space station program]]; Soyuz spacecraft in their current generation are still in use to ferry crew to and from the [[ISS]].

This generation is notable for the only fatalities of the [[Soyuz programme]] {{As of|{{CURRENTYEAR}}}}, with [[Soyuz 1]] in 1967 (sole crew-member killed by parachute failure) and [[Soyuz 11]] in 1971 (crew killed by depressurization during reentry).

The first unmanned automated docking in the history of spaceflight, between [[Kosmos 186 and Kosmos 188]] in 1967, was achieved with this generation of Soyuz spacecraft. The generation encompasses furthermore the first docking between two manned spacecraft ([[Soyuz 4]] and [[Soyuz 5]]), the longest manned flight involving only one spacecraft (the 18-day flight of [[Soyuz 9]] in 1970) and the first successful manning of the first space station in the history of space flight (Soyuz 11 and [[Salyut 1]] in 1971).

The Soyuz 7K-OK vehicles carried a crew of up to three without [[spacesuit]]s. The craft can be distinguished from those following by their bent [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s and their use of the [[Igla (spacecraft docking system)|Igla]] automatic docking navigation system, which required special radar antennas.

The 7K-OK was primarily intended as a variant of the 7K-LOK (the lunar mission Soyuz) for Earth orbital testing. Mostly the same vehicle, it lacked the larger antenna needed to communicate at lunar distance. The early Soyuz models also sported an external toroidal fuel tank surrounding the engines and meant to store extra propellant for lunar flights, but it was left empty on Soyuz 1-9. After the spacecraft was converted to a space station ferry, the tank was removed.

Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft had a [[SSVP docking system|"probe and drogue"]] [[docking mechanism]] to connect with other spacecraft in orbit, in order to gather engineering data as a preparation for the Soviet space station program. There were two variants of Soyuz 7K-OK: Soyuz 7K-OK(A) featuring an active "probe" docking port, and Soyuz 7K-OK(P) featuring a passive "drogue" docking target. The docking mechanisms of 7K-OK and 7K-LOK did not allow internal transfer (this feature was added on the [[Soyuz 7K-OKS|7K-OKS]] version), thus cosmonauts had to spacewalk between docked modules. This procedure was conducted successfully on the joint [[Soyuz 4]] and [[Soyuz 5]] missions, where [[Aleksei Yeliseyev]] and [[Yevgeny Khrunov]] transferred from their Soyuz 5 to the Soyuz 4 craft.

The first unmanned test of this version was [[Kosmos 133]], launched on November 28, 1966.

==Soyuz 7K-OKS==
{{main|Soyuz 7K-OKS}}
The last two Soyuz space craft of this series were of the designation Soyuz 7K-OKS. In contrast to Soyuz 7K-OK, which docking mechanism lacked a hatch for internal crew transfer, the Soyuz 7K-OKS spacecraft were modified to utilize the new [[SSVP docking system]] that allowed internal crew transfer – this was performed for the first time with the manning of the [[Salyut 1]] space station by Soyuz 11. The SSVP docking adapter is still in use until today at the [[ISS]].

[[Image:Soyuz 7K-T 3-seats drawing.png|thumb|300px|[[Salyut 1]]-type ''Soyuz 7K-T/A9'' for 3 cosmonauts without space suits. This was the Original ''Soyuz 7K-OK'' upgraded for the military [[Almaz]] space stations. The [[SSVP docking system|"probe-and-drogue" docking system]] (left) permitted internal transfer of cosmonauts from the Soyuz to the station.]]
The second generation of the [[Soyuz spacecraft]], the '''Soyuz Ferry''' or '''''Soyuz 7K-T''''', comprised [[Soyuz 12]] through [[Soyuz 40]] (1973-1981). In the wake of the [[Soyuz 11]] tragedy, the spacecraft was redesigned to accommodate two cosmonauts who would wear pressure suits at all times during launch, docking, undocking, and reentry. The place of the third cosmonaut was taken by extra life-support systems. Finally, the 7K-T, being intended purely as a space station ferry, had no solar panels, instead sporting two large whip antennas in their place. As a result, it relied on batteries which only provided enough power for two days of standalone flight. The idea was that the Soyuz would recharge while docked with a Salyut space station, but in the event of a docking or other mission failure (which ended up happening on several occasions), the crew was forced to power off everything except communications and life support systems until they could reenter.

Two test flights of the 7K-T were conducted prior to committing the redesigned Soyuz to a manned mission. Kosmos 496 was launched on June 26, 1972 and spent a week in space, part of it in powered-down mode. Then on September 2, an attempted launch of a Zenit reconnaissance satellite failed to orbit due to a malfunction of the vernier engines on the Blok A stage. The existing stock of Soyuz boosters had to be modified to prevent a recurrence of this failure mode on a manned mission, which delayed the next test until almost a year later when Kosmos 573 launched on June 15, 1973 and spent two days in space. With this done, the way was cleared for the first manned test, Soyuz 12, in September.

In addition, the standalone flights of [[Soyuz 13]], [[Soyuz 16]], [[Soyuz 19]], and [[Soyuz 22]] used a variant of the 7K-T with solar panels, and in the case of 13 and 22, special camera apparatus in place of the docking mechanism. A large [[Orion 1 and Orion 2 Space Observatories|Orion 2]] astrophysical camera for imaging the sky and Earth were used on the former and an MKF-6 Zeiss camera on the latter.

Another modification was the ''Soyuz 7K-T/A9'' used for the flights to the military [[Almaz]] space station. This featured the ability to remote control the space station and a new parachute system and other still classified and unknown changes.

A '''Standard Cost Coding System''' is a system of cost classification that can be used for benchmarking cost and quantities data.  In the Norwegian oil and gas industry, NORSOK Z-014 developed as part of the [[NORSOK]] standards. [[ISO]] is also developing a Standard Cost coding System as an extension of NORSOK Z-014 under ISO 19008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=John|last2=Khan|first2=Mesbah|last3=Partridge|first3=Chris|title=NORSOK Z-014: A 21st Century Update|url=https://www.academia.edu/19712829/NORSOK_Z-014_A_21st_Century_Update}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically a Cost Classification system would be used to classify, activities, resources and product structure.  In NORSOK Z-014, these classification taxonomies are called Standard Activity Breakdown (SAB), Code of Resources (COR) and Physical Breakdown Structure (PBS).&lt;ref name="Ontolog Presenation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.borosolutions.co.uk/solutions/content/files/C5%20-%20ONTOBRAS-2013%20-%20Tutorial%20-%20NORSOK%20SCCS.ppsx/view|title=2013-09 - Tutorial - ONTOBRAS2013 - Case Study 5 - Modernising NORSOK SCCS — boro group|website=www.borosolutions.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sternalis''' '''muscle''' is an [[Human body#Anatomical variations|anatomical variation]] that lies in front of the sternal end of the [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis major]] parallel to the margin of the [[sternum]]. The sternalis muscle may be a variation of the pectoralis major or of the [[Rectus abdominis muscle|rectus abdominis]].

== Structure ==
The sternalis is a [[muscle]] that runs along the anterior aspect of the body of the sternum. It lies superficially and parallel to the sternum. Its origin and insertion are variable. The sternalis muscle often originates from the upper part of the sternum and can display varying insertions such as the [[pectoral fascia]], [[Rib cage|lower ribs]], [[costal cartilage]]s, [[rectus sheath]], aponeurosis of the [[abdominal external oblique muscle]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sternalis muscle: a new crossed subtype, classification, and surgical applications|journal = Annals of Plastic Surgery|date = 2011-12-01|issn = 1536-3708|pmid = 21407048|pages = 646–648|volume = 67|issue = 6|doi = 10.1097/SAP.0b013e31820d688b|first = Athanasios|last = Raikos|first2 = George K.|last2 = Paraskevas|first3 = Faisal|last3 = Yusuf|first4 = Panagiota|last4 = Kordali|first5 = Orestis|last5 = Ioannidis|first6 = Beate|last6 = Brand-Saberi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the clinical significance of the sternalis muscle|journal = Folia Medica|date = 2009-09-01|issn = 0204-8043|pmid = 19957564|pages = 53–56|volume = 51|issue = 3|first = Georgi P.|last = Georgiev|first2 = Lazar|last2 = Jelev|first3 = Vladimir A.|last3 = Ovtscharoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anatomy 2008; 2: 67-71 [Case Report]|url = http://www.anatomy.org.tr/issue/200801/fulltext/case_13.asp|website = www.anatomy.org.tr|accessdate = 2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still a great deal of disagreement about its [[Nerve|innervation]] and its embryonic origin.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In a review,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Case report: bilateral sternalis muscles with a bilateral pectoralis major anomaly|journal = Journal of Anatomy|date = 1998-08-01|issn = 0021-8782|pmc = 1467849|pmid = 9827645|pages = 289–292|volume = 193|issue = Pt 2|doi = 10.1046/j.1469-7580.1998.19320289.x|first = M. N.|last = O'NEILL|first2 = J.|last2 = FOLAN-CURRAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was reported that the muscle was innervated by the external or internal thoracic nerves in 55% of the cases, by the [[intercostal nerves]] in 43% of the cases, while the remaining cases were supplied by both nerves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, innervation by the pectoral nerves has also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sternalis muscle: topic for debate|journal = Clinical Anatomy|date = 2000-01-01|issn = 0897-3806|pmid = 10679858|pages = 138–140|volume = 13|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2353(2000)13:2&lt;138::AID-CA8&gt;3.0.CO;2-4|first = M.

=== Prevalence ===

Cadaveric studies showed that the sternalis muscle has a mean prevalence of around 7.8% in the population&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sternalis muscle, what every anatomist and clinician should know|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ca.22361/abstract|journal = Clinical Anatomy|date = 2014-09-01|issn = 1098-2353|pages = 866–884|volume = 27|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/ca.22361|first = Michael|last = Snosek|first2 = R.

=== Variations ===

A recent study&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; classified the sternalis into three types depending on morphology.
* Type I (single head and single belly)
* Type II (double-headed/multi-headed) 
* Type III (double-bellied/multi-bellied)
Type I, the single head and single belly was seen in the majority of reported cases (58.5%), type II in 18.1%, and type III in 23.4%.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition to the above classification, triple-bellied/double-headed sternalis has also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dudgeon|first=Sarah N.|last2=Marcotte|first2=Kayla M.|last3=Fox|first3=Glenn M.|last4=Alsup|first4=B.

== Function ==
The function of the sternalis muscle remains unknown.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  There are many theories for the physiological function of the sternalis.

== History ==
The sternalis was first reported by Carbolius in 1604 and the name was first given by Turner in 1867.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Turner W (1867) On the musculus sternalis. J Anat Physiol 1(2):246–378&lt;/ref&gt; Different terminologies have been given to the sternalis due to its highly varied morphology and the disagreement on its embryonic origin. The sternalis was referred to as the ''rectus sternalis,'' ''sternalis brutorum, musculus sternalis, episternalis, parasternalis, presternalis, rectus sterni, rectus thoracis, rectus thoracicus superficialis, superficial rectus abdominis, sternalis brutorum, japonicas, and thoracicus'' depending on studies''.''&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

'''Willibald Jentschke''' ([[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]], 6 December 1911 – [[Göttingen]], Germany, 11 March 2002)&lt;ref name = WJCV&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1554142|title = Willibald Jentschke|journal = Physics Today|volume = 56|pages = 62|year = 2003|last1 = Söding|first1 = Paul|last2 = Wagner|first2 = Albrecht|bibcode = 2003PhT....56a..62S }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Austrian-German experimental [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]].

During [[World War II]], he made contributions to the [[German nuclear energy project]].&lt;ref name = WJCV /&gt;

After World War II, he emigrated to the United States to work at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], in [[Ohio]], for the [[Air Force Materiel Command]].
In 1950, he became a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], where he became director of the Cyclotron Laboratory there in 1951.

In 1956, he became a professor of physics at the [[University of Hamburg]] and spearheaded the effort to build the 7.5 GeV electron synchrotron DESY, the foundation of which was in December 1959. He was director of DESY for 10 years. In 1971, he became Director General of [[CERN]] Laboratory I for the next five years. He retired from the University of Hamburg in 1980.

== Education ==

Jentschke studied physics at the [[University of Vienna]], from 1930 to 1936.  He received his doctorate under [[Georg Stetter]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="Hentschel 1996"&gt;Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry of Jentschke.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

From 1937 to 1942, Jentschke was a teaching assistant to Georg Stetter at the [[University of Vienna]]. From 1942 to 1945, he was a lecturer at the University of Vienna. During World War II, Jentschke was also ''{{lang|de|wissenschaftlich Assistent}}'' (Scientific Assistant) at the ''II. Physikalisches Institut der Universität, Wien'' (Second Physics Institute of the [[University of Vienna]]), where Georg Stetter was the director. One of Jentschke's colleagues there was [[Josef Schintlmeister]]. The Institute did research on [[transuranic elements]] and measurement of nuclear constants, in collaboration with the ''Institut für Radiumforschung'' ([[Institute for Radium Research, Vienna|Institute for Radium Research]]) of the ''Österreichischen Adademie der Wissenschaften'' (Austrian Academy of Sciences). This work was done under the [[German nuclear energy project]], also known as the ''Uranverein'' (Uranium Club); see, for example, the publications cited below under ''Internal Reports''.&lt;ref name="Hentschel 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willibald Jentschke and F. Prankl ''Energien und Massen der Urankernbruchstücke'' (August 1940) G-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willibald Jentschke ''Energien und Massen der Urankernbrüchstücke bei Bestrahlung mit schnellen (Rn + Be)-Neutronen'' (16 September 1941) G-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bericht über das II. Physikalische Institut der Wiener Universität'' ([http://www.deutsches-museum.de/archiv/archiv-online/geheimdokumente/forschungszentren/wien-heidelberg-strassburg/taetigkeitsbericht-pi-wien/ 27 June 1945]). See [http://www.deutsches-museum.de/archiv/archiv-online/geheimdokumente/forschungszentren/wien-heidelberg-strassburg/taetigkeitsbericht-pi-wien/dokument-5/ Document 5].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willibald Jentschke and Friedlich Prankl ''Energien und Massen der Urankernbruchstücke bei Bestrahlung mit vorwiegend thermischen Neutronen'', ''Zeitschrift für Physik'' Volume 119, Numbers 11-12, 696-712 (1942). Received 27 June 1942. Jentschke was identified as being at the ''II. Physikalisches Institut der Universität Wien, Wien'' and Prankl was identified as being at the ''Institut für Radiumforschung, Österreich''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and [[Niels Bohr]] proposed the [[liquid-drop model]] of [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref&gt;Niels Bohr and J. A. Wheeler ''Mechanism of nuclear fission'', ''Phys. Rev.'' Volume 56, Issue 5, 426-450 (1939). Institutional citations: Niels Bohr, from the University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, was at The Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, when he collaborated with John Archibald Wheeler, at Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey. Received 28 June 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Their work suggested that [[uranium]] 235 was responsible for thermal neutron fission. This was borne out by the work of [[Eugene T. Booth]], [[John R. Dunning]], A. V. Grosse, and  [[Alfred O. C. Nier]], which was submitted for publication in the spring of 1940.&lt;ref&gt;A. O. Nier, E. T. Booth, J. R. Dunning, and A. V. Grosse ''Nuclear fission of separated uranium isotopes'', ''Phys. Rev.'' Volume 57, Issue 6, 546-546 (1940). Received 3 March 1940. Booth, Dunning, and Grosse were identified as being at Columbia University, New York, New York. Nier was identified as being at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. O. Nier, E. T. Booth, J. R. Dunning, and A. V. Grosse ''Further experiments on fission of separated uranium isotopes'', ''Phys. Rev.'' Volume 57, Issue 8, 748-748 (1940). Received 13 April 1940. Booth, Dunning, and Grosse were identified as being at Columbia University, New York, New York. Nier was identified as being at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. T. Booth, J. R. Dunning, A. V. Grosse, and A. O. Nier ''Neutron Capture by Uranium (238)'', ''Phys. Rev.'' Volume 58, Issue 5, 475 – 476 (1940). Received 13 August 1940. Booth, Dunning, and Grosse were identified as being at Columbia University, New York, New York. Nier was identified as being at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.&lt;/ref&gt; Jentschke, F. Prankl, and F. Hernegger also substantiated the Bohr-Wheeler claims shortly after the American work by observing the phenomenon in an isotope of  [[thorium]], [[Isotopes of thorium|thorium 230]].&lt;ref&gt;Willibald Jentschke, F. Prankl, and F. Hernegger ''Die Spaltung des Ioniums under Neutronenebestrahlung'', ''[[Die Naturwissenschaften]]'' Volume 28, Issue 20, 315-316 (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1946 to 1947, Jentschke was a lecturer at the [[University of Innsbruck]].&lt;ref name="Hentschel 1996" /&gt;

Near the close and after the end of World War II in Europe, the Russians and the Western powers had programs to foster technology transfer and exploit German technical specialists.  For example, the U.S. had [[Operation Paperclip]] &lt;ref&gt;Naimark, 1995, 205-207.  The author also points out that denying scientific and technical personnel to the Soviets was as much an objective as was acquiring their services for the West.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gimbel, 1986, 433-451. The author, in Reference #3 on page 434, points out that the Soviets protested to [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] about U.S. and British removal in June 1945 of equipment, documents, and personnel from regions which were to fall within the Soviet zone of occupation.  [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] investigated and reported that the Soviets were correct about the removals, but what had been done had exceeded their claims.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gimbel, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Russians had trophy brigades advancing with their military forces.  In the area of atomic technology, the U.S. had [[Operation Alsos]] and the Russians had their version.  While operational aspects of the Russian operation were modeled after the trophy brigades, a more refined approach was warranted for the exploitation of German atomic related facilities, intellectual materials, and scientific personnel.  This was rectified with a decree in late 1944 and the formation of specialize exploitation teams in early 1945 under the [[Russian Alsos]], which had broader objectives, which included wholesale relocation of scientific facilities to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Oleynikov, 2000, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jentschke emigrated to the United States under [[Operation Paperclip]], where he worked at the [[Air Force Materiel Command]] (today, the [[Air Force Logistics Command]] after merger with the [[Air Force Systems Command]] in 1992), at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], [[Ohio]], from 1947 to 1948. On his way to the United States, Jentschke wrote to [[Walther Bothe]] that his reasons for going there was to do real scientific work, which then not possible in Austria and Germany.&lt;ref name="Hentschel 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 1993, 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Jentschke became a resident assistant professor, and in 1955 resident professor, in the Department of Physics at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]. In 1951, he became director of the Cyclotron Laboratory there.&lt;ref name="Hentschel 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Willibald Jentschke"&gt;[http://zms.desy.de/aktuelles/vortragsreihen/jentschke_vortraege/biografie/index_ger.html Willibald Jentschke] – Biografi (DESY).&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1956 and 1957, Jentschke was a member of the ''Arbeitskreis Kernphysik'' (Nuclear Physics Working Group) of the ''Fachkommission II "Forschung und Nachwuchs"'' (Commission II "Research and Growth") of the ''Deutschen Atomkommission'' (DAtK, German Atomic Energy Commission). Other members of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in both 1956 and 1957 were: [[Werner Heisenberg]] (chairman), [[Hans Kopfermann]] (vice-chairman), [[Fritz Bopp]], [[Walther Bothe]], [[Wolfgang Gentner]], [[Otto Haxel]], [[Heinz Maier-Leibnitz]], [[Josef Mattauch]], Wolfgang Riezler, [[Wilhelm Walcher]], and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]. [[Wolfgang Paul]] was also a member of the group during 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Horst Kant ''Werner Heisenberg and the German Uranium Project / Otto Hahn and the Declarations of Mainau and Göttingen'', Preprint 203 (Max-Planck Institut für Wissenschaftsgeschichte, [http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P203.PDF 2002]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Jentschke became an ordinarius Professor of Physics at the [[University of Hamburg]]. There, he found a positive climate, as well as funding, for his vision of building a new institute around a particle accelerator. An international particle accelerator conference at [[CERN]] in 1956 was helpful in the decision of which accelerator to build. His vision could not be supported by [[Hamburg]] alone, so negotiations took place to bring in support of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] and the [[states of Germany]] (''Länder''). A financial agreement was signed on 18 December 1959, which founded the ''[[DESY|Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron]]'' (DESY), a 7.5 [[electronvolt|GeV]] electron [[synchrotron]]. Jentschke was chairman of the DESY Board of Directors from 1959 to 1970, and for many years also the director of the Second Institute of Experimental Physics at the University of Hamburg. While at DESY, Jentschke endorsed the electron-positron storage ring scheme for the DORIS accelerator, and promoted the use of [[synchrotron radiation]] for research purposes.&lt;ref name="Hentschel 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Willibald Jentschke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hasylab.desy.de"&gt;''DESY mourns for Professor Dr. Dr. h.c.

In 1971, Jentschke accepted the post as Director General of [[CERN]] Laboratory I (the Meyrin site); [[John Adams (physicist)|John Adams]] was Director General of the neighboring CERN Laboratory II (Prévessin), where the new SPS proton synchrotron was being constructed. They shared the directorship of CERN until the two laboratories were united in 1976. While Director General, Jentschke oversaw the exploitation of the new research tool, the [[Intersecting Storage Rings]], which began operation in 1971.&lt;ref name="Willibald Jentschke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hasylab.desy.de" /&gt;

Jentschke retired from the University of Hamburg in 1980.

'''Workplace listening''' is a type of [[active listening]] that is generally employed in a professional environment. Listening skills are imperative for career success, [[organizational effectiveness]], and worker satisfaction. Workplace listening includes understanding the listening process (i.e. perception, interpretation, evaluation, and action) and its barriers that hamper the flow of that process. Like other skills, there are specific techniques for improving workplace listening effectiveness. Moreover, it is imperative to become aware of the role of [[nonverbal communication]] in communicating in the workplace, as understanding messages wholly entails more than simple verbal messages.

'''''Wszechświat''''' ("The Universe") is a Polish popular-science magazine, currently issued as quarterly by [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]], supported by [[AGH University of Science and Technology]] and [[Polish Academy of Learning]].

== History ==
''Wszechświat'' was founded in 1882&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ptpk.org/czasopisma.html|title= Journals|author= |date= |work= |publisher= Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a biweekly, initiators were students and teachers of The Main School in [[Warsaw]]. First editor-in-chief of the magazine was chemist [[Bronisław Znatowicz]]. He was leading the journal for many years. In 1914, when [[World War I]] began, ''Wszechświat'' was closed and Znatowicz left.&lt;ref name=pwn&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Wielka Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN]]|volume= 12|year= 1969|publisher= [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN]]|location= Warsaw|isbn= |page= 524|accessdate=20 September 2012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine was reactivated as a monthly in 1927. Since 1929 the editor-in-chief was a biologist [[Jan Bohdan Dembowski]]. In 1930, in the result of Dembowski's activity, Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists took mastership over ''Wszechświat'' and in 1934 editorial office was moved to [[Vilnius]]. In 1939 the journal was closed again because of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=pwn /&gt;

It was brought back to life by geologist [[Kazimierz Maślankiewicz]] and zoologist [[Zygmunt Grodziński]] in 1945 in [[Kraków]].&lt;ref name=pwn /&gt; Since 1981 until 2002 the editor-in-chief was pharmacologist and biochemist [[Jerzy Vetulani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.instytucja.pan.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1602:vertulani-jerzy&amp;catid=59:wydzia-v&amp;Itemid=31|title= Jerzy Vetulani Profile|author= |date= |language= Polish|publisher= Polish Academy of Sciences|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays the whole title is 'Wszechświat. Pismo Przyrodnicze' (the English translation: ''The Universe. Magazine of Nature'').

'''Yorks Islands''', also known as "Yorks 8 Islands" or "York's Islands" or simply "York Island(s)" are a group of several islands in the flood plain of the [[Missouri River]], in [[Broadwater County]], [[Montana]], about 4 miles south (up-river) from [[Townsend, Montana]], along [[U.S. Highway 287]].  The islands were named by the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1803–1806) for Clark's servant/slave [[York (explorer)|York]], when the expedition passed this way in 1805 on their historic journey of exploration to the [[Pacific Ocean]].  The islands may be accessed from U.S.287, as a Montana Fishing Access site.

==Naming Yorks Islands==

The islands were named for [[York (explorer)|York]] (ca. 1770-1831), Captain [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]]'s lifelong slave companion, and "body servant" who accompanied Clark on the expedition to the Pacific and back.

The expedition passed this point on 24 July 1805. However, the naming of "Yorks 8 Islands" is not found in the narrative journals of [[Lewis and Clark]] for that day.  Instead it is found in Clark’s tabulations on his map drawings, and in his list of “Creeks and Rivers,”.  Clark's map for this area has the entry, “Yorks 8 Islands,” and under related remarks in Clark's "Creeks and Rivers" is “W.C. on land York tired.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/lewisandclark/inside/york.html "York", part of PBS Site, "Inside the Corps"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507161617/http://www.pbs.org/lewisandclark/inside/york.html |date=2015-05-07 }} PBS, "Inside the Corps", Article on "York"&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday, July 24, 1805 Meriwether Lewis made the following entry in his journal, which describes his thoughts about the formation of Yorks Islands. &lt;blockquote&gt; "we saw many beaver and some otter today; the former dam up the small channels of the river between the islands and compell the river in these parts to make other channels; which as soon as it has effected that which was stopped by the beaver becomes dry and is filled up with mud sand gravel and driftwood.  the beaver is then compelled to seek another spot for his habitation wher[e] he again erects his dam.  thus the river in many places among the clusters of islands is constantly changing the direction of such sluices as the beaver are capable of stoping or of 20 yds in width.  this anamal in that way I believe to be very instrumental in adding to the number of islands with which we find the river crouded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onewest.net/~inmontana/crimsonbluffs/Yorks-Islands.htm |title=Yorks Island Fishing Access Commemorations |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507002936/http://www.onewest.net/~inmontana/crimsonbluffs/Yorks-Islands.htm |archivedate=May 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The captains followed the practice of naming geographic features after prominent persons who somehow had been connected with the expedition, particularly the President and members of his [[Presidential cabinet|cabinet]], (viz Jefferson, Madison, and [[Albert Gallatin|Gallatin]] Rivers) or attributes of President Jefferson (viz. Philanthropy, Philosophy, and Wisdom Rivers).  In addition, as far as can be determined, a geographic feature was named for every Corps member, including [[Seaman]], Lewis’s Newfoundland dog.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/lewisandclark/inside/york.html "York", part of PBS Site, "Inside the Corps"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507161617/http://www.pbs.org/lewisandclark/inside/york.html |date=2015-05-07 }} PBS, "Inside the Corps", Article on "York"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806, on the return leg of the expedition down the Yellowstone River, Clark also named another geographical feature for York, "York's Dry Creek", a tributary of the Yellowstone River, in [[Custer County, Montana|Custer County]], [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travellogs.us/2007Logs/Montana%202007/131-Townsend/131dd-Yorks%20Islands.htm Yorks Islands from Lewis and Clark]&lt;/ref&gt;  This name did not stick and the creek became known as "Custer Creek".

==Official Recognition of nomenclature "Yorks Islands"==

Though the name for "Yorks 8 Islands" appears on Clark's 1805 maps of the expeditions travel along the Missouri for July 24, 1805, the geographical designation for "Yorks Islands" was not officially confirmed until 2000, when the U.S. Board on Geographic Names&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/ USGS, U.S. Board on Geographic Names]&lt;/ref&gt; approved the name Yorks Islands for the group of Missouri River islands in Broadwater County.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=154:2:3589439785990734::NO:RP:: USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) entry for "Yorks Islands"]&lt;/ref&gt; The name was also approved by the Montana Board on Geographic Names and has been entered into the Nation’s official automated geographic names repository.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onewest.net/~inmontana/crimsonbluffs/Yorks-Islands.htm Yorks Islands Fishing Access Commemoration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507002936/http://www.onewest.net/~inmontana/crimsonbluffs/Yorks-Islands.htm |date=May 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The USGS ([[United States Geological Survey]]) [[Geographic Names Information System]] has settled on "Yorks Islands".  However, the area is also called "York's Islands", or simply "York Island".
